      Welcome my friends, to my first blog.  What is a blog you ask? No? Ok good, because I'm not even sure if i know what one is myself.  Umm lets see. I'm eating pineapple. im wondering who, if anyone, is going to read this. I wonder how long this entry will be. I wonder how long the whole thing will be. I'm wondering if i wonder too much.  Alright, well in case you dont know, my name is Matt.  I live in the town of Gig Harbor, in Washington state. I've only been living there for a year now so I'm not really sure how to describe it.  There's something about the people there that I just don't like... But there's something about nearly all people I just don't like.  I like my old town better, in Port Townsend, probably because it's more familiar than my new one.  I'm in Port Townsend at the time that I'm writing this, because I'm visiting for the summer.  Too bad all my friends won't call me back or are never home or some stupid thing.  I never get to hang with any of them.  Occasionally I question my friendships. But what can I do, but sit at home and stare at a computer screen for hours and hours, trying to escape the boredom of it all. I must admit, it does beat school though.  I wonder where all of my "friends" are right now... what they are doing... wonder if they ever care to think about me.  Maybe a blog is just something to write down all of your thoughts to let everything out, in the hope that someone will read it and care.  I hope you don't mind me complaining a lot. I wonder if anyone I know will read this. I find the chances unlikely.  I wonder if I'm writing interestingly enough to keep the reader's attention. I think I stopped caring. This blog is declared for me to look back on and reflect upon. I'll call it a night. Good night readers. I hope the next one is more interesting

      sarcasm.  i hate it. i really dislike sarcastic people... what is sarcasm? sarcasm is sort of like a lie, that insults another person(s) intelligence.  most of the time i believe sarcasm, because of my trust in others.  i mean, i would want other people to trust me, so i treat them the same... thats about all i gotta say about sarcasm.

      reviewing all of my previous work in this blog, ive come to realize that im writing mostly about alisha.  sometimes i wonder if ive become too obsessed with her, she is the wrong person to really attach myself to, so ive tried avioding that.  anyways, my mom set up a surprise going away party for my brother, who is joining the air force on the 20th, and we are getting the house ready for that right now.  i hope daniels friends can maybe make me feel a little better, or ill just run away to the field or call justin or somethin.  i believe that everything happens for a reason. maybe this little episode of mine happened, so ill be inspired to write songs and become famous or something... i sure hope so.  c ya

      last night.. i had some strange dreams.  i dont remember them vividly, but the more interesting one was really breif.  i was on a bus going to school, and there was the girl i was attracted to, a year younger than me, sitting in the seat across from me.  she said hi and i accidentally said, "oh, hi alisha" (her name wasnt alisha) then put my face over my hands and apologized. she said it was alright. thats about the end of that one. the only other dream i remember from last night was that i was in an electric wheel chair, zooming around a hospital, though i wasnt disabled. just really bored i guess.  i walked outside of the hospital and it was on top of a hill, towering over a green grassy land with blue skies.  oh yes, and the other dream.  i was in the front passenger seat of a really fast car and i was with like the national lampoons family but we were driving realllly fast down a freeway and the dad was passing people by going off the road. it was crazy.  so we decided that the mom should drive, and while she was driving safely, she asked me, "dont you kids play crashing games at your age?" and im like uhh no... then the dream ended.  that ends this post.

      Well people, everyone has a story, and this is the story of my life.  I figure I should finally publish it.           In the seventh grade, I used to go to this youth group with my friends, these skateboarder kids who were real badasses. They only attended it to steal otter pops, knock over chairs, and cause chaos during the games, so it was pretty fun.  It was located at the Calvery Chapel, a nice new church, all the people there were cool and friendly, so i liked it.  Eventually i started singing the songs in worship, and later playing the piano for them.           Anyways, I kept this weekly ritual up for years, and in high school the skateboarder kids stopped going.  I continued to go though, and was pretty good friends with Justin, the "good" kid I knew from school and the youth group.  Justin had a girlfriend named Whitney.  I had known Whitney from my old school, in Chimicum. I attended school there in grades 2-4, then moved to Port Townsend.  Later during middle school Whitney moved also, and thats about the time they started going out.           So every once in a while, the youth group would go on a trip somewhere and the kids could come, but usually it costed money.  During my freshman year in high school, I was informed that they were planning on attending the 4-5 day long Creation 2002 Festival, at the Gorge in summer.  I had heard about how fun it was the year before.  It costed somewhere around $110, but my parents decided to pay for it because, you know, it was church-oriented and all.           The group that was going had to get an early start for the four hour ride to the Gorge.  You could choose either to spend the night at the church, or to arrive early and catch the church vans.  Most of us stayed the night                                                                            CHAPTER 2          In the church, the girls were to sleep in the room where the sevice is held, and the guys were to sleep in this other room that the youth group sometimes sang in.  I didn't want to sleep yet, as it wasn't really late, so I hopped up on the piano, I don't think anyone minded... eventually i had a small audience.  So, as I was playing mozart with my eyes closed, a girl sat next to me on the bench.  She was attractive, had short pink hair and had brought some hair dye apparently, as she was asking if she could dye mine.  I told her that i hadn't really done anything to my hair before, it was just plain ol' straight brown and floppy.   I started giving in, asking how long it lasted, etc... next thing i knew, I was too into my piece, that she had already gotten the dye and started to put it in my hair.  It was late, and it would wash out, so I just let her do it.  Before i went to bed, I went to brush my teeth in the bathroom.   When I looked in the mirror, i noticed that my hair looked like a big tongue licked it, and it had strange tints of pink and green or blue in it.  I washed it out, dried it then went to bed.  That was my first of many experiences with this girl...          The next morning, we all had to wake up early, load up the vans, and ride the four hours to the Gorge.  I rode with Justin, Whitney, and the girl i had met the night before.  Some tried to catch up on some sleep on the way there, and i decided to do so as well.  I couldnt find a really comfortable position to sleep in, so it kinda sucked.  We made a few bathroom breaks and bought some snacks that we ate on the way there, and finally arrived.            The weather at the Gorge was about 100 degrees, but we had plenty of nice water to drink or splash each other with.  We set up camp at our site, then conversed with each other.  I was introduced to Alisha that day by Whitney and Justin, in fact, as I learned that Whitney and Alisha were stepsisters.  Alisha, I think it was, told me that she was just sent to hang out with me because Whitney wanted more alone time with my best friend then, Justin.  I laughed and said that he was always telling me about that...          Alisha asked if i would go in the mosh pit with her.  I'd never been in a mosh pit, but how bad could it get in a christian concert anyways, so it was the first thing the two of us did. Another guy named Travis came along too, who was friends with Alisha.  Pretty cool guy. I don't exactly remember what was playing in the mosh pit, but I remember that Alisha wanted to go to the front and would push through people to get right in front of the stage.  I, on the other hand, was always considerate and polite of others.. unless peer pressure was involved.  So Alisha reached out, implying that she wanted to pull me through the other people, so i took her hand and she pulled me on through, all the way to the front.  I sorta liked her.  We did this every day when we were in the crowd.  Another thing Alisha and I did was steal this caution tape and make sashes and belts and always sit and walk together.  The youth group people called us the "caution king and caution queen".  It was really fun.  Alisha even spiked my hair one day, it was so awesome just being different that day.          About halfway through the festival, I still remember it was July 26th, Travis asked me if i liked Alisha, and I said yeah.  He asked if he wanted help getting us together, I said that would be great, as all of my previous attempts with girls had failed...  So he asked her if she would go out with me if I were to ask, and she said she would.  Travis didn't recommend that I ask her though.  Anyways, I went ahead and asked her in some sort of dorky manner... She said yes, and I was very pleased.  We sat together that night at around 2 am, looked at the stars, and talked.  Eventually we decided to go to bed.         The next day, we moshed around, ate food, and all that good stuff.  Around 10-11, when it was dark, we were still down in the main stage, deep within all of the people... There was a PDA rule that i never really thought I'D break, but a slow song came on and I put my arms around her waist.  She responded by holding onto both of my hands, and we rocked... Her hair smelled so nice, and it was so warm in there.  I kissed her on the cheek sometime during all of that.  We did this for the remaining 1-2 days that were left of the whole thing.         It was finally time to go home, and by now it was probably obvious that we had a thing for each other.  Since Alisha and I had stayed up late the night before, and had woken up early that morning, we were both really tired, and she decided to sleep the whole way home.  She put a pillow on my lap, and just conked out.  Someone offered me a pillow, since I also wanted to sleep, and I slept on it against the window.  I remember that that moment was the most that I had felt loved in my life.  Before that, I couldn't sleep in a car since this truck accident I was in when I was 8.                                                                                    CHAPTER 3         Sometime during the trip, I had found out that Alisha had recently moved in about two blocks away from me.  This was convenient.  We visited each other often, I got to know her family, etc... At the time, it was early in August, and the nights there were very clear and warm.  I called her and we planned to sneak out, because we weren't really allowed to be alone together, due to her "bad" past.  I knew the area pretty well, so i could show her around and we could talk.  It's all I really planned on doing.          We set up a time and met about halfway, on this trail between our houses, at about 1 in the morning.  She had brought a blanket which was an excellent idea, as I chose to go to this field I knew of behind an elementary school.  As we walked up there, you could hardly see the stars until you really got further into the field, because of the lights in the parking lot at the school.  We found a place to set the blanket down, and sat on it.  There, we talked for a couple hours, and really got to know each other.  Eventually it got to the point where I told her that I had never really kissed a girl, so soon enough, we were making out and all that fun stuff.  That night, I saw a shooting star hit the atmosphere and explode, but she was looking down on me, and not at the sky so all she saw was a flash.  It was pretty awesome.          We snuck out two more times, the second time, my brother and his friend tried to spy on us.  Sigh.. dumb brother.  So Alisha and I were talking not really about anything, and we heard this "CRASH, CRASH, CRASH......scrunch scrunch.."  I knew immediately it was my brother and his friend, and to make it even more obvious, there was a flashlight beaming around in every direction.  Alisha and I got up and ditched them, to go to the roof of the school instead.  We laid the blanket down, and I think i had brought one along too, and put it over us to stay warm.  Did the same stuff we did the night before, it was cool.           The third time we snuck out, Alisha wasn't really sure if we should, because her mom was starting to catch on, and if she were to get caught they would send her to some correction school or something, far away.  When we went out to the field, we saw numerous more shooting stars, and when I was looking directly into her eyes, they lit up bright white, followed by her face, hair, the field, then the trees surrounding us, bright as daylight for a couple seconds.  She just saw a star explode like the one I had seen before, and commented on something like how amazing it was.              After a while, I kept trying to keep in touch with her, but usually never could.  About a week after we snuck out, she called and told me she was sneaking out and going to Fort Warden with her old friends from Chimicum. She told me she was going to get really wasted and smoke. I was very dissatisfied, as I had always stayed away from the stuff, and we sort of mutually decided that it was best if I stayed home.              The night finally came that she told me about, and she said she would see me the next day at the youth group.  I didn't see her the next day at the youth group, and after waiting at the athletic club with the group for about an hour, I asked my friend Justin if he had any clue where Alisha was.  He was sort of acting strange and told me to ask Whitney.  I knew something was up.  I asked Whitney where Alisha was and she said that she got caught sneaking out the night before and was going to be sent to a boarding school somewhere in a different state.  I looked out the window and silently cried the rest of the way back to the church.           This sucked more than anything else for me, but to make things worse, I later found out from their mom that she slept with some guy that night.  Yeah it was hell for me then.  Her family let me spend the night at their house that night because I was so sad.  I remember crying myself to sleep, and waking up crying.  How fun.           So, I felt that I really needed to talk to Alisha, and hear the story from her, but I just couldn't get ahold of her.  She wasn't allowed to talk with anyone at all, and was staying at her grandparent's house until she left for the school in Texas.  Two weeks after not being able to talk with her, I saw her online.  Her grandpa was angry at her dad for his choice, and let her on the computer for a while.  We talked for a while and I had some questions to ask her... She denied all of the bad stuff that I heard happened.  I later found out from a couple people that she had been seeing this other guy, as I suspected.  Since then, I had really found a strong disliking for lies, and commited myself to being honest as often as possible from then on.             Eventually, I saw her online the night before she had to leave.  I needed to see her for one last time, before she left for almost a year.  My brother's friend, Jacob decided to drive the distance out to chimicum, and was even late for work, but I saw her for a disappointing five more minutes before she shut the door in my face, probably only partially due to an angry grandmother in the background of the doorway.  It was pretty heartbreaking, but I was still glad I saw her that last time.             For the first few months after that, I prayed for her every night and I thought about her every day.  I wondered if she still loved me.  I wondered if she ever did.  I wrote many emails and letters to her that I tried sending every way I could, but none of them were permitted to reach her.  So I waited for the longest 10 months of my life, when I finally found out that she came back.                                                                                                CHAPTER 4           When Alisha came back, her family was no longer living in the same town as me.  Even though she was home again, I still couldn't see her for a couple more months.  The next time I saw her was actually at Creation Fest 2003.  Her family said I could come with them that time, because the youth group didn't go that year, and I accepted.  I had no clue what to expect.          The time came and they picked me up in a van in the afternoon, a day before the Concert started.  We planned on staying in a hotel.  So we arrived at the hotel after a couple hours and were assigned rooms.  I saw Alisha for the first time in a year then, and boy was she looking more beautiful than ever.  Her hair was longer and brown, instead of bleach blond with pink dye.  She had a nice tan now too.  We just kind of exchanged glances at each other every now and then, not knowing what to expect from the other.  After a short while, we went to bed in our seperate rooms.          The next day, I was anxious to see Alisha.  We didn't talk much until after we set up camp.  We sort of talked like nothing really happened.  It was just easier that way.  We ended up becoming more and more friends with each other, we played cards, laughed, joked, even designed some more accessories with stolen caution tape.  Eventually the time came again when it was dark, and the slow music was played again, like a familiar memory.  I was close by Alisha and as our small group was headed closer and closer to the stage, the people became more concentrated, until we were packed in there nice and tight.  I was making pretty close contact with her and later throughout the night, I decided to just take my chances and put my arms around her to hold her.  She then, like before, put her hands over mine, and we rocked slowly to the music. How great it was to have a moment with her again...           We had a great time at Creation, and the time came when we had to go home.  After that, we never really saw each other because school had started, and unfortunately, when she switched to Port Townsend High, I started living with my dad in Gig Harbor so I could only really visit my old town during long breaks.  So I dedicated winter break to going back to my old town to see my old friends again.  By chance, I saw Alisha, and we hugged and talked and all that.  I don't really remember if i was comfortable around her or not then, but it was nice seeing her.           That was the last time I saw her until this summer, and between now and then, we kept in touch with the messenger.  At one time or another, she apologized for what she did.  I was so happy and relieved, and felt a bit lighter.  Also, I found in one of my email folders, that I had actually saved one of the letters I had written to her, read it through, then sent it to her, hoping she would like it.  She said it was very sweet.  I ended up getting her cell phone number before I found out I was visiting my mom back in town, and we arranged to see each other.           You can find the 5th chapter of my story in the earlier posts in my blog.  Hope you enjoyed reading this. Phew.

      this new post is probably the most needed one that ive written.  none of my friends care. i realize this.  who wants to hear my ramble about sad stories of my life? cmon.  well.. i just got back from downtown wish alisha. shit i wanted to talk with her. i am saying random cuss words every so often.  alisha has someone...  hes a cool guy, hes my friend. i am even happy for her. you see though... she thought she told me about him... i didnt know. my mindset totally changed after she kissed him... i didnt want to be sad.  i couldnt hide it. she was the only one that ive loved.  i will get over it. i need to start looking at her as a friend.  she is a cool person.  i need a good friend right now. god i hope i didnt make things awkward.  i plan for the worst, but i totally didnt see that coming.   what the fuck is up with it all...  i couldnt stop like sighing and crap and it mustve shown that i was angry.. eventually, i told her i loved her, i told her i was going to start crying and i needed to go home.  she has been so kind to me.  a few years back, i kinda made a vow that i didnt want anyone feeling sorry for me. i could NOT hold my emotion in.  girls are always like, oh guys are jerks guys use you, etc... ive been striving to not be that kind of person for years now.  i couldnt be a jerk if i tried.  i really hope they get along.  they are both great people.. i hope i find someone too though honestly.  shit i cant even get a girlfriend.  alisha is one of a kind. is there anyone out there for me?  i suppose life isnt over.  i cant help but wonder what she is thinking right now.  well maybe our true colors will show, things will finally settle.  i.. so need to move on, but i cant. love is forever.  i have learned a lot from all of this.. what the hell it seems like i hit a total dead end.  we will see what happens. for now, i have to write a nice long email to her.  see ya folks.

      woke up about a half hour ago, because alisha called.  shes pickin me up at one, which is good because it gives me enough time to wash some clothes. so yeah, im in a towel eating a toasted onion bagel with lox and cream cheese. its pretty good. its raining for the first time in a long time.. maybe its a sign? its how my mind works. i like the rain though so it must be a good sign. i just want it to pour and get everything soaking wet. i just popped my cd in, put it on random, the Norwegian song came on, "En Solskinnsdag".  why norwegian? well im going to norway for two weeks in august to visit an exchange student who came here for a year. learning the language pretty well too. anyways, i have really come to enjoy this blog thing so far.  ran out of ideas. you pretty much know the usual, just thinking about her. we will have a good time i know it, we always have. anyways im gonna go and brush my teeth and get ready.. by waiting for my clothes to wash.  c ya bloggy.

      long ago, i came across alishas blog. it has probably influenced me into writing this one in fact. since then, the server for her blog was shut down, leaving it gone forever. i dont remember any of it except something about relatives and christmas.  i guess a blog is like an online journal? its whatever you make of it.  hey justin, whats up, i think youre the only person who has read this so far. read often, there will be more to come. you (anyone) should start one, theyre pretty cool. ill leave it at that for now, unless any other random thoughts decide to invade my mind once again...

      mmm. doesnt the title of this one just make you hungry? rancid pig blood smells something like vomit you could say.&nbsp; i had to scrub pig blood off of the floor of the garage today.&nbsp; it was stuck on like glue, and we need a new sponge now because i had to scrub the floor so hard. yeah my dads just been pissin me off lately with all of this work he has been throwing on me.&nbsp; im considering not doing any of it if he takes the computer keyboard away, because theres nothing he can ground me from after that.&nbsp; i might just go take a bus to my old town or something and live there for a while. anyways im going to wait for my dad to call and have an arguement with him, then go clean the garage some more. hope you are all having a fine day today.

      about a week or two ago, i started writing another song, but this time i had the persistence to finish it, complete with lyrics.  i dont have to tell you what its about...      Memories by Matt Wagner  1 They say your first love always hurts the most and now I know that isn't just a joke I knew a girl when i was 15 years or so she was the only love I'd ever known.  2 I met her at a concert on a hot sunny day we laughed and we talked and everything was ok When the stars came out I would hold her tight and we'd rock and we'd sway for the rest of the night  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, if you lost that someone just remember this song and the memories you shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and you were lonely and scared  (music...)  3 We used to sneak out and we'd stare at the sky to see if any shootin stars would fly by. It's memories like those that I'll never forget, I wish I could go back to the day we first met  4 (slower) I saw you with him the other day and I tried but I couldn't keep the tears from my face I hope that he's the best in the world because your still my favorite girl  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, I've lost that someone and I've written this song about the memories that I shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and my hearts lonely and scared  (music...end)

      this post is about my dad. not like a life story. just about how he can piss me off. actually that would be too long, ill just tell you what happened today. so we were ridin along in the car, after we watched the bourne supremacy, and it was pretty damn good, and he gets into the same old arguement: "you dont do anything around the house!! bla bla bla bla!!!" (yeah he actually says bla bla bla...jk) and hes like, "im bustin my balls for you, are you bustin your balls for me?" and im like "no". i answered in simple one-word sentences, because thats all i could do, as he wouldnt let me reply. like always. so eventually, hes like, bla bla bla, ive done all this stuff for you, i feed you, im sending you to norway (which was because i got good grades this last semester and that was the deal, but he still uses it against me), youre living under my roof, bla bla bla. and im just thinking all this time, "you dumbass, why dont you just take it all away from me then if im not giving back?" see, this is what i @#$ing HATE about my dad and my brother. they dont understand what it means to "give" something. it means to pass it on to another person, WITHOUT expecting anything in return or ESPECIALLY using it against them later!!! i dont take anything my dad gives me now, its gotten so bad.&nbsp; anyways, my dads like dont you want a car? bla bla bla.... and im like no, not really, i dont need a car at the moment. and hes like, youll need a car, bla bla bla. and im like no i dont, i have a bike and a bus, and they can get me anywhere. so hes like, "well, i want you to have a car, and youre gonna have to earn it, and whos gonna pay for gas? and whos gonna pay for insurance? me." and im like no, if i want something that bad, i can get it. i told him i wanted to be completely independent of him. basically meaning that he has nothing on me. because he really thinks he does.  so anyways, today, since i was grounded from the computer for a while, this girl i know online called me to say hi and see if i was doin alright and all, so my dad picked the phone up and gave it to me, and we talked for a while, then my dads like, whos that? and im like this girl from elma. and hes like, does she drive? and im like, i dont know, it doesnt matter. and hes like, well if she can drive, then she can come up here and you can go on a date or something and im like uhh shes got a boyfriend. and hes like "what the fu...."&nbsp; and im like, "what do you mean "what the fuck"? can i be friends with girls?" and hes like, "someday youll know". and that pissed me off kinda.&nbsp; he basically thinks american women.. just suck. and they want money, and are bitchy, and all this other stuff. it seems to have been true with the girls hes been dating here, but i dont believe it.&nbsp; he probably just thinks theyre good for fucking.&nbsp; either way, he does not influence me very much, if any at all. id like to learn on my own. my brother and i have different tastes in relationships, and my dad kinda has the same thing going as my brother. you know, like, oh theres girls over here and girls over there, lets do them all in one night. and im like.. yeah.. im gonna pass on all that. i only wanted one person really. when .. i was a christian (i am not anymore, but dont get me wrong, i am no satan worshipper, i still have values too :). ) it mustve rubbed off on me, you know, all that pre-marital sex stuff. also, you know, the STDs, the baby risk,&nbsp;all that shit. id rather just avoid it all.&nbsp; yeah... the christianity thing. i wasnt gonna really post it. all its caused me is a lot of grief and shame though, theres no evidence of it all... why believe something that just hurts me. i live life to the fullest, as no one knows whats on the other side truly. i hate getting in religious debates on all of this crap, because it cant be proven or disproven. its a faith thing. no reason to believe, but they still do anyways. ive lost it. people join christianity, i think, because all of the people there are accepting and happy, and they think its a cool place to be, pretty soon, youre singin the songs too, etc, and you grow stronger off of that, well,&nbsp;insufficient evidence&nbsp;that got you started in the first place. my dad needs to get on now (of course.). what do you know, more work. c ya

      hello people, i got up at around 6 this morning because it was too damn hot to sleep anymore.&nbsp; according to my dads truck thermometer, it was 98 degrees out yesterday, and my dad said it was supposed to be hotter today. i think the weather is affecting my personality somehow, so forgive me, my friends, if im grumpy or crazy or something.&nbsp; i like to keep my blogs short. c ya.

      hey hey my friends, this blog cant be too long, so ill try and summarize it a bit. basically, my dad grounded me for being lazy and not cleaning anything, i started the harry potter 5th book, about half way through now (vegard left it for me (for those of you who dont know vegard... hes the norwegian guy im visiting in norway.) , and i rode my bike to the store and back twice today in nearly 90 degree weather and probably got some color on me. it mustve been 8 miles total but i got home and i felt great. i basically only did it to prove to my dad that i wasnt lazy, if i wanted something i could get it.&nbsp; yeah so ive been feeling really good today, dont know if it was&nbsp; the bike ride, or the pushups, or the book, or the&nbsp;tarantula :P&nbsp;or the freaking hotness outside or the ice cream i got. or all of it. but yeah i feel good.&nbsp;i hope to get back to this blog soon. maybe it was a good thing i left the computer. naaaa... what else was i gonna say. ok today i found out my great grandmother, ilene petersen, is norwegian, so that makes me 1/8 norwegian if i did the math correctly. anyways, theres no telling when, or if, ill be on the computer again, so i wish you a merry life. if i forgot anything, ill get back to you all.

      so today we went to oslo. it was real rad and i bought a couple cds and sunglasses and stuff. so i went up to this slot machine and popped in some money and lost badly. then i popped in more money and lost badly again when i left, some other guy came up and played the same machine (he was waiting for me to lose a whole bunch or something...) and he won lotsa money and i was like wtf. then i went to the currency exchange place and came back to the machine and popped in some more money and lost pretty bad. i put in my last 20 kroners and the machine freakin ate it. nothing happened. i was forced to take it as a sign that gambling is bad. and there was nothing i could do cuz i wasnt even 18. :P but all in all, i lost about 40 bucks to the slot machine and it was a shitty deal and i was all melancholy after that. no, i wasnt sitting there for hours at a time staring at the little fruit icons. it was rather quick actually.  later we joked about taking a baseball bat to the damned thing... and on the way back, there was this vending machine on the bus, and my friend raymond went to get something on it, and the freakin machine jammed up. its like im never gonna trust a machine with my money again. bastards..... ill stick to poker.  this makes me look like a gambling addict. i am not proud. anyways, even if there were slot machines in grocery stores in america, i wouldnt even look at one now. my dad called today also, and i tried to make up an explanation to him why i lost all my money and it sorta flew. phew. tomorrow were canoeing to sweden. its gonna be swedish. thats about all i have to say, im gonna stock up on candy and crap with my last 100 kroner.  bengers. i need some sleep... hade

      so im going to oslo tomorrow as a tourist.. my dad wanted me to visit an art ... holy crap i forgot how to spell museum. oh there it is. anyways, were going to this art museum and im gonna get a poster for my dad and its gonna be cool. im gonna challenge the slot machines once more when im there.  other than that, i took some pictures of some stuff today, like scenery and my friends here.  in two days, im going to sweden for 3 days so that will kick ass. swedish. i bought 10 bars of chocolate... mm norwegian chocolate is the best ive had.  i wonder if people get tired of me writing about "me, me, me, i did this, i did that, i think this, i think that........". i apologize if you dont care. but if you dont care then why are you still reading this. ok i think i just answered my own question again. anyways, its sort of late here, like 10:42, so im gonna end this one here. have a good time

      alright even though im 17, no one cares if i use the slot machines in norway (the age limit is 18). so, due to my gambling obsession (you'd have one too if you won all the time) i played this slot machine. i was about 50 kroner in the hole (roughly 8 bucks) and i couldnt understand how to cash out so i kept losing, then i ate my hamburger and came back to it. i had only about 40 kroner left and i was nearly down to my last few coins, then i won 80 kroner. so i then decided to do the double or nothin feature on the machine, and i got 160 kroner, then cashed out. all in all, i won about 10 bucks american :P. yeah im going to play again sometime and im probably going to lose, but oh well. have fun my friends. and if you see me sitting in an alley somewhere in vegas please be so kind and give me a few cents. thanks.

      yeah its a nerdy title. anyways, when i came back from norway, i was looking forward to getting on the computer to talk to all my online buddies, but the freaking keyboard was gone. so im like oh. shit. so the next morning, i woke up at the same time as my dad, and tried to fall asleep, but couldnt because i was hungry, and not tired at all (probably still recovering from norwegian time..). so i sat in bed, and i was going to get up and shower while my dad was still there, when i remembered a little plan i had made... when my dad was almost out the door, i used my keen sense of hearing to listen to him carry the keyboard past my room, and into the closet near the front door... after he left, i searched around, and looked on the shelf in the closet, and sure enough, it was there. there is justice in the world after all. so ill probably be on the computer forever now, since there is nothing much else to do except make more lattes. thats the story for the day... nothing else much new. when my dad took the keyboard, he said, "its for your own good" or something like that. and im thinking wtf. but now im thinking, "my dad did a mediocre job of hiding the keyboard and i found it pretty easily and im happy now."                                                  The End
