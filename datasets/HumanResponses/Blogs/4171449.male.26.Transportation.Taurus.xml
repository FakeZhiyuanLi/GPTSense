       urlLink Movie Poop Shoot - Comics 101   I had absolutely no idea that this site was still operational.  I have a vague memory of visiting it when  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back  was released but haven't been back since, as I thought it was a one-note site.  But I guess so many other people visited that it got turned into a legitimate movie news website (well, kinda).  Interesting stuff though, fascinating in some cases.  If you have any interest in the recent spate of comic-to-movie translations and need a refresher on the source material this is a pretty good place to look.  And a tip 'o the fez to Parish for linking to this in one of his articles.  I'ma waste so much time reading this stuff...  I'll be out of town the next couple days at a friend's in Tahoe.  This would be the pre-explanation of my lack of content.

      I went out to meet a friend last night for dinner after work.  Unfortunately, due to our differing schedules it was a logistical nightmare.  I started work right about the time she got done... and when I got home at eight she'd left 3 messages for me.  We agreed to meet in Sacramento for dinner at 8:45, which I thought would give me enough time to get cleaned up and such.  No such luck though... I took the wrong branch of Highway 80 and several wrong turns later... well, long story short I ended up being about half an hour later than I thought I'd be.  Fortunately Amy has nearly infinite patience and was still waiting for me when I got there.  It was nice to see her, prior to the wedding it had been a few months before I had done so.  I hope I didn't scare her, but I was ravenous by the time the food arrived.  Unfortunately our time was all too brief, as the restaurant closed at 10pm.  We left each other with the vague promise to do this more often, scheduling nightmare or no....  time will tell whether that's a pipe dream.

      Oops, I forgot to give this one a title, so it just gave the post the whole first paragraph as a name, and I can't figure out how to edit it.  Oh well, could be worse.    Incidentally, the word "D'oh!" is a result of the somewhat stricter decency standards the Fox network had when it was just starting out.  It's a truncation of Dan Castellaneta beginning to swear, then catching himself... "Damn! Oh!"  Simpsons scripts have never included the word "D'oh!" in them, it's always written as "Annoyed grunt."  This is carried to extremes in some cases.... the musical "Shari Bobbins" episode was officially titled "Supercalifragilisticexpialiannoyedgruntcious."  It's amazing what you can learn by listening to the audio commentary on DVDs.  I'll end this now due to a shortage of quotation marks and a lack of general interest.

      Those of you playing along at home may have noticed that once again, I missed a couple days there.  At least I have a good excuse... well, an excuse, anyway.    Over the last couple of days, I've been all over the place; this is primarily due to the wedding of my friends Melissa and Charlie.  I've known both of them for what seems like forever, though it's really only been a little less than ten years.  Charlie's probably my best friend in our group, he's at least the one I hang around with most.  Melissa is my friend Jeremy's little sister, and she's a good friend in her own right.  Their family doesn't seem to have the rancorous sibling rivalry that I've seen in others, maybe they're just better at hiding it.  In any case, Melissa and Charlie were both inducted into our group of friends early on and have been the instigators on some of our more memorable adventures.    To understand these two, maybe a story would help.  Charlie's proposal was a bit odd, even by our standards.  Keep in mind that this is all second-hand information.  New year's Eve two years ago we were all invited to Monika's for a party.  Traditionally, we had done New Year's at Jeremy and Melissa's father's house, but that year Jeremy was in his apartment so it would have been difficult to get our whole crew in there.  Anyway, Monika wanted to do a themed New Year's party, and what Monika wants, Monika usually gets (She has that effect on males).  The theme she chose was "Tropical," and it was left to the invitation's recipient to interpret how best to fit the theme.  As an example, the invitation featured a smiling, grass-skirt-clad pineapple holding a ukelele.  Wacky!  Woo!  (I just spent a little time searching for that invitation, but was unsuccessful... perhaps later.)  Melissa and Charlie have taken bargain-hunting to an art form.  Melissa inherited frugality from her father, who as I understand it is no slouch on the garage-sale circuit himself.  Whether the trait is innate or learned is a question for the philosophers.  My gut would be innate, because her two brothers don't seem to share it, or at least to display it in any such prominence.  The point of bringing this up is to set the scene for you;  recently Charlie had acquired a wetsuit on one of their excursions, and Monika's party seemed like a good excuse to make use of it.  Certainly, it would be the first chance for a while... ocean trips, even in California, are best reserved for the summer months.  Charlie went to Melissa's to change before the party.  Unbeknownst to any of us, he had something extra in his wetsuit.  He had really gone all out in full surfer regalia, including flippers and a styrafoam surfboard.  From what I was told of the story, in the middle of the hall he got down on one knee (which apparently took some maneuvering), pulled out a ring and popped the question.  To say Melissa was surprised would be an understatement.  Anyway, flash forward to the present.  As I've said before, Mel and Charlie are two of my oldest and best friends, so it was my honor and privilege to act as a groomsman for them yesterday.  It wasn't difficult, as they provided the tuxedo and even the shoes so that all I had to do was show up and look pretty.  THAT'S a job I can do in my sleep.  Well... maybe.  Never looked in a mirror with my eyes closed.  I might have huge centipedes tattooed on my eyelids for all I know.    Why was I a groomsman and not best man?  There's a couple of reasons.  In no particular order...  For starters, Charlie wanted a LAN party for his bachelor party.  In my current living quarters this is possible, but at the time the decision had to be made, it was not.  Remind me to write something about my year of hell at some future point.  Second is the family factor.  By asking Jeremy and (later) Matt (Jere and Mel's younger brother) to fill that role, their bonds as a family were strengthened.  Matt stepped up for the ailing Jeremy, who managed to contract Mononucleosis (Spelled that without looking it up, RAR!) the week before the wedding.  Truthfully, I think I got the better end of the deal.  I didn't have to give a speech, I got to eat before anyone else (excluding the other members of the wedding party) and my sole responsibilities were to walk Charlie's mom down the aisle and his sister back up it.  Well, I also had to look  urlLink SO GOOD , but that's easy when you're me.  ( I'm not this conceited in real life... I project a different persona in this here Internet thing.)  So between the rehearsal and dinner on Friday night, and the ceremony, reception, and after-party last night, I didn't get near a computer.  Sundays are a bit better, but I sitll had to drop off the tuxes, having volunteered to do so by reason of proximity.  And I still had my parent's dinner to go to as I do every Sunday evening.  I couldn't back out on that this week especially because my grandparents also came over.    I went a little long here and still didn't touch on half the stuff I wanted to... that proposal story turned into an essay.  And now it's my bedtime.  Oh well.  Plenty more black space to fill tomorrow.

      I just finished reading " urlLink The Kid Stays in the Picture " by Robert Evans.  It's a quick read, very much an R-rated book.  Evans refers to himself and other like him as "cocksmen" which should give some idea of the rest of the tome's content.  But any book about Hollywood that ends with the line "F**k 'em, F**k 'em all."  is fine by me.  Anyway, it makes me want to see the  urlLink movie  based on the book.  Evans has had a fascinating life, and wasn't shy about telling tales about himself... the honesty of the book makes it far more interesting than a work of fiction on the same subject.    Oh, and "Keed" is what Jack Nicholson (his best friend) calls Evans, Evans reciprocates with "Irish."  Again, not particularly interesting, but now you have it in your brain so you're stuck with it.

       urlLink Peasant's Quest   Anyone who has ever typed "Sling rock at guard" or "Smear berries on self"  should have some fond memories rekindled playing this Sierragames Kings/Space quest parody, absolutely free from  urlLink Videlectrix  and  urlLink Homestarrunner.com ...  It took me a few hours, but I've seen the ending.  Haven't gotten a perfect score yet though.

      I know nobody's reading this stuff yet, but surely if anyone comes across this in some future archive dive they may note that there is no entry for yesterday.  Well, I didn't write anything yesterday because I was too tired to turn the computer on when I got home last night.  Usually when I miss one day of something I'm supposed to do daily, I become disheartened and give in to apathy, having the best of intentions to get back to it but never following up on them.  The road to hell, yada yada yada.  So consider yourself lucky... I got back up on the horse today.  Two days ago I wrote that I had had a job interview, but didn't say anything about it.  Well, abscence of news is often worse than the news itself, and that is precisely the position I find myself in currently.  I don't think I did very well in the interview... in addition to admitting I've been late many many times in the last year due to my geographic stupidity, I bombed one of the interview questions worse than downtown Nagasaki.  The question:  "Give an example of a time you had to make a decision on your own."  My answer:  When I was working as an audio-video installer, and was in someone's attic splicing wires together, sometimes I had to make do with what I had."  So far, so good.  "So instead of coming all the way out of the attic to get a tool, sometimes I had to just twist wires together instead of soldering them."  Bad, but perhaps I can pull up, right? No, I kept babbling.  "It's not quite as good as soldering, but... (trails off into nothingness)"  "Umm, that's probably not the best example I could give."  Interviewer:  "You can give another example if you like."  Me:  "....."  Arrggh.  Well, at least I'll know within the week how badly I blew it.    There's a whole list of things I've been meaning to do but just haven't.  Foremost on this list is to finish writing and sending out thank you notes for my birthday, which is rapidly approaching its four-month anniversary.  I don't know why I keep putting it off.  Second and perhaps most pressing is going down to my old job to pick up my final check, which was supposed to be mailed to me but wasn't.  At least this one I know why I've been putting it off... I don't want to deal with those people anymore.  Third is going to get an estimate on having my front bumper repaired.  I bumped it on someting and it needs work, but as it isn't a major system I haven't done anything yet.  I keep giving myself the same answer on all three subjects: "maybe tomorrow."  Tomorrow never comes.

      (Sigh)  I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but my parents see fit to pass along all manner of odd things people send them via e-mail.  Normally I can just give it a once-over, exclaim something (Huh!) and move on with my life.    Since my mom's a little less computer savvy than I am though, I've been having some problems with my computer every time I open an attachment from them.  I've shown her how to use Ad-aware, and she has Norton Anti-virus installed, but this has happened more than once.  This time it took me 3 hours to re-download my drivers, and for some reason the system files got reset to how I had them over a year ago.  As far as I can tell, though, I didn't lose any data, other than having to re-install the Google toolbar.  It's not all bad.  In resetting my system files, somehow my internet history was also reset, and I rediscovered one of my former favorite  urlLink web-comics  in the "recent pages visited" bar in Internet Explorer.  It does make me wonder how long this information stays on the hard drive though, and who else might have access to it.  I haven't been to that particular website for over a year, but the address was still here somehow despite numerous cleansings with the Spider and Ad-aware programs.    I had intended to write this evening about the job interview I had today, but figuring out what was wrong with my computer took precedence.  Maybe I'll do that tomorrow.  KM

      Ever since I moved out of my parent's house, I haven't had very good TV reception.  I'm unwilling to pay for cable's needless expense, so for the most part I've just stopped watching TV.  The single exception, the one show I've never missed if I could help it, has been The Simpsons.  Social commentary is more palatable with a healthy dose of humor.  My Sunday evening ritual involves going over to my parents house for dinner, then coming back to my apartment and watching Fox's lineup.  In 16 years, I don't think I've missed an episode, unless you count the Tracey Ullman shorts.  And I don't.  I work pretty early in the morning, so staying up past 10pm isn't a great idea if I have to work the next day.  Fortunately, Fox has put the unwatchable "Simple Life" on right after the Simpsons and Arrested Development, a show I love but know better than to get too attached to.  It's probably a little too cerebral for the great unwashed.  Long story short, I have no problem getting to bed on time on Sundays anymore.  This probably isn't interesting to anyone but I promised myself I'd write something here at least once every couple of days.  As I practice hopefully I will improve.

      So... I'm sitting here at two minutes until five in the morning staring at the cathode ray tube, allowing my brain cells to die one by one and trying to figure out why the hell I'm sitting here in the first place.  "Here" in the grand scheme of things, not necessarily the geographical "here."  It's been quite some time since I used my computer for anything other than games or E-mail, but I've seen that little button on my  urlLink Google toolbar  for almost a year now and for some reason I never clicked it.  I'm not sure why, Lord knows I need some kind of outlet.  It may as well be the modern introspection of spilling your guts to the entire world.  I consider blogging to be an updated form of the diary (or journal, if you're too manly to keep something as frou-frou as a diary).  Kind of like what  urlLink Doogie Howser  kept on his computer, but broadcast for anyone with the time and inclination to see.  One of the  urlLink sites  I visit regularly is run by a guy who has always maintained that the only reason he still has a website is because it's cheaper than therapy.  We'll see.  In the days and weeks to come, I figure I'll either pour my little heart out here or else forget about it completely.  If I were a betting man, I'd put the long odds on the pouring.
