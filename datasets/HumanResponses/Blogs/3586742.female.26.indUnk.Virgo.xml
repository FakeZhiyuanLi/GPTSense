      And all you other readers. I have been pretty busy lately with my new job at  urlLink TechTarget  and therefore have not blogged since my new haircut. It's going really well so far (the job, not the haircut. Although, that's going well too), but I still have a lot to learn! I am also really tired right now so my creativeness is not flowing. We had another eventful night at Waterworks. If you haven't gone, go...it's quite an experience on a Sunday night.

      I finally got my haircut and colored today...but instead of going to Cliffy who I have been going to for six  years, I went to Felipo at Ardan Salon in Wellesley. I thought I would try someone new for a change and while I love my color and haircut (it's short, but it will grow!) I felt like I was cheating on my boyfriend of six years! I love Cliffy and will most likely go back to him next time. But it was a good change to try something new.

      Back in January I purchased a new  urlLink Samsung  phone from  urlLink AT&T . I have had a pretty good experience with AT&T and I really like my phone, but every person I talked to complained that my voice was extremely loud and muffled on the phone. I thought that maybe this was just their excuse to get off the phone with me, but I went into the AT&T store and asked if they had any complaints about the phone (yes I waited four months after I purchased to phone to ask about it). The AT&T rep said they had a bad batch of these phones that were sold, and apparently I bought one of them. Because it was still under warranty, AT&T send me a replacement phone for free. And guess what? My phone is loud and clear now, so no one has any excuse not to talk to me anymore.

      Well, the day has come...it crept up on me a lot quicker then I was expecting, so even though today is my last day here at  urlLink Y2M  it still hasn't hit me that I am leaving. And I definitely have a bittersweet feeling about it. I have been working here for close to two years and not only have I met some great people and made some amazing friends, but working here has been a phenomenal learning experience. I learned more about college newspapers then I ever thought I would know, but I have also grown as a person. And as Craig said, it's the people you work with that make the company. He couldn't be more right. My coworkers have been some of the greatest, most fun, hilarious, and hard-working people to work with. I have learned something from everyone here, whether it's about  urlLink Yerba Mate  (thanks Josh), one-liners from any movie and how to create and maintain relationships with anyone (thanks  urlLink Paul ), how to use Adobe (thanks  urlLink Matt ), how to pitch a client and sell nearly anything (thanks Tricia), and most importantly how to make a working environment productive and fun (thanks John and everyone else). So as hard as it will be to leave the company and the people I work with, I am moving on to new opportunities. I will begin working at  urlLink TechTarget  in Needham on June 23. I am excited for this new opportunity and will take everything I learned at Y2M and put it to good use at TechTarget. As I told Matt last night, just because I am leaving Y2M doesn't mean I am leaving my friends that I have made there. Thanks to everyone at Y2M and everyone who has been there for me in the last few months.

      Is it normal for a guy who is going away with a bunch of guys this weekend to want to buy a Man-Thong for the weekend? Okay, I'll give  urlLink Matt  a little credit here and say he is doing this just for novelty. I will also give him credit and say that his arms really will looked jacked in his new sleevless shirt.

      Tonight I'm taking a tennis lesson at Waltham Ahtletic Club. I haven't played tennis in years, and I mean years. They are offering beginner and advanced beginner lessons on Tuesday nights and each lesson is 1 1/2 hours, so I figured this would be a great way to get back into the game, do something productive, and hopefully meet some new people. Wish me luck!

      It went from phenomenal to rough. This morning I walked out to my car to leave only to realize that I had grabbed Jen's apartment keys, not my car keys. So I went back inside, chatted with  urlLink Jen  for a few minutes and then went back out to my car only to realize that I had put down Jen's keys, but didn't grab my car keys. I went back inside for a final time and grabbed the right keys. Little slow today.

      My alarm went off around 9 on Sunday morning and since Kelly and I went to bed around 3:30, it wasn't a pretty picture when I opened my eyes. However, it was a gorgeous day out so we rallied to head down to  urlLink Manchester, MA . This is where my mom grew up and her brother Jimmy still lives in the same house they grew up in. So he offered me his car that has a pass to Singing Beach. We arrived there around 11, said a quick hello to my Aunt, Uncle, my 2 cousins, and their dog Taz and then headed down to the beach. It was a perfect beach day...it was cool enough that we didn't even have to go in the 54 degree water! We basked in the sun until about 3 (remind me next time to wear sunscreen), packed up our things, switched cars and headed back towards the city.  When I got back to the apartment Rich, Marcus, Pete, and Justin were upstairs on their porch sitting in the sun, drinking coronas, and listening to the Beastie Boys. I figured there really wasn't any better way to spend the rest of the afternoon so I made myself a sangria (cheap sangria...it's pretty good. Try it. Red wine and orange soda) and hung out upstairs for a while. The guys were talking about heading to  urlLink Waterworks  and since this had come up earlier in discussion with one of my friends I figured I would tag along. Rich, Marcus, and Pete headed in while Justin, Charlene, and I went to pick up Jen in Southie. We finally arrived at Waterworks only to pay a $20 cover. The place was pretty empty when we first arrived and it was chilly out. But we kept the beers flowing and gradually more people showed up. Charlene and Justin left and I stayed with the other guys. I ended up running into some guys I went to high school with, but I think the highlight of the night was when we crashed the  urlLink Patriots  party. Apparently they had just received their  urlLink Super Bowl Champ rings  (talk about bling bling!) so they had rented out a tent for the evening. Marcus works for ESPN so he finagled us into the party. We went up to the bar to order some drinks (it is important to note here that the ONLY person out of us 4 who had cash on them was Pete. Not a good thing since the bar only accepted cash, no plastic) but when we went to pay the bartender informed us it was open bar. So here we are at a party that we just crashed, hanging out with Willie McGinest, Richard Seymour, Lonie Paxton, and Joe Andruzzi, and drinking free drinks for the rest of the night! The party ended around 1:30 and we headed back to Rich's car and headed home. For my first experience at Waterworks, I must say, it was a pretty good one. Rough day at work on Monday though.

      Great weekend! And I'm definitely paying for it now. I didn't intend on going out all 3 nights (and yes, by all 3 nights that does include Sunday), but you know, being a social butterfly like myself, well sometimes you just can't help it! Friday night Justin and I went to meet Topher and his friends at Ned Devine's. Saturday afternoon I finally washed my car, sat out in the sun, relaxed a bit and then got ready to go out, yet again! This time the destination was Sanctuary with Alyssa, Amy, and Kelly. We met up with crazy Jay who was in town visiting from Florida, Kelly's brother and his friends, Pete, Linda, Derek...basically all the cool people. That was my first time at Sanctuary and I actually enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going back there. Their menu looked pretty decent as well, so I would like to try it for dinner sometime. Kelly stayed over at the apartment Saturday night so we could wake up bright and early and head to Manchester-By-the-Sea for some sun-bathing on Singing Beach! You know, Sunday was such a phenomenal day that I think it deserves it's own post!

      If you are a sox fan like myself, then you will enjoy this  urlLink contest . Guess how many hits and runs the sox and their opponents will have each week and you could win a pair of Red Sox tickets. The catch...if you win, you have to bring me! Good luck!

      We originally had a 90 minute  urlLink company  meeting scheduled today for 3:30, but we just received an email from Fees stating that the meeting has been rescheduled for Wednesday at lunchtime. Hmmm...does this mean I can now leave a little bit early today?

      It is a beautiful day today here in Boston...sunny and not a cloud in the sky, yet the nation is mourning over two icons. Ronald Reagan passed away Sunday, June 5 at the age of 93. There has been an extended amount of remembrance this week covered by all media outlets, therefore I am going to just say that Reagan was the first leader I knew growing up and I will always remember him as a great historic icon. "He cultivated an image as an outsider, a horse-riding, wood-chopping Westerner who talked common sense in the salons of the East. But that image, like many others in the Reagan repertoire, was skillfully crafted. Mr. Reagan often called upon the dramatic arts, grafting them onto the political arts and earning for himself a reputation as the "Great Communicator" of American politics."  Ray Charles, the legend of soul, passed away yesterday at the age of 73. He touched the lives of many listeners beginning in the 1950s, however my greatest remembrance was his rendition of "America the Beautiful" that played across the nation after Sept. 11, 2001, a time when the nation itself was mourning. "Mr. Charles had the ability to make an age-old patriotic standard sound fresh and all his own indicates the phenomenal strength and character of his voice. That voice -- an earthy, powerful baritone equally adept at shriek, croon, or shout -- had a command of seemingly all American popular music."  A moment of silence for both.

      All day I wasn't sure that I wanted to go out tonight partly because I haven't been feeling well all week and partly because of the gloomy day. Well, I have changed my mind! I have kicked into high gear and I am ready for a few socials. The sun is out and there is only a half hour left in the day. I am going with some coworkers to meet Dana and Pauly (and hopefully some others) at the Rattlesnake on Boylston. After that...who knows. We shall see where the night takes me!

      It's a pretty blah day out there today. After we hit the record high yesterday a huge thunderstorm came through and cooled things off pretty quickly, but left the clouds in the sky and the temp in the 60s. I was upstairs last night at Rich's apartment watching the sox game with Rich and Pete (and  urlLink Jen  for a little bit!) and they had the AC pumping and the fan on. The game went into rain delay and it cooled off drastically. Unfortunately I couldn't stay up to watch the end of the game, I was too sleepy! I took some tylenol PM and went to bed. I slept like a rock, however somehow woke up even more tired this morning. Go figure. Is it Friday yet?

      Nomar is making his  urlLink season debut  tonight with the sox. Knowing this is getting me through the last half hour of the day.

       urlLink This video  is going back to a glorious April day that was spent in the luxury box at the Sox vs. Tampa Bay game. Matt and I skipped out of work early to meet  urlLink Melissa  (Matt's girlfriend) at Fenway to catch the 1 p.m. makeup game. Bellhorn hit a foul ball towards our box (well, I wish it were our box) that ricocheted off the window and rolled down right behind Matt. As Matt reached for the ball he nailed Melissa in the head, nice boyfriend. You know, I always said that if I were on TV at a sporting event I wouldn't be one of those dorks that points at the TV and waves instead of waving to the camera. Well, as you can see here, clearly I was one of those dorks (please keep your comments to yourself).  urlLink GO SOX!

      Yesterday marked the start of the annual  urlLink Scooper Bowl , an event hosted by the Jimmy Fund. For $7 you can eat all the ice cream you want in every imaginable flavor possible (including Cotton Candy, not so good). Boston is approaching a record high today of 94 degrees, so what a better way to cool off then eat lots and lots of ice cream. Josh,  urlLink Paul , Matt, Tom, Megan, and I headed outside for a little taste testing. Since our office overlooks City Hall Plaza we didn't have far to travel. Tom held the record for trying the most flavors, I only tried 3 1/2 after feeling extremely full and loaded up with sugar...no afternoon coffee for me.

      For a while now I have been wanting to set up a blog, and now thanks to  urlLink Matt Smith  I finally have! I have wanted a blog for a couple of reasons. The first is because I love to write and this gives me an opportunity to be creative with my writing (someday I will write that book Ame!). And the second is to let all you nosey people out there know what I am doing in my oh-so-exciting life! Stay tuned for more blogs from the mind of me!

      The DNC is in town this week and there has been a lot of events, celebrity sightings, and traffic detours. While I have yet to run into anyone famous (tough to do when you live and work outside of the city) I have enjoyed the minimal amount of traffic on the roads and have so far attended one event with another on the schedule for tonight. Tuesday night I went with Dana and some of my old coworkers to see the Black Eyed Peas at the  urlLink Avalon &nbsp;on Landsdown Street. They didn't go on until midnight, but put on a phenomenal show with a surprise guest, none other then P. Diddy's butler Farnsworth Bentley, who appeared during their last song "Where Is the Love." Tonight's destination: The Roxy to see Maroon 5 and LL Cool J. Both events were hosted by  urlLink Rock the Vote .
