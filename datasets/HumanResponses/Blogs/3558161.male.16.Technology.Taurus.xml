      Stumbling down These lonely roads Searching around Nowhere to go  Groping the night Nothing to hold Everything's lifeless Nowhere to go  Fighting the shadows Abandoned and tied Descend the ladder To where darkness thrives.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  A fallen soldier  Still fights for his life  He's just getting colder  He's losing the fight.  It's all just a game  I know what it's like.  Lift you up  Held above to see all  This glorious city  Is going to fall.  These blissful waters  Will be awoken to fear  Kick in the door  Seeking your answers  When there are none to be found  Take my hand  And see where I lead  You suffocate the world  And act a breath of air  I fight for reform  And stand as stone.   I won't miss a beat  'Cause I never, never have before.

      Who will be there? I sure will.  This isn't being fabricated into something it's not, there's always going to be something standing up, challenging what I am capable of.  And I will meet it full force, never wavering, never faltering, never stopping, slowing or stalling.  And if you read this, and you wonder what the challenge is,  You'll probably soon find out.  :)  >>>  Try.

      Always must be something to butt heads.  A new challenge is always rising to the occasion.  So would you like to test this?  Would you like to see what I can take?    I can handle anything.

       In the land of dirt and plaster Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids Losing ground and falling faster Into a life that no one should have to live  We are the people that you hate We are the bastards that you created (the fucking bastards that you created) A generation with no place A generation of all your sons and daughters  Behind the fake family image Behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads Inside the cage that we've been given I see an image of the future that we don't have  And what did you expect ... a perfect child? Raised by tv sets ... abandoned every mile We never get respect ... never a fair trial  No one gives a shit ... as long as we smile

      I'm working on a long CD. 80 Minutes to be exact, and I'm still formulating what to put on it. You know what I mean if you're reading this and you understand.  Also, I find it funny that not caring is a crime, but caring is as well. Can't try to help, but if you shy away and give someone space, then you never cared at all.  Funny how these things work...  Can you say 'Lose-Lose situation'?   Otherwise, things are going amazingly, amazingly good. I'm going to be driving a lot, Mom and Dad are taking me out, and then I'll have my license... and  THEN , you and I will be able to get away.

      Please hold. I'm writing a book.   No, really. But you won't get to see it, only one of you.    How can you stand to attempt this This severing? Is it Romeo and Juliet? Do you think we'll give up? Do you think true love Can be torn like this? Do you think I'm the same? Am I just another lie?  Let me tell you now That I'm not even close I'm disgusted By those who judge me And I pity them   Pity is hate.    ES - I Love You

      For once, things are going well, and I actually don't have any feeling that they're going to start going bad. This is something I have _NEVER_ experienced before.  I'm wondering what the future holds  And I'm wondering who, if anyone reads this. I've given the link, but I'm sure it's been long lost and long forgotten. After all, these are just the ramblings of Alex Arsenault.  Not to say this negatively, but it seems people have always thought of me as a lesser form of a human, when in reality, they don't know that I'm quite the opposite.  And when they get a chance to figure that out, they don't.  Because they don't want to know!  :P Don't worry, I'm in a good mood still, I don't give a fuck who reads this  or  what they think. Well... unless it's positive of course. I never get comments :'(

      This layered storm Raging in the path it wants Leaves everything And nothing behind Unconditionally Yet, chooses only the most beautiful of neighborhoods To demolish.  Do you truly feel  no  remorse?  Do you ever feel guilty for what you've done? For what you're doing? Can you really push through that blindly, not caring that so many know who you are?  When you read this, are you reading because you  care ?  Are you reading this because you want to know if you still have sway? Pull? Power?  Sadly mistaken. Mind games have not been played on anyone's part but yours.  Believe what you want, and force others' hands, not mine.  For this force is stronger than you will  ever  be.  EVER.    These are not riddles. These are statements. Riddles ask questions, and there are none to be asked but 'Why do you do this?'    For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight  I'd scream this song Right in your face if you were here  And I won't Miss a beat 'Cause I never Never have before   Strong arms will turn weak Those eyes will fade; they already are. Dulling into gray, into darkness Giving in to what thrives  You feed carelessly Ever wonder If you've met a wall You can't break through?  That you can't knock down? Ever wonder if there is a mind that does not waver? That this individual can  fight ? Ever wonder if you'd encounter a battle that you can't win? A battle that uses no physical might?   You ruin the best.

      It's when dark things hide in the shadows while I'm walking home alone And jump out of the shrubbery and trees And overtake me And they smother me And there's nothing else to look at, because they're on top of me Beating my face  Until the force comes back.  Sometimes caffeine speeds that up.    ::sigh::... I am so sorry, #35

      See, for those of you who read this, I intensely wonder how many of you understand. Who I've given this to, I probably trust, quite a bit. That right now, isn't the important part.  How do you tell people you're frustrated with them, when they won't listen?  When they 'have no flaws'?  How do you show them that as much as they don't want to believe it, they do the things they do?  How much of a crime is it, to protect your friends?  How much of a crime is it to possibly sacrafice one for another?  Is it a crime to not want to hurt people?  I will not be sent on guilt trips. This is one situation, that with  everyone  I have to be overly-cautious. I have to be hard and unmoving, unchanging, because I know who I am, and I am not going to be blamed for doing what I thought was right, for feeling what I was feeling. These days, people get   pissed   at you, for speaking your mind. Maybe the conversation was to come? Maybe I was getting to it. None of that matters.  What matters is that I did what I needed to, and there's much more to come. Everyone has flaws, but when you're stuck in between many of them, it builds up. I'm cleaning skeletons out, and I don't know who's staying and who's going. It all depends...  TOIWLGO: Thank you. For allowing me to show someone reality. Mike: I am sorry. That may sound meaningless, but I am.

      I don't know why, but I feel like I've been dropped, a helpless, angered, weak animal, in a dark room. No air, no water or food, and no light. And everyone gathers around and looks in. And they scream things I can't hear, because I'm deaf, too. They scream that I need to find my way out, even though they have the keys. They scream that it's my fault, even though it's theirs. They scream that There's nothing they can do, even though they have the world in their hands. And I'm left to die. They watch for a while, and eventually get bored of watching me stumble, blind and deaf, starving, and they find better things to do. I was tricked into this box with a wink and a tantalizing kiss.  I was tricked into this box by a wry smile and a look in the eye that lets you know you're wanted and loved.  I was tricked into this box, and like always, I'm left to die. And every time I fight myself out, without anyone else, silently battling away at the thick walls that are my problems.  And the box is closing in. And this time the walls are thicker. And the ones I thought would be there left, and they betrayed me.  Will I finally have some help now? And if I do, will I be dropped back in the box after I'm bailed out for the first time?  What does tomorrow bring? What will you say and  mean ?  Will you read this and understand me?  Will you unlock me?

      Faith isn't faith anymore. It all too often leaves the best of us Sitting in the wet dark, alone, With everything we ever had, shattered, Cradled in our feeble hands.  These days it's quicker There's little to no wait False happiness is only temporary Before it's burned to the ground. We, collectively have encountered this new phenomenon That bars us from the very hopes and aspirations that keep us going. This is the strongest weight imaginable Plummeting from the top of the Twin Towers Only to fall on our shoulders.  It becomes a contest of who can catch that weight without collapsing, And that ability is not judged by physical strength. I long for the day that those who distribute pain so readily, so generously Will get a heaping spoonful of what we have been feeling For all eternity.  I ponder my possibilities Because this is not a game anymore You have to fight to live, through constant discomfort.   When wild animals are backed into corners, How do they respond?

      This suffocating blanket has  Fallen over me again It's not letting up Draped over Letting down slowly As the air I need to live rushes  Out from under it, as it does not want to be caught Like I will soon be. This blanket is so heavy No strength can lift it It's all closing in And I know what you think That this is where I give up But you will soon find out That I'm just getting started And if there's one thing that can get me Out of this place It's not anyone But me. I don't  need  anyone. And I don't  need  anything. And I'll  NEVER  stop fighting.  And the person that has betrayed me the most, that has changed the most, that hates "not being able to kick someone's ass", if you want to start with me, I'll knock your teeth down your  fucking  throat. I promise.  To the rest of you, that matter to me the very most: You will never know how much you affect me, in a positive way. CC, ME, AO, ES.

       You're cynical and beautiful You always make a scene You're monochrome delirious You're nothing that you seem I'm drowning in your vanity Your laugh is a disease You're dirty and you're sweet You know you're everything to me  I love good music. Symbolic, meaningful. Things that you can listen to and get goosebumps because you know what it resembles, what it reminds you of. Songs and music are one of the biggest triggers of memory, too. When you break up with someone, I guarantee you'll hate to listen to "your song" that you had with "them". Either that, or you'll cry when you hear it :)  Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  I wanna kick at the machine That made you piss away your dreams And tear at your defenses Till there's nothing there but me You're angry when you're beautiful Your love is such a tease I'm drowning in your dizzy noise I wanna   feel   you   scream.     Good music.. is what keeps much of us  going  in life. It's one of the most important things to some of us.   Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  Everything you are Whatever ever you want Whatever ever you want Whatever ever you want           Dizzy - Goo Goo Dolls

      Hmm... You know, I've been wondering a lot lately as to what it is exactly that keeps me going. I've always had this unnatural urge, feeling, whatever you want to call it, that keeps me from quitting... I can't explain it. When I'm feeling so depressed that I can't get ANY sadder, or when I just want to give up, when I'm not thinking rationally, there's always  something  there that keeps me just happy enough, makes me think optimistically, makes me  want  to go on, makes me think clearly again. It brings good 'ol common sense back, and leaves me feeling... Better. And I don't know what it is. It's nothing that's being affected from the outside. It's all in me, but I have no idea what it is that drives me. It keeps me alive, breathing, healthy, and happy. It keeps that smile on my face, and it keeps my momentum up. It amazes and impresses me quite often. I must have some purpose... What does fate have in store for me?

      So this is life. We move through, weaving our webs with the dark threads that are our decisions. Our delicate work that we are always attempting to perfect, to make just right, is all too often wrecked by a careless hand, swept away as if it's something that's easy to recreate. And it's common. That sweeping hand, that delicate piece of work, are our worst nightmare and our greatest accomplishment. It's always being destroyed and rebuilt, and only the strongest survive. Too often do I find myself on a clear night, looking up into the sky, at the stars, and wishing They were with me, that I could hold Them, that They could experience with me what I love, and to understand the most simple but most powerful of emotions. But that's where the sweeping hand comes in, that wrecks that thought, that emotion, that drains you of your energy, until you have nothing left but the remnants of your masterpiece.

      6/6/04 8:58 pm  This was actually written at the above time, on my Palm Pilot. I was unable to access the internet, so I didn't get to upload it until the time the actual blog posted for me. :)  I suppose, lately, or maybe all my life, I've been trying to find myself, and help myself, which I seem to have been unable to do, even though I seem to be able to effortlessly solve other's problems, or help them. I confuse even myself sometimes. I wonder why I look at things the way I do, why I know things are going to happen, what fate has to do with my life, and what it affects, what it's going to hand me next. Its frustrating, too. I've tried and tried to do things, but, they just seem to all melt down into the same failure. I don't even know exactly what it is that I'm doing wrong, or what's causing it. I've been told that there is sonmething that I need to change that I haven't, and they (the person) won't tell me what it is. I don't know where to start. There is no beginning. I suppose it stems from my childhood. I had and have... sort of, two loving parents. My Dad has always been there for me. He's always been the responsible one, and he's always been my favorite of the two. They (my parents) divorced for the first time (of two times) when I was four, and Dad moved away to Laconia. He came to see me all the time, but when he wasn't there it felt like he never was. My Mom was always crying at this table we had in the kitchen. There was always a box of Golden Graham cereal on the table, and a phone, and a phone book, and she's just put her elbows up there, near the window, and cry every night. I was four, and this tore me apart. Every night, after having my Golden Grahams for dinner, I comforted my mother before going to bed early. I'd get into my bed, which was a crib with the sides taken off, and I'd pull out the pictures I had of my Dad under my pillow. One was just him, and one was he and I. There was smiling in all of them. I'd stare at those two pictures, endlessly looking them over, and I'd cry myself to sleep. I had nightmares all the time those days, too. The same one every time. I had this closet in my room, that I shared with my Mother, and it was always very dark in there, light could never get in, even if the door was open. All these red skeletons would come out and the "leader" would pick me up, and kiss me. Then I'd wake up. My parents got together, and I'd say that time poeriod was the best of my life. When they got back together I was five, and when I turned six my Mom was pregnant with my sister. We moved back to Concord to the house I'm in now. After Sam was born and old enough to live somewhat on her own, with care from Dad and no waking up in the night and crying, Mom was never home. She was always out, blowing all her money on god-knows-what, partying, hanging out with friends, etc. Dad and I would always sit at home, waiting for her to get back, which as rarely before I went to bed. We'd have "hang out nights" and watch movies and talk, make food, and that was truly the time we got to bond the most. Basically, after they divorced for the second time, when I was 12, Mom started doing drugs, quite a bit. It got bad over the years, and she lost her job, and all her severance pay went not to bills, but to cocaine and ecstasy. These days, I'm lucky if I see her two days a month. My sister is heartbroken. She's 9, and she needs a mother. My Mom is never on time to get us, which shows she doesn't really care that much. We're disposable, I guess. Sucks, huh? The only thing I've ever really had trouble with is my Dad expecting a lot of me and girls. I don't know why, but things with women just haven't worked out, until somewhat lately. Even then, my past experiences with being hurt, again and again, have broken me. I barely trust anything anymore. I never have as much trust and belief as I should. I have hope, always, but I never have the faith that I should. I'm always worrying. When it comes to a lot being expected of me, it not only boils down to myself being exposed to a lot at such a young age (my Mom with drugs, and the fact that she was a lesbian (this I found out when I was 13)), a lot is still expected of me sometimes. My Dad sometimes... well.. often has no patience with anything. He asks me to get good grades, when I don't, and then I finally do, and everything's better. Then that's expected of me, and it's not good enough anymore. I haven't ever really been able to truly be a kid, and just run amok like kids should. I understand safety, but how safe can you be. Is it protecting your child when you run through a list of reasons in your head that you could tell them so they can't go somewhere? That's frustrating. My dad has never taken me out driving, and I'm in driver's ed. How's that? I bet I won't get to drive his car, either, even though we have three at the house. It's things like this that frustrate me. Also, sometimes my wireless router at the house will fuck up, and he won't be able to get online (and I won't either). When this happens, he not only flips out at me, but he has no patience. He expects me to be able to snap my fingers, shake my ass, and have the router snap back to life and online again. I work as hard and as fast as I can to fix it, but christ, what does he expect? I'm still 16. I just have never felt as free as I should be. Any freedom I do have is restricted. Computer: restricted. If I go over someone's house a lot, and I want to go, it's "you just went there yesterday, or last week". Whether these instances are far apart or close together, they build up on me. I find myself being mad for no reason. Just angry, and I am in a fighting mood. And I lock all that in. I'm in a situation right now, with someone that knows who they are... :) And she is... very special to me. I've never been able to connect with someone like I have with her, before. I'm left in aweevery day, and I don't even know how I could've ended up having a chance with someone like her. It seems too good to be true, and that's why the paranoia kicks in. I've never, and I really want to emphasize the  N E V E R , liked someone, and had them like me just that much back. I've never met someone emotionally capable of meeting me on that level, or someone that even cared that much for me. It was (and may still be) me always writing the notes, saying I Love You, wanting to spend time with the person, and... That hurts. To know, for once, that someone actually wants to BE with ME, that they love me BACK, that they want ME, is a completely different feeling, and it's something I've never truly had. I just, sometimes, feel like people don't really care about me or what happens to me. With this someone of mine, though, I understand she's worried just as much as I am. I just hope she knows I'm not fucking with her head. I would never, not with her situation, or with anyone else. I just wish things would work our for me, for once. And I hope I can realize what's going on, and what I need to be truly happy. Hopefully I'll find it. Or maybe fate will bring it (or has brought it) to me. Patience is a virtue.  And to my love: You can take me on your roller coaster, and whisper me your secrets. I still won't let go. Even if you try to shake me off. :) I Love You.  Je t'adore, mon petit chou. (Did I get that right?)  ::sigh:: okay, that was a lot to write. Time to log OUT!

       You cannot quit me so quickly   Is no hope in you for me   No corner you could squeeze me   But I got all the time for you, love      The Space Between   The tears we cry   Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more   The Space Between   The wicked lies we tell   And hope to keep safe from the pain      But will I hold you again?   These fickle, fuddled words confuse me   Like 'Will it rain today?'   Waste the hours with talking, talking   These twisted games we're playing    --------------------     Look at us spinning out in   The madness of a roller coaster   You know you went off like a devil   In a church in the middle of a crowded room   All we can do, my love   Is hope we don't take this ship down      The Space Between   Where you're smiling high   Is where you'll find me if I get to go   The Space Between   The bullets in our firefight   Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you   The rain that falls   Splash in your heart   Ran like sadness down the window into your room   The Space Between   Our wicked lies   Is where we hope to keep safe from pain      Take my hand    'Cause we're walking out of here

Is that so, you sweet, innocent, egotistical fuck?               And the same to you, sweetheart. You are beyond shallow. I've never been more disgusted with anything or anyone in my life. I wonder why people like you exist. Maybe to teach me lessons, that even those who say they love you the most are nothing more than meaningless pieces of trash that shouldn't be talking to me at all. So let's leave it at that. Regarding the "geek" comment, I hope I come to the gas station  you're  working at when you grow up, buddy. Then you can pump my brand new BMW full of the  expensive  gas. And I just might tip you, too, if you do a good job.               And you play  football ? What an accomplishment. How do you know how tall I am? Measure me lately? Hah.                And when it comes to being a queer, buddy, you take the cake. That I'm sure of.                What about 'being serious all the time and kinda immature'? Hmm... sounds like an oxymoron to me. Sounds like if you remove the 'oxy' it leaves  you  the moron.               'and shit'... Sounds like he was going somewhere with that one. Simple minds can't process much of anything if they're wasted on simple head-banging action (football). I hope you're proud of yourself. You were most definitely a mistake.               You need to drag your fat ass out of your egotistical state of mind and learn that you mean absolutely nothing to this world. The most you put out is a shadow of a rat shit. And maybe I shouldn't even give you  that  much credit.                I know what love is. I'm in it.               And you've had SEX?! Who the fuck would be crazy enough to let a slimy, sweaty fat monster like you inside of them? That's some serious issues that this girl needs to work out, and fast.              Tideftbll74 :    and the kids crazy            Umm... Yes, I am. And that means don't fuck with me, and   you   stop talking shit. Or I'll fucking kill you. Because I am crazy. And when it comes to  you , as much as it wouldn't be worth going to jail, the satisfaction is too great to deny.             Tideftbll74 :   kids phyco          We've already covered this, haven't we bud? And I think you mean 'psycho'.           Well, I think that pretty much covers it. I'm out for the night. Have fun reading this.           Lots of love, to my sweet sweet darling with your "beautiful" eyes, you "open", "innocent", "nice" guy.

      You're sick and quiet  Living your double life  Led by your double standards  Do you have anything inside?    You're hollow and content  Deep down inside  Give up nothing  So how can you feel so alive?    How can you cry  When you turn your back  On everything you ever had,  Stepping on trust and loyalty    Always falling  You're never there  And you never were  You squirm when cornered    Because you know you're wrong.

      How do I always know before these things happen? How can I tell that 'this time is the worst of them all'??? &nbsp; All I can do now, is thank my   true   friends. &nbsp; Christine Cate being one of them. She's proven it. &nbsp; I wrote this before I found this all out. &nbsp; -------------------- &nbsp;   The End       &nbsp;   Fuck   you and your shallowness Break open  my  smile  , See what's really inside. It's all I have left.   Everything I ever had Is stabbing my back Spitting in my face Watching me drop to my knees Letting me cry Laughing at me.   Everything I ever wanted And everything I ever   loved   Is everything I've always hated And everything I ever fought against.   Every promise Has been broken Every ethic Has been torn Every moral Has been soiled All for a shallow dream.   I'm sorry I can't be just like him I'm sorry that I wasn't the best rebound for you. I'm sorry I don't have the looks you need I'm sorry I'm not good enough.   But when it comes down To brass tacks, I know for a fact What your future lacks.  You lack sense You lack will You underestimate And you take for granted.   You don't have me Nearly like you think you do. And you make me   sick   to my stomach With your hypocriticism.  And your disgusting ways.  I finally found out What I never thought to be true. And I never broke   one   fucking promise I made to you. I always told you it'd be you instead of me  And I was right.   March 10th was the day the plan of my ultimate downfall was enacted.   March 10th is a bad day.   I will remember this, for the rest of my life. Forever.   &nbsp; Just leave me the   fuck   alone.

      Break my smile open Take a look inside I'll open up for you I'll do anything for you  Never before Did I think dreams came true I never dreamt Of someone like you  The aching truths of the past Have all washed away Leaving us And no one else  When you're in my arms Nothing else matters When I have you I have it all, baby.  You fill my empty streets You brighten my darkest corners With your eyes and your smile. I want to kiss you just one more time.  Forever and always, Alex

      My stomach is ripping itself apart, clenching itself into fists that won't let go, won't loosen. My heart feels like it's just falling apart at the seams, all the threads that hold me together are steadily coming undone, and there's nothing I can do about it. It's not like something's missing, it's like everything's missing, but it shouldn't be. I feel like I'm being tricked into beliving I have things I don't, and that's because someone has taken them from me. It feels like I'm not worth anything, that no one needs me, that no one cares. I feel despair, and pity, and carelessness. I feel people pulling away, and I feel like I'm losing friends. I feel like I'm dragging my feet, and as much as I don't want to be, I'm at a standstill in my life, and none of it is in my hands. None of it is under my control, but I'm expected to get out of it. I expect from myself that I should get out of it. My stomach's clenched fists are readying themselves to swing aimlessly, at anything standing in my way. I have an anger that I can't subside, that I can't absorb, that I can't vent. I can't bike it out, I can't read, play, work it out. I can't think it out, and I can't love it out. Because it's out of my control. And not only that, but it's not going to change at all. I feel lost, and scared. And I'm sick of this feeling. I want the truth, and I want it to be proven to me.   Everything's on fire, and everything's falling. Fast. Too fast. It seemed just a minute ago that the birds were chirping, and the sky was an endless blue abyss, waiting to swallow you up with the sun, and take you on a wild ride of happiness, true happiness. It used to be a sun that gave you everything you ever wanted, and more. And then it took off its mask.  The sky darkened, with unnatural speed. The clouds hastily moved in, waiting to strike at anything they could reach. All I can do is run, because there's nothing to fight. There's nothing to fix, and there's nothing to ponder or decide. There's no formalities or rules, except just one: It's not going to go how you want it to.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  He fell to his knees Begging for life They spit in his face And pushed him down.  Tears staining the dirt Drawing feebly in the dust With one shaking hand And all is lost.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  And when I read back, when I look at past feelings and past thoughts and emotions  It makes me hurt that much harder.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  I'm so scared that I'll never Get put back together  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  ::Sits back and thinks for a moment, then after a while nods and says 'Hmm' to himself::  I think I'll go throw up now.

      Storm-fed waters rage inside me A race to the end of time to prove them wrong. Angered winds build inside me The waters continue,  raging on . Until the night that all is calm. The night I've wanted for so long.

      Instinct, worry, that feeling in your stomach when you know something's wrong. Let's call it 'X'.  Dear X,  Your silence is  deafening  Your bluntness cuts  deep . Your darkness all encompassing And Your breath suffocating.   Oh, X,  When you come I know something's wrong When you knock at my door I know it's you. And yet, I  thank  you for your forewarnings.    Stay the fuck away,  ...  Stay the fuck away,   or I'll kill you.

      Worthlessness -- the blunt knife pressing into the back of your neck, the times in life when you drown in your own endless tears. Those are times when no one you want, no one you need cares. No one is there to comfort a crumbling soul. When everyone forms their social-circle and watches you burn from within, watches you suffer. And no matter how ample the cries for help, they refuse to come to the rescue. Is there ever anyone there?  If you're crying yourself to sleep, I'll cry myself to sleep with you.  If you're hurt, I'll hold you until you're better, and then even more.  I Love You more than anything. Forever.  ===============  Have you ever wanted to kill someone  else's  parents?

      The latest culture has bred a twisted-logic that has made what has been wrong for years seem right to some. Those infected with this logic variant seem to blindly swing their fists at anything that comes close enough for them to touch. And then there are the invincible. Those untouchable by anyone, because they're big, and they're strong.    Note: Don't fuck with me, I'm crazy.   So speaking of these 'big and strong' individuals, some choosing to fight with fists, and some even with words, these truly shallow beings that are mocking depth are the ones that are my targets.  To truly hate this breed of human, the shallow and invincible, the false smiles and lies and stories they tell, and the ones that attempt to interfere, will fall first.  Those who ruin others' lives, those who hurt others, tell great tales and pretend they know just how you feel, that they are in the same position and always will be, that they are just like you, they will fall first.   To enter a domain that is sacred, to interfere, will be the death of you.  CG

       The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, becuase words diminish them--words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.  I've made the brutal mistake of investing all of myself into something that has decided to not work out for myself. I've learned my lesson, tenfold.   I suppose all that's left to say is that there's plenty more fish in the sea.

      Well, I've finally cleared up all that needs to be cleared up.  I have found myself, and found everyone else out.  And I think that I can be content with how things are now, 'other people-wise', and very happy continuing on, although things didn't end up going my way. Life will leave you with your head in your hands all too often. But to dwell on the worst for so long is long enough, and it's most definitely time for me to move on and see what else is out there, even if it means giving up one of the used-to-be greatest things I had.  I won't be online often, I'm surprised I found the time to update.  I extend my thanks to a few people:  Justin Christine Cate And myself, for putting everything into perspective and into the back of my head for a while, so I can enjoy what I do have. I suppose that, more than anything, I'm happy I'm not bound into something that would eventually ruin me anyways.  I sincerely hope the happiest for you and your newfound happiness.   They call me Mr. Marlboro.     It will all work out in the end, for me, at least.
