      Today there was an earthquake in Northern Morocco. According to CNN there were at least 564 dead as of Tuesday Morning. My family is ok I assume, they live a few hundred miles south of the epicenter. The quake occured at about 2:28 a.m. with a magnitude of 6.5. The people who died were peasants living mud huts in rural villages near the city of Al-Houceima.  Life is strange. I wonder why I have been spared the many tragedies that occur daily. It only reaffirms my desire to live my life to the fullest.

      I finally have this blog looking somewhat decent and with comment abilities too. Obviously I'm a newbie. Anyway, David Martinez said my first entry was boring. Now, YOU can tell me how boring it is, just click on the "Comment" button... Henceforth, I will try to keep my posts interesting or not post at all. Some possible future topics are: Illegal Immigrants, Favorite Trance DJ's, Casablanca, Moroccan Fossils, Valentines, Theological impressions, Dating, Keith Green, Favorite Fruits, How to make the best tasting tacos and guacamole.

      I just got home from work. I made a song on my computer with Reason 2.5 (the 20 minute Demo version). It's a musically limited song, just a cool and heavy house/break beat with a repetetive acidic bass line in C minor. I like it. It sounds tight. The 2 bar loop still plays in the background, and it will continue to play until I press the (Quit) button reminding me that I could only play for 20 minutes. Nobody will have ever heard my song. (Unless Esteban gets home soon).  At least I got to practice my guitar and play along to the infectious beat. Eventually, I'll buy the software. Maybe when 3.0 comes out. I sense that now is not the time. I need to save my money, prioritize, whatever.  This is my first web-log ever. The concept is still pretty amazing to me. Somewhat mysterious... yet exciting.  - Tony  "For me, to live is Christ and to die is gain." - Paul

       I stood near a house on a street that was a mix between Lark and Bruce Ave. I heard screams and saw two Mexican young ladies who were running frantically. I intuitively knew that they were trying to escape a man who was bent on killing them. I told them to come with me and led them behind the house. By now the house was my Grandfather's old house  on Bruce. The house was really only a dilapidated frame, a suggestion of what once was and obviously not a good hiding place so I led the two girls to the neighbor's lot (the Denmans).  I could hear the fury of the guys chasing her. Their leader was an overweight Mexican "Cholo" who was carrying a huge black shotgun. Yelling and cursing, he let off some rounds which were overwhelmingly loud. I tried to dial 911 on my cell phone but it wouldn't work. I then tried adding a one and dialed 1-911, but that didn't work either. I looked up and saw the fat gangster cross the street towards our lot. They were on the other side of the house so I told the girls to hurry up and run to the front door neighbor's without being seen. Amazingly, they ran across and the fat Mexican didn't see them.  At this point a white lady was walking by and she called 911. Rick Trevino (an older friend of mine) also showed up and called the police. Both of their phones worked fine whereupon Rick explained that my phone needed a special code in order to work with the emergency number.  Rick then helped me grab my things (I only specifically remember my guitar) and we left my grandfather's house at which point the dream was over.

      I dreamt that Buttons was growing weak. He was very skinny and could not eat. I put a mouse in his vivarium and Buttons attacked but wasn't able to suffocate the mouse as he normally does. Then, Buttons became only head and tail, no body inbetween. He looked like a fat, fin-less fish. ..... In real life, Buttons is about 5 feet long and 2.5 inches thick (thicker when recently fed). He is a ball python that my sister adopted then gave me for my birthday. I feed him a rat about once a month. My snake is beautiful but most people don't think so. I don't care, I love seeing people's reactions when they see my snake... I don't know why, but most people are afraid.  For example, this past Sunday, I was playing Guitar in the front yard with Esteban and we saw a Cholo ride up in a truck. He was a norteño -holding his red-rag in hand one hand as he stepped out of his car trying to look 'hard'. Then he saw me, with buttons and his whole demeanor changed.  From across the street, he called out to me "Is that a snake?"  "yeah..." I explained.  The young man, probably my age (23), came close to check out Buttons. He was scared and I thought to myself, how funny -a norteño is afraid of a snake. I also was somewhat disturbed by his red-rag. He seemed like a nice guy and I felt sorry that he was choosing gangs, either as a lifestyle or as a 'poser'. I wish I had asked him his name. Maybe I'll see the guy again. Who knows.

      My father was born 52 years ago on May 23rd. We just talked to him on the phone and we ended up waking him up.  One of the coolest things I remember about my dad is how he used to listen to me practice my piano. He would sit on the green Lazy-Boy chair that he re-upholstered as I played my songs. Sometimes, he would read, other times, he would stare at some idea off in the distance -index finger between his chin and lower lip, 'just thinking' as he would say.  Eventually he would lean the chair backwards, take a deep breath, push his glasses to his forehead and cover his eyes with his hand.  Sleep usually followed.  Normally, my dad would nap in his bed-room so it felt wonderful to know that my playing was nice enough that he would want to listen. I miss being able to play for him like that.  Currently, I don't have a piano but at least I have a guitar. I think I would go crazy if I didn't have a musical way to express myself.  anyway, tomorrow (or later today I guess) is my last day of work and there is a lot to accomplish yet. So I should go to bed.

      I have bought the domain name  urlLink  AnthonyDias.com  and I am excited because now I can finally create my own website. I don't know when I'll get around to it, but it just feels nice to have your own domain name I guess.

      In less than two weeks, I am going to visit my family in North Africa! My little sister is graduating from High School. I am amazed that we are all getting so old! I will be in Casablanca, Morocco for almost 3 weeks then I come back to work at  urlLink Camp MayMac  !  At the same time, I am quitting my job at  urlLink  SpanishMasters   where I have worked off and on since December of 2000. Wow, in 4 years, I have learned and benefited much by working at SpanishMasters, but it is time for me move on and hopefully get my bachelors degree at an art school somewhere.  In the mean time, I can't wait to see my family and the new school that is getting built. It's gonna be great!

      I have made the transition from Morocco to MayMac!  My beautiful sister Omayra graduated from GWA on Saturday June 19th, the following day, there was a great banquet for the Seniors and on the 21st, I was on a plane headed back to the USA.  I had a nice flight from Casa Blanca to New York. There were a few students from my dad's school. I sat with Saad Benkirane a young man who is my brother Jeremiah's age. Saad's sisters Lina and Maria and his parents were also on the flight. (Mr. Benkirane owns the restaurant where the banquet was held, it's called Cities Restaurant)  Anyway, from New York to San Jose was almost unbearable but I made it!  Anyway, from now until I'm done with MayMac, I'll be keeping my web log at the  urlLink Spike at Camp MayMac   site.  -Tony

      George Washington Academy is now in finals. I just got a copy of the school year-book and plan to get kids signatures.  I've had a great vacation so far. I went to the beach a second time (with the all 42 high schoolers). I played guitar at the school. I have gone several times to an area of town called Maarif to draw the people passing by.  Unfortunately, my vacation is coming to an end!!! But the next part of my summer begins right away at Camp MayMac.  That's it for now, not much to say I guess.

      So, here I am, in the Library at George Washington Academy, typing away on a slow internet connection but enjoying my vacation none the less.  Monday morning after a nasty stay in a New York Hotel, I took off to central park in Manhattan. This was a much nicer view of New York. I went around, toting my luggage and my guitar. Stopping to play here and there. I made ten dollars and change just by playing. The most money was made when I sat down next to a crowd of Italian ladies, mostly in their 40's and 50's and full of life (if you know what I mean). They really liked my guitar playing and singing. Soon after, it started raining and my show was cancelled :)  Oh well, I needed to go to the airport anyway.  That evening, I flew from New York to Casablanca and arrived here around 6:30 AM on Tuesday. My parents picked me up at the airport. We drove home where I briefly saw Jeremiah and Omayra(they had to go to school). A few hours later I visited the school.  urlLink George Washington Academy . It was nice to see students and teachers that I know from years past. The children are so beautiful here.  Wednesday, I was promoted to Senior status and I accompanied(drove) the Seniors(all 4 of them) to the beach for Senior 'cut' day. It did seem strange that the Principal's oldest son would help the seniors skip class, but even when I was a Senior back in '98, my dad let me go to the beach with my friends. My excuse the next day was exactly that and the secretary said. "well, at least you're telling the truth!".  I drove Omayra, Sarah, Jordan and Nadir in my  mom's van. We arrived a a nice beach where there weren't any people except for this one man who was fishing. There, I tried surfing for the first time in my life. Jordan (an avid surfer) brought along his surf-board and a long-board. I saw him ride a few waves pretty nicely. Nadir also went out using the long-board, trying his best to stand up. Finally, after about 45 minutes, he came in and asked if I wanted to try -I did!  The waves were choppy, coming in from different directions and although they didn't look big from shore, they sure felt huge once I was among them. In the 5 or so minutes that I floating around, I felt like I was doing more drowning than anything. So I came back to shore. That was at a beach in Bouznika.  We decided to go to another beach in a town called Mohammedia. There we ate lunch, and soon after I found myself trying to build a sand castle. I guess that was inevitable. The sand didn't hold to well, but it was good enough for me to try and build something. Not too long afterwards and I was in an argument with about 20 Moroccans who were trying to play soccer and thought that I was in their way. I didn't understand since I had been there first but I thought about it and told them that if they knocked down my sand-castle by accident, I wouldn't be mad. Anyway, the waves might come and do the same thing. I said in Arabic, "Makein moushkil" -no problem.  Then I decided to draw, and this girl who was about 11 years old, was coming around asking for money. I tried to explain to her in French and broken Arabic that I wasn't going to give her any money. But I told her if she wanted, I would sing songs for her and play guitar. She agreed and I played a bit. Then I showed her some of my drawings. Immediately she said "ateinee" (give-me).  To which I responded, "La, sme-helia" (no, sorry)  But then I asked her name. Fatima, she told me.  I began to draw her name out with my markers and she got excited. Before I finished writing her name there were another 5 kids sitting around me waiting for their name to be 'tagged' up. I suppose that these kids weren't used to getting anything other than a dirty look or a few Dirhams(Morocco's monetary unit). I was glad to give them something new. I ended up drawing 8 names total. By then, the Seniors were ready to go and I had to say good-bye.  There were two other guitarists there who had gathered around while I was drawing, as I left I heard one of them playing La Bamba. I had shown him the chords and gave him some tips on the strumming.  It was a cool day, overall. I enjoyed hanging with the Seniors.  Thursday and Friday weren't too exciting except for the GWA Soccer Match between the high school girls and Female Staff (the girls won 5 - 0).  Saturday we went to see the new property that belongs to the school. I took some pictures which I'll post up later. There has been a nice amount of progress since I was here a year ago.  Sunday, I was sick, probably with the Flu. (I'm still feeling it a bit). I think Jeremiah got me sick, that little booger! Just kidding.  Anyway, that's a short summary of my weekend.

      On my way here to Morocco, I had a lay over in New York. I arrived at JFK airport on Sunday Night, May 30th 2004. My first flight had been canceled from San Jose, and I had to wait for a later plane. At least I got to sit next to a guy who liked to talk, obviously I like to talk so it went well.  The plane arrived around 8:00 PM that night and I was experiencing New York for the very first time in my life. I had planned to stay the night at the airport, but my weary body said otherwise and I decided to get a hotel.  A very skinny Puerto-Rican girl at the reservations counter recommended a certain hotel which will remain unnamed. "Oh, it's very economical, very economical this hotel is... ".  Being as tired as I was, with my eyes burning because of my contacts, I really needed to get some rest. I should have known by the way she said 'economical' that the hotel she was booking me for would not be cool, but we all make mistakes and I decided to fork over 70 bucks plus tax so I could get out of the airport.  I took the Air-Train from the Airport towards Jamaica Station in Queens. Then, I took the E train to Manhattan. My hotel was on 83rd street, a few blocks away from Central Park. Now, when I think Manhattan, I think 'nice'. But this hotel I stayed in was nowhere near what I imagined.   Before I continue, I must say that I am thankful to have gotten some sleep that night. Other than that, the 'hotel' was the worst accommodation I have ever experienced! This was supposed to be New York??? It looked and felt like I was in Russia during the Cold War!  The room was on the fourth floor, measured about 8 X 10 feet, it featured a bunk-bed, absolutely no A/C, an empty refrigerator, a working sink, blankets, two tiny towels and a good view of the neighboring building's wall. The bathroom was a 'shared' bathroom that the whole floor used(2 per floor).  There was no elevator, the building was too old for that, so I'm glad I didn't pack a huge suitcase. I climbed the steps, carrying my back-pack, roller-bag and guitar. I was already sweating at the first floor! When I finally got to my room, I was relieved to find a fan in the window. As I reached for the electrical cord to plug it in, I found that there was no outlet close enough to do so. How stupid is that? Then I went back down to the 'lobby' and asked the clerk for bigger towels to which he replied, "oh, we are all out".      "well, do you have any extension cords, my fan doesn't have anywhere to plug in?"      "uh, we ran out of cords." Actually, I don't think they had cords, anyway, at least I had a good night's sleep considering I could have been sleeping on a chair at the airport, trying to make sure nobody took my stuff.  I won't mention the nasty shower and how it was plugged up with gunk and other people's hair. Nor will I tell you about the loud neighbors partying all night and keeping me up. But I must say that the next day, Memorial day, was much nicer. I hung out at Central Park. But I'll write about that later.
