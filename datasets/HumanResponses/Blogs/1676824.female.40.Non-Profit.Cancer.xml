      I wish I could talk, but only these hoarse sounds come out.    I have a propensity toward laryngitis, which is unfortunate considering I earn my living talking on the phone.  This is day 2 of no voice, but I think it is getting better.     The people at work are going to start wondering whether I intend to work anymore, but I DO!   Britty has been going to day care to spare me my voice during the day.   So it is just me and cleaning and watching tv... oh and surfing the internet... let's not forget that!   Boring.

      Today is my birthday.   I am 39 (really).   I had to go to the DMV to get my driver's license renewed, which was not that eventful, except they are in a hurry there and Britty thought this would be a great time to take off her shoes.   She did fine there, though, really.    Two-year-olds can be patient sometimes.   On the way home, I got a migraine, so since I had no tylenol with me and I had to go grocery shopping anyway, it was off to the store for about 1/2 hour.   I know when I wasn't looking, someone hit me in the forehead with a hammer.  :-)    I think we will spend the rest of the day watching soaps, eating pizza and napping (perhaps not in that order).   I am glad to have the day off to relax.   It is good to be home!

      Ok, whoever decided 114 in the shade was good weather for a t-bucket rally is really just insane.  Fortunately, I haven't spent too much time outside.. just here and there as my mom decided to shop "here and there" and "everywhere".    It's ok, though.   Hot weather is perfect for toting a 2 year old around.  :-)  Actually, she did quite well, even with the 2 minute nap she had.  On the other hand, I expect to find Larry properly toasted when he returns today.  They made a run to somewhere in MO this morning, and now they are at Cabela's and Kansas Speedway.   It is far too hot to be driving around in a car with no roof and no air-conditioning!   It is kind of fun to see a bunch of t-buckets altogether.   For the last 5 or 6 years, I felt like we were the only ones with this sort of project.   It is very clear, though, that some of these people have more money than they know what to do with... especially the couples with his and hers t-buckets.   That is just crazy (I'm sorry!).  Overall, this has been a good trip, but there is something wonderful about returning home to familiar surroundings and the security all of that involves.

      The heat and humidity continue, but hey I am in air conditioning most of the day anyway.   Aside from that, I would not complain.  I am just a warm weather person.   Guess how many people ask me what the weather is like here throughout the day?  I troubleshoot for remote laptop users, so out of 30 calls a day, I would say I get into some sort of weather dialog 30 times.   Also, everyone wants to know how I am doing, for some reason.   Lately, I have chosen to not answer a couple of them just to see what they would do.  You know what?  They just go onto their troubleshooting issue.   It's good to have at least one scientific experiment a day.  We are preparing for a weekend in Kansas City at the t-bucket rally:  http://www.nationaltbucketalliance.com/     Mostly, I plan to spend time with my parents, whom I haven't seen in almost a year, since they moved to Virginia, my brother and my sister-in-law who is newly pregnant (yeah).   I am attempting to draw on Britty's psychic abilities to determine the sex of the baby.   She changes her mind every day.    She's only 2!   You can't expect full blown psychic abilities at this stage.  Yesterday, I got some really cool graphics for this site.   I have published HTML before, but am totally unfamiliar with css or java script.   I am somewhat proud of myself for nailing it on the first try.   (clap for me... now!)   :-)

      How hot does it have to be?   It's got to be at least 90 outside, but I welcome the summer.   Winter is so cold and miserable in Nebraska.  Brit and I went out for a mini shopping trip today.   Nebraska Furniture Mart had all of the large screen tv's on some kind of animated movie or another.  So we ended up with a Lilo and Stitch tape.   She is watching it now as she dozes off to sleep.  Britty's new thing today was stuffing all of her horses into the back of her "ice cream truck" and asking me if I want to see them.   "Mommy, wanna see?"   Then she would open the back of the truck, pick out a horse and hold it up proudly, as if it were the most beautiful thing in the world.   Naturally, I would let her know she is right, that horse is beautiful and she would grin from ear to ear.

      What a long day!   Seems like we spent all day dealing with the LoveSan virus.   CNN says it's not causing damage so far, but I beg to differ.  Some of our programs won't start and some of our customer's Microsoft apps are not working.   Plus, we have spent all day on the phone dealing with it... that's hardly no damage.     We are in hippy fix-it mode now.   Looking at surveys and trying to make things better.    I guess some good ideas can come out of things like that, but I'm not really in the mood to fix much more than I have to already fix while I am on the phone.   Maybe I'll snap out of it. I think Britty and I are making some headway in the mommy vs. toddler arena.   Toddlers can be wild at times, but the more I get of that wildness, the more I can handle.   I think it's the challenge of it all.   I am learning to stoop down to her level to speak to her.   Who says she has so much to learn from me?   Some of my biggest accomplishments come from learning from her.   Yesterday, I survived poopy pants, the dog pooping in the house and crayon on the wall.   Life is too short to be stressed out over small things.   "Small things" - things that are just momentary that go away in a short period of time.  :-)  This weekend, Brit and I went to the zoo.   Britty loves it.  In fact, she runs the whole way.   As she runs along, she says, "Mommy, come on, I want to show you something".     We counted alligators, watched the bear swim and stressed out over the apes.  She doesn't like apes.   I think it is because they are so human... maybe it freaks her out to see them caged.   The cats are her favorite, but they will have to keep until next time.   There is only so much zoo you can see on a hot day with a wild short-legged "monkey".

       Fun in the Sun  I wish....   I have my voice back now.   I have returned to work.   For a few days I was feeling pretty good about life in general, but then reality bit me in the butt and now we are back into the same old routine.    I don't know about anyone else, but I get tired of the same old routine every day.   I think I am in the wrong line of work.    Personally, I think I should be aiming for early retirement.   That would be cool (and fair) at 39.  During the "nothing is going on" minutes during work, I find myself missing Britty.   I can't wait to leave work and see her face when I arrive at school... that big smile and the resounding "Mommy!" in the room.   It's something that gets me through my day most days.   I guess that is why I don't let people get to me over the help desk phone line most of the time.   Float on, you are not that important.   I like to help, don't get me wrong, but some of these people require a serious symphony of violins.   Sometimes I worry that my mute button is not actually muting.   That would stink...  considering.  Tomorrow is the IS Picnic.  Since I joined IS and they've had a picnic, we've been going.   It is always at FunPlex.  Britty loves the water, so it should be a good time.

      Off to Virginia Beach Tomorrow, we start our trip to Virginia Beach.  There is another hurricane (Juan) looming in the Atlantic Ocean, but not expected to hit the eastern seaboard. Sadly, Larry won't be joining us.  I don't know how it's going to be to haul a 3-year-old across the country, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.

      Thanks, Isabel! This is so nice... after 4 months of planning, those tickets we purchased for VA Beach have washed away with the tide!   At least my prayers of reducing the intensity at landfall were answered.   I don't know how things are there yet, but I'm betting a cat 5 would have been a lot worse.   I have learned one valuable thing:  Never buy non-refundable tickets!  Oh, and Delta stinks (I guess that makes two things).   On the good side, since at least Brit and I were able to reschedule our trip, Ginger doesn't have to go anywhere and no one has to watch the house.  Oh, and we can go to Kamden's 3rd birthday party.   Kids grow too fast.   Just yesterday our kids were infants!    Now Britty is 3 and learning more and more everyday, like "My eyes are green" ...   she even recognized her name when it is written (or she is a good guesser, anyway).  By the way, Dr. Phil is boring as heck.  Half of the CD I was listening to was about what he wanted his book to accomplish.  That's very unhelpful.    What an ego!

      Fun in the "Sun" We had a great trip to see Grandma and Grandpa.   Thankfully, Britty LOVED the plane ride.   When we landed in Virginia Beach, she said, "I want another plane."    Fortunately, we had other things to do beside ride the plane.    My mom and dad have a lovely house which is quite close to the ocean.   Brit and I both love the ocean and got to visit there often.   We stood where the waves broke on the beach and felt the water rush in and out.    The movement made her dizzy, though! We got to visit the Virginia Marine Science Museum and actually touch stingrays.   They are wonderful, friendly animals, and I think that was my favorite part of the aquarium.    We also got to tour the USS Wisconsin and see the Norfolk Navy Yard.   It was fun to see so many things and to see my parents again.

      We all enjoyed the wedding and had a wonderful time.   For May, I think it was the hotest day ever, though.   The church is old, so some areas are air conditioned and some are not.  Britty did a wonderful job (better than expected) of dropping her petals on the floor.  Actually, she bent down and placed them carefully on the floor.  :-)  It was too cute. Holly was overcome with emotion just before walking down the aisle and everyone did their best to make her laugh.  I think it was a hard day for dad, as he realized the gravity of the day and he had to give away his little girl.   It was hard for me, as well.  We know she is in the best hands, though, and we wish them all of the best life has to offer.   Our role is not ending here, but only changing slightly.    Today we drove to Coin, Iowa to place flowers on the graves of Larry's grandparents.  Larry's dad accompanied us, and we had a chance to talk about all kinds of things along with way, including the war, the upcoming election and various other things.  It's always interesting to get different perspectives on these things...  seriously.  We did not visit Cassie's house today.   Cassie is my niece that died at birth.  She is in the Voss Mohr cemetary not far from here.   Britty and I visit her occassionally, as we did this past Friday.   This time, Britty showed Cassie her horses, and then we visited the graves of others and made sure their flowers weren't falling over or misplaced.   Cemetaries are calming places for me, and I don't mind spending some extra time in one.   This particular cemetary used to be a thinking place for me when I was in high school.   I found the grave of a father of one of my classmates, Shelba Perkins, who died in 1989.   That would have made her 25 when her dad died.  As I look at the stones, I always wonder about the story behind their life and death...was it sudden? an accident?  an illness?  Where they old or young and why people live for varying amounts of life.   I never wonder too much about what they have missed.  I believe people are meant to live the lives they live and whatever they are given is a blessing.  I know some people do not see their lives as a blessing, and really they have reason not to.  I think it all is in the grand plan, however.  I'll get off of my soap box now.

      Just three days until Holly and Bryan's wedding day.   It's 9:45 and I'm just getting done cleaning the house.   JD will be spending the night tomorrow after flying in from Hickam (Hawaii) AFB.   My brother Chris is coming on Friday.   This weekend is going to be very busy, but we are looking forward to seeing everyone and seeing the wedding.   It's hard to believe it's almost here.  I read today about a terrible thing... A mother in Des Moines punished her 3 year old step son by running cold water on him long enough to bring his body temperature down to the mid-80's.   I wish I could find her in the phone book.  "Deplorable" doesn't quite do that justice.   I can't imagine the trauma that little boy went through.  I wish someone could look over all of the children in the world and keep them safe.  It's the least anyone could do.   These are the years that shape us into who we are.  I think that is why no one remembers too much about being 3.  Some days (most days), I can't wait to wrap my arms around my little girl and tell her I love her.

      http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/792122.html  I hit the worst of our weather about 15 blocks from day care yesterday afternoon.  Water was rushing down Q street toward 84th Street at the edge of the street.  Some of the SUV's driving in that lane created splashes higher than my car.   Visibility was down to a couple feet, at best.    I decided to bypass the slowing traffic and take the turning lane up the street when I saw a black cloud with a few suspicious funnels coming out of it.    I had to blow through a stop light after I made sure it was safe to drive across the street.  When I got to day care, they were taking the kids into the shelter to watch Nemo.  I was amazed that one of the parents was putting their child in their car when I arrived.  When I got out of the car, it was POURING and hailing.   I can't believe someone was going to drive off with the streets like that and hail going on.   It's just too stupid.  I waited in the shelter with the kids for about 15 - 20 minutes and the weather passed by.  Pretty freaky.   All I could think about is if there was a tornado, I wanted to be with Britty.   This was not the time for stop lights.

      That may sound extreme, but really going to training class is a bunch better than going to work.   I like my job; don't get me wrong, but there is not too much in life you can't use a break from.   I know you agree.  :-)  I am learning all kinds of nifty stuff about XP... most of it is already familiar.  The most interesting thing so far has been the xp "narrator", where it will read a website for me.   Is that lazy or what, considering I can actually see and everything.   Tomorrow we are going to learn about softskills.   My suggestion for dealing with difficult customers?  Hang up.   Is that so wrong?   Wouldn't YOU??   Fortunately, I don't get too many of those, but I would like to think I can hold my own when I do.   I think it's fun to be in a room full of some of my favorite people.   It's a fun way to spend the day, even if they are trying to treat us like ice sculptures.   Hey, I don't need refrigeration.  One of our district managers died on May 11.   I can still hear, "Yes, this is...." from previous conversations.   I see through the death notice that he was a Viet Nam vet.  As I think about this, I remember all of the people I talk to throughout the day and those of them who share a piece of their life with me... and the people I will never know anything about, to speak of.   I am grateful for the ones that feel like I'm more than a voice on the phone.  I know that I will never hear, "Yes, this is.." in quite the same way again.  Changing the subject, my tv show for today is "Animal Psychic".  I have never seen that before, but I found it to be quite fascinating.   I believe in psychic abilities, afterlife and all of that.   I guess mostly because it is so interesting to believe there is communication outside of our "world", and it's soothing to believe there are things happening which we cannot see or put a pin on, and life goes on after we die.   I'm sorry if that's wierd.  Anyway, my energy is winding down, so I'm going to leave now and find out if the cat, dogs or bird have any special psychic requests of me.  :-)   Sleep well.

      Welcome back from what seems to be quite a long hiatus.  Sometimes I don't feel like writing.  Today Brit and I took Ted to the vet.  A few words about Ted:  He is old and he has always lived outside, much to my dismay.  We make him comfortable with a dog house, heated pad, heated water bowl, etc, and he loves being out with nature.   But he is not the best-groomed dog, which makes going to the vet embarassing.   Larry wouldn't let that bother him, but I do.   Lucky for me, there is a groomer working out of the vet's office, so that's where he is.   I don't know how much time Ted has left, but he's going to look good, damn it!  :-)

      Everyday, it seems like I am addicted to CNN online.   I know I shouldn't be, but like my father, I have a need to know what is going on in the world.    My dad is funny about that... Is it that you like the way of writing or is it that you need the local news, because I remember traveling with you and you had to have the newspaper from that town everytime we stopped somewhere?    Maybe it's that traveling is sometimes boring and you needed something to do.  :-)  Anyway, what is going on in the world is quite disturbing.  While I'm sure that George Bush has a lot of room for criticism, can you imagine the great responsibility he has had in managing the country over the last 4 years?   He was faced with 911, something that no other president has had to face (at least during the time I've been alive); an attack of substantial proportions on US soil.   And everyday, when looking at CNN, I can't help but imagine the substantial burden and stress that running this country must put on every President we have had.  I am not a political writer at all.   I see the world through the writing of CNN and other news agencies, which I believe to not always be entirely accurate or unopinionated.   People write their opinions, even if they are news writers.  It is unavoidable.   A few weeks ago, I accused CNN of trying to grab undue attention via their headline phrasing.  I'm sure they all do it, but it was a story about how the Saudi government had "trained a terrorist".   It is not that Saudi Arabia makes a practice of training terrorists, just like the United States doesn't make a practice of training terrorists.  Remember Timothy McVeigh?  He was trained in the US military, but did we train him for the purpose of blowing up federal buildings?  I'm guessing not.  I love the United States and all of the freedoms I am allowed to enjoy.   Sometimes we take that for granted because there are some things that are not perfect here.   (For example, Nebraska taxes!)   And regardless of what policies President Bush comes up with or supports, even if I don't agree with him 100% of the time, I will respect and support this man who has taken on the leadership of our country, to an extent the way I do my own father.  I could never be anti-American or anti-President.   To me, that would be like rooting against my own team.     Back to the subject, the state of the world.    I believe that soon, great headway is going to be made in eliminating terrorist activity in Iraq.  There is too much activity going on there every day for it not to be dissuaded in some way.   Terrorists are cowards.  It takes a lot of guts to drug your victim so that he'll sit still in front of a camera and allow you to behead him without too much of a fight.  If they are so proud of what they are doing, why are they hiding behind all of that garb wrapped around their faces?     One thing that is bad is that we have created a perfect "breeding ground" if you will for terrorist activity.   It is like opening a new Disneyland and inviting everyone to come on over.   A new playground has been opened in Iraq.   There is no security to keep terrorists out, apparently.    The area needs to be locked down and weeded out, in my opinion.  Easier said than done, I am sure.

      It was too cute.  On the way home yesterday, I asked Britty what she would like for dinner...   She thought awhile and I tried to interject an idea.   Her response:  "Mommy, I'm trying to think..".    Ok, Britty.    Several seconds later.. "Mommy, I have an idea!  How about hot dogs?  That sounds like a great idea!"  I like being surprised by her.   I cannot say that about too many people, but there is something so unconditional about her and beautiful.   She is my safe place when everything else in the world seems to be falling apart.   She brings a smile to my face when I don't want to smile, and even when the day is bad, I can look her in the eye and say that everything is ok.   It is because you are here, and I can wrap my arms around you, smell your hair, smooch your face and everything is just fine.  I think parenthood is God's gift.   It humbles you.   It helps you return a little bit to the simplicity of life, watching cartoons, running aimlessly through a park chasing birds, learning to draw elephants..   It is the satisfaction of seeing your reflection and seeing that it is good.   It is the joy from those innocent "I love you"'s, kisses and hugs.  Thank you for blessing me.

      This week, I achieved something that I have not achieved, due to circumstance, for nearly 14 years... a promotion.   Oddly enough, the achievement was not so much a status earned, but rather accomplishments acknowledged to the extent that people have found them intelligent and worthwhile enough to promote me.  I do not come from a highly technical background, but I have a very strong need to learn and a curiousity about this line of work.   I learned enough to help the customers I work with every day, and expand my knowledge as I find things interesting enough to research.   To some of my customers, I am an expert and their gratitude is what I am working for, along with some increased understanding of their processes and the business reasons why their computer is so important to them.   Being financially minded in spirit (although not too successfully in practice!), I can only imagine what it's like to depend on sales and your persuasive skills to write your paycheck.   Being informed means everything and technical skills, at least to some extent, are critical to that process.  In the end, I'd like them to just care a bit about the advantage technology can give them.  Anyway, my vaguely amusing and slightly embarrassing moment of the day was totally screwing up this agent's internet connection.  He was too mad to speak, really, and I was very apologetic.   It was a communication error... but at least I learned from it and can avoid it in the future.    Hey, I make mistakes...sometimes several of them.  I'm only human (my new mantra).     At least I won't have to worry about him asking for me next time.   :-)

      Several weeks ago, we noticed a robin's nest in the tree in front of our house.   Every day, the mother and father birds have watched the nest for approaching people and dogs to protect the nest.   I guess it would not be so surprising to hear that the birds divebomb anything coming near the nest to protect their young.   Several days ago, the eggs hatched and I've seen at least two babies.  Since then, there has been lots of rain, wind and even a few hail storms, but the birds have persevered.   You have to respect a parent's ability and need to protect, so it was not so odd when my retriever approached one of the babies sitting on the ground for me to have ordered her away.   The mother had been watching the baby, anyway, and despite her size compared to my retriever, I'm sure she would have taken after her had she not retreated.     I watched at the window to see the mother hopping on the grass away from the baby.  The baby cannot fly yet, so her moving away from the baby makes it follow her to gain it's strength and perhaps encourage it to fly.  The beauty of nature is inspiring.   Take away the cares of the world, the pressures, the stress, and all that is really left is family bonding, a parent to it's baby, the child to its parents and siblings and the nurturing and care that results.   I wonder, as humans, why we have made life so much more complex.   The key to living, I believe, is to find the basic simplicity.. love and nurturing and make it the most important thing in your heart.   Maybe that is what gives us the strength, despite all odds (like the mother bird) to persevere.

      June 11, 2004  Mrs. Reagan, Patti, Michael and Ron, members of the Reagan family, distinguished guests, including our presidents and first ladies, Reverend Danforth, fellow citizens, we lost Ronald Reagan only days ago but we have missed him for a long time.  We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice and the happy ending we had wished for him.   It has been 10 years since he said his own farewell, yet it is still very sad and hard to let him go.   Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us.   In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy.  During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places, but there was only one person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room.   America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey and to that journey's end.   Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family.   When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California and we lay to rest our 40th president, a great American story will close.   The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms and carriages drawn by horse.   If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois, of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library or running with his brother Neil along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue.   That town was the kind of place he remembered where you prayed side by side with your neighbors.  And if things were going wrong for them, you prayed for them and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you.   The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty.   And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things.   The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago.  As the lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector, keeping an eye out for trouble.   As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did.   As an actor he was the handsome all-American good guy, which in his case required knowing his lines and being himself.   Along the way certain convictions were formed and fixed in twe should strive to know and do the will of God.  He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing.  He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free.  He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of.  He believed in the golden rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the world.   And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as we said, there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse.   Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known on occasion to change a man.  But not this man.  From Dixon to Des Moines to Hollywood to Sacramento to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow.   Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience.  His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral.   There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies.  The actor Robert Cummings recalled one occasion.   "I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed.  I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered some day becoming president?'   "He said, 'President of what?'   "'President of the United States,' I said.   "And he said, 'What's the matter?  Don't you like my acting either?"'   (LAUGHTER)   The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect.   He often began his speeches by saying, "I'm going to talk about controversial things."  And then he spoke of communist rulers as slave masters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near.   In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to govern.   As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the west, tanned, well-tailored, in command and on his way.  In the 1960s his friend Bill Buckley wrote, "Reagan is indisputably a part of America and he may become a part of American history."   Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980.  He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century as the convictions that shaped the president began to shape the times.   He came to office with great hopes for America.  And more than hopes.  Like the president he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action.   President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the rewards and spirit of enterprise.  He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required.   He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.   And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs.  When he saw evil camped across the horizon he called that evil by its name.   There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American president had dared to say.  There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall that the first and hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.   The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal tides and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage and triumph of free men and we believe it all the more because we saw that courage in him.   As he showed what a president should be, he also showed us what a man should be.   Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with the decency and attention to small kindnesses that also define a good life.   He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others.   Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand to family members on important occasions, to old friends dealing with sickness and loss, to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood.   A boy once wrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom.   (LAUGHTER)   The president replied that, "Unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."   (LAUGHTER)   He continued, "I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster...   (LAUGHTER)   "... therefore you are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation.   (LAUGHTER)   "Congratulations."   See, our 40th president wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson.   In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country.   We think of the steady stride, that tilt of the head and snap of the salute, the big screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind.   We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a scout saying the pledge.  We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice and frightened by nothing.   We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us.  But with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine days are behind us.  And that is worth our tears.   Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice in a moment of violence and then in the years of departing light.  He met both with courage and grace.  In these trials, he showed how a man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end.   And where does that strength come from?  Where is that courage learned?  It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself.  It is the faith of a man with a fearful illness who waited on the Lord to call him home.   Now death has done all that death can do, and as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared.   In his last years he saw through a glass darkly.  Now he sees his savior face to face.   And we look for that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and sure and smiling again, and the sorrow of this parting gone forever.   May God bless Ronald Reagan and the country he loved.

      Vice President's Remarks at President Reagan's Funeral  Remarks by the Vice President at the State Funeral of Ronald W. Reagan Washington, D.C. U.S. Capitol Rotunda      7:55 P.M. EDT    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mrs. Reagan, members of the President's family, colleagues, distinguished guests, members of the diplomatic corps, fellow citizens:   Knowing that this moment would come has not made it any easier to see the honor guard, and the flag draped before us, and to begin America's farewell to President Ronald Reagan. He said goodbye to us in a letter that showed his great courage and love for America. Yet for his friends and for his country, the parting comes only now. And in this national vigil of mourning, we show how much America loved this good man, and how greatly we will miss him.   A harsh winter morning in 1985 brought the inaugural ceremony inside to this Rotunda. And standing in this place for the 50th presidential inauguration, Ronald Reagan spoke of a nation that was "hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair." That was how he saw America, and that is how America came to know him. There was a kindness, simplicity, and goodness of character that marked all the years of his life.   When you mourn a man of 93, no one is left who remembers him as a child in his mother's arms. Ronald Wilson Reagan's life began in a time and place so different from our own, in a quiet town on the prairie, on the 6th of February, 1911. Nelle and Jack Reagan would live long enough to see the kind of man they had raised, but they could never know all that destiny had in store for the boy they called Dutch. And if they could witness this scene in 2004, their son taken to his rest with the full honors of the United States, they would be so proud of all he had done with the life they gave him, and the things they taught him.   President Reagan once said, "I learned from my father the value of hard work and ambition, and maybe a little something about telling a story." That was the Ronald Reagan who confidently set out on his own from Dixon, Illinois during the Great Depression, the man who would one day speak before cameras and crowds with such ease and self-command. "From my mother," said President Reagan, "I learned the value of prayer. My mother told me that everything in life happened for a purpose. She said all things were part of God's plan, even the most disheartening setbacks, and in the end, everything worked out for the best." This was the Ronald Reagan who had faith, not just in his own gifts and his own future, but in the possibilities of every life. The cheerful spirit that carried him forward was more than a disposition; it was the optimism of a faithful soul, who trusted in God's purposes, and knew those purposes to be right and true.   He once said, "There's no question I am an idealist, which is another way of saying I am an American." We usually associate that quality with youth, and yet one of the most idealistic men ever to become president was also the oldest. He excelled in professions that have left many others jaded and self-satisfied, and yet somehow remained untouched by the worst influences of fame or power. If Ronald Reagan ever uttered a cynical, or cruel, or selfish word, the moment went unrecorded. Those who knew him in his youth, and those who knew him a lifetime later, all remember his largeness of spirit, his gentle instincts, and a quiet rectitude that drew others to him.   Seen now, at a distance, his strengths as a man and as a leader are only more impressive. It's the nature of the city of Washington that men and women arrive, leave their mark, and go their way. Some figures who seemed quite large and important in their day are sometimes forgotten, or remembered with ambivalence. Yet nearly a generation after the often impassioned debates of the Reagan years, what lingers from that time is almost all good. And this is because of the calm and kind man who stood at the center of events.   We think back with appreciation for the decency of our 40th president, and respect for all that he achieved. After so much turmoil in the '60s and '70s, our nation had begun to lose confidence, and some were heard to say that the presidency might even be too big for one man. That phrase did not survive the 1980s. For decades, America had waged a Cold War, and few believed it could possibly end in our own lifetimes. The President was one of those few. And it was the vision and will of Ronald Reagan that gave hope to the oppressed, shamed the oppressors, and ended an evil empire. More than any other influence, the Cold War was ended by the perseverance and courage of one man who answered falsehood with truth, and overcame evil with good.   Ronald Reagan was more than an historic figure. He was a providential man, who came along just when our nation and the world most needed him. And believing as he did that there is a plan at work in each life, he accepted not only the great duties that came to him, but also the great trials that came near the end. When he learned of his illness, his first thoughts were of Nancy. And who else but Ronald Reagan could face his own decline and death with a final message of hope to his country, telling us that for America there is always a bright dawn ahead. Fellow Americans, here lies a graceful and a gallant man.   Nancy, none of us can take away the sadness you are feeling. I hope it is a comfort to know how much he means to us, and how much you mean to us as well. We honor your grace, your own courage, and above all, the great love that you gave to your husband. When these days of ceremony are completed, the nation returns him to you for the final journey to the West. And when he is laid to rest under the Pacific sky, we will be thinking of you, as we commend to Almighty the soul of His faithful servant, Ronald Wilson Reagan. "

      Today, we started the "fence project".   We got some people together (Larry's Dad, Bryan, Holly and JD) to help us out, and so far it's going very well.   I've never had a yard with a fence, but now it seems essential with Britty and an aging dog we would rather have roaming more freely.   We've been going since 9:30 this morning, and the uprights are all in and the cement is curing.    It's a lot of work, especially for Larry and our helpers.  Yesterday, we went to Mutual's Family Day at the Zoo.   I always enjoy the zoo, but this time it was better with an IMAX movie (Caves) and all the tram and carousel rides we wanted.  The zoo is pretty tiring on foot, so I appreciated the tram.  Britty seems to be in "no mode" lately.   Everything people tell her to do, she either ignores or says "no" to.  Britty wants to do what Britty wants to do.  That must end soon.  :-)   It's just one of those phase things, I'm sure.   Sometimes I get through to her and she tells people, "My mom's in charge."    I just like to remind her that she is not the boss of me, but quite the opposite.   Sometimes, I just have more patience than others, is all. lol

      Find the cool pictures   urlLink here ..   The dolphins are my favorite.  Also, welcome to the "blue moon".  Every so often (about every 32 months), there are two full moon phases in one month, and the second occurance is called the  urlLink blue moon.   Oddly enough, the moon is not actually blue.   And there is no "blood on the moon", which is good, also, especially for  urlLink Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock .  Obviously, I need some sleep..

      We were thinking about going to the  urlLink drive-in  tonight (yes, they still have one around here!), but if you click on the link above, you'll see what's playing.  Fun for me, but probably a psychological disaster waiting to happen for Britty.  :-)   Looks like it's back to a movie rental.. again.   Something to fall asleep to..  I spent a lot of time working on Britty's Shop the last couple of days.   It was fun to do.   Check out the shopping bag lower on the page if you get a chance.  Everything is priced extremely close to the manufacturer's cost.   If you need any shirts, notebooks, magnets, whatever, there is brittysgarden.com stuff, tbucket stuff and "I love Omaha" stuff.    Today, we went to an open house for a new hospital:  http://www.alegent.com/body.cfm?id=55.   It is so cool to tour a new hospital.. this is the first new hospital that's been built in probably 20 years.    We got a tour of the operating room, where they use  urlLink Stryker equipment  there and I was completely amazed at what that involved.  There is voice activated equiment and computers.  The doctor wears a microphone to tell the computer what to turn on or where to point the cameras that are viewing the surgical field.   Also, images can be sent from the computer's hub to various hospitals around the country that use Stryker systems, or to various other rooms throughout the hospital.  They can even call up x-rays online to view during the operation.   It's a computer geek's dream come true!   Do they have any job openings??   I wish I had stayed in nursing school.    Following are some photos of the  urlLink tbucket accident  that happened here last weekend.  You don't hear of cars like this being involved in too many accidents, thank God.   The people involved are still in the hospital with crushed ankles and broken jaws, but are expected to recover.  I'm a little puzzled lately.  I had been reading a blog called " urlLink Premises " and it has all but disappeared.   Premises was written by an american soldier in Iraq.   When the code was wiped out, I became concerned, but I'm going to chalk it up to someone getting bored or frustrated with blogging.  How could that HAPPEN??    I have to admit that I'm getting tired of sitting in front of my computer.   It seems to happen far too much!   So, off I go!  Oh, this is a cute little  urlLink song..   Have a good one!

      If you have been here before, you will have to forgive my sudden design change and your "now missing" comments.  The old design was becoming increasingly difficult to make changes to, so I decided to go with something more facilitative.   You may already know this, but once I start changing the design of my blog, it takes quite a few hours for me to get it the way I want it.   Help me!   I can't stop coding!!!!  I have added a few things to the side-bar.   One of them is a charity area.  I am trying to raise money for purchasing school supplies for Iraqi children.  We have a campaign like this for our own city's children.  I think it is a very worthwhile cause.  Also, I have posted a shortcut to the animal rescue website.  Each click is free and gives a needy animal .6 cups of food or care.   You can't beat free.   Be sure to click once on my page and then find the same button on the next page and click it.  Also, look for 2 new stores.  One is Britty's Shop under Favorites.   The other is the animal rescue site store, called "The Completely Different Store", toward the top of the page.  Proceeds go to helping to feed and care for maltreated animals.  Do yourself a favor.. go shopping!   It's the right thing to do.  :-)  Anyway, here is a  urlLink song for you , and I hope to have something more entertaining to write about tomorrow.  Guten nacht! Lisa

      Thanks, Fay, for showing me this great site.  This is exactly what I was looking for.   When we first went to war in Iraq, President Bush urged children to donate money to the Iraqi children, which we participated in.   Here is another excellent cause to  HELP IRAQI CHILDREN :    urlLink SCHOOL SUPPLIES FOR IRAQI CHILDREN    Each person or group can create 6 kits contained in ziplock bags and send them off to the warehouse in Kansas City for shipment to Iraq.  I think it would be really easy to get a box of this stuff together, especially since school supplies will be on sale soon.   School Kits for Iraq Checklist   Please review these instructions carefully before sending any School Supply Kits.  BUILDING SCHOOL SUPPLY KITS:  While it is tempting to send boxes of random supplies, the most efficient and effective way to help Iraqi children is to create sets of our School Supply Kits, which will be distributed to each student. Each Kit contains basic, badly-needed items that can make a world of difference to a child heading to school.  Assembling standardized Kits ensures that each child receives the same number of the most needed items, facilitates customs clearance, and relieves our volunteers and soldiers of the time-consuming and labor intensive process of sorting and allocating random donated items.  Kits are wildly popular among Iraqis, who often request them.  Assemble each Kit accroding to the following list of items.  Please enclose NO additional items, and be sure that all items are new and unused.  Each Kit should contain:     One pair of blunt-end scissors   One 12-inch ruler with metric markings   12 new pencils with erasers   One small pencil sharpener   One large eraser   One box of colored pencils (Crayons melt in the Iraqi summer heat!)   One package of notebook paper   One composition book   Three folders with inside pockets   One zippered pencil bag      See the site for detailed instructions.  If you do not like to shop, you can also send a  urlLink monetary donation .

      I'll be outside swingin the little kid.   Here's a song to keep you  urlLink occupied .  It's a re-run, but I'm in love with it.    guten nacht! Lisa  PS  Pass it on!   Over ten million animals are abused, neglected or abandoned yearly.  You   can help each day with a free click!  Visit The Animal Rescue Site at  urlLink http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com  daily  and click the purple button.  That simple action gives food to an abandoned  or abused animal.   There is no cost to you!   Funding for nutritious food is paid by site  sponsors and goes to nonprofit animal welfare organizations who use it to feed animals living in their shelters and sanctuaries.  The Animal Rescue Site was launched in July of 2002 and generated 22.9 million bowls of food for animals in its first year, and more than 28 million bowls in 2003! your help, many more animals will benefit in 2004.    It all depends on the number of people who visit the site.

      This is what's going on in VA Beach, or so my dad would have me believe:    "Reconnect with your aquatic origins by spending all of today underwater.  It is common knowledge that the old theory about man evolving from apes on the dry plains of Africa is wrong.  Rather, scientists now believe that man got caught in flooded swampland and was thus forced to rise from a four-legged posture to a two-legged one, so as to avoid drowning.  Hence the various features that distinguish us from apes: our hairlessness, our capacity to control our breathing, our relatively large proportions of subcutaneous fat.  Spend today underwater and feel the fish within."  Of course, not my idea, but the idea of those crazy Benrick Limited people: " urlLink This Book Will Change Your Life ."

      The little kid decided it would be a good idea to spray Renuzit air freshener in her mouth tonight and also on the dog (the label says, "Do not spray directly on pets".)  They said to just have her drink sweet liquids to balance out her blood sugar since the alcohol in Renuzit can sometimes alter their sugar levels, but one spritz should not be a big deal.  Gave her a glass of apple juice, had her drink it all and gave her a stern lecture about the hazards of ingesting things in spray bottles.   Ergh!  I will say that at least she smells good.  Luckily the one spritz she gave herself made her gag so that further applications were not required.  I am suddenly reminded of the time my brother John swallowed a bottle of cologne..    Parental lesson number 233:  Keep all spray bottles out of arms reach when child is standing on stool.     Parental lesson number 234:  Keep child off stool.  Lessons are good as long as no one gets hurt in the process.  One other thing I learned early on (TWO YEARS AGO) that I see parents doing ALL the time is that elbows and shoulder joints... they can pop out of place if you pull on them (sometimes, not even hard).   I see parents lifting kids up stairs sometimes by pulling their arms and cringe because I am remembering when I was walking with Britty into the house one day.   Suddenly, she tried to resist going into the house, so rather than allow her to fall back onto the sidewalk we were walking on, I pulled her forward.   Pop goes the elbow.   You could not see the problem.. you only knew there was one because she was holding her arm as if she was in an achey sort of pain.   The doctor popped the joint back in (and showed me how, if it ever happened again) and thankfully that never happened again, because it was traumatic for both of us.   I felt like the worst mom in the world that day, and for several days after.

      I think my daughter's favorite activity ever is swinging on her swingset.She has  not yet grasped the concept of the leg movements perpetuating her swinging, so if she wants to swing, I have to be there to push.   I have to admit that every day, I do not feel like pushing.   Much like any task in my life, monotony will kill my motivation.    However, I realize that if I can just get out there and do it, I am able to enjoy her constant laughter as she is being pushed.   It makes me happy to hear her laugh, so I don't mind the swing so much... at least for a time.  I am going through phases today of complete boredom.  I think it is just a Wednesday thing.   It is also an "I can't believe I have to work 5 days in a row" thing.   Sad, but true.    I really need to start buying lottery tickets.   It's not that work is bad.   It is just that I can think of things that would be more fun to do.   Can't we all?  A  urlLink Panera Bread  store just opened down the street from my work.   For those of you who don't know, this used to be The St. Louis Bread Company, a cafe that makes it's own breads, muffins, cookies and bagels and sells hem at one side of the store, and makes lunch/dinner sandwiches, soup and salads on the other.   The portabella mushroom sandwich, the tomato and mozarella salad and the strawberry poppyseed salad are all quite good.   I haven't found anything I didn't like there, but my husband is not particularly impressed with this restaurant yet.   He goes there rarely enough that once in a while is tolerable, though.

          The suggestion listed below is from Benrick Limited's, "This Book Will Change Your Life".   I do not take any responsibility for angry zookeepers chasing after you and causing bodily or emotional injury.  "Today, go to the zoo and DO FEED THE ANIMALS.  Zoo animals have a miserable time as it is.  They should have the right to stuff their faces, whatever some fascist zookeeper says.  Here are some of their favorite foods in the wild, so you know what to take along:  Elephant - Grass Zebra - More Grass Hippo - Salmon (smoked) Bear - Berries Anteater - Beetles Anaconda - Rats Giraffe - Small birds as they fly past Bald Eagle - Ice cream cones Lion - Zebras Gorilla - Bananas Giant Panda - Ginseng Leaves Electric Eel - Plankton"  Have a fun day at the zoo!

      Isn't the week just speeding by?  :-)   I'm sorry, but I've had too many 3-day work-weeks lately, and looking ahead to a 5-day week is not dismal at all, but, as Britty would say, "It's not my favorite."   But I guess the mortgage company is expecting a little something towards my house this month...    Bustards!  (sic)  I did something "extraordinary" today.   I got up on the second alarm ring, at 5am, got ready for work and made my family waffles for breakfast. Normally, I sleep through 4 or 5 alarm cycles and am then running too late to have breakfast.   With a child to drag out of bed in the morning, it was additionally challenging, but mission accomplished!   My stepdaughter and her husband gave me chocolate waffle mix (and a waffle iron) for my birthday.  Normally I dislike any chocolate in the morning, but these were quite good.   Really, people who make chocolate coffee, chocolate croissants, chocolate muffins.. should be on their own chocolate island.  One of my teammates is completely wired today.  He woke up at 4am to take his wife to the airport and then came to work.   I think he will be dozing off by the end of the day.   This would not be something new.   Sorry, dude!   I had to blow your cover!  I picked up an interesting and entertaining book over the weekend.  It is called, "This Book Could Save Your Life".    If you get a chance to browse through it in the bookstore, do, and if it makes you giggle (or "laugh", for you men), buy it.   You'll have entertaining projects to do for a whole year, like writing letters to mass murderers (you want them to have your name and address, right?), calling people at random to give them a very long speech about the resounding benefits of being an extreme Jesus follower, etc.    Their website is http://www.thiswebsitewillchangeyourlife.com/.  Check it out!  "I woke up one morning and all of my stuff had been stolen...and replaced by exact duplicates.'  Steven Wright

      I'm not a huge Britney fan, but I am strangely attracted to this  urlLink video . It's spooky, man!  Like my shiner?    I got this in the middle of the night by walking into the corner of an armoir (accidentally, of course).   I am kinda proud of my shiner.  I have never had one before.   Before you know it, I'll be boxing!!  You can see a full-face view by reading my profile.  I kind of look like a boxer...  I must admit, I am having a lot of fun since getting serious about my blog and poking around in others'.   If you look at my list of links, I read most of those daily and am finding more all the time.  I am developing new interests.. I don't know if I'm ready for Buffy the Vampire Slayer yet, but certainly I enjoy these blogs and some of the linkages thereof, for example, the "How Stuff Works" site allowed me to learn all about GPS receivers today.  If I travelled at all, I might think about one.   But alas, I am holed up here in Nebraska...trying to avoid cow tramplings and darting through feedcorn.. never to leave the house again (or the cornfield, as the case may be) except for work!  lol  Seriously, though.. (I am a city girl, really!)  Have a good evening.   As the truckers in the 70's would have said, "I'll catch ya on the flipside".   Truckers are strange people.  Ask  urlLink Mario .

      First of all, last night, I spent FOREVER trying to get my stripes to line up on this page again.  I had inserted something and the stripes between the main area that you are looking at now and the outside, bolder area were all askew.   I could not go to sleep with it like that!   It turned out to be a matter of adjusting a table height.  Secondly, I have decided on a few new phases in my life.   Phase 1:   Physical.   I will become for physically fit if it's the last thing I do!   I have received Dr. Phil's healthy eating recipe book and found some CD's on ebay last night for the companion book describing how to adjust your attitude to become more physically fit for life.   I am highly motivated.   Phase 2:   Emotional:   I will choose my battles carefully and intelligently.    Often, if something strikes me the wrong way, I feel a need to say something about it.  While being opinionated is not such a bad thing, it is sometimes extremely emotionally draining for me.    I have to break the cycle, although it may be difficult.    I have a few good role models, though, like my dad (who never seems to hold a grudge about anything) and my sister-in-law, Jodi, who I have never seen upset (although I'm sure she does get upset occasionally!).    Anytime I write letters complaining about something to these people, they generally let me resolve it myself.    When it is really important, they will speak up, but otherwise I think they allow me to vent and trust that I will work it out myself.   I don't see this as a bad thing.   In fact, I want to be more like that.  Thirdly, I am tired and would rather be at home sleeping right now.   But, alas, I am taking phone calls.    It'll be ok, though... only 7 1/2 hours to go.   We are mid, "reboot your machine" mode for the office staff, thanks to some software IS sent out that conflicts with their forced Monday morning, "we need to backup your machine weekly" process.   Yay!  Fourthly, the flag is half-staff at my office today and I do not know why. It could be because of the  urlLink two soldiers from Nebraska who were KIA .   One was buried Saturday and the other will be buried today.   Sad.  Have a good day today...    Lisa

      Something I found interesting on the Dr. Phil website: Rebuilding a Parent/Child Relationship  If you want to rebuild a troubled relationship with your parent or child but aren't sure where to start, Dr. Phil has advice:   Stop judging.  You can love your parent or child without loving every aspect of his/her life.    Be honest.  Tell the truth or don't say anything at all. You can be honest while retaining a boundary of respect. If discussing certain topics leads to arguments, you can simply say, "I don't want to talk about that."   Talk about things that don't matter.  If all you ever talk about in a relationship are problems, you have a problem relationship. Start talking about things that aren't crucial and don't cause conflict so that the two of you can get used to talking on a regular basis without arguing. This way, when you do have something important to talk about, the lines of communication will be open.   Forgive yourself.  There comes a time when you have to leave the past in the past and stop beating up on yourself. If you have guilt about your previous actions toward your parent or child, choose to forgive yourself.    Make a fresh start.  Once you have forgiven yourself and your loved one, you can rebuild your relationship without focusing on past conflicts. Commit to renegotiating the relationship with new boundaries.   Ease into it.  Don't expect your relationship to change overnight. Move forward together at a pace that is comfortable for both of you. If you take three steps forward and run into a problem, allow yourself to take a step back. When you are ready, take a step forward again.

      First of all, to my many, many millions of readers in America and across the world, bienvenue (welcome!)  "Millions" may be a slight overstatement.  When I go into work in the morning, I am "carded" (i.e. asked to present ID).  I am greeted by one of two security personnel:  The friendly Bahamian who is always wishing me a happy day OR "evil security guy" with the brown curly hair who it is good not to hear from because when he utters any words, it is blatantly obvious that he is full of himself because he IS a security dude.   There is respectful, authoritative security, and then there is just being an ass.   So, in recognition of the Bahamian who tries to make my workday start nicely, I have picked this Island-sounding  urlLink music  that happens to be my favorite "reggae" piece right now.  I know the Bahamas is not about reggae, but it always makes me think of warm, relaxing escapes to the Islands (mon!)  Or as Yahoo! Launch would say: "the trance-inducing Diwali rhythm gradually transforms an ordinary slow jam into a tropical aphrodisiac."  Here is another item of interest(different topic):  Giving a congressional greeting in Native American language  urlLink (Lakota)    I think every now and then, it is healthy to remember the original inhabitants of our country.   My daughter is a small part Navajo with a lot of English, Czech and some Scot mixed in.  Hooray for the "melting pot".    Here is today's  urlLink video ,which has nothing at all to do with anything I have just said (as usual).

      I saw the headline for this  urlLink story  and found myself somewhat relieved and reassured.  I do not want to see John Kerry as president for several reasons, and probably some of them not the right reasons. It is not that I think George Bush is the greatest President ever, but I think it would be a good idea to let him finish what he started.  Here is what bugs me about Kerry (this is where I will circumstantially offend my mother-in-law, a staunch supporter... it's nothing personal):   1.  He seems entirely TOO  urlLink chummy  with John Edwards (and so does his wife).  2.  He seems unprofessionally outspoken.   Sometimes his slams on Bush are just rude. "'What we have to realize is that being responsible about the environment is not some cuckoo, do-gooder, silly notion that you embrace once a year on Earth Day,' said the Massachusetts senator", quoted from the St. Petersburg Times.   Maybe he is right, but I prefer a slam that doesn't use the word "cuckoo". (welcome to politics, Lisa!)  3.  Being an IS person, too many times I have seen a project manager replaced in the middle of a project.   The new project manager may be perfectly fine, but the point is that no two project managers will run the same project the same way.  The result: major disarray for a period of time.  4.  We are at a touchy point in our history.  We have our hands in a lot of military "projects".   It would be a bad time, when we don't HAVE to, to change the project manager.   On the other hand, sometimes I wonder if a change would do us good at this point. I am not one to support taking risks in that regard, especially with our soldiers and when the new project manager may pull our military from areas that may potentially:  1.  Negate the good that has been done (getting rid of Saddam).  i.e. talking down about the decision to go to war undermines several original intents (one of them removing a known murderer from power) and causes a loss of confidence and solidarity with the Iraqi people.  2.  Make the US lose face or make us appear like cowards.  We may as well hold up signs for terrorists if we do that.   "Come and get us.  Our leader will run from you." From the NPR Morning Edition on July 23, 2004: "Meanwhile, Sen. John Kerry, his Democratic opponent, is trying to capitalize on polls showing a majority of Americans now believe the decision to go to war was a mistake.  But it's not clear how Kerry's approach to rebuilding Iraq would differ from Bush's if he wins in November ."   It is that lack of clarity that bothers me.   If Kerry is elected, I fully plan to move to Freeport, Bahamas, open a large rum drink shop and retire.   LOL   BTW, this cracks me up!  Long face, get it?! :-)      OK, I am easily amused.

      One of the biggest idioms in the American language is "Forgive and Forget".  If you forgive, you have no reason to forget, and vice-versa, thus making it "idiomatic" or "A speech form or an expression of a given language that is peculiar to itself grammatically or cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements, as in keep tabs on," according to dictionary.com.  Forgiving someone is a gift to the forgivee.   I believe that when  you feel  someone wrongs you, this is why it becomes hard to forgive.  You don't want to give any gifts to someone who just ticked you off for some reason.  Also, it is so easy to work toward making a wrong situation become understandable, that sometimes the attempt to understand the situation further destroys the relationship.     I have come to a point in my life where it is not always necessary for me to understand why people do the things they do.  I recently had a long, involved situation where I felt that I felt I was always at war with someone.   I spent a lot of time trying to say that I was right for feeling hurt by what someone else was saying or doing (by the way, this was not my husband!)  In the end, the biggest test of my character was to say, "Ok, I was hurt, some of that has been by my choice, and I'm tired of feeling this way.  Now what can I do to make this relationship better" instead of dwelling on my pain and attempting to make the other person feel it.  I would like to quote my favorite psychoanalyst, a man that makes a lot of sense to me, Dr. Phil (don't discount him just because he is on tv):   "You are so focused on being right and defending yourselves, you're letting your relationship go straight down the tubes," says Dr. Phil. "There comes a time when you have to stop blaming and judging each other. You have to ask yourself, 'What can I do today to make this relationship better?'"   "You have the ability to forgive," says Dr. Phil. "I'm not going to tell you that you need to be vulnerable and open your hearts to each other because neither one of you has demonstrated the worthiness to have the vulnerability of the other person. How much you trust the other is a function of how much you trust yourself to be able to handle what she might do."   "Hatred, bitterness, anger and resentment are pervasive," says Dr. Phil. "It's a stench that permeates every relationship you have. It affects every area of your life because it makes you draw back and not be who you really are...Two things I want you to hold on to are: number one, trust is up to you; and number two, forgiveness is up to you."   The valuable advice:   Dr. Phil tells "person A" and "person B" that he wants them to begin talking for an hour a week for the next month, and they are not allowed to discuss anything that has happened previously. "Start talking about things that don't matter," says Dr. Phil. " urlLink Because if you can't talk about things that don't matter, you'll never be able to talk about things that do ."   I have some relationships that this has worked brilliantly for, and for that I am very thankful.  See?  I didn't even need to pay for therapy.  :-)

      I personally wouldn't recomment this quiz, but this was my score, based (I'm sure) on my Catholic upbringing and my own adaptation thereof: Take the quiz:  urlLink "WHAT RELIGION BESTS SUITS YOU?"     True Christian  You are humble, gracious, and kind. You believe in the bible, but read it in its original language. Perhaps you're not a scholar, but you're not an armature either. You normally don't feel church is acceptable for your form of worship, and if anyone believes different from you, you might try to learn something from them.  I found a book (that shall remain nameless) that gave me a clearer definition of religion and how all religions tie together.   Christianity is not the only religion in the world that makes sense and there is room to accommodate the world's religions into the overall scheme of things.   Jesus and Mohammed can both be prophets.  We all worship the same God (well, those who do worship), regardless of his name.  When we leave this world, we go to a heaven-like place where we can choose to come back to learn various lessons or experience challenges first-hand, or we can choose to reside in heaven and make use of some good study time.  :-)  My beliefs in a nutshell.   All I can say is that these ideas make me feel better.  Thus ends my Saturday morning sermon.    PS  Satan worshipers are animal-killing idiots.  That should hopefully not offend anyone reading my site!

      First of all, yesterday was a day off for me.  In between taking Britty to the park, finding a really cool new book at the bookstore and eating lunch, I had time to watch Oprah, featuring Halle Berry.   Her new movie,  urlLink CatWoman  seems to be getting bad reviews, but looks like a good one to me.   She said that this was a good role for her at the time because she was working through the divorce with her husband who, do to a mental sickness, had several affairs on her.  She needed to feel in control, and this looks like a perfect role to make her feel that way.   It must be fulfilling to be able to take out your frustrations on stage and actually have your job benefit your personal life in such a dramatic way.  I have uploaded some pictures from the park, so check out the  urlLink Pics  link, if you like.  I hadn't realized they had added onto the Heartland Park.   Some of the high points include a veteran's memorial, a bridge that is meant to rust as part of it's eclectic nature and several beautiful floral gardens.   Also, after several weeks of high temps and high humidity, the weather was quite nice... mid 70's and hardly any humidity to speak of.  Today's song is by Rascall Flats, " urlLink These Days ".

      Well, the t-bucket nationals are in full force now, and the guys/ladies are headed down to the  urlLink Old Market  for an evening parade, which always tends to draw a lot of attention.   Earlier today, they headed down to Lincoln, NE for a Speedway Motors tour, but something terrible happened.  Evidently a semi driver became distracted at the cars and didn't notice a car (not a T) attempting to pull in front of him until just the last moment.  The driver swerved into a tbucket and the driver was life-flighted to the hospital.  His wife needed treatment, as well, but is close to being released.   The driver has a severely fractured leg (I hear 3 fractures) and they are watching his liver and spleen.   Also, his car is totalled except for a few parts, like the engine, that are still in tact.     This is dually sad, because this man has been so severely injured and also because these guys pour their hearts into their cars and his car is destroyed.  You can always rebuild a car, though, and I know that everyone is so grateful that he survived.  I have posted some  urlLink pics  for your review.   urlLink Thank God  for the blessings bestowed on us today.

      Well, I am sitting here waiting for my parents to arrive from VA Beach.  Currently, it is 10:49 pm and they arrived about an hour ago in KC, so I have about 2 or so hours to go.   I think I will wind up falling asleep in that amount of time.  Last night, I got up in the middle of the night to blow my nose and on my way back to bed, I did not see the corner of the hotel's armoir aiming for my right cheekbone.   I did notice it, however, when I heard the cracking sound and felt the subsequent pain thereof.    I have a bruise and a bump now, and it hurts (burns, actually).  I guess I'll live.  I had my digital cam with me today and had the opportunity to take a  urlLink few pics  along the way.   A couple of them involve rainbows.  Today I spent most of my time on this blog design, along with a few cleaning chores here and there, but mostly this design.  Have you ever tried to match up a wallpaper pattern on a wall before?  That's what this was like.  The center area where this text is had to be in just the right spot to match up with the stronger background.   Then I had to reinsert some of my toys, like the imood stamp and try for the longest time to import comments, to no avail, so I defaulted to Halo.   I like Halo's popup box anyway.   It is more user friendly.     Anyway, I have to go for now.  Have a great day!   Lisa  PS -  urlLink Sing, sing a song...

      ha!   I had an excellent birthday, even though I had to work a lot of the day.   I went to Senior Matias and had shrimp enchiladas, which were quite good.   I anticipated having a margarita, too, but although that sounded good, I opted for tea instead.     I drank like a fish in college, but I choose not to do too much of it anymore.   Just like I gave up smoking 12 years ago.  I didn't see benefits to it anymore, so I gave it up.   Frankly, it just scared me having to have a cigarette before I went to bed at night.  Now, I don't really have any negative habits at all!  Ok, that's a lie.     We all stayed at the Ramada Inn, where they are hosting the t-bucket nationals this year.     Brit and I went swimming while dad tried to repair his tbucket.  Nice time to have a broken down tbucket.   If you see a blue fancy car coming down the Missouri River, don't think anything of it!   I am learning more than I want to about car repair and some of the frustrations involved with that.  Anyway, apparently it rained like heck here last night... Streets were flooded and tbucket canopy's were being ripped to shreds.   A canopy normally protects the tbucket from getting wet.. It is like a camping canopy that you can use to keep out of the sun.   Well, some of them fell down and hopefully no  urlLink fancy cars  were scratched in the meantime.  Well, it's off to do some cleaning and other miscellaneous things.   Oh, greetings to those in the UK reading my site.   Thanks for stopping by, all of you!  As a token of my appreciation, here is the  urlLink song for the day.   Buenos Dias! Lisa

      Soon they will be gathering whole rooms of people, including animals, women and children.  "We'll kill one every odd hour unless you move 13 soldiers out of the Basra region," they will say.  Give me a break.  Stop the insanity, as Susan Powder would say. Soon maybe they will kidnap their own terrorist friends and just   say   that they are hostages.  That would be nifty, then.  We could just ignore them and let them do what they want.  Sorry if this offends anyone, but I am tired of terrorists and their strategies to "help Iraq".  Shock and awe... that's what it is.   Do you think they will come up with something new eventually?   I don't mean to be insensitive, but these reports are getting less shocking, although I would not wish decapitation on anyone.  Are they hoping the repetition will drive someone mad and then someone will want to do something effective about it?  From CNN:                                           A militant group in Iraq holding      six truckers hostage said one man     will be beheaded every three days     unless their demands are met. The     six hostages -- two from Kenya,       three from India and one from Egypt   -- work for a Kuwaiti firm. The       kidnappers demanded that the          companies or countries the men are    affiliated with pull their            personnel from Iraq."

      I wonder how many times Monday will come around in my lifetime, and how many of those will involve actually having to wake up and go to work.   A lot depends, of course, on how long I live, which I don't imagine should be long.  Kidding, of course, but I do not want to live to the ripe-old age of 95, or there-a-bouts.   I could certainly see a lot in that length of time, but I have doubts as to whether my mind would be sharp that long.   When I'm alive, I want to be cognizant of the world around me and the people that I adore.  But I'm off on a track different than I intended.  Today was the average Monday.   No conflicts to speak of, but people just seemed incredibly dumb today.   I'm speaking of some of the people I had to talk to in order to resolve problems for.   I can understand the need for direction, but when someone calls and they have no idea how to operate the internet...   Of course, my overabundance of patience sets in and I pretend that I am speaking to my grandmother, but inside I just can't believe what I'm hearing.   Computers are not rocket science, especially if you sit down and attempt to use one for any time at all.   My mom, who swore off computers some time ago, is shopping all over the world via the Internet.  What is wrong with people??   Out of all the things you could do on a computer, surfing is by far the easiest thing.  Overall, the day went fast, though, and I am ready for tomorrow because that means I am just one day closer to Thursday, when I have the day off, and also Friday... when I have the day off.   Parents are coming... must clean!  Song for the day...    Brandy (of all people!)   urlLink "What About Us?"

        FAMILY AND LOCATION    I am one of three children,  me being the oldest .&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two brothers named John and Chris who are both married and with children (5 and 1, respectively), both with great wives.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother Chris is a technical support person and my brother John is an ER doctor.&nbsp; One sister-in-law works at a stock brokerage and one works at home (with 5 kids, she'd better!)&nbsp; :-)  My parents live in  urlLink VA Beach , home of the infamous  urlLink Blues at the Beach festival &nbsp;and mounds and mounds of&nbsp; urlLink seafood  (my favorite is ocean scallops!).&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad works as a project manager for the   Navy   (he is a civilian).&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom works in sales.  My parents hailed from a   small town of about 1,000 people called Virden, IL  , which I love, mostly because going there meant that I would see my grandparents and my other nearby relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of them are gone now, except for one grandma (we'll call her the ornery one) that is in a nursing home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Virden is close to Springfield, which is famous for the  urlLink horseshoe sandwich. &nbsp;  &nbsp; I didn't realize until today that this was a Springfield specialty.&nbsp; I dined on these at the Virden Cafe sometimes when I visited my grandparents.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I was   born in Peoria, IL  , but I have been in Omaha so long that I'm starting to think of this as my hometown (but I am not a native Nebraskan... don't get on my bad side!).&nbsp; I left Peoria at 2 and arrived in&nbsp;Omaha when&nbsp;my dad graduated from&nbsp;graduate school&nbsp;and became a full-fledged engineer.  Nebraska is more famous for  urlLink Runza Sandwiches  and  urlLink Omaha Steaks .    I lived in Omaha most of the way through school  , except for 2 years that we lived in Council Bluffs, which I consider to be "CrappyLand".&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we lived was fine, but I have a strong aversion to Iowa for some unknown reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I guess it is not as cosmopolitan as Omaha.&nbsp;&nbsp;   For you New Yorkers, you just had a good laugh.&nbsp; Omaha... cosmopolitan... ha!&nbsp;&nbsp; But the city is getting better and bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; Cher comes here now.&nbsp; :-)    SCHOOL    In grade school and high school, I was a  summer school junkie .&nbsp;&nbsp; I took language classes (spanish, german &amp; french), art classes and driver's ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also took swimming classes every day of the summer, which I loved.  I went to  college for 3 years  but couldn't decide what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to take a full-time job instead and see what having money was like.  I lived in Dallas for a semester while I went to  North Texas State University , where I also taught driver's ed only to get instate tuition rates. :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dallas is a dangerous place... glass buildings that can make you melt into the pavement in the summer and very large shopping malls.&nbsp;&nbsp;  They drive fast, too , but that is a good thing.    WORK    My first job out of college was in a   mail room ,  sorting and delivering&nbsp;mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived at home, so I didn't care that I didn't make much money.  My second job was a   file clerk  , where I was bored to tears, but learned a lot about life insurance policies, since that is what I filed and I read as I went along.  My third job was a   medicare supplemental claims payer   (quite a jump, huh?).&nbsp;&nbsp; That was interesting..&nbsp; I learned to communicate in writing and over the phone with insured people and doctor's offices.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can now calculate 20% of any figure in my head.  I left that company after a year (all three jobs were within a year) and went to another insurance company where I initially typed out   insurance contracts   on a typewriter, until we got computers and&nbsp;started  desktop publishing .&nbsp;&nbsp; I did this job for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;    My manager was a total ass.   &nbsp;&nbsp; (I swear this man's picture is in the dictionary)&nbsp; I started becoming the go-to person when something went wrong on computers.  My technical support person at work decided to take another job and recommended me for her job.&nbsp; And I got it.&nbsp; Hoorah!&nbsp;&nbsp;   I ascended from hell   into the realm of technical support with no degree and no formal training.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took several Access programming classes for my job and began to explore Lotus Notes programming.  After 2 years,  I graduated to IS , where I worked on a level 2 help desk that supported the whole company (over  6,000  customers were involved) and left the little group that loved and adored me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you become an IS person, the lay people sometimes think you are too smart, so people are going from "oh,we just adore you!" to " Why is IS so stupid? ".&nbsp;&nbsp; Some IS people act like they are too smart or too good to support anyone, although my knack is&nbsp;to try&nbsp;to see things from the "technically challeged" point-of-view (not that I am technically challenged... I can just see their viewpoint)  After 2 years of working level 2,  I decided to move into level 1 work , which I enjoy immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp; By that, I mean if I have to go to work to begin with, this is not such a bad place to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the day,   I take incoming technical phone calls  , do some research, try to promote world peace and divide subatomic particles in my cubicle.&nbsp;  So far, no luck with the particles or the peace thing.     OTHER SEMI-ENTERTAINING INFORMATION    Some of my&nbsp;interests include  writing ,  music , learning, cooking,   animals  ,&nbsp;architecture, antiques (looking at them, not buying them)   photography  , communicating with people,  swimming , some&nbsp;minor sewing and  geeky computer things .&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak a small amount of  Spanish  and understand quite a bit of it (if you're spanish-speaking and I can't figure out what you're saying, there are many online translation services I can get to quickly!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I like  volleyball  and used to play on a league, but not anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned to bowl, but I'm really bad at it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to like watching basketball when Jordan played for the Bulls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I don't really care about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's about the extent of my sports interests.  I don't know why, but I&nbsp;tend to be interested in   military life and history   as well.  I cannot take   naps   in the afternoon.&nbsp; They make me too groggy for the rest of the day.&nbsp; I would rather fall asleep at 8:30pm than take an afternoon nap.  I took  judo  for a couple of months when I was a kid until some stupid boy started cursing at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided it wasn't worth it anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was always getting the wind knocked out of me anyway.  I am   allergic   to  urlLink cats , although I own one, and several other  green things  that live outside, like certain trees, hay, bluegrass and pollen (pollen is not green, by the way).  I do   not   like  spiders and most bugs , although I think some of those camel spiders are large enough to be small dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would consider leashing one and calling it a pet... you know... if I had LOST my  MIND  or something!&nbsp;      I believe it is bad luck to crush a cricket.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my only real superstition.     TV :&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Morning America, The Bachelor/Bachelorette, American Idol, Sex and the City, Friends, 6 Feet Under,  East Coast Choppers , Pimp My Ride, As the World Turns, Guiding Light,  Dr. Phil  and Oprah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh... Spongebob Squarepants and Fairly Odd Parents (sometimes against my will).&nbsp;   I believe in   astrology   for the purposes of determining likely compatability, but  not  the daily "how's my day gonna go?" stuff.&nbsp; I am a  urlLink  moonchild  , so I get along with all    moonchildren, capricorns, aquarians, pisces, leos, virgos and scorpios   .&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest I have to adapt to.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;   I  get along with most people ... but some of them take more study than others.&nbsp;&nbsp; My favorites are the ones that are  straightforward  and  easy-going/sense of humor.&nbsp;       THE END   That's about all there is, in a nutshell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope I didn't bore anyone to tears.&nbsp;   See ya later!

        some man called my house at 7 this morning (Saturday morning) to discuss the " urlLink t-bucket nationals " and how to become registered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad my child can sleep through just about anything (well, she is up now..)&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is cool that the word is getting out about them and that people want to come, but 7am is a little early.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least I was awake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am vaguely familiar with the man running this event, but unfortunately he has not left me with any information about it.   urlLink http://www.dioramarama.com/kmel/ &nbsp;&nbsp; This is pretty cool (seriously).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a wannabe craft person, and although I made all of the flowers (my first project, mind you) for my stepdaughter's wedding, I have not been able to get the hang of knitting/crocheting.&nbsp; I need professional lessons someday when I can pry myself away from a computer.  last night my blog had all kinds of hits from&nbsp;foreign countries&nbsp;which is  pretty cool to me .&nbsp; Thanks for stopping by.  I found this cool  urlLink video  for today.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should land on a Hoobastank video.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Launch goes wherever the heck it wants.&nbsp;&nbsp; My problem with music is that I know what I like when I hear it, but the radio goofs here never tell you who is singing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you ask me what groups I like, I have no freakin' idea.  I got a note from&nbsp;a fellow  urlLink blogger &nbsp;yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to keep it and I will be able to say "I knew her when" she was a budding (ok, accomplished)&nbsp;chronologist.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certain blogs you cannot miss, and hers is one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is truly interesting.  My daughter actually helped me at the grocery store and helped me to carry groceries from the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been dubbed "My Good Helper".&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Britty!   Today's activities involve finishing painting the living room, which looks quite good so far, thank you, and cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents arrive next week from Virginia Beach and you may know that I've been a little preoccupied with writing lately.  Have an awesome day wherever you are!

      Martha Stewart was sentenced to 5 months in jail and 2 years of probation, plus $30,000 for a loss avoidance of $51,000 by dumping ImClone stock because her broker supposedly has a big mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, $51,000 compared to her net worth is a relatively small amount.&nbsp; Second, I have a hard time believing there was any wrong doing on Martha's part (because I KNOW her dammit... she makes all of my Christmas cookies) and thirdly, I think her status got her more attention this time than she deserved.  Eventually, I believe there will be some sort of appeal granted and she will never do any time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine Mike Tyson in jail, but not Martha Stewart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The broker, yes; her no.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her broker sounds like some kind of idiot anyway, along with that clerk or whatever he was... the druggie.. &nbsp; I am not a mindless Martha fan like some people, but... come on... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      about blogs is that you cannot have a two-way conversation by reading a blog, no matter how interesting the topic or the person who is&nbsp;writing it&nbsp;is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa's painfully obvious realization for the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a way, I think it is sad that we have relegated ourselves to essentially "talking to ourselves" and I am wondering why that is.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is just my thought today.&nbsp; Maybe I am in a chatty mood for some reason.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If you are stopping by, feel free to make post comments if they occur to you&nbsp;or post an email by clicking on the little logo, even if it's just to say "Hi, your blog is so terribly interesting, I could not get through the day without it". (ok, that is just my&nbsp;wierd sense of humour. )&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  The song du jour is actually a  urlLink video .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot go wrong with Hootie (and no, I did not say Hooters).&nbsp; &nbsp;  Have a ridiculously cool day..

       It was a long day at work.&nbsp; Well, some of it went fast thanks to one of our firewalls being a tad flightly.&nbsp; When you have to be at work at 6am (especially on little sleep), it's nice to have the network partially functional, at least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I have been thinking about the song for the day.&nbsp; At first, I was starting to think I would not have one, BUT on the way home, I decided I deserved some new music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was basically because what I had on hand was annoying the heck out of me and just not hitting me right.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, this is where I found today's song, Josh Kelley's " urlLink Amazing ".&nbsp; I have tomorrow's song, too, but you can't see it yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I must say that probably for the last year, I've been kind of lost in external activities.. stressful ones, like studying for tests and other various things I don't really care to mention or really think about (nothing drastic, just stressful).&nbsp;&nbsp; For awhile, I felt like I was drowning a little bit in all of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the last big thing is over with, I am finding little bits and pieces of my real self that I didn't realize were missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can thank music for that mostly, but also some of the blogs I've been perusing (perhaps a little too frequently).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems a little redundant to blog about blogs, but doing some reading from other people is prompting me to enjoy writing my own, and that's a great thing.&nbsp; And I guess part of it is being able to feel free to do some things I actually enjoy instead of worrying and reading boring things.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess this is what people say when a  huge weight has been lifted off their shoulders, yes? &nbsp;&nbsp; If I can just get some sleep, I will be fine.    &nbsp;  Speaking of birthdays, my parents have sent me 9 iris bulbs to plant for my birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I love plants and flowers in the yard, it's about 300 degrees and humid outside (expecting strong thunderstorms tonight, as well) so I'm not overly inclined to plant them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow when the ground is all mushy from the "strong thunderstorms".&nbsp;   I see that Blogger has some new changes, like this nifty window I am typing in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't figured out the upload feature yet, like what am I supposed to type in the ftp window.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can think of things to type there, but what is the correct thing?  Britty is writing a letter to grandma.&nbsp; It says, "Dear Grandma, Thanks for having me, Love Britty".&nbsp;&nbsp; One she wrote for the dog says, "Dear Aunt Sarah, Thank you for having me, Love Ginger."&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect we worked on writing letters at school today.&nbsp; As Brit would say, "Good deal!"&nbsp; (I'm working on that, too)   As one of my brothers would say, "ta ta for now", it's off to the kitchen for non-1974 weight watcher recipes.&nbsp;

      It is not right to have to get up at 4:30 to go to work.   On the good side, I got to see the sunrise when I walked into work today.  Also, I will get to leave at 2:30, which will be nice.  I think I have too much patience.   Dad had to get Brit ready for school today and she could not locate her shoes.   Like mother; like daughter, only I am used to looking for stuff that I misplaced and dad always knows where his stuff is.   We have to develop a more organized plan.  More when I wake up...   Have a most excellent day!

      ... with the new design!   Sorry if you thought this was going to be a mushy post!  It took me a couple hours and some code-swiping and some graphical adjustments in Photoshop to do, but I managed in about 2.5 hours (well, dinner and a bath for the little kid fit in there, too).  I have spent too much time coding this week.  I am glad to be done with it.  Today, I had lunch with a good friend of mine, Lori.  When I lunch with one of my girlfriends, it reminds me of how much I miss talking to "the girls".   Most of my team at work is male, except for my supervisor, so I am used to having brother-like people around all day, but not many sister-type people.  When my friend(s) and I get together, we're able to relate on female levels, talk about the men in our lives (there are husbands, fathers, brothers and friends) and it's fun.   I never had an actual sister, but there are several people I would be willing to adopt.    This was not too bad a day at work, either.  I was dreading coming in this week because this is the first full week I've had in awhile, thanks to the financial exam a couple weeks ago and thanks to the fourth of July last week.  Taking technical questions over the phone is not so bad.   When I worked level 2 work, I got to choose when I would get ahold of people to resolve problems.   At level 1, the customers are doing the choosing, which alleviates any chance I have at procrastinating, which is good.  Also, I always thought level 1 would be easy, but it's not.  Level 2 gave me a chance to look a question over and do research.   At level 1, I am listening and researching/analysing at the same time.   But at level 1, we're getting all of the really easy calls mixed in with the complex ones, whereas it was only complex ones before.  It's less frustrating in that way.  I've been doing the level 1 work for 2 years now and surprisingly enough, it seems to be a good fit.  I have to admit that since I was able to get through my 12 pages of promotion paperwork, I feel like my brain has been on holiday.   I am just taking a mental break, I guess, at least as far as work is concerned.   After the last year, I could really use some R&R, preferably a large vacation, but I may have to just settle for my current "virtual vacation".  Speaking of work, I have to be there at 6am tomorrow, so I'd better get going!  I pulled out one of my old, old CD's today, "Smooth Grooves" and decided to start posting a song of the day, when I can come up with one.   Here is today's:   urlLink What You Won't Do for Love - Bobby Caldwell   Have a great day!     PS.  Check out the cool new photo link!

      No... I can't think of any! I think I would have to find a gun or something if I saw one of those. Or my mom would say, "A big can of hairspray", since that is how I used to disable spiders when I was in high school. Hey, it slows them down. Well, maybe not gargantuan spiders, but (like I said), a gun would do. Although they do seem to think of some clever remarks sometimes. (inside joke... you'd have to be there)   Ok, I thought of one thing.. People are making fun of you or annoying you.. You hand them a camel spider. They shut up (or drop dead...one of those).   Have a good day!!

      ... I want to comment about politics or anti-Americanism, but I just think it would tick people off.   But I feel compelled today..  I was on the blog of some woman living in Jordan (not a Jordanian, btw) who, to pass time, thought she would purchase some American history books.   I thought, hoo-rah.. someone wants to read about our history.   That didn't last very long.  Evidently, we are a country full of no-mind people who could never elect anyone who would start countless wars, right after the other, for no apparent reason.  First of all, if you are going to read, read it all:  the acts AND the reasons for the acts.  Secondly, pick an author who knows what they are talking about.  I suspect she did not pick an American author or if she did, the author was not providing very thorough information. Thirdly, my patriotism is showing, but I will always be inclined to back the US, although there are some things I may not always agree with.  When those situations come along, if they are important to me, I can voice my opinion without fear.  Also, if we can't learn from or learn to laugh at our mistakes, we've got a problem.     No place in the world is perfect, but at least no one is jailing me for voicing an opinion or taking me away from my family, never to be heard from again.   If you're looking for perfectionism somewhere, good luck... you will have to wait awhile.

      This is probably not a good mom thing to do.   Last night there was a shortage of little kid PJ's due to our laundry person (my husband)  :-) being at a car show all day instead of doing the laundry.  So I put Britty in one of her casual dresses and it all worked out the same.     My daughter, like me, is NOT a morning person (only she doesn't get coffee wheras I do!).  Everyday, we have to pry her out of bed.  One day when he was feeling especially onery, "dad" got out the squirt bottle and spritzed her awake.  She loves water, so she thought that was funny.   Anyway, she woke up crabby as hell today and wanted to keep the dress on that she wore to bed.  It was polyester, so it wasn't wrinkled or anything.  It wasn't dirty or stinky, so avoid a fight, I just sent her to preschool in it.    My question is, is that all so bad?   What may be even worse is if we consider making that a habit.  :-)   (which we won't... although it does speed up morning dressing dramatically..)  Hmm... maybe I should consider that for myself.

      The other day at work, someone made a comment that he didn't know why people would want to blog. Obviously, people blog for different reasons. Some people are begging to have their blog read so that people can read what they're writing about. Obviously "is anyone even reading this" throughout a blog is pretty boring. I personally do not care if anyone reads my blog, although I have given people I know a link so that they can see a little bit about what I'm thinking. I think the best blogs are the ones where people are not begging to be read. I am here just to write things down in the hope of becoming a better writer and document my life a little bit... for myself.   I think blogs can bring you into someone else's life and situations anonymously. It is interesting to imagine being a soldier in Iraq, although I know it has a lot of downpoints (like the heat!). It is interesting still. It is evident that you need skill and a strong sense of humour to get through that! It is interesting to see the writing of a young girl in Iraq watching the world around her (see the link for "A Star from Mosul"). You know she is not tainted by the media. She is just being herself. And when you look at the Vice President of Iran's blog, you see pictures of his daughter (approximately 2) shying away from the President of Iran. It is not that she is afraid because he is the President of Iran. It is that she is 2 and that is what 2 year olds do. Regular people. Extraordinary missions.   By the way, I am sure the Premises and Star of Mosul (and maybe the Vice President of Iran) authors wake up every morning and think, "this was not a dream afterall" and "what's going to happen today and how can I prepare myself for that". Some of them are probably wondering if it's going to be below 115 degrees that day (how miserable!) It makes me realize how really small some of my problems are.   The thing is that we are given a gift when someone is willing to show their inner feelings or just show themselves through their writing. When you write a blog, you do not know who is reading, or you assume no one is reading, so you can be yourself and be honest without too much fear of judgement or criticism. When you read my blog, you see a piece of me. Whether that is important to anyone or not remains to be seen, but the only thing that really matters to me is that it's important to me. You know what I mean.

      I have a new car that is about 2 1/2 weeks old.   Already it is on it's second trip to the glass shop to get the windshield repaired because rocks on the Interstate are aiming for my windshield.   Yesterday, I was driving to work and was not even around any other vehicle when one hit my windshield and made a mark about the size of a dime.   Either there are too many freaking rocks, or my windshield is faulty in some way.   If it happens again, I intend to call Hyundai and give them a piece of my mind.   Can you say "shatter resistant glass"?     We have a couple of new rules in our house to contribute to some type of order.   For a long time, since we only have one small child in residence, we have allowed her to take as long as she wants to eat dinner and go to bed "whenever".  Yesterday, after some reading on the Internet and a gentle mention from my husband, it occurred to me that we actually have no order whatsoever in our house.    An 8:30 bedtime was immediately imposed, but it is so cool.    I told her it was time to go to bed last night and she said she wanted to sleep in the living room where we were.   I said, "Come on... Mommy will read you a book.." and she literally ran to her bedroom.   She loves to read (and be read to) and really I haven't made the time I should be making to read to her.  After I am done reading a book, she starts over from the beginning and tells the story herself according to how she remembers it and what the pictures look like.   Last nights story was "But Not the Hippopotamus", one of my personal favorites.  The other thing we are disciplining ourselves on is eating dinner at the dinner table.  This eliminates Britty's sometimes 2 hour dinnertime in front of the tv.  :-) We don't leave until everyone is finished.  I'm not sure how long that will last, but it allows for better focus on the task at hand, and in the long run it may improve focus for other tasks as well.     Plus it cuts down her TV time.    She learns some things from TV, but we don't want it to be an all-day event.  There are more educational things to do.

      How about we gather together all of the terrorists and the Nigerian mail scam artists and plant them together on one uninhabited island and let them have at it?  Just an idea.  Dear Osama - I am trapped in Nigeria with $10M US dollars.  I will give you a large sum of my money ($2M US Dollars) if you just give me your current coordinates.  I will deliver the money directly to you via my personal B-52 Stratofortress.   Do not concern yourself with the missles attached.  They are just nuclear weapons stuffed with your money.   We are looking forward to working closely with you.   Please respond as soon as you are able, as we have many, many people hoping for this money.  Dr. Billy Bob Quasimontu

      Yesterday, Britty discovered the difference between the viability of glass vs. plastic cups on the ceramic tile floor in the kitchen.   I have made a new rule:   No more glass-constructed glasses for Britty until she is old enough to not jump up and down with them and allow them to slip out of her hands.   Everyone has accidents and I'm ok with that, but it's not fun to clean up.  I always manage to get cut and there's always some little piece I find on the floor weeks later, no matter how carefull I have been to clean it up.  3 1/2 year olds and glass do not mix.  The End.  :-)  On another note, I love the new design of my blog site, although I have some work to do on it, like updating links, etc.   I am anxious to redesign my website as well with some templates I was given yesterday that are pretty cool.   Stay tuned..

      First of all, I did not choose Omaha.  Omaha chose me.   Rather, my parents chose Omaha for me.   They chose it, waited for me to get married and then moved away!  Well, I'm sure they didn't do that intentionally.   For a long time, I have felt stuck here, though, but my ATTITUDE is improving somewhat.   My main concern right now is property taxes and how they keep going up.  But the city itself is really booming now.   We have a new conference center (Qwest Center), the interstate is improved, the zoo gets something major and new every year, and things don't look so dreary as they did before we moved.  Here are a few links for sites around town:   urlLink Qwest Center   urlLink The Omaha Channel   urlLink AMC Oakview Theater   urlLink Historic Orpheum Theater   urlLink Omaha Zoo   urlLink Rosenblatt Stadium   urlLink The Omaha Riverfront - Missouri River   urlLink The Old Market Area   Take a look around!

      Independence Day always brings a mixed bag of issues.   It is cool to watch fireworks on the 4th of July.   It is not cool when your animals are frightened by them.   I sat outside with Ted, our chow, until 11:30 trying to calm him.   He was pretty scared..   At 11:30, I was just too tired to do it anymore.  My golden retriever would not go outside to go to the bathroom for anything.  Thankfully, it is over with now (well, until the neighbors run out of fireworks).  I spent a lot of my day yesterday revising my website:  brittysgarden.com    I am waiting for a few templates to be sent to me and there may be more changes.  I like web design, but once you get started, it's hard to stop.     Yesterday afternoon, I bought Britty a $11 pool (91,520.23 Iranian Rials)  :-) at Osco Drug.  It is a sorry looking pool, but she likes it.   The problem is that our backyard is not level.   It is enough for her to jump in and have fun with, and I guess that is all that matters.  Today is July 5 and it's gloomy and rainy-looking outside.   I was hoping to get out of the house for awhile.. take a walk in the park or something.    I know it will be hard to return to work tomorrow.   It is not that I don't like my work, really, although sometimes it gets to me.  It is just that, in general, I have a hard time figuring some people out.   I wish everything could be exactly as it looks... I would like to be on the "what you see is what you get" plan, but people are unfortunately more complex than that.  I am finding that I don't have too much time or energy for that anymore.  This is most of the reason why, in a crowded room, I have a tendency to stand back and assess the people and the situation to determine my comfort level.   If I am not comfortable, this "cancer girl" wants to crawl back into her shell and wait for a change of situation.   As you were.

      From CNN:  Americans marked the 228th birthday of the United States on Sunday with a solemn cornerstone laying ceremony at the site of the World Trade Center, as well as with parades and fireworks scheduled for later in the day nationwide.  In an emotional ceremony, New York laid the cornerstone of the new Freedom Tower, promising it will reclaim the city's skyline, altered after the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001.  "Today is indeed a momentous day," said Gov. George Pataki at the ceremony to break ground for what is expected to be the tallest skyscraper in the world. The new Freedom Tower will stand where the World Trade Center towers once stood.  "Today we take 20 tons of Adirondack granite -- the bedrock of our state -- and place it as the foundation, the bedrock of a new symbol of American strength and confidence," Pataki said. "Today, we lay the cornerstone for a new symbol of this city and this country and of our resolve in the face of terror."  An inscription on the cornerstone reads, "To honor and remember those who lost their lives on September 11th, 2001 and as a tribute to the enduring spirit of freedom -- July Fourth 2004."  Freedom Tower is designed to be 1,776 feet tall -- to mark the year of American independence from Great Britain. It's scheduled to be finished in 2008.  Independence Day took a disappointing turn for some residents of Charleston, West Virginia. A mechanical problem on Air Force One forced President Bush to cancel a planned stop at a church there.  Officials discovered a problem with a start valve on the left engine of the plane after the president had boarded in Hagerstown, Maryland.  The C-32, a military version of the commercial 757, never taxied. Officials said a new plane was flown in from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to ferry the president to West Virginia, where he is scheduled to celebrate the holiday at a rally later in the day in Charleston.   urlLink   urlLink

      Yesterday I was rummaging through information on the Internet and happened upon this site, http://www.webnevesht.com/en/.    Blogging has certainly touched many areas of the world.   For example, if you go to the link above, you will see the blog for the vice president of Iran.   Interestingly enough, the posts are not all political, although there are a few mixed in, but the author has been careful to allow himself to show through.   In a world where the middle east is sometimes a mystery to me, it is enlightening to see things through the eyes of someone living in Iran.   http://www.iranchamber.com/ shows some photographs and recipes, among other things, of Iran.    I cannot imagine seeing this ornate architecture for myself.   Indeed, I probably never will, but it seems like quite an interesting mixture of history and today.   Some of the structures that exist there, I would never imagine existing or being thought of in the US.    I imagine that somewhere in my long lineage of being created and recreated, I must have been an architect.  I love it, especially if it is old and historic.  Another proof of my theory.. people are just people in the middle east:  http://mahmood.tv/index.php/blog/  Blogging is certainly opening my eyes.   Never count on the media (newspapers and TV) to help you define your opinion of people and places.  Use your own eyes to see for yourself.

      I think my HS318 Intro to Finance and Insurance exam was my worst nightmare.   Ok, maybe I am exaggerating, but it was a pain in the butt, that's for sure.   2 years ago I had this bright idea that insurance was my main interest and I should try to do something with it.   I studied for a year (off and on) and then took the test on the last possible allowable day.    Obviously, I hadn't studied enough because I failed (but only by a few points).   Now it's "free retake time" so that I don't have to repay Mutual the $500 they paid American College for me to pass successfully.    Another year later, I studied my butt off, took the test on the last possible day, and PASSED!   I was elated, to say the least.   Not only do I not like to part with money over my own failures, but I didn't have $500 to part with.   For a few days, I was just happy to have passed the test.  But I'm finding little things now... like I'll run across notes for the test and BOOKS for the test and throw them immediately into the trash.   My calculator is listed on ebay for sale.    I am able to look at books I would read for pleasure now and not feel guilty about wanting to pick them up and read them.  All in all, I'm glad the test is over.   It was hard (and somewhat boring).  I learned some things, but some of it was not important enough for me to remember.    I do not want to take any more tests for a long, long time!!

      Today, I went into Office Depot looking for a shredder.  Not finding one I liked (like this is a difficult choice), I checked to see what their printer cartridge prices were and noticed the low, low prices on HP printers.   I've always said that it is cheaper to toss out your printer when your cartridges are empty than to replace the cartridges.  Now I am going to practice what I preach.  I went across the street to  urlLink Nebraska Furniture Mart  with my handy-dandy NFM account card and found a  urlLink printer  I really like.  After the rebate, it was around $95, just a little more than my  urlLink HP Photsmart 1000 printer  cartridges cost to replace.   The cool part is that it's an all-in-one, meaning it scans, it copies, it prints in color.  I can hook my camera up to it, I can send any  urlLink scan or pic  from it without even saving it on my machine.. it just dumps it into a new e-mail message.  I can get rid of the Photosmart 1000 and my old scanner and have this one thing instead.     The cartridges are  urlLink super   urlLink cheap  to replace with this one.   Also, the resolution is higher and the pps rate is higher than the old one, and the old one is just 2 years old.   HP has even phased out the 1000, mostly, I imagine, because the method of putting in a camera smartcard utilizes a smartcard that no one really uses anymore.  Fortunately, my Olympus that worked with this printer drowned in the Atlantic ocean last year as I quickly determined my daughter wandering toward the ocean required two hands.  :-)  Anyway... it's no overly technical item, but it's kind of cool to have.  See ya.. Lisa

      I was up just before bedtime reading the site about people who have been  urlLink executed  and why (sorry  urlLink Kate ), and then everything that happened after that was kind of spooky.   I woke up this morning at 3 because the house alarm was beeping.   Who knows what set it off.    It was not a solid alarm, so not a big thing... but there was something it didn't like, evidently.  (i was laying in bed thinking, "Thank God we have a golden retriever so if anyone breaks in here, Ginger will have a new friend to play with!" Ummm... what happened to my pit bull, anyway?)  Also, the cable, phone and internet were all down at that time at 3am, which kinda freaked me out (what if my family was trying to call me in an emergency?),  even if they are all provided by the same company.  I would never expect my phone to be unavailable for any reason, but I guess it can be.   When I finally got up at 4:30 (I am working the early shift today), I let my dog out to go to the bathroom and locked the screen door just in case some jerk tried to break in and do something stupid  (they will never get through the lock, but the screen might be a different story).  I am a believer in the death penalty now, at least.    Either put them to death or put them all together in one small room and let them have at it. Also, I have sworn off the "dead man eating" site for the day (it is funny what tricks your mind can play with you), although it was interesting to see them ordering 12 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, 6 2-liter bottles of coke and 3 apple pies.  I guess if all you have to do is eat and then die, getting a bunch of food to eat all day seems like as good a plan as any.  On a happier note, I want to thank the people for whom I have pages linked on this page.   I read all of these blogs on a regular basis and they all keep me interested and entertained; always thoughtful.  In the end, you are making me a better writer and forcing me to think about things I would not normally come up with on my own.   I like your blogs for entirely different reasons.   Some of them are political and I feel I need to expand my horizons in that way and be aware of what is  urlLink happening  in the rest of the world.    I am learning to think outside the " urlLink US box " and see perspectives from  urlLink across the globe .    Others remind me of where I have  urlLink been  and I get a chance to live vicariously (again) through your writing.   Some of you are doing  urlLink outstanding things ... fighting a  urlLink war ...  urlLink addressing the news  as it happens..  urlLink writing opinions  about important  urlLink changes  going on in the world. Some of you are  urlLink literary   urlLink pros .   Some of you are  urlLink moms  that I can definitely relate to.  I even ran into someone that shares my same  urlLink birthday  (what are the chances of that?)  All of you seem to be nice, caring, articulate people.   Blogging is not only fun, it is an interesting way to expand your world.  So, welcome to this blog, and don't be afraid to leave your mark if you so choose.  Have an excellent (safe) day!

      I think I look extra smart when I grab my coworker's programming books and put them on my desk.   Today, my strange visitor is "Perl in a Nutshell". "Lisa, what did you learn about Perl programming today?"  "Umm .... nothing... this is just a decoration".   Did you ever notice how all programming kinda looks the same?  Actually, I do some HTML and CSS scripting.  That is about the extent of it.    I can hand code HTML, but sometimes have to use Frontpage if I need something complex and need help with the coding.  :-)  Why am I only speaking with people in Kentucky today?    They tend to have a little more time to talk on the phone than I am willing to accept.    Oh well.   I get paid for it, at least!    I keep having to say that to myself.   It is my motivation for getting up and driving to work at 6:30am.  Sorry if anyone reading this is from Kentucky.   I just ran into a few of the slowest-talking people in your state today, is all.

      This weekend, between cleaning, some light shopping, socializing with my step-daughter and her husband, starting a "sew Britty some jeans" project and other miscellany, I took the time to pry myself away from my blog design/reading and see bits and pieces of a couple of TV movies.     I am finding I can no longer make myself sit down and watch TV, so I made a point of at least trying to relax that way somewhat (especially while Brit was napping).  The first was " urlLink Not Without My Daughter " with Sally Fields. That title may make some of you cringe right away.  It is supposed to be a true story, and from reading the comments on the  link, it seems like it got mixed reviews.  One woman who was in Iran says it is realistic while others feel it is a slam against Iran and Muslims (I'm sure it has a western twist on it, but how out of line is it?).  I have an open mind about Iran, mostly because I haven't cluttered it with anything anti-Iran and I kind of take history with an open mind these days. I have done some reading that places like Saudi Arabia (I can't remember where I read this...somewhere on the Internet) allow very few (what we consider) "freedoms" for women, like going out of the house without being escorted by a husband or male relative, voting, driving, being without their head and body covered, etc.   I'm sure the women in this region may be accustomed to this, but it seems strange and condescending for some of the rest of the world.   I guess this does not make it wrong or right, unless you are there and you don't like it.   I can't imagine being constrained in that way.   I would be interested to know if anyone has seen this movie and whether or not they consider it realistic.  The other movie was " urlLink Last Dance " with Sharon Stone and Peter Gallagher.  It was about a woman on death row awaiting her near approaching execution.  I have to say that I have thought about the death penalty many times, but cannot come to a conclusion about how I feel about it.   In Nebraska, we use the electric chair (sparingly) and that seems barbaric.   While some people should probably deserve the death penalty, I believe the chair is barbaric... not because someone who murders horrendously does not deserve barbarity, but because I think an ethical society should not lower itself intentionally to barbarism.   The lethal injection method seems more humane.    If someone murdered one of my friends or family and wasn't sorry about it, I believe I would actively support their execution regardless of the circumstances of the murderer's life.    However, it is hard to overlook the humanity of the situation and make a decision about whether it is my right to decide if a person should die.   I guess I am just not comfortable taking that sort of decision unless it affects me directly. There is always a part of me that objects to inhumanity of any kind,whether it is someone being killed by a ruthless person or someone being killed because we think he/she deserves it.  Hopefully, I have not depressed anyone.  Have a great day! Lisa  UpDAte:  After reading this  urlLink website , I decided that I am, in fact, for the death penalty.   I can't believe what some people do.

      I think I am more of a Cancer than a Leo, but someone just brought to my attention that I could be a mixture of both.  (I am still more Cancer)  :-P    Cancer/Leo July 19 to July 23  Cancer is the fourth sign of the Zodiac; Leo is the fifth. Those born on the Cancer/Leo cusp have the vitality and ambition to be successful in their creative endeavors. Creativity is one of their keywords, and their caring nature ensures that the benefits of their imaginative powers help others. Cancer/Leos turn to nurturing the family group and take pride in their warm hospitality. They are emotional and traditional, interested in heredity and ancestors. Cancer/Leos can be prominent on stage and in film, as their natural ability to act and their flamboyance and love of attention make them naturals at fame.   The astrological symbol of Cancer is the Crab; for Leo, it's the Lion.  Cancer/Leos go through life with a strong shell around them that is not easily broken.  However, Cancer/Leos are the  first to express emotion  in any given situation -- the first to laugh and the first to tears. In this way, the Cancerian influence exemplifies the cardinal quality assigned to it. They also have a  strong ability to see their projects through to the end . In this way, Leo exemplifies the fixed quality assigned to it. Cancer/Leos are  good organizers  and tend to be popular, even inspiring.   Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and Leo is ruled by the Sun. In ancient times, the Moon, which represents fertility and instinct, was perceived as the Great Mother, responsible for nurturing all life. The Moon controls the tides and all water on Earth, and it has a strong effect on human emotions. Cancer and Cancer/Leos tend to be more sensitive to the movement of the Moon through the zodiac than are other signs,  their moods changing with the Moon's passage . In ancient times, the Sun was believed to be the center of the Universe, the core of existence, the Father. The Sun generates warmth and keeps life on Earth moving. Leos and Cancer/Leos sometimes feel they are the center of the universe, and sometimes they are! They are gregarious and social, fun-loving and live life with enthusiasm. Generally domestic and peaceful, they have strong emotional drives and won't sit still when loved ones are threatened. The Sun and Moon, mother and father, day and night; Cancer/Leos are all of these things, and finding a way to express the entire continuum is both a challenge and a much-needed emotional release.   The element associated with Cancer is Water. Water Signs are emotional: they tend to respond to the world through emotion. The element associated with Leo is Fire. Fire Signs are physical and tend to respond to the world through action.  Cancer/Leos are very intuitive and jump headfirst into life , without worrying whether their latest goal is realistic or practical. For them, everything about life is Big with a capital B, and if drama and courage is required to meet their goals, they have both in abundance.  Their warm and caring nature is very sensitive to other people's harshness.  Cancer/Leos are cheerful and self-assured, sometimes to the point of living in a fantasy world. They are always happy as long as someone is paying attention to them!   Cancer/Leos have a strong association with food. They are very imaginative and sensitive, making them  excellent amateur chefs . Some go on to make a career out of cooking. Pleasure is important to those born on the Cancer/Leo cusp, and they like to spend money to feel good. Cancer/Leos tend to enjoy physical exercise, finding that sweat helps them counter the stress inherent in their emotional nature. They prefer to play in groups, rather than solo. They are too sociable to enjoy solitary running or weight lifting, and they much prefer team sports or group exercise.   In love relationships, Cancer/Leos top the charts in almost every area, from devotion to romance. The great strength of the Cancer/Leo is in their creativity and generosity with others. Sometimes these qualities combine, resulting in thoughtful gifts or  unique solutions to problems . Cancer/Leos emotional orientation to life help them understand the difficulties their loved ones must work through.    ...for what it's worth.

      If they know the word isn't used that much, why do they send it as the "word of the day"?   Are they trying to bring it back to life or just annoy me?   jimjams \JIM-jamz\ noun plural   : jitters      Example sentence: "I love cappuccinos, but the caffeine gives me the jimjams," said Paula.    Did you know? When "jimjams" entered English in the mid-19th century, it probably referred to a specific kind of jitters — the "delirium tremens," a violent delirium caused by excessive drinking. "Jimjams" is not particularly common today, but when it is used in current American English it means simply "jitters." Etymologists aren't sure about the origin of the term. Some speculate that it came about as an alteration of "delirium tremens." Others, though uncertain of the origin of "jim" and "jam," notice that the word follows a pattern of similar words in which one sound is repeated or altered slightly. Interestingly, other words for "jitters" were formed in the same repetitive way — "whim-whams" and "heebie-jeebies" are examples.  *Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

      I found  urlLink this site  while looking for something else.  This is what caught my attention:   In the following report, look for these people of interest in the third generation:    Richard Edwards and his wife Elizabeth Tuttle, (Elizabeth was pregnant with another man's child when she married Richard Edwards, and later became insane), Sarah and Benjamin Tuttle, (Benjamin murdered his sister for "losing her virginity", and was tried and executed). Elizabeth's sister, Mercy Tuttle, was tried for killing her son.  Exerpts from books on the families of New England are reprinted telling the details of the accusations and the trials that followed.    Strange that all of the notable family members should all appear in the same generation.  An interesting read if you have the time.

      Yesterday, I was driving home from working "the dreaded late shift" and came upon a traffic jam, due to an accident in the middle of the road.  I diverted into a neighborhood and as I was driving, I noticed a quite beautiful golden retriever walking around close to the street with her makeshift lead trailing behind.   I debated, but if you know me, you know that it didn't take very long for me to decide to pull over, ask the dog her name and where her people were.   Turns out, the dog was in her own yard and had just broken free of the rope they were using to hold her in the yard.   I was glad to have found her because I imagine that street was to become quite busy shortly.  I love dogs.   I have never met a dog I didn't like.   Well, there was one dog that was just plain mean.   He tried to chew a hole into my chow's neck a few years ago.  Ted recovered well, however, we promptly delivered our vet bill to our neighbors who decided it would be a good idea for them to pay the bill, or we may have to call the police on their dog.  Our neighbors were not too intelligent; frequently allowing their rather large rottweiller and this mean, crappy dog run free in the neighborhood.   This is how kids get eaten by dogs.  Their only redeeming feature was the ownership of their white boxer, whom I loved enough to get a boxer of my own.   The boxer didn't do well in our small house at the time, though (too hyper and needed more running space), so we allowed a friend of ours to adopt her.   It was heartbreaking for me, but good for the dog.  We bought our golden retriever a few years ago, and I am hooked on goldens now.   Ginger follows me everywhere and does her part to keep Brit entertained... playing ball with her or just running around like a crazy person in the yard.   Brit could do anything to that dog and it would not even cross her mind to retaliate in any way.  Often, my husband is stunned that I will approach any dog who appears to be lost and try to find it's home.  He is worried that I will run into a dog that will attack me, or something, but I am not afraid of any dog.. just cautious in some cases.  I even sat in the middle of a busy street at 2am once comforting a dying stray dog who had just been hit by a car (ours).  He was worried it would bite me, but I wasn't afraid.   It was heartbreaking, but I was glad to be there to comfort it in its last moments.   There is something about me and dogs... we just have a calm connection, I guess.  I have known many dogs in my short life, all of them worthwhile, loved and not forgotten.      Our Ginger       Ted, the chow

        urlLink    The little kid being a clown&nbsp; urlLink      I loaded this picture in using  urlLink Hello , and it worked great!  I was uploading my pictures to my ISP's server, but this is a lot less work!  Thanks Maggie.  THIS is a  urlLink must read  for anyone who is interested in the kidnapping trend in Iraq, written by CNN correspondent Alphonso Van Marsh.  Is it principal or is it money?   You decide.     Alphonso Van Marsh  I am glad to have this type of refreshing insight into the incidents going on in Iraq.  There are the normal hyped up (although with the current situation, there is call for panic at times, I am sure!) reports and then there are people like this who are delving into the story and looking for the truth instead of scraping the surface.   "We are very upset about the way you are treating the Iraqi's.... ummm ... I mean, We need more money to fund our activities."  It's all disgusting.   I don't mean to insult anyone.  It is just that there is caring, innovative reporting and then there seems to be the stories that just aim to punish Americans for being Americans, barely scratching at the surface just to publish a story.   I am frankly tired of it.     Excuse me while I quickly dispose of my soap box.

      I subscribed to Merriam-Webster's "Word of the Day" service in the hope of expanding my vocabulary.   However, today I have received the word "rectitudinous" and I strongly believe that the example sentence below is the ONLY instance in the course of human history where this word has EVER been used.   rectitudinous \rek-tuh-TOO-duh-nuss\ adjective *1 : characterized by straightness or moral integrity  2 : piously self-righteous    Example sentence: "Their leader-to-be was . . . a sternly rectitudinous former federal judge who may be the straightest straight arrow in Washington." (Newsweek, March 16, 1987)   I am working the "late shift" today, meaning that I do not have to be at work until 10:30 (the good thing) and I work until 7pm (the bad part).   It is nice not having to worry about getting up at any particular time for a change, although I did get up around 6:15 this morning.   At least it was not the alarm clock annoying me into it.  I think I am hungry for a  urlLink vacation .   The reason:  This kind of  urlLink music  makes me want to visit some island somewhere.     I keep hoping to win some lottery I haven't bought tickets for, or some contest I haven't put a "chance to win" in for, but that never happens.   But a girl can dream!  A few years ago, I went on a  urlLink Carnival cruise  with my husband to Freeport and Nassau.  It was our first real vacation in a long time.  Being on a cruise ship was fun, but it wasn't the "fancy food 24/7" thing they always advertise, not that we needed that or anything.   During the "off-cycle" (unofficial mealtimes), there was pizza and soft-serve ice cream, and that was about it.   The kids who were cruising with their parents really loved that!   The regular meals were quite nice,though, and there was an open sushi bar most of the evening hours, which my husband seemed to love.    It was strange being in a "non-US" place for the first time after 911, but the Bahamas is a friendly place to go.  They are trying to make a living off the tourist trade, so they are pretty nice to visitors.   Don't get in any taxis that look like broken down limos, though.  They do not have air conditioning. :-)  This is the fun thing that we did in  urlLink Nassau.   Perhaps this would be more  urlLink befitting!   Gotta go for now.  Have a great day, wherever you are!    urlLink Here's a song for ya...    Lisa

      15 comments (including my own, of course!) in 24 hours.   Thanks for stopping by and announcing yourselves during the "comment contest".   Thanks to Bryan for the idea.  I've had some time to go through some of your sites and they are all quite interesting.   To tell the truth, I could spend all day reading one thing or another.. the news, blogs, encyclopedias... whatever.    Some day, I will get to the "end of the internet" and then what will I do?  I hope you have an awesome day!  You all deserve it!  Guten nacht Lisa

      I was just reading about Mark Hacking and how he told police that he had used the name Johnathan Long as an alias.   It made me wonder if he has multiple personalities.   He seems to have dreamed up some pretty elaborate stories before and after he was arrested.   CRAZY!   (that probably says it best)    It is beyond me why someone would kill a spouse anyway.  If a person was that malevolent toward a spouse, why not just divorce them? They had no kids, although there is the story about Lori Hacking being pregnant (information her own mother was not even aware of).    When I found out I was pregnant, I called my mother right after I told my husband. I  think any daughter in good standing with their mother and father would. Too wierd.  See  urlLink this  for the latest story.  I also wonder if he had more elaborate plans for her.   What if they did start to move?   Where would she be now?   Why did he want to move across the country?  Do any of the reporters in Blogland have some thoughts on this?   You're a reporter... you see a lot of strange things.  I know you can't read minds, but I would be interested to hear your take on it.  LA

      I'm having a comment contest today.   I can see that plenty of people are coming and going.  If you're reading this, leave any old comment on this post, even if it's just to say "I was here".   I want to see how many I can collect in 24 hours.  Why?  Because I see IP addresses come and go and I would love to see a few names for a change.  Here's a song for your  urlLink trouble.    I tried to find some old Isley, but good luck finding a video!  Muchas Gracias! Lisa  P.S.   Come on.. you know you want to leave a comment!      BTW, I took some photos of the  urlLink lightning storm  tonight.  I just have a point and shoot Coolpix 2100.  Sometimes I wish I had something better...  but I would need photography lessons for that.

      What will they think of  urlLink next?     The whining about my lack of air conditioning is thankfully over for now.   The problem was the contactor, the issue we were able to diagnose on our own through the Internet, but were tired of tossing money after guesses enough that we spent $75 for the AC guy to come out and tell us what we already knew.   Oh well!  Do you know that on Sundays the AC guys charge double just to come to your house?  Then, the everyday practice is to mark up the part prices.  Nice.   You're willing to pay whatever the price is because you JUST WANT AIR.  :-)   So the visit and the part that we purchased ourselves was $120, where if the air guy would have installed his own part, it would have been $200.   No thanks!   And they say one lawyer on the bottom of the ocean is a good start.  Hmph!  The good part is that I can breathe crisp, cool air now.  Thank God for mechanics and troubleshooters.  The little kid is doing well today.   She got out of bed without being too grouchy.  No tummy ache or anything.  She even let dad take her to school, which was nice for me.  Sorry there was no song yesterday.   I was feeling quite sick thanks to a migraine and crashed out around 8:30pm.   Got up at 4:55am.    I usually never get 8 hours of sleep, sadly enough.   What's THAT all about?   It felt good for a change.

      This morning, when I was on the way to preschool with my daughter, she said, "Mom, I have to go to the bathroom."   "Can you wait until we get to school, or do you need me to stop?"  "Stop."    We pulled into the gas station, and she walked in the direction of the bathroom, following me and holding her stomach.     "My tummy hurts".   I figured it was just that she hadn't eaten or maybe that was why she needed the restroom.    She used the toilet, washed her hands and we decided to grab some little donuts on the way out.   I took her into preschool and sat her down with some chocolate milk.    I asked her if she was ok and she said, "My tummy hurts..". "Try finishing your milk and see how you feel.   You may just need to lay down for awhile.    Be sure to tell the teacher if you feel bad after you lay down and call me."   I gave her a smooch and a long hug and asked her again if she was ok before I left.  I got into my car and onto the interstate and the little voice in my head that I like to call "my conscience" said, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?" "I'm going to work.... Someone is out today and Mario is there by himself. I have to get to work."   "No you don't...   Britty may be sick and what's more important?"     So, without delay, I pulled off the next exit ramp and looped back to the preschool.    I got back to school and the teacher gave me the "We knew you would be back.." look and told me that Britty was laying down.   I walked over to her ..."Are you ok?" "Mommy, my tummy feels better.   Why did you come back?"   "I was worried about you.   Are you sure your tummy is ok?"   "Yes, I just want my chocolate milk."  All I could think of was, "Thank you for letting me come back here and make sure Britty is ok.   Thank you for allowing me to show her that I'm  concerned about her.   Thank you for letting her be ok.   Thank you for letting her feel comfortable enough to stay at school and allow me to go to work."    Work was obviously not important at this point, but it was nice to be able to show up anyway.  :-)   It was one less, "I can't be in today" call I had to make.   That was about the extent of my care at that point.   I guess I may sound like a decent mom at this point, but I certainly didn't feel like one.   For one thing, I felt bad for leaving in the first place. True, it could have been gas, or something minor, but I felt bad for leaving her there with a bad tummy.   Also, earlier in the morning, my directions weren't being followed by the little sleepy person, so I raised my voice to get her attention.  We'll blame it on the intense heat in the house.   Frankly, extreme heat makes me cranky as heck.   Morning makes me cranky, too.    I need to learn to contain that better.  I am writing about all of this because I think if I can admit a fault, it can be documented for posterity's sake and then corrected.   Every mom and dad looses their patience, but I do not want to be one of those.   The most difficult thing for me to accept is making mistakes with my own child.   I require myself to be perfect (or close to it) for her.    I am afraid I am not going to meet my own expectations.  I just hope that I meet   hers.

      Big mouth "me" discovered the compressor was not shutting off when it was supposed to yesterday, so off goes the air again.   It is very hot and humid.  I should be comforted by going to work, but I have animals to be concerned about.   Luckily there is a fan and some vacation time to hopefully resolve this.   The problem seems to be the contactor, which signals the compressor to turn on or shut off.  The contacts are worn because the unit is 20 years old.    We'll try to fix this one just one more time, then it is time to do something different.   Why can't it be in the 70's this week?   If it was winter and our heat went out instead, it would be so much more bearable!  More as the story develops.

      Today kind of stunk for me.   First of all, Sunday is not my favorite day.  It just means I have to go back to work tomorrow.   I don't know what it is.  I was just promoted and I am now burnt out.  I think it is because I had to put so much work into my promotion that now I just want a LOT of time off.   It's not so bad when I get there... it's just the anticipation of it that bugs me.  Secondly, it's hotter than heck in our house.  It's finally down to 78 degrees after installing a new fan motor and a new capacitor (to the tune of $130 which was heavily discounted by a person my father-in-law knows).   The high in the house was 85 degrees.   The air has been running constantly, but I think a lot of that has to do with getting the humidity out of it.   My husband thinks I'm kidding when I say I miss apartment life.  Then, I was in the kitchen and happened to glance at Jake (our Quaker parrot), who, for some reason (Britty) is soaking wet!   If you missed last week's post, Miss Britty decided to ingest some air freshener and spritz down the dog for me (not label-recommended usage, by any means).  Well, I put the air freshener on a shelf 6 feet off of the ground, but somehow she managed to get it and then spritz down the bird.  Not only that, but I was panicked enough (birds are very sensitive) that she refused to answer any of my questions about what she had sprayed Jake with.  We only knew by the smell.  We hosed Jake down with the kitchen sink sprayer and then blow dried him off somewhat.  He seems to be fine.     More supervision is obviously required.   Anyway, totally off the subject, here is the  urlLink song du jour.   Have a good day wherever you are..  Lisa

      Today, we may sympathize with our comrades in the desert and not turn on our air conditioner.   It is not that we don't want to.   It's going to be in the mid-90's all week.    However, the compressor is making a very loud sound.  Although it is pumping cool air into the house, the motor appears to be getting extremely hot.  This is not a good sign.   Luckily there is a cool breeze coming into the house right now.  It used to be that I loved the heat.  If it was 110 outside, bring it on!   However, when I was pregnant with my daughter, my internal thermostat changed significantly and, like many other things, did not revert to normal just because I gave birth to her.   I still like the heat, but I would be happier if it was just 75 degrees all the time.   So much for my hopes of moving south and avoiding the snow.  More later, as the story unfolds.   In the meantime, if you have any "Phft... air conditioners... who needs 'em!" stories, please feel free to share them.   No panicky, "Oh my GOSH... You don't have AIR!   Now's the time to PANIC" stories, please.    Otherwise, I may spend the rest of my weekend in the hospital.
