       Hello My Friends,  Well tonight you will see some changes have been made.  I FINALLY fixed the ugly Menu / Navigation Bar.  I liked the idea, but needed to really sit down with  Fireworks or Adobe and fix it.  It was uneven, some fonts were lighter then others, and even one "button" was just a little off.    It had bugged me but I had more important things to do.  It was functional even if it wasn't pretty.  My wife even didn't notice some of the things I did.  Then last night I made a discovery.  I was buzzing around the site, I don't know why but it caught my eye.  With Dreamweaver I had set the buttons for rollover effects, and I noticed on the ones labeled "Coming Soon", they weren't having any effects at all.  Then I noticed none of the fonts were changing to red when rolled over.  So I went on a mission, pulled down a GREAT tool, and got it the way I wanted to in a HECK of a lot less time then it did playing with either of the graphic programs.    Then I noticed something I went on about in the newsletter, misspellings.  I had put Newsletter Archieve instead of Newsletter Archive.  *shaking head* Didn't even follow my own advice.  Strike 1.  To top it off, after putting the new bar in, my wife spotted on the business opportunity page, I left out "the" in the header.  I typed that page, know it like the back of my hand, reread, spell checked, grammar checked, and reread again and completely MISSED that one.  That goes back to my advice of having someone else look it over.  Strike 2.  I am hoping I don't find Strike 3 tonight.  *laugh*  Like I have been saying, the site lives up to it's name some times.  But you got to love the challenges.    Tonight I am just going to be doing some minor changes / additions, that I have experimented with on different pages.   As well as work on the Free E-Book section.    I am not sure how much if I will be able to at all work on it on Friday night.  I am going out to dinner with an old Aunt, and not sure when I will be home.  Haven't seen her in a few months so I am sure she will have lots to tell me.  *laugh*  Will post updates if I do anything major tonight.  Take care, Richard

       Hello all,  Well I am getting back to the normal updates.  Things have been a little hectic for me the past couple of days and probably will continue through this week, so if it's a bit sporadic, bear with me.  I have an idea for this week's newsletter, it's going to be about the release of Microsoft's XP Service Pack 2 update.  I have to do some research on it yet, but the initial information is not good for some marketers.   Just for a quick and brief insight as to what I am hearing from sources is that SP2 update is a very major update with lots of changes that will cause headaches for many IT departments, with concerns about what programs may be or may not be affected.  There is concern that some programs may not function at all.  The part that worries marketers is that among the updates is a pop up blocker that apparently blocks almost all pop ups.  The only ones that will left intact are user initiated ones.  For a detailed example, say you have a link that pops up a window with help or further information, but the only way to activate that pop up is by clicking on a link.  This apparently will be available as a one click one pop up window so it could not be chained so that a pop up can't spawn another pop up.  Apparently even "slide-in" types of windows will be blocked.  Which, considering the time I put into getting mine going again, bites.    But then again to anyone who has had pop ups spawn a countless number of windows or have had spy ware installed, it's a good thing.  But it's a shame that the whole marketing community is being punished for the acts of an unscrupuleous few.  One other MAJOR concern is that the new additions are also blocking some cookies, which is also affecting Click Bank sales.  During the check out procedure, CB sends a cookie containing your affiliate id, and you are credited for the sale off that cookie.  Beta testers are reporting that this cookie is being blocked and that CB is not registering the sale to that affiliate.  Which means lost sales!  Major concerns there if your a CB member.  Anyway I will have more information for the upcoming Newsletter!!! Stay Tuned!!  Richard

       Well good Monday Morning,  Hopefully it is a good one for you.    Here at ThisCanHappenToYou.com it's been it's normal craziness and what can happen next.  I swear when I picked the name of the site it was supposed to be a good name.  Now I am seeing that the site is living up to it's name.  It's definitely happening to me! *laugh*  Well the newsletter is typed, proofed and all ready to go.  I was up late last night finishing it because I got side tracked, again.  I was taking a small break and someone signed up for the Business Op report, and promptly shot me back an e-mail.  Turns out she is already part of it, but thought she would thank me.  She needed some direction and I ended up giving her ideas and some advice back.  This person also seemed very scattered by her description.  I mean she mentioned that it was just one of the programs she was involved with.  I directed her to focus on one.  Then as that one is established, branching out to others to compliment it instead of just throwing it all at the wall and seeing what sticks.  Basically draw up your plan of attack.  Course this was like writing a book by the time I was done.  *laugh*  Anyway, the newsletter is ready to go and would have been sent out this morning, but hit a snag on the broadcast.  I think it has something to do with file permissions.  I will research that later and hopefully have the NEW first edition out later today.  Basically MySQL was shooting back permission errors and not being able to create a temp table.  Which upon looking at the user permissions it should be able to since it was granted to create the original tables.    So one major event ready to happen.  2 others to go.  Will keep you updated as I get them going.  Take care and best wishes. Richard

       Hello again,  It's been a busy week in several ways.  Some good, some not so good.  But overall it's been a very good week.   I have been meaning to post but every time I think about it, or mean to, I get side tracked.  that's been my main story this week.  Let's see, Monday, I played with the Java script pop up and got that working *finally*  The original version of the script would pop up on my experiment pages, but when I put it on a test page, a copy of an active one, nothing.  But don't worry, I have it set so you only see it once per visit and only on the main page.  I have to clean it up some and dress it up, but for now am happy with it.  I have more important things to do first, then a little clean up.  I also have been playing with the Navigation bar, colors, etc off and on.  Still will end up with what I have, but remove the spacing I put in there.  Later on will clean those up to with different buttons.  But graphics is not a strength of mine and I know if I start creating buttons, I am going to be sitting there and killing a weekend.    I have been working on a report and redoing the business opportunity page, as well as writing follow up emails.  That's where most of my time has been spent this week.  Editing, reediting, writing, and setting up.  I would have had them on the site already today, but I haven't had time to finish the 2nd and 3rd messages yet.  I am half way through the 2nd.  It just needs to be different, instead of the canned ones that look like other pages.  I am different and the opportunity is better!    Losing my site the way I did, the graphics files, and me losing most of it on my home computer right as it was being switched....just a major pain.  That really hurt that page a lot.  I went back to old copies and now I remember why I scrapped it.   It doesn't help that the ones going there are basically scrapping the barrel looking for me right now.  I have everything at minimum bids, so it's like I am really buried on some terms.    This should convert them and give them more enthusiasm going in.  The main thing is keeping them enthusiastic so that they will start learning and wanting to learn.  But that should be up tonight / Saturday.  I am royally beat today.  I have been working my butt off and barely sleeping.  Wednesday night I went to bed like normal but couldn't sleep till 2am.  Then last night went to bed and was up at 3am.  Can't win.  It's all catching up.  Maybe tonight I rest.  Will see what happens when I relax a bit.  Talk to you more this weekend. Richard

       Hello again,  Well the weekend definitely brought some change of plans.  Upon returning home with dinner, I discovered my Father-in-law was in town to see us along with his wife and kid.  So Friday nights work went out the window.  I meant to post but what I had started to write seemed suddenly out of place.  I did happen to get an email out to my past subscribers though asking if they still wanted to be on my mailing list and that I would assume they did if I hadn't heard from them by Sunday and would send a package of thank you e-books for staying on.  Saturday was semi productive.  I finished up editing the front page to reflect the newsletter being opened when I came up with this seemingly brilliant idea.  Since I am passing out e-books, why not create and include one with each packet.  So my luck with Windows programs continued.  I tried out 3 programs before finding one that would actually produce a working book for me.    So I proceeded to write a brief book about my business opportunity and code it in Dreamweaver.  Upon compiling the book, it looked VERY boring so I sought to liven it up a bit.  I found one of the templates I was contemplating using for ThisCanHappenToYou.com and proceeded to enter the information, set up pages etc. to only find out that it looked like crap (excuse my language) after it was compiled.  So now came the rest of Saturday and Sunday with me playing with html and this e-book creator.  I finally discovered that this program basically only compiled bare bone html to work.  Fonts were off, layouts were off, you name it.  So finally I created about my 10th e-book and got it looking acceptable.  So I add it into the package of e-books that I was going to send out, type up a thank you email to everyone, since as of about 8pm not one person unsubscribed, and stated how proud I was to have them on my list.  There I went putting my foot in my mouth.  No more then 5 minutes after I sent the second email thanking them and saying this, here comes the unsubscribe.  I just had to go and open my mouth. *laugh*  Still losing only 1 person after these past few months is not bad.  *knocking on wood*  Of course now the trick is am I getting my spam filters and are any of them reading my messages.    The link tracker in my autoresponder should track if they are downloading the zip file though.  This should tell me how many of you are actually reading it.  Oh forgot to mention, the Java script didn't work for me yet.  It says it should be and is showing like it should but I am probably not adding it in the right spots.  That was also something I was messing with Saturday morning.  Well back to work.  Next on my list is that java script, the redoing of the business opportunity page, adding follow up letters for it, the login system and of course the Training materials.  Probably will work on the java script tonight though.  Take care, Richard

       Hello again,  Well today promises to be a good day.  The newsletter system has been tested, works great with Yahoo, Hotmail and with my home email.  I want to play a bit with setting up an html newsletter and give users the option of the type of report styles, since html will liven it up a little, but I know some don't care for it.    I do have to do some recoding on the subscribing problem page.  I wasn't sure when it would be called, but now do, and just have to retype the possible problems in.  Basically it comes up if someone has made an error by not entering their name or their email address.  I also found the books I am putting into the subscription package, and I am not thrilled with the choices, but I am happy with them.  I might rummage around some more later today and see what I can come up with.  I also found the script for the pop inside window, sorry guys, I know how much everyone hates pop ups, but it does help grow a business.  It will only be promoting the newsletter, so your not going to be swamped with popups for viagra.  God knows we get enough of those in our emails.  I am going to tinker with it too, to see if I can get it to set a small cookie to set, so that it doesn't pop down every time for you.    Other then that, everything else is fine.  My wife just HAD to show me her stitches yesterday.  I get home with dinner, stopped at the sub shop, and right before I am getting ready to eat I hear, "Wanna see my stitches?".  Sometimes spouses have such wonderful timing.    Well a short post today!  I hope everyday is successful for you! Take care, Richard

       Good Morning,  Well I am trying something new today.  I had been writing the blog entries right on the Blogger site, and I remembered that my Journal software had an option to do this.    Course now I have to remember to watch what I post to the Blog, might give away some "secret business" plans. *laugh* or some personal stories I don't want you guys reading, the NC17 rated stuff. *wink*  Anyway, back to business.  The first autoresponder I set up worked as planned and flawlessly.  Which considering my problems the last few months is a very nice change of pace.  The newsletter autoresponder/subscriber system should be up by Thursday night hopefully.  I have it set up, created 4 new pages for it, tested how or if the email subscription system would work.  To clarify, it's not the responder that's not  It doesn't naturally, but not to fear, web based options are there.  Just as easy and painless.  I just need to actually get it on the web pages, as well as test it out to make sure it's working flawlessly.  I would say it would be up late tonight, but I know I will have to set up some emails, put together a package of stuff to reward you guys, and a few other things.   Plus I know if I say tonight it will be there, guess what, it won't be and I will be kicking myself.  In case you didn't notice the "should" and "hopefully", I am not 100% locking myself into an exact date.  Besides another day or 2 is not going to kill anyone but my business.  I am not worried because once people start seeing more of the site, they will see the value.  It's just a matter of good old fashioned work.  At times it's a little overwhelming.  I will admit to that.  I see this point where I want it to be, my final goal, which I know is going to keep moving as I expand my horizons and the business grows.  But it's the mountain in front of me of all the things I need to have set up before everything before it goes into a more of a cruise control.  I mean it's the subscription system, it's the login system, it's the pop up reminder to subscribe, it's getting the first newsletter written, it's programming the pages, it's getting a payment system in place, it's writing the training section at least to an acceptable level, it's finding the free ebooks, reviewing the free ebooks before I post them, the search system, restarting the advertising, the writing of the ad copy, and on and on and on......  I know I am taking out chunks of it at a time, and most of it the wheels are starting to slowly turn, but when you step back, take a look at it, it's like WOW, look how much I have to do yet, before I can really take a step back and take a deep breathe and relax a little.  But then again, I can already look back and see how much I have done, a lot of what you don't see.  That list is just as big.  I know I would have really preferred to do this in a slower time frame, since I had some of it already in place but ideas evolve,  more pop up as I learn new things and new options or better ways of doing things are shown.  Well maybe that's not a good way to put it, learning.  Practical application of theory would be a better way of putting it.  The "how do I use this in my situation" question being answered.  Ok enough of the philosophical boring stuff.  Everyone have a GREAT Day!  Richard

       Hello all,  Well today was a great day!    After my experiences last night I woke up to some emails from the gentleman who I got my autoresponder script from.  It appears he bought the company and software from someone else, and has been trying to clean up their mess.  All the different email addresses and the 2 different site addresses were his.  So that was a nice sigh of relief.  It turns out when I paid for the product, I was referred to an old link which when I downloaded the product, it was a maintenance type file for a previous release that I should never have received.  Since the download area at his clients area was not working for me for some unknown reason (he tested it and naturally it worked) was sending me an empty zip file, he set up a special download link for me.  With a new script in hand, I ran only into one additional problem on the install and it had to do with the license.  It seems there is some confusion in the documentation I received, what he thinks is in there, and what actually takes place.  To bore you further, the license is supposed to be inserted into a script file and that file was not being updated.  The documentation never stated that the access level for this file should be updated (at least my version), he says it should be in there, and what actually took place it wasn't.  Either way, the gentleman was FANTASTIC, the software is very slick!  Even with the headaches I had, I would bend over backwards in support!  I already mentioned to him that when my subscriber base is a little larger, I am going to work out a package for you!  He state he would be more then happy to work out a package for you guys!  If your reading this now, and are looking for a newsletter subscription package with all the bells and whistles and LOTS of extras, drop me a comment and I will make sure you get to the right place and drop him a note to let him know where you came from so that he can make sure your handled with some of the best customer service I have gotten in a long time!  I have not one single regret!  My wife will attest that for me to give a service or product or company my endorsement, it means a lot!  I have been known to boycott and generally inform upper management when I am not happy, and it takes a lot for me to be unhappy.  I fully understand shit happens, people have bad moments or bad days, so I live with what happens.  But when it happens repeatedly, or a strange circumstance happens that just blows me away, I make sure someone knows I am unhappy.  I am half tempted to tell a story that will sure to make you laugh, but I am going to refrain for now.    Anyway the first responder is being set up in another window (Blogger was VERY slow loading so I started) and the new subscription device should be ready for testing over the next few days.  So if your not on the newsletter mailing list, WATCH for it.  I am going to make a nice little package available as a thank you.  Till tomorrow, may all your dreams happen!  Richard

       Hello again,  Well to keep you updated and to show my luck is still holding true, today was an interesting day.    I narrowed down my choices of mailing list programs and found one with some great features, and sold myself on it.  Yes I did have a nice one, but I was never completely happy with it, hence the change.    Well after paying, getting the download page, I open the manual, start following instructions, upload the files, open the SQL database, and go to the install page, and it says I need files from SourceGuardian, that these files are encrypted.  So I download them and find out I need access to the php.ini file.  Now I know I don't have access to that unless I up my hosting package and I am put on a different server, which in turn means more down time till the files are transferred.  This also probably means reconfiguring more scripts, possibly the pages themselves, and a bunch more headaches.   So I stop there and contact 24 hour tech support, show them the problem and they come up with the ingenious suggestion of bypassing it with a .htaccess file.  Now of course they can't / won't just do this for me, but they give me directions what to look up on the web.    Well let's just say my head was spinning after the first dozen websites, and not being absolutely sure 100% of what I am looking for is not helping.  So I contact the host again, find out what it will cost to upgrade the service and now have doubled my costs if I decide to do this.  But I hold off, knowing that the 4th of July holiday will make nothing happen till Tuesday anyway.  So I decide to mull it over for the weekend, since I know for the most part, I will have to bring my work to a screeching halt for the weekend if I decide to do this.  So to make a long story even longer, I decide to send a message to the program support team since they must have some kind of work around and if not I am going to reconsider my purchase, since neither the site, the documentation or the forums for the software any mention of this particular requirement.  So after dinner, attempting to watch Bad Santa (not that great of a movie), and watching the end of Rocky II, I come back to check my emails.  Low and behold the author wrote me back saying he is not sure why I am getting that message but he will look into it.  About an hour later he sent another email saying he is puzzled as to what is going on, since his files are not encrypted.    So now I have emails from his autoresponder from about 4 different email addresses, 2 web sites with exactly the same name except one is .com one is .net.  But all the passwords and site addresses are good.  He asked if I downloaded from this other address and I said no, I got it from this address and sent the page link back to him also informing him that the link was on the Paypal page.  Now in an investigative mood, I download the file from the new address, and the passwords work and there is my information and the license number given to me in previous emails.  So I click the file download and boom it's done.  Well the first file I downloaded, was almost 5 megs in size, and this new one is 1kb.  BIG difference.  I open the zip file.  Nothing in it.    So here I sit, wondering if I should go ahead and develop more pages, if I need to contact Paypal and cancel everything, as well as wondering if I am not helping someone help build / debug his web pages and program.  Even though I am frustrated by all the things going on, I have to sit back and laugh while I wonder, what's next.......  Life is never dull.  Lately, I wonder how much hair I will have left by the time this all is done.  I might make my site a donation page to beg people to give me money for hair replacement surgery.  *laugh*  Hopefully you can find some humor and it made you smile and nod, saying to yourself, I know this feeling.  Have a Happy Fourth! Richard

       Hello to all that read this.  I welcome you to the This Can Happen To You.com Business Journal / Blog.  This is a very exciting time in my companies history.  After months of deciding where to go, what to do, the frustrations, the disappointments, the achievements, things are finally moving ahead full stream.  To give you just a small taste of some of the frustrations that recently happened in my life, my wife recently had surgery.  Everything is fine, she's doing great, but did play with my mind for a couple of weeks from the time that we discovered she required surgery and the actual time of her returning to the recovery room.  An experience like this reinforces the love you feel for someone, even if the procedure is relatively minor.  It's still surgery and you never know when a complication could arise.  Then there was the computer crash.  Not just any computer crash but one of my own doing and with ultimately the worst timing.  I had just switched over to a new server, entered the DNS changes to have the domain forwarded to my new hosting company.  Thinking I had time to pull anything I really needed off the server, and not being able to upload files to the new host, I decided to "tinker" and "upgrade" my home computer.  Well without going into too much details my home computer was down for almost a week, all the graphic files for the site were lost, and there was a significant pile of hair around the chair by the computer.  One warning you may not have thought of.  Even though the files are hosted on another computer, when you change hosts the change over will also cause you not to be able to contact the old host via FTP.  So that's just a taste, and I am not going to bore you with more.    In making lemonade out of lemons, I found a new template, that I redesigned and altered significantly and the recreative bug has bit me.  Ideas are flowing out of me so strongly that I have to keep a journal by the bed at night.  I often lay down tired from working on the pages but find new exciting ideas just keep coming.  I can't work as fast as the ideas are coming into my head.  I am not going to post most of them here but in the coming weeks, you will see some very exciting improvements to the site.  To give you just a few -   * Free Ebooks (Currently being shifted through and worked on) * Return of the Newsletter / Ezine  * The Archives - will be sparse since I also lost a good chunk of the old ones * Training articles on how to promote your business - the heart and true gold mine.  As a subscriber, you will be sent updates as these sections open up, and I can give out more information.  As I reintroduce the subscription program and as well as adding the login program, I will be offering a special one time only deal to select individuals.   If your already on the thiscanhappentoyou.com mailing list, your spot is secure as a thank you for sticking with me through my trials and tribulations and you will automatically recieve the offer.    If your just joining thiscanhappentoyou.com, and have stumbled on to this blog, I urge you to bookmark the page and check back everyday since you will probably be able to sneak in before I launch the promotion and lock down the site.  The site will be subscription only because of all the fantastic information that it will contain!!!   But as a hint, a select few will be able to bypass this.    I have so much to put down on the pages, that I could write a book!  Maybe down the line that might be on the agenda *wink*  That's enough for now.  Check back every few days or every week.  You can follow what is happening at thiscanhappentoyou.com.  I promised a few loyal people (you know who you are) that I would do so.  Take care, Richard

       Hello,  Just want to give a brief update.  I have been off the web since Thursday night, the victim of Spyware.    I have been unable to connect to the Internet since then and just got my system back up and working late yesterday.   I will have the newsletter out this  coming weekend.  I apologize for the delay, but when you can't connect to the net, there is not much you can do.  I basically reinstalled AGAIN.  I am definitely making a core backup this time.  This is the 2nd time in 2 months that I have started basically from scratch.  At least this time I am better prepared and things are moving along quickly.  I am also getting sick of hospitals.  I have seen more then my fair share this year.  My wife's grandmother had a stroke Friday night.  She is fine now.  Well as fine as can be expected.  She is now paralyzed completely on the left side and will not be able to leave the hospital or care facility again.  So real joy there.  But she is talking, she is coherent, and for the most part seems to doing well.  She is stable and in her own room, which Friday night by the looks of everything, we were not sure she would make it through the weekend.  I will post more when things calm down a bit.  Take care, Richard
