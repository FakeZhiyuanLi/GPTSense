      For those of you who are reading this (in other words, the people who already know everything I'm about to tell you), the next meeting is this Friday, the 25th, at Ashley's house, at 11:30. I'd appreciate people getting the word out to everybody they know.

      Okay, please everyone get this out to everyone you can as quickly as possible.  This Friday, the 25th, we (I) are (am) thinking about holding a filming session.  If this works for anyone, please let me know.  If you do not know my number, you can contact Ashley, Tom D, or Ned.  I really need to know if this will work soon, so that I can organize it.  Ashley, can we hold it at you're house?  If not, we can host it at the library/green.  We might be able to host it at my house.  I know for sure that we can host it at my house in the future, but maybe not this Friday.  Please get this out to everyone.  LONG LIVE DEMODOKOS!

      Alright, due to the lack of people signing up, I'm going to seriously need anybody who reads this (nobody) to try to get all other members they know to sign up. That way, may this troupe won't completely collapse before it's even taken off.  I'm also thinking that now that school's wrapping up, maybe we should have a meeting sometime soon. Piotr won't be able to make that one, as he's having a merry old romp in Polandland, but assuming other people can make it, we might actually get stuff done. And yes, I promise that this time we'll have actual scripts, though I encourage you people to write some as well, as always.  By the way, Abby, if you're reading this, it might be a good idea for you to set up a new username if your old one is, in fact, wonked out. If you do, I can invite that one into the group.

      Okay, a few of you have signed up now (at this count, three), so I'm going to put up the first post with any actual point.  First of all, as you can see, I've given the blog a facelift. Right now, I've just slapped a new template on it, but since I find it difficult to pass up the chance to do some code tinkering, I may customize the look further later on.  Something that you should also note is that only official members of the blog (Demodokos troupe members, in other words) can comment on the posts, as well as, obviously, post stuff in the first place. That's just to keep it less cluttered with other stuff, so we can just talk business here.  We are also now registered under Creative Commons. You can click on the link at the sidebar for the specifics, but basically it means that while people can copy whatever work we post up here, they can't use it commercially without our permission, or alter it in any way, and they must always give us credit for it. Seems reasonable enough to me. Anyways, the point is, that means you can feel free to post a script idea up here, so we can discuss it.  Anyways, down to business. We need a time and date for the next meeting. We also need to know what we're going to do there. First of all, I think it would be good to wrap up the "What to Do and What not to Do During Dating" sketch which we started last time, just with more people. I think we're almost done with that, and we'd have plenty of time for something else after.  So that leaves us with room for another sketch. Personally, I'd like to see the "3 Fast, 3 Furious" idea be used, but as always, this is an open discussion. I'm still writing the script for that, so I may post it up here, or just email it to all of you later.  Actually, come to think of it, while I've got you all here, we can do casting too, so we know who has to show up at what meeting. This will make things a lot easier.  Alright so any scheduling ideas?  UPDATE: By the way, for those of you in the group who don't already know about it, here's  urlLink another group vaguely similar to ours,  that's seems to have had some success. They are what, in part, inspired the idea for this group in the first place. Check them out, if you haven't already.

      This is the first post on the official blog of the sketch comedy troupe  Demodokos.  I'm  Demodokos  writer/director/editor/sometimes-actor  urlLink Ned Resnikoff.  Sorry, couldn't resist a little blog-whoring there.  Anyways, for those of you who don't already know, this is a filmed sketch comedy group, with what I think is some really good, really random stuff. We're working on our first show right now, which we're probably going to publically screen somewhere, with a ticket price of two dollars, or something. Anyways, the purpose of this blog is to keep you, the non-member, informed about the creation of this group. It also serves another purpose, which is to work out all the scheduling stuff for the group, so we can hopefully, meet regularly and get this thing done.  If you're a member of the troupe, register on  urlLink Blogger,  then email  urlLink here.  I'll set you up as a member here, so you can post whenever. Don't forget to visit regularly, for scheduling stuff, and just for shooting sketch ideas back and forth. I'm going to get around to copyrighting this blog under Creative Commons eventually, so the sketch ideas we post up here should be safe.

      Woohoo, my very own news blog.  . . . just in time to miss the Democratic National Convention. Eh. I'll cover it in four years. In the meantime, there's still plenty of news out there.  Anyways, I'm Ned, and I'll be your blogger for this evening. I'm a writer, and  urlLink here's my website.  I've been itching to start up a news blog for a while, being a huge news junkie myself, and wanting to spread the love. I guess you could label me as a progressive liberal, as well as a passionate secularist and also a passionate supporter of freedom of the press. I also love journalistic integrity and some attempt at objectivity, which is why I'm not a big fan of major news outlets in general today.  But that's all pretty much par for the course. What separates me from other liberal bloggers? Well, I'm far more sarcastic, for one, and you'll probably see that shine through from time to time. Also, I'm about to move into my sophomore year of high school in about a month. And my experience in the field of journalism pretty much amounts to one year on the school newspaper. Although, it is a mighty fine newspaper.  So no, I'm not a real journalist, although I hope to be eventually. And I won't pretend to me. But I will make an attempt to be as informative as possible, while still indulging in rampant editorializing. I'll try to update as often as possible, and comments or debate are always encouraged on either this blog, or in the inbox of my email account (although preferably on the blog).  Anyways, that's pretty much it for now. No news in this point. In all honesty, I just needed to post something so that Blogger would let me preview the changes to the template I'm making.

      Continuing my habit of posting clips of bushisms, here's  urlLink another interesting one.  This one's notable, because there's no way it can just be a stupid slip-up. It genuinely sounds like he has no idea what he's talking about, possibly because he didn't bother to do his homework on the subject at all, and barely has an idea of what it is. Which is, to put it frankly, retarded.  Note that you hear the press actually laughing at him in the background. Some say this is an example of how liberal the press is. I like to think it's nervous laughter, because they're all afraid they're about to watch the most powerful man on Earth have breakdown.  Another really dumb thing Bush said recently is as follows:   urlLink "Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that the "the rich in America happen to be the small business owners" who put people to work.   Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because "the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway."   Quote number one: Moronic. Explain to me how small business owners are richer than the guy that runs Wal-Mart.  Quote number two: Even more retarded. Aren't the really obscenely rich his supporters in many cases? Anyways, it's a sorry-ass excuse for not raising taxes on the rich. Just because they're going to try to dodge it doesn't mean we shouldn't give it a shot.  Another irritating quote from the article:   "I'm still making up my mind," said Chuck, who will be voting for the first time in November and wants to pursue a career in the military. "I was impressed with his speech, but I suspect I would also be impressed with a speech by (Democrat John) Kerry. It's going to be tough to decide."   Yep. For at least this guy, it's not a matter of the record of either candidate. It's their public speaking skills. Ugh.  Moving along, I regret to inform you that Kerry is now saying that despite what he knows now,  urlLink he would have still voted for the war in Iraq.  It's not as bad as it sounds, because he still criticizes Bush for misleading the American people, mishandling the war, etc. But still, you have to wonder; why would he go to war, if the entire justification for the war was completely false?  And if you aren't watching  The Daily Show  yet,  urlLink here is a very good reason for why you should be.

      Something I probably should have mentioned from post number one is that this blog has a slightly different format from most news blogs. That is to say, sometimes it's not so much current events focused as just on the world around us in general, even if it's been that way for a while. I'll understand if you feel cheated. Well, no I won't.  Anyways, something that's been bothering me a lot recently is the state of our educational system. That seems rational, since I'm currently being processed through it.  I think I've indentified a key problem in not just our educational system, but those found worldwide. And it's something that I find extremely irritating.  It's simply a matter of how the scientific method, and skepticism in general, is taught, and how it's applied throughout life as a result. It seems the entire modern basis of education relies on mindless memorization of facts, to the point where some teachers frown down upon anybody questioning said "facts." In eighth grade, for example, a teacher informed me that the spine was an organ. Fortunately, I knew better by that point, but I'm afraid some of my classmates did not. And since a person in authority informed them of that, they may go through the rest of their lives with that small piece of misinformation lodged in their minds.  I'm not saying that teachers can never be wrong. They're only human, after all. But what bothers me is this insistence that students shouldn't be skeptical of their teachers.  Think about it; from kindergarten onwards, students are simply told facts by people in positions of authority, and then told to accept those facts. If those facts are incorrect, it doesn't matter; many teachers frown upon students questioning those facts, and, of course, on a test, entering the "wrong" answer means a lower grade. This is damaging because it means that a person's skepticism is suppressed. And that's especially damaging in a Republic, where a large part of electing the most qualified candidate is maintaining a healthy skepticism towards all parties. Unfortunately, it seems like skepticism in America is floundering.  I propose a new educational system; one from where the very beginning of one's education onward, children are told again and again not to believe everything they hear, even from the people who tell them this. Where part of education is learning  how  to think, not just what to think. In other words, where children are raised to consistently test and question their environment, growing not just within the classroom but without, to become informed, educated members of society.  So how would this work, exactly? I'm still not entirely sure. But it's worth considering, even if it's never implemented.

      Remember those vets I mentioned last post? Remember the guy who recanted the claims he made earlier? Well,  urlLink he's recanted the recantment of the claims he made earlier.   Note that as  urlLink The Telegraph points out,  in both cases, the recantment was in the form of a signed affidavit, and, as they say in the article, "he fell short of denying any U-turn outright."  This guy is really starting to confuse me. Either he has some sort of political bipolar syndrome, or he pretty much be led to say anything in a signed affidavit by anybody. If the latter's the case, I'm going to try to get him to sign an affidavit promoting this blog.

      Back in April, Joseph Farah, founder of the FOX News-esque  urlLink WorldNetDaily  predicted that Kerry was going to win, because Kerry is, of course, a cunning, evil, despicable man.  Well, the one thing you have to admire is that Farah is always willing to admit he's wrong, as long as the evidence really doesn't point in either direction at the moment. Now  urlLink Bush is going to win.  Why? Because of a group that's been getting a lot of press lately, the ironically titled  urlLink Swift Boat Vets for Truth.   I'll let Farah sum up SBVT's claims:   They tell a simple, straightforward story: Kerry lied. He lied about everything. He lied about his wounds. He lied about his actions in Vietnam. He lied to get medals. He lied about what he did with his medals. He lied about atrocities. He lied before the Senate. He lied to his own men. He abandoned and betrayed his comrades.   And his prediction for how the commercials these guys are running is going to affect the outcome of the election?   I think Kerry is going to rue the day he ever decided to run for president. Not only is he going to lose in a landslide to an undistinguished incumbent, he's going to be humiliated.   But whoa! Slow down for a minute! How do we know these boys are telling the truth?   On the other hand, what these vets say is all very believable – because these men have no reason to lie. They have every reason to get behind their most famous friend – even if they didn't like him, even if they thought he was no good. He could help them immensely – if they just shut up and let Kerry make up his own history. But they are standing up to be counted because they actually believe in something bigger than themselves – something called the United States of America.   But here's where Farah starts to step on his own toes. Note his reasoning that they must be telling the truth because they have no reason to lie. First of all, any skeptic worth his or her salt will tell you that eyewitness reports are notoriously unreliable, especially those from thirty years ago. And unfortunately, they really don't have a whole lot more besides eyewitness reports.  Second of all, here's another quote from the same article:   Kerry is Clintonesque in that he seems to lie even when there is no point in lying. It comes naturally to him.   So, what Farah's basically saying is that Kerry lies even when he has no reason to lie. But the entire basis of his argument is that the Swift Boat Vets are believable precisely because  they  have no reason to lie. Double standard, anyone?  Anyways,  urlLink FactCheck.org,  as usual,  urlLink sets the record straight.  It appears that some of the claims made on the Vets' website are, themselves, most likely not true. One of my favorite examples appears below:   Two who appear in the ad say Kerry didn't deserve his first purple heart.  Louis Letson, a medical officer and Lieutenant Commander, says in the ad that he knows Kerry is lying about his first purple heart because “I treated him for that.”  However, medical records provided by the Kerry campaign to FactCheck.org do not list Letson as the “person administering treatment” for Kerry’s injury on December 3, 1968.  The medical officer who signed this sick call report is J.C. Carreon, who is listed as treating Kerry for shrapnel to the left arm.   Also, as mentioned in FactCheck, one of the Swift Boat Vets even  urlLink made a retraction.   So I guess this means somebody was lying besides Kerry. And Farah, as usual, leapt at their claims, merely because they were anti-Kerry, and therefore, any promotion of said claims helped Bush's chances at a second term. Now  that's  what I call good journalism!

       urlLink Bush in a rare moment of honesty. Whoops.    urlLink Wonkette  brought up  urlLink a good point about this,  which I figured Peter would bring up anyways eventually if he read this post.   Come on, guys: Why make a big deal out of goofs like this?   Answer: Because I'm not a real journalist, and can therefore make a big deal out of whatever news I want (can't speak for  urlLink Slate  on that point). Also, I saw the video, and it's hilarious. It's like  urlLink All Your Base  all over again. Well, not really, but you know what I mean.

      A fourteen year old boy in Leicester, England, was attacked with a hammer and stabbed to death by his friend not too long ago. The seventeen year-old culprit pleaded guilty.  Ideally, when somebody murders somebody else, that person is dealt justice by the law and government of the land, and that's the end of it. Of course, that rarely is the case when the killer is a teenager. Speaking as a teenager, I find it a little insulting that when an adult commits murder, he or she is considered responsible for his or her own actions, and that's the end of it, but when a teenager commits murder, it seems like everybody's desperate to find a scapegoat.  As is the case here.   urlLink "Manhunt" Computer Game is Blamed for Brutal Killing   Please pay careful attention to the placement and use of the word "blamed." It's not the suspect who's being blamed. It's not the kid who pleaded guilty, for Christ's sake. It's the video game he likes to play.  Now, I'm a gamer, but I haven't actually played  Manhunt.  It never really interested me that much. I have, however, played  Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Quake, Doom, Mortal Kombat,  and a number of other games that have been at one point or another, implicated in killings. I run my own  Dungeons and Dragons  game, the game which some believe caused several suicides, and who even more believe is related to Satan worship. I've listened to a couple Marilyn Manson songs, although found some of his stuff to be too over the top to be anything more than bland. I even read  Rage,  the book written by Stephen King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, which some believe glorifies and even encouraged a school shooting. And  what's more, most of my friends share similar experiences, and on more than one occasion I've played many of the above games with them.  I mention all of this because, as mentioned, all of the above products have been blamed, at one point or another, for adolescent violence. If a teenager who develops a liking for one game that sparks violent behavior, surely somebody like myself, who has played a number of them, as well as listened to violent music, and even read violent books, should be a mass murderer by now?  Funny story: I'm a pacifist. I've never even punched somebody in my entire life.  Now of course, this is entirely anecdotal, but my point is that teenagers possess to a good degree the same critical thinking skills as adults when it comes to discerning fantasy from reality. This should be obvious. Developmentally, we're extremely close to adulthood, and I don't see why it's assumed that we cannot discern the difference between glorified, fictitious violence and actually going out and killing another human being.  So here's a challenge to the media, and politicians such as Senator Lieberman: The next time somebody who plays video games, or listens to loud music, goes out and kills somebody, put the blame where it belongs; with the person who actually went out and ended another human being's life.  Oh, and one more thing:  Manhunt  is rated "M," which is the video games equivalent of an "R" rating. My parents let me play "M" rated games, but if other parents have concerns about how similarly rated games are influencing their children, they should simply forbid them to play said games. If it were actually true that games with the "M" label could influence completely normal teenagers to go out and kill, then the parents are clearly the ones to blame in this case, as they were negligent enough to let their poor innocent son play  Manhunt  on a regular basis.  And for another excellent article on the  Manhunt  controversy, click  urlLink here.

       The New York Times  has revealed that after four decades,  urlLink there may soon be fairly conclusive evidence  as to how many shots were fired during the assassination of President Kennedy.  Regarding the number of shots fired, the article says:  It is a question that has bedeviled government officials, law enforcement agents and historians since the actual event, leading to an array of conspiracy theories involving the mob, Fidel Castro, Lyndon B. Johnson, Russians or, as the film director, Oliver Stone, would have audiences believe, the "military industrial complex."   Personally, I'm with  The Onion  on this one, or as one of their headlines proclaims:    KENNEDY SLAIN BY CIA, MAFIA, CASTRO, LBJ, TEAMSTERS, FREEMASONS President Shot 129 Times from 43 Different Angles

      Oh, that crazy Vatican. According to CBC News, they now  urlLink "fear the blurring line between men and women."   Wow. That makes no sense whatsoever, but they're the Vatican, so I'm sure they're thinking this through rationally.   The 37-page document written by one of Pope John Paul II's closest aides, says radical feminists make "homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent, in a new model of polymorphous sexuality."   Um . . . okay. Wait a minute, I'm confused here. Feminists are making homosexuality and heterosexuality equivalent? What happened to the gay rights activists who used to do stuff like that? Did they subcontract to the feminists? Sheesh. Lazy gay rights activists. Next the anti-war protestors are going to be outsourcing all of their picketing to feminists in India.   Compiled by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the document attacks what it calls the "ideology of gender"   Okay, does anybody have any idea what that part means?   and stresses that woman "is not a copy of man."   Yep, you read that right. Women differ from men in some ways. And now, thanks to the Vatican, we finally have a document to prove it!   It reaffirms the Church's stand against ordaining women and urges governments to make sure women can be granted appropriate work schedules so that they "do not need to neglect their families if they want to pursue a job."   Okay, so you have to give them credit for going the path of "slightly less sexist than I thought they were going to be." Instead of "women shouldn't have jobs," it's now, "women shouldn't have  full time  jobs." Come on, admit it; it is a slight improvement.  One last thing:   The document also deals with same-sex marriage, saying that "God wanted a Christian marriage, a marriage between a man and a woman," and not between people of the same gender.   Believe it or not, this quote doesn't bother me at all. Legally, I feel very strongly that marriages of either sexual preference should be equal. In terms of which religious institutions grant same-sex marriages, the government really has no control over that, and I don't really give a shit as long as it doesn't impact legislation on government-recognized gay marriage. So really, the only reason I put that last quote up is because I noticed the last part of it isn't in quotes, and got curious about the actual wording of the document.

      Yep, there's trouble in the FBI again, and if former Agent German's  urlLink very serious allegations  are correct, then the bureaucracy that the 9-11 Commission partially blamed for preventing an effective response to the looming terrorist threat is alive and well. And not only that, but German claims that those who protest against these questionable practices are themselves discredited through misinformation created by the Bureau. I'm going to remain skeptical until I see further evidence of what he's claiming, but if it's true, than the Bureau needs a serious overhall.  One point of slight editorializing in the article that I would argue against:   Mr. German's account of what he considers undue restraint in pursuing terrorism leads may give pause to civil libertarians who have accused the F.B.I. of rushing to judgment and using overly aggressive tactics in some terror cases.   First of all, I would say that's for the civil libertarians who read the article to decide, not the reporter who wrote the article. I don't think this situation is exactly analogous to other cases either, as it's unclear why exactly the FBI would go to such lengths to prevent the investigation German was supposedly pushing for.  So what do you guys think? Who's telling the truth here, German or the FBI? If German's allegations are correct, what the hell is the FBI thinking, and how do we fix it?

      First people wanting to hear Cheney speak had to  urlLink pledge their loyalty to Bush.  The article claims it's for security reasons, which seems only slightly probable. But as  urlLink Talking Points Memo  points out,  urlLink this article  tells a slightly different story.   Yier Shi, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C., said today's rally was meant to reward and enthuse Bush-Cheney supporters, not to be a forum to preach to skeptics.  Democrats, independents and others were welcome to attend the speech, he said— as long as they like Bush and Cheney.   Which, of course, fits right in with their policy of securing the conservative base that would vote for them anyways, while ignoring the swing voters.  So where does  urlLink this story  fit in? The Bush campaign says it was for security reasons, and I at the moment I think that's probably correct, but that doesn't exactly mean they were necessary or appropriate security measures. Popat is, as the article says, a photographer with six year's experience working on assignment from a newspaper.  As for the actual content of Cheney's speech, from  urlLink this article,  it looks like he centered it mostly around the war on terror, an ironic decision considering that terrorism's been consistently on the rise ever since the start of the "war on terror."  Interesting quote:   We are doing everything in our power to defend against a terrorist attack on our homeland."   It could just be my imagination, but it seems like that sentence was fairly carefully worded. "On our homeland." It's true that we haven't suffered a terrorist attack since 9/11 on the actual US mainland, but what about Iraq? What about Spain, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia? What about Israel? Outside of America, terrorism is having a field day, and the past few years have been some of the worst ever in terms of international terrorism. Much of this can be blamed on Bush's reckless foreign policy (if anything, Al Qaeda started showing up in Iraq only after we invaded), but is he doing a good job with the war on terror?  Well of course. As Cheney says, there haven't been any attacks on the homeland, and that's what matters.
