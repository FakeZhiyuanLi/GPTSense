      My cousin got caught sneaking out last night. I was suppose to go with but i needed my sleep. I also had a feeling that something was gonna happen. He took out his brother's new camry and drove it at like 1 or 2 in the morning. He picked up two of our other friends and drove to saratoga to see his potential gf. haha. Before he snuck out of his house, he was in the backyard and the birds in the backyard started squealing which woke up his brother to find his car missing. He went to check up on his brother and thought he was sleeping but it was just pillows. They called the cops to report a missing car. i can't anything else or they will use this as evidence...hahahaha

      I got caught going out yesterday. I asked my mom if i can go out with my friends to the movies but she said no and had no reason for it, well she did say i would get addicted to going out, but i won't. The only reason i want to go out is so i don't have to listen to my mom nag and complain and yell at me for stupid things like cleaning my room. It's not about going out, its more about having freedom. I'd rather stay home all day home alone than have someone else in the house yelling at me for things to do. Anyways...heres the story:  I was going on a second date but this time my friends were going too. We wanted to watch white chicks since it would come out that day. The movie started at 2:15 and it would be an hour and 45 minutes long. I thought i would make it home on time before my mom but i forgot that she didn't need to pick up my sister from work and so she came home and didn't see me. We finshed the movie and came out to see that the time was 4:15. I was scared. First, i felt stupid asking my sister's friend for a ride but he lived close i guess..Then i was afraid of my mom yelling at me in front of my friends. Our ride came to drop everyone off at my house. I come home to see that my mom wasn;t home. YES! so i hurried to call my cousin and tell her to whoever that asks that i was at her house with my friends and that we came home at 4. My friends stay until 6 and thats when my mom came home to pick me up to go to my cousin's house to eat dinner. She asked where i was because she called home and no one picked up and she came home and didn't see me home. I told her that i was at my cousin's house. She knew i lied. XP. We drove my friend home and she told me that she saw my cousin at Costco...do'h. She wanted to seem more like a bigshot and so she asked when i came home. I said 4 but she said she was home at 4. It was around 4. pshhh...i didn't really care anymore because my cousin that went with me to the movies told her the truth because he said that she caught us...(when she really didn't) I said i was sorry and she was just happy that she caught me that she didn't really care about what i did. She wanted to seem smarter than me. I'll let her have that one...

      Yes yes, i'm growing up. It was ok. Not really what i wanted. or maybe because my friend made it seem as something big was going to happen on my first date. It would've could've happened, but she was a tease. It was a good date because i wasted no money at all. We watched a movie thanks to the Dvd player from my own own, played some video games and just watched tv. I walked her back to school so she could get picked up. I was going for the kiss but she rejected me :'(. its ok. she said next time. Pshhhh...trying to play hard-to-get....Imma play that next time. Damn....i got game. hahaha...j/k. Overall, it was good day.

      This is what you get when you are bored at a party and theres nowhere to go and suddenly have an idea of taking pictures of dumb things.   My cousin being SpiderMan.    I took the picture, I have wonderful timing.

      I took my SATs earlier than most people my age because we're going to have to take the new version. It seemed fairly easy and not as bad as everyone says it is. Or maybe its the way i am. I never seem to notice the negative things. Having that perception may be good for some things, but can really ruin my hopes. I thought i would've scored 1100 or more. I wanted to beat everyone else in the family. (We're competitive like that.)     That was my score. It came out today but i saw it yesterday. My friend got the same score. I lied and said that i got 1000 to see if he would think of me as a person with only 1000 on their SATs. Thats what a friend did to us when we asked her about her PSATs. That was stupid. She said she got an 800 something, when she got a score higher than everyone else. She's fcuking stupid.   P.S. I'm not a hyprocrite. I'm a competitive person like that. I don't manipulate others.

      I got to hang around with many different types of "friends" these past three days. The first was with one close friend. The second was with my sis and her friends. The third is with my friends that i hang around with. And the fourth is with friends that i don't hang around with but talk to at school. There was a plus to each of them. The first hangout was fun because its a better relationship. The second has no worries about getting a ride. The third has friends that know you well and have a good relationship with. The fourth is better because i can get a closer relationship with some or with a special someone. "Its great hanging out with new people but its more great with the same old friends." i thought that was true but while i was writing down the pluses, it made the hangouts all too much the same. So now i found the solution to this pondering. Hanging out with people that respect you, have fun with you, talk to you, listen to you, and are considered friends to you, is the winner. Friends are friends no matter who you hang around with.

      Congratulations Class of 2004! After attending my sister's graduation and following her around taking pictures, it didn't seem like a sad moment. Everyone was happy and cheery because their family was there and that they got a high school diploma. I don't think i would cry at my graduation or senior year(lets hope i don't). The only person to make me cry is my sister. I've noticed that we're that close that if i see her cry, then i'll start crying. Its the same for her too...i would know from childhood retardness.

      Friends are great. It'll be so hard to leave them in two years when we all graduate. More friends will be awesome. Just being around friends messing with ordinary things will make my day, anyday. When my name gets mentioned by anyone, i feel special and cared about. A greeting like "hey" will mean nothing to me if it isn't "hey billy." I need the love. When i'm with friends, i don't care about how i look or what people think of me. What a wonderful thing to have to help remove those negative feelings and thoughts. Friends, tylenol, and sometimes family is my anti-maleverything. Maleverything, yes, my new word. it means everything that is bad, because of the prefix mal-. My teachers taught me well. They're like my friends too. Whoever said that friends have to be a certain age, race, religion, color, size, etc. is either very picky or self conscious about themselves....nvm...i hate it when people say maleverythings reflect how that person really is. Its stupid, it justifies the whole meaning of that action....so let me rephrase that: Whoever said that friends have to be a certain age....etc. is a very picky friend. Friends are not objects that can be thrown away, sold, or abused. You are a friend so follow the Golden Rule dammit.

      Hey hey. Ahoy hoy. my first blog for people to see i guess. You will have access to some parts of my head now. Don't abuse this priviledge. I will be talking about things that pop into my head. This will not be about my day and how my day went. It will be about current issues that i am thinking about and problems that i want to let out. You will be one of the few who will be able to read this. Aren't you excited? Here it goes....  Secret Admirers... Stupid unconfident losers who won't express their feelings. There are some things that you keep inside so others won't know about, but feelings? Feelings should be expressed out in the open instead of online, or hiding in a corner. Those secret admirers will sooner or later express their feelings, so why delay the time to? They want to take their time? right... The sooner you do things, the sooner it will be done. Just tell them or don't tell them at all. They go through all this trouble worrying about telling someone that they like him/her, and then take their time worrying about revealing themselves. Its not romantic, fun, or scary to tell someone that u like them but don't tell their who your are. Those people really don't know who their crush is or how they really are. It may be flattering to some but for others, like myself, its annoying as hell. Having to wonder who it is because thats the way i am, is annoying. It distracts me. I don't want it to but it does. Its the way i am. I'm a curious person and i show that by asking questions instead of having other do it for you or writing it on a piece of paper.   Stupid things like these do not express real feelings.      This is not to hurt anyones feelings. If it was, i would say so.

      Yesterday, first time at the beach this summer. I went with the family with relatives from Oakland. Me and Robert went surfing by ourselves while everyone else walked the boardwalk. There were no waves. It was as flat as a vietnamese girl's breasts. We went skim boarding instead. Skim boarding was how robert pulled his groin. Its kind of like jumping on a skateboard while its moving. It was pretty fun. I didn't do it well though. I only skimmed right twice. There were people watching. I felt uncomfotable. I fell a few times. Theres some parts of me that still hurts right now. My groin, shoulders, and arms hurt. I also got sunburned a little. There wasn't that much sun. I really wanted to go surfing too. At least now i know where to get the rentals and where to surf. No pictures this time, sorry.

      My house has cable now!!!! i'm so happy...yes..the little things in life. Comcast connected the wrong line or something so now we have B side but no A side. For the past weeks, i've been going to my cousin's house watching their cable. it was great. Now i can keep up with those commercials and shows and everything. I love watching television. Its not that much of my life. I can live without it. I've been reading Sohpie's World and Moby Dick. I finished Moby Dick (the cliffnotes), it was ok. The philosophical things were interesting. Sophie's World is more interesting. I can relate to Sophie. If there is a question that makes me really think, I'd wonder about the question, if i had time though. Summer school ended today too. This week is going to be great. I thought i wasn't going to have anything to do after summer schools over, but now the TV...hahaha. I wanted to do many random things like go to places for no reason. Theres a word for this, i know there is. I'm too lazy to find out what it is. I have my life to find out what things are. Thats my meaning of life, like Sophie, to understand the world around us. before our time is up.     Wow. From talking about cable to the meaning of life. Hah! It all relates. TV is half my life, the other half is........... living ? I don't know......all i know is that Moby Dick is a dick.

       My family (grandpa and grandma from dad's side, grandma from mom's side, mom, dad, cousin liana, her mom, her brother kevin) and I decided to go out. First we went to the Obon Festival. It was a little dissapointing but it was cool to see a Buddhist Church. We left after twenty minutes of being there. Then we went off to downtown Mtn. View to eat chinese food. It was ok. My cousins and I went off to get desserts at an Italian ice cream shop. I got the White Chocolate w/ Rasberrry Swirls Gelato. It was hella good. I love ice cream. After dinner, we decided to go up the Saratoga mountains to find the vista point that we tried finding last time with my cousin and his gf. We finally found it in like two hours of searching. We kinda missed the sunset but it was still nice. I don't need to describe it, you can see it for yourselves.        Funny looking clouds     In the car taking pics of the sunset     Another view     We're almost there. It looks soo nice.     Another view     We finally found it.      Left of the view from above......i know....oh my gah     A little right from the pic above     The family:  from left   to right  My dad, mom, mom's mom, dad's mom and dad, aunt, cousin     Another one      Everyone just looking at the view.      Too many pics of the sky      Everyone doing their own thing; talking, taking pics, and me taking a pic of them      Cousin Liana and her mom      Me and my mom      My mom and her boyfriend, my dad      My grandma and grandpa from my dad's side      My mom and her mom      With the flash, it makes the background look dark      With the flash off, it makes close things dark.

      Today was fcuking great. I went to a club in Sunnyvale with my friend. We were on the guestlist because he knew this girl that worked there. We got there at like 7. The doors opened at 7:30. I drank like forreal for the first time. It wasn't that gay crap like at weddings and family events. I was buzzed in like a minute. I didn't feel that bad. I only felt dizzy, i wasn't excited or anything but i didn't care about anything else tho. I didn't care about not bringing an ID. That was crazy. I used my friend's and i got in. Them dumbasses. Right when we got in i started dancing with this girl. She told me she goes to DeAnza. I told her i went there too....hahaha. I danced a couple more times with these other girls. My friend stole this one fine girl from me. I tried dancing with her later but she rejected me. That made me not have fun anymore, after i got rejected two more times. Some of the girls there were stinky. Girls aren't suppose to smell. haha. They were racist. Great experience. i want to do it again next week and then get numbers too, and also stay out longer.      You can find me in the club....

      i had a crazy dream last night. When i woke up, things that were happening in the dream was happening to me. The dream was about this guy that could kill people by hitting them on the back and they would die in a few days. All of a sudden, for some reason i forgot, he hit me on the back and it hurted. I knew i was going to die. My family was there and we were in the car. I was sitting next to my sister and i put my head on her shoulders and started to cry, thinking about how my life was wasted. I woke up with tears rolling down my cheeks still thinking that i would die. And my back hurted too. It was fcuking crazy. The craziest thing about that night was me crying. I've never heard of someone crying in their sleep over something that isn't even real. Maybe i just need to get more sleep.

      Sigh. i hate this weekend. Everything has been going downhill and more disappointments are coming. Friday was very very bad. I woke up to my dad screaming and yelling at me for asking for five more minutes of sleep. I go to summer school which i hate and took a test without studying for it beforehand. I come home to fall asleep until 5 and then i have my sister yell, scream, and hit me to wake up because she said we were late for my grandma's birthday dinner. I lock my door to change and my mom yells at me for locking the door. So now i'm pissed. I go to the dinner mad and pissed off. I don't talk to anyone but everyone is being noisy little bitches asking my mom what my deal was. She had the nerve to tell them that i didn't get enough sleep. Everyone is pissing me more by trying to talk to me.   The next day, i'm still mad, so i stayed home the whole day while the family went out. Later, I find out that the AP results are in. I get my mail, prayed to pass, run upstairs and open it to look everyone for a 3 or 4. The only number i found was a 1. I failed :'''( With the lowest grade possible, i failed. I chat with my friends and find out that others that didn't try as hard as me got a 2 instead of my low 1. I didn't deserve a 1. A 1 meant that i was stupid for college and even in the class. I really really hope that there was a mistake. How can i be in the "no recommendation" group? I just don't get it.   Later that night, we went to my cousin's grandma's 81st birthday party and it was ok. I saw my friend there but i didn't say hi or anything. I wanted to though.  Now  today, i'm waken up by my cousin calling me to go surfing. The bad news were that they needed a ride. I'm calling almost everyone to find a ride. No one wants to bring us. My last resort was my dad. Instead of straight up saying "no," he gives a long speech about how expensive it is, how far it is, how boring it will be, etc. I got mad and gave up. I really want to go surfing this summer and summer is almost over. I didn't even get to have my summer and now its almost over. I hate this.     My last resorts aren't making things better.

      What a night. I went with my cousins and my aunt to SF's Treasure Island. There was more fog than there was people. It kinda sucked but the fog and the water and the wind were cool, literally. While everyone else there were having BBQs, we had our Burger Kings. We were freezing our asses trying to eat next to the water. I also drank too much of my large sprite. We waited for about 3 hours until it got dark. There was this asian lady in a Oddysey that yelled at this mexican guy with his kid because they were playing with those sparks-on-a-stick next to her car. She was screaming that they were hurting her car. She made a big scene. The wind blew and the sparks touched the lady and she yelled "Ahhh! He hurt me! It hurt me!" It was hilarious. Everyone was laughing at her for being a dumbass. And the funniest part was when her husband came out to take a picture of her with the police and the mexican guy. I wanted to take a picture but that would seem stupider. That was the only thing exciting about that night. The fireworks sucked because the fog covered it and made it seem far. The pictures aren't that good because of the fog, wind, cold, and me having to use the restroom.

      You never really know someone by what they say online. Chatting online does not show true feelings or emotions.  You can't judge a person by what they say, especially online  Its the damn internet people! Don't judge me. For example, this one person thought i was a flirt and a dumbass because that was what she stereotpyed me to be when she met me and she didn't want me going out with her friend. So she gave a rating in her info as what she thought of me. wtf is that shit. The rating was a one but now its a 5 out of ten because she got to know the real me and not the one online not talking to anyone because i'm either eating or taking a shit. But still, I don't even wanna chat with her online or see her face after finding out that she's approving me to go out with her friend. Thats the stupidest bullshit ever. People should learn that sometimes what others say online don't reflect how they really feel.    EDIT OMG. Chatting online really doesn't express real feelings. People also misinterpret what others say too. Oh man, and i just did that to someone that saw me as more as a friend. She was telling me how she first saw me as a friend with benefits but she sees me as more than a friend. I totally misinterpretted that and thought that she said she saw me as a friend with benefits. She was like a friend with benefits to me too but she always thought i saw her as more than a friend. I told her how i felt because i thought she felt the same way. I read over what she said and now i feel like a complete dumbass. I asked her if she saw eye to eye with what i was saying before i figured out what she said to me and she said she did, but really didn't. MAN....i feel bad. /EDIT

         I’ll explain why I chose those words as her new name that I go by.           BIG -She  was  my big sister. She is no longer considered family in my book. She doesn’t even care about the family anymore. She’s always with her friends. The ones that she met only two months ago and now they’re BBFs…bitches, every single one of them. She yells and gives attitudes to my grandparents. No one in the family yells at the respected elders of the family. Nobody. I wanted to beat her with a stick so bad. Hurt her for hurting me.           MEAN -Ever since I was little, she was mean to me and others. She hurt me physically and mentally the most. She thinks her being mean to me is cool. She flaunts it to her friends at times. I never seemed to care because I didn’t want to fight with her and let her friends see the true  ANNA .           NASTY -She let her two guy friends that she met two months ago sleep at my house. But wait it gets worse. They all slept downstairs on the futon together having my grandparents waking them up. (Yes, the ones that were raised in traditional Chinese ways.) It gets even worse. She ignores my grandparents and they go upstairs to her room and sleep on her bed having my mom wake her up. My mom being ignorant and dumb doesn’t yell at her but tells her not to do it again. But at least she called her a slut.          SELFISH -Just as the word is, she thinks of no one but herself. She never thinks of me only when forced to by my parents. I’m supposed to be her brother but she looks at me like I’m her slave or someone that annoys her. Before, when I still considered her family, I would think of her when there were any family things. I know for a fact that she doesn’t because one time, she told my family not to pick me up from practice and that I would be okay. She was dead wrong. I stood at school waiting for an hour for a ride. My other family wasn’t home because their house was being painted. I had to walk two miles to my cousin’s house to see if everyone did leave me. They did.           BITCH -I don’t need to explain this. All the other adjectives put together makes this word.          Yes I hate her that much. Why now do I talk about this? Because now I’ve realized how much I can’t deal with her crap anymore. I can deal with her but not all the shit that she does to me and everyone.  I HATE YOU ANNA ONG!!!!!
