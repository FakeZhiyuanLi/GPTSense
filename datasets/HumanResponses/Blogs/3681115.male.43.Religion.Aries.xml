      I don't remember ever living in a place with so much wildlife before.  In the last few days, I have spotted ground hogs, a pair of coyotes, does and their young, chipmunks, cardinals, woodpeckers, black snakes.  This afternoon, as I tidied up around the tool shed I made a gruesome discovery.  A black snake had gotten tangled in a pile of deer net that I have been removing from the garden.  It died there and beetles and bugs were feasting on the rotting remains.  Yuck!  I picked the bundle up with a pole and proceeded to the dumpster.  I don't like snakes but I couldn't help feeling sorry for the horrible death the poor thing must have suffered.  Wild life is tough!  After that, NEV pointed out a dead pigeon in one of the flower-beds that I tend but I felt I had done enough funeral entrepreneur work for the day.  Somehow the deer have started getting very close to the buildings again.  I would have thought that they had enough food in the wild to stay away.  On the contrary, since the young have been born, they seem ever more daring in teasing the dogs and waiting until the last moment to scamper away as humans or vehicles approach.  They obviously lack predators to make them wise.  It feels so different to be so close to animals in their own environment...

      After supper, I went to sit in one of the Adirondack chairs under the red beech and do some reading in my bible.  I'm reading the first book of Samuel and the gospel of John for the moment.  The weather was just perfect.  I was wearing sandals and shorts and could feel insects and bugs checking out what's for dinner.  I should have sprayed DEET but I don't like the stuff.  The deer have fawned and for some odd reason come much closer to the house these days.  As they are the source of Lyme-disease causing ticks, I'll have to be more regular in using bug-repellent.  As I got up to go to church for compline, I watered the tomato and basil that I planted recently.  I had generously mulched the spot and, sure enough, our old Sally, a Labrador bitch, was sprawled on the fresh mulch.  Luckily, she doesn't like it so much when wet.  Today, she really upset Kevin, my fellow gardener by sprawling herself on hollyhock and variegated ornamental grass at the foot of the main building's facade.  We resort to sticking branches or metal trainers in the ground to make it uncomfortable for her to wreck a bed (well-named in her case).

      It would be nice if we could tend a small vegetable garden.  But things being as they are, I have decided to just add to the existing herb garden by the kitchen.  Monday I bought a plant of Billy Boy tomatoes and a pot of basil.  It was after compline on Wednesday when I got around to amending a patch of soil and plant them.  The idea is to enable our cook to step out of the kitchen and help himself to fresh herbs and garnishes.  I thoroughly mulched the patch in the hope of keeping more moisture for the plants and reducing my weeding chores.  Next to the church, a critter is digging holes under the narsturtiums and one of them is starting to look pretty sorry.  I put logs over the hole in the hope that the tunneler would move to another neighborhood.  We'll see...

      Last week-end, NEV worked in the garden with a woman who regularly worships with us and loves gardening. She was here with her daughter and helped NEV in the Peace Garden. While they were shopping for plants this lady spotted a Celtic cross that she donated for the monastery. It features Adam and Eve and all the lovely intertwined motifs of the Celtic style.  We kept it by the church entrance a few days until NEV thought it would look nice in the Bell Tower bed. We placed it in the back of the bed somewhat off-center. It looks wonderful! It is set against the dry stone wall and the rambling roses. It completes the garden perfectly and gives it character while acting as a signal for the church. It looks quite Celtic to me.  We looked for a Celtic saint by whom to name the garden. I suggested Columba who is allegedly the author of a monastic rule and also gave his name (Saint Colomban in French) to the seaside village in Brittany where I spent so many Easter vacations as a child.  We have surrounded the cross with a few more plants: - transplanted sages, - ivory white nicotinas, - a beautiful fountain-like ornamental grass: Dwarf Gracillimus, - another yellow yarrow.  I'll say a little prayer to Columba next time I stop by his garden.

      Near the entrance of the Monastery is a rocky outcrop crowned by a white crucifix.  It is visible from Route 9W.  We call it Calvary Garden.  A few weeks ago, a group of volunteers helped us clear it from the plants and weeds that occupied it.  They were not appropriate to the rocky nature of the garden.  Last week, I dug up the dirt and mixed it with sand, peat and pot soil.  Yesterday, a guest who asked for physical work covered it with 7 bags of pine mulch.  He put a layer of newspaper under the mulch to keep weeds from easily coming back through the mulch.  I underestimated how much mulch he'd need and I will have to get more.  The planting of that garden will probably have to wait for next year.  But in the meantime, we have transplanted a bunch of day lilies and planted the following: - Sempervivum - Hen and Chicks plant, - A small pink sedum plant that goes well in the nooks of the rocks. Stonecrop "Dragon's Blood" Sedum spurium. - an ornemental grass; Little Bunny Grass (Pennisetum alopecuroides "Little Bunny"), - "Bath's Pink Cheddar" Pinks (Dianthus gratianopolitanus "Bath's Pink")

      In the Bell Tower bed: - Tradescantia Andersonia "Bilberry Ice". I omitted to deadhead it and as a result it is now heavily into fruiting. Maybe I should remove the fruit to let it gather forces. - Achillea Moonshine (a lemon-yellow type of Yarrow) - Coreopsis Sunrine (double, golden yellow flowers that keep coming back if deadheaded) - Alchemilla Mollis (Lady's Mantle, chartreuse flower sprays, beautiful foliage when dewy or hanging on to rain-drops) - Pansies (the early workers of this bed, they flowered abundantly through early June, new flowers appeared as the withered ones were removed) - Hyacinths - Tulips - Marigolds ("Disco Maritta", "Disco Queen", "Disco Flame" and "Bonanz Yellow". That horticulturist was stuck in the seventies...) - Lilium Longiflorum (Easter Lily salvaged from the church after Easter week. Hopefully, it will come back to bloom next summer) - Dusty Millers - Geranium x Rosanne PPAF (whatever that means about this hardy geranium)

      Near the kitchen, a four-feet tall sustaining wall creates a flower bed at chest level.  It's ideal for the cooks to collect herbs and condiments for the meals.  It required a lot of weeding.  A group of visitors who volunteered gardening work helped us remove a lot of spearmint that was taking over half the bed.  Across the back driveway, off the kitchen, we planted a Linden tree.  It's about 3 feet high and so far, the deer have let it live...  We planted it during the Order's chapter this year in May.  Two of us held hands and prayed a blessing to it and to the order.  I'm hoping it will eventually give shade  to the kitchen and the pantry during the warmest hours of the day.  Eventually, it will smell sweet and delicious when it blooms.  Who knows, maybe monks in a couple of decades will be able to brew some linden tea from its fruit.  This season's plantings in the Kitchen Garden: - one plant of Billy Boy Tomatoes to check it out - Tarragon - Rosemary - Basil - Rhubarb

      The Welcome Patch is an almond-shaped island at the intersection of our driveway and Route 9W. It had been fallow for a while and other than a lovely Japanese Maple it sported lots of weeds.   In late April, I dug it up and discovered good, easy soil with lots of resident earthworms. As everywhere else in the garden, lots and lots of stones and rocks are harvested whenever the ground is dug up. Also, when it rains, more stones surface... I now piles stones and rocks next to whatever bed I'm working in to motivat myself by the amount of rock removed. Sometime, I'll use the rock piles to decorative effect somewhere else.   After adding a good deal of peat moss and some cow manure I proceeded to plant lots of stuff for fast effect. We wanted it to look its best for the monastery centennial in mid-May.   I've added some plants to it since and it has come into its own as a colorful feature to greet people on their way in and out of our home.   Planted this season in the Welcome Patch:  - 2 Azaleas (1 Azalea Girard's Hot Shot) - Portulacas (mixed colors, double flowers)  - Marigolds (with disco-related varietals names...)  - Petunias ("Plum Madness", "Dreams Red", "Summer Madness")  - Goldstrum Black-Eyed-Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida "Goldstrum")  - Shasta Daisies  - Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia "Superba", silvery foliage, blue flowers on airy, wispy stems), Caraonna Sage (Salvia nemorosa "Caradonna", violet flowers on purple stems) and another blue flower salvia - Radican Creeping Euonymus (Euonymus fortunei "Radicans") - Ground-cover conifer&nbsp; (Juniper Procumbens Nana)  YAR received an extra length of garden hose and has been watering the bed whenever needed. The regular watering realy helped.

      KEV gave the garden its name on St Benedict's day. It had been worked on by retreatants to his "Praying with Creation" retreat. Since then, he's added a dial of river stones indicating the cardinal directions.  The garden is a long flower bed flanking the downhill side of the driveway as it reaches the monastery's entrance. It starts under the trees and then meanders towards the oval lawn that is in front of the entrance.  This year, we have planted: - Hollyhock, - Veronica "Sunny Border Blue", - Lavender, - Echinacea, - Black-eyed Susans,
