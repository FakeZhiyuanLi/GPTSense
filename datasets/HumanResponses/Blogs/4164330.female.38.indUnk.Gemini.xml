						   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we," Bush said.  Ms. Run is in a state of pure enchantment at the latest words of wisdom and comfort disgorged by the US's Selected President.   Well of course "our people" are thinking of more and better ways to "harm our country."  What else is the GOP  for ferchrissakes???????  In much the same way that Rajiv Gandhi's assassination was announced everywhere but in India itself, Ms. Run learned of Dubya's latest rhetorical triumph from Her Spies in Blighty who were having a right old cackle over it.  Can you spell Vast-Right-Wing-Conspiracy anyone? The DNC seems, from one's vantage point, deep in the Stacks of Widener Liberry, to have pursued its usual one-celled ameoba-esque Rapid Response.  And done nothing with this gem beyond price.  HellOOOOOOOOOO!  Big John?  Anyone Awake out there?? Nice guys finish 567 votes behind in Florida, according to the Maths geniuses on the Supreme Court.  Oy.  Ms. Run's analysis is that far from being yet another Dyslexic malapropism, Dubya's latest is a good ol' fashioned Freudian Slip, and thus a window into the weevil-infested recesses of his other semi-conscious.  Of course his peeps, like the house of bin-Saud, the Enron top brass, the Chalabi family, and the good people of Halliburton are into doing harm (to all but their own stock portfolios and $25,000 shower curtains).  In a related connection, Ms. Run is kicking up her heels at the news (from McNeil-Lehrer so it must be true), that Ahmed Chalabi, the Panty-gon's paragon of Iraqi democracy is on the lam from the Law in Iran.  The so-charming Dr. Alawi (who has just enhanced Iraqi democracy by kicking al-Jazeera off the air in his patch) wants to invite him to  party at Abu Ghraib Big House.  Too bad Pvt. Lindy England has such a capacious bun in the oven that she won't be on hand to lead old Ahmed around on a string.....Meoowwww.  Ms. Run just can't help feeling a little "Mare-ish" now and again.  She is now off to contemplate strategic shoe-purchases to be undertaken with Overwhelming Force when she returns to the land of her birth, aided in these scholarly endeavours by a tincture or three.

						   In the face of the continuing Dubya Dystopia, Dawn Run (who is to be imagined reclining upon her luxuriously appointed pink cloud that hovers perpetually over the final furlong at Cheltenham Racecourse) feels compelled to follow in the footsteps of those 18th and 19th Century poison-pens par excellence, J. S. Buckingham, Hickey, Junius, Publius, (and all the other "us's"), Oscar Wilde and H. L. Menken, et al--and bore her friends, enemies and none of the above with her entirely unfair, unbalanced, and ill-researched opinions now and again.   Given the fact that the above mentioned Ms. Run is far too ambivalent and given to procrastinational tendencies to actually attempt real Op-Eds, she has decided to vent her considerable spleen in cyberspace.  She is entirely responsible for the opinions, if not the events that inspire them, of this ill-conceived column of public disinformation.  And she hopes John Ashcroft, Michael Powell and co. at the Dept. of Injustice, The FCC,The FBI and all of those other places are really pissed off by said considerable spleen.   And what the hell is UP with the Terror Alert of last week that actually turns out to be something yellow, slimy, unidentifiable, and dating from 4 years ago that somebody at Homeland Security found in a polythene bag at the back of the Fridge???  To the  Relevant Parties : Is there any connection with the fact that Booz*Alien Consulting Inc. has been hired by the Regime to stream line the US intelligence services?  I think not, Forsooth!
