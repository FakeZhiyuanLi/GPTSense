      -The Voice Within- CHRISTINA AGUILERA Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall Young girl, it's all right Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly  When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream  Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems No one ever wants or bothers to explain Of the heartache life can bring and what it means  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl, don't hide You'll never change if you just run away Young girl, just hold tight And soon you're gonna see your brighter day  Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid No one reaches out a hand for you to hold When you're lost outside look inside to your soul  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Yeah... Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go As long as you're learning You'll find all you'll ever need to know  You'll make it You'll make it Just don't go forsaking yourself No one can stop you You know that I'm talking to you  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall here guys, this is a nice song here.. i think u shld know.. lol.. enjoy..

Lord, please save me.. haha.. today's paper is science.. i'm confident that i'll pass but not too well though.. then lessons.. argh.. what is wrong with them?! they are so supposed to let us go home instead of keepin us back in sch.. aniwaeeee, today's chinese lesson is so  >..prob it's bcos of Mrs Er at the back of the class observin how we *learn*.. that's why she didn't let us copy the whatever millions and millions of words that we usually do for her classes.. we don't even understand what we are copyin but we jus copy for the sake of copyin.. LoL.. that's why my chinese is so bad... then Gurgit's class.. last 2 periods.. as usual, she's a PAIN IN THE ASS.. or rather, PAIN IN -MY- ASS.. LoL.. i think that Xiang Yun went too far today.. it's like she's bein defiant to her mother... her attitude i mean.. weird.. i dun know why but i think she likes Sebastian..  I hope to see him again tmr.. hehe.. and by the way, if u are readin this Shehana, thanx for ur graffitti.. it's really cool.. sH signin off.. peace ppl.. V

      "Baby Boy"  From the day that I saw you I knew that we would pursue Cause the chemistry we felt that day Felt so real, and so true Looking back on a year we spent together How it’s been, what we went through Although we’ve had our little ups and downs We’ve still pulled through  Baby girl you’re my world my everything I wanna lace you with diamonds and every ring Give you everything you dream and fantasize Cause you can tell me that you love me Looking in my eyes You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you You keep on loving me, I’ll keep on loving you Keep doing what you do, I feel your whole aura And I can’t wait to hook up again tomorrow baby - what  [Chorus:] My love for you will never end You’ll always be a part of me As long as time keeps on passing by You’ll always be my baby boy.  Everytime I look at you, I can’t believe I’ve found a love so true (and) I took my time to put my trust in you I must admit it was so hard to do And every minute that I spend with you You make me believe I have nothing to loose and Deep down I always knew that you would be mine  Do you believe in destiny Because I got a funny feeling this was meant to be Without you I’d be lost, I need you next to me Preferably in the house full of luxuries and little kids From day one I was sprung, knew you was gonna be one Cause my heart spoke for the very first time in a long while And every time you smile, I can see us walking up the aisle with you carrying my child C’mon  [Chorus]  If you were to go, I don’t know You’re the only one who sweeps me off my feet Makes my soul go weak The only one who makes my heart wanna beat and I, I could never live without you You know that what I feel has to be true Cause you’re my, my sweet love  Ever since the first time, that I looked into your eyes I knew that you were gonna be mine Feeling you from the inside, when you’re not by my side You’re the only girl that’s on my mind I never knew a love like this, a love so strong A vision so picture perfect it could never be wrong Along the way, you’re gonna see you belong with Jay I might have to marry you one day baby eh..  [Chorus / Outro]  this song is sooo cool.. reminds me of.. u know who..

      "Say It Isn't So"  Skies are dark it's time for rain Final call you board the train Heading for tomorrow I wave goodbye to yesterdays Wipe the tears you hide your face Blinded by the sorrow  How can I be smiling like before When baby, you don't love me anymore  Say it isn't so Tell me you're not leaving Say you changed your mind now That I am only dreaming That this is not goodbye This is starting over If you wanna know I don't wanna let go So say it isn't so  Ten to five atleast we tried We're still alive but hope just died As they close the door behind you Whistle blows and tons of steel Shake the ground beneth the wheels As I wish I never found you  How can I be smiling when you're gone Will I be strong enough to carry on  Miles and miles to go before I can say, Before I can lay my love for you to sleep Oh, darling oh I got miles and miles togo Before anyone will ever hear Me laugh again  Gawd.. i love gareth gates.. esp his songs.. so touchin.. LoL..

      "Will You"  See you sittin' next to the window in the bedroom  She breaks down - breaks down  Crying over something and starin' into nothin'  Afraid now - hate now  Wanting, needing, haunting, it's killing me  Faking what has happened to live the life like that man  I'll break down - It's fake now   Will you, will you love me tomorrow?  So Will You, Will you stay with me today?   Fade in and out of reason to fight the way she's feelin'  She breaks down - breaks down  Going through the motions and holding onto hopes  and her dreams now - somehow  Shaken, mistaken, forsaken, it's killing me.  Wishing you could change, but he's always been this way  If you leave now - I'll drown   Will you, will you love me tomorrow?  So Will You, Will you stay with me today?  Will you, will you be here tomorrow?  So Will You, you remember yesterday?   Yesterday! Yesterday!  Yesterday! Yesterday!   This time, I'm sorry  This time, I'm sorry  This time, this time, I'm sorry for this time  This time, this time, I'm sorry  This time I'm sorry!   Will you, Will you love me tomorrow?  So Will You, Will you stay with me today?  Will you, Will you be here tomorrow?  So Will You, you remember yesterday?   Will you? [x6] So Will You?  Will you? [x6]   hey all, nice song here.. guess y'all know by now.. hehe..

      HEY PPL! sorry for not updatin for a pretty long time.. it's jus a busy week for me.. HOLIDAYS!! hehe.. now.. let's get this thingy updated.. ok.. so.. i spent like 4 to 5 days at shehana's place cos her parents are like overseas.. so they entrusted her into my hands.. hehe.. i'm very responsible ok??? so i stayed there from Sunday to thursday.. had plenty to do cos we went out most of the time.. either that or we slack at home.. it's kinda fun.. kinda like a slumber party.. ;) but on tues, we went for the class chalet thingy.. poor luke.. he must have lost lots of paper(money) cos he was so the one to book the chalet. he must be coerced by Sebastian..hehe. abt 8 pple didn't pay up.. and i'm beginnin to suspect someone.. hehe.. so basically at the chalet, we had not much to do.. jus laze ard.. didn't get to go to the theme park cos it drizzled on the first day.. then the second day we didn't get to go too.. cos the stupid netball gals foiled my plans by suggestin cycling.. poor shehana, she didn't get to do it for the first time.. so we went home.. i was very tired.. cos i didn't sleep much.. i was like 15 mins knock out then i'm back on again.. it's very uncomfortable.. particularly on a one seater sofa.. then later in the mornin at abt 3 plus??? i dunno which kind soul gave up her place ( a two seater sofa) to me! and i slept like a baby till 6.. hehe.. but that *kind* soul gave it to me cos she found a beta place to sleep which is one a 3 seater sofa!!! that woman! hehe.. niwae, was grately to her.. y'all know why i didn't sleep in any of the 2 rooms? cos one was occupied by the hoard of netball girls! (humpf!) and another was occupied by XY and YC.. hehe.. 2 of them.. who'd bear to disturb them.. hehe.. and i discovered many secrets at the chalet... particularly personal ones.. who'd would have thought that a chalet could be so fRuiTfUL?? hehe.. so i went home on wed and was almost drawn by fatigue to sleep on the mrt on the way home.. but due to the music blastin in my ears, i was kept awake.. and many pple kept lookin at me and shehana cos the music was so loud that i think they could hear.. hehe.. and shehana was like bobbin her head and me tappin my foot to the rhythm.. quite an enjoyable ride home.. so the next day i went home and was immensely drained.. emotionally, phycically and mentally.. lol... pretty dramatic.. i really miss *him* alot.. i only saw him 2 times durin the hols.. once was when he's in for basketball prac and another was when he was playin basketball near he's area.. hmm.. i'm so missin him right now.. he's so hot and cute.. haha.. lucky me.. he also had a class chalet goin on.. and poor him.. he's didn't sleep for the whole night.. haiz.. wish i could see him now.. i'm signin off now.. see y'all back in school.. GC forever.. ;)

      "Over My Head (Better Off Dead)"  What happened to you You've played the victim for so long now in this game What I thought was true Is made of fiction and I'm following the same  But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in I'm not sure where I should begin I'm fallin' I'm fallin'  [Chorus:] Now I'm in over my head with something I said Completely misread I'm better off dead And now I can see How fake you can be This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me  It's none of my concern Don't look to me because I don't believe in fame I guess you never heard I've met our makers they don't even know your name  But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell I'd say my time has served me well I'm fallin' I'm fallin'  [Chorus]  [Bridge] This came long before Those who suffer more I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare  What's with my disgrace I lost the human race No one plans for it to blow up in their face  Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces  [Chorus]  Over my head Better off dead  Over my head Better off dead  ALRIGHT!  i love this song.. so totally expressin my feelings right now..

      Hiya ppl.. sorry 4 not updatin my blog the past few days.. was pretty busy with sch stuff and personal stuff.. ever since sch started, many new thingys (happy, sad, etc etc) happened, many new emotions that i have not felt b4 were stirred alive.. and so on so forth.. so the first day of school.. nth much.. same old routine and nth much.. and guess what? 'he' had extra classes after sch on the FIRST day of term 2.. i can't believe it.. what is wrong with hss.. then the next day, tues.. was openin my front door and all set to go to school when i noticed my dwarf hamster squashed at the corner.. didn't know how Misha escaped and got herself there.. she was already dead of course.. she's a very cute little one.. jus the length of my little finger and yours.. was a little brownish gold.. and very timid.. my bro cleaned up for me.. wasn't a bloody mess.. ed was of course pissed with me cause i woke him up early in the morn jus to clean up.. then he scolded me the f word.. then he asked me to wipe what he has cleared.. i was already late for school.. so i jus went off, leavin him seethin with anger and cursin me more.. whatever it is, thanx for helpin me.. although he's sometimes a pain in the ass.. i was very upset and still am.. but u would never guess what happened in school.. i cried at the parade square.. but pls, it was not filled with ppl.. jus u know.. a grp of ppl here and there and shehana and anita were there for me.. i guess they were very surprised cos it's the first time they have ever seen me cry.. gals, i hope that i didn't scare ya.. lol.. i'm still missin Misha.. kinda guilty also cos didn't really have the time to actually play with her and observe and stuff.. guess she was jus this smalll that she's able to squeeze out of the cage.. still missin her.. i'm also missin him.. dunno how's his studies and stuff.. hope that no gals or whatever is distractin him from what he's doin right now.. hehe.. he got a new hairstyle.. though not very 'in', he's cute.. but i think he shld use the super hard wax.. the gel or wax he's usin right now isn't really gonna last his hair the whole day.. lol.. i noticed that it was kinda 'saggin'.. =) miss him and Misha lots... today, Mr Darren Chong didn't come to school.. because he got rashes and swellings due to sth he ate which contained peanuts.. i dunno what is wrong with this male human being, but as a matter of fact, he's allergic to peanuts.. so weird.. how can a guy be allergic to peanuts.. hmm.. ("-)... so today's happenings weren't much.. same old routine again.. i'm so missin him right now.. he so totally went home at abt 4 plus.. which is kinda late and i'm so pissed.. i dunno why.. anyway, hope that i dun wake up tmr and go to school recountin on what happened to Misha on tues morn again.. and always walkin to school woth a heavy heart.. *sigh*.. me signin off.. =(

      love ma hammies.. today, my bro booked outta camp.. the eldest one.. always out durin the weekends.. hm.. came back with Mandee.. then they ate at the table and made soo much noise.. lol.. in actual fact, i have not carried one of my *toddler* hammies.. neither one of them.. but today, i carried one of them and the amazin thing was that it did not bite me.. i have been paranoid since the day Xiao Bai bit me.. it was a sharp pain and almost bleeing.. sigh... but then, everything's alright now.. hehe.. my mummy hammy's 2 little newborn babies are so adorable..  it's amazin to watch a hamster grow.. so cute.. when they are born, they are jus teeny weeny bodies.. they are very raw.. red in coulor, no fur, no hair.. their eyes and ears sealed off.. but as time passes, their eyes and ears will open up to the world.. hair starts to grow.. before u even know it, they have grown doube their size, runnin abt in tha cage, eatin from the food bowl instead of suckling from their mum's nipple.. sigh.. they are jus sooooo adorable.. u can spend hrs watchin them.. it's a kind of commitment when u keep a hammy.. i'm not very committed, i admit.. well.. ever since the babies were borne, i was more committed.. guess that i needed sth new each time to keep me there...  things between be and the girls [jessica and stephanie only] have improved.. they are not blamin me for scoldin them sooo many times in tha past, i guess.. we started out with a simple hello, bye,.. then we started to smile at each other, teasing each other.. guess that's jus friendship.. lol.. i'm GLAD.. being a prefect is not easy.. sigh.. really miss the pri sch times.. not soo hectic.. but guess that's jus life right? u need to go through everything..   sigh.. i really miss him alot.. 1 WHOLE MONTH of NOT seein him.. sigh sigh sigh..

      holla peeps.. back at home now.. now then i start bloggin cos my friggin com modem thingy had sth wrong with it.. so f up.. hm.. anyway, nth much happened in sch.. except that i saw him quite a number of times.. hehe.. there was this once that he was jus behind me and our faces were so closed cos he turned in ma direction while i turned in his!!! HAHAHAHAAH.. lol.. okie.. i'm goin crazy.. lol.. aniwae, let's update.. today, kinda bad day, cos i scolded Fang Fan til she cried.. and ma frens say that i'm losin it.. i jus wanna scream at them sayin, DUDES, WERE U GUYS PREFECTS BEFORE? IF U ARENT, GET THE F OUTTA MA FACE!!!! U GuYS SUCK AT SCOLDING! EVERYTHING ALSO SCARED!!! but, of course i didnt.. anyways, i scolded that *woman* cos she screamed, i think.. i was in 1e2 doin ma duty by keepin them quiet.. and they were quiet in a short while.. then i heard a LOUD, SCREECHY, FEMINIE scream.. and from then onwards, i knew who to relate the scream to... it's one of the 4 girls.. dun say that i'm bias. i know them. i even know how they the styles that they whine, scream and so on. dude, i think i can be their mum. anyways, i went into e3 and shushed them quiet.. more like shoutin at them to keep quiet. then i turned to the right corner of tha room and asked who scream. they didnt reply and i said that if the person didn't own up, i'm gonna relate to the 4 girls and they are goin to get it big time.. i know that it's unfair.. but then, it's the only way to get them to own up.. i know it sounds toopid to pursue into these kids of stuff... but the scream was sooo loud that i could hear it through the walls! imagine a teacher teachin, what would they do? back to the story.. we argued, me and fang, then we argued to the point that she gave up and decided to use tears to resort to resolve the matter.. DUDE, THAT OFFICIALLY GAYYYYY! i REPEAT. GAY. anyway, she cried and cried.. like i tortured her or sth.. anyways, i was not merciful.. then i dunno what happened, i think everyone started walkin then everyone started screamin.. i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO pissed, i shouted for them to SHUT UP. and they did. and i called those eho shouted to come out offa class and see me.. they were the chairman, vice chair and Jacob.. sigh.. didn't scold them.. jus talked to them.. even the chairman said that Fang fan was the one who screamed. sometimes, i think that Fang can join the actresses academy cos she can sct soooo well.. then kenneth, jason and terry came and asked us to go back ta class cos lessons were goin on and that if we dont, the teachers are goin to friggin hell nag.. we didnt really obey cos it was maths period.. but then, we had to go back.. dude, what choice do we have? lol..   yea.. headed back ta class.. and mrs low was jus gettin started on her SPEECH.. dude, she sucks.. anyway, she had this test thingy again.. for us la.. then we were like arguin dun wan la.. we wanna use the pass that we had won for the class of the term thingy.. to postpone the friggin testy.. then she started to reprimand us.. dude, do u know how long did she take? 2 WHOLE periods.. she was givin us a CRAP talk.. talkin abt how lazy we are, what must plan our future.. then blah².. we were like so pissssssssed.. by the end of the first period of her talk, most of us had our heads on that table.. lol.. includin me.. and the most amazin thing happened.. shehana, me and the others slept.. as in SERIOUSLY! lol.. i slept for like 15 min's i think.. lol.. yea. the talk was thaaaaaaaaaaat booooooooooooring.. sigh.. then the bell rang at the end of her 2 periods and we were instantly awake!!! lol.. then art.. tOOOOOOOOPID heng.. i think he has some grudges against me.. asshole.. roy, sebas, marzuq, shehana and me were laughin over some pics on the newspaper.. it was not obscene pics, mind u.. jus a pic of the species pic, and then he gave us that tone [i'm-pissed-but-i'm-talkin-to-ya-in-a-nice-way] then said what.. blah blah blah.. okie.. we were makin noise and that we were in tha lib, but then, he could have jus told us to keep quiet instead of givin us mroe CRAP talk.. yea. WE WERE PISSED. AND WE STILL ARE. basket.. i was jus beginnin to like him as a teacher but then he has built up the hatred in me for him again.. ka ni na.. i hate him.. sigh.. i'm sooooooooo tried of entertainin the teachers.. speakin of entertainin, i have ta entertain ms shirley chua AGAIN! cos the fang fan complained to her abt me.. sucky.. in tha wrong but wont admit.. sigh.. this is like the second time that i'm facin her.. and the first time concerns the 4 gurls too.. sigh.. but too bad for them, the first round, i won. so for the second round tmr, BRING IT ON. i'll be waitin. LOL. sigh.. why are they givin me such teeny weeny challenges? gimme more challengin ones!! i'll be waitin.. i'm outty.. ciao..

Everytime, whenever i'm doing ma duty after recess, i'm supposed to check the attires of the pupils and to check to see if they've brought any food or drink back ta class... and these gals.. i catch them everyday.. for not tuckin in their shirts.. and they find the fact that it's amusin.. everytime i scold them, they smile and laugh and snicker.. damn it.. i jus want to take off ma tie and jus SLAP and SLAP and SLAP them each on their faces at least 50 times.. but i controlled maself and told maself not to abuse ma authority... do u know how hard is it to do that? dammit.. anyway, they even enjoyed the so-called game which is to untuck their friends' shirts! [they do it among themselves] that is like sooooooooo sick.. psycho.. wtf.. and when i scold them, they like ta retort that they are not in the wrong and whatsoever.. SHIT them.. bunch of wannabe ah lians.. freakos.. hmph.. then one day, mr Tse finally saw their true colours and helped me settle tha prob! muahahahhhahahaha.. u lose, i WIN! or-b!! lalalaalal.. hmph.. hm.. but they've not really changed much.. there were actually 5 of them.. but one of them, Stephanie, was not so bad.. at least she knows when ta stop.. there's hope for her... lol.. well.. abt today.. ponteng sch.. y'know why? cos i'm friggin tired.. i went for the Black Eyed Peas concert yesterday.. friggin cool.. and i went home at abt 10 or 11? cant' remember.. but i do know that i was exhausted and i slept at round 1.. sigh.. and this morn, i tried ta wake up.. but to no avail.. lol.. i was like a dead person sleepin.. even ma granny's thunderous voice couldn't wake me up.. perhaps it jarred me up as little.. cos i remembered her askin me if i wanna go ta sch anot.. and i replied in teochew 'mai laaaaaa' and i continued sleepin.. lol.. hm.. guess i'll stop here.. but i have lotsa to share with y'all.. be back later.. ma stomach's growling.. hehe.. ciao.. love 2E2!! rock ONNNNN

      y'know.. the BEP thingy??? concert and shit.. well, they sooo totally rawk.. Dan even got pics taken with them.. sigh.. i'm sooooooooooooo jealous..   i'm still wonderin whether i shld or not.. hmm.. should i or should i not..   i have nth to do right now.. so sian.. hm. mayb i can tell u a little bit more abt ma eng teacher,   Mrs Seah Eng Lan  . lol.. here goes..  hm.. she's basically a nice person.. jus that when she's angry, the bias side of her jus creeps out.. yea..  BIAS .. well.. she will scold those who aren't so good in their Queen MOther's language.. and she exceptionally nice to those who are reall gooooooood.. yea.. that's jus her.. but she's real understandin too.. well, sometimes.. can get really really really  fierce .. her demands are pretty high.. i think that my eng is goin up bcos of her.. hehe.. not that i'm sayin that Mr Darren Chong is lousy, it's jus that.. y'know... yea.. i'd choose Mrs Seah for teaching wise, but Mr CHong, for personality wise.. sorry DC...  abt Ms Evelyn Wu.. ma science teacher... Half the time that she's teachin, i'm not listenin.. so what if i listened? i wouldn't get it too.. she's jus.. in my opinion, not suited to teach... sigh.. i really dun understand what she teaches most of tha time.. simple chapters, of course, the contents are easy to grasp.. but the harder ones, spare me.. i'd rather Traven Loh teach me though he has that xia lan and despicable face.. she jus drones on and on and on and on.. then she will suddenly pop this question, " Do u all understand?????"  the class by then was already half asleep.. so nobody answered.. then she assumes that everyone understands and jus continues.. sigh.. soooooooooooooooooooooo boooooooooooooriiinnng... but can't really blame her.. i think that this is her first few yrs of teachin??? she was ma science teacher too last yr.. and last yr, my grp of frens, really gave her a hard time.. trust me.. u dun wanna know.. there was this once that she was on the verge of tears.. but this yr, everything's alright now.. it's all jus abt her teaching.. sorry ms wu..  sigh.. so borin.. anything to interest me, anyone?  i'm outty..
