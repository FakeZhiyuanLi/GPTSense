      Well this weekend was exciting. on friday Coral John and Matt came over and we made fun of the Harry Potter 1 (even thoguh i love harry potter)and went downt to the park. It was great, we tried box sledding, but the boxes were to big and would fly away in mid sled. Matt slid off of his box and got his back all nastyfied. John had mad monkey skills in tree jumping and such! wow. okie moving on. After box sledding Matt and I decided to climb "The Cliff" it was difficult, but we are alive. once we all met up at the top we went home. I wanted to take everyone to blood hill, but we had to vamanos. that is about all that i did on friday. On saturday i went to the hell zone, or otherwise known as the mall. i hate shopping at the mall, unless im with my friends and we dont really shop, we just run around looking like jackasses! its a barrel of monkeys. After the hell zone i came home and watched TV for 3 or 4 hours. I eventually got tired of watching TV so i called murphy and we went to the movies and saw shrek 2. I LOVED IT! shrek 2 totally rocks my socks! On sunday i went with nicole (accent on the e) to the farm to clean and stuff. At the farm theres a new girl and her and her parents are cray-z! i hate them. her dad is just wierd and is a crack hore. but her mom has "large physical proportions" and decides to bleach wood. Why the hell do you want bleached wood, its brown and nothing will change that, or atleast bleach wont. And why even bleach it?! the goats were just goin to shit and pee on it! owell. anyways, we got locked in the chicken coop and since im, as nicole says, anarexic I was able to reach my hand thru and unlock the gate. wow how dandy is that! later when nicole's goat came she discovered he was huge and by far the biggest out of all the goats. Since her goat was so huge and glorious, we named it Estaban! oh yea!! Later more on that day we went to Great America to discover we really hate it there. We went on a total of 4 rides (even w/ a disability pass NO LINES) and the majority of the time we sat down and ate while watching all the messed up people. We decided we really like fat people. They are funny. But the new words for fat are "large physical proportions". so yea. Nicole cut her toe and needed a bandade so we went to the "red house". at the "red house" there were wierd old fashion rocking chairs that no one ever sits in and a creepy guy who was creepy. here is our conversation with the wierd guy:  Nicole:  hi can i have a bandade?  Cray-z Man:  why, do you have a blister?  Nicole:  blista?! I dont have a blista! (sounding offended)  Cray-z Man:  okie? what happened?  Nicole:  i cut my toe  Me: and shes bleeding perfusly onto the floor HURRY!! then he gave us a bandade and we left. on our way out we got trapped by the parade and we werre confused. On monday nothing happened except writing the glorious 6 page essay assigned by my favorite freakishly tall teacher, Mr.Cotter! here is a shout out to Mr.Cotter, I HATE YOU!!! EVERYBODY DOES!!!!! okie, im done now. go frolic in the tulip fields now!

      well well well. you have come to my blogspot have you? well, yea, i guess you have! Today i realized that all i need in this life, (well, to make me estactically happy for atleast a month)is a pet lobster named larry. yes, larry the lobster! it is perfect. i will teach him tricks and he will udancicycle in low flying clouds!!! well. last friday was a hayday of fun frolicing goodness! it all began with a minimum day and matt slipping and landing flat on his face. after that enjoyable event (I LOVE KATE SWEE) we all took the bus to johns house and enjoyed viewing the public hore sign. a lot of people were at our par-t, but im not going to list them all because im retarded and may leave some1 out. but anyways, we went to the park and watched john talk to a tree (2x) which was also quite entertaining. after we got tired of killing the poor willow tree, we froliced to nob hill. well that was just a HUGE barrel of monkeys! to begin our session of scarring and frightening innocent bystanders we bought a huge tub of ice cream and began to consume. ricky i think especially enjoyed licking his spoon all sexy like. after eating so much ice cream that we all were cray-z (except nicole who lived to conquer the ice cream) ate saltines. FACT: it is nearly impossible to eat 6 saltines in 1 min. now go try! ok. on our 3rd expidition into the store for more saltines, ashley decided to have a sample of "THE TUNA SANDWHICH OF DEATH!!!!" and well, that wasnt pretty. she ran outside and puked in the bushes........ for a long time. then, stupid me, i sat in some! oh boy! so i was htrowing up in the bushes also. ashley had throw up a little in the empty ice cream tub, so we threw it away, but nicole wanted to keep it of course. so she went digging through the garabage. and to put the icing on the cake, our history teacher appeared to watch part of our outing. he even offered to buy nicole some new icecream if she would get outta the garabage! well, that was friday. saturday was dandy, we went to hometown days. but thats about it. on sunday tara, haley, tati and i went to the ranch. at the ranch we did alot, including brushing and pampering stallion. so yea, that was my fun filled weekend. oh boy!!! now that my fingers are numb i better stop. well hope you can have as much fun as i do sometime!! p.s. i probobly spelt alot of things wrong so, yea.  this paragraph is dedicated to murphalicious, since she couldnt attend.

      ok, today i went to the ranch with ricky, bet u didnt know that. it was very boring, but at the same time great. first we did nothing. then we went to capture the new horses for riding. they were cute and dandy. after that robert told us to fill up the waters. we were like ok, so we went to fill up the many many stalls with water. the hoses are soooooooooooo slow that it took like ten mins. just to fill up one already half way filled barrel! we were going to the other side when ricky turned around and tripped over a water pipe. well........ it broke. water was flowing and nothing would stop it. i was thinking to my self, hey i could be like that polish kid w/ his finger in the wall, but im not polish and its just a pipe. well that didnt work, i just got really wet. poncho just turned off the water and fixed the pipe, i tortured ricky the rest of the day. :D. nothin happened the rest of the day except for interesting conversations. but then something beautiful happened.lol. ricky dropped a granola wrapper and it was flying away. he chased it across the ranch every where. it was hilarious!!! when he finally caught it he trew it away. he then sat down and we were talking. five to ten mins later the granola wrapper flew out of  the garabage and the look on ricky's face was sooooooooo priceless, as it was earlier when he got startled by a horse and when he broke the pipe. it was frickin great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i was such a happy camper. oh i forgot the bitch slappin winds. it was so windy that the winds created minny sand storms. well, when you would turn your head you would be bitch slapped by flying dirt. :D:D i got something in my eye and it was extreamly painfull. merrrr. then robert decided to give me some wierd ass dominatrix bracelets (mine and ricky's minds were in da gutter and thats how the appeared to us), which were just from the new saddles. but they were like bracelets. but yea. thats bout it. except they shaved winnie and he is pretty now. kinda. :D

      On saturday tati and i went to da beach. it was a super barrel of monkeys!first it was super foggy and cold, then we went into the ocean to boogie board. it was very fun. later there were seals in the water and they were making the typical seal noise, but stupid as people are everyone was like "dolphins dolphins!!!! omg dolphins, listen to the sounds they make!" they were dumb. then later more, tati and i decided, HEY! lets try and boogie board in a shallow flowing creek that goes into the ocean. so, we did. we ended up getting stuck to the ground and pushing ourselfs towards the ocean like fricken sea turtles. there were a few spots deep enough to let us flow a little, but thats were the children were, oooo the poor children. i "accedentially" ran over a few children, owell, my bad. im such a good person! ok, moving on. tati and i then decided to play in a tavernackle (what we call it, actually a very tiny cave thing) on the side of a cliff like thing. it was great, untill we jumped off landing on our faces in the sand. we then decided to frolic away and draw pictures in the sand. tati drew nice pictures and obsessive john pictures while i drew pictures of the grim reaper and other dandy things. hehehe. i later decided i wanted to build a house! tati didnt want to so i did it by myself. first i had to move a 100lb log. that was horrid. i ended up buildin a lever like thing w/ another stick to flip it, that didnt work, so i had to just roll/ semi- lift it. oh god that was horrible. but thats about all that happened that day. so yea. tata for now.

      Today in biology we had an earthquake drill. it was funny because our desks were stable and i thought of all the other ghetto desks that would break and the child would die. well moving on, ricky and i were having a dandy time under our desks when dominic starts freaking out.  dominic: OMG! theres an earth quake?!?!? OMG save me! i cant feel anything though. do you feel it? i cant feel it!!!! what is wrong?!? i cant feel it!!!!!  Ricky and I: dominic its ok, its just a drill. it twas beautiful, and so was saying twas. o and earlier dominic decided to say everything in rapper styleness. Ricky and i almost killed him. Bio is a great class. while my group and others were working on their posters my teacher and her "aid" tiffani told me i was skinny and to put billions of paper towels on top of the wall edge thingy (that contains dust lions that go ROOOAAAR). well, the majority of the period was me and tiffani making paper towel pyramids. it was fun. later that day ricky and john came to my house and ricky retrieved a memory card and john stayed to await for tati and coral. he had some "bizzyness" with tati. hehehe.........eww-e. anyways tati and i were hug wrestling, ie: killing with love, when we both slid onto our backs, it was funny. and at the moment there is a hidden foxtail of death in my sleeve that pokes my wrist every time i type. IM GOING INSANE!!! i must gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! *shudder shudder shudder*

      ok i know it is sad i posted 4 thingies in one sitting, BUT in english class yesturday we were watching the oddessy (htf do you spell that!?!?) and it was at the part when the mother lady was going to kill herself. she was walking towards the ocean when all of a sudden penelope jumps infront of here and shouts a prolonged NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! then it looks at the mother again and you can see the maid in the background having a siezure like thing. their efforts to stop her death dont work and then the mom walks into the ocean and well, dissapeares. yea i dono. well we thought it would be great if we did this in science class! the teacher would announce that we're having a test and i would jump up and flail around the teacher shouting a prolonged NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Then after that i would go sit back down and have a siezure like thing and suddenly something will dissapear! its a plan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Murphy's mom is a long story but to make it short, she spans from bushes at the mall. OK so today in history class murphy and i were looking for mr.cotter so she could turn in here death essay! but he was no where to be found. here is our conversation:  Murphy:  i wonder where mr.cotter is.  Me:  hey i do to, maybe he is hiding in a sinister corner behind the book cases like last time.  Murphy:  perhaps, lets ask the lady where he is.  Me:  the librarian? where mr.cotter is?  Mr.Cotter:  im here!  Murphy and I:  ahhh where is he?!  *looking around library frantically* Us: where?  Mr.Cotter: here!  Us:  ahhhhh its like your mom all over gain!
