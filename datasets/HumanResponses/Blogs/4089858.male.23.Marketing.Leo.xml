      What the heck is up, y'all? So, I obviously don't have anything to do and I was bangin' away on the keyboard and thought hmmmmmmmmmm? What if I type in  urlLink "Mr.Spud".com?  I wondered what would happen. Check it out. It's a christian site! who knew? I also typed in  urlLink "KidLysol".com  and got a photography site. Wierd stuff. And My Sister,  urlLink The Early Worm  , is a beautiful model......... What the heck is going on?  Well that was neither funny nor blogworthy, but it's something. I'm pretty pathetic! Peace, Love, and Hair Grease, Y'all!  ;-P Spud

      If all I talk about is guitars, I'll run out of things to talk about real quick! So, I decided today I would talk about the JOB SEARCH. I went on an interview today at Enterprise and it went well. All I have to do now is get them to call back! The truth of the matter is now that I just want a job! All anyone can tell me is Good Luck! .........if you say so!  Peace, Love, and Hair Grease, Y'all!  -Spud

      Well, I was sitting around scratching my nuts earlier and I thought, hmmmmm? What am I gonna post about. Although I really don't have anything planned out on this topic yet, I thought I could give it a try. Guitar players throughout the last 30 years or so have generally fallen into three categories: Overrated, Underrated, and Just Plain Awesome! I think you know what I mean, when I say this. Stevie Ray Vaughn for instance...... Give me a break, people were worshiping this idiot. He has no classical training and I think the only thing he has mastered is making people think he's really good. Some people may not agree with my next guinea pig, but I'll throw it out anyway. Ask any idiot on the street who the greatest guitar player of all time is and they'll say??????? Bingo! you guessed it: Jimi Hendrix. I beg to differ folks, the only reason people say that is because he died in his prime. That is the truth. If Jimmy Page died in the seventies, which sometimes I often wish he would have (I just saw him on a rerun of Saturday Night Live playing with Puffy Daddy), there would be friggin' statues of him in every city in the world with idiots like me bowing down to it. Now, all of this may seem like a matter of opinion to you, but has anyone ever heard of a guitarist named  urlLink Eric Johnson ? Check him out! You want to talk about underrated! Anyway, we'll continue this later. Peace, Love, and Hair Grease, Y'all -Spud

      Alright fellers,  If you have been reading, you know Aces went out and got XM Radio. He's been raving about it since his Cuz came down. It is pretty cool, but since I have no job, hence no mula, I have to find other ways to get good music. Well check this out. If you are always at the computer, which i am for a good part of my day, check  urlLink XMRadio.com  out and listen for free. Just pick out what you want to listen to from the menu on the left and you are singing Hall&amp;Oates, but I do have to say  urlLink Channel 31-The Torch  is some pretty good Christian Music. As always,  Peace, Love, and Hair Grease, Y'all!  -Spud

      Well, well, well, it looks like I finally gave in to nerddom and am blogging.  Although  urlLink Kid Lysol  started this mess,  urlLink Philaces  was the last straw. I would like to thank my brother-in-law for that! The thing will be keeping up with this stuff! There is a slight chance that I'll get aggravated and stop posting, but we'll see. Anywho..... I decided to name my blog after my new sandbox. That is my geetar room upstairs. When there is absolutely nothing to do (which is pretty much all the time!) I go up there and jam away. So my next post will be something about geetarin' or my past experiences with it. By the way, I may have to ask Kid how to work the hyperlinks, because I don't think i'm doing it right! Peace, Love, and Hair Grease, Y'all!

      Alright, I think I have this thing figured out.  Kid and Aces posted today about how music is just totally void of all creativity.  I would have to agree, so I think maybe we just need to look harder.  Although my tastes are a little more mainstream than Kid's I think I still have better taste!  Anyway, Creed was a big deal in the late 90's and I really didn't get into them until I started playing with Carpenter's Bride, but Tim introduced me to them and the amazing guitar work of Mark Tremonti.  I was thrilled when I learned that Creed broke up and Tremonti started  urlLink Alter Bridge .  You may not think they are the greatest, but I think the music is great and be sure to listen long enough to watch Tremonti "shredd lead guitar."  This guy kicks ass!
