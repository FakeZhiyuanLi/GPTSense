      Today is pretty uneventful.  Blah keeps bugging me to spend time with him, but I keep putting him off.  I'd pretty much rather saw my fingers off with a plastic spoon.  My friend DJ that lives in Boston sent me a present today, a freakin Louis Vuitton purse!  It was a belated birthday present, and he said since he has never given me a birthday present in the 7 years i've known him that he's going to make it all up with this one.  He's like "now you have to go to the club and drag it on the floor like you a millionaire."  I'm the lowest maintenance girl ever, so me getting a Louis is like a crackhead getting an 8ball.  It just doesn't happen.    Ok, does this seem ummm inappropriate to you?  my girl has this boyfriend who we'll call... GQ (cuz he thinks he is).  Well, they've been together like 7-8 years, living together & everything.  Well like 5 years ago he cheated on her, they worked through it blah blah blah.  On New Years Eve, the 3 of us, and GQ's nephew who's our age went out to a strip club.  Well, I started drinking long before anyone else so I was pretty tipsy.  I kiss a couple strippers, get a couple dances, whatever... it was a fun night.  Then we drop my girl off at home because she was havin no part of it, and we go to this party.  Well, at the party I go to the bathroom and i'm fixin my make up with GQ walks in and shuts the door behind him.  He's like tryin to make small talk and I'm thinkin, WTF are you doin in here?  Then he goes in to kiss me.  He was the DD, so he wasn't drunk.  Of course i'm like ummm NO!  So, then he tells all these people that werent there about how i kissed strippers and got dances and shit.  Like they need to know my shit!  So now, he's been calling and e-mailing me a lot more than usual.  Today he's saying how we need to go out drinking when I'm back in town.  He makes it very clear that he wants it to just be him and I.  I thought that was kind of weird.  I was like fuck that!  why?  so you could tell eeeeeeverybody what happens, and i can hear about it for the next year?  I'm cool.  He was like "hey, blame your girl for that.  I just told her.  she told EEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVEERYBODY else.  I thought I could trust her.  guess I was wrong.  so that means it'll have to be just you and me when you come out to visit."  I told him we can all go out, and i'll drink but i'm not getting DRUNK.  he goes "it's cool, it can just be you and me,  ain't nobody gotta find out about what happens.  I'll keep it a secret.  and I'm gonna get you fu-FUCKED up!!!"  OK... is it just me, or is something really wrong with this picture???  Anyway, tonight I think I'm going to have a Netflix night with my cuddle bitch, which really is a term of endearment ;)  Tomorrow I'll go to a club, and Sunday I'll repent for all my sins, or just sleep... whatever works. =)  With all this frustration built up, I need to get laid!  Well, have a good weekend.  Drink, party, dance, screw... do what you do.  adios.

      It's Friday.  Finally.  I don't know why, but last night everything just hit me as really fuckin irritating.  I mean, like, I was even thinking about shit that already happened and was getting irritated about it all over again.  Cop's wife came over with the babies, and I think that's what started it.  Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE those little ones to death.  They are so precious, and I love being around them.  But last night I was already irritated when she came over, (Cop had left to do some errands) and she just fuckin lets herself in with the key he gave her.  I was like ummmm hi.  Like bitch, YOU DONT LIVE HERE!  FUCKIN KNOCK!  So she comes in with the 2 crying babies (one is 3 y/o, and the other is 2 months) and just plops all her shit in the living room (that I just cleaned).  Then, her phone rings so she leaves the 2 crying kids in the living room and goes in Cop's room to fuckin gossip with her one of her girlfriends.  So i go pick up the baby, and try to get him to stop crying and I was rubbing the other ones back.  So after like 15 minutes she comes in and is like "oh, you don't have to do that."  Ok, why dont i just be like you and leave 2 FUCKIN CRYING KIDS ALONE???  AAAAAAHHHHHHH!  So i went to my room to be alone with my irritated self, and she knocks on my door "are you ok??"  no bitch, i'm not ok.  LEAVE ME ALONE!  You're probably thinking, damn, what a bitch!  I'm really not, this is very rare for me but my anxiety level went up so high knowing she was coming, then her entrance just sent me through the roof.  After a while, Cop came home and he calls me out for dinner, so we're eating (the kids are sleeping), and every time Cop is talking directly to me about something, she interrupts and makes him talk to her.  So i'm basically just trying to take deep breaths and stay calm.  After dinner, Cop is cleaning up the dishes and her and I are sitting at the table and he whispers in my ear for me to get this R&B mix CD ( urlLink great sex music ) that he can put on while she takes a bubble bath that he's going to run for her (I gave him the idea because he wanted to do something nice for her).  So when he whispers that to me, you should've seen her face.  She looked like he grabbed me and starting fucking me on the table.  She was like "Okaaaaaaay!  What the fuck was that about???"  So I get up to get the cd, put it in his bathroom and go back to my room away from the fuckin antichrist.  About an hour later he comes in, and gives me a high 5 for the bath idea, I said "Who's your bitch?"  he said "You are!" and we both go to bed.    Ok, here's what I was thinking about last night that is still irritating me.  I explained Marine in my first post.  Well, we were together for a month, and it was fuckin amazing.  He lives 8 hours away, so it was all over the phone, and we had planned a weekend for him to come up and spend with me.  Over the phone we talked about everything!  He told me I was the one, we talked about marriage, kids, he asked me my ring size, everything... lots of phone sex too ;)  He even sent me a letter, with pictures, and his dog tag that he wore in the middle east!  Which was a very big deal.  So the weekend comes, he gets here on a Friday night and we agreed (I'm not sure why) to not have sex on the first night he was here.  So we kissed a lot, did some fondling, but then decided sleep was probably a good idea.  In the morning we wake up start kissing, more touching, have oral sex, then we get up to have breakfast.  We had a great day together, it was so much fun!  Then Saturday night comes around and Cop and his wife ask us to bbq and drink with them.  We didn't know how to say no, so we agree.  We start drinking a little too early, so we were buzzed before we ate.  After we ate we started playing quarters.  Well, little did I know, Cop thought it would be really funny to get me reeeeeeeeeeally drunk.  I usually have a really high tolerance, but that night was different.  The last shot I remember taking was my third, and I was told I took 11.  So, after a while, I'm clearly on auto pilot and Cop pulls out the video camera and starts asking me if I would kiss his wife.  Now, I've kissed a few girls before, no big deal.  I'm straight as an arrow and very secure with my sexuality, so who cares.  To me, kissing a girl is NO BIG DEAL.  So, (keep in mind i don't remember any of this, I was told everything the next day) I said yeah, i'd kiss her.  Then, still being video taped, he's telling me to hit on her, and asking me how and where i'd kiss her.  Well, she's getting all embarrassed, and Marine is getting pissed, I don't know what the fuck is going on, and obviously Cop is the only one who thinks it's funny.  So, nothing ever happened with it, no kiss, nothing.  It was all talk.  Later, Marine asks Cop's wife why nobody told him I'm a lesbian.  HAHAHA!!!  She was like um because she's not!  She's drunk, go talk to her.  Well, hello!  I'm in no condition to talk, I think that's pretty clear by now.  He comes in and tries to have a serious talk with me anyway.  So, needless to say, I really don't remember what was said.  I do remember talking about what happened between Cop and I in high school (probably not a good subject to talk about with Marine), and I remember him saying he should probably leave, and me crying.  Other than that... i draw a total blank.  So the next morning I wake up at like 8:00 like heyyyyy WTF???  Why isn't he here???  So I try to call him, no answer.  I lay there for a while, then try again at 8:30, nothing.  So I go wake up Cop and I was like dude... he fuckin left!  He's like WHAAAAAAAAT???  I was like yeah, WTF HAPPENED LAST NIGHT???  So, he tells me the story and I'm so fuckin embarrassed.  Like, OMG, I can't believe I did that.  So Cop was like, "well it's my fault, you were getting drunk really fast and I thought it was funny, so I just kept making you take more and more shots."  I was too upset about Marine leaving to be mad at Cop yet.  So during that day I tried calling him numerous times and he wouldn't take my calls, I tried text messaging him, nothing.  I figured he went to his parents house that live 2 hours away.  So on top of my hangover, the fact that I'm not exactly clear on what happened, he left in the middle of the night after driving almost 10 hours to get here, and now he's ignoring me.  i was a freakin WRECK!  Not like a fender bender, but like a fuckin 50 car pile up.  My heart was broken beyond belief.  So Monday rolls around I get up, dont take a shower, no make up, didnt give a fuck... get to work and what's the first thing my boss asks???  How was your weekend with Marine?  I just burst into tears, and she's like omg, honey, go home and get some rest.  So I come home and try to call him again, and again, and again.  Cop's wife is there so I apologize to her for what happened, and for making her uncomfortable.  She said it was totally fine, that she was mad at Cop for making me take all those shots when everyone knew I shouldn't have.  So she tries calling and text messaging Marine for me, and he wont take hers either.  So then at like 3pm he sends me a text message that says "hey.  you need to relax.  you didn't do anything wrong.  it's me, being with you just didn't feel right.  i'll call you in a couple days."  *poof* all my feelings of sadness, guilt, regret all turned to anger.  I need to relax?!?!?  What the fuck did you just say?  Fuck you!  You leave in the middle of the night, I have no idea what happened, then ignore me for 2 days and I need to relax?  OH HELL NO!  So I didn't reply, didnt call, nothing.  I was just basically like fuck him.  So the week passes and on Thursday night at like 11 he text messages me saying he can't talk, but he can text message.  He said sorry for hurting me, that wasn't his intention, but that he just didn't feel the way he thought he would when he was with me and didn't know what to do.  I told him he could've fuckin sat me down and talked me to me about it when we were sober.  He said he was afraid of hurting me.  I was like oh ok, so you leave in the middle of the night, when we're both drunk so I don't even know what happened, and then ignore me for 2 days, THAT wouldn't hurt me.  You fuck!  He asked if we could be friends and I was like yeah, sure.  So the next day, I packed up all the shit he gave me and sent it to him, dog tag and all.  I wrote a very nice note saying i was very honored to have these things, but didn't feel right keeping them because they are things he should have to give to a future girlfriend.  And that was that, haven't heard from him since.  This all happened 3 weeks ago, and I'm still irritated about it.  I'm so over him, because that was such a bitch thing to do.  He didn't have the fuckin balls to talk to me about what he was feeling, then leaves when i'm so drunk i don't know my own name, sends me a text message 2 days later, then another text message like 3 days after that.  Sorry, but I need a man that has some fuckin balls and doesn't fuckin run and hide like a little bitch.  Wow, surprisingly, I feel better after letting all that out. *sigh of relief*  Ok... time to get some work done.  Just a quick request to gum chewers out there... CHEW WITH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH CLOSED!  Jesus!  That's so fuckin obnoxious!

      It's Thursday morning, wish it was Friday.  Actually no, I wish it was Saturday, because then I would be at home in bed.  Chester has already e-mailed me 4 times this morning and it's only 8:50!  He needs to fuckin call his wife, Jesus.  Cop said I need to take him up on his Vegas offer then tell him I'm on the rag when we're there, I was like yeah... so he can just ask for head?  He's like "just tell him you have oral herpes!"  haha!  Now that's funny!  Cop's wife is coming today to stay for the weekend... if only you could see the excitement on my face. :|  Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.  So, totally off the subject of what I normally talk about, I just ran across this guy's blog and it's fuckin awesome.  He has some great stories , check it out:  urlLink TJ's Place .  Now this guy is pure comedy, you gotta check this out:  urlLink beer and rap .  Well, today was really fuckin lame.  I should be getting some Netflix movies in today, so, um... yeah, that's exciting. Hasta luego.

      Chester started e-mailing me first thing this morning, telling me I need to go back home for a visit so he can convince me to stay and we can be together.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.  I told him that Mama's Boy always suspected that I cheated on him with Chester and he said I should've when I had the chance, it would've given him a reason to make the accusations.  Sorry jackass, I don't cheat!  He also said he wants to take me to Vegas, he'll pay for everything.  I still think he's married.  I sent a care package to Army today in Iraq.  I talked to him the other day and he seemed really down.  Hopefully this package will cheer him up a little.  Everyone told me to send him a Playboy, but you can't send porn into a muslim country.  Damn!    Cop's wife is getting on my last nerve.  I swear she has multiple personalities.  She's so fuckin 2 faced!  She's so sweet to me like everything's fine, but then when I turn around and she's all pissed telling him stupid shit like he's not allowed to hug me.  Last night him and I were eating dinner and he tells me not to tell her we ate dinner together because she'll get mad.  WTF???  She spends like 3-4 nights a week at our apartment, and it's a little too much for me.  When she's there, him and I basically have to argue the entire time so she won't think we get along too well, or that we're too close.  I don't want to be with him, but I want my best friend back.  Needless to say, the few nights a week she's not there are great.  Ok, time to get some work done...

      I'm just basically going to stick to my love/sex life here, going into anything else would drive you crazy!  I'm convinced that my 20's are the most confusing and difficult years of my life.  I'm 24, and single.  Starting to think about settling down... but can't seem to find anyone I'd want to settle down with.  I'll give you a key to start off with:   Cop  - my best friend for 8 years, met and started having sex with him in high school.  very hot!  he's married now with 2 little ones, but lives with me.  he and his wife are separated, but trying to work things out.  Last time we had sex was about 4 months ago.  more painful than satisfying, "it's" a little too big for me.  he's about to be a cop though, and as you'll see i'm a HUGE sucker for uniform.   Marine  - we were friends in HS, lost touch for 7 years, I found him (he's a marine now) and we became a couple within a few days.  The first weekend he came to see me that all fell apart, and we haven't spoken since.  we had oral sex, but not the real thing.  we were together a month.  i knew it was too good to be true.   Borracho  (means drunk in spanish) - no good, was with him for 8 months when I was 18-19 and he still always seems to track me down.  Sex was great, if you don't mind a crazy, violent, coke snorting, alcoholic.   Chester (the molester)  - dated him... correction had sex with him for several months when i was 19-20, he was 29-30.  again, the sex was great but i wanted more than just sex and he was quite content with it, until i found someone new, then he decides he wants to be together.  i'm convince he's married, but can't prove it.  we still e-mail all the time, and he still insists that he's in love with me and wants to settle down.   Mama's boy  - left Chester for this one.  was with him for 2 years, loved him to death but he was the biggest ASS ever!  such a cocky, self absorbed, jerk!  great sex, but lousy boyfriend.  And the biggest mama's boy known to man!  we still talk occasionally too... he swears he's changed and i'm the only one for him, blah blah blah...   Army  - met this guy online like 7 years ago and became very close, we've talked on the phone, but never met in person.  He's in the army now and in Iraq. =(  He's 23, and I love him to death.  So genuine, and sweet.  We say that we're soulmates, and a lot of the time I actually believe we are.   Blah  - boring boring boring!  met him when i first moved here, pretty good looking, but he has NO personality.  can't take a joke, just really bland, and annoying.  we went out a few times, kissed... and that's about the extent of it.  he still bugs me to spend time with him but i have other really important things to do like spot clean the carpet under my furniture.   Cuddle bitch  - very very nice guy, met him when i first moved here as well.  not the best looking guy in the world but his lips, and fingers are amazing!  i often refer to him as my "cuddle bitch" because we've never had sex, and i'm not really interested in sex with him.  although last time he was over i felt his package and it was quite adequate.   Fireman  - a fireman and HOT HOT HOT as fiuh! one of my older sister's best friends.  he's 33, and we've had sex a few times.  he has a girlfriend now, so I wish him the best.     FBI  - this guy is amazing, 33 and an FBI agent.  talk about hot!  another one of my older sister's best friends.  I've known him since I was born, and he was like 10 years old.  we had sex for the first time on my 23rd b'day, and several times in the past year.  if i'm being honest... the sex is probably about a 2 out of 10, but he gets an E for effort.  He's great looking, and has the FBI thing going for him so that makes up for it.  ahhh power is such a freakin turn on!    These are the guys that I currently talk to, and will be referring to the most in my blogs.  I've slept with roughly 20 guys, give or take a few, starting when i was 14, is that bad???  These are the ones that are still around.    Ok, that should be enough to start off... time to close up at work so I can get home and make dinner for Cop.

      Buenos dias!  I have no idea why I'm in such a good mood today, but I am.  Maybe it's all the  urlLink soldiers from Reagan's funeral .  I watched them throughout the evening last night.  The 5 of them (one for each branch of the military) just stood perfectly still, in full dress uniform, guarding Reagan's casket in half hour shifts.  So, you guessed it, every half hour there was the whole "changing of the guards" process.  I watched it about 12 times yesterday, and let me tell you... it never got old.  THEN... damn C-SPAN cut out just before another changing of the guards for some republican conference for people who worked with Reagan to talk about him.  That's all well and good, but I missed 3 changing of the guards because of it.  They could of at least done the picture within a picture thing where they had the soldiers in a small screen up at the top.  But nooooooooo.  Now, just so you don't think I'm a complete freak for watching these soldiers stand there for hours on end, I should let you know that (for the most part) I just tuned in at the :29, and :59 of every hour.  Just in time to see them salute, raise their rifles, and march in and out.  Needless to say I set my VCR to record all of today's events ;)  Yes, I know I'm going to hell for getting such enjoyment out of the events surrounding the loss of someone's life.  But you know what?  I'm ok with going to hell.  Everyone I know is gonna be there, why would I want to be anywhere else?    So, Cop talked to me a little last night, nothing big or important but I'll take what I can get.  This morning I wished him well on his interview with LAPD tomorrow, and told him to drive safe, then he gave me a hug, but shhhhhhh don't tell his wife! (rolling my eyes).  Speak of the antichrist, she called me last night (from Cop's mom's house) and was like "ummm are you mad at me?"  I said "I have a lot on my mind, and really don't want to talk about any of it."  She was like "I just feel really bad because we're good friends, and I want you to talk to me about whatever is going on with you."  Oh for fuck's sake!  Shut up you fuckin 2 faced beezy! (the word Cop and I use for bitch)  I just said "I'm fine."  Fuck her, I don't trust her for shit so I'm not telling her shit.  Confronting her would do nothing but make the situation worse, because she would just turn around and twist my words up and make me out to be the bad guy.    I had lunch again today with Benz.  He told his boyfriend about Cop and I having sex for the last time like 4-5 months ago, and his boyfriend told him to ask me if it's true what they say about black guys (Cop is half black, half italian).  I told him yes, that it was more painful than anything else.  Then we both started cracking up.  I love hanging out with Benz, he loves to do all the stuff you do with girl-friends, but has the chill personality of a guy.    My weekend plans are still under debate.  I have the apartment to myself, so there's several options there.  But to tell you the truth, I don't really want to see anyone.  I think I just kind of want to have a quiet weekend to myself.  Sleep in, wash my car, watch movies... stuff like that.  I don't know what turning 24 did to me, but I've been so much more mellow lately.  19-23 were craaaaaaaaaaaaaazy, and now I'm starting to think I'm ready to think about settling down.  What the...???

      Wow, was I in a foul mood yesterday.  Sorry about that.  It really didn't get much better throughout the night, but I'm much better today.  Mama's boy called and we got in a huge arguement because of his lying, once again.  He IM's me saying that he was mad at me (ask me if I give a fuck if he's mad at me!), I was like "oh, that's nice."  Blah blah blah... long story short, he said he was in Phoenix last week, which (according to him) was the weekend he was supposed to come see me.  I think he was just saying this to try to make me feel bad, because it was all a lie.  He never once mentioned coming to see me.  However, it didn't work because I don't want him to come out here.  He was saying how hurt he was that I blew him off when I went back home to visit, and how he needs to quit getting his hopes up, and not wear his heart on his sleeve.  Normally I would've pissed my pants because I would've been laughing so hard, but yesterday I was in a very bad mood and he just set me off with his lying, and guilt trip bullshit.  So then, when I get out of work he calls me (why did I pick up?) and starts with the lying, and guilt trips again.  We got in a screaming match and I get home, still on the phone screaming at eachother, and Cop, his wife, and the little ones are all there.  So i go in my room, shut the door and fight with him until I realize I'm wasting my time talking to him at all and hang up.  Then Cop knocks on my door and asks if I'm ok.  I say yeah.  Then he goes "here, give him a kiss, it always makes me feel better."  And he holds the baby up for me to kiss.  Then they leave to his mom's house like a happy little family.  I watched the Reagan funeral most of the evening (I know I'm going to hell for this, but watching all those men in uniform was better than porn!)  They get home at like 10 and I play with the 3 year old for a little bit, then he goes to bed and Cop's wife comes to sit and watch TV with me.  I turn the TV up to keep the talking to a minimum, she got bored I think and went to bed too.  That was my evening.  Cop and his wife are driving to LA this weekend because he has an interview with LAPD.  I get the apartment to myself, yayyyyyyyy! =)

      Ok, so I go to lunch with Benz. and we're sitting there eating, talking, laughing... when this guy (who was pretty hot, I must say) comes up and says "excuse me, I'm sorry but I've been watching you from across the room and would like to ask if you would be willing to come and finish your lunch with me at my table, I would pick up the tab for both of you."  I looked at Benz, then at the guy, and asked "Just me, or him too?"  He said "Oh no, just you."  Benz was like, "And you'll pay for my lunch too??? Take her!"  I kicked him under the table, and he was like "I mean, hell no.  She's with me!" as he's rubbing his leg.  I told the guy "Thanks but no thanks.  I came to lunch with him and that's who I'm going to stay with."  So he leaves, and Benz was like "Hey, you just fucked up a free lunch for us!"  I told him I'm not a lunch whore.  So all afternoon he's been like, "Hey, feel like turning a trick tomorrow?"  Fucker!  That guy was a little too much for me, with the whole suit, and tie and attitude like Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal.  Pllllllllllllease.  Cop and I still aren't really talking, 2 or 3 words here and there.  Last night he didn't come home until close to 11pm, then went straight to his room to play XBOX and talk to his wife on the phone.  I'm just letting him do his thing, but it doesn't mean it doesn't bother me.  So today his fuckin wife IM's me acting all sweet and shit, when i KNOW she's to blame for this problem.  So I'm pretty cold with her.  I'm civil, but I wouldn't really call it friendly.  She keeps asking what's wrong and I keep telling her I dont want to talk about it.  So then she's like "well, I was going to come over tonight, but if you need space let me know and I won't come."  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight, so you can tell Cop that I told you not to come?  Cause that won't make matters worse!  I told her to do what she wants and left it at that.

      So, last night sucked.  Cop's wife went back home, and so I was excited to be able to kick it with him and enjoy our normal friendship, but he was on the phone with her the entire night.  He just acts really different now.  Like... well, i'll be blunt... he's fuckin WHIPPED!  She has his ass in check like no other.  He used to give me a big hug goodbye every morning before I left to work, so this morning (thinking I'm going to get that big hug) I go in his room to say bye and he gives me one of those half ass, one arm hugs.  Ever since she told him he's not allowed to hug me he has this guilt cloud hanging over his head.  Whatever, I guess I just have to accept that this is the way things are now.    One thing happened that made my night 110% better though.  I got a post card from Army.  This is the first thing I've gotten from him since he's been in Iraq.  It was just a "hi, i'm thinking of you" card, but it meant the world to me.  =)  Hopefully he gets the box I sent him soon.  It should be about another week I think.    I just got back from lunch and I'm in the worst fuckin mood.  I was sitting on the couch getting my mid-day dose of "COPS" when Cop walked in.  He didn't say a word to me just walked straight to the kitchen, I was like oooook fine.  So I stayed watching Cops till it ended and it was time for me to head back to work.  The only thing that we said to eachother the entire time was, he asked me "is that you making that noise?"  I said "no".  Then when i left i said "later" and he said bye.  What the fuck happened???  Before this fuckin bitch came back into his life we were fine.  We talked and laughed all the time, everything was great.  We would hang out, watch movies, go out to eat... we were BEST FRIENDS.  Now that this fuckin whore is back, she pulls his strings like a god damn puppet and I lose my best friend.  Whatever.  Fuck him if he's going to turn into a little bitch.  The funny thing is he always does this.  This time feels worse I guess because we live together now, but every time they break up or get in a fight he comes straight to me to vent, talk about it, get advice, whatever he needs.  And i'm always fuckin there to listen and help in any way I can.  That's why he lives with me!  They were living together at her parent's house and he left her and showed up on my doorstep.  I took him in and supported him 100% both financially and emotionally.  I never asked him for a fuckin dime for 2 months.  Then we sign a lease, they get back together and now it's like I don't exist.  I'm so fuckin tired of it.  The other day he told me "I really want it to work out between us this time, but if it doesn't I'm just going to come to you again so you can pick up all the pieces like you always do."  Well, you know what?  Fuck that.  I'm not going to be his fuckin best friend of convenience anymore.  I'm just going to not give a fuck.  I think I've officially reached my breaking point with him.  On top of all of this, he always claims to be broke.  The only thing he pays is rent.  And I have to nag the shit out of him to make him get it in on the last day possible before it's late.  I asked him for his half of the cable bill like 3 times, nothing.  So I paid it.  Gas and electricity?  That would be me.  His cell phone?  Shut off.  I even give him gas money when he asks for it.  All the cleaning in the apartment?  I do it.  Cooking?  Me.  Maintenance calls, and follow ups?  Yup, me.  I want to know how the fuck he is so broke.  I pay rent, cable, cell phone, utilities, a car payment, insurance, gas, my gym fee, Netflix... and still have money left over.  He wants everyone to feel sorry for him because he pays a car payment, rent, and child support.  Sorry, but don't hold your breath for my sympathy.  If you're so broke, get a 2nd job and quit playing fuckin XBOX.  It's time for him to grow up and be a man.  He has a wife, and 2 kids and is being supported by 2 women, actually 3 because his mom still contributes to his sympathy fund too.  I'm tired of feeling awkward in my own house because his fuckin wife is there and I have to walk on eggshells around her.   Ok, I'm going to shut up now.

      Monday ughhhhhhhhhhhhh  As if dragging my ass out of bed wasn't bad enough, I have to come to work only to have an e-mail arguement with a friend about why I don't want to go to her wedding and spend an entire evening stuck in the same room with Marine, and alcohol.  We have a mutual friend who is getting married in July, well, she sends me an invitation AFTER Marine and I broke up.  She knows the details of the break up, and sees no reason for me to not want to go.  I was saying how awkward and uncomfortable it would be and she said " It would be nice to have you there. Having you there would make a difference to me. So don't think that it won't! You missed my shower for him, and now you are going to miss my wedding, the most important day to me???  I am not saying this to make you feel guilty, but maybe it's time you moved on, and deal with it."    I'm not the one that can't move on and deal with it!  He is!  He's the one who asked if we could be friends, and now he's acting like a little fuckin girl and won't talk to me.  At first he would text message me (like we're in high school), now he won't talk at all.  And I'm supposed to jump at the chance to go to a wedding where I won't know ANYONE but the bride, groom, and Marine?  Riiiiiiiiiiiiight!  She keeps telling me to bring a date, duh, of course I would.  But that's not the point!  So now I'll feel guilty if I don't go, but going will make me feel about as comfortable as Michael Jacko's dangling baby.  What to do, what to do???  Anyway... my weekend was ok.  Did everything I said I was going to do, but no real cool stories unfortunately.  Oh wait, i fainted yesterday because i didn't drink water and went to the gym so I got hella dehydrated.  I smacked my head so then my head hurt, nevermind, that wasn't cool, that sucked.  Today is going alright, I can't believe it's already 2:00!  I went to lunch today with my friend Benz, he's this gay guy I work with.  He's great!  We talk about everything which is cool because he understands both sides of the situation with all my guy problems.  Ok well, this is boring so i'm gonna get back to work...

      Ok, so, everything is so much better now.  I bluffed big time today to Cop, and told him I was moving to the bay area so that his wife can move in and I won't be in their way.  He sat me down and we had a really long talk about everything and we got everything out in the open, and then he was telling me how much he loves me and started crying.  I was like what the...???  I've never seen him cry in the 8 years I've known him, not once.  So he made me promise not to leave and told me that he is going to work on changing some things.  I feel so much better knowing I have my best friend back.  =)

      Monday is almost over... yayyyyyyyyy!!!  It was a pretty uneventful weekend.  Watched movies, hung out with Benz a little, cleaned my apartment.  That's about it.  I totally needed a weekend of peace and quiet to myself.  It was so nice just being mellow for once.  Today at lunch I went home, and Cop was there.  We're eating when all of a sudden someone starts banging on the front door, so i'm like who the fuck is knocking like the god damn PO-lice?  I open the door, and WTF?? it IS the police!  I was like.. ummm yeah??? They said they got a couple calls saying people could hear a domestic dispute and possibly violence going on in our apartment.  I was like huh??? Then Cop walks in (a bald black guy in a wife beater) and was like what's going on???  One of the cops was like "sir, let the lady talk!"  For some sick reason, I thought this was helarious!  So i put my head down mostly because I was trying not to laugh, and they thought I was trying not to cry.  The lady cop was just dying to cuff him, she kept giving him the dirtiest looks.  So they were like, ma'am... you need to tell us what happened.  Did he hit you???  Cop was looking at me like "you bitch!"  Then I busted out laughing and the 2 cops looked at me like what the hell?  I told them no, nothing was wrong, we were just home for lunch and there was so problem they must have the wrong apartment.  They kept asking if I was sure, then they left.  Cop was like "WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING??? TRYIN TO GET ME LOCKED UP???"  I was like "see...  fuck with me again!  Next time you WILL get locked up!"  It took him a little while, but then he started laughing about it too.  He is starting to come around a little *knock on wood*.  Yesterday he invited me to his mom's for dinner, and asked me if I wanted to go to the lake this weekend for some party, maybe he finally realizes what a punk he's been.  Who knows.

      So today my friend (the one that's a mutual friend of Marine) kept asking me if I'm going to her wedding, I finally told her yes, I would at least go to the ceremony.  Then she was asking if I was going to bring Cop (we all went to high school together), I told her no, that his wife would never allow it.  So she told me to find a date, because I was welcome to bring someone.  Then Blah starts IMing me asking when he's going to get to see me again.  I just ignored him, the thought of spending time with him makes me want to drink cyanide!  I can't stop thinking about Army.  I have to write him a letter tonight.  I care, and worry about him so much!  My old roommate is going to be in town this weekend and wanted to know if I want to go out, I kind of do... we always used to go to strip clubs, it would be fun to go again.  Well, I'm bored, I think I'm going to flirt with the new guy in the office.  hasta manana.

      Last night I went home and took a nap, I didn't wake up until about 8:00 when Cop got home from class.  I must've been in a really deep sleep because I was all confused and groggy when I woke up, not to mention in a bad mood!  He just kept staring me asking me what's wrong and telling me how bloodshot my eyes were.  I just kept thinking, what the fuck is he talking about?  I was getting really irritated.  So i sat up, and decided to recline my seat, when I did, the back of the couch hit the wall and make a loud noise, and for some reason that REALLY pissed me off.  So i got up and started cussing at the couch lol I tried to push it away from the wall but it was too heavy so I kicked it as hard as I could.  Cop was watching the whole couch rage incident from the kitchen and had this look on his face like I was posessed.  I'd like to think I was, because that whole thing was pretty retarded now that i look back at it, but I was pissed at the time.  Anyway, i laid back down on the couch and went back to sleep, once I woke up for the 2nd time I was fine and in a good mood.  I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the couch.

      Did you really think I was going to name my blog the most unlucky number of them all?  That's like asking for a bad day, no spank you!  So, I got a letter from Army last night! =) It was so weird, on my way home Benz called and asked if I wanted to go to dinner.  I said yeah, even though I was dead tired, because I love hanging out with him.  So I went home took a quick shower, then he picked me up and we went to T.G.I.Friday's.  Lots of fun as always, then he drops me off and I was thinking I had to check the mail.  Usually, I'll let it go for a day or two if I'm too tired and lazy to walk across the complex and get it, but yesterday something was telling me I had to check it.  I had a really strong feeling I would get a letter from Army, and sure enough!  I was so excited!  So i open it up right away and start reading it while I'm walking back, well it turns out that he sent that letter the same day that I sent his care package (another weird coincidence), so I still don't know if he got it yet.  Anyway, he talked all about the weather there, and he described the combat he's been in, just trying to give me an idea of what he's going through.  At the end of the letter he told me basically to seize the moment, and if there's something I want to go after it.  It's not really like him to talk like that, so it kind of had me thinking.  Little does he know that he's what I want!  I would love to be with him.  But it's kind of hard when he's all the way across the world.  So anyway, after I read the letter like 10 times I started watching the dvd I got from Netflix called " urlLink 21 days to Baghdad ", it is so good!  Then Cop's wife and the 2 little ones came over, so I scooped up the baby and held him for pretty much the rest of the night.  I love holding him, and talking to him.  He looks at me like he's following, and understanding every word I say.  Every once in a while he coos like he's talking back to me.  It's SO fun!  We can sit and do that for hours and he never cries.  Man, I can't wait to have little ones of my own... some day. ;)  Ok, it's probably time to get some work done... see ya.

      This weekend was so much fun, I went to San Diego with my brother and my dad.  We went to the beach, and to Tijuana.  It was great!  I didn't want to come home.  I need to live somewhere closer to water.  I've narrowed it down to either the Bay Area or San Diego.  Come November, I'm moving to one of the two.  Cop is really making an effort since we had that talk the other day.  He called me yesterday on my way home to see how my trip was, and then again today to see how my day is going.  I have to give him a lot of credit to try to make such a fucked up situation work.  I definitely feel for him.  So on Saturday I get a really weird message from Fireman.  He called when I was in San Diego, and said he was thinking about me and wanted to see how I was doing.  Things that make you go hmmmmmmmm... so, I call my sister to see what's going on with him, and sure enough, he broke up with his girlfriend.  I didn't tell her he called because she would just throw a fit.  She likes to think she knows what's best for everyone, and likes to try to indirectly control other people's love lives.  So I definitely didn't want to mention the call to her because I didn't want to hear anything she would have to say about it.  I'm debating whether I want to call him back or not, nothing can really come of it because we live 1300 miles apart, but it would be interesting to talk to him.    Mama's boy also called me last week to try to make me jealous.  He said that him and his off and on (19 year old) girlfriend are getting back together.  He said that she wants to adopt his 6 year old daughter, and be the female role model in her life.  I laughed so hard I almost choked when he told me that.  The whole thing is just rediculous, but the only person I sympathize with in the situation is his little girl.  Her mom has never been around, so her grandma (mama boy's mom) has been raising her, and now he wants this 19 year old girl to adopt her?  Ay ay ay!    Ok, I have an hour and a half left of work, then I can go home take a shower get in my PJ's and watch my Netflix movies until I fall asleep.  Oh yeah, and hold Cop's little baby...=) I missed those little ones so much this weekend!  I don't know what I'm going to do when we move in November and I don't have them around anymore. =(

      Ok, so there's this freakin HOT guy that works in my building, and I mean H-O-T!  So hot that every time I pass him in the halls I blush!  I seriously can't even make eye contact with him.  So every once in a while we say hi when we run into eachother.  Well, when I was with Marine... I was in my relationship mode, so the work hottie didn't have any effect on me because I was all about Marine.  I think that intrigued him a little bit, that he wasn't getting the same blushing reaction he always got out of me, so he started talking to me more often.  Instead of just saying hi, he would make a lot of small talk.  Well, I haven't seen him around in a while and obviously Marine and I broke up a while back, so I've been dreading seeing the work hottie because I know I'll just act like a little school girl again.  So, today I was walking to the bathroom when he comes out of his office, I'm trying to duck away as the blood rushes to my cheeks and he goes out of his way to say hi.  I say hi and keep walking, then he tells me to wait up.  I'm blushing like crazy, and then I start shaking!  I'm like WTF is wrong with me?  It's just a freakin guy!  He's asking about my job, and what I do and asks if I'm interested in looking at other job opportunities, that he'd like to talk to me about working with him, and he asks for my number.  I said sure, and told him to stop by my office later and i'll give him my number.  So he came by, and the receptionist told him I was on the phone, and didn't bother to tell me he came by.  Grrrr!!!  So... we'll see if he tries again.

      So last night after work I went to Target to pick up a "few things", which any woman will tell you is impossible to do at Target.  I went to buy lipstick and mascara, and came out with $110 worth of crap.  Dammit!  Oh, but it was fun!  I bought my first George Foreman grill, so then I had to go home and use it, duh!  I made a steak that was pretty good, I'll have that grill mastered in no time!  I also bought Barbershop 2 and watched that last night, it was pretty funny.  THEN... it was time to get serious, last night was the season finale of the Real World San Diego.  Robin got off with a fine for punching that marine, Cameron got busted with a fake ID AGAIN and Brad got arrested AGAIN for snatching the fake ID out of the bouncers hand.  It was a good finale, I cried like a baby of course, just like I have for every finale in the past 10 years.  I finally got in bed around 1am, and for some reason decided to turn on the TV to see what was on, even though I was exhausted.  So I came across this movie that was just starting called  urlLink Soldier's Girl , it was so sad!  I stayed up until 3am watching it.  So, yes, I'm very tired.  Ok, back to work...

      Today fuckin sucks so far, I have cramps from hell and no advil.  Damn the man!  Last night I got home from work, made dinner (bbq pork chops, mashed potatoes, and peas.  By the way... when did i turn into my mother???), Cop's mom came over for a little bit, then Cop and his wife went to counseling and I babysat.  It was so much fun!  I took them both outside with a little foam bat and ball, and a water gun, I sat the baby in his little bouncy chair and I played with the 3 year old in the grass for like 2 hours.  I finally got him to start speaking spanish to me, which is big!  He's fluent in spanish and english, but won't usually speak spanish when he's at our house.  Last night he would talk to me in english and I would reply in spanish until he finally started speaking it too.  That was about it, then I watched Patch Adams and went to bed.  So, about the rest of the weekend... on Sunday I was sitting watching TV when Cop's wife comes in and asked me if Cop had talked to me about her and the boys moving in with us.  I was like, ummmmm NO!  WTF???  She got really pissed at him, and said that he told her to go get all her stuff from her mom's house and bring it to our apt. because he wants her to move in.  She asked him if he had talked to me about it and he said yes, that I was fine with it.  I was SO fuckin pissed when she told me that!  I told her that I don't think she should move in, that the situation is difficult enough with her being her 4-5 days a week much less living there.  So no, I don't want her to move in.  All they do is argue and fight, she's way too jealous of me and anyone else he gives any kind of attention too, it would cause way too many financial problems, and the 2 bedroom apartment is just way too small for 5 people, including two little ones, to permanently live there.  They only have 4 more months until the lease is up, then they can do whatever they want.  So she of course wanted to confront him about his lies, and asked me if I cared if she told him what I said.  Hell no I don't care, I want him to get busted.  So she goes in his room and was like "Why the fuck did you lie to me about talking to Elizabeth about us moving in?"  He denied it until he knew he was busted, then he said it must've been a misunderstanding on my part, then he admitted that he knew I wouldn't want them to move in, but if they did it anyway I couldn't say anything, and would just have to get over it.  She was like "ummm no!  It's her place too you fuckin asshole!  You can't do shit like that without discussing it with her first."  He's like "well it doesn't matter anymore, since you opened your big mouth and told her now you really can't move in."  Oh my god, I can't tell you how pissed I was when I found all of this out.  I've done everything for this fuckin asshole, I've bent over backwards to help him out.  I gave him a place to stay, (I supported him for 2 months), food, money, advice, you name it... I've done it for him.  And this is what he turns around and does???  My supposed best friend of 8 years???  Now you see why I don't fuckin trust anyone?  Everyone I've ever trusted has screwed me in one way or another.  Ok, I realize I might be over reacting, but it just really sucks when you do so much for someone and they turn around and try to screw you.    So THEN... Mama's boy calls me on Sunday and we talked for like an hour about anything and everything, he made sure to tell me like 3-4 times that he's not with the girl he was dating anymore.  Why did he tell me this so many times?  I have no idea.  It was a good conversation though, we didn't fight once.  Very odd, I know.  Well, that's it for now.  I think I've reached my bitching limit for the day.  See ya!

      What a confusing weekend!  Where do I begin?  Friday  night my old roommate came to visit and we were originally supposed to go out, until Cop's wife asked us if we would just stay home and drink so she could drink with us.  So, I felt bad (don't ask me why) and we just stayed home and started drinking.  Her and I had each taken about 5 really big shots, and my old roommate had taken 2 when we decided we wanted to go out.  So we left Cop with the 2 little ones and had a girls' night out.  Cop's wife got so freakin shitfaced that I spent most of the night babysitting her at the club.  After that we went home and she stumbled into bed with Cop, he came out and got pissed at me for letting her get so drunk.  It was pretty funny.    On Saturday I didn't really do much but watch movies and take a nap.  Then on Saturday night my phone was in my purse in the other room, so I couldn't hear it when it rang.  When I was going to bed I went to charge it, and i had 2 missed calls, and a voicemail from a number I didn't know.  I checked the voicemail and it was Marine!  He goes "Hey Elizabeth, it's "Marine".  I was just calling to say hi, and see how you're doing, and see what you're up to.  Give me a call at ... I was just calling to say what's up and see how you're doing, ok... uh... call me back.  Bye."  Awwww, wasn't that sweet that he called???  No!  Fuck that!  How many times did I try to call him after that horrible weekend, and he wouldn't take my calls or call me back.  Then he text messages me like a week later saying "It's not you it's me.  Let's be friends."  Fuck you.  I got no explanation for why he left, or why he ignored me, nothing.  Then a month later he decides he's ready to talk and I'm supposed to jump at the opportunity?  Ummm no.  He can kiss my ass.  I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him call the shots.  Fuck that.  So, obviously, I was not going to call him back.  If he wanted to talk bad enough, he'd call again.  Well, guess he did, because he called me yesterday afternoon.  I answered, thinking we would talk about what happened and get it out of our system so that we could move on with a friendship or whatever.  Well, I made the mistake of thinking that he had any kind of balls, because he called and acted like nothing ever happened.  How the fuck are we supposed to be friends if we have all this shit that needs to be dealt with, and every time I try to talk about it he runs like the little vagina boy that he is???  So the conversation just pissed me off more than anything else and I was really short with him.  I could tell it was really awkward for him because I was being such a bitch and he didn't expect that because he's never ever seen that side of me before.  So after about 10 minutes of stupid small talk, (it was all him asking me questions because I could give a fuck what he's up to), he goes "Ok, well, I just wanted to say Hi and see how you're doing, and uh... (pause) I'm glad you're doing ok, and uh... (pause) I'll talk to you... sometime, and uh... (long pause) Stay cool."  I replied with "Bye."  Then I hung up and busted up laughing at his "Stay cool" comment.  What the fuck was that???  Are you saying bye, or signing my 6th grade yearbook?  K.I.T.  Have a kick ass summer!  HAHAHA!  What a jackass.  After I wiped the tears of laughter off my face I felt a little bad for acting the way I did, but I was pissed.  It's really, really hard to make me mad, but when you do... watch out!  All he has to do is talk to me about what happened, and let both of us say what we need to say about it to get it out.  Without doing that there is no way we can have a good friendship because we're always going to have this shit we never dealt with buried deep down, and one day it's going to come out and explode.  Dammit!  Now I feel bad again for how I acted.  See?  I can't even be a bitch when I try because I just end up feeling bad.  Mannnnnnnn.  Ok, I'll write part 2 of my weekend tomorrow... Stay cool!  LOL!  Sorry, I couldn't resist.

      Or some more of that sex with FBI from last weekend.  Yum!  This week has pretty much been a train wreck!  Tuesday night Cop asks me if when his wife is around if I won't talk to him, or even acknowledge him, and he'll do the same to me.  He said we'll just have to act like we hate eachother.  This is because she gets really upset when she sees us getting along.  I was speechless when he said this, I got SO fuckin pissed!  I got up, walked out of the apartment, slammed the door and just started crying outside.  He asked me to come back inside so we could talk, I told him that I can't live like that, and if that's the way it's going to be I'm leaving.  He said that's not even an option.  So we got to talking about his wife and he said that her friendship with me is fake because she just turns around and talks shit behind my back.  I was like OH HELL NO!  So, I let a couple of her cats out of the bag and told him some shit she asked me not to.  So the next day they were fighting all day, and he told her everything I told him, and he said they need space and he doesn't want her coming to out apartment anymore.  Yay!  SOOOOO... OF COURSE, she starts blowing my phone up, leaving me voice mails saying thanks for destroying their family, and their kids can me to thank for taking their dad away from them, blah blah blah.  This bitch is crazy, she called 48 times that night!  I finally answered and told her to shove her voice mails up her ass.  If I wanted to break up their family so bad why would i volunteer to babysit so they can go on dates, and to counseling?  Why would I leave my own home on the weekends so they can have the apartment to themselves?  Why would I help pay his bills, and buy groceries for their fuckin family???  I also admitted to telling Cop everything because he told me how 2 faced she is, and how much shit she talks behind my back.  Of course, she denied everything, said he's a liar and said he's the one that talks all the shit about me.  She started saying some of the things that he supposedly says, and I started to believe her because there's no way she could've made some of it up.  So I'm like wow!  This is my so called best friend saying this shit about me.  I'm sitting there crying my eyes out on the phone with her telling her I'm tired of both of their head games, and I need to leave and get out of the situation.  Then she started acting hella nice telling me that he's my best friend and he does care about me, and that I can't leave.  Now, the ONLY reason both of them are so adamant about me staying is because he can not survive financially without me.  There is no possible way he can afford to live on his own right now.  He can't even pay his 1/2 of the rent and utilities!  I pay the fuckin utilities!  He also has nowhere to go, so if I leave, he's fucked.  Which right now sounds pretty good considering how much I've done for him, and what I've found out he's saying about me.  I told her I don't give a fuck what happens to him, he should've thought about that before he opened his mouth.  This whole conversation she's telling me how she doesn't need him, and she's ready to finish off the divorce, and move on.  So we finally get off the phone at like 1am, I go to sleep.  Then, from 3-3:30am my phone is ringing non stop, I pick it up and it's her, crying.  She said that Cop had turned his phone off that's why she keeps calling me, then she starts asking me why I would do this to their family, and the least I could do is tell him he's making a mistake and to let her stay at our apartment.  I told her I don't owe either of them shit, that she needs to get some sleep, and I hung up.  The next morning Cop asks me why I'm dragging ass and I told him that because he turned his phone off, his psycho fuckin wife wouldn't stop calling me all night.  He had nothing to say to that.  Yesterday I called Cop's mom and we had lunch together.  I told her everything, and asked her advice.  She said I need to tell both of them that I don't want anything to do with their marriage and not to ever talk to me about eachother again, to keep me out of it.  So yesterday I told Cop's wife exactly that.  She said ok.  I haven't talked to Cop yet, not a word.  I don't even want to face him.  The things that she told me he said about me are so fucked up.  So yesterday I got home, went straight to bed at 5:30, and woke up this morning at 7am.  Tonight I'm going out for lots and lots of drinks with my old roommate, and going to the bay area for more drinking this weekend.  I guess I'll decide what I need to do about the living situation next week when I sober up.

      Oooooooooooh what a great weekend!  I went to San Jose to spend the weekend with my brothers.  Well, on Sunday, FBI shows up at my brother's house because my brother invited him to go to my cousin's bbq with us. =)  He and I started hooking up over a year ago.  It happened the first time on my 23rd birthday, a VERY drunk 23rd birthday.  It was really weird the next morning when we first realized what happened just because he's been a friend of the family since I was born.  He's 33.  He's also my brother in law's, and my brother's best friend.  Anyway, so that's the first time it happened, and it's happened many times since.  My brother was a little pissed off about it at first, but he's used to the idea by now and it doesn't seem to bother him anymore.  Actually, on Sunday night, when we got back to his house, my brother threw us two pillows and one blanket and goes "here you guys, here's so you can make a bed."  I was surprised, and happy that it obviously doesn't bother him anymore.  I think he realizes that FBI is a really great guy, and I could definitely do worse.  So, anyway, FBI shows up and we go to my cousin's bbq.  It was so much fun.  He also taught me the "correct" way to stand, and shoot a gun, I'm really starting to get into shooting so that was awesome.  The reason I'm so attracted to him, besides the fact that he's hot, AND in the FBI is because he is the biggest gentleman I've ever met in my life.  I LOVE that!  There is nothing in the world better than a true gentleman.  When he's around, I never have to lift a finger, or ask for anything, because he takes such good care of me.  He's always asking if I want a drink, if I'm hungry, if I'm comfortable, if I'm hot or cold.    When we were driving home Sunday night he let me sleep on his lap and he just ran his fingers through my hair, and rubbed my back.  That night, of course, we had lots of sex, (it was great this time!) ;) and it was really cold, so he held me all night and kept asking if I was warm enough.  We woke up at like 7am, had some more sex, cuddled some more, then he had to leave to put new flooring in at his house.  So, here comes the hard part... this occasional hook up is great and all, but every time I see him I like him even more (if that's possible).  He got divorced about a year and a half ago, and really isn't looking for a relationship at all.  Ugh!  Why do feelings always have to get in the way???  Ok, so, We talk on the phone occasionally, so I've been thinking about calling him and asking him to go to that wedding with me at the end of the month, but I'm scared to.  I don't know why, I'm sure he'd say yes, but I'm just nervous.  I'd like him to go with me mostly because he's so fun to be with, he's friendly to everyone, he loves to dance, he's just great.  And second, wouldn't it be funny to see marine's face if I brought Mr. HOT FBI??? ;)  Now I just need to grow some balls and ask him!

      Last night Cop and I had a long talk about everything that's happened and&nbsp;we both &nbsp;said everything&nbsp;we needed to say.&nbsp; I told him exactly how I felt about his bounced check, about him talking shit, about his wife... everything.&nbsp; He took it really really well, and actually apologized for a lot of it, which is huge for him.&nbsp; There was no arguing, it was very positive, and in the end he agreed to sign the release form.&nbsp; The four of them are going to move in with his mom and stepdad until he finds out what's going on with LAPD.&nbsp; We both left the conversation feeling really good about it.&nbsp; He was also lecturing me about going back to school and getting a degree, that actually turned into more of a counseling session, but it was good.&nbsp; I told him about my weekend and told him all the people I ran into that we went to high school with.&nbsp; He was excited to hear about everyone and what they're up to.&nbsp; Then we started talking about the way we were in high school.&nbsp; God, I miss those days.&nbsp; He was Mr. Popular, the quarterback, basketball star, track star, Homecoming King, and I was the new girl.&nbsp; I caught his eye and from day one we were inseparable.&nbsp; Every girl in the school had a huge crush on him so when I came along and took all his attention of course they all hated me.&nbsp; They would spread rumors and talk shit, but it never bothered us.&nbsp; We were so happy spending time together all the time, and just having fun that we never paid attention to any of the bullshit.&nbsp; Nothing could get in our way.&nbsp; Well, until he married the mexican  urlLink antichrist .&nbsp; She is the one thing in the world that could get in our way, and she did.&nbsp; I hope we can still be friends to some degree, but I'm happy that I still have those memories of the "good ol' days".&nbsp; Now I have to get ready to move in 2 weeks, AHHH!&nbsp; Thank you all for your advice!   Ok, since you guys are so good at giving advice.&nbsp; I need to know what to do about this wedding I have to go to on the 24th.&nbsp;  urlLink Marine  is going to be there, and I need to figure out how to deal with that.&nbsp; I could go with my old roommate, who is a female.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would probably just go to the ceremony and skip the reception, I really don't want to sit there in the same room with Marine the whole night without a date.&nbsp; Then I'm sure we would go to a club again that night, and maybe meet  urlLink 6pack  there.&nbsp; UNLESS... I ask  urlLink FBI  to go with me, then we would definitely go to the reception (and maybe make marine a little jealous ;) ).&nbsp; He's so much fun, he's so friendly, and loves to dance.&nbsp; Or I could just make up some excuse for why I couldn't go to the wedding at the last minute and skip it altogether.&nbsp; Hmmmm.... What do you think?

      Today at lunch, I went to the apartment office to talk to them about what I can do if he won't sign the roommate release form to let me go.  The guy freaked out and said he wanted nothing to do with our problems, and to keep him out of it.  I was like WTF?  He said that Cop went in there yesterday and made a scene calling the guy in the office a racist, and accused him of using racial slurs, blah blah blah.  I was like OMG!  I am so sorry!  I have no idea where he got that from, I know you never said anything like that.  Then I realized that all of this is being communicated through Kito's wife.  I explained that to the guy and said that obviously that's where things are getting twisted.  Then the manager was telling me that yesterday Cop took a Roommate Release form and that she was under the impression that he would agree to sign it.  She said it sounded to her like this was a mutual decision.  Now his wife said she never said that, and Cop says he never told the guy in the office anything like that.  Can you say compulsive liars boys and girls?

      This morning Cop's wife called me and asks if I had called the Apt. office again to ask if Cop has paid the rent.  I hadn't talked to them today, so I called again and the guy at the office said no.  He also said that if it wasn't paid by 10am tomorrow they will take us to court, then we have to pay the court costs on top of what Cop owes.  So I call his wife back and tell her no, he hasn't paid it.  She called him and he told her that guy is trippin that he never told her he'd pay it yesterday, he said he'd pay it Thursday.  Umm... you can't fuckin pay it Thursday asshole!  The notice said 3 days from Sunday!  His wife starts telling me how I need to call him and make things right.  Fuck that!  I don't have to do shit.  I'm not the one that fucked up.  I'm tired of always being the one to make things right.  This is his fault, and his responsibility.  He needs to fuckin own up to it, and be a man.  Instead he acts like a fuckin dickhead and pretends nothing happened.  His wife said it's frustrating for her that we don't talk.  Sorry!  Then leave!  I asked the guy at the office what it would take to transfer my lease to a one bedroom.  He said that in my case he would make an exception.  It would take a little extra money in the beginning, but I think it would be well worth it, especially since I can't afford to move to the bay area yet.    Here's an update for ya since my post this morning... Cop's wife told him that I'm moving out, and he threw a fit.  She told him he better make things right with me or I'll leave and he won't have anywhere to go.  He said that won't be a problem because he'll never sign the roommate release form, and that he won't let me leave over something so stupid.  So, now I'm stuck at his fuckin mercy.  He'd rather both of us be totally miserable and have me stuck there with him than accept what he's done and let me move on.  He told his wife that he won't talk to me because I'm mad at him.  Ummmm hello you fuck!  If you do something wrong, and piss someone off, it's your fuckin responsibility to go to them and make it right.  AAAAAHHHHHH!  I don't know what to do.  I'm at a loss.

      Yesterday Cop's mom called me to see how everything is going.  We went to lunch the other day and I told her everything that happened, so yesterday when she called I told her about his bounced check.  She was pissed!  She said she hates to say this about her son but that he's clearly been taking advantage of me for like 5 months now and I need to say fuck him and take care of myself.  So, what I think I'm going to do is see if I can get my lease transfered to a one bedroom in the same complex.  He can't afford to live on his own, so either his wife is going to have to move in with him and get a job, or he's going back to his mom's house.  Either way, I don't give a fuck.  He could live in a dumpster for all I care.  Yesterday when I was on the phone with his mom he called me from a blocked number and left me a voicemail saying he doesn't know why I didn't come home for lunch yesterday but that he's not mad at me so I don't need to try to avoid him.  Ummm... hold on, he's not mad at me?  Thank god, I was so worried he'd be mad at me because HE BOUNCED HIS OWN FUCKING RENT CHECK!  Well thank god he's not mad at me because HE fucked up MY rental history.  What a prick!  What the fuck could he possibly be mad at me about?  Did I bounce my rent check, and blow it off like it's nothing?  Am I the one that was talking shit, and insulting him behind his back?  Am I the one that constantly lies to him?  Did I try to move my family in to our apartment without him knowing and say he'll just have to get over it???  I've never wanted to punch him in his face so hard in my life!  So last night I get home and play with the babies for a while.  (the little one laughed for the first time yesterday when I was playing with him, it was the cutest thing ever!)  His wife gives me the 3rd degree about why I didn't come home for lunch.  She's really starting to irritate me with this always having to know where I am bullshit.  You're not my mom, Fuck off!  So I just spend most of the evening watching this documentary about the war in Iraq, and they ask me to sit and eat dinner with them.  Um, kiss my ass.  Then they ask if I want to watch a movie.  Um, go to hell.  Then Cop offers me a popsicle.  Um, shove it up your ass.  Of course I didn't say these things, I just shook my head no every time.  Sorry, it may seem like I'm being bitchy, but it's because I can't fuckin stand when there's a huge problem and people won't deal with it.  He hasn't apologized one single time for any of the things he's done, all he does is lie.  So until he can be a fuckin man, and own up to the shit he's done, he can kiss my ass.  I don't have a fuckin word to say to him.  Ok enough of that.  I got a e-mail back from Fireman today.  He just asked how I've been, what I've been up to, basic stuff.  I'm really curious to see where this will go.  I was dating him for a little while when I was broken up with mama's boy, then we got back together and I stopped calling Fireman.  What a mistake!  He is so freakin hot!    I'm debating going to stay this weekend with my old roommate in the bay area so we can meet up with 6pack.  Then again, I'm tired as hell and should probably just stay home and catch up on sleep.  Hmmmm...  I still haven't asked FBI to the wedding.  I should probably do it soon.  Grow some balls Elizabeth, Jesus!  Maybe I'll just go with my old roommate and we can go to a club or something that night.  Dammit, I don't know what to do.  Oh yeah!  I got a letter a couple days ago from Army.  He's doing well.  He said it's really tough out there and thanked me for the care package.  I had asked him when he thinks he'll be coming home, he said probably either in January, or next July.  I was so sad after reading that, i hate thinking about him being over there in combat, having to kill or be killed on a daily basis.  At the same time I admire his strength, and courage so much.  He truly is an amazing person.  I have to write him back tonight.

      Wow!  What a weekend!  I'll start from the beginning.  Friday night I went out with my old roommate and 2 other girl-friends.  We went to this club downtown, it was pretty fun.  Nothing really exciting happened that night.  So we go back to one of the other girl's apartments to stay the night and I sleep on an air mattress next to her little frog aquarium, well the frogs had sex all night!  Noisy sex!  I was like dude, what the fuck are your frogs doing in there?  She said they're nymphos.  Those little bitches kept me up all night!    Saturday we went to the bay area and I met up with  my friend there that's about to get married.  It was her fiance's bachelor party on Saturday so we went shopping all day to get out of the house.  The guys told us we weren't supposed to be home until 10pm, but at 9:30 she decides she wants to drive by the house to see what's going on.  Well, she sees a stripper getting changed in her spare bedroom window and freaks out.  She runs in there and makes a scene saying that she wants that fuckin bitch out of her house, blah blah blah.  I tried really really hard to keep her away from that house, but she was adamant about going and since she was driving I couldn't do anything about it.  Long story short, she realized how rediculous she was acting she apologized to all the guys, told the stripper to stay and dance, and we left to a club.    So we go to this club, and we meet my old roommate there.  At about midnight my friend decides she needs to go home to talk to her fiance.  So she leaves and my old roommate and I keep drinking.  I was drinking long islands, so I was getting very drunk, very fast. ;)  I was walking to the dance floor and this guy grabs me by the arm and says "I want your number"  I was like "You NEED some manners!"  and kept walking.  Fuckin moron.  So this hot guy I had been checking out most of the night comes up to me and tells me I have a beautiful smile, and asks me to save a dance for him.  Then about 30-40 minutes and 3 long islands later I'm dancing and he comes to dance with me.  He said that it was his 25th birthday, so he's out celebrating.  We danced the rest of the night and kissed a few times. ;) I really don't remember some of the night, but I do remember his 6 pack, oh my god!  We were dancing, and i put my hands on his chest, then i felt his stomach... he had the most perfect 6pack ever!  So that's what we'll call him, 6pack.  I get all warm just thinking about it =)  He's totally a thug, which is the only type I used to date.  He's really nice though, and hot!    Next thing I know I'm at this apartment and it's packed with all the people that were at the club.  A fight breaks out between 2 girls and everybody gets involved, everyone's screaming and pushing eachother.  Then the guy who lives there gets up on the kitchen counter and screams "All yall mothafuckas need to get the fuck out my house!  Right now god dammit!  All yall!"  While all this is going on, this guy, who is a cousin of the guys that live there, was hitting on me, telling me he needs to talk to me outside.  I had taken my shoes off because they were way too hard to walk in when I was drunk, so he gave me a pair of slippers to put on so I could go outside to talk to him.  I get out there and he just keeps pulling me close and trying to kiss me, so I kept pushing him away, and finally went back inside.    The next thing I remember is waking up in the morning on this janky ass futon mattress in a bedroom I've never seen.  I felt like shit!  I was half hungover, half drunk, my head was pounding, it was hot as hell, and I felt like I was going to throw up.  I turn over and the guy who lives there (that was screaming at everyone to leave) was laying next to me asleep.  I was like oh fuck!  What did I do???  Then I realized we were both fully clothed, and nothing happened.  So I get up to find some excedrine and I see my old roommate laying on the floor on the other side of the room.  Man, was I happy to see her!  So I threw up a couple times, and we finally left there at like noon.  We went to her parents house and I took a shower and went to lunch with my friend that's getting married, and her fiance.  As soon as i smelled my food I had to throw up again.  After that I was fine though, I think I just had to get out the last little bit of alcohol.  Then we went to Target and they dropped me off at my old roommate's parents house.  The two of us went to this bbq for our friend's birthday, and everyone that was at the apartment the night before was there.  We get there, I look like shit and have a huge bottle of water, while everyone else is drinking Heineken.  If I got a nickel for everyone that told me how fucked up I was the night before, I'd be rich!  After we were at the bbq for a while I caught a train to come home, and while I'm on the train guess who calls!  6pack!  I didn't even know I gave him my #!  So we talked for a while and he's saying how he wants to see me again.  I told him maybe this weekend or the following one.  After we get off the phone and I call my old roommate to tell her he called.  Here is how the conversation went:  ME:  Dude, that hot guy I danced with last night just called me.  I didnt even know I gave him my #! HER: You didn't, I did. ME:  What?  Why did YOU give him my #? HER: Because he asked me for it. ME:  Why did he ask you? HER: Because your drunk ass couldn't remember it. ME:  HAHAHAHAHAHA!  Wait you fucker, how did you know I wanted him to have it?  Did you give it to anyone else? HER: Ummm because he was hot, and no, that other guy that told you he wanted your # asked me for it too, but I told him I didn't know it. ME:  Good job!   HER: I know.  So that was my weekend.  THEN... I get home and there is a notice on my front door, I open it up and it says that Cop bounced his fuckin rent check.  It said he has to pay it plus $75 or they'll take us to court.  I swear to god if he doesn't pay it, i'll saw his nuts off with a plastic butter knife!  I was so tired, but I was pissed and determined to stay up to yell at him when he got home.  I ended up passing out at the kitchen table, and guess who wakes me up!  Cop's wife!  Instead of waking up from a nightmare, I woke up into one.  I definitely didn't want to deal with her so I just went straight to bed.  I thought she wasn't supposed to come over anymore!  Tonight I'm going home to watch An Officer and a Gentleman, and go to bed early.    Oh!  One more thing, I got an e-mail from Fireman today.  It was just a FWD of a picture of some freak.  But there were 2 weird things about it, #1 he sent it to my work e-mail and I don't give that out to anyone for personal e-mail, so I have NO idea how he got it, and #2 he's never e-mailed me before at all.  So, just to see if there was anything to it.  I replied with a quick note that said something like "How funny!  Thanks!  How've you been?"  He just recently broke up with his girlfriend, so I'm interested to see what he has to say.  My priority right now is to get the courage to ask FBI to go to that wedding with me.  Alright, that's it for now.  Hasta Manana!  PS For anyone new to the blog that doesn't know who any of the people I'm talking about are, read my very first blog, it explains everything =)

           Well, it's Friday and tomorrow's the wedding.&nbsp; I've tried to think of every possible excuse to get out of it, but I just can't.&nbsp; So tonight after work I'll take the train to the bay area and stay the night with my old roommate.&nbsp; Then tomorrow we'll go to the wedding and MAYBE the reception.&nbsp; I don't know about that yet though.&nbsp; All I promised was the ceremony, so she can't get mad if I don't go to the reception.&nbsp; I would love to go to the reception, if only Marine wasn't going to be there.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really don't want to see him.&nbsp; It really sucks that FBI couldn't go with me, that would've been great!&nbsp; I'll definitely update you on all of this on Monday.  Nothing else is really going on.&nbsp; Cop has been calling me a few times a day just to talk.&nbsp; He's been really really nice.&nbsp; He's even told me he loves me a few times, just like the good ol' days.&nbsp; I really think I made the right decision by getting us to separate.&nbsp; Our friendship has already gotten that much better.&nbsp; He hasn't moved his stuff out yet, but he hasn't been staying at the apartment at all.&nbsp;   FBI is going to my (and his) hometown today for a week of training.&nbsp; My younger sister said that she's going with my older sister, my brother-in-law, Fireman, and FBI to a Kenny Chesney concert next weekend.&nbsp; She said she wished I could go.&nbsp; So do I!  Gotta go back to work, more later...

      Yesterday FBI called and said his friend has a  urlLink Glock 23 &nbsp;for me, and that it's $600.&nbsp; Seems like a lot, but I trust him so I said I would get it in a couple weeks.&nbsp; He also said he was going to Home Depot last night to look and see what he can do for my sliding glass door.&nbsp; Then he told me that I probably should tell my brother.&nbsp; I tried to tell him why I didn't want to tell him, but he didn't really give me a choice.&nbsp; So, I called and told my brother and, just as I expected, he started yelling at me.&nbsp; First he was telling me I need to move right now, that I could move in with him and his wife, or my other brother and his girlfriend.&nbsp; Ummm, one brother has a one bedroom apartment, and the other has a psychotic girlfriend.&nbsp; So, thanks but no thanks.&nbsp; We had a very long talk about all of this and he told me that I am NOT getting a gun.&nbsp; Well, if you know me, you know I don't like being told what to do.&nbsp; I can't stand it.&nbsp; So this method wasn't productive at all.&nbsp; Finally he made me realize that I should put that $600 towards moving to the bay area, and ask Cop if I can keep his  urlLink Glock 20 &nbsp;just until I move, that way I can feel safe and save money to move.&nbsp; This method worked, he got his way... I'm not buying a gun, and I got mine, I'll still have one while I live in that apartment.&nbsp; I called FBI this morning to tell him my decision and he was supportive, he would still like me to have one just because he knows that I know how to use it if I need to, and he would feel better knowing I can protect myself.&nbsp; So that's that I guess.&nbsp; I do still want a gun of my own one day, but I think this is the best thing for right now.&nbsp; Anyway... the wedding is this weekend, I do not want to go!&nbsp; I asked my sister if showing up drunk to a church is a bad thing she replied " I'm going to go ahead and say no, because priests always do.&nbsp; So no, it's not a bad thing." &nbsp; haha!&nbsp; I love her!

      Cop's wife is pregnant!&nbsp; Yes, I said it.&nbsp; Pregnant!&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; The baby is only 3 months old!&nbsp; She found out yesterday, and the Dr. told her that this pregnancy could be life threatening for her and that if she did decide to keep it she would be on bed rest for 9 months.&nbsp; So, together, they made the decision not to keep it.&nbsp; Now, I'm totally against abortion.&nbsp; BUT... there are 2 other very young lives in that family that need consideration as well.&nbsp; Even if the pregnancy was successful, she would have to be in bed for the next 8 or so months, which means she wouldn't be able to care for the 2 little ones they already have as well as she should be able to.&nbsp; And God forbid she dies because of this pregnancy and leaves the 2 babies behind with no mother.&nbsp; So, in this case, I support her decision because it is for the sake of her own health, and&nbsp;the children that she already has. &nbsp; Enough of that though, not much else is going on.&nbsp; The maintenance guy came and put a lock on my bedroom door. =)&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; I wasn't going to tell my brothers about what happened Saturday night because they're way too over protective, and instead of expressing concern they just yell at me like it's my fault.&nbsp; My sister in law found out and told me I HAVE to tell my brother, especially if i'm getting&nbsp;a gun.&nbsp; FBI is one of my brother's best friends, and he agreed with me that I shouldn't tell them because they react like assholes.&nbsp; So, I'm going to keep it that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they don't know, they can't yell at me for.&nbsp; I sent Army another letter today, I'm going to try to write to him once a week so he's constantly getting mail.&nbsp; Hopefully that will keep his morale up a little.&nbsp; That's about all I have to say today I guess, pretty boring, I know.&nbsp; See ya!

          I never thought i'd be glad to be back at work!&nbsp; This weekend had the potential to be good, but it sucked.&nbsp; Friday night I didn't really do anything watched some movies and passed out early.&nbsp; Saturday I went to the apartment office and took the release that Cop had signed so that I can get my new apartment.&nbsp; Well, the trick in the office said that I would have to sign a new lease for either 6 or 12 months to get the new apartment.&nbsp; Ummm... fuck that!&nbsp; I'm not stayin in this ghetto ass complex for another 6 months or a year.&nbsp; So I told her nevermind, I'll just keep the 2 bedroom apt that I live in now so I can leave in 3 months.&nbsp; I haven't talked about where I live before, but believe me it's not cool.&nbsp; Within the first month that I lived there a cop pulled me over and asked me if I was lost.&nbsp; Then he told me that I don't belong in an area like this, so I better move because he doesn't want to take me out in a body bag.&nbsp; Hmmmm... do you think I listened?&nbsp; Nooooo.&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; 9 months later, I'm still there.&nbsp; There are shootings, fights, car jackings, tons of drugs, robberies, rapes... you name it.&nbsp; The ghetto bird flies over every single night.&nbsp; So, yeah, living by myself doesn't really sound appealing.&nbsp; On Saturday night I was up watching TV at like 1am when someone jiggles the door knob on my front door, then they start shaking it really hard, then they start kicking it, like trying really hard to kick it in.&nbsp; So I grabbed my phone, ran in Cop's room (he wasn't&nbsp;home by the way) and&nbsp;got his gun.&nbsp; I called 911 and the dumb bitch was telling me to go look and see if someone got in, i&nbsp;was&nbsp;like "jesus christ you suck at your&nbsp;job!"&nbsp; So finally,&nbsp;after 12 minutes the cops got there and said they didn't see anyone outside, to lock up, be safe, and call if anything else happens.&nbsp; Blah blah blah... On Sunday I called FBI and told him what happened, and asked if he would help me get something to protect myself like pepper spray or a gun or something.&nbsp; He asked what I wanted and I told him a gun.&nbsp; He said he'll have one for me by the time Cop moves out.&nbsp; He also said he will come and fix my sliding glass door, to make it safer.&nbsp; God, I love him.&nbsp; Ok, I don't actually "love" him, but he is great!&nbsp; OH!&nbsp; I also asked him about the wedding and he said yes, but then remembered he's going&nbsp;out of town for training on Friday so he won't be here.&nbsp; He apologized like 100 times, it was very cute.&nbsp; Ok, I'm tired of typing.&nbsp; See ya!

      Ok, maybe that's a little extreme, but I'm really over all this shit that comes along with being a woman.&nbsp; I've had cramps for the last 3 days straight.&nbsp; I'm going to have to go to rehab for my advil addiction after this.&nbsp; This is crap.&nbsp; What do guys have to deal with?&nbsp; Morning wood?&nbsp; Seriously, women really got the short end of the stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think&nbsp;it's all because of that god damn Eve and the stupid apple she just had to eat.&nbsp; I'd really like to kick her ass right now.&nbsp; Ok, I just had to let that out.&nbsp; I'll have a better post tomorrow.&nbsp; Adios!

      Yes, I survived the wedding!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Well, I wouldn't have without the very large cooler of jungle juice that was there.&nbsp; On Saturday, I had butterflies... no, more like bald eagles in my stomach.&nbsp; Not good ones, where you're excited for something, but the evil kind that just remind you how much you dread what you're about to do.&nbsp; So we pull up to the church, and it's tiny!&nbsp; It seats maybe 50 people.&nbsp; The first thing I saw was Marine's car in the parking lot and I was going to be sick.&nbsp; I made my old roommate pull over so I could throw up.&nbsp; I got back in the car and was like "Dude, I don't wanna go."&nbsp; She said too bad, we're going!&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; We get inside and I couldn't see him anywhere, so I felt a little better, until I heard his voice right behind me.&nbsp; The wedding was only about 10 minutes long, and it seemed like 10 years.&nbsp; The reception was right after the wedding, so we decided to go.&nbsp; We get there and my old roommate insists we sit at this table that's right in the front, right where the food line would be.&nbsp; Guess who sits at the table right next to us?&nbsp; Yes, Marine.&nbsp; All I can think is how badly I need a drink.&nbsp; We keep making eye contact and then looking away.&nbsp; After like 10 minutes he came over to our table and was like "Hey stranger!&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; You look good!&nbsp; Give me a hug."&nbsp; I was tempted to punch him in his face, but instead I was nice.&nbsp; We made small talk then he went back to his table.&nbsp; About 15 minutes later he came back saying how his table sucks because it's all married people with kids.&nbsp; He did a lot of little things to make me realize how full of himself he really is, and how he's not at all the person I thought he was.&nbsp; He would say things like "Hey, do you want some jungle juice?" &nbsp; I'd say yeah and he'd be like "It's right there, you should get some."&nbsp; Ummmm why the fuck did you ask me if I want some if you're just going to tell me to go get it?&nbsp; Jackass!&nbsp; When the groom heard him say that he was like "Jesus dude, what a gentleman!&nbsp; Here, I'll get you some Elizabeth."&nbsp; All Marine talked about was himself, even during his drunken toast to the bride and groom.&nbsp; It was all about them being there for him when he was in the Marine Corps, and everywhere he went, and all the girls he's been through.&nbsp; I swear to God if the jungle juice had a tap I would've been doing keg stands on it when he made that toast.&nbsp; He kept asking what I was going to do that night, and I kept telling him I don't know.&nbsp; Then this guy I knew from high school invited me to go to his house after the reception because he was having a party, so I said we'd go, and Marine got pissed.&nbsp; He asked if we could talk and told me what a mistake he made, that he&nbsp;just felt&nbsp;a lot of pressure because it all became real&nbsp;when he came to see me,&nbsp;&nbsp;and how he wishes he could fix what he did.&nbsp; I told him he can't, that I don't trust him.&nbsp; What if a few years down the road we were going to get married, and he felt too much "pressure" again and ran away on our wedding day like he did once before.&nbsp; I told him I can't live with that in the back of my head.&nbsp; So, after that we went back inside and drank some more.&nbsp; Then my old roommate and I left, changed, and went to that guy's house.&nbsp; It was ok, nothing really special about the rest of the night.&nbsp; Just drank and played cards.&nbsp; We went to a club for a little bit after that but my old roommate was in a really bad mood, so it obviously wasn't fun.&nbsp; That's about it, didn't do anything on Sunday, just came home.&nbsp; Cop was there (alone), so I talked to him for a few minutes, then he had to get on the road so he could drive to LA for another step in the background process for LAPD.&nbsp;   Ok, now for the GOOD part of the weekend.&nbsp; When we were driving to the wedding my phone rang, and it was Army!&nbsp; This was the first phone call he's made since he's been in Iraq.&nbsp; He got my letter that I sent 2 weeks ago about all the stuff I was going through with Cop.&nbsp; He was pissed!&nbsp; He used his friend's account to call me to make sure everything was ok now, and to tell me that if there's anything he can do from there to let him know and he'll do it.&nbsp; I was like oh my god, how great are you???&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; He's out there in Iraq, in 150 degree weather, in full combat every single day, and asking if there's anything he can do for me.&nbsp; The first phone call he's made in 4 months is to make sure I'm ok.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I was seriously at a loss for words.&nbsp; We talked for like 10-15 minutes, then my stupid god damn cell&nbsp;phone dropped the call and he couldn't call me back because he was on his friend's account.&nbsp; It was SO SO SO good to talk to him though.&nbsp; He said he wants to spend a few days with me when he gets his leave after he comes home from Iraq, and he said he wants me to visit him in Germany.&nbsp; I'd really like to figure out a way to be able to do that.&nbsp; Anyway, that was my weekend.&nbsp; I better get back to work.&nbsp; See ya!

          I can't believe it's finally Friday!  I'm going to visit my brother's his weekend in San Jose since my little sister is coming into town.  I'm staying with one of my brothers and his girlfriend who i HATE!  But, I'm going to take one for the team and go so that I can hang out with the siblings.  My little sister is coming up to see me next weekend, so I'm looking forward to that.  Right now I'm especially looking forward to getting on the train after work and sleeping for about an hour or so until we ride along the bay, then I'll wake up to see the view.  It's beautiful!  I've been e-mailing back and forth with First today.  Come to find out he's married with a 2 year old little boy.  The funny thing is we were talking about famous people we're attracted to and he said that he and his wife have given eachother "free passes" to have sex with certain celebrities if given the chance.  However, he said that she added me onto his "free" list because (and I quote)  " well she told me that out of all the girls in the world that aren't famous, you are the only one I'm allowed to have sex with cause she is embarrassed cause she thinks you are just laughing at her cause her man is weak. "  Isn't that helarious?  I sure thought so.  Obviously, I'm sure it's a joke.  But if it's not... hmmmm....  ; )

      This has been a very interesting week. Sorry I haven't posted in a while, I didn't even realize it had been so long. Work has been busy, and well... I'll tell you the rest now. The weekend was boring, I'm broke as fuck since Cop moved out because now I have to take over his half of the rent along with everything else. So I stayed home all weekend and just watched movies & cleaned the apartment. On Monday night I talked to  Cuddle Bitch  and he was saying he wanted to see me because he hasn't seen me in a long time. So I told him he could come over if he wanted. He did, we watched TV for a while, then we were hooking up (no sex) and he got all shy and nervous all of a sudden. He always does this, and I'm always like WTF? So, I was like ok, what's up? He said that he was nervous, I was like about what? He said he doesn't want to do anything wrong, or be bad. I was like bad at what? We're not having sex, and you're doing just fine anyway. He said that I intimidate him because i'm so much more "experienced" than he is. LOL!!! I was like haha! wtf is that supposed to mean??? and how would YOU know how experienced I am? He was like no no, don't take it wrong. I'm just saying I can tell you know what you're doing, and I don't want to be bad at what I'm doing. Long story short, that killed the mood so we just talked for a while then fell asleep. He was telling me I need to help break him of those thoughts, and help him come out of his shell. No thanks, that's way too much work. So we fell asleep after a while then the next morning he got up, gave me a kiss, and left at like 6am. I'm not even really sure what to say about that. Comedy.  So, Tuesday night I finally got internet at home so I'm messing around on Yahoo and go to a chat room. Any women who have been in an internet chat room know that every IM you get is going to say "A/S/L?", "wanna cyber?", "what are you wearing?" or my personal favorite "wanna have some fun?" No. No. No. No. NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. To all of those questions. If you ever IM a woman with any of those, stick your dick in a George Foreman grill and put a 10 lb weight on it. You don't deserve to have one. Anyway... I get this IM that says "Hi, I'm ' Patterson '" (which of course isn't his real name, it's the town he lives in) He totally got my attention because he seemed normal! So we started talking and it turns out he just got out of the Army ;) and is absolutely fuckin GORGEOUS! Like... whoa! He's puerto rican/hawaiian. 100% my type. Yum! So, we're talking, and after a while he asks if he can call me, I say sure. All of a sudden he starts making plans for us to see eachother, and for me to go up to his dad's house with him, and go visit him where he lives. I was like whoaaaaaaaaa, take a deep breath dude. So we talked again last night and he was talking about the possibility of us being together one day, and all kinds of stuff like that. Then he kept apologizing and saying that he has a habit of vocalizing his thoughts when he shouldn't. He's really sweet, and very respectful, so if I can get him to slow down a little then this could be the beginning of a beautiful... something! haha! He went to look at colleges in Southern Cali this weekend, and said he'd call when he got back. God he's HOT!  Today I'm at work when I get an e-mail from this guy we'll call....  First . He was my very first boyfriend in the 5th grade. We also dated a little bit in high school, and had sex once the summer after our Senior year. He found my e-mail address on an alumni site for our high school. Here's a piece of his e-mails:   "Holy crap!  (my name), I'm in awe right now!  Let me tell you, out of all people that I want to see from high school, you are number one my list. I owe you the biggest apology in the world. one for not ever keeping in touch and two for such a terrible performance. We were just talking about you, we being me and ----- --------. he is in town right now for his accounting firm and we went out last night. they make fun of me all the time cause I told them my performance wasn't very impressive nor long. so they laugh at me. every time I listen to K-Ci & JoJo I think damn. you know I didn't even finish a song. that is a damn shame. actually it is probably good cause now I am educated and at least know what the hell I am doing and.... lets just say you might not make it through the first song. wow can you believe that?  did you know you were my first "girlfriend" and you were also my first, first. I had messed around a lot but you were the one I said "f-ck it" (no pun intended).  all I can say is I'm really glad I found you again."   When I read that I was his "first, first" I could not believe it! He was SOOOOO hot! He was Mr. Popularity at our high school. The Quarterback, basketball, & track star, Homecoming King.... all that stuff, and I was his first when we were 18 years old??? Wow! I was very flattered. I tried to reassure him and told him that it wasn't bad, but it really was! haha! But now I know why, it was his first time! I would love to take him up on what he said about me not lasting through a song this time though. I know he can only have gotten hotter since High School. It was really good to hear from him again though, he said he's not going to let us lose touch again. ;)  Oh yeah, M.N... in response to the comment you wrote the other day, read  urlLink my very first post . ;)
