      i thought i wanted him.. but now i relize were better off friend. i think we should have stayed that way.. becuz i am afraid i mest up a perfect relationship.. i wish feelings didn't have to get in the way..  .......sometimes i wish i could turn back the hands of time... but its not good to live in the past right?                                       move on everybody says... well i just don't know if there correct.

      he's gone completly.. i am soo happy to get him out of my life...i don't need that he's dumb... he's awful to me i don't know y i never saw it before everyone around me relized it...but i guess that my "friend" was right Love is blind...it can make u think things you would never think and do things you would never do...or say things you would never say...although it is the best feeling in the whole world...i've moved on found someone better to start over with...

      "Love..Love is a many splendid thing..Love lifts us up where we belong. All you need is love!"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't start that again.."(Moulin Rouge)  &nbsp;  "No sooner met but they looked;  No sooner looked but they loved;  No sooner loved but they sighed;  No sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason;  No sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy."(Shakespeare)  Love..is very important..but it is the most fragile and gentle thing in the world...it is very ...almost sacred thing.&nbsp; If you have it, it can be the most amazing thing in the world. Although it is these wonderful things it confuses me....someone please...  .................................................................Explain?.................................................................

      he wrote back with harsh words... Goodbye Katie.  that hurts, i don't want to be a drama queen but that cuts right through my heart..  he's my best friend. he can't be gone completly...can he?  you know people always say be honest and things will turn out alright and everybody will HONESTLY really be happy in the end...  but from my experience that doesn't work. everytime in my life lately that i've been honest it got screwed up.  now maybe i'm too honest or people can't take the truth but seriously WHAT AM I DOING WORNG!!!...i can't take this ne more.. i don't want to be here ne more..                       I can't deal...
