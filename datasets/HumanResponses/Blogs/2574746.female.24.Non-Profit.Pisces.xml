      tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.

      hmm...been quite busy.Returning to school after the December holidays...back to the regular routine of going to school,see the students impart some knowledge and etc.Guess what...just got my time table today.I will be having 6 periods of Art class per week.I did not remember attending any Art courses when I was in NIE.Nevertheless, you never expect the unexpected. Maybe,they did see the creative side of me working... somewhere.   Just did a little briefing for a dikir barat competition just now. At times, you tend to question why on  earth...do these students come all the way from Boon Lay just to be part of a performing art that they  really never understand.Sometimes,there is an urged to ask them, how deep do they feel for this art...but then again...I do have friends who are involved in the Arts scene for more than 10 years...their main concern was always profit making.They so called organised a certain event,drew up a budget,get sponsors...and guess what...just work on a smaller expenditure scale and then the rest is theirs to enjoy. Never understood the misunderstood...whatever that meant... How do they priorities their beliefs in a certain Art form...at the first place...hmm  I have to do a "lirik" for one of the dikir barat groups.Hmm...been thinking and dreaming about it.So far no concrete ideas to put on paper."Kurang Ajar" how do you define it... Sastera or literature...is a wide thing...there is no boundaries limiting our creativity.The irony part,was that...just heard a fellow writer saying during the briefing just now...that there is a certain kind of limitation in writing..duh~lucky he was not judging the "liriks".What a turn off ! Dr Hadijah Rahmat, once said that, "Writing is a form of beauty...there no right or wrong in delivering the ideas. A writer has to look at different angles when searching for ideas...but a good writer will look at an angle that others may preceive it as a norm thing, for example things...that we encounter in our everydaylife...into something so beautiful and at the same time critical..." hmm...5.12am,got to go to school at 8.30am...have to wake up at 6.00am and do my subuh...so wats new in life...adios~

      Tired...simple word.Been feeling exhausted these few days.During the staff meeting,announcement was made that by the begining of next year,we will have a new principal... I hope it is a good news... Yesterday, I did talk to a friend,it lasted for a few hours on the phone. Interesting guy...his perspectives in life, makes you look at things in a different angle.  Today marks the end of painful year,hearts broken,dreams shattered... but at the same time opening up doors to new exciting destinations...he..he ( i guess~ ) When I woke up from my beauty nap just now, I dreamt about brownies...tasty,dark,rich chocolate brownies.  Sms my sis to buy some of the ingredients when my attempt to NTUC failed...  2003-I will always remember it as the year of soul searching.

      hai there...hari ini saya ingin berbahasa Melayu pula.hmm...hari ini indah,panas seterik mentari.Baru habis mengetaip balik budget untuk Piala Tun Perak 2004, yang diiginkan oleh pengerusi MAEC kami. Tiket akan dijual pada harga $7.00 pada peringkat saringan dan $10.00 dolar bagi peringkat final.Penat.hari-hari saya penat...tulah hidup saya ni tak habis-habis dengan mengeluh.Semalam saya belum habis kemas workstation saya,masih berserak...baru ada niat dah kemas my friends dah heret saya pergi makan.Saya rasa saya dah gemuk disebabkab baru habiskan sekampit coklat...tu pun saya masih lapar lagi. Dahlah tu minum air Coke lepas tu ada niat di hati nak bake brownies lagi...heee...heee. Kerja sekolah banyak yang harus dibuat dan dilakarkan.Printer punya wire mana tah saya letak...tak dapat print barang so frustrating!!!! Tadi saya terfikir sejenak, Tuhan sengaja mengurniakan seseorang itu kelebihan ataupun kekurangan mesti ada sebabnya...Contohnya kalau dijadikan hensem gila,berkedudukan, mungkin tinggi melangit... jus a thot when I remembered a certain friend who seems to have everything...seems to have~pretenders,tak faham hamba.

      hmm...another day,another experience,encountering different types of people from all walks of life. Liriks...liriks,yet to be given to him by today.Promised him few days ago,still typing... thinking of new words to match the rima.Met my EM3 students,mostly boys,very tall,big size and some of them quite good looking. Laid out the rules and regulations.Met my guy friends at simpang bedok,talk about everything...it has been so long .Big...Zul or Fad, a creative individual...knew he was talented,a thinker,I remembered the times I sat next to him for two years in class.Debates...arguments...more debates.  My PC was down...a few minutes ago,I was feeling arghhhhh...down to de max. Now,okay already...he...he

      exhausted,hmm...the same old thing.My EM3 gave me a hell of a time.I was so frustrated that I could'nt control my temper.I shouted at one of the boys who was showing me his so called cool and defiant attitude...saya pun apa lagik. Truthfully,I could'nt control them.Hating them would be the last thing in my agenda.

      frenz come frenz go...seems like theres nothing in the world that I can believe in,for now.To trust and to be a believer ...at a certain point seems to put you in a pathetic situation.To luv someone and at the same time be crushed by him is heart breaking.Nevertherless,life has to move on,no matter how hard it is.hmm...things that couldn't break you,will make you stronger.Part and parcel of life...what to do.

           went out wif a fren just now, we went to catch a movie together,the school of rock. A typical story where everything so wrong juz become so perfect...kind of a motivational story. After de show,sat with her for hours,talking about life as she lights up her cigar one by one. As I look at her,Ive noticed something about her dat Ive never notice before,she's pretty and got a certain attitude dat I like.      Contacted a long lost fren,who was very dear to me once upon a time.hmm...he seems to have change alot.Still got that charismatic personality intact in him.Ive been listening to dewa's risalah hati,over n over again.kind of sick thou...yet healing.   Risalah Hati   Hidupku tanpa cintamu Bagai malam tanpa bintang Cintaku tanpa sambutmu Bagai panas tanpa hujan Jiwaku berbisik lirih ku harus milikimu  Aku bisa membuatmu jatuh cinta kepadaku Meski kau tak cinta...kepadaku Beri sedikit waktu biar cinta datang Karena telah terbiasa  Simpan mawar yang ku beri Mungkin wanginya mengilhami Sudikah dirimu untuk Kenali aku dulu Sebelum kau ludahi aku Sebelum kau robek hatiku  Aku bisa membuatmu jatuh cinta kepadaku Meski kau tak cinta...kau tak cinta Aku bisa membuatmu jatuh cinta kepadaku Meski kau tak cinta...kepadaku  Hidup tanpa cintamu Bagai malam tanpa bintang Cinta tanpa sambutmu Bagai panas tanpa hujan

      my webbie,something wrong wif it,cannot upload my pictures,been toying with it since 8 in the morning,dah malas sekarang.Hmm...for the first time in history,my Saturday night was spend at home,sleeping reading and eating. My friends did ask me out...tapi macam malas gitu.Yesterday,I was at school sampai 6.30pm,doing my marking.My family went to johor,I was asleep when they came back. Today,I intend to do some shopping to ease the pain...hehehe,berjiwang gitukan.Recently,the weather seems unpredictable.Still,listening to risalah hati.Ni lagu dewa juga, beautiful words,hayati....   Bayang-bayang   Saat kuterlena  Dalam buaian mimpi  Kucoba 'tuk menghalau  Rasa cinta yang pernah ada   Semakin kuterbawa  Oleh pesona dirimu  Saat kuterjaga dalam khayalan semu  Kucoba 'tuk meraih  Angan yang mengusik mimpiku  Tapi ku tak berdaya   Bayang-bayangmu kasih  Selalu hadir dalam gelisahku  Nada-nada asmara  Kan terhilang sekilas kau ada  Bayang-bayangmu kasih  Mewarnai asa dalam duka  Nada-nada asmara  Kan terhilang sekejap kau lepas   Saat ku terbayang  Wajah anggun angkuhmu  Kucoba 'ntuk menjauh  Saat - saat dekat denganmu  Melupakan dirimu  Bayang-bayang slalu ada  Ketika kupejamkan mataku   During my secondary school days,I used to feel that those who listen to love songs (jiwang2) are pathetic,losers in life.Look at me now...Im a freak,hehehe... A few days ago,did bermsn with someone. The conversation was distant at first,then everything was smooth.He made me remember things that I had forgoten,the phrases that I luv to used,the first time we went out together.Ceritanya gini...we went to pizza hut,he uses fork n spoon bila makan pizza,saya pun kekekanlah...memories.I think it was an embarassing moment for him.He came into my life too early...my mind and emotions were unstable then.I was sarcastic,hot-tempered and defensive.Perhaps... he is the one that got away... perhaps. : )

      things are being laid out on the table and need immiediate actions. Things to buy such as tapes,red pen,A4 size paper...alas my laziness overtook my determination to prepare for tommorow's class.Therefore here I am, typing without a care in the world.There's art class tommorow,did designing with my other P6 class last week,what to prepare for tommorow...its still a long way to go.Being the teacher in-charge of Dikir Barat, I need to prepare the posters and booth for tommorow's CCA promotion day. The musical inclined..the future rebanist player,the juara,karut...need to get a P3 student.  This friday,Im on a date wif a friend.He need someone to talk to,been rejecting him for a while now.Still,we are frenz,juz not my cup of coffee or tea...walau hansome gile,lacking somewhere,the sparks or ribena sparkle are just not there.hehehe. Change my focus from Dewa to Anuar Zain...the song Mungkin,very nicely composed.Oasis...ehhehe,  Don't Go Away  Cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say  About the things caught in my mind  And as the day was dawning my plane flew away  With all the things caught in my mind  (bridge)   So don't go away, say what you say  But say that you'll stay  Forever and a day...in the time of my life  Cos I need more time, yes I need more time  Just to make things right   So don't go away, say what you say  But say that you'll stay  Forever and a day...in the time of my life  Cos I need more time, yes I need more time  Just to make things right   Me and you what's going on?  All we seem to know is how to show  The feelings that are wrong   (chorus)`  So don't go away, say what you say  But say that you'll stay  Forever and a day...in the time of my life  Cos I need more time, yes I need more time  Just to make things right   there's this other song that I adore, Ghazal Untuk Rabiah,kind of inspirational,luv the music ...everything... as a whole package,dan yang penting ada nilai sejarah.  Ghazal Untuk Rabiah.  Kilauan intan berkelip-kelip di langit tinggi Dan cahaya menari-nari di langit biru Tidaklah dapat menenangkan perasaanku Yang rindukan kehadiran kasih  Gemersik irama merdu buluh perindu Dan nyanyian pari-pari dari kayangan Tidaklah dapat tenteramkan sanubari Yang mendambakan kepastian kasihmu   Songs,cannot live without them,same goes with colours...a form of expression, a beautiful tool.

      hari ini...dalam bahasa Melayu pula... Semalam keluar dengan seorang teman.Semalam hati saya tak tenteram. Bila saya lihat balik apa yang telah saya lakukan selama ini, adakah ia betul ataupun tidak... ataupun perjuangan hidup yang saya hadapi selama ini merupakan sesuatu yang sesia belaka. Memang benar,ramai yang ingin menjatuhkan...dengan pandangan-pandangan mereka yang menusuk-nusuk kalbu...hmm,life. Kawan saya yang berkritikal thinking ni pun mengeluarkan pena dan kertas. Dia melukiskan bulatan-bulatan, Katanya,hidup kita macam ini, Kita jangan endahkan apa yang terdapat di dalam bulatan2 besar ni. Bulatan terbesar ini dapat disimbolkan sebagai persekitaran.Kita tak boleh ubah persekitaran. Bulatan yang mengiringinya merupakan persahabatan,pandangan orang/masyarakat dan sebagainya.Kita tak boleh ubah pandangan orang. Kita berada di bulatan ini,sambil menunjukkan saya bulatan yang paling kecil. ini ibarat diri kita, jangan pedulikan bulatan yang lain, fahami diri kita, percaya dengan kemampuan kita... kita dapat ubah diri kita...it was motivational.  Prinsip itu pernah saya pegang, tapi at one point of time in my life,the tendency to look back and say   shucks...should'nt do those things,it will only hurt others   regrets after regrets... tulah...  Saya berterima kasih kepada kawan saya yang seorang tu... yang dah heret saya ke Clementi,tukar chargernye... berbaloi disebabkan apa yang telah dia ilhamkan kepada saya malam tadi...terima kasih

      yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called " orang lama of the dikir barat world " together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.

           Dealing with alot of problems...can be a challenge. The latest one,Piala Tun Perak 2003,6 groups back out from the competition. After organizing a few competitions,this was the first time I encountered this problem...I was devastated.Hmm...everything went wrong,it started from the briefing,with the interference of the so-called friend,who marked up the prize money for tickets,registration money..for his individual selfish pathetic needs.I was so stupid,should have given him a tight smacking on the face...       Called up the judges,saying that this Sunday competition had been cancelled.   Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.  --Ralph Waldo Emerson     Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great ones make you feel that you too, can become great.  --Mark Twain    Kinda of motivational...

      been calculating the numbers of relationships that I had...hmm... Its funny when you have been here and there...everywhere.Your heart starts to ache and it makes you vommit remembering the evil deeds that you had commit.ehheheeh The thing is,its no use meeting someone new,when deep within...you know his not the one for you.Your mine starts to think and your heart starts to ache.Its more heart breaking when you know that the One...you want to spend your life with...does not share the same feelings for you.He was a...   person with who  everything was great, everything was perfect,  but the timing was just wrong. There was no fault in the person,  there was no flaw in the chemistry, but the cards  just didn't fall  the right way, I suppose.      For the first time, after a long,long time...I did have feelings or shall I say ribena sparkles for this guy.And for the first time,someone rejected me.(padan muka... gitukan,menusuk)Retribution...my dear Watson...retribution. eheheh. known him by the name back then,around three years ago.My friend or so-called brother kept babbling about him...good things.Its only recently that I got to know him.Therefore,this lyric down here,is a rough idea how I felt about him,minus the  ratu  part,hmmm....  Exists Rahsia Pohon Cemara  Berkurun lama kurahsiakan Cintaku padamu Hanya kerna kau ratu laksana Di singgahsana  Di tasik ini, di pohon cemara Yang teguh meninggi Bagai harapan ku kepadamu Sekian lama  1 Akan kuserah cinta abadi Menyerlah sinar malam sepimu Agar menjadi penawar lukamu Warna hatimu  Akan kubawa kau mengembara Menerokai alam asmara Mengubu kota Cinta kita  Genggam erat jajiku Sematkan di dalam hatimu Moga cinta makin mekar Mengharumkan hidupmu  In life you have to pick up the pieces and move on.For me,its not easy to have feelings for a certain someone...then again if I were to fall for one,I forsake everything...hmm not quite everything,that you would be Salina in A.Samad Said's novel.

      In a few hours time, another briefing for Piala Tun Perak,what can I say,organising competitions does build up my confidence.Another hectic day,tommorow is the briefing for Malam Anugerah Dikir.Been listening to Oasis,beautiful, meaningful words.It makes them unique,their lyrics and music are simply superb. I have read a essay written by a friend of mine...hmm,beautiful. Been cleaning up my room,when i found this book called  Perempuan di titik Nol , maybe I bought it when I was in Jakarta.Never have the time to read it...never have the time to watch T.V...never,physically exhausted...then again I enjoy the things that I am doing.  I remembered the other day, I was really pissed off by this so called Cikgu,in-charge of one of the I.T.E,telling me off,saying that my competitions is not well organised and so on and so forth.Saya pun apa lagik,I blew him off,telling him straight that we as the organisers have the full authority to extend the dates for the competition.Its due to circumstances that these things happened.By the way,I did call the school representatives.Suara saya dahlah lantangkan... So what if you are the cikgu,no basic moral ethics,don't jolly well deserved to be called one. Thinking,that the one he is speaking to a so-called uneducated,moron.I do not like people to acknowledge me as Cikgu,macam janggal gitu,ilmu belum melangit. When people pushed me too far,then thats it...full strength sarcasm will start to mutiply and burst straight to the opponent's face.hmm...lepas tu baru dia eksyen berbual baik dengan saya...wat a disgrace to a society and our children.

      Got to know a certain someone.A beautiful friend,totally different from the circle of friends Im having right now. He doesn't act nor does he know anything about writing. A strong character,his perspective in life,in a way or another reflects mine.Humble. There's something about him that I couldn't put my fingers into.  An Aquarius...just like my dear sister.

      Kinda of sleepy,then again these eyes of mine cannot shut themselves up.This is due to the pumping of blood to the brain which inhales the surroundings and therefore unthinkable questions emerges before the dead cell eyes.Almost two,I do not know what woke me up...I feel uncomfortable,did my facial cleansing a while ago.hmm...life the ups and downs and the haziness of mood swings.Maybe should sing to myself...macam tak betul gitukan...ehhehehe.Oklah...got to sleep,if not no energy to teach and mould the so called our future,heart breaking,sweet.pure innocent and at the same time defiant, little misfits.Phase in life......

My bedroom is in a mess,due to my laziness or the no.of hours I spend at home.Hate going back home,especially when no one is around.Miss my mum...she has been busy at the stall,and my dad too. These few days,been eating out... At times,how I wish,I could spend my time reading or just basically watching T.V...my own sweet private time alone.Miss my family. : ( hmm...the least Im doing right now is squeezing time for my blog spot.

      this week had been a busy week,then again its how you take it. Life is not a game...we are not in a race track whereby we have to take that kinda risk,its not a competition,its more of a soul searching journey...a long one. A decision making tingy.The right choice would make you feel right all the way...whereby, wrong choices are meant to learnt. Not to be repeated again...well I do repeat them especially if its due to the aching heart.Hmm...my brain cell would automatically shut down,and my heart takes control.eheheh.... To me,I had enough challenges... to be where I am right now,not bragging...or being boastful.At times,tired of people having high expectations of me.Afterall,I do make mistakes...lots and tonnes of it.  beautiful lyrics by Oasis...reflects on my life journey  They're trying hard to put me in my place And that is why I've gotta keep running The future is mine and it's no disgrace Cos in the end the past means nothing   You tell me I'm free then you tie me down And from my chains I think it's a pity What did it cost you to wear my crown You dont like me why don't you admit it   D'you feel a little down today? Bet you ain't got much to say? But your gonna miss me when I'm not there You know I dont care, You know I dont care   As we beg and steal and borrow Life is hit and miss and this I Hope, I Think, I Know And if I hear the names you call If I stumble catch me when I fall Cos baby after all, You'll never forget my name

      Pencarian menyeberangi beribu destinasi capai ketetapan harga diri lalu dihitung berulang kali ditambah,diubah,  jawapannya tetap sama...  melenyapkan teka-teki sentuhan kata-kata Jawi berterbangan menghanyutkan diri ini hatta ia berulang lagi pencarian ini... menemukan makna erti.  Hari ni terciptalah sebuah puisi...hati ini mula tidak tenang kembali, rumit kekadang hidup ini,merumitkan... Im hurting and bleeding so much,can't see wound thou,I can only feel the pain. Malam anugerah dikir is this week,hmm...not mentally prepared,emotionaly unstable..because of my dear cat...who was knocked down... : (

      what a beautiful day to begin with,although my lesson plan is only half way done. Blogspot...its where you reveal your deepest feelings and thoughts for the day.My sajak came out for Berita Harian last week..quite proud of it... then again,my poems are my thoughts...deepest thought. Malam Anugerah Dikir...its over at last. Beautiful Night... gave that special award to Zaidy Nandir. I was happy that he liked it. Objective was fufilled, to show to a certain someone that...me being in Gabungan does make a difference.: ) self satisfaction. Tired...Im going out of that organisation, concentrate more on the MAEC and my own time alone. A fren was giggling away about my blogspot,where I had pasted Exist's lyrics...quite embarrassing,then again,hmmm...to me the past doesn't play a big impact,saya bukan yang selalu berjiwa retak. Life is a jigsaw puzzle,you have to have all the pieces,to be who you are today,itulah pendapat saya.  Beautiful songs by Frente...the tuning of the guitar was superb,the whole package tingy...  Every time i think of you I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue It's no problem of mine but it's a problem i find Living a life that i can't leave behind There's no sense in telling me The wisdom of a fool won't set you free But that's the way that it goes And it's what nobody knows And every day my confusion grows Every time i see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I'm waiting for that final moment You'll say the words that i can't say  I feel fine and i feel good   I feel like i never should Whenever i get this way, i just don't know what to say Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday I'm not sure what this could mean I don't think you're what you seem I do admit to myself That if i hurt someone else Then we'd never see just what we're meant to be Every time i see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I'm waiting for that final moment You'll say the words that i can't say

      hmm...did some soul searching,just now... hmm...true, Im guilty of following my intuition.......mistakes which put me in a remorseful state while most of them did...make me realise that Im proud of making those mistakes , its a learning journey thingy...experiences are meant to be learnt. Did some searching on the word " intuition" , this definition strikes me (macam banyak masa kan kat sekolah)...ehheh  " Intuition is processed unconsciously. As a result, it has been reduced to a myth and allowed to sink into the province of mystics and fringe groups. Nevertheless, the descent of intuition from prehistory as a means of surviving changes and predators and finding ways to deal with enemies ensures that it is still the intelligence of everyday life. Human relationships, especially child-rearing, matching oneself to a mate and a job-these are the chief provinces of intuition. In its wholeness, intuition is the form of intelligence that includes our social sense.."  Basically what Im trying to say here is after yesterday's event,Ive had it until here. Im retiring from the dikir barat scene...too many masks or should I say topeng to handle...Art is a beautiful thing,its a form of expression...then again the people in it...just kills away my passion.  I shall remember a certain person or indvidual who had stabbed me again and again...hurting me tremendously . True, you can forgive but never to forget. Thus, I shall not forget what he told me the otherday...until the day I die...maybe not even to forgive.  Im getting out of the MAEC Siglap South CC. Im getting out of Gabungan. Im tired...too tired.  Cradel   ( Sanubari )    Tak tersentuhkah sanubarimu melihat curahan airmataku tak terlihatkah redup mataku mohon pengertian relakan aku terus berpautan tiada gunanya kerana kerelaanku terbunuh sudah kering gersang tasik cinta biar tengkujuh tiada alirannya  kembalikan aku pada kasihku usah kau ragut cintaku yang satu izinkan dia miliki kedua  dan terakhir kalinya...  hmmm....i wrote another sajak... hayatilah x 3  Perjuangan nan sepi... lalu yang tertindas dan ditindas adalah kita... Dan yang ditumpas dan tertumpas adalah kaca-kaca airmata... Penyesalan ini... dan beribu penyesalan lagi. - hafidah mahat

      Life has been peaceful now.  Doing the things that I do right now...everything is so colourful. yup... To look at things that Ive done...hmm overwhelming. Maybe if you have fallen fo a certain someone that you really like...it brings butterflies to your stomach. You are afraid of rejection and therefore your feelings for him are deeply secured.For the first time, Ive learnt to be more bermaruah... Yup...its the different approach,the way he looks at you just makes you look down and glitter. For the first time, Im afraid of having an eye contact...hehheh (macam nak muntahkan) Forgetting all the past experiences...just by the flick of the fingertips.

      Refuge and strength, hmmm...had a tough day yesterday,instilling fear in the hearts of my dikir barat boys. True...I was emotionally traumatised by their attitude. Attitude my dear...the phase of life that they are encountering right now,adapting to peer pressure, the attention seekers, all add up to the burning sensation that I encounter which breaks my heart into two.  To dwell on it, will only make me look older than my age, I will start to wrinkle before I turn 25. Problems after problems...not forgetting the parents. That the worse thing,meeting parents, telling them that their children did not do well for his/her exam or the child loves to cry his/her hearts out when Im not around or they show signs of defiant at the age of 8. Alas...what can I say. My students...are my reflections.I love each and every single one of them as if they were my own...hmm guess what, i think Ive bonded with my 6EM3 students. As i look at them, no matter how big they are, I can still see sparkles in their eyes...and I know in one way or another they appreciate me as well, in their own way. : )  Though we search the world over for the beautiful, we find it within or we find it not.

      "Fitnah merupakan sesuatu yang menyakitkan...ia boleh menghancurkan seseorang individu yang tertentu... I had the shock of my life after reading a certain something from my dikir barat guessbook, more kind of the shock of the century, The certain someone, which I think i knew said, dari  kelana ke andika lepas tu keponakan dan sekarang kelana kembali...  Yup,thats it...my love life story which is ...at a certain extent untrue. Think of it...how famous Ive become...heheeheh To wear the same colour with that kelana guy...wat his name?yup...whatever, doesn't mean that Im with him,right? Rumours...some things are better left unsaid.  Now...Im quite happy with a certain someone,sweet and understanding.No nuts about dikir barat and we purely talk about life and work. The other day he came all the way from Jurong to my school for cultural night...there was also this one time that he rushed to Bedok after his meeting from Redhill and then he went back to Jurong to his camp. sweet huh?  This 26 year old aquarius guy is very sweet...Im bless to know him. True...you have to know a lot of people...which I terribly did, to really find the One...and guess what, the approach is different too...

      " support me dear,through this path that I'm about to choose" hmm...the words that I told him.Yup...sure to encounter lots of hiccups along the way, and I shall fall tumbling down again but this time around its different...there's someone special out there to hold me tight...with lots and lots of bubbly love.ehhheh.... Ive had enough rest after the Tun Perak 2004. Im now energised for another project. This time around,its purely because of the love for a certain someone as he believe in me...hehheeheh.  My sis and I are helping Rosley for Mega Perdana 2004, we had been alot together,I mean me and my sis,the road that we choose are...somewhat similar...we fall and pick each other up..the moment we are slipping.Its when things goes wrong that we mustn't quit.

      Hmm...my heart n soui went to Taiwan last Thursday,on the 1st to be precise. Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said " In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you," I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004

      After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words..." We wont be in the CC, without you guys around," hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants...  Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   	"Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  	--Wolfman Jack Smith

      The beauty of silence...  Today Saturday, Im suppose too be in NIE to hand in the assignment and NUS with my frens for the theatre tingy but the weather was so hot and HUMID that we decided not to go.Guess what ...Im taking my degree,my part time degree that is.It will be commencing this June. Yup... Ive decided Singapore, Im going for my degree course which will be held at SIM. We,my sis and I have promised to work hard and be disciplined in our work. Yeah right...last minute assignment.  : )

          Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, " Do you know that .....in your CC," I said " Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu," The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.    Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...

      hmm...life has taken a way of its own. Things that you never expect to happen just happen. Yesterday, I went out to meet a friend. He was sweet and I never imagine that a simple dinner that we had... made me reflect into something much more deeper. Life...some say just go with the flow...  " What makes you wanting to have dinner with me? " I asked.  " Im missing something..." he said. Silence. Juz when I thought, I was going to move on. Juz when I thought, some hurtful words are just unbearable to swallow... Deep within,uncertainty lurkes in every corner. I looked at him and smile...he was sincere. " Im an egoistic person," he said. " I know..." I replied .

Proud of Durbars n my lirik....ehehheeheh walaupun tak dapat lirik terbaik...I will work on it...because of my rima... Juara :  Ya Mujahiddin...hunuskan berbilah kasihnya, Impikanlah cinta atas resah, dunia ketiga, Ya suara...panglima bersaudara, Merkahkan, merahkan tanah, tumpahnya darah.  Tatkala malam menyingsing tiba, Tatkala airmata meragut maruah, *(Ya mujahiddin la tyasu   fi juhudikum Lil Islama dina) Tatkala itu berpedang puaka. Tatkala dendam bayangan wajah,  Aduhai bulan teraju semesta, Dendangkan irama lagu panglima, **(Alaikum bilkuwah watamasaku  biizzati lufusikum liwatanikum mahbubah) Biar perjuangan berpetakan cahaya, Gegarkan kesunyian lautan leka.    *Wahai mujahiddin jangan berputus asa dalam perjuangan kamu untuk agama islam    **Lengkapilah dgn kekuatan demi mempertahankan harga diri demi tanahair tercinta     sang by Elfie Ismail...heheehhe

      These few days has been tiring due to the humid wheather. I was perspiring in class. Yesterday, I scolded a P2 student,  " Kalau awak taknak belajar lagi...senang,saya hantar awak kat guru-guru lain. Jangan masuk dalam ke kelas saya...tak payah sakitkan hati saya." He cried his heart out...tersedu-sedan. I was shock as this student of mine is a hard core individual, all this while I was lenient, he sits and does his work next to me. But I manage to wipe his tears away.Yesterday...dats it...I blew up. heheheheh....berdosa saya.. A fren of mine, once said, " budak-budak ni,wali-wali kecil...doa mereka selalu menjadi.." My life..my love life had been beautiful. Alas...I can rest now. The other night, he asked me to accompany him to dinner. One of the dikir fren from Usrah Dewa by the name of Fadili. So I asked him, so we wear the same colour... I was thinking of red...then again, it doesn't matter as i will buy the same colour as his..ehheeh.

         Hmm...my blogspot...where I share my deepest worries and at the same time ambition. My dear officer cheated on me. Yup. I used the word cheated. He is married. Yup, don't believe it but my dear sis saw it...and that is the conclusion,no wonder he wanted to take things slow.Therefore, she saw him after I met my dream guy.   Anyway, luckily I choose my Shariff or should I say that the Kelana guy came in my life at the right time. 3 days before he came back from Taiwan, Ive already made up my mind to be with Shariff Sah...eheheh.Its true ... if it is meant to be, then it will be.   How many times I tried to forget him, again and again memories with him will always emerged beneath my desperate soul. I tried all means to forget and hate him...very difficult. Shariff here, is a Taurus,  traditional Taurus Traits Patient and reliable Warmhearted and loving Persistent and determined Placid and security loving  On the dark side....  Jealous and possessive Resentful and inflexible Self-indulgent and greedy

      I was surfing, when I saw an article on one of the websites...saying that Dikir barat is a no good influential tingy... so being a kepo person...I replied...  Dikir Barat A Waste of Time…  “ I wept because I have no shoes….until I meet a man with no feet. – anonymous “  Dikir Barat is an art form, an expression of the mind and at the same time the soul. Based on the few drop of experiences, it is sad to see someone concluding that “  dikir barat is like poison to the Malay society - Irfan Kasban”. We should judge problems or matter arising from different angles and perspectives. Stereotyping on a certain issue will only make the picture hazy and therefore the conclusion would be devastating. To look at our society and to pinpoint that dikir barat is the caused to all the injustice that is happening in the Malay society is another grave mistake. 	The youngsters are becoming what they are today is not due to dikir barat but another bigger picture which is the family unit. Everything has to be nurture within the family unit itself. The role modelling of parents which does play an important role especially when money is always the main agenda when living our life as Singaporeans. Parents have no time for their children and thinking that money can replace any form of communication between a mother and a child. Thus, children are being brought up without instilling ethics and moral value, which is the foundation of any great society. 	To the younger brother Irfan, this you have to realise that wearing a hijab is important for a muslimah. Then again, to wear one and to sing on stage is an irony which must not be blend together. I shall no touch on these much further.  “Janji Melayu”, every group has this problem. It is not only in dikir barat, shall I say it in general that it intersects our everyday life. If we were to look into the history of the word Janji Melayu, I have to search for my Sejarah Melayu and ask all the great philosophers, which could take years. Then again, in looking at things we have to keep our mind clear and no stereotyping.      From my own judgement, without dikir barat the ethics of our youngster would be much worse that what it is portrayed today. Dikir barat teaches us the value of commitment, brotherhood, responsibility and being confident in what we believe in. From my personal view, dikir barat had taught me to believe in what I am capable of doing and to stand on my rights when the need arises. It teaches me to be confident. As a teacher, enriching my students about the beauty of dikirbarat and magical Malay language used in the lyrics is overwhelming. I am proud to say that once upon a time I used to be among those rowdy audiences in a dikir competition and experiences are things that last forever. To be passionate about this art form is not merely by writing it in poetry or repeating “I’m passionate about dikir barat “ again and again without realising the real meaning. To be passionate, is being able to commit and defend this beautiful culture of ours and to do that… we have to respect it first.   Hafidah Mahat.

      These few days had been hectic. Too many things to do...Mega Perdana,SA1, key in the marks, calling parents and the thing that I hate most... meeting the parents. I just don't like to meet them up, it is not that I had abused their children...it is just me...Im not the people-people kind of person, I just can't go to that person and ay Hi..hows everything or hmm...it takes time. Some of my frens say that it is a requirement... my job description, responsibility. With my students, its a different thing, you're part of them, you be them and at times you join them...no need to put on the mask...jus be ureself. With parents...you have to be extra nice, which I don't like doing...putting on the mask. Ive got to change thou...my stuck up face...its not thst I am arrogant, I know Ive got to change...loosen up a bit. Just the other day, I went out my guy and his frens. I was comfortable...but when they start making stupid jokes infront of me..then it started...deep within..I said. " Stupid x 6... " It really pissed me off at a certain point when his fren did gave  a sarcastic remark to one of the karut sitting at the same table as ours. I was a bit frustrated wen my dear add on to the sarcastic remarks... i understand that wen guys talk they can be harsh at times...but you can do that behind my back...not wen Im eating and hearing those harsh words in dismay. I don't know...maybe its just me...being the emotionally and sensitive creature...

      Create and destroy...ehhehehe Hmmm....a few days had pass but yet within those few days...a lot of changes had taken place. For the price of dignity, respect and again devouring each day with questions yet to be answered.Sometimes, things never change and it cannot be change because it is not meant to be change. Hmm...just realised that my relationship with him cannot work. Both of us are different, he is sarcastic,hot-tempered and an egoistic freak... which at times... i feel unbearable.He thinks that the world rotates around him. Respect has to be earned and my respect for him is lingering on the tip of my toe. I hate him...hate...hate just hate him... I used to think that I was the cause for the earlier break-uo, which I initiate by just emailing my thoughts and feelings. This time around, I sms him, which was short,sweet and rude I don't care. I don't really care what people feel or say about me. I do what I think is right. People who makes you feel that you're not special,aren't worth your time. These breed of people just pull you down flat to the ground...

          Tremendous effort...in making the competition a success.Tired but nevertheless we're satisfied.Starting from the stage decor which I did and plan on my own ..eheheh.. to the drama part which we did as team. With the Kelanas in our CC, it was a great...everything was spic and span within minutes.We had no problems in figuring who will help us in shifting the platform,arranging the chairs and whatsoever not...they were a great help compared to other groups who used to be in our C.C. Everything followed as planned.    Hmm,my love life has undergo a big change.Meet someone I like, very sweet and the chemistry just flow. I hope that this time around it will work,I really hope so. At one point, Im too tired in getting to know people because you're afraid that you will get hurt...its a yucky feeling. You will feel disheartened and you feel really flat.Its not a good feeling especially when Im teaching.Nevertheless, this beautiful person that I've met is very sweet,funny and active, totally the opposite of me.But we do share some things in common.And the most important thing is that he is supportive...that's why I fall for him.His guys really respect him and I could see it in their eyes.There's a saying that goes," Know the guy through his friends and the girl through her family..." Respect has to be earn and he has just earn mine.Luv him though.    Yesterday,my sis and I went to watch two movies in a row. The first was Harry Potter and later that evening we had The Day After Tommorow...Hmm...we did enjoy the movies until both of us suffered backache the next morning...

      Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...

Seriously,Im confused, unable to accept the underlyning fact that hatred and conquest have to be shared.Hmm...over here, people are too afraid to stand on what they believe in . In time, we have to understand that life is a beautiful thing. It comprises of different factors which affect the way we think and feel.How complicated...

Being the rebellious, so-called Robin Hood, intending to save the millions who suffered under the dictatorship of a leader...in the end...hmm..I just don't get it. When I was in NIE, a lecturer told us,   " Cikgu2 ingat, nanti kat sekolah,cikgu2 jumpa bermacam-macam jenis manusia. Masa tu Cikgu kena ingat, Cikgu buat ini semua kerana budak-budak. Ikhlas,tiada niat-niat lain.." True,everything is for the students, there was never a doubt.Then again if people push too far, at times we have to stand for our rights...even if we're not sure of the consequences.Basically, I don't really care.   Yesterday, there was a blackout, the entire neighbourhood was affected. I was quite happy, no electricity...macam kampung...I can see the stars...

      KHAS BUAT MU YG TERISTIMEWA, HAFIDAHKU SAYANG.   Mengalah bukan beerti kalah.. Berundur bukan beerti kendur... Tapi ianya sekadar tunduk berarah dan tawadhuk bersyukur...   Berdetum guruh dilangit, bumi tak hancur sebelum kiamat.. Selagi matahari tak sejengkal jari, kita masih dihitung hari... Begitulah adanya aku, sebelum kau dan sesudah dia..   Kehadiranmu tidak ku duga.. Kemunculanmu tidak disangka... Bagaikan pelita penuh bercahaya... Menerangi jalanku yg gelap gelita...     Munculnya kau insan yg istimewa.. Menjernihkan jiwa ku yg penuh bergelora..    Aku yg dulu hanyut terdampar menderita.. Kembali berdiri di bumi yg nyata... Aku bersyukur dan aku redha...   Akan ku layarkan semula.. Bahteraku yg hanyut di lautan masa.. Dampingilah daku dekatilah aku Seorg nakhoda bukan pendita... Bersama-samalah kita mengharunginya..   Susurilah dibelakangku supaya aku menjadi khalifah.. Dampingilah disebelahku biar aku menjadi teman hidup setia.. Berbicaralah dihadapanku agar aku menjadi pengawalmu senantiasa..  Dan bermanjalah disisiku supaya aku menjadi suami yg penyayang setiap masa...  Insya Allah....   Terima kasih diatas kehadiranmu dlm hidupku.....   Daripada Hanip Haron

      hmm...did manage to make a decision about something. I intend to further my studies to UM,3 years . Im excited. At last,Im going back to sastera and meeting all the lecturers there. Hmm...kinda cool. Then again, I have to leave all the beautiful people here. My family, friends and my beloved Mr Hanip Haron. Yesterday, I saw something that I should'nt see. Tears coming out from someone that I really care. Yup...world...she cried. Due the fact that&nbsp;a certain&nbsp;pathetic son of the  urlLink %%#*$% &nbsp;doesn't appreaciate. It did send some worries...and the worst part of all she will not be with me for this Sunday competition. I was kinda taken aback. The tears...hmm...it did leave an everlasting impact. Okay...enough of that. I think I have fallen&nbsp;in love and I mean deep. Sigh... Life is a complete mystery and it is up to us to make it complete.  I think I love you... So wat am I afraid of...  Retak berderai jiwa hamba...hahahha...very funny.

      Im feeling the stress to fuffil the ambition of the kings and the queens. Too many things to do and I hate the feeling of not knowing to do what first. Let me keep my mind focus and try to finalise what are the things that Im suppose to do.    Mega Perdana     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many to be done such as - things from decorations to emcee to stage to even the mere responsibility of printing the tickets. Im so tired, although the job is divided into two, that is with me and my sis, im still nagging. For goodness sake, the people in Gabungan are expecting us to do all these things.&nbsp;And worse of all, at the end of the day, the old&nbsp;undiposable&nbsp;Cikgu Hussein will&nbsp;say that we had not&nbsp;done the job properly. I don't care.  To think at it, if Im so-called passionate about this art form..  then why on earth, am I nagging ?  Hmm... at times even the strongest warrior need a rest .&nbsp; warrior seh : )&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, for this semi-final, Im going to make it a memorable one. Underlyning the fact that I have no idea what to decorate&nbsp;, what to do acara selingan and so&nbsp;on and so forth. Everything has to done from scratch.&nbsp;    Siglap South Community Centre    Centre of The Performing Arts     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yeah...the performing arts and we're the centre of it. Need to write letters to schools, they're having this tarian event which again I have no nuts about. Nevertheless, Im exhausted, in trying to make ends meet. Starting from the&nbsp;letters until the pathetic part as drawing up the budget.    Fengshan Primary School     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hmm...heartache. Especially with my P6EM3s. They are making my life difficult. I can't bear to meet them. Rude to the max. Maybe its retribution.   &nbsp;  I think I having this disease whereby I tend to nag a lot. I mean tremendously. Mr Hanip said that seeing me nagging&nbsp; is a cute thing ( yup, everything is beautiful if you're in love, wait until Im with him 10 long yrs down the road) ...and I sincerely thinking of&nbsp;getting my head fixed.    watch your thoughts; they become words    watch your words; they become action    watch your actions; they become habits    watch your habits; they become character    watch your character; they become destiny     &nbsp;   - Frank Outlaw     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   " Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year..."  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... " the person can be me or you..." it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai

      Mega Perdana semi final , this year was kinda of chaotic. Hmm...it chaotic everytime but this year, its a diiferent story. Interesting, we were the hot fire cracking organiser running here and there to make sure everything was perfect. To add up to our stress   a group   lost their valuables and we end up catching the culprit. So proud of my students...loud but yet Im proud of them. The culprit was within the group which had reported their things missing. We were quite happy that we caught the culprit. The introduction did not turn out that well due to the sound system. Durbar - 1st Kelana Purba - 2nd Keris - 3rd  the placing was well deserved, they really did their best.
