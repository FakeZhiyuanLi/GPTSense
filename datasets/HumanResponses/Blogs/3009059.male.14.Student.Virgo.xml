      In recent hours, class 9B visited the portfolio exhibiton. "I saw it with my own eyes!  His name was right there!" Dimas said, who was a eyewitness of what the hell happened.  What the hell happened?  Well okay. "We were suppose to comment on the gr. 6 and 7's portfolio's.  I passed Sir T's well developed embryo, and she told me to sign her's.  I signed it, 'cause I pitied for her.  I saw her signing paper, right smack on top of the paper...was the name...DARIUS!  I screamed, and screamed, as horror stabs through me.  A chill ran down my spine, and my pupil enlarged 2.4 X as it was to receive more light than ever...it was scary!  I backed down a few steps...and ran as fast as I could!  But I came back, because my class was still in there and I forgot to sign Hannah's portfolio."  Dimas, who was panic-stricken wrote "Darius first...hmm interesting...".  I myself did not witness such a crime.  But I do believe, or in Darius' words, "very cool", that there is something.  Oh yeah and I have to add something.  Hannah, if you're reading this...my comment said "nice effort"...well what I meant was the the 12.18 thing...ya know not that I'm saying that you put an effort and it's not good...I'M NOT SAYING THAT!  I'm just saying that...you put a lot of effort kinda thing.  You know!  We wish you all portfolioers to have good grades, and I hope that you guys hope we have great exam grades. -And I'm spent.

      I will talk in codes for now.  E3 likes Pyassm.  Pyassm likes E3, very basic and simple.  I can even make a song right now.  He was a boy She was a girl Can I make it anymore obvious? He spikes his hair She doesn't care What more can I say He wanted her  She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well  So all of her friends Said why not BUT SHE THINKS HE'S HAIRRRRRRYYYYYYYY  I'm not naming names ya know.  And the song goes on and on.  Yeah so, today, in English class, we had time to do some free work.  E3 dragged a pillow, and placed it on a desk, and so did Pyassm.  Together they cuddled, listening to My Band.  This also shows that they are not romantic.  The rest of the class gave them privacy, moving to the north side of the class.  We wish E3 and Pyassm a good life.

      I've been waiting to play in this game for 3 years.  FINE, 1 year.  OK so I finally got in!  But it wasn't a good game.  We lost by 7, and I had the chance to score 2 free shots.  Ain't my fault!  Those 2 freeshots were my first one on the line.  Right now I just wanna re live the scene.  It just aint perfect enough...maybe some other time.  Oh and Carroll also kneed me in the guts.  I wud swear right now, but I can't cuz reports arent out yet!  Final Score: 22-15

      Subject Ivan Kong, is easily turned on!  Just by bringing subject Fiona Tanniel in the radius of 4 meters.  Every single time Ivan goes near Tanniel, he will always say it's hot.  He denies the fact that Tanniel turns him on, and always says that Tanniel is one of the solar system members, the sun.  I think, Ivan is nuts.  You know what, I believe Ivan is nuts.  Ivan is an annoying fucking bastard.  But as stated, Ivan always goes hot near Tanniel.  Since October 2k3, we already know that Ivan was attracted to subject Fiona Tanniel, for attempting to ask her to watch  The Rundown , by Dwayne Johnson.  We never knew though, subject Ivan was HOT near object Fiona.  This is a very erotic school story, and must be further researched based on observations in upcoming weeks.

      Sir Townley dislikes his fine student, Darius Teng.  The following reasons are for being attracted to Sir Townley's well developed embryo.  On the 21st of May, R.Kelly visited Non-south Capital of Indonesia International School, to sing "I Believe I can Fly" for the special end of year NJIS dance.  Darius Teng who was acting very much like a  Gallus domesticus , rushed outside of the dancing room, and started running away.  In his own mind, he probably was thinking of dancing with Sir Townley's well developed embryo.  Teng, was forced to dance by his cool best friend, Hans Lesmana, but he refused.  Dimas Hendarto, his other non-social climber friend, was sitting at his house playing his black box.  This has nothing to do with the fact of Sir Townley disliking Darius Teng.  As I was saying, Darius was pulling his sweaty hands of the strong grips of Hans Lesmana.  Lesmana asked for reinforcements from his very influencing friend, Taslim.  Taslim asked Sir Townley's well developed embryo to come with her, and dance with Teng.  Teng still refuses, a funny creature that he is.  Teng finally followed his logics, having the greatest 2 minutes of his life.  And dat's why Sir T hates TEngu
