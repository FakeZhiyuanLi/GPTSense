      So my school's library is sooooo cold!  I had to bring a wool turtleneck sweater and winter socks today...so I can actually stand to stay here for more than half an hour.  Yikes!  I'm all bundled up and still cold. The cutest thing was in my apartment this morning.  I go under my desk to unplug my laptop and there's a little baby lizard (well, at least that's what I called it).  I quick got my camera and took pictures.  But it's tough to get a quality picture of something so small -- only about 1.5 inches from head to tip of tail!  So, if anyone who knows me is interested in seeing the pictures, let me know and I'll send you an email.

      The above link SHOULD take you to an article, but I never trust that links are really going to work. This will be a very quick and dirty discussion of the article...I found myself commenting to myself a lot while reading it, so just thought I'd share a bit. The article begins, "Florida may not spend taxpayer dollars to send children to religious schools, a state appeals court ruled Monday, dealing another blow to Gov. Jeb Bush's voucher program...the Opportunity Scholarship Program violates a section of the Florida Constitution that bars public money from going to religious institutions" (Beth Kormanik and J. Taylor Rushing, Strike 2 against school vouchers, Fl. Times Union, August 16, 2004, at A1).  The voucher program allows students at failing schools (as determined by the State and probably under the guidelines from the No Child Left Behind Act) to use vouchers to attend private schools, both religious and non-religious.  Should such public schoolchildren choose a religious school, the school is not allowed to force them to "pray, worship or accept their beliefs" (id.). This particular rule leads to my first thought.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose and/or mission of, let's say, Christian schools??  I'm most familiar with christian schools, so I'll stick to talking about them.  I think that the main reason parents send their children to christian schools is to put them in an educational environment both where their beliefs are nurtured and where worship and prayer with classmates is encouraged.  Doesn't this make the school more like a secular or non-religious private school?  Will parents of "paying" students, then, be inclined to remove their children from the christian schools?  Aren't they paying the high tuition rates so that their children can go to school with other children from similar moral backgrounds? The coalition of groups originally filed this lawsuit back in 1999 based on the fact "that the vouchers program is unconstitutional and that it strips public schools of students and much-needed money" (id.).  One Florida christian school was actually the center of a scandal for accepting vouchers for students who no longer attended there.  The public school system can not afford to lose money this way. Apparently, the U.S. Constitution does not bar the use of vouchers in religious schools, however the Florida Constitution is more specific and says that "tax dollars shall not 'be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution'" (id., at A-4).  In this respect, I guess I'm a little confused about different partisan views.  It's my understanding that, in general, the republican party resists any sort of government control.  It's also my understanding that most christians are affiliated with the republican party.  I may be off my rocker here, but why would these same groups want to promote any sort of gov't regulation in the schools (i.e., prayer in public schools).  It leads me to believe that they generally resist gov't control and/or gov't programs, except when it's to their benefit.  I hope this post makes some sense.  I recognize that I may be mistaken about some of this; but I have to keep it short, as I can't spend all day trying to sort something like this out.  Gotta get back to my schoolwork ASAP!!!

      A quick morning post here...  Last day of Orientation today, and only a half day!!  :) I was thinking about taking a book or two to the beach afterwards, but I don't think the weather will support that idea.  Oh well.  I'll get more accomplished if I stay inside anyway.  I was reading an interesting article in the local paper -- it's about "school vouchers."  Just more evidence that the education system, especially in terms of policy, will be everchanging and always interesting.  More on that later...  Mom/Sister -- Thanks so much for knowing what's best for me in terms of the cable/high-speed internet!  I'm really using it a lot and I know that all the legal research I have ahead of me will make it more than worthwhile.  Love you guys, and miss you dearly!  XOXOX

      Off to Orientation Day 2, along with 33.3% of my freaky fellow 1Ls.  I mean that in the nicest of ways.  It's actually a very large class.  It's hard to imagine that my Orientation group times three is even gonna FIT in that school! I'll try to get more rest tonight, mainly so this weblog doesn't get too stupid and rambly.  That tends to happen when I'm overtired.  A good workout (already got that overwith, yay!) and this coffee will definitely make the day easier. I hope everyone at home is doing well!  XOXOX

      I mentioned needing to get some sleep in my last post.  I tried to sleep, but it just wasn't in the cards.  So, I commented on the comments (see below) and now I just have 45 minutes to kill until the gym opens.  Then, I'll probably be drowning myself in coffee all day so I can stay awake. Why couldn't I sleep?  I dunno.  Maybe I'm more anxious than I would like to admit, but trust me, I won't admit that again after this.  Just not my style to show nerves, I guess. Or maybe the law school reading just has me sooooo excited I can't sleep a wink.  Maybe I should've just spent the entire night trying to decipher the Property case I'm supposed to read.  The case is actually a fossil, decided/published in 1823.  Did we even speak the same English back then??? I better quit while I'm ahead in this post.  Thanks to the commenters -- now anyone who reads this 'blog knows that I have one friend and my Mom.

      Well, I just finished doing my schoolwork for the night and I really need to get to bed, so this'll have to be short.  Orientation started today.  The lunch they provided was surprisingly nice and I met a couple potential friends.  I also got a fancy pen out of it! ;)  Some of the speakers were good, others were boring.  I didn't mind it, though, as it was a good test of my attention span.  Let's see, the topics ranged from the U.S. legal system to dealing with stress/nervous breakdowns to law students' propensity to develop drug and/or alcohol addictions.  Yeah, very uplifting.   The current tally of pages to be read for the first class meetings is ONLY 78.  So that's only for 2 out of my 5 classes, all of which will have reading assignments due for the first meetings.  We actually had reading and a case brief to do for tomorrow's orientation session.  It wasn't that much really, but I managed to spend a good solid 3.5 hours on it.

      I finally got my class schedule, therefore I was able to buy the rest of the required textbooks...another $422.00 later and I have all but 3 books now.  This reminds me of a funny post I read in another law student's weblog:  Friday, August 09, 2002 A quick comment on the book list I received in the mail along with my class schedule yesterday -- could they maybe give the textbooks more interesting names? Even if just to fool us? My contracts book is called "Contracts Cases and Doctrine." My Criminal Law book is called "Cases and Materials on Criminal Law." And most stimulating, my Civil Procedure book is called "Civil Procedure." I mean, I'm sure they're fine textbooks, and I have no illusion that the reading is going to be like a Dave Barry column. But if that Civil Procedure book was instead named, "The Crazy World of Civil Procedure," or "Civil Procedure for Debt-laden Law Students," or "Civil War -- I mean Procedure," maybe, just maybe, I'd look forward to buying the book. At least until I looked at the price tag. (No idea as of now what these books cost. But compared to tuition, the books -- heck, anything! -- is cheap.) posted by Jeremy @ 8:26 PM Â   My textbooks all have boring names as well...Problems in Contract Law:  Cases and Materials; Property;  Studies in American Tort Law;  Civil Procedure;  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;  Mastering Torts;  Contracts:  Examples and Explanations;  Lawyering:  Practice and Planning;  Basic Legal Research;  Writing and Analysis in the Law; and so on (~25 books total, some small and thin, others large and thick).  The most interesting textbook name I saw in the bookstore was "Contracting Law" -- it makes Law sound like some sort of disease.  And here's my schedule (mainly for you to see, Mom): Torts -- Mon./Wed.  11:30a-12:45p Property -- Mon./Wed.  3p-4:15p Civil Dispute Resolution -- Tue./Thu.  10:45a-12p Contracts -- Tue./Thu.  3:45p-5:40p Lawyering Process -- Tue./Thu.  6:15p-7:30p

      I'm actually watching the opening ceremonies right now...I'm just glad NBC didn't interrupt them with storm coverage! Still bracing myself for the storm, though. Guess it's supposed to come through here around 2 or 3 in the morning. I'm hoping that, for the sake of all those living north of here, the storm heads out to sea before it heads your way. I'm a little stressed out about it just because I don't want any tornadoes to touch down. It also stinks not knowing anyone around here. I've had a couple glasses of red wine, though, so I'm hoping that helps me get some sleep later. Uh oh, drinking alone already, and law school hasn't really even started yet. I heard a story from a friend who went to law school up in Baltimore. I guess they had a speaker at orientation who talked about lawyers and their tendency to become alcoholics. Just after the speaker finished (I guess it was the end of orientation week at that point), the students were told to go to the quad where there would be a few kegs and some dinner. Go figure. :) One more thing...I have to complain a bit about the fact that my textbooks cost around $800 or $900.  Can you believe it?  Not fun.

      I have to brag a bit, for purely selfish reasons, 'cause it helps keep me motivated.  I've already worked out for 100 minutes (30 lapswim, 30 cardio - elliptical, 40 upper body strength training, stretching and abs)!  Plus, I've had my shower, cleaned up my place and made coffee.  Woo hoo!  Wanted to get a good workout done before the hurricane forces me to stay inside.  Swimming at sunrise is so amazing...calm, peaceful, beautiful, quiet.  I just love it.  I feel so fortunate to have a nice pool and fitness center at my disposal any time of the day. Now I'm waiting for the cable person to come set up my TV and Internet.  That will also be so convenient to have.  I definitely wasn't planning on having such luxuries, but many, many thanks to my dear mother and sister for knowing what's really best for me.  I can only hope to someday return the love and support they've shown.  You guys are the best!

      1.  Get your butt to the gym! (check) 2.  Find post office and mail old license plates back to former state of residence. (check) 3.  Pick up advance copy of law school schedule. (add to tomorrow's list, 'cause they lied and it won't really be ready until then). 4.  Start buying the huge stack of required textbooks. (check, $260 later...and just for one class) 5.  Read the Constitution (better late than never, right?); I got it as a gift from my former boss and coworkers at the law firm, along with Black's Law Dictionary, both of which were very much appreciated. (read the intro/history of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence so far). 6.  Get oil and filter change. (check) 7.  Update blog. (check) 8.  Rent movies. 9.  Hit the grocery store before Bonnie and Charlie come around. 10.  Find new tunes for the iPod. 11.  Make tomorrow's ToDo list...I'm way too into lists!!  I got roped into home delivery of the local paper for 13 weeks.  I usually have no problem hanging up on telemarketers, but I was half asleep when the call came in and it sounded like a decent deal -- $38 for 13 weeks of daily newspaper delivery.  I guess that's not bad, so whatever.  Apparently I can cancel it anytime, since there's "no obligation" (my only fear is that I won't get time to read them and it'll just involve more trips to the recycling place).  I also hope no one in my apt. complex steals them when they come.  The personal trainer at my gym this morning gave me some tips for dealing with the stormy weather, so I'll share them in case anyone actually reads this and can also use the advice: -- have full tank of gas in car and don't park under trees (unfortunately, there are trees just about everywhere in my parking area); -- have lots of candles and a flashlight; -- keep plenty of water on hand (not really sure why...can you lose water????); -- put RainX on car windshield to help with visibility when caught in the frequent downpours we get here; -- unfortunately, I have since forgotten if there was any other advice. Who else thinks the media hype about storms and stocking up on things is just part of a big scam by the grocery stores to create more revenue???  Kinda like Y2K craziness?

      Just got home from the VERY long morning I spent at the DMV.  I took my Mom's advice and blinked a lot when I looked into the vision test machine, which somehow worked (though it was still hard to differentiate between the Os and the Ds).  I DID NOT want to be forced to pay for a new eye exam and prescription.  SO, I got all that annoying stuff taken care of -- license, registration, tags, title, voter registration, blah, blah, blah. It's amazing how similar the DMVs are in different states.  Long lines, lots of steps in the process, lots of shady-looking people.  I'm wondering if there's a secret DMV location where all the classy people go, 'cause I didn't see any of those types this morning.  Yup, it was pretty much the monster-truck-shirt-and-camouflage-mesh- trucker's/hunter's-hat-wearing folks with buckteeth.  I know it sounds mean, but I only say that since they also acted completely obnoxious!!  For example, fighting and slapping/elbowing each other; and these are adults I'm talking about (I don't know if they were brother/sister or husband/wife or what).  Truly amazing. Oh and back to the vision test.  There was an older woman who couldn't pass the test either.  Not surprising, though, since she couldn't even see her daughter from 5 feet away.  And she wants a driver's license??!!

      I waited in the line at the DMV for 30-40 minutes (after driving all over the county trying to find the place where I could do both my license and registration in the same visit), then proceeded to FAIL my vision test!!!! AAAAAHHHH! So, I'll go back this morning, armed with my glasses, and try again (I have an astygmatism in my left eye, but I've never really had trouble with the driver's license vision tests without them. I don't think the glasses help all that much, but we'll see.). If that doesn't work, I guess I'll have to go to the eye doctor and get a better prescription. Yuck, yuck, yuck!

      Hmm, where to begin...The chaos of my recent long-distance move has subsided and I like the new apartment a lot (barring yesterday's "fire" alarms -- one in the afternoon and another around midnight;  at least we know the ridiculously loud, high-pitched squealing noise effectively wakes everyone up).  This better not become a common occurrence in my building here, because it can be tricky when you're sound asleep.  There I was, off in dreamland (actually dreaming about a Scarlet Letter-type situation I had somehow gotten myself into, which involved some Puritans, some Quakers and an ex-boyfriend of mine...yeah, good times) when the alarm was somehow activated.  Once I woke up, it took me a while to figure out what was going on, then I had to find a sweater and shoes so as not to indecently expose myself.  Found a sweater (still half asleep, so I gave up on the shoes) and my keys and headed outside (thought about all the things I may have grabbed should there have been a real fire, i.e., cell phone, laptop).  Never really got an explanation for the alarm's activation, but oh well.  Maybe we have a prankster on our hands???   I'm looking forward to getting my class schedule, but not looking forward to shelling out all the cash for books.  In fact, I better add those books to my list of things to grab in the event of a fire.  Any suggestions on law school book savings???
