      I've got a cat on my desk. It's a small ceramic/plaster one, with tiger stripes and tawny fur. Its curled up sleeping on a blue and white pillow. It's only half the size of my hand and the pillow is just folded up material. That cat has been with me since highschool, a forgotten birthday gift from someone or other. Its been with me through five moves, three boyfriends, a degree and numerous bouts with depression. I can't even remember who gave it to me. It could be even older than I think it is. I remember it being caked with dust at several points. Laying packed for months at a time. Sitting out of place in my nicely adult and classy bedroom, its orange-pink highlight clashing with the dark wood and purple fabric. Its childish air looking out of place admist the classic black lamps, white porcelain and wrought-iron votive. So its here in my study, amongst the chaos that is my desk. It sits beside a plaster angel candleholder covered in tarnished brass paint. My confirmation candle stark white against the greenish brass. Books litter the desk with sheets of paper thick like carpet. It's kin to the white-purple dragon incense burner, its bashful sleep interrupted by puffs of smeet smoke coming from its nostrils. It's covered in glitter and sits on tarnished silver coasters. Tarnish seems to be a running theme. Awfully apt and terribly pretentious, but still, a running theme it is. Continued with the wrought-iron candleholder, empty since the fragile glass cups smashed. Three fake flowers poke haphazardly through the holes. A broken jewellery box lays open beside it.   I can't work out if the surrounding reflect me or I reflect them.

      I've decided to use this as a real diary would be used. Self-referential whining, far too much angsty goth type info about me and my usual rantings. Just so my lj friends don't get swamped in my self-destructive tendencies.   So.  First up fuck I feel like cutting and fuck I'm an idiot. I went and looked at the ritual cutting section of BME and it just fucked me up worse. I shouldn't have but its just not going away. I always do this when Nova is out. No-ones home and I feel like shit. I'm not going to but I feel like a failure just wanting to.   Second in line is the poems I wrote. That got reviewed by some dick who didn't want to face what the poems were about.  this is the poem:  memory slips hit me for six trip me up and send me down  sitting sweet soft and gentle but allofasudden your sweet                                     sweet scent is overwhelmed by the stench of lust                                            and I'm choking on pillow dust  a hand on my neck  holding me down  a traitor’s voice telling me I'm going to love it  while my every fibre screams           no  allofasudden your warm                                     soft breath sounds harsh in my ear hot on my face                                     and that voice is whispering my pain                                     and deadening my nerve  and I stop saying                                              no allofasudden I'm broken violated alone in my head allofasudden I remember  and you are gone replaced by a screaming memory slipping through my senses   this is part of the crit:  “stench” – I think I said this last time, stench has negative connotations that don’t work for me.    "and that voice is whispering my pain and deadening my nerve" - not sure why you had it spaced out here, and found this quite lack lustre.  "and I stop saying no" - not enough lead-up, and seems to contradict the previous line, this person whispers your pain…. And that is a good thing?    I edited my original version because I though the meaning wasn't quite clear but it turns out the reviewer is an idiot. *sigh* Maybe it is shit, it wouldn't surprise me since I'm no poet, but I didn't think I'd buried the meaning that deep.   Is it just me or does it seem like the reviewer is a bloke. Two girls who commented got the meaning, one from the original one from the rewrites.  The whole thing has been fucking me up for days, as has another discussion elsewhere. I guess I'm just fucked up. And the spacing won't work properly. Fuck it.

      What are your promises carved in stone?  What is your material?  How did you carve?  What was the promise?  I've got a promise of acceptance carved with ink upon the stone of my skin. A promise of pain to come and pain to go. A promise that I will go on. Etched into my flesh with ink and scars. Dark against the pale. Permanent and soul-deep.

      The one place where if you have to go there, they have to take you in.  Which it isn't. That's not home. That's your last resort, that's obligation and duty and family.  Home is where you imagine yourself on a dark day. It's where you take the ones you love. It's where you can let your guard down and go the way you want.  Sometimes it may be people.  Sometimes it's a place.  Sometimes it's nowhere to be found.

      So at some point you find The One right?  The One completes you, makes you happy, makes you everything you are and everything you aren't.  But what happens when you change?

      We all put faces on and off.  I put one on for class. It's my approachable face. I try not to blank, or glare. I try not to repeat lyrics in my head over and over. I try not to envisage hurting people. I don't smile because that isn't really approachable, not when I've forced it anyway.  I didn't realise what I did until I walked into the bathroom on the way to class once. I walked in my usual self. I build up a wall around me. Not a wall to keep others out but a wall to hide me. I keep my head down and my face blank, or glaring at the ground. I stride, not walk. I keep my face turned away and my headphones on even when the battery has run flat.  I went in as me and came out as something else entirely. I came out with my belongings safely stored, my face clear of all emotion except a sunny sort of bewilderment. I stopped thinking of terrible lies, broken promises and dead oaths. I wandered and I sauntered and I skipped along to class.   These faces I wear are nothing like me, but are still of me.

      sometimes it feels like the world is speaking in tongues.  The moon keeps shining strangely down on me at night. It will shine blue and harsh on tiled floors, hanging low in the glassed-over gaps of my ceiling.  Looming greenish yellow, glowing toxic behind clouds and mountains.  Painting gothic panorama's of silver-flecked black clouds against the grey-blue sky.  My rune won't stay put, it faces the harmony keepsake towards me.   It's like there's a message I'm too tired to see.

      If I can remember to do that, its a good day.  Even if sometimes it sets my chest on fire and air barely squeaks through my throat.  Even if sometimes it catches and tears come to my eyes and I can feel the tension build in the back of my throat.  Even if I just stop sometimes, all or who I am caught up in another.  If I can remember to breathe through that I am doing okay, I can get through.

      I made some prayer beads, Anglican ones you understand, not the rosary...  Inexpensive rosewood baubles and a cheap gold cross.  For my faith and my salvation.  I guess we all need something, a symbol to cling to.   So why does it feel like I'm still missing something?

      Early morning light sometimes seems blue. Clean. Harsh.  Afternoon light is sometimes surreal, in it's gold-yellow pervasiveness, covering everything.  How do you know when to shed light on something? When to open it up and let the light burn away the secrets and lies?  How do you know when to dull the light to candles and smooth away the edges?  How do you know when to come out of the dark?
