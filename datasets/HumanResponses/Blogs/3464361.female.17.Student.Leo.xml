      YES! The weekend, finally! I guess I shouldn't complain it's not like there is much left of school! Last night didn't do a lot, just stayed in with Brad for a relaxing night of ...Love Actually...Haha quite a funny movie (and cute of course too...poor brad) The movie has an awesome soundtrack though! Hmmm...what's cooking for tonight? Something with the girls, just not sure of what exactly! :o  Well, not much else to say right now, I'm having quite the lazy day on my Saturday! ;) Buh bye! xox

      Ahh, today seemed to go on forever and it's only 3:30pm. Today my english class went and saw the Twelvth Night which was pretty funny i'd say for $8.50!! Then the usual...class after class. Haha, I'm proud of myself I finished my whole photography assignment in one class! :p  Emily's been gone forever! She comes back early July I think? I hope, it's still weird not having her around, can't wait to see her.  Anything going on this weekend? YAY, the movie priemere of the Band Trip!! That should be funny...yet...embarrassing! Well not much else to say, except my msn is screwing up. Apparently I've just signed in on another computer...GREAT! Just Great! Ahhh Leadership presentation tomorrow Alana, YIKES! ANNNNNND...musical auditions for GRRRRREASE (yahoo!) tomorrow Kt, ah we'll do excellent! LoL. xox muah.

      Wow, my first blog...YAY! Hahah, thanks Hannah for inspiring me! Only about a month left of school! I can't wait, even though this is a super easy semester it'll be nice to get out and have a nice relaxing summer. Re-wind...It'll be nice to get out and work all summer...that is, if I get a job, which I really hope I do soon! Well, no more camp this year...good thing or a bad thing? I don't know, I think I'll miss it quite a lot! Kelowna is just as much fun though! :p And Whistler...the most funnest trip ever. YAY CANADA DAY! Anyways...not much else to write today but I'll write in here later of course. Girls, you should all get these so we can blag away. Haha...that sounds funny. Toodles! xox

      Wow! One week left of grade eleven...and then next year...the school is ours to rock! Haha! Ahh so much stuff happening lately being the end of the year. This Sunday..Hannah's lovely dance performance, can't wait it's gonna be long...and AWESOME! Got two interviews at McDick's...yes I am in desperate need of a summer job, lol I think it might be sorta fun though!  This weekend...not much is happening since we have exams next week. YAY, I only have one! :p Wait till next weekend rolls around though, there will be plenty to do I'm sure :) Hopefully the weather gets really hot soon cause I'm not too impressed with all this wind and clouds! :( Emily...Comes home in like 16 days! Ahh, this is going to be a very exciting day, we haven't seen her for a good 5 months and ahh it's weird what happens when one member of a tight knit group of friends leaves... Whistler is coming up soon too..can't wait, once again better be good weather or else I will have my words! Hahaha! Well, not much is going on tonight, just hanging out with Brad when he gets off work! I'm not telling him, but we're watching NEVER BEEN KISSED. Muahaha!  Love all, Lia xo

      Well...It's been quite a while since I've written here! School is now officially out, and even thought I didn't perform EXCELLENTLY on my exams...I still did good overall in school, heehee! Emily is finally home sweet home now, aww it's so nice to have her back! =) Jamee came and visited in Victoria for a week, I only got to see her once, but it was still such a good time considering I haden't seen her for over 5 years...holy moly! Haha! Whistler was awesome let me tell you...as good as last year? I dunno last year was...haha well...awesome! But of course it was still the same as usual...ooodles of fun! The fireworks were cancelled for Canada because of some fire regulation...REGULATION SMEGULATION. Whoooo cares! Oh well... :( Granny was just here visiting too, I haven't seen her since we went over and saw her in the hospital, she is doing so much better I'm so proud of her! I can't wait to go to Kelowna at the end of the summer where they live...so hot there, so nice and relaxing before grade 12 starts, ewww!  Katie MADE me try bubble tea! Haha, I'm not a huge fan of the tapioca balls slithering up the straw and down the throat, but it was still quite yummy I guess? I wonder if Kyle liked it, or if maybe he was just being polite...hmmm! lol!  I'm now working harder than ever at McDonalds.YAY!Ha, I guess its' not that bad. I'm sure I'll start to hate it sooner or later, but for now I don't find it terrible!  AHHHHH! Already July 10? The summer is going to go by so fast it's so sad! My birthday however is in 18 days! YAY, 18 days until I turn the B-i-G  1-7. Lol. Ahh, only two more years until I'll be hitting up the bars and dance floors. Two years is wayyy too long. Road trip next summer to Alberta girls?! Fake I.D's this summer?! Hahaa! aww...well That's about all I have to say for now, I'll talk to ya'll later! .....Did I just say Ya'll?! Yuk! -------------m u a h. --------------
