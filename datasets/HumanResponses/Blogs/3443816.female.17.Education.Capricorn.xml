      	Guns should be banned in America, or stricter regulations should be put upon their sale and use.  The only purpose of a gun is to kill, and it is very efficient.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001, of the 13,752 murders in America, 8,719 were committed with a firearm.  Of the 8,719 murders by firearm, 6,790 were by handgun.  Guns accounted for 3,686 more deaths than every other murder method combined.  During the year 2000, firearms were responsible for 16,586 suicides.  Would these people still have killed themselves if there was no gun? It is safe to assume majority of them would have found another way, but how many could have also been saved from the alternative methods?  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the firearms-related death rate for children under 15 years old in the United States is nearly 12 times higher than that of the other 25 industrialized countries combined.  Gun supporters often tote that a gun is necessary as an aide to one’s safety, but how is a gun helpful when if kept in the home it is four times more likely to be involved in an unintentional shooting, seven times more likely to be used in a criminal assault or homicide, and eleven times more likely to be used to commit suicide, than to actually be used in self-defense? Many gun lobbyists also proclaim that it is their constitutional right to bear a gun.  In all actuality, the Second Amendment means, “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed” in order to maintain security of a free state.  To support this, the U.S. Supreme Court has never overturned a gun control law on the grounds of the Second Amendment.  Former Chief of Justice of the U.S. Warren E. Burger deciphered it as, “The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that the ‘states armies’ - ‘the militia’, would be maintained for the defense of the state… The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires.”  The comma in the Second Amendment between, “A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free state,” and, “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed,” is a qualifier.  If the first part of the sentence is unfulfilled, the second half is null and void. Obviously, guns are not going to be eradicated any time soon, so what can be done in the meantime to help protect the anti-gun section of society?  85% of all registered voters in the year 2000 favored requiring a license before a handgun could be purchased.  72% of Americans also said they would vote to require licensing and registration on new handgun purchases.  84% of Virginian gun owners would like to see criminal background checks for all gun sales at gun shows.  Majority of America agrees that guns are a hazard and should be more closely regulated.  So why aren’t they?  The only explanation why these excellent regulatory steps aren’t being implemented is the insane profit of gun manufacturers and what public officials are in office.  Gun companies need to have strict regulations now, and need to stop flooding the market and bypassing the weak boundaries they somewhat have currently.  If for any reason, because the Harvard School of Public Health has discovered that 2/3 of students in grades 6-12 say they could obtain a firearm within 24 hours.  Guns are meant to kill, and they are more often killing the innocent and young, not the boogieman people think will sneak into their house and rob them.  The use of a firearm to resist a violent assault actually increases the victim’s risk of injury and death.  Are these thousands of stolen lives really worth that feeling of safety that will more than likely never even be tested?

      	Murder and death both mean literally the taking of something’s life, but murder is “to kill unlawfully,” according to Webster’s Dictionary, and death is the simple “cessation of all vital phenomena without capability of resuscitation.”  Who can honestly decide that the putting to death of a homicidal madman is better than the acts he committed?  How is it acceptable for him to be forced to cease all vital phenomena, and not the people whose lives he took?  Do they not both maybe have families that will grieve them? Shouldn’t killing another human be looked at in black and white- completely wrong in any sense? 	Taking a closer look at the death penalty currently instituted, it is perspicuous to see that it is practiced tendentiously against minorities.  The odds of receiving a death sentence are nearly four times higher if the defendant is black than if he or she is white.  Of those sentenced to death for crimes committed as juveniles, two-thirds are people of color.  Also, of the people currently on death row as of 2002, 82% were convicted in cases involving white victims.  Nationally only 50% of all murder victims are white, but in cases where an execution of the defendent has occurred, over 80% of the murder victims were white.  Discernibly the justice system of America is under the apocryphal axiom that Caucasian people have some mystically greater inherent value.  Currently, the death penalty is a state matter with few restraints or guidelines by the Supreme Court.  Each state goes about this matter very differently; some states have outlawed the barbaric death penalty, others such as Texas have an express lane for those whose murderous acts have been deemed “heinous”.  An African-American man growing up in Philadelphia is 11.5 times more likely to end up on death row than if he grew up in Georgia or Alabama.  72% of Maryland death-row inmates are black.  Of all executions from 1993 to 2003, Texas has been responsible for 38% alone, or about one-third.  As if not clear enough, a problem of standard can easily be detected in this system by simply looking at the fact that North Carolina has 41 times the amount of people on death row as New York, which had 5.  Indiana calls for 16 aggravating circumstances to murder, while Nevada calls for only one to be recognized.  It is also possible to be executed for hijacking an aircraft, but only in Georgia.    Enforcement or practice of the death penalty is completely a moral dilemma.  Pro-death penalty supporters claim that it is a just punishment and provides relief to the victim’s family.  But shouldn’t humans be more civilized than the standard “eye for an eye”?  Wouldn’t it be a better example for future generations of this country if current lawmakers could just be the bigger person and outlaw this theory that it is ok to “kill back”?  It is time to stop preaching “two wrongs don’t make a right” and to finally trust in it and live decent lives filled with equality and peace for all.  Banning capital punishment would be the wisest step for America, and an enlightening decision for all.

      	  Marriage is considered to be exclusively “the legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife”.  Could this idea possibly be just as outdated as “separate but equal”?  In the liberalizing times now at hand, many Americans believe that gays and lesbians have just as much right to be recognized legally with their chosen partners, whatever sex that may be.  Clinton’s Defense of Marriage Act is outdated and discriminatory.  In the “DOMA”, marriage was defined as “only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.”  The opposition to those striving for equality often comment that marriage is a “sacred institution,” but who wants to live in an institution?  Another “sacred institution” in the past was that of motherhood, and a woman’s only place being in front of the stove and pregnant. 	  Another reason claimed against gay and lesbians is the fact that homosexuality is unnatural, and by allowing it we will somehow destroy society.  Unnatural?  The closest animal relative, the Bonobo Chimpanzee, has been observed 100% of the time in captivity and the wild to be bi-sexual and have sexual encounters with both sexes, if not completely homosexual.  There are no exclusively heterosexual Bonobo Chimpanzee’s known to man.  Every sexual behavior engaged in by human homosexuals, except fetishes, has been observed in homosexual animals, including the fabrication and use of sexual appliances.  One of the smartest creatures man adores, the bottlenose dolphin, is more likely to form a homosexual life-bond than a heterosexual life-bond, including sex and affection, both male and female.  Since the birds do it, and the bees do it, how is it unnatural for man to do it? 	  Currently in America, Vermont is the only state that fully recognizes same-sex marriage, including benefits of federal protections afforded married couples including: Social Security, Medicare, disability, family leave, and health care.  While the country is still split at about 53% against and 44% in favor of gay marriage, the director of the gay rights organization Human Rights Campaign Elizabeth Birch reminds, “If not for courts, African-Americans would not have had the right to vote, women would not have the right to vote.  The purpose of a constitution is to protect the minority group from the wrath of the majority.”   	  Solutions are slim, but homosexual couples can currently get what is known as a “Domestic Partnership”.  A slight problem arises with this alternative route though; “separate but equal” comes into play again.  No way can separate but equal honestly entertain the hope of equivalence.  In a Domestic Partnership, couples are denied such rights as over 1,049 federal protections, benefits, and responsibilities available only to married couples, and the Full Faith and Credit act does not apply to a Domestic Partnership. 	  Sitting President George Bush called for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage early February of 2004.  He claims that, “The preservation of marriage rises to this (constitutional) level of national importance.  The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution, honoring- honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith.  Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society.”  Funny that America’s divorce rate is 50% and over 1million teens are pregnant each year with how contusive marriage is to society, but only if it is between a man and a woman.  How is it possible that the love between two same-sex partners could possibly send society any further down the spiral of decency it has already descended? 	  Equality is the American dream.  “All men are created equal,” unless you happen to fall in love with someone of the same sex, is just as wrong as “all men are created equal” except men of a different skin color.  It began most notably with the fight for Civil Rights, then the fight for the Vote, now the fight for equality of gays and lesbians.  This slow, but much needed, liberalization of the minds of America is much overdue.  ALL must be equal, or America will forever be a lie.  How amazing it will be once Utopia is reached! Until there is true equality, same sex couples find joy in each other without the court-approved paper stating them as legally bonded.  “And that kindness and good-nature,” as Sir Thomas More states in Utopia, “unite men more effectually and with greater strength than any agreements whatsoever, since thereby the engagements of men’s hearts become stronger than the bond and obligation of words.”
