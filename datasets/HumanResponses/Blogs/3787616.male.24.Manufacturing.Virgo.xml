      There is this guy at work, whom I have a  serious  crush on.  I wish I didn't, because it makes it hard to concentrate on work when I keep seeing him walk by and talk to people around me, and to me, too.  Although, at least today he helped me out by wearing some jeans that just looked  bad  on him.  I dunno how to explain it, they just looked  goofy .    The worst part?  I don't know if he's gay or straight.  My gaydar 'pings' on him every now and then, but...well... bah .  I just don't know and I'm too shy to just come right out and ask him if he is.   Maybe some day...   In other, more  annoying  news...  Work   sucks  .    Internal ISO audit is going on in our plant this week and they are driving me  crazy  (Yes, I know, it's a short drive,  stfu ).  I've got homework to do tonight (re-reading the ISO standard and some of our internal policies) to try and dispute some of the  questionable  action requests that are being written.   Bastards.   Causing me to do work at home, the  horror !

      I know - I haven't posted in days.  Things have been going on.  Good things, sorta, for a change.  Went out to dinner with Susan on Saturday at a really neat restraunt called The Melting Pot.  It's a Fondue place - very nice, VERY expensive.  I was expecting 80 or so...it was 130.  I hope my eyes didn't pop out of my head when I saw the cheque, yikes.  But, good times were had, so, it's worth it.  Saw Spiderman 2 on Friday - excellent movie.  It's one of those movies that I watched too closely though, and it made me start examining my own life and thoughts... I really hate it when that happens.  But, it all works out in the end because I've decided I need to make some changes to my life anyway.  And, in that vein, I signed up at a gym today.  I go on Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 for my fitness test to see where I am starting (my guess, is negative 10).  I just have to keep telling myself that it's good for me, both physically and mentally to try and stay psyched up for it.  Doing something like this is totally not in my nature, but hey, tis the time for doing things that've never been done before, so let's go for it, right?  Right!  Also, I got my ear pierced.  I think everyone I've told has asked me "Why??" and I don't know aside from "I just wanted to." so there.  I think it looks cool and surprisingly, has been painless so far (3 days and counting).  I think I'll like it even more once I swap it out for a hoop instead of the stud they have to use to pierce it with.  I'm actually planning on getting another one just above it once this one is healed up.  Let's see, what else has happened in the last few days.  Oh yeah.  I went out to lunch with a lady from work and the guy whom I have a total crush on, on Friday.  If the girl hadn't been with us, I'd probably have asked him if he were gay or straight as it's sort of driving me crazy not knowing.  But, then I think, perhaps I should wait until I'm in better shape and better looking to make my move...  I think that's probably the insecurity talking there.  I hate to ruin a decent friendship by trying to make it more, too.  We'll see how things play out I guess.  Anyway, so, this is the big week.  Diet restarts and my first attempt at working out at a gym starts as well.  I just hope and pray that it goes well, I enjoy it, and can stick with it.  I want to be thin!  =P

      Well, I'm  supposed  to be having dinner with a friend this Saturday night, but I think she's going to end up standing me up.  I left her a message Tuesday night asking her to call me back and confirm that we were still on...and she hasn't called back.    This would  not  be the first time she's done this, but it very well could be the  last  time.  She is the wife of a friend of mine who died and I only really knew her through him and playing briefly with her in Camelot...so maybe I should just break the ties to her and write her off.  Dunno.  And yes, I know, I didn't update yesterday.  I had every intention of doing it - I even had several things I wanted to say, but I just couldn't get the ideas to flow to the fingers.  I sat here and stared at the screen and just couldn't get them to materialize into words.   Go me!   Of course, now I've  forgotten  the ideas...  Today is the day...I'm going to sign up at a gym after work today.  I'm scared and nervous about doing it - partially for financial reasons (it isn't cheap) and partially because I'm going to feel terribly out of place.  Yay for being a big, fat man surrounded by a bunch of skinny little bitches.  Meh.  Wish me luck for sticking with it.
