      Hey,  how is everyone this is strange I'm still not use to this blog thing but its great see I found this great poem well I think it is tell me what you think  "you hurt me,  you think I care?,  you destroyed me,  you think I care,  you made me cry,  and again you think I care?  well if you thought that,  then you thought right,  I do care that you hurt me,  and destroyed me and made me cry,  but in the end it makes me stronger,  colder,  ice"

      well tonight I went to church (yay) I know some of my friends look at me funny when I say yay I'm going to church coz before I was all out in to other stuff but maybe its just they don't know what I feel when I go there I feel like I'm returning home which is unusally for me since I got kicked out from my house 2 years ago now! but anyway after church we went to maccas and in my true style there is this one guy that hates me so I started throwing ice cubes at him ha ha but then he shoved them down my top and it got stuck there and I didn't want to get it out :( so I drove home yes after 10 (my licence runs out then) with this huge piece of ice melting it was so cold! I have to get my revenge hmmmm.........

      Hey there. I don't have a lot to talk about I'm a little annoyed with some of my friends today because they made fun of what I believe in but yet if someone is mean to them for their choice I'm always there supporting them 100% and usually shouting abuse back and the rude people who are being mean it just doesn't seem fair why does life suck so much that this is what it comes down to what we wear doesn't make us who we are we make ourselfs who we are its not my fault people won't take the time to get to know me! and respect what I believe in...
