        I'm trying, but nothing seems to work...     I feel so two-faced sometimes.   The way I seem at school is mostly who I am. But some things...well...with friends I refuse to be selfish, to talk about myself when there's better things to talk about...but...sometimes I really feel like   I want people to know things  , and yet I don't want people to know, and at the same time I want to prove to myself that I can actually do something...that's why I turned to poetry. In poetry...anything to   make the poem sound nice .  I don't know...   I spent about 45 minutes talking to Alex Miramontes after tutoring. I never imagined how so many people I thought I kinda knew -- or at least who I thought   had direction in their life   -- are stoners/boozers/sluts/whatever. And all I worry about is like, finals and spring sports.   I take things for granted sometimes  ...One thing I learned about myself today is that I'm a listener. I don't mind hearing people talk...as long as   they want to say something, I want to listen  . If anyone has anything they need to talk about...I don't know what people think of me, but I would be happy to help people out any way I could.   Being the speaker, I feel like I'm wasting people's time sometimes, but having someone talk to me and them knowing that someone would be willing to give up some of their time for them, that's what I'd rather do. And if they need help or whatever, I'm there to give it. Honestly, I'd bend over backwards to   smash a spider that's 10 feet away   just cause it scared a friend. That's me, I guess. I would put you guys first any day. Even at my expense. I could be kinda low and down, but if everyone else is perfectly   content and happy with life  , that's my reward.

        Don't read into this...it's just a poem I wanted to write.    What can I do to show you That I still just want to know you That this feeling I have for you After all this time's still so true  Feels like nothing can go right Like I've already lost this fight Like my entire life might Forever darken to night  You leave me feeling so cold And I'm not the one to try be bold Though new chapters may yet unfold This story's going the way it was foretold  But just to see the mere sight Of you can make my world feel so bright One glimpse and I'm all tight Just can't get you out of my mind  And yet I've suffered for so long And all my moves have been so wrong I've tried to handle it, to be strong But all I can do is write this song

         Over and over again  I make the same mistakes, it doesn't end And though this feeling of pain is true It's worth it in the end, I did it for you  At times you walk away and leave me unwhole And nothing can cure me, cure my ailing soul Sometimes I feel my world has been torn apart Then you turn around and give me back my heart

        Mmm... urlLink Sensibility Test ...   "You are...55% sense-able! Normal as can be! First the good news: You're not   blind, deaf, stuffy-nosed or unable to touch things    . Now the bad news: You're not particularly good at any of that senses stuff. But hey, neither is the rest of the world.   You're not superhuman ,  but you've got just enough in the senses department that   you won't be ostracized and laughed at   for years to come. Well, not for your senses anyway. But you should really   get that skin condition looked at  ."

        OK, I got it figured out. I'll write about school and friends and stuff on Claire's blog, and here I'll talk more about what I'm thinking and everyday weird things and stuff. And about how I hate homework. With a passion. Cuz I wanted to go to the movies...but...yeah. Not enough time.   Actually I think my Winter Ball picture isn't bad. I look a   bit more mature   than usual. My shirt was cool. Like fire compared to the ice of Joanna's dress...or something stupid like that. And I like my hair parted more than spiked...but whatever. Ouch. I was looking for a frame for it, and I cut my left thumb on the glass. Cuts get more painful after a while...endorphins wearing off...surprised I remembered something from biology didn't you. Didn't you! Yuh-huh...Anyhoo I found a frame and washed it, but...I...kinda...put the picture in first. So, some of the glossy stuff washed off. Grr. If only they invented water-resistant glossy picture stuff...  the world would be a better place ...   Super Bowl...  go Raiders  ...that would be cool. Do you guys really want a party at my house tomorrow? Cuz I got new sofas in my living room, which are nice. I could burn a CD to play on the stereo...  50 Cent, In Da Club  . AHH!! So good. But I have a fucking 27 inch TV.   Damn small.   At least I have that lovely bird fountain in my backyard. And a GameCube. With TimeSplitters 2. And a Lord of the Rings calendar in my room. And   posters .  Which makes my house/room the   best ever .   If you're interested in the party...could we get   another chatroom up tonight   about it? Thanks.

         Woohoo .  I finished all the formatting I could -- or wanted -- to do with this lovely little we  blog   (though I couldn't use the Rams' colors of navy and gold because of the color of the brackets and Blogger link). I spent   too much time   doodling with minutiae like the color of the individual words and underscores in the footer. Sigh. Well I didn't exactly make that deadline of one night, but I got   close enough .

Like,   I want to make my own design by tomorrow evening   fast. That'll be impossible.  Until then...here's a link to a way better blog:  urlLink  Claire's pride and glory

        My dad bought 2 cartons of Breyer's (Breyers > Dreyers) ice cream! Be jealous.   Blah...today in history, did anybody notice the guy sitting next to Martin Sheen (Mr. West Wing President) in the jeep?   Vernon Dursley (Dudley's dad) from the Harry Potter movies  , hello...wow, people who actually liked the movies didn't recognize him...or maybe I'm just making stuff up. I don't know. Chem was lazy...  Blurry played on the radio!   Score. Nobody got even halfway in the lab, but that's par for the course, considering Sykes is our teacher...lunch, no basketball, but something "important" about Melissa is permeating through the daily gossip. So obviously,   I have no clue what it is  . Mark my words, I'll be in the know...I'll hear the "inside things"...one day...*shakes fist like Erik*  PE, I think I have shin splints...in any case I got scored on again by Randy when I should've blocked it. Parisa and Basho are kinda strong actually. (Oh yeah, sweet goal Basho.) Ankur's definition of cool: being able to   sing along to obscure Michael Jackson songs  . Oh well, there goes my chance...Jennifer was pimped out in track, she had the whole Chinese school shirt (honestly, it was nice), fly Nike kicks, and track bag look going...meeting her   daily prerequisite of hotness  , no doubt. Belinda tried me in a quick one on one, repping for Warwick...it was tough, but I managed to come out on top at the end...Thornton pride :-D We got our track clothes today (I wasn't last...soph privileges baby!), I think they kinda suck though. I'd even be willing to shell out my own money for them. $60...hmm, that's what, only   2 years' worth allowance, give or take  ...not so bad...

        Mwahahha...I cut dance class...just to watch SportsCenter...I'm such a rebel...   For all those poor souls forced to suffer through the daily torture that is Lott,   I feel you guys.   Wtf is this...if we have one source card too little, we fail the whole goddamn research report?   That's just bs  ...Lott is a decent guy, but his rules are way too harsh. Speaking of harsh...Mr. O rags on Thi like daily...Thi: "I walked through some sprinklers, they sprayed up to my knees." Mr. O: "So I guess   they went up 2 inches?  " Wow. I want the tennis team's $35 polo shirts...the absolute personificiation of awesome. PE...still one goal scored on me. Woohoo.   No more stepping on my shoes!   Yeesh. Track was pleasantly bearable today.   Tourney: Jennifer trounced Claire (we still love you though!) 11-0 (roughly). Jason beat Shanil 10-6, but Shanil didn't want to finish. For the quarters, I'm betting Jason will beat Alex cuz Jason has the size. Alex has bad dribbles and is pretty streaky...but if he's got his shot (though   don't tell him he has it, it'll jinx him  ), then he can win. Abdullah and Jennifer...such a mismatch, I'm wasting space here...I mean come on,   Jennifer wins, no contest   :-D Eugene and Sunny...Sunny's a decent player, but honestly he's not in Eugene's league. Erik and Ankur...Ankur won their first match, but if Erik shows some of his rumored post skills...I say   it's a toss-up  .  "You might gotta go get you some Scooby-Doos, you gotta throw in the Scooby-Doos...  those are shoes by the way..."

        I'm rather tired...silly track...even thinking about it makes me exhausted. 10 hours of practice a week? Crazy. That's a lot of ass exercises...whee...   In the tournament today, Ankur beat Owen 11-7 (the main event), and Sunny beat Samyak 11-6 (too bad nobody was watching). Abdullah is presently beating Simran 4-0...ouch, poor Sim, he   really got screwed over  ...everybody does realize that the brackets are just pretense for an   Abdullah-Eugene final   right? ...right? That'll be really cool though.   History...shhh everybody,   desperate times call for desperate measures  , so I was forced to forge my dad's signature for my progress report...I'm such a bad kid. And how are we supposed to take notes on movies if you can't even see your paper? Damn, I was scored on   for the first time   in PE courtesy of Kevin. It's all good though, it was this tricky shot that grazed the left post and ricocheted into the goal. English...I didn't finish my journal entry but since Harris only looks to see if you wrote something, I just bs'd it...something like..."I hope nobody does read this, for if I do have my journal read   I will be so screwed and fail this class  . Ah, too bad." And Gina stamped it. Yes!  There's presently a campaign to pants Richard (so money's obviously involved)...uh...don't ask,   you don't wanna know...

        I got 10 hours of sleep last night. Wow. First time in roughly a year or so.   Adam came over to my house before we went to basketball.   He said I have a cool house  ...very flattering. I poured him a cup full of soda, about 80% of it was fizz. We walked over to the courts --   shhh...don't tell anybody  ...Adam snuck into the women's restroom at Los Cerritos. That's right. It was the first time he did it when old enough to realize how fun/weird it is.   Erik got stung by a bee at Alex's house.   Erik said he thought it was a leaf...that's a very fast-moving, yellow leaf eh? My shot was crazy off but Adam was on fire and Pat...is just Pat.   In a good way of course.   (I wanna play him one on one sometime.)   I had a rematch with Alex that didn't count for anything, I won 12-10.   Yeehaw.   I almost won at 11 with a nice reverse, but oh well. Eugene came to play Pat, he won 11-4 because God forsook Pat. In the meanwhile, me, Adam and Pat (RAP or PAR, whatever floats your boat) played WHORE. Not HORSE, but WHORE. It's   cleaner and more appropriate for us kids  , cuz instead of HO, HOR, and HORS, you have WH, WHO, and WHOR. Erik and Alex left so PAR/RAP had the   laziest game of 21 in recorded history  . Adam won, obviously. He's the legend of lazy, whereas Pat is the prince of procrastina--er...I'll shut up now.

        Uhhh...today was cool...   Chem, Melissa and Jenn were all grossing out over Chapter 7 in Snow Falling on Cedars, but right after that they were like...aww!! (so and so) is so nice and cute!! I read that book like right when it came out, I forgot most of it though...suffice it to say,   it's a weird book.   Rally...they were almost like white girls in black girls' bodies they danced so bad...but   TIM BROWN!!!!111one!!!1   I've never seen a famous person that close before. I still don't know how he came to American...or Fremont for that matter. Made my day though. Sucked for Basho that he lost his voice, but I'm impressed with how he put it in the best light. He used a paper to write all his messages...  kinda Memento-esque  ...  Track practice was hard-ish but satisfying when completed..."badminton boy" and Alex joined us for Camp AJ...aww, so sweet. Though Ankur and Pat were relaxing/lazy and   just sat there watching and pointing and laughing  . I'll probably never run hurdles ever. Besides, Jennifer is a very intimidating coach with the whole beater and visor and all that.   Ph33r h3r.   Yeahh...I lost 11-9 to Alex in the tournament. I could've won, but oh well. I really want to play more. Then went to Chopsticks with him...their food isn't THAT bad. The guy asked me if I had money...he was joking...right? Alex is daring, he stuck his potsticker into the soy sauce mixed with like...red orange thick paste stuff. Nasty.   And the game was boring and really sloppy and we murdered. We all thought #14 on Kennedy looked like a skinny Erik...except as Adam said,   "a little less white."   Speaking of Erik, crazy football player...but he couldn't stand sitting in the stands for 1 and a half hours straight...so disappointing. After the game Jennifer and Ankur   ripped Mr. Nelson a new...uh...  I won't even try it. And I biked home. Don't worry Kat, I didn't get run over or nothing :-D

       Before I go "sleep" (i.e., actually work on homework)...thanks Kat, Basho, Erik and Pat for the cool comments and all that...  you're the best friends a guy could have  , even when my legs get sore or weird disagreement things happen or it gets really windy or I insist on dissing badminton. :-D

        Random thoughts:   Blah, I want to sprint...I'm just kinda afraid of being slow and losing and stuff (I have a crappy starting burst)...oh well.   You only live once.     Don't worry Kat and Belinda, with your sponge-like learning abilities you'll be crazy good hurdlers in no time (almost as good as the Jennifers, perchance?)...and just so you know,   badminton is the devil.   I mean sure, Alex might do it...very enticing, eh girls...but you can resist!  Mr. Lott has been surprisingly pleasant this week. It's almost worse than if he were a jackass about things.  Today was my last lab with Melissa...so sad...  *TeaR*    My goddamn dad...absolutely ignores any good things I do or accomplishments in my life ("good grades? they could be better"..."you ran 2 miles for practice? ok"), and relentlessly jumps on me whenever I make one small error (he'll brush off the countless times I washed the dishes punctually, but if I'm late one night..."you're so selfish!   i think i need to send you to boarding school!  "). Damn I hate it.

       I'm in a good mood right now. I'm about to make Mr. Lott look like an   absolute stupidass  , my dad's pleasant again, I bought...something cool, I played some basketball and even sprinted a little bit.   What more is there to life than that?   (OK, lots of other stuff...but still, you get my point...I think...)

        Haha...it's not like there was a gigantic clamor or anything for it (*cough*Basho*cough*), but I've decided to add a little commenting thingamabobber to my blog here...so you can like, comment at your own free will...it was complicated and took forever and HTML sucks, but it was worth it.   As for my boring weekend...well...basketball with the guys on Saturday, then Jack in the Box with Alex, Erik and Eugene (it was weird cuz we barely talked while eating, but after eating it was way more fun), then we went to Alex's house to watch as   my CPU alter ego balled out of control   in NBA 2k3 (he has crazy shots, driving skills, and looks almost black to boot...pretty good for his   68 rating  ). Today, I played basketball for two hours and got pissed at myself for wasting my summer and first semester when I could've been practicing ball instead. Oh well,   never too late to start  ...  Oh yeah (thanks Kat)...enjoy President's Day everybody. Respect the legacy of our founding fathers by...uh...loafing around and watching TV and   catching up on much-needed sleep   and stuff.

Physically, I'm feeling good...but as for how I am overall...well...it's not like things have gotten worse for me, it's about the same as before...maybe I'm just looking at things differently, seeing them as worse than they really are...

Haven't seen her for almost two years   (good ol' Thornton days), and she's still the same cool person who skips a lot and twirls and drives...in a way she's a lot like Parisa, even her voice and how they look...and me,   I was wearing sweats  .

         I'm hot, sweaty and nervous, plus a myriad  Of other symptoms, like a girl on her first period No don't laugh, I'm being serious You curious on what I'm sayin? Your theory is I'm acting delirious, seems I'm always havin' fits You sayin' I need to get back to my cheery biz And clearly it's somethin' that I would like I want this to be right, to be settled, I don't have all night But this problem's still in sight, too dark to see the light And it's possible I might not be able to win this fight What am I doing, I'm dazed, confused, I've lost my way I haven't found the words to say for so many days How can I figure out just what to do When I don't have a clue on how to get myself renewed I'd still like a friend I could open up to Still want someone I could tell what's up to Someone who wants to hear everything I do, bad or good Comfort me when I've fallen into one of those crappy moods If not feel, at least act like they're only doin' it cuz they could Maybe I'm blind, maybe there's already someone who would Do that for me, go to bat for me Give me some advice on the this and thats of misery It's bad for me to act so sorry But I'm sad you see, be glad it's not you but me And I would like to know how to turn it around I've been run to the ground not just by leaps but bounds And I haven't made a sound, I'm losing myself quietly Like I'm on a diet see, starving myself from society From feelin' happy, yeah it's not revolutionary But I need my own fairy godmother, someone legendary To help me carry myself back to clarity Wait I'd like to clarify, don't want nobody be surprised I just need to live my life, rid it of this pointless strife And this is the price I paid for the mistakes I made But maybe for all this pain I'll be better for it someday

        The guitar is fun. But I would kill for an electric. Yes, you read that right. Kill. OK, maybe maim...or ravage...or fight...considering it's me, it would probably be more like poke randomly. You get the point though. I hope. The frets aren't so wide, and it's a lot easier to carry. Plus, with an amp...so cool.   I haven't found so much time to practice though...silly AIM...there's not enough hours in the day anymore. I'm sleeping at 11:30 again...woohoo. Mr. Lott is a fruitcake. We spent our whole weekends working on our history projects, then he spits in our face and says we didn't follow exact MLA procedure. Even though we followed the exact format in   his own packet.   Oh well. I want to read  Count of Monte Cristo  now, Eugene says it's good. Actually I have read it before...like, the   My First Reader   version.  Decision time. Track...or badminton...sigh...

        Wow...two blogs and a subprofile...something's gotta give soon. My life may be interesting, but not  that  interesting...;)   Well, I had my physical and stuff, it was really   quick and painless  . Jennifer was there, she just showered so her hair was still wet...cuz she had to make sure she was prepared for the big event. The pressure, you know. Excruciating. Tiffany said my brother was paler than her...  and that's saying something  . She, Selena and May are doing badminton, Belinda, Kat and both Charmaines are doing track...not including everyone else taking second years (the list goes forever, I won't even try)...never knew all these people were doing spring sports.  Then dance class...I met Preal (sp?) who's a pretty cool guy...from some   no-name ghetto school called Challenger or something  ...and we're doing 4 recitals at Ohlone in June. Bitch mother. You guys wanna come see me look really dumb? :-D  I detest tutoring.

        Oof...for some reason I'm finding tabs hard to catch on to...All the Small Things is hard to do with an acoustic...I'll just stick to the good old 54-page course textbook.   Badminton...or track...or tennis...or neither? I'm so indecisive with these things. I know   I should've played something last year  ...I haven't even really met up with any coaches yet...oh well, I'll just see what happens. Other than that,   no worries  ...except, stupid chem test...and I still want a new wallet. Why? Beats me...

I'm finding my way back to sanity again Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I get there Take a breath and hold on tight Spin around one more time And gracefully fall back to the arms of grace  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah Where I wanna be  I'm looking past the shadows in my mind, into the truth and I'm Trying to identify the voices in my head, God, I wish it were you Let me feel one more time what it feels like to feel and Break these callouses off of me one more time  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah  Oh, I don't want a thing from you I bet you're tired of me waiting for the  Scratch to fall off of your table to the ground  Cause I just wanna be here now  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to stand outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah Where I wanna be

       Today kinda sucked. I don't want to start blogging again regularly because I presently seem to have no time to do anything. For the last three Mondays or so I've been working from 6 to 8:20 on homework (stupid essays), leaving on 8:26 and getting to school right before the bell rings. Stupid Lott marks you tardy if you open the door when the bell rings, though.    Man...24 hours a day isn't enough nowadays. Even with only 6 hours sleep. Wow, sleep deprivation really does have bad effects. All day I've just been saying really dumb things to everybody, or really just not wanting to say anything. And I spilled my lunch...those beef patty thingies are too heavy.  Track practice was OK, we left a little early...man I want to be fast. Then I decided to bike around a bit. It's dangerous riding a bike nowadays. Cars always seem to be trying to run you over as if you have a bulls-eye on your back or something. Maybe it had something to do with me biking in the street, I don't know. Also I passed an anti-war rally at the Hub. They were playing "I'm Proud to be an American" and had signs like..."50% of Iraqis are under age 15." It was all kinda funny. Then I passed Holy Spirit, they had a service on a Monday night? Maybe I'm missing something...

       Soapbox time again, kiddies. Sit tight, fasten your seatbelts, and tuck in. And...sorry if I'm just repeating the sentiments expressed by countless others before me...I just need to write this.  War...OK...we've finally done it. We've reached that inexorable point of no return. Iraq has been invaded, the front lines are drawn, "Operation Iraqi Freedom" has officially begun. Freedom, true...but at what cost? Less than a week into the war, and official counts estimate over four times the Allied deaths (22) to Iraqis (5). Our president initially stated this war effort would be quick and decisive, a concerted, explosive effort that would "shock and awe" the poor defenseless Iraqi soldiers, our "30+" allies, and our many dissenters. Unfortunately for his case, many Iraqis are indeed not very defenseless, they are fighting back; they feel more strongly and stirringly the pride of their country (which our side, which has persistently urged Iraqi surrender, has apparently disregarded) than any sort of universally moral decision to aid the ousting of their president. It is without question that Saddam Hussein is some of the worst sort of scum to exist on this planet; he has gassed his own civilians, used them as human shields, and even killed his personal advisors when they dared to disagree with him. Nevertheless, it is folly to assume that Iraqis aren't prideless; it is folly to assume they aren't human.   Three days into the war, Bush has finally, officially stated that this war will be prolonged. We have only seen the beginning of what may be a drawn-out conflict. Which is absolutely the worst possiblity that could happen to him. How has he gained his 70% approval rating in the country? By assuring the American populace that action in Iraq will be swift and results will be swifter. We will immediately oust Saddam out of power, all of his progeny, and all supporters of his outdated, suppressive, oppressive will. We will immediately institute a new, revolutionary, democratic regime that will restore a decent life for all Iraqis. But look at Afghanistan. We promised the same thing to them, we promised years of rebuilding and funding. Where are they now? Where is the US for them? Look at Cuba. Some help we've been to their smothered society. How about North Korea? They're starving and dying daily. What are we doing for them? Are the Iraqis really that much more important than other human beings? And the answer is no. They might all possibly be prioritized the same, had the same creed attached to them -- All men are created equal -- if only for the fact that Iraqi feet stand on the soil through which black gold flows. Bush may vehemently deny this point, but it is only because of this fact that he is sending our troops overseas so fast and so intensely. Why else did we secure Iraqi oil fields within a day or two of the start of this mission? I would hope that American lives are worth more than that.  Carlos Mencia said that people like to laugh, that it is what keeps us human, but that at the end of the day we should realize what real life is and appreciate it and make the most of it. You live only once, you have no restarts or refunds or exchanges for items of equal or lesser value. Indeed, Emily Dickinson once wrote, "That it will never come again/Is what makes life so sweet." Here in the United States we've been living in more or less a sheltered dream world for many years; this generation has not experienced the devastation of war, the agony of loved ones lost overseas in the defense of their country, the swelling of patriotic pride that comes when true, unmitigated victory has been claimed over the enemy. Most importantly, even with all of today's kids headed in the wrong direction, with our chronic and grave society-related problems that are causing an overflow of untimely death -- shootings, rape, robbery -- until September 11, until now, we have not fully understood the delicate fragility of life. Do we now? Has war really helped us in that one regard? I hope so, I pray for it. If nothing else, let the events of today remind us all how lucky we are for what we have, and how wickedly easy it could be to lose it. You've heard it before, you're hearing it again, and you will hear it endlessly for the rest of your lives...cherish those dear to you just that much more, only if because they can never be replaced. Their faults, their virtues, their silliness, their loyalty, their impossiblities, their pleasantries, their lives, their love. Because sometimes...

        9+ hours? Make that...uh...11 hours. (I was late, but don't tell anybody.) Yeesh. It was fun though. Very sunny and hot. (Because Jennifer was there.) And the time went by kinda fast. We have cool people on our team. Thi came, Ira and Richard visited...Erik, where were ya?   For such a rich school (all-weather track, fancy photo-finish cameras, loudspeakers) Newark Memorial has crappy bathrooms (no pun intended...uh...yeah). And they ran out of food after 2-ish...very disappointing. I was OK I guess...I stretched for roughly 5 hours per leg cumulative...my start is a little better, I got a 13.7 100 and 64.5 400. Improvement baby. There are some inhumanly fast souls in our world. They even beat 49 from Moreau! Wow. Thi told me about her exciting exploits involving nearly swiping Mr. O a credit card...yes, please don't ask. And because I'm now a track expert and all, "soon" in track (as in, "our event is coming soon") means "in roughly 5 weeks."  We have medalists on our team! Yes...our trusty girls hurdlers -- Jenny, Belinda, Kat and Jennifer (who nobly sacrificed the Chinese school that laid the foundation to their success and fame) -- won gold for shuttle hurdles. Good job guys. They won by a second and a half, which is pretty decent. It was a moment to savor. Then of course when they got their medals from Coach Beller, silly me took a picture of them with the shutter closed. AND that was the last picture on the roll...wasted. Sorry guys. Kat was kinda beat up on the shins, but she got her rightful royal treatment with blankets, ice, food, track bag pillows, bandannas, the works. All we needed was some incense and sacrificial lambs, and we'd be set. Belinda and Loan...and Jason...and Kristen...and Tammy...and David...all schooled me very badly in 13. It's a fun game. I'm just card-stupid.  We did pretty well, considering our greenness. Go Eagles! And all that.

         urlLink Freedom fries?  Ahahahhahaa...it's just kinda pathetic...   Damn I'm tired...meet tomorrow at Newark Memorial, 9+ hours...crap. I kinda sorta need to work on my history rough draft, oh well. I can't run the 400, and that will never change. And of course, the 200, which I actually somewhat enjoy, isn't gonna be at the meet. Kat and Jennifer (Jennifer Wong too? I'm not sure) won't be there for a good deal of the meet, Chinese school...without them, we might as well forfeit. How can we have a chance without our MVPs? :-D Erik might come and visit. Make sure to bring a very powerful shaver along. Just for him.   Richard...I'm just seeing a whole new side of him this year. He's become surprisingly friendly and helpful, and he is pretty damn athletic now. Far cry from his junior high days...except for the clothes, which are exactly the same. I mean, c'mon...he won the 400 individual medley!  Haha, the rally...totally forgettable except for Eugene, the proud tennis captain who was forced by Rudy to somersault all across the gym with a bad back and a dress with no sleeves and a shedding wig. He didn't get a girl, poor Eugene...though there were a few waving their hands wildly on the freshmen/senior side. Oh yes, they couldn't resist his wily charms. Then coming out of 4th period, we fought tooth-and-nail over who would leave class last. First, "Ladies first!" "Your mom first!" etc. Push came to shove, and we went no-holds barred. "I respect you more!" "No, I respect  you  more!" "You're older!" "No you're not, you were born a month before me..."  I had to pretend I was born in Vietnam for this girl Kim's English project. I don't think I can look myself in the mirror anymore. Ryan Tran...that...looks weird...

        Whee, I'm tired. Gotta love track meets. It's really not a bad experience. I'm not sure what the results were, but we were OK. I was pleasantly mediocre, but I really need to run more. We aren't exactly coached well.   Moreau kinda disappointed me. Sure, they're all rich and Catholic and uh..."powered by God"...but for $3,000+ a year tuition, they had a pretty lame team, track, clothes, etc. Except for this one guy who's nicknamed 49 because of his 400 time...I had what, a 69, and he ran a 52. Still damn impressive. Jason Koide's legs are just motors, he was awesome today. Good weather too. It's gonna rain soon though, damn...I'm actually kinda excited about our Saturday meet...yeah, I'm weird like that.  Rough draft due Monday for Lott? Mother...fucker. I dunked hella people in PE today...Adam, Parisa, Ahmer, Jason, Anna, Sarah, Kristy, Parisa, Anitra...a who's who of dunkees. Alex really got me good though. I couldn't get Ankur, he interpreted my attempt in a...different way. (Haha, Parisa's sandals were comfortable!) And boy, Richard is one slippery...boy.  Who's taking AP Bio?

Nothing much, I think I won in fantasy basketball...chem sucks...I ran a bit, got some weird pain in my chest and my breath sounded wheezy, I hope it's nothing...Legend of Zelda ROCKS!...I fixed Erik's computer after helping to break it...Michael Jordan was really good today, and the Lakers' white jerseys are tres uber.  Wow...that was pretty boring. Guess I had nothing much to write. Tonight was a lot better than last night.

         It wasn't that long ago  That something happened, I don't know Maybe it was another day, another week, another lifetime We walked together, hand in hand Without a care in the world  It wasn't that long ago in my mind Sitting there, side by side We could tell each other Anything Just because we could  It wasn't that long ago, but still We lost something, something special Or maybe we never had it Whatever it was, it's gone now Lost to that lonely world  The world of everything that could've been  It wasn't that long ago, wasn't so bad When we looked back at the times we had And though they were just small things A hello, a wave of the hand, a small smile We thought they would last Because they were ours But we were wrong  It wasn't that long ago, it's true That I was me And you were you And we were happy And that was all we needed But that has since faded away  It wasn't that long ago That I loved you

I spent 20 minutes sitting at my front steps cleaning my shoes...listening to birds chirping and feeling the breeze and seeing the blue sky...it was really peaceful. I liked it.    urlLink Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker !! AhHH!!  Hella people are sick right now, all the wind and stuff...and I'm coughing, meh...get better everybody.  I don't wanna swim. Too coold. And I hate history. Completely. And I don't wanna go to meets yet...too early! I'll suck.

         The sound of silence  I heard on our last night Stung me Hinted to me that something wasn't right What I did wrong, you know as well as I We used to talk and laugh But now all that has been replaced With emptiness, with nothingness With silence  The sound of silence I heard when you first walked away Broke me down Hurt me like nothing had hurt before And I tried to call back to you But you were already too far gone And my voice was drowned out With silence  The sound of silence I heard when I lost you Deafened me Dulled me to every other sensation But though I cover my ears I can still hear it And I can hear nothing else Except silence  The sound of silence I heard when you never came back Lashed my skin Woke me up from my hopeless dreams There's no turning back for us anymore You left me forever And all I have left Is the sound

        Ahh!! I got a comment from Parisa! Thanks. Wow...my life is finally complete...   After thinking it over, I still do think I'd prefer college over high school. Don't get me wrong, high school is fun and I like it and it's almost definitely easier, but it just feels like everything we do now is for the future. Tests, grades, sports, clubs, service...we don't do anything for the sake of doing it anymore, which is why I want college because all those obligations would finally be over (though there will be new ones like money and units, but whatever). That is why junior high was so good, because we still had no worries and we were old enough to enjoy it. But back in Thornton I didn't know 99% of you guys (cuz roughly .01% of Thornton graduates are in honors classes [Erik, represent! and Alex...kinda]), so I'm glad for high school because I know all you guys. And there's where we reach a pleasant little Catch-22: the more successful we are in high school and the better the college we are admitted into, the fewer of people we know who will be with us. Maybe we could all just turn stupid and go to Ohlone together :-D But that won't happen, and this inexorable parting of the ways is the bittersweetness of growing up. No, I'm mostly fine with it. I just wish I had more control over things.  The CAHSEE was OK, no big deal...I needlessly wasted a bunch of fancy words in my essay like amalgation, obfuscate, and rhetoric. Silly me. It was fun with Jason while taking the test, though he continually insists on making passes at me...uh, don't ask. Lunch, we haven't had any tournament games in a few days. Claire (who is also now officially one of The Guys) had a very sharp scarf on. Alex whispered some joke about it to Jason, but sadly I'm not Daredevil so I couldn't hear. I got locked out of the gym in PE. Yes, that's pretty sad.   Track was damn hard, friggin'...a million squats and lunges, then a million more squats and lunges, then frog-hops, then a million more...you get the picture. (Weirdly enough, the freshmen aren't that bad. Which kind of contradicts the definition of freshmen, but oh well. Can't believe we were once like them...) I live for after practice though...just hanging out with the hurdlers and badminton people and feeling that endorphin-induced post-exercise satisfaction. I like my spikes. They're cozy and they remind me of...ballet shoes? Except...blue and black Nike ballet shoes...with spikes!   Belinda dragged me into the girls' locker room against my will...nothing happened, nobody's privacy was violated or anything weird like that...I was expecting a lot more, but all they had were a bunch of really old and tall tall lockers. None of that rumored stank though. Whew. Still, it was...an experience not to be forgotten. Life-changing stuff, you know. There is no secret of the universe more sought after than...seeing the girls' locker room. Oh yeah. People like Erik think the secret of the universe is really donuts. That's a common misconception though, completely understandable. Pat was dying of lack of oxygen intake in the gym so he came outside to talk with me about science teachers with bad African accents who can't count and scare people after they run into poles. Then Alex and James and I talked about how oranges and stress cause pimples. Abdullah wrote "Jattman" on Tina's essay...yes, Simran's influence permeates everything. Then Alex and I walked home, and talked about something like...snapping off noses. Mhm.  On a completely unrelated tack, I sometimes feel the more people know me, the less they like me...or maybe it's just me...I don't know...

        Uhhh...I hate Mr. Lott. And homework in general. I'd just rather do this.   For some reason, college seems really enticing to me right now. Just the atmosphere, the activities and spirit (having a real reason to root for your basketball/football team), not to mention having an excuse to buy sweaters and hats and class rings and stuff. And burn my $4300+ worth of savings for college. Which really isn't a lot when you think about it. That'll be gone in...poof...a month or so. I need a job. But I don't wanna wear a dorky fast food restaurant uniform. Maybe if they had something sharp and flashy, like...jerseys and stuff. Then I would take half of minimum wage. As long as I could keep the clothes though. College would make me actually do my work on time too. Which is nice.   I don't like the uncertainty of what colleges I may or may not be able to go to. I want to know what kind of stuff would guarantee me enrollment, not have to conjecture on how many sports or clubs I would need to join to make it in. I just want to be in and...relax? Not in college. But even with all-nighters...midterms...it'll be worth it. Freedom...independence, all those cliches of finally "growing up"...but it's still something I want. Hopefully some of you guys come wherever I go...would be a very nice perk. Help ease me in. Being alone in such a big place would be...uh...lonely.   Sorry...that was worthless...and I lost five minutes that I could've spent on homework...oh well.   P.S.: Amita's birthday party was really cool. Good food...cool inflatable jumping house playset thingy (I beat Erik wrestling! Don't deny it), basketball practice, my first games of Twister, learning to skateboard, getting kneed by Richard...seeing some hella funny movies on the Internet ("don't forget the blue hair")...gotta love it.

       ahh why not...i haven't looked at this site for hella days now, but just seeing comments makes me want to write something again...thank you alex and thi...yes beller sucks and he plays favorites like a bush  lying from you is the best overall song on meteora...somewhere i belong has really good verses and numb has a sick hook...easier to run feels like a remake of my december and is not bad...nobody's listening is a fun song, nice lyrics that aren't bogged down by emotions or anything  yes hybrid theory was cool but...some songs were kinda indistinct and didn't stand out imo (points of authority, runaway, etc.)...in meteora the songs all have their own flavor...papercut is still their best song tho  meet today was alright...i have a sore hip so i had a 13.9 100 (i suck) but i got a 29.48 200 which isn't so bad...we actually beat mission in the pouring sprinkles...no thanks to the girls :-D i'm still flattered (on behalf of the track team) that people come and watch...ira...meenakshi...jenny...erik and pat (it's yellow-green, sillies...when is this strip badminton gonna start? haha)  i can feel myself slipping academically but i don't care...i have no motivation to study again, i am just posting on ankur's board instead or watching tv and avoiding work...lott's test was gay, i prolly failed becuz it is absolutely impossible to find 25 facts regarding the civilian effort to help world war 2...sykes quiz yesteday was gay, i spent 20 minutes on background and bs'ed a conclusion during passing but couldn't get a pass so i was late by 2 minutes for stupid mandarin for my 2nd tardy and mr miller called my dad that night to say i talk too much with eugene in class...gay  (papercut is playing now! cooool...i love winamp)  we got 3rd place in pe...events were boring...well, ankur almost slipped during the jump rope relay, quick reflexes tho...parisa has abs...ankur, adam and basho spent literally an hour thinking of campaign poster ideas for richard's run at asb vp vs. aurora...but sadly i cannot print them in a family-friendly website (see dick. see dick run. run dick run)...parisa didn't like that 2 much, she wanted something more like "richard is smart. vote for him"  we are finishing the matrix tomorrow (which i haven't watched in years, and i hope my mom will buy for me when she visits) and it's the start of spring break and it's the coldstone fundraiser (cheap plug) and we have 3 days of track practice next week from 5-7 pm (wtf!!??!) and hopefully you guys can think of something cool to do

       44 people online...wow. Hello all, just so you know I don't go home everyday and hibernate or something.   Spring Break...come, please! I'm just tired of everything again...school, track, guitar, games...ehh it's weird. I still want to be fast though.   I was going to put Alex Alex Alex all throughout this entry, but Alex would think I was stupid again or something.  Logan track meet was cool. I was really trying to pump myself for the 100, but I got only a 13.6. Blah. I won my heat though...of two people :-D Then I got a 29.42 or so for my 200, which is decent. It was hailing and windy as fuck though. Logan forfeited the last third of the meet, but we gritted our teeth, steeled our resolve and finished it. Haha no actually, Beller forced us to do the rest. Then we went to Tapioca Express, Tammy hitched me a ride and her mom made a left turn in a right turn only zone. Silly Asian parents. They also forced a strawberry pearl drink down my throat. OK, so they bought it kindly for me. Same difference. It was fun, we have a really cool team, that loves to...uh...read Chinese comic books.  Meteora is cooool. Buy it everybody. Become a proud Parker Brother! Hybrid Theory EP is the best though.

        in the warm california sun   now playing: blink 182 -- "first date"  ahh it's been a nice couple of days. saturday, nothing except playing pokemon. on an emulator...yes i kno i should feel ashamed. but i don't. too bad. it is teh shiznit0rz. sunday, my uncle and aunt took us to santa cruz. it probably was a good drive, i didn't know, i was asleep. odwalla drinks are nasty. way too thick. just like 2% milk, but my dad refuses to buy even 1%. my bro tried to reveal vital harry potter secrets from book 5 ("harry goes to school in england!"). stopped off at the boardwalk, got a cool red shirt (my first ever, unless you count the steve young jersey i got in 5th grade. oh memories...). man, sand is hot. especially under the sun. and water is cold. especially from the ocean. "uncle jack, go on the gondola carts." "no, that rope looks dangerous." "how can it be? look at all those people riding." "my point exactly!" then we drove up highway 1 and the picturesque ca coastline (it's even better when it's blocked by trees) and my uncle told me that the chinese invented rap.   today woke up at 9:45 (you don't kno how hard that is for me) to play basketball at school. no one was there, so i met joanna, adrienne, the krimkeviches, and tim teaching at the writing camp. owen's sister was there too. this little girl stole my ball and started dribbling better than me. finally amanda, audrey and tiffany came, and we shot around. amanda said her secret dream was to one day get an octopus stuffed animal. alex and kevin arrived, and alex airballed and hit amanda's thigh. we went to togo's where we rated how hot people were. amanda gave shane west a 7. paul walker? "o, 5, i don't really like white guys." alex: "but you gave shane west a 7!" amanda: "well i don't like pretty boys, and paul walker's a pretty boy." alex: "but shane west is the prettiest boy, he was in a walk to remember." amanda was stumped there. me, kevin and alex went to my house; kevin wanted to sleep but he was scared that alex would "rape [him] in the ass." alex even tried...but kevin woke up. haha.

        similes and metaphors   now playing: "i don't wanna" -- eminem  ahaha...i had an overall cool day today, like my first one for the whole summer break...holy crap this will be long, brace yourselves  i woke up with mei calling me to go to the movies, tho everyone else was busy...babysitting? who babysits in this day and age? we should have robotic guardians monitoring our movement, and sending off alarms to the nearest police departments whenever the children get out of hand...or...we could always shackle the kids. whatever's easier. but yea, so i ran to the bus stop. shivan at the ac stop was talking like..."what is going up today?" and laughing at me alot. the 10:53 bus was late, so i caught the 11:16 and got to the theater. nobody was there...bought a ticket, checked the theater, no mei, got a refund...bought another ticket, checked another room, no mei, got a refund...so i hopped over to best buy. animatrix...*drools* but i regained my composure and ran back to see mei had been waiting for 30 minutes. gah.   we watched charlie's angels 2 (she wanted to watch 28 days later also...i'd prolly have died or something). funny previews, tho i forgot them all. the movie was cool. mei seeing pink with black hair: "who's that?" me: "black." lmao carrie fisher as a nun, nice little inside joke. stupid: "then we got in a threeway and then we finally got her on her back!" we left during the credits ("there's an ember up my ass!") and ran into melissa tung (with jamba) and serena kwong (with matching jamba and spiffy new haircut to boot), which was cool. they got their grades already, lol yea its always chem that screws you up. jamba line was really long, and it's not even that good, really thick and doesn't help your thrist. on the way home i saw some black gangsters...then i saw some azn gangsters. all with jerseys and matching hats and shoes. bad fashion is colorblind...lol i'm going to get jumped now.   then i got home, my 29-year old cousin farand arrived. i introduced him to my aunt, who thought he was fred. farand was asking me what's hip with teenagers (asking me about hip things? that's like asking alex about democratic prez candidates' campaign platforms...) so i said girls think bald guys like mike bibby and the dude who plays lex in smallville are hot. we watched the hulk, which was really talky and took itself too seriously (no jokes. period. maybe one. and it sucked) and part of the opening was a lazy ripoff of spiderman and hulk looked fake and kevin and basho are right, the ending LICKED CHEESEWHIZ. OLD, DECAYED, TWO-WEEKS-PAST-EXPIRATION-DATE CHEESEWHIZ. but hulk rage. smash. kill. was cool. o yea, you kno society's going down the gutter when parents smoke with their children.  after that, i showed off a rubik's cube to farand, who said, "back in my day, we couldn't afford luxuries like rubix cube. we had playing cards, and matches, and the only thing cheap enough for us to do was to light random objects on fire and laugh maniacally as they burned ants to so many pieces of mush." ok so i made that up. i'm also going to la late july, to attend my mom's second wedding. since my mom's the youngest in her family, we were joking how her siblings were protecting her: "no, you cant marry him, he has a twitch in his eye! all you'll do for the rest of your life is stay home and cook for us!" then farand was like, "time passes by fast. i'm just so old now..." and then i said, "yea, the hours run through our fingers like so much sand in an hourglass." "o really now? has someone been watching soap operas?" "ahh, soap operas...just like so much better on toast."   cousins are the best.

        erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi   now playing: "the young and hopeless" -- good charlotte  haha...i'm only on ch. 16 of book one...man it'll be a month before i can read book five  responding to comments (thanks for commenting btw, guys, it keeps me writing...lol not like anyone wants me to keep writing anyway): i like lp and eminem. so what...ok then at '03 grad setup i was between an army duck and a...wannabe...i own you in street and ssbm, erik, don't deny it...i'd like to think i'm still an army duck-in-training :-D and i wanted to go to the party thingy, but my dad wouldn't let me cuz he was feeling excessively azn that night, same thing with chevy's...only complaint i had with book 4 was it was wordy, hopefully book 5 isn't the same, and haha ankur let's hope you find someone to insult soon, you might suffer from withdrawal...if my hormones dragged me to french club, why did i hang out with richard? (wait, don't answer that)  alright, my summer's pretty dull right now. we dropped my bro off to go to some band party thing in morgan hill (my bro out of the house past 10 pm *sniff* how he's growing up so fast...damn he's gonna be taller than me soon), then we got harry potter woot woot. soo big, but soo awesome. i even saw barbara pass by...haha that was cool, she was on vacation from diamond...something and i somehow ran into her. with that one guy me, alex, kevin etc. played football with during girls' tennis (not the white guy that broke kevin's finger and screwed him out of soccer).   today was ish except for going to owen's house to play games with the "homies" *simran's "it's monday f00!!" sign* i pwned with sheik, but got killed as dr. mario (damn owen and his samus charge shots). kevin: "it's not who you use, it's how you use him." kevin after dying first: "maybe it is who you use." timesplitters, nothing beats watching a monkey punch a player to death. "memory card? how about...forget card!" matrix, adam got excited about the niobe/persephone kissing scene but the rents were around. poor guy. viewtiful joe is REALLY FRICKIN COOL. it's matrix-y...except it isn't...almost worth buying a new gamecube just for the demo. bball was so funny but stupid, i felt really sluggish cuz of the extra sleep i've been getting, weird...erik tried to catch a ball that bounced in front of him and it hit him in the face...pat grabbed the ball and ran to the monkey bars, but he almost slipped off the slide...a boy was playing with an rc car and it fell into the tanbark so adam and kevin and me started spontaneously laughing...o yea, all you guys gotta come for a hypernet party. $3 an hour...so bring your life's savings or something.   then we left, and erik nearly forgot his hp book. how many people have harry potter: me, erik, jen, jenn, claire, amita (will), pat, kat, abdullah, ankur, jenny wu, elyse, joann, tina...am i missing anybody...o yea, and the rest of the general human population.

        harry potter strikes again   yup yup, harry potter and the order of the phoenix is officially out. erik, elyse, kat, jen, jenn, claire, even abdullah i heard are like dying about it. o, the stranglehold some people have over innocent children's lives...yea me too actually. must...read! but i didnt go to the midnight parties cuz i'm not a "harry potter dork" or nothing *cough*parisa*cough* lol...she's still in denial that's all...she claims she's just getting amita's book, but when she gets it, you kno why she'll be offline for days...  umm yesterday kevin woke me up at 11 to go to school to play bball with amanda, audrey, erik, abdullah and alex, but i didnt (sorry guys). the french club dragged me to help set up for '03 graduation. i raced tina to an overturned target cart...i won obviously. of course that had nothing to do with her having jeans and me having gym shorts. parisa was wearing capris and a sexy spaghetti strap to impress me and richard. or just richard. lol...mei doesn't like poles. i wonder why. you kno what some people do on poles...i mean using them to support canopies, it's kinda inappropriate really...then rico started licking alex's face. and then me and him and erik and kevin went to my house to eat food and play games (that's the only reason they hang around me anymore). alex with his crazy 23-dunk record when the games go up to 21...beat that! actually anyone can. erik thot he was really good cuz he won every game he played, but then we played in smash and i murdered him every time. except for the last game, where i faced the wrong way, fell off and died. maan, alex with pk flash, just like jigglypuff's rest, always gets us. we suck.   then we went to los cerritos to play bball for half a second, then me and erik went to graduation. my first high school graduation! yes, i'm sheltered. i was dressed like a program passer...outer...person...with white and black. belinda, kat, jen and claire all had the fo sheezy heezy sunglasses yo. i got a fuckin 89% in chem btw. so gay. if only i got those 6 pts i missed in the gas laws test for not mentioning it was vapor pressure instead of atm pressure...then we ran into pat, who me and erik followed like pets. while the band was (supposedly) playing, we were staring at butterflies flying upside down. and then we listened to names...something something catherine of something something...royalty! then the hp freaks (in a good way of course :D) went off to kat's house, leaving me and parisa and elyse to clean up alone. with two hot army ducks. score! haha...there was a bunch of free hats (i never actually saw hat-throwing before, and it was cool. but arent hats expensive? throwing away good money...), so i got to wear one. woot. i really wanna be a senior now and graduate and all that good stuff. parisa wanted a tassel and those bubble-blower things. the only reasons kids want to graduate nowadays, ya kno. me and matt returned the podium to mr johnson (he of the strangled chickens. rubber of course. i think...). then parisa started throwing leaves at me. and elyse complained that sumit wears the same boxers everyday. why does elyse look anyway...hmm...  yea that's all. ga...we should all go sumtime, that would be cool. and ira wants me to make her a new norah jones cd...aww, it'll take forever days...:(

        summer vacation...whee?   ah here we go again...man it really doesn't feel like break already. yesterday was like friday, today was like saturday...i should be goin to school in two days! aggh. man i won't see so many people...unless we all go to great america like daily. i got a wow card, cha-ching :-D haha marisa got cross-eyed in her pic...i havent blogged for four days? four days closer to harry potter, that means.  math final...mr o looking at belinda's yearbook pic: "did they give you too much air?" i tried to study with erik, but we couldnt do anything. so obviously he took my cd player. and alex played tons of videogames. my dad thought i played with him, so then he yelled at me for an hour about how i'm not conscientious enough. tuesday, chem...o well i got a b. again. good luck to next year's honors chem...you'll need it. after school, i hung out with jocelynn, jade, anna, and donny, and we went to carls' jr cuz jack was filled to the crack. (o i'm clever...yeaaa) played some basketball with alex and some chinese guys i didnt kno, and me and alex did a lil one on one, i had some decent drives, but i'm used to my neighbor's weak backboard so all of my bank shots went off too hard. then simulated some games of nba2k3, and we had like me, abdullah, sloan, jason (with a german moustache), and kevin (who had bright red hair and black sideburns) vs. alex, eugene, owen, erik (who had eminem's hair), and pat. sloan had like 9 points! and i was balling like crazy vs. alex, crossing him over so bad...eugene got this alley-oop that bounced off the rim but erik still caught it anyway. alex was like screaming when it was game point for my team and we missed, then his side would go for a two and they'd miss. then we won and he died. figuratively.   yesterday, pe...tough stuff. we won all three games, including a championship game over jacob's team...ANKUR...got in position to get a slow grounder and the ball went through his legs. ahhh its alright lol. brunch, i found kristen (who was diligently searching for me inside the cafeteria) and signed their yearbooks...with sharpie...breaking time-honored tradition :( eng, my essay, 2 1/2 pages double sided. i never write that much, besides like in these dumb entries, so that was cool. then i went outside and talked to jenn for the first time in like ever so i was happy. elyse, parisa and amita came, and elyse told me to hate adam forever for no particular reason. i went to the back and found adam and basho for hypernet. i got my ass royally smacked cuz i cant shoot without spraying worse than kevin a while pronouncing "babelfish pepperoni." alex kept on asking questions like "who's strider?" and i'd say "sam" then he'd go "shut up." then we played with pat oooh...5 months of ferrous oxide -- i mean rust was displaced -- arrgh, shaken off in 5 minutes...me and adam were beaten 15 to like 3.  today me, basho, alex, marisa, debbie, rajan, and camilla went to great america. first we went on top gun...we saw our pics and then decided to flip off the camera at every roller coaster. we passed the spongebob show and saw samyak and saagar. samyak pointing out people..."he's gay. he's also gay. she's too short. she thinks she's black. i just hate him." in the show he called at someone outside to walk in...and then they ran away. stealth, we kept our middle fingers up the whole ride, but the picture booth was closed! aww. the girls were talking...condiments, fake food; condiminiums, fake houses; condoms, fake...you get the picture. went on vertex...basho's seat was...wet, and sharon fell onto her harness a very bad way. "isn't it only suppose to happen to guys?" we finally flipped off the camera! my eyes are closed and my tongue's out, alex is starin at the camera with his hair lookin kinda spiked, and basho is evil. soo cool. alex bought an extra to sell on ebay or something. we even got sharon and kim on it too...blackmail...then we went on the sex ride. don't ask. a lot of teenage girls were on it, except they all went on a different part of the ride. coming home, we saw a "for sell" sign. yeup...  debbie's leaving for georgia (don't worry she wont get killed by the kkk or anything) and she'll be back on july 19. mark your calendars everybody. basketball tomorrow, owen's house sunday, my's party monday...busy. gotta love summer.

        happy father's day   indeed. well, i got my dad a rodgers and hammerstein cd, some slippers (not yellow duck ones sadly, but they're cushiony) and a card with fuzzy fabric on the front. everyone with younger siblings (mostly brothers), mine is absolutely shameless. he wouldn't even write anything in the card so i had to do it for him. then he wouldn't even present the gift to my dad...i swear...but yea, my dad was really happy and i was glad. it makes it more special cuz yea, my dad's mostly aloof and he never accept presents or whatever. he completely didn't expect it. what's funny is when i bought him his present yesterday at long's, when i was walking home wit my bro my dad drove by and i had to hide behind a hedge. ok, not funny. but still.  ahhh what a lame game 6...nets had the lead for 3 and a half strong quarters but then the spurs bust out with a 19-0 run and tim duncan almost gets a quadruple-double (!) to become finals mvp. go david robinson, he's comin out on top with a 2nd championship like john elway. speedy claxton was HELLA good these last couple games...kenyon martin sucked, jason kidd was alrite but fell apart at the end. i feel sorry for him, cuz he was so close...but oh well, maybe next year with whatever team he joins. (subliminal message) sign with the warriors! (/subliminal message)   o yeaa, on another note...charlotte bobcats what the FORK. i've lost all respect for their naming crew, and i don't even kno them. and no more HSEE! the july test was canceled, and cuz they'll say kids didn't have all chances possible to make it up it will prolly be removed as a graduation requirement for 2004. who cares, we all passed anyway haha.   ...didn't we?

        not much of a weekend    I'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave cuz your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone these wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase when you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears and I held your hand through all of these years but you still held on me   anyway yeah, so far a rather ho-hum weekend. Darn obligations and all that. (stupid word automatically capitalizing first words.) They can add words to the dictionary, so why not get rid of them? What a nasty word, "obligation." It implies being told to do something. Who likes to be forced to do stuff? Why not make it something pleasant...like..."gobblegook." Happy connotations.  Well, yesterday wasn't too bad. science was COOOO000o00o0L. first they blew up moles which was excitingly underwhelming. Then she lit some methanol...wha-POW. Everyone slid back about 20 seats cuz we were scared we would die on the last week of school. Coolest thing we've done all year...but that's not saying much. Mandarin, we got awards...I got the "turning around to talk to someone else the most" certificate. W00t. and mrs. Howell is gonna teach mandarin 3 next year...noooo, we can't mess with the icky freshmen -- I mean sophomores from mandarin 2.   after school, Stephanie fok was jumping out of her clothes like she got electrocuted cuz she took a picture with that "asian version of ben Affleck," but he was staring at the camera like it was a panoramic pic or something. then I went with tammy, Kristen, Nicole, Jason, david, tasha, and jenny to watch finding nemo. I saw a 3000gt, again...they're everywhere. You almost see them more than supras. David has a bunch of b's, but he's like, "I don't care cuz it's freshman year." Oh, the state of youngsters in society today. O yea, one word to the wise, if you want to pay someone back for buying your movie tickets -- esp if it's a girl -- do NOT put the dollar in their pants pocket. The movie was alright, but I thot marlin? was pretty frickin annoying. The short in the beginning with the snowman and the hot mermaid, almost like the Lipton Ice snowman or something. And the scarred fish...Green Goblin!  Then I got home after learning that asian parents would rather drive off a cliff than drop you off more than 10 feet away from home than humanly possible. I called alex, and he stopped by with his fan club of Amanda, tiffany, and selena. They stared in awe as alex busted crazy chords on the guitar, and gasped in terror as he licked an action figure on its painted lips. But yea, Amanda says "he's always horny," so whatever. And Eugene and erik, whatever I typed to you, that was really tiffany. Honest! Kristin kreuk isn't THAT ugly. Then alex busted out on my brother's recorder. It was almost like listening to beethoven's ninth reinvented. Played on a recorder. By someone who hasn't used it for about 5 years. I caught Amanda starin out of my window serenely...prolly just checkin out guys or whatever. I don't blame her, maybe she expected me to go walk outside or something :-D then we played street and Amanda and tiffany got brutalized. I was disappointed, where was amanda's legendary bball instinct? Or something like that. Then I played alex and he beat me. Fluke! Yeaa. That's about it for yesterday.   Then today I just bought my dad's father's day gift, and skipped the car wash. Sorry guys, but yea I thot it wasn't as important. Weird, but I've never given my dad a real father's day gift before, so I felt I might as well do it now. And I went to hypernet with adam, basho, josh gerber, and the famed "jake" (moriaki). I never knew he was asian. Then I got awped so many times that I memorized every death animation. Ok, I'm kidding there. Adam's pretty good at awping for somebody who only plays at pat's house. Maybe he lives there during summers, dun dun dun...  Played some basketball tonight, and that's about it. O yeaa...harry potter and the order of the phoenix countdown...one week! =O

        "kid-like!"   if only everybody had their own lifetime supply of bing cherries, it's almost as good as world peace...plus a tad bit more filling.  if you guys kno anna aguilar, she's moving to san diego this summer...never to return? the school will be a little emptier...  man, it was frickin cold today. who turned back the calendar 6 months? we're supposed to be coming up to summer vacation, not christmas break. i can almost here the carols again...no wait, that's my brother's flute...a lot of yearbook signing today. my was the first to sign my yearbook, and she wrote somethin like "you should of joined badminton!" i gleefully pointed out this minor error, and then she cheerily noted that i misspelled her name "mai." silly me. math final wasn't bad, i was really surprised cuz the proofs (esp. the last one) were rather easy. but apparently we got different versions of the proofs. maybe i was just lucky like that.   focus, went to the link thing. HOLY CRISSCROSS there was a lot of wannabe link leaders. i guarded elyse and jen liu's precious belongings with my life...or at least my right shoe. mandarin, heather's a prime example of why freshmen are unconditionally worthless. she couldn't hear what i said cuz i have a strong accent...likely story! (actually she's right. oh well.) stopped by in creger's, where erik said in his creed that i was one of his two best friends...damn...that hella means a lot...yea sometimes he can be mean-spirited, but he always means well. and tina caused "half the class" to cry in her presentation, but she wouldn't explain why. (would it involve onions? lol jk) and jen chien also cr -- er, created a beautiful display for her creed. i only saw the outside, but it looked real cool. she forgot amita's pencil sharpener tho! and my peanut butter jar. she signed my yearbook, and talked with me if only for a few minutes...it's just the small things.  eng, whooped in the vocab game, then followed debbie and anitra to madame so anitra could read her fashion show stuff. mei was there too, she wore like platform shoes to feign tallness...worked somewhat. she had to redo her entire speech, but her french sounded cool. not like it'll be useful in life but hey, whatever works. debbie thinks cuttino mobley's hot. don't ask. and she's going to georgia over the summer...let's hope she survives. they left, then nicole (she of the huge pic in the yearbook showing off her pixelated photogenicness) condescended (vocab!) to hang with me as she went on a vain, hopeless search for tammy and kristen. she worried that they were kicked out of the activity center, but who would dare kick out appointed class officers? they're like...on a separate plane of existence beyond that of us mere mortals.   i went home and played street. biggie little was really easy to get. 5'4" and 90 lbs? what kinda boss is that. man the comp cheats so bad, they pack me like no one's business (even tho stretch has a crown in dunks but you kno how stats don't matter). they have people with 3/5 in dunks constantly slamming it over me. whatever, right now my team consists of me, stretch, biggie little, allan houston, and mike bibby. not too bad.   am i allowed to listen to b2k? not like i do or anything.

       wow, are you happy now video is very nice...and only 9 mbs! gotta love wma format.   my brother was actually really nice today, he let me have the yearbook that he was supposed to have for this year (and his soph and senior years too. darn little brothers. their daddies luv them). then he let me have the internet too. ok, so he was sleeping, but still it's the thought that counts. (or lack thereof.) yearbook is crazy...just how many people's pictures look exactly (or almost) the same as last year? pat, owen, jen liu, jason koide, basho, adam...p. 76 look-alikes, poor siegel haha. he had even bought contacts so he wouldn't look like him. (he was close to getting fired from his ga job cuz some lady in an oscar meyer weiner hat complained about him.) o well.   this yearbook is much nicer than last year's, which was like they hired elementary school kids to make it. but in the girls' jv bball pictures, it shows amanda, audrey, and lindsay anderson in the EXACT same pose for a baseline jump shot, but it says audrey's trying to shoot, amanda's trying to pass, and lindsay's trying to dunk. huh? then alex in badminton: "alex chang attempts to make a crisp and accurate serve by using his outstanding skills." (the pic was taken during open gym, like the first time he ever played.) and quote of the year (about dating in high school): "it's good. it helps you for future dating."   history. long. lame. lott (aka v.i. lenin): "what form of music was invented in the early 1900s in new orleans?" mike: "country?"   watching the nba finals...go nets! altho tony parker has been schooling jason kidd lately. you kno how malik rose slammed the ball in dikembe mutombo's face? today in the first qtr, stephen jackson swiped it from jason kidd then passed it to tim duncan who MISSED a dunk, then rose got the rebound, went for a dunk and was SWATTED by mutombo. the french commentator was going "ooh la la"...then richard jefferson over kevin willis, my oh my. and speedy claxton's layup to end the 3rd qtr...  that one asian girl in the show fame, like she was wearing some red top on monday night? wow. and the asian dude? wow...his face looks old.  thanx owen, but don't worry about it. if i didn't get a position, i didn't get a position. that's how things go. and o yea, amita has a 90%? just 4 days after she had a 95%? that's why mrs sykes is bs. pish posh to all you who have her next year...which may include me actually  i wanna make the senior slideshow. for some reason, designing things (art and style-related, not like architecture or clothing) interests me. anyone think p.o.d. -- "thinking about forever" and good charlotte -- "the young and the hopeless" would be good?

        you took all there was to take and left me with an empty plate and you don't care about it and i am giving up this game and leaving you with all the blame cuz i don't care   love that song. i like michelle branch. so sue me. (actually, please don't. i'm poor. sue my brother.)  anyway yea, it's been another damn long time since i've updated this poor little excuse for a blog. thi and owen say they like it (thanks guys, that means a lot), and they want me to go back with it...silly thi, assuming that i would write again just for her sake. actually, she was right. i wonder if i'll be able to update daily again. but considering how much time i've been playing nba street vol. 2 (BEST GAME EVARR), i might be able to manage. (i OWN erik and alex in street. thank you. tho alex can consistently wipe the screen to a sparkling finish with my remains in timesplitters 2.) i've also seen a lot of people using xanga...i refuse to give in! no more bandwagoning for me. not like i ever bandwagon. yeup.  let's see what i have to update. um, i've recently downloaded a lot of new songs...work it remix (missy f/50 cent), my immortal (evanescence), are you happy now? (mechy? michy? bah), if you're not the one (daniel bedingfield...what a lame name, how can you make a football team called the bedingfielders?), not in my house (nelly...from the best game evarr), etc. (btw, that stupid dj in the background of rap songs goin STREET SWEEPERS and DRAMA HOUSE...what a fruit. let us illegally download in peace!)  i have a b in chem, but our final is worth 15% of our grade. cha-ching. now if i can just study a year's worth of material (no, make that roughly 2 months considering how much we actually learn in that class) in 7 days. btw, wtf kinda teacher takes off points for not writing your last name (sumit g? o hmm, i wonder who that is...) or the date? yea, cuz you know how teachers rely on their kids to tell them what day of the week it is. then she takes off a point for not showing how you came up with the partial pressure of a gas after subtracting vapor pressure...die sykes die die die die  gj to leo and kevin ho and anthony and all those ppl working on the mural across the cafeteria. it's...yellow and...different, but very well done.  hmm, i suck. my basketball skills are limited at best and i was terrible vs. alex and kevin in 21 (much like my drawing, which i haven't practiced in forever), i didn't win any officer positions...oh well. what do i look forward to everyday? good question...trying to prove i'm not completely hopeless. but to whom? my 5th grade teacher who made me co-editor of a class newspaper...mrs. t, who inexplicably thinks i'm a good writer...my cousin angela who laughably thinks i'm going to berkeley. i really like my cousins but it's hard to talk to her irl, even tho we sometimes chat a lot on aim...in person she's always with her mom, and i never decide to bother her. it's easier to hang with jill (her sister), who goes to ucsd...she says beware of the quiet people, they are the ones who get their freak on the most when drunk and stuff. (why are you all looking at me like that?) she also says we're lucky to be in high school...college is a killer. and that the tolerance of small asian girls for tequila in "tj" is bottomless.  a couple weeks ago at la for my grandma's 90th birthday bash...ping pong is fuuun. now if only i were good...story of my life.  happy belated birthdays to...melissa tung (don't get me drunk plz! thankies) and elsie. (who is this elyse i hear people talking about?)

        it is better to break a man's leg, than to break his heart   whee...another week of humid los angeles down the wazoo...lots of 9 am tennis (new racket! a prince...ehhh could be better...babolat power!), internet, reading, sleeping, and absolutely no cool la things accomplished. no concerts...no partying (or, as they say in the streets, pardon my ebonics, "clubbin")...well we checked out a beach and it had palm trees. that was cool. saw lots of rich people with their vipers, 13" powerbooks, more odysseys than you can shake a sienna at...one parking lot had an mr2 spyder, 350z, AND s2000 all together. swam a little bit in our OLYMPIC SIZE swimming pool...with a TEN FOOT diving board...me and ankur think it might make a decent senior trip. who knos. o yea, i'm writing this in the dark right now, the others are sleeping, shh dont tell jen...she'll think i'm being brainless and dumb again. accordion buddy! haha...nah.   coolest part of the trip has been hanging out with cousins. all two of them. well, there's a bunch more, but they're all 30 and working so they have no time for poor lifeless me. so i first managed to play tennis with farand, he of the 29 year oldness, and he beat me in basketball. but i had only 6 hrs of sleep, so bah. had to help my mom look for a wedding dress, we looked in kohl's...pointless. frickin cheap tho...$10 for polo (the brand) shirts! wtf! read a lot of newspaper...sorry, the pic online ISN'T kobe's accuser, tho they revealed her name on talk radio. recall stuff, liberia stuff, piatkowski to rockets stuff. library...omg...it has a gift store, imacs like crazy, restaurant, mini-museum with green screen and plasma tvs...across the street from high school...WHY DID I MOVE!! then seabiscuit...good movie, tobey maguire cusses alot...it is basically all TRUE. read the book. good book. ate at hof's hut, my brother thought it was olive garden. silly brother, he wants to eliminate lunchtime clubs and suvs, and hates harry potter cuz he gets angry. we talked a lot tho today. it was good.  today was fun, went bowling with cousin jill (she said she was busy with nothing), she of ucsd. apparently classes in uc's curve so the class AVERAGE is a c...so it's really cutthroat and people laugh cruelly as their fellow students get their skin eaten alive by .2 molar phosphoric acid. earlier she went to downtown disney for a friend's bday party...imagine the humility if she had to get dropped off. "umm...that was my chauffeur...my, um, jaguar's still in the garage, getting, um, a 4th exhaust pipe installed..." first game, in our sharp red/black/white bowling shoes, i bowled a 78, but jill got a 71 to cheat me out of last place. my bro got a...137? pwah! he had a celebration dance...you don't wanna know. mom got 134, she used to be in a bowling league. 2nd game, i found my mistake (step too close to left) and got a 132. that's cuz jill got a strike for me. and the pins didn't reset after one frame, so i got a 3rd roll! bro got...104-ish, mom was 130?...jill got 70. it's ok, cuz she can drive and take pictures and she has awesome sunglasses. mom's like..."wow that's jill? isn't she stunning?" "mom...she's my cousin..." then dinner, had japanese food, talked about reality shoes. yup, i did it again. shows. don't watch banzai! their japanese accents are so bad, they kinda sound british...and that's about it.

        it's the humidity stupid   i am currently here in good old la...it's hot and humid, eggs are cooking on the sidewalk, hair is burning off scalps...and that's at 9 am in the morning. yea it's pretty bad. makes it hard to play tennis. nothing too exciting except in the airport i left my ipod in my pocket during security check-in (everyone now has to take off their shoes...haha...we will wreak terrible havoc with our socks of unmitigated stink) and they told me to wait in a separate line. then some old viet fob dude used the metal detecting wand things to search me...hella funny. it catches the freaking button on your jeans. yea, a 16 year old kid with an ipod is really a threat to national security. sigh. our priorities are so misplaced.  anyway besides that...umm...i wanna watch bad boys 2. poor alex, too bad he couldn't go. o yea, my mom has a cellphone and it's really cool to use. and i sadly admit my brother is really cool when he has no stupid political ideas to argue about. and i can jump higher than him. that's automatically a plus in my book.  loooowwww... sloooowwww... gooooo... flooooo... sirens... ding

       i'm about to leave for la tonight at 9:30 pm, rather soon after tahoe. i'll be there till august 4, so go ahead and celebrate...haha. we might go on a cruise...beach...weird stuff like that. my cousin has even offered to drive me anywhere i want. i hear tijuana is nice this time of year...anyone want "i love ryan" shirts? just a thought (thank you kevin). no? i can get 'em dirt cheap...i wonder why...  o yea, kobe bryant has been indicted on felony  urlLink charges of sexual assault , and he's admitted in a statement to making " urlLink the mistake of adultery ", but he and his wife deny any criminal wrongdoing. although the media circus is completely unwarranted and even shameful -- c'mon, it's adultery, it's not a crime and it happens all the time -- and i think the girl possibly seduced him for his money, it's still a very stupid move to do. kobe's got so much to lose...a crystal reputation, legions of fans, a young family, and millions of dollars...why did he do it?

        honey, i'm home   yay, finally back from 4 nondescript days in tahoe. it was a nice change of pace...getting murdered in capcom v. snk, ogling at ddr xtreme version 7 2nd mix session 12 volume XVIIIAGH, laughing at a firefighting game where your weapon is a fire extinguisher, sighing miserably at soul calibur II, gagging at the crappiness of mixmania (or whatever the turntable game is), laughing some more at a guy who memorized songs of beatmaniax (the raving game) to show off...and that was just the arcades.  it was nice though rather hot for tahoe, hovering around upper 80s, and filled with construction for the upcoming winter season (only 13 million short seconds away!). minakshi (who lives across the street from me and shares my birthday, a coincidence i will never understand...or maybe there are no coincidences...o whatever, signs sucks anyway) said it would be boring as hell, and she was half-right. i spent hours watching whose line, sportscenter, smallville (haha maybe eugene does have a point), crappy jewel videos...the gondola was expensive, slow, and hot...mountains were all murky-colored...pressing the self-opening handicap doors was amusing, as was pushing metal doors after dragging your feet on carpeted casino walkways for endless hours (bzzt)...at least the drive around the lake was rather picturesque, as we listened to rush limbaugh fill-ins on the radio. i've got pics to prove it too. what else, i've got nite brite, scores of unbridled yearbook crappiness, graduation...did i ever tell you how much thornton grad licked popsicle sticks? 90 degrees of misery on our OWN track hanging with alex...ah the memories. but i digress. i saw an mr2 spyder and a ferrari! soo beautiful...*dies*  o yeaa...tonight is the espys. nominees and presenters get a gift bag with a ps2, games, a diamond ring, and a free jamba a week for a year. not bad, eh?

        urlLink Personality Test : Like just 10% of the population you are a HELPER WHO FINDS MISSING CHILDREN OVER THE INTERNET (Submissive Introvert Concrete Feeler). You are very tentative in the world and introverted with people--which means you are the shy and silent type. Hence the Internet. But behind your reserved exterior lies a dedicated person with a passion for the concrete truth who wants to, in his heart of hearts, help find missing children. God bless you.  urlLink Un-telligence Test : Sorry about the bad news. For the record, you are: 43% Un-telligent! which is significantly lower than the current average of 60%. Here is the report of your personality that led our team of geeks to conclude that you are hopeless in the pursuit of manhood:   "The subject shows a very high level of intelligence, and his sense of observation is one of his best qualities. He shows a lot of potential, but that's only part of the equation. Also, as much as we hate violence, an occasional mauling is one way to solve day-to-day problems like unpleasant coworkers or pesky door-to-door salesmen; he just isn't tough enough, sir, and he avoids any solution that involves violence. Finally, the subject displayed a poor (and a little boring) sense of humor, a fair and productive sense of morality, and a lack of self-confidence."  urlLink Pickup Test : You are 45% pickup-able! You're like Jen. Do you know my friend Jen? You're just like her�she's like this cool girl who's attractive and funny. I should call Jen. Or maybe you're like my friend Steve. Regardless, you like to flirt, but not with ugly people. And when you lock eyes with the right person, you know how to turn the sparks into a towering inferno. But sometimes you won't give people the time of day, which is mean when they really need to know what time it is. In general, make sure you smell good.  urlLink Inner Child Test : Your inner child rides you like the hollow donkey that you are, for it is the Li'l Dictator (Normal Spoiled Functional Adult). Brutal, cold and demanding, he rules you with an iron diaper. He recites long speeches of your demise, herds the emotions together in detention centers and generally just makes any pleasure you may have punishable by firing squad. In order to help yourself, the first thing you need to do is revolt, coup or all out assasinate the little bugger. Perform psycological warfare on him. You may get lost in the struggle for independence, but future generations will sing your name. Stay away from open balconies, though. He likes to push.  urlLink Dateable Test : Damn, Rico! You are 71% dateable! Attractive and confident, witty and charming, a healthy ambrosia-based diet...you're wanted in the 48 contiguous states, you slayer. Call me. Seduce me. Make me a woman (or man.) Not only do you know how to turn a girl's (or guy's) engines on, but you also know how to oil, lube and rotate it. You put the "elation" back into "relationship," and the "night" back into "one-night stand."  urlLink Best Friend Test : Joyous trumpets and champagne supernovas! You are 71% rock-solid friend! The Three Musketeers. The Three Amigos. The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse? You belong, dude, you belong! Some people put their neck on the line for their friends; you put your ass on the line. And by the way, nice ass. People know they can count on you in a crunch, in a jam, and in other food metaphors describing times of desperation. You give the gift of hope, but more importantly, you give the gift of kidney. Your rewards in life will be great, or at least better than other people's. To quote a fortune cookie: "You are soon have a fortunate experiences." Damn you  urlLink Spark ! Damn you!

        sour grapes   umm last few days were kinda cool, hung out with kevin and alex and alex's "freshmen fan club" from badminton (kim, natasha, sindy, gayzel, june...actually i'm not sure they're all his fans and i'm not sure they're all badminton). we played tennis. alex hates tennis. walked around alot, ate stuff, almost pushed sindy off a swing, watched gayzel fall of my bike...it was fun. i also played basketball with amanda, audrey, pat, ankur, erik, and alex. i was late as usual, no surprise. pat, erik and ankur all bought 2L bottles of sunkist. then it was tennis with alot of the girls' team and owen. i tried to climb the fence...took me about five minutes to get down. we saw jenn working at the water center next to albertsons, she tried to chase me and alex away...that was cool. and o yea, nobody agrees, but i think natasha looks like kristin kreuk. somebody believe me!  next week i am going to tahoe in some two-room suite hotel thingy...weird...maan it's hard to ski when there's no snow.  you guys don't realize how disappointed i am in harry potter 5. it was sooo good, fresh air in the dursleys with a pitiable dudley and a deeper petunia...ron a prefect and keeper...fred and george's awesome escape...new facets of james, lily and snape's relationship...harry's newfound (and imo, justified) anger...dumbledore's rebelliousness...i was actually both jumping out of my seat and looking around furtively with inexplicable fear...now don't get me wrong, it is easily more cleanly written and funnier than book 4, but then the ending comes and depresses the crap out of me like book 4 could not. i was ready to rank the book up there with #3, but (spoiler alert, but i don't really care) harry happens to be a thick prat and basically throws away the girl of his dreams for over two years just cuz he can't get a hint when he's supposedly smart enough to fight voldemort. stupid stupid. that left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended...haha. then there was no real revelation in the book (quirrell, riddle, time-turner, crouch jr)...an interesting last battle with harry shunted to the side and nothing gained...load of new pointless characters (tonks, luna)...the absolute WORTHLESSNESS of neville...hagrid's stupidity with grawp and grawp's hurriedly-written justification for existence...umbridge, filch and FUDGE not getting near enough recompence for their faggotosity (i literally hated them throughout the book, and they end up unscathed)...and i will say it, the death was somewhat anticlimactic and unworthy of such an important character. just like terminator 3, why has a very worthy story ended up as a setup for a sequel? even the prophecy didn't seem to carry as much weight. this is the danger of writing a series like this; as inspiration continually crawls its way into rowling's head and stretches out the books' lengths, the inherent folly of a seven-chapter series will rear its head: harry potter won't graduate from hogwarts into we are well into college. why? my only hope is book 6 will come soon, and that it will tie up the mountain of unsatisfying loose ends of the order of the phoenix.  that is my interpretation of the book, happily (or unhappily, depending on your personal opinion of the book) free of warnings of what i was about to write. i'm sure few of you agree with me, and i don't mind. for 790 pages, i was reading literary perfection...i'd like to know if i am the only person who believes the last 80 were anything but.

        weekend update   ehh...might as well talk about my last few days after all, it's not like I have anything better to do...  great America was teh r0x0rz. it was me, erik, sloan and alex...delirium looks lame but it's actually fun. centrifuge is CRAP. if we wanted that much spin we could've watched one of ari fleischer's press conferences...whoosh. on logger's run, alex pulled erik in a warm embrace for the pic. or just grabbed him, whatever. alex dropped his cellphone on invertigo, right in the fenced area. then we met up with kat (say hi to sloan-ee for me), kat's coz, jen wong, Jason pak, devika (who thinks Jason is some mighty fine stuff), mansi, wo jiao alex bermillo and some freshmen guys. back to top gun, siegel was working! some dumbass apparently pressed the "e-exit" button so it shut down for 5 minutes, he got fired. then siegel's shift was over, but he couldn't stay with us cuz he could've gotten fired for talking. we split up before the inner tube thingy (sorry kat). invertigo is hella cool when you're on the edge...we saw alex's phone over. and over. and over. we nearly drooled...er, it clearly ruled. we went on top gun a 4th time, I said, "I'm starting to get bored of this ride"...sloan: "I wanna go again!" grizzly/demon/triple play/vortex/orbit blew. but drop zone is THE BEST. EVAR. at 8 pm invertigo closed, this really cool guy told us to wait a little bit for alex's phone...maybe half an hour...eh, you can go sleep. we wanted to jump the fence and get the phone but he said terrible things happen, you get the police, the media, you're sent to jail, sentenced, just cuz of a phone. but alex got it in the end.  fourth of july...went to the parade at warm springs. hella people for its 3rd year, no celebrities tho. not even Kristi yamiguchi...shucks. saw our band, rigo chacon (abc7 news! he had a mic and everything), some Scottish people swordfighting in kilts, and some pirate lady going: "can I buy that thar child from ya? two bits, or one?" then I went to the nhs car wash. there was one squeegee. what kind of travesty is that, a carwash with one squeegee. it's like...a house with one tv. or something. the lazy juniors let some guy wash his own car. yeaa rita! but I ain't trippin. we made over $200 total, not so bad. tam was thinking of doing paintball for a fundraiser later...that's...unheard of! Joanna was going around, "do you want to donate to support breast cancer?" and you wonder why people didn't donate, besides, guys dont relate to breast cancer silly...lol then jack London square that night, we passed by Melissa Shinto! she was on the phone though. off went the fireworks. some annoying AS HELL kids were going ooh! wow!! after every firework, even the crappy ones. smiley face! flower!...I wanted to throw them into the bay. the end was crazy, they set off 20 fireworks at the same time for half a minute. san Francisco, eat your heart out...alex: "well I was at great America so fuck YOU!"  yesterday ate at del taco (where arby's used to be) and used three coupons. for one meal! only my dad...then terminator 3. it was good, it all made sense. lots of random carnage, which is definitely helpful. "talk to the hand!" funny stuff. the naked chick: not too bad...naked ahhnold: ahh my eyes my eyes my eyes

        absolute hate   just skip this post if you want, i don't mind...i'm sorry, i'm just so completely pissed right now.  i hung out with erik and alex today. it was fun. i don't fuckin care anymore. i go to get a drink in the garage, my dad yells, "close the door!" i leave to play basketball and come back, "put the ball away!" i try to talk to him about t-3 (which he has wanted to watch for months) and he doesnt say a word. a kid threw his ball into our backyard, i use my brother's 3 year old shoes like slippers, my dad doesnt say ANYTHING about me being nice, just that i fucked up my brother's shoes. my brother takes my dad's side as always, never mind that he doesnt ever listen to my dad whenever it's his ass thats getting jumped on. o, we need to fly to la? lets just delay in my room for an hour and almost miss the flight and make my dad scream his lungs out to try to get me. o, dad needs to talk about what kinda crappy kids we are? lets just talk back to him for 15 minutes and watch as i dont get punished. o, ryan's getting punished for doing almost nothing? let's take dad's side! dear spineless little brother.  then my dad says, o! from now you better not waste your drinks on your friends. sure i drink 2 1/2 and alex drinks 2 1/2, nevermind they're FRUIT drinks that expire soon, nevermind we HAVENT drunk any before, nevermind it's NOT soda or something unhealthy, i better not drink any. then he says he bought ice cream bars, but he hid them in the bottom shelf of the freezer so i cant give them to my friends! alright, now he cant fuckin trust me anymore. what do i care if i get a b in chem, it's not like he would act any different than if i get an a...o, great, straight a's, i expect you to always have them from a lousy school like this. you get a b and you're a failure. now i dont care if your brother has a b cuz he's the precious little brother that always talks back and never gets punished. but if it's you, o tough luck.  so i try to calm myself and take a nap cuz i'm NOT talking back. my dad wakes me up to do the dishes. i'm doing the dishes then my dad yells to my bro, "i was angry at ryan, now i'm angry at you!" ok, alright, be angry at me when i didnt do anything except sit there and give a neighbor his ball back...then i go to my room and my dad barges in and creates a bunch of ridiculous rules that i dont even fuckin care about. "all your friends are out by 6! even if aunt amy and uncle jack come over, they have to be out by 6." what the FUCK, they left at 6:05. and ok fine, be a bitch to your sister as long as it creates a clear example. "don't be loud." i closed my GODDAMN door when we were inside it. "make sure your friends take their shoes off and put them in the right place." WTF THEY DID. trying to find blame where THERE's NO BLAME TO FIND, when i'm the one that cooperates and my brother never does...i just want to call him so many things...right now i'll just settle for failure. failure to stay with my mom, making my mom's family constantly worried about her...failure to raise my worthless little brother right, so he lashes out at me...failure to be involved with my life, so i'm talentless and shy...bastard.

        they never knew what hit them...   boy today has been exhilirating. downloading songs, watering plants, killing ants...how can it get any better? actually it was kinda cool, my dad yelled at me to get to watering the plants when i actually OFFERED to do it instead of my lazy-ass brother who sits on that lazy ass all day playing soul calibur II, so i went outside and i saw a line of ants just milling in a crack on a sidewalk. so i flushed em out with my handy-dandy hose, and the sidewalk was literally inundated with their miniscule forms of terror. then i busted out the ant spray, and left a wake of destruction that human eyes may never lay eyes upon again. exciting.  dear god, will you listen to my dad screaming his head off. unbelieveable. i spend a good 20, 30 minutes of yardwork just to make his life a little easier and what happens? my dad yells bluddy murder cuz the HOSE WASN'T PUT AWAY CORRECTLY. what. the. hell. then he says it would be better if i actually did sit around and accomplish nothing. can't i get any goddamn respect from my own father. whatever.

        gay-c transit   umm today went to the movies with the family to see swat again...uptown girls? psht. we've already had a lot of filial tensions...those will need to be worked with. like not wearing the same flip-flops, laughing at ugly wow card pics, name-calling, you name it. swat was worth seeing again, then natasha and sindy jumped into bad boys 2 (right when it started, which was cool), they sat in the special chairs underneath the staircase, me, alex and gayzel were in the 2nd row. loud, funny, and way too long. then they grabbed some in-n-out while i waited and rummaged thru gayzel's purse, then i left to try to get on ac but i waited for 2 FUCKING HOURS cuz only one 210 came and it DROVE PAST ME. FAGGOT DRIVER BITCH. eventually at 8:20 i came back to krispy kreme, bought 2 75 cent donuts cuz i thot i needed 50 cents for a call, cuz of tax i got 35 cents so i bought another donut to get an extra quarter and threw the dime away so i had 2 quarters, but i found out calls are 35 cents. damn. called, waited in front of the theater, saw dorian! so i inexplicably went to hide, i came back and WTF, alex came running to me in a weird kinda-sorta-not hug thing. i said what happened, natasha's like, "poor child." they stole some stick thingies from lowe's...my sister and wife are juvenile delinquents! sindy got some bright shiny stickers from borders. we put our hands in some fountain which was warm to me cuz i was freezing but it was cold to the others. then my dad came and i left. he's really good at making me feel guilty.

        big, juicy pieces of chocolate   YES. soul calibur II, finally! game one bought. it's badass...maxi and link r0x0rz j00r b0x0rz. now i need wwe wrestlemania xix and my life is complete. hey i said the same thing about wwf no mercy but oh well. this morning was quite nondescript, then my dad suggested to see swat...DAMN GOOD MOVIE. better than pirates, which was quite slow at times. no one shined like johnny depp but everyone supported the script very well. also playing figure.09 -- linkin park is a big plus in my book, and i'm a sucker for plots where the badguy is just as smart as the good guy. then, visited my grandma in the hospital, my brother was an ass and didn't even wave to her. drove over to sj to...thaitown 2? something...had pineapple fried rice, chicken curry and pad thai...pad thai = why have you forsaken my life until now? my brother tried to kick me cuz he was mad that we were actually eating someplace new, but he missed cuz he sucks. then got home, played basketball, got online with a headache, i told barbara but we didn't take it seriously, then i started getting chills...shivering and teeth chattering...it wasn't even cold outside. so i had to bundle up and sleep, my dad said it might've been cuz of the medication, liss said it might've been cuz of the operation itself. anyway, kinda scared me.  my cousin jill might come visit next month!! coool...wonder if angela can come too...get them to see pixar and stuff...an a's game? they are on a crazy tear, yo. anyway, movies later today...family reunion #2! hahah...get to see the in-laws again. cool.

        VMAs 2003   MADONNA KISSED BRITNEY SPEARS AND CHRISTINA AGUILERA. check out alex's xanga for pics. ok, owen moment over.  winners  urlLink here.  (for having an oscar-winning song, i thot eminem was really screwed.) quite an underwhelming show compared to last year imo. instead of scintillating performances from p. diddy, justin timberlake, bruce springsteen, eminem etc, we had rather subpar songs from coldplay, 50 cent (yes it sucked imo), i don't know who else cuz it was so forgettable. and whereas jimmy fallon had a great energy and enthusiasm (read: opening song montage and impersonations of lance bass etc), chris rock was mean-spirited and didn't show much originality. funny jokes though...  "my favorite show is making the band 2, cuz p. diddy is mentoring these kids. who better than puff daddy to show them wrong from wronger? ... paula abdul judging a singing contest is like Christopher reeves judging a dance contest ... 50 cent took more shots to the face than jenna jameson!... our next presenter is being sued by more people than the catholic church -- p. diddy!"  jimmy fallon with the fab 5: "ever heard of the show 'black eye from a straight guy'?"  ben stiller: "the viewer's choice award is...cruz bustamante!" *crickets*  jack black: "if someone told me a year ago i would be getting the super genius of the universe award, i wouldn't have believed it. david blaine, your magic is real and i believe in you!"  adam sandler: "i saw beyonce in the backstizzle, her tizzle put a gizzle in my pizzle!" snoop dogg: "i thought you was married." sandler: "ah shizzle!"  crank yankers doing viewers' choice: "first vote for kelly clarkson! haha, what, is this her mom? no i'm kidding...oh, um, hi mrs. clarkson. how are you?" ... "i like bitches and hoes!! yaaay!!"  eminem in easily the funniest skit of the night: "you remember last year when i beat the shit out of some puppet that was saying shit about me. so i went into anger management, and i'm a changed man. i learned violence against puppets and people is wrong." "it's my birthday, yaaay!!" *beats the shit out of the puppet* "i've learned to treat puppets with respect..."  ben stiller: "maybe we can cop an award at the oscars. we have to win something." drew Barrymore: "you might win for most Caucasian attempt to plug a movie." stiller: "damn bitch, that shit's old!"  good charlotte breaking their guitars and equipment ... man, rage against the machine called, they want their retarded stage destruction gimmick back. "good charlotte? more like a mediocre green day." hahaha...  then daily show... "California is in a terrible state. we need someone with a fresh view, someone new and inexperienced. what if you had a plumbing problem -- the problem is with the pipes. what you need is someone original and unique to fix it, someone who's never done plumbing before. we could try a new approach--say, without pipes."  jay leno: "i ordered a big mac and fries, and for 39 cents more they told me i could run for governor ... we have 194 candidates, 194 and a half if you count gary coleman ... mike Tyson filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, which incidentally is the highest chapter he's ever reached... demi moore and ashton kutcher are thinking of marriage, which is good cuz it's a lot easier to do than adoption. they want to book their honeymoon flight quickly, while they still have the 'kids fly free' program."  ben Affleck reading gigli reviews: "it was so terrible i had to clean my palate with glitter." ouchies.

        the draft...of LIMITED PERIL   linky time first...WTF happened to the aim home page? it became...*gasp*... urlLink cool ...  here's our  urlLink fantasy football draft , i had some decent picks...willis mcgahee boo yeah! james had some good sleeper picks.  on to yesterday. woke up early again (5 hours of sleep woot woot), took ac to the whs orientation. i had NO FUCKING CLUE where i was, kinda walked around the flagpole, the front doors were locked, finally found a big line of sophs with jade and esther. jade just got her rabies-infected mole removed so i kept on poking it. for 8:10 in the morning, it was pretty damn hot. then my niece sindy arrived, she wanted money but i had to be strong and teach her the power of...willpower and being cheap. alex, gayzel and natasha arrived at 8:30-ish...natasha: "gayzel, we had to wait for you for 30 minutes!" gayzel: "no...it was only, 15 or 20!" it's weird, natasha can say "though" and "the" but she's like "i don't want sindy to have a brudder!" haha sry natasha. o yea, washington's main building is cool, otherwise i agree the rest is utter crap. gayzel couldn't go inside maze cuz they were only accepting a-l, so rishi (their asb vp) let her sneak in. we all waited and sat down, alex saw glenn pham! so i talked to him, he's cool but his voice is really weird. then gayzel and sindy came out and got lockers and their cp books of finite mediocrity.   we saw my at washington mutual, she looked really cool in her uniform, and she had a PLAQUE. awesomeness. then went to jamba, the guy gave drinks to gazel, taasha and cindy (probably, iono). then natasha put her drink on a table but gayzel tried to move it and it all SPILLED. looked really thick and nasty. gayzel, being HELLA ASIAN (tm...i need to stop this), offered to buy natasha new drink, but natasha, not wanting to be outdone, also was HELLA ASIAN (tm) and said she wouldn't drink it. she did anyway. then we walked around the boring hub and checked out bed bath and beyond, where we abused the girls with our massagers of doom, listened to the "perfect husband"? toy say "of course you don't look fat in that dress. you don't look fat in anything", watch in shock and awe as alex let a halloween hand's fingers touch his tongue, and stick tape under sindy's flip-flops (they all had the exact same flip-flops) and stare at her feet. then sindy accused both alex and natasha of being hoes...guess it runs in the family. went into target and looked at cars, then we went to get picked by ankur, alex finally hugged gayzel for the first time. that's my little boy! or not. ankur's gas light was already on, but he brazenly drove with completely disregard for the laws of physics ("thou shalt not drive thy automobile without sufficient gasoline"). his hair is really thick now, i think he should cut it but whatever. i got dropped off at school and chased down my dad in his van to get in for my second WISDOM TOOTH OPERATION, which hurt pretty bad this time. no gas, fuck those cheap azn bitches. my dad bought THE TWO TOWERS...the fullscreen version! *TeaR* damn fullscreen versions to hell. go legolas! and return of the king looks DEAD SEXAY. fun fun.

        culmination of orientation experimentation   fun day. started it off by being HELLA ASIAN (tm) and going to school at 9:40, i finished the whole walkthrough in like 5 minutes. talked to a bunch of people, liss is dropping ap chem waah...there's actually a decent amount of people taking ap chem. my schedule's alright (i forgot most of it haha) but FRICKIN ALEX got rojo. damn him! damn him and his guaranteed 100+% if he tries. i wonder how in the hell i'm going to get pat his gift, it's...bulky...alex left, stopped by to visit kat and see her legendary signature of astonishment and awesomeosity. ran into tiffany s guarding the back door of the cafeteria, she claimed to be "objective" like owen when keeping people out but she let krizelda in...psh...just cuz she's asb prez means nothing :D all the sophs with mrs t...damn j00! damn j00 all to hell! then i hung out with my, sally and loan, my's old enough to see r-rated movies by herself which is really cool. she didn't finish signing my leg! yup. alex came back, we shot around while the girls' tennis team did tryouts with brahmst banging a stick on the ground..."3, 4..." "5, 6!" then we played 1 on 1, i got tired and he beat me 8-6, tho i made a funky layup over the back of the backboard. then cheryn tried to assail us for underground info on her teachers, then we washed up and met my brother in the LONG ASS line for pics. poor sophs. he didn't even ask his friends to cut, even though they were like 20 people behind him...alex: "screw your friends!"   said hi to heather, who tried to subvert the general serenity of the surroundings by cutting in plain view of da 5-0. but i made her see the light. natasha and jun came, then gayzel and sindy did too. me and alex went over to them, i talked to jocelynn, tyler, tammy and nicole, everyone thot their tennis tryouts were crap. like how girls always think they look ugly or fat when they're not. i reiterate, i'm glad to be a guy. joce had to take a shower cuz she had...carrot breath...the carrot munchies strike again. then we went inside and the freshies got their lockers (bottom lockers, puahahha) then they went out to the grass outside 300 wing. alex was talking about how nish didn't seem to like him, everytime nish saw a bunch of kids he'd smile, then he'd see alex and his smile would disappear. we told the freshies scary stories about lott and how he hates hosers. glad to be away from him. then me, alex, natasha, sindy and gayzel all decided to walk to hypernet and drop off jun (who went to see hot guys at bally's). hypernet, all the comps were filled, so we all just sat and talked and got off on kevin a's hair and watched him get awped like nobody's biznass. then me and alex played, i was murdered, except for this one time where i got 3 kills in a round, including the final kill on adam. woot.   we quit, natasha, sindy and gayzel were staring at some magazine, then adam joined us and we decided to walk to my house. people from spain are technically white, right? and what's up with the caucasian deal anyway? it's just an excuse to be asian. they didn't even come from caucasia...everyone knows michael jackson did...then we played life, fun fun, gayzel got no money from her 3 stock until she switched it with 9 then we spun hecka 3's, we rolled so many 4's (natasha's stock) that we had to trade in 10's for 100's. gayzel won with $2.375 M (only cuz she got the luxurious split-level haha), adam with $2.285 M (we had to add a bunch of money he hid), me with $2.035 M (i didn't cheat! i even forgot when people spun my stock), nastasha with $1.89 M, sindy with $1.415 M (and that beach-house where she could stare at hot guys from), and alex with $775,000 (he got crappy life tiles). then me and adam were brutalized by alex in timesplitters 2, then adam left, we stared at alex's pics (gayzel = o.O) and created a family. alex and gayzel are married, daughter: sindy. natasha is alex's little sister, and i'm married to her. small little family but it'll grow, i imagine. sindy can't have a brother cuz gayzel doesn't wanna go thru the "work" and alex wants her to be a loner. gayzel and sindy kept on slapping each other...child abuse...! then they got picked up, and alex left, and that's about it.

ONE out of eight. this is california, isn't it? hot as hell, waited for about five years outside, got to hang out with hella people, adam kept on trying to beg people to play cards and eventually we played mafia which was fun although i still don't get it. adam offered parisa some sprite in a sobe bottle and parisa was like, is that pee? then she and sumit started talking about the color of their pee. you know you're in a good relationship when you can openly talk about bodily functions. yeup. me and adam whaled away at elyse with air-kicks while she complained about freshmen that don't cooperate. don't they all.   joanna tried to get out of carrying desks just cuz she's a precious little soph, but we know their kind better than that. liss gave me a snickers ice cream bar (YOU RULE!) and let me try her lip thingy that looks like a highlighter...hahahah it smelled good...just glad nobody noticed. amanda took BAD care of my precious cards...they got on top of a soda machine...it's ok though, she whupped us good in hearts even though she and selena kept LEAVING. some hearts partners they are. i got locker 170, not too bad, mei got this one locker that had a bazillion pieces of gum wedged on the door. nasty. it took like 10 minutes with my key to get rid of it...mei was the 100th person to say i look like a girl in the vortex pic. why me??? then me, eugene and alex went out to leave, we talked about how briefs are more comfortable than speedoes and varsity bath towels and yea. apparently gayzel passed by and saw us...coool, then we went home. then i slept.   PENNY HARDAWAY IN THAT ONE BASKETBALL MOVIE WITH NICK NOLTE!!! AHHH!!!!

        happy birthday alex   nothing today, got bored shitless getting sprinkler stuff from home depot and my brother got a new bike which he's really pissy and protective about. it's alright, it's got front shocks so you can climb onto curbs like nobody's business. but you can't feel bumps so the fun's all gone. boring street bike. my bike was fixed too, neat.  yesterday was fun. went over to school for spanish club carwash, there was really nobody i knew so i felt like a loser (besides the fact that i walked to the carwash). world-famous brainiac annan was there, he's cool, he was like bragging about gettin an src from sykes. mrs. schwalbe came (the one who kicked me out of that spanish club meeting haha), eugene e wanted to go to james' bday party but he was about five hours early. TAM ASKED FOR IT! SHE SOOO ASKED FOR IT. WHATEVER SHE SAYS, SHE HAD IT COMING. KARMA! mei-shan's cool, she didn't go through the whole teen angst thingy so she's allowed to like pink cars. rita had that gangsta walk like she's above petty gatherings like carwashes but i ain't trippin. selena tried to retaliate for a meek sud attack from yours truly but heather valiantly protected me from inexorable doom and death (actually, i just kinda hid behind her). course, heather hulked up and took care of business, but that's another story. jen wong drove in her spiffy avalon, we tried to trap her inside with hoses; she eventually escaped, but not without enduring terrible battle scars that will last forever. she had the audacity to threaten not to pay just cuz of that inconsequential water attack! and just cuz she's '05 prez, and a varsity basketball star, and a varsity track star....psht that's nothing...  then i went to alex's house for his birthday party. he, simran and sloan were there staring at like a mountain of model cars perched precariously on the pyramidical precipice of peril. whatever. we sim'd me and sloan v. alex and simran on nba 2k3, and sloan kept on going yes! whenever i scored. "sloan, that was ryan..." it was actually sorta close, simran kept on missing EVERYTHING. just like in real life :D we went out to play, natasha, gayzel and sindy arrived, alex's cousin michael came out and i tried to make him play, failing miserably in the attempt. kevin came, we all went in and watched the ring, simran kept on fondling kevin ("why aren't you acting gay?" "not TODAY, simran"). alex's sister rachel interrupted the spookiness in the middle (the shutter's were swinging =O or maybe it was just the wind) and took pics, alex gladly sat on simran's lap and then simran like...fake-kissed him? something. kevin had to leave early, cool movie, first time i saw it (yes i'm a loser). went into alex's room and saw triumph at hollywood squares (tom bergeron: "is it healthy to shave your dog?" or something, "i don't know, personally i would rather shave my pussy...cat! i said cat!!"). we kept on waiting for erik to come, when we thought it was him we all stared at the door cuz he always turns hecka red. we ate pizza, gayzel, natasha and sindy had like 5 slices each.  erik finally came, we played basketball again, then rachel came out to take pics again, alex got behind simran who got behind erik but they moved, then erik squatted, "what are you doing? taking a crap?" "no, i'm squatting!" "yea, squatting to take a crap!" the girls listened to my ipod attentively as alex's cousin krystal ran out and yanked gayzel's hair straight off the scalp. then michael started chasing krystal in circles. kinda cute. we went inside to eat cake, then watched NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. DAMN I HATE THAT MOVIE. JOHNNY DEPP...EWWW. erik kept on poking me. grrr. pokes are evil. *poke* 1 damage! natasha left cuz she saw the movie, but she came back to scare the living nightlights out of sindy and gayzel. she was talking to keagan...bwhahaha...we went to alex's room and caught natasha chatting, we tried to see her convo but she kept on pressing escape. then we played hide and seek, it was ok but really nowhere to hide, i spooked sindy twice in a row, i HELLA got natasha and she smacked me. everytime i tried to scare gayzel, she was like, ow. alex crawled on the floor once, which freaked everyone out. we played around with alex's dartgun and his very pliable glasses which i think are too big for him. i wallopped sloan with a pillow, sloan got me back with a DART FROM HELL though. then we played life and i was stuck with one of alex's old toy cars cuz we were missing the white car. i annoyed everybody with the rules and strategy. alex and gayzel both went on spring break while sindy bought books and went to study in europe. we had a gigantic six-some on top of my car but then the girls had to leave, so me and sloan watched triumph at the star wars premiere (middle-aged darth vader: "this button controls the sound of my breathing." triumph: "does this button tell your parents to go pick you up?"). FUNNY. some girl was there..."how does it feel to be surrounded by guys who have no idea how to please you?" then erik left, alex got hella bored and talked to gayzel online, and i left.

        link, la partie deux   see, i know my french. haha angela, thanx for the comment on my xanga (which i don't actually use but hey), that made my day. i thought i had joined cuz you did but i don't remember anymore. old age getting to me...  today (er, yesterday) was better than yesterday (the day before), mainly being it was alex's 16th birthday so it had to be good. woke up late, played diablo ii for...a long time, then alex came over to play basketball but he walked outside and was like...wtf?! cuz it started raining though it was sunny. so he came in and we played street, he beat me twice, he times his blocks really well. then we went to link, saw ankur first ("did you buy a burger?" "no, i just bought this bag, stupid"). high-fived melissa s (who yelled richard!! like a groupie lol); kat was scarfing away at a candy bar that tiffany selfishly stole with no visible remorse. we went inside, i nabbed my shirt before the line stretched to tahiti. ankur got a star on his receipt cuz he asked if the signer was a demote, but i think it's cuz she's got the hots for him. oooh yeaah.   eugene had this really long-armed monkey, he said it looked like erik...no...more like erik looks like the monkey :D doesn't abdullah terminator nezami just flow off the tongue? erik gave alex his birthday present (ps2 network adapter), kat didn't like it cuz it was oddly shaped and hard to wrap. it would be neat if we had crescent-shaped network adapters, but that's the breaks. simran spent hella money on alex. and got him a card. AND bought $200 worth of retro iverson clothes. crazy boy. broke too. devika came to wish happy birthday to her only son, even though i had to remind her. mothers these days, so forgetful. i also waved to elyse sometime but she ignored me, so i came over and gave her piece of my passive, unintimidating mind, then air-kicked (is that how you say it?) her. that's for you adam. word life. fuh. we got in a circle again (hurting our collective asses to no end) and sang old mcdonald, neil said "tree" and did some weird swaying thingy.   we got in groups and jenn WALLOPED erik with the strongest smack i've seen in many a day. boxing quality. now erik gets a hurting left arm to match alex's, haha. ran to dinner again (beat alex woot), bought anitra some food, there was about 1/3 the people compared to yesterday (er, the day before). jenn wanted to buy amita curly fries ("i know you don't eat meat, so i'll get you some chicken nuggets") but i warned amita about the dangers of fake-fingernail-infested taters of doom. needless to say she wasn't too hungry after that. my job...is complete. alex was about to ditch me so i followed and he biked away so i walked in solace and almost got run over by ira in her land rover while jaywalking (doesn't everybody?). got into our real groups, i was with whitney and devika, who are in it for the kids. all for the kids. field trips, pre-locked lockers, random condemnations, all for the kids. whitney wants to spike her hair so they will think she's cool. o the sacrifices we noble juniors must make for our country's future...  devika was woozy, but that's ok cuz her gum was spiked with e. she was shocked, shocked to hear about alex's summer liaisons. which is no big deal cuz alex was the result of her liaison. the grandparents don't know, shh. we grouped up again for stupid games. counting went nowhere cuz jenn spent hours "facilitating" our discussion when everyone else finished, so finally elyse and jen randomly yelled out 20. the name thing, we hadn't even started when they told us to sit down. we rule. we got up, belinda lost her katherine, melissa t got erik's brother ahahhaha, she thinks the short chubby blond kids are cute. someone had neha's cousin, ankur's cousin, ankur's sister?, melissa's brother, so many siblings. FOR ME TO POOP ON!! er, yeah. whitney bravely withdrew from battle early, leaving me and devika to hold the fort. samyak didn't get the e joke, or did he? surreptitious little boy. we got our names at 9:35-ish, but devika quickly snatched them with her cruel grasp of deviousnessosity.   then, homeward bound. it was pitch black, but i didn't get raped, which is good. i think. i caught queer eye for the straight guy, which is an AWESOME show. haha. i can't believe they actually allowed some of the stuff on the show to get onto network tv. like the stereotypical straight farmer-tanned bald white trashy guy talking about his stereotypical fear of stereotypical fabulous gay guys. and the chocolate finger thing. you know what i mean. i swear, that carson guy is soo like keshav. funny stuff..."he said divine? he's gayer than we are!" then a bit of conan, it was old with chris rock promoting "head of state" (which sucked bad by the way). "i make fun of everybody, but i don't talk about oprah. my mom ain't shit but don't mess with oprah! she's the richest black person on the planet. after oprah the best we have is deion sanders."  maan, cousins are cool.

        uber idea of the day    urlLink Pistons send Robinson, Sanchez to Warriors for Sura . wow...all of a sudden the warriors have learned how to trade. wonder if this reshuffling will help our record though...robinson isn't so bad.  now, i read in the newspaper today...school blogs! like  urlLink this one . or a  urlLink more sophisticated one . that's such a cool idea, it would foster an unprecedented level of collaboration and discussion and all that generic blah stuff. study groups without the groups. i'd hella go for it for english for example.

        link   ehh. it was fun i guess. gotta say hi to a decent number of people, got ignored by a decent number of people. within minutes the place was flooded and hotter than george bush talking to reporters ("we've got a darn good plan for iraq, and i'm fixing to kill some terroristors!"). sorry, that was stupid. belinda got a ride which was good, otherwise the tables would start vaporizing. during the 4 lines, it's weird how when you're supposed to find a "random" person to talk to you always run into a friend. simran: "i'm a flaming homosexual. *points to alex* so is he." o yea, i'll say it again, alex carabello is the biggest fruitcake west of richard simmons. hey, let's go yell out random things during a discussion and watch as nobody laughs!  dinner, me and alex were the first to leave (which got us confused cuz nobody else left), he biked to jack but i beat him running. erik bought another pair of the EXACT SAME verticals! WTF! richard and eugene got taller than me, abdullah is like 6 feet now, melissa t bought a kid's meal...! who buys kids' meals these days? well, maybe if they're giving teenie beanie babies, but still. amita recapitulated (sat word :D) about her famous day at stanford beach? or something, where she broke the guinness book of world records for guys picked up in an hour. then parisa and rricha (two r's!) talked about lairy fights (teehee) and how the ending of book 5 DID SUCK. then i tried to eat and failed miserably cuz of my mouth, but parisa's gonna have to take out all 4 wisdom teeth together (puahahahha).  back at school, stupid cheers (what happened to richard? "1600? of course i get 1600 all the time selling my drugs man, it's the hip thing to do"), then the fake link groups which was good cuz my ass got really numb sitting for so long. then i was inexplicably chosen for the 2nd example, which was stupid cuz i talked during the first game and someone called me "chang" in the second game. then liss complained about her senior pics (which i'm going to see, someday...) and me and alex walked home in sorta pitch blackness. all in all pretty good, but only to see people cuz we learned literally nothing.

FUCK squared. salt water, gauze, a bazillion pills all over again, gas-free pain beyond pain...why must life be so cruel to me ;-;

        checklist   for...certain people...for YOU DAMMIT! YOU!!  +  urlLink google toolbar  (mainly allows you to search from any window, and it blocks pop-ups!)  + SAT, PSAT, AP, and SAT II prep books...Princeton Review is good because it gives you an online SAT and...other  urlLink pointless things ...  +  Farewell to Arms  by Ernest Hemingway and  Ceremony  by Leslie Marmon Silko (if you're like me and waited till now to read)  +  urlLink Action Plan: Juniors   + stupid obvious things like the registration folder, binder, paper (BLUE PAPER...), pens, scissors, cellphones, mufflers

        WTFWTFWTF   someone posting as "kevin bella" just commented on my blog. WTF! if it's a fake, it's a pretty good one, cuz he seemed to be really offended at what i said. but how could he find my blog? it's...obscure as hell...if it's really him, then hey i know some things about your campaign...i heard about the threat  from a councilwoman? about you costing the city so much money to run, but then somebody else joined so that point is moot. you have an honorable standpoint from which to run, but i think it isn't worth the effort and money to run just for principle -- and besides, you've got uc davis to worry about. just my opinion, but if you want to open the public's eyes to that sort of thing, you could try a newsletter, a letter to the editor, a flyer campaign...use the recall instead of a comparatively obscure and expensive school council election campaign to further your cause. of course, all this is pointless if you aren't really kevin bella, but it does seem you are. and thank you for commenting, that's really cool of you to do so.  edit 12:08 AM: I just realized that since Google bought Blogger, maybe blogs will go on search results. Ergo, this (un)lovely site can be found on page 4 for "kevin bella" and page 11 for "most extreme elimination challenge." that's cool...it only took like 10 hours to find me...

        the inimitable joys of aim   last night made up for a rather ho-hum day. got in a chatroom with alex, natasha, gayzel and sindy and we talked about...sex ed and strawberry and kiwi condoms. condoms? er...candy...yup. and we compared soda and sandwich shops and weird things like that. sindy and natasha left later, so i typed lyrics randomly and then posted alex's old raps and stuff...really funny...  ALe X c53: Ankur needs to get a front door, the cable company cant even hook him up no more? This shit im doing righ there is gay, say...would you wanna eat some hay!!!! BY THE BAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TODAY!!!!????  then they left cuz it was late and alex had to leave around 8 am to go to la today. then i talked to jill, who's off to vegas for 5 days but cuz she's only 19 and broke she's got absolutely nothing to do. we talked about late night shows..."what did you expect me to do at night? sleep early?" and TMI and stuff. apparently we're supposed to get MAJORLY obsessed with the opposite sex in the coming years. we'll just have to find out shan't we? talking about it beats doing it, right...er...whatever. yea, she's probably the person i most like talking to (when she actually responds relatively promptly lol)...like, cuz she's a cousin so there's less awkwardness, she's in college and likes politics and news too -- common interests that transcend age and gender...er...yea -- so i can say the tongue-in-cheek things other people wouldn't understand (which kinda keeps my mind sharp). i can really say what i feel like saying to her, and she doesn't condescend or go "ummm...right..." and i guess she can seem like a big sister at times. i've always wanted someone like that...someone just a few years older who's been through everything and i can get actual firsthand advice from. i can bowl better than her too, which doesn't hurt. :D  cousins are cool.

        on to yesterday   note: the backgrounds are final fantasy x-2, which i can't play cuz i have gamecube. it's nothing to do with the girls, though alex will think otherwise. ha. also, i FINALLY downloaded a full version of miss independent. after a week of finding 15+ versions that would always end up in static. i rule! not.  mechy note: did anyone see the vma ad with michelle branch? i guess it was, "what big secret are we going to have in this year's vma's?" mechy: "i don't care, as long as it isn't michael jackson and lisa marie presley kissing again." ooo, incendiary comments there. nice. hey, it beats jimmy fallon's *expletive deleted* in an ice cube.  yesterday was fun, again. i woke up early to eat half a bowl of fruity pebbles with the left side of my mouth, then jetted over to school to find amanda and play some basketball. we saw dorian practicing soccer by himself, that boy is insane. alex came soon, so we shot around for five minutes and then me and amanda went to play some tennis, and alex (who hates tennis with an unmitigated passion) stayed by his lonesome to shoot around. it was fun, amanda's backhands were really nice, but her forehands could use some work. but then look who's talking. i kinda got dizzy and everything turned all bright and fuzzy, but then the sky turned blue again and i was ok. we went back to alex and he beat me 3-1. then we went to the liquor store, amanda on her badass scooter, and bought drinks. then we went to the back of school and saw james, glenn (who's moving back to american...cool), jenny (blood? eww!), my brother, saagar, and gerber.   amanda wanted to go home but not by herself (even though all she does at home is like...shower...and...i don't know), so alex tried to fold her scooter but i did it in a flash. go me. the girls called and amanda wanted to see who alex's squeeze was. we met them in front of the tennis courts, and amanda recognized gay-ZELL cuz she looks like scoth apparently? then the girls and alex played some tennis ("i hate tennis!"), so me and amanda played basketball. the girls didn't want to play, so they went to the gym. alex can't do a layup to save his life. the girls were on the monkeybars, which reminded me of last year when i couldn't reach that top bar then i finally did was really happy and alex saw me then i let go and fell on my ass. then amanda had to go home so me and alex followed the girls, he wanted to race me on his bake so i sprinted really fast and alex was slow then i passed the alcove into the gym and gayzel or natasha was like boo! and i felt really stupid. then we walked to the swings in los cerritos (on the way, gayzel was like, "i didn't know geese could fly"). everybody but sindy got on a swing and i finally learned how to swing high. we went to jack and no one bought anything, then we decided to go to my house to get some "big, hard" peaches. my dad was home though, but we came in anyway.   we gingerly stepped across the threshold cuz my dad was home and we watched some 8 mile. sindy kept on trying to squeeze next to natasha and whenever i gave her a pillow she hit natasha with it. kat dropped off erik (erik should be commended for having the gall to sit in an automobile driven by the notoriously fiendish motorist known as katherine leung) then we gawked at his phone. me and natasha switched places, but sindy curled up even smaller. it felt like that one night at ankur's house. they left, i got pissed cuz my brother stole my medicine and ipod ("it's cuz he borrowed my racket and, um, he stared at us during practice!" fag), but we ate. then my dad and uncle left to the hospital so i watered the front lawn (and got scared cuz the sprinkler almost got me wet), then i dried my basketball cuz it was in the line of fire...er...water. then i played for a bit, hella people passed by, then i turned on instinct to the side around 8-ish cuz cars drive in all the time and i don't like getting run over you kno, and i looked right at alex. me and alex played basketball and he murdered me 11-0. 11-0! bageled! donuted! that's not even a word, that's how bad it was. there was some kid staring at us from a 2nd story window. stalker!   powerpuff girls...we said sindy talks like bubbles and she had blue on, and natasha is blossom cuz she's tallest so she's kinda like the leader. so gayzel was stuck with buttercup and she threatened to hit me. she also had some green on, which she doesn't like cuz it's a horny color. but buttercup is cool cuz she beats all the people up. i was the professor cuz i had glasses, and alex was the MONKEY! gayzel found chalk and everyone started writing stuff, sindy thought she found chalk, but it turned out to be rock. then she found another piece, but it was actually styrofoam. then we went to alex's house, the girls were chatting, actually it was just sindy ghostwriting for everybody cuz she types fast. natasha likes gta cuz you can run over senior citizens. gayzel: "do you have any killing games?" alex took pics of all the girls and drew weird things like, sindy with a stick figure on her head. we looked at alex's first msj elementary yearbook (it was paperback...it's msj for god's sakes! msj!). gayzel's uncle and natasha's mom kept calling, alex's mom called once ("where am i? at home obviously, you called our home number"). then they left at 10, and i ran home. i took medicine and rinsed my mouth with salt water (now i remember why i hate the beach), then i watched daily show and fell asleep without knowing it. my dad woke me up and looked pissed. i slept...walking around at night looking at the stars is nice. don't take that for granted, in la the smog is so bad you can't ever see any.

        i love news   first...my condolences to the over  urlLink 3,000 dead in france alone  because of their record heat wave. temperatures have been averaging 100 degrees for days now. to counter the heat,  urlLink parisians are sleeping on tiles , in wet T-shrits, and walking naked right in front of their open windows. also, there has been a  urlLink massive blackout  in the northeast us and canada, affecting toronto, ohio, and new york state. "New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it was likely the blackout started in the Niagara Falls area and quickly spread." it's always the canadians, isn't it!  now...135 official candidates. FUCK. yes, we are the stupidest state in america. jay leno (who invited all candidates to a sept. 22 taping of his show): "even florida is laughing at us." (a darrell issa shirt: "i spent $1.75 million on this campaign, and all i got was this lousy t-shirt." he's not running.) personally i would have supported richard riordan, but hey arnold would be an interesting change. stupid davis is trying to highlight a vote arnold made in  1994  against rights for illegal immigrants. and all the special interest groups that funded davis's record campaign, and who subsequently were ignored by davis after the election? he's now talking to them again, trying to wheel and deal for their preferred legislation and essentially bribe their constituents' votes. talk about desperation.  ralph nader  urlLink got a pie in the face . woohoo.  davis is supporting a new proposal to rescind the tripling of the state's car tax. breathe easier, those of ye in current possession of those four-wheeled godsends of bliss.    urlLink partial candidate platform list :   Joel Britton:  "I am for a workers' and farmers' government, which will abolish capitalism in the US and join in the worldwide struggle for socialism." (hello basho!)  D. Clements:  "I'm a long shot candidate, but like the horse Seabiscuit, sometimes the long shot can win." (you and the other 125+ long shots)  Warren Farrell:  "Equal father and mother involvement (yea, a governor really can do that)...more male teachers; boy-friendly schools." (yea, cuz going to school is an exercise in torture for boys exclusively.)  Larry Flynt:  "california...would welcome having a smut peddler who cares as their governor." (of course.)  Lorraine (Abner Zurd) Fontanes:  hahaha...abner zurd...  Trek Thunder Kelly:  "I will legalize drugs, gambling and prostitution so they can be taxed and regulated... I don't care who you marry or have sex with." (amen to that. er...)  Jerry Kunzman:  "California has some obvious problems. I have some solutions. I don't have all the answers, but that's what advisers are for." (honesty in politics! finally. jill, you have an opening...)  Bruce Margolin:  "We should teach basic criminal penalties (huh?) and yoga in our schools." (go away.)  Paul Mariano:  "I am the only candidate who will appoint Davis as chief of staff in charge of the day-to-day governance of California." (and you wonder why you're the only one...)  Ronald Jason Palmieri:  "[Do] not waste your vote on those...who will never be elected." (hello, what are you doing on the ballot then? loser.)  Bill Prady:  Promises to end the state's problems "in 22 minutes and 44 seconds." (why not 23 minutes? just to make it even.)  Kevin Richter:  "I breathe." (that's good...the only breathing candidate on the ballot.)   urlLink mike cassidy : A "debate between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gary Coleman? (Jeez, Arnold, don't step on him.) ... (The bad news [about the recall]: When it's over (edit: love that song), we'll still have a governor... [Liberal candidate Ariana] Huffington is an inspiration. She's tired of the corruption of expensive campaigns. She's pledge to hold her spending at [only] $10 million... If Arnold is elected, is he...going to need bodyguards?"  old joke: "on its opening weekend, gigli made less money than nemo, which I think has been out since '88."   urlLink NBC4 TV : "The 911 call Kobe Bryant made the day before he surrendered to police on a sexual assault accusation was 'for medical assistance for his wife,' authorities said." so the tabloids were right for once! wow, the moon is really blue tonight...  six people are setting up camp in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library (the new one in San Jose) to break a Guinness world record by reading over three days straight, nonstop. "The Guinness rules are strict," says the  urlLink San Jose Mercury News : "No more than six people are permitted to read...each for a maximum of three hours at a time. THe pause between readers cannot be longer than 30 seconds. Each member of the team must read, eat, and sleep in the library." my question is, who the fuck cares?  an 18-year-old teenager Kevin Bella is running for Los Altos school board member even though he's attending u.c. davis this fall. yes! that's a perfect way to reform stodgy, antiquated, bureaucratic messes in school boards -- by having a board member who can only be in the city 2 days a month!

        clarification   nothing special today, just visited the hospital with my uncle, talked about sports...looking back at the last post, i should mention that i'm not saying i don't enjoy my friends...you guys have been some really special people through it all, and i thank you all for that. i'm really grateful that i've been able to get to call you all as friends, even the freshmen. but last night, i was just looking at who i am and trying to figure out all the why's...and now i understand myself just a little more. and that, i think, is a lot more important than some stupid grades and test results will ever be.

        revelation   "i've got a joke for you. a priest, a rapist, and a pedophile walk into a bar...and that's just the first guy." "you've made more bombs than hamas." "your show was so bad, even tivo would reject the repeats." "dr. dre is here tonight. make sure to thank him when he brings your car out for you." "of course he doesn't do drugs. what is he, 6'3", 110 pounds? of course he doesn't." "he's so skinny he could use a kotex wrapper as a sleeping bag."  blah, i've kinda lost the mood i was in when i wanted to write this (damn you dennis leary roast), but i still know what i want to write. i've been sitting here all day ignoring most people online and feeling crappy about myself without knowing why. maybe just one of those valleys i've dipped into after climbing a peak. yea whatever. it's a little deeper...after playing basketball tonight (because i forced myself to go outside), i walked and thought, that wasn't too fun, i want to play with somebody. then i realized...who would i really truly enjoy playing with? sure, i thought of quite a few people, but the point remains...can you get bored of your friends? can you get bored of the same old? can you get bored of being the same restrained, introverted person you always were? yes. i can. look at me the past couple of years. same exact thing. just kinda going out of my way to not doing anything with girls...i just get nervous or aloof or shy or act completely neutral. so i feel stupid, and girls just kinda wash over me.   that's why i started school the way i did last year...erik, jenn, pat, they know what i'm talking about. i was different...i don't even remember. i guess i was louder and more social and stuff. "it's both good and bad," pat said. but i guess i enjoyed it...it was fun. something new for me. i wasn't restricting myself as much? but then of course i said something that in retrospect i would have never done. i never realy understood why i did it, but now looking at it, i believe it was just because i wanted to know how everybody would react, if things would get better. of course they didn't...kinda went downhill. and i got bitter and reverted to my old self. i don't know how, but a secret just isn't a secret today so long as people desperately search for conversation-starters. i�m just expected to be inconspicuous and unmemorable (if that's a word). that's all it is...expectations and reality. and if i act differently..."stop pretending to be somebody else!" and that's where i am again, today.  yes, jen wrote about this way back in the beginning of the school year, but haven't you ever wished to be somewhere that nobody knew you and you had the freedom to be who you really wanted to be?

       happy sweet 16 jenn! lol i'll make sure my hookups in la get your pic...you sure you don't want to meet those hunky eskimos? need...sparkles...  lol sorry kat, i don't im you because you're usually talking to erik and i don't want to bother you...but anyway...  From  urlLink Dave Barry's website :  What message would you like to send to the teenagers of America?  Your hats are backward.  Also, he points out in an article today in the  urlLink Mercury News  that with a recall election including the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger ("Ach'll be bahck"), Bill Simon ("I  am  a credible candidate, dammit!"), Cruz Bustamante (vote against the recall but for me!), Gary Coleman (funnily short former security guard), Larry Flynt (paraplegic porn playboy), and Mary Carey (a porn star who has really "promised tax deductions for lap dances and an anti-violence program that would let people trade guns for X-rated videos"), we "greedy Californians" are about to cause Florida to "lose the coveted title of 'The Doofus State.'...  "To make matters worse, Gray [Davis] lost the state budget surplus...it's gone. They've looked everywhere, but they can't find it. It's the Weapon of Mass Destruction of budget surpluses... So now Gray is spectacularly unpopular... When he tries to get into the governor's house, his own dog attacks him... Of course California is not the first state to [be] led by a known bonehead. Many other states have gone through this...the way they have traditionally handled it is to pretend that the bonehead is competent and popular, thus causing him to be so impressed with himself that he resigns from the governorship and runs for president of the United States.  "But California has a unique system of government, known technically as the 'Any Random Loon Can Put Any Random Thing on the Ballot if Enough Random Loons Agree' system. If you're a Californian, and you want to put something to a statewide vote, all you have to do is gather a couple of million signatures. That sounds like a lot, but in California you can get that many signatures in 45 minutes merely by approaching disgruntled motorists gridlocked on a freeway during rush hour (6:30 am to 11:30 pm)... As a result, Californians are constantly voting on things. They have repealed gravity several times."

       great, i was having a good night and then alex comes and shits all over my blog. i actually thought some people wrote something cool or at least interesting. fuck you if i can't remember everything exactly bitch.  but anyway, today was kinda up and down. my dad woke me up early to see my grandma in the hospital, we went to albertsons to buy some food and i saw jenn at the water store! so i stopped in albertsons to buy a bag and stuff for her present, a painting of dolphins and fish with a rainbow above it that i found on the way to vegas. she saw me while i was going to longs for a card, she seemed really excited so i got nervous and wanted to make it really nice. then i came in and we talked a bit, then i gave her the present and she seemed happy. but she opened it and seemed like...disappointed...cuz it wasn't a dvd or something. she even looked at the price tag, which got me really embarrassed..."$7.99?" i kinda paid $20 for everything, judge from the price tag. so i felt really stupid and waited a bit while customers came in and tried to point out i gave her a card too, but she didn't seem to care anymore so i left.  then i went to washington hospital and saw my grandma, who's in pain i guess cuz she had surgery but she's still smiling and eating and stuff. i didn't want to help my cousin move so i delayed, and i kinda wanted to just walk by myself, but my dad took me to fremont bart and i sat there and slept and thought about if i should've bought something better for jenn and how basically every girl i know has already drifted from me. at any given time they're either with pat or erik or eugene or somebody, who are a whole lot more fun to talk to than i am. so what's the point of it all? but whatever. so i got to berkeley and my cousin picked me up and we moved her boyfriend zed's stuff (if a guy's name is zed, he has a ponytail, and literally 30 boxes of comic books, you know there's trouble). it took up the whole damn truck, i was sweating and my cousin and her bf almost didn't care. and she laughs like a goddamn hyena, but whatever. then we drove like a mile to their new house, and got some of his comedian/geek friends to help unpack. they joked about how since they're movers, they should be called bob and larry. they're all like in a writing circle or something, so when we finished and my cousin's sister came they all talked about periodic tables and gary coleman and how all of the stuff they learned in high school and college is basically worthless. they had soy pizza. ick. then my cousin took me back to bart and gave me $40, which made me forgive her completely. o, the power of green-on-white paper.  on the way back i slept some more, then ran back to the hospital and my grandma (who had some really nasty mushy food) and saw some of the chiefs/niners game. the niners were winning, but they still kinda sucked ass. they showed slamball tryouts, which was kinda cool even though prolly nobody on the planet watches it. we went home, ate dinner, i did a bunch of vacuuming, then i looked at basically every picture in our house. wedding pics, overseas, east coast, baby pics, you name it. this will sound stupid, but my parents could've been models when they were young. they looked really nice together. but for basically all i can remember, there's been some sort of barrier between them. hard to explain. the pics were really nice and i can't explain but i was just happy. my dad was even in the taiwanese army...then i get online and see what alex did. o well. sometimes that's all i expect from him. and erik too. don't think i'm that stupid. gee, what are friends for.  i'll probably get online now. good night.

        sushi!   last couple days were pretty fun. i always say that don't i. well, they were. yesterday me, my brother and my cousin farand went to emeryville to see the pixar studios. it's nice, they have a workout gym, soccer field, etc...and the place is really damn big. steve jobs visits every friday, so i was pissed we went there on a thursday. lots of posters of a bug's life, toy story, etc. in french and russian and madagascaran and stuff. they have the bathrooms right in the center room, the atrium, cuz you kno how bathrooms are the social centers of any building. it's cool cuz everyone has an office and a really awesome computer and there's no dress code and free soda. that's my idea of a perfect job. we watched seabiscuit there, yea it's slow though. and you can tell tobey maguire has a stunt double for races. but the acting is good. when the lights at the top went out, it became starry like in hogwarts. and the seats were short and everyone's asses and legs fell asleep.   we were hella hungry cuz it was 9 pm, so we passed by a model of bruce the shark and i was like, sushi! then we drove to berkeley cuz the fremont pho ("want some fuck?" haha) place was closed, we ate at some sandwich shop. i paid with my dad's $50, bling bling. ice tea tastes bad. then we went around berkeley, which is mostly poor and ghetto-looking with vagrants (one guy once stole my cousin's bike and sold it at a flea market) and smokers everywhere and iono why i want to go there anymore. we walked over this one block where they had a whole bunch of riots. hallowed ground. we talked about the recall and late night jokes ("at one point we were just 8 hours behind saddam. soon we predict to actually catch up to him, and actually pass him by as much as 2 hours. by then saddam will be chasing us"). then we drove home. i'm supposed to go help my cousin move today, and we kept on thinking of excuses to not go..."sorry, i have an important, um, chess meeting..."  today alex called me and i met up with him and erik at the isherwood bridge thingy, and alex tried to push me off. we walked to my house, where he beat me two more times in street but i got him the third time...with michael finley, kobe and t-mac! smaller ballers yo. then he kicked mine and erik's asses in timesplitters. then we went to school to meet natasha, sindy and gayzel, then walked to alex's house. on the way we, er, compared skin tones and i forgot what else. inside we watched jay and silent bob strike back. sheep fucker! then they looked at alex's backyard and got traumatized by fake deer. erik left to go to jenn's party, so we sat around and i tried to play guitar and failed miserably. they did friendster stuff. then natasha said alex was going out with gayzel, and i was like, bullshit. then alex said it, then he started laughing. but yes they are. we left to jack, on the way we saw a guy and girl lying down together in the field, they looked like a hobo haha. i saw the girls' bathroom at jack, much like their locker room...sacred territory...and gayzel saw the boys bathroom, she got scared and ran. we ate, sindy took out a white piece of lettuce and was like, "i don't like onions." then i tried to throw away everyone's food, sindy gave it to me but tried to take it back, natasha tried to take it back but gave it to me, gayzel refused, and i was just kidding with alex. then i tipped the workers like 5 cents on top of some other person's pennies and a wet straw.   we went back to my house. the girls found me and alex in our panaromic pic, i look so bad shit. i'm right next to richard, we're like twins. then we found all three of them in their panoramic pic..."wait sindy if you werent in the pic *points to her in the pic* is this your twin or something?" "of course!" my brother said he didnt notice the girls. yea right, unless he's gay or something. actually, that's a good possibility...then they looked in my photo album...AAAAAHHH...they kept on laughing about how i wrote captions for my pics. gayzel couldn't find me in a soccer pic, she kept on pointing at white kids and saying "is this you?" then sindy grabbed my patterson yearbooks even though she said only gayzel went to patterson. suspicious, no? natasha took my 8th grade thornton yearbook ("no! not the blue one!") and i tried to take it back. they were all lying on my bed, and i turned out the lights. haha. they kept on trying to have alex and gayzel sleep together, on top of each other, whatever. they wanted everybody to fuck each other and go together in closets and stuff. sindy kept on backing away from me. i found a bunch of pillows and the girls lay down on the floor, gayzel said it was hot. only cuz alex was there. i kept on trying to lie on alex but he...er...moved around. "stop ryan, you're getting me horny!" it got late, so everyone got off each other and put on their clothes and went to the backyard to get some peaches. "i don't like soft ones, only the hard ones." hahaha...they were about to leave, but natasha wanted me to hug sindy but sindy didn't seem to want to so alex kinda pushed me to her and she spilled her soda. lol o boy. but they left. fun stuff.   crapp, this is like how alex writes, except less funny. o yea, look at my subprofile too if you get the chance. bye for now.

        i enjoy the method by which you execute that particular action in that general vicinity   haha...i've been downloading songs like crazy, thanks to my blazingly fast 56k modem...no seriously, i've been reaching over 5 kb/s on kazaa (or  urlLink k++  mind you, which has no spyware and keeps your ip address as anonymous as possible, and yea the riaa can kiss off), so i've been catching up with the times yo. or...something...umm, it's been an interesting week. last week, my mom had her wedding in vegas, the city of bright lights, air-conditioned rooms, and porn cards (yes, adam was right for once). they offered them to me...wtf, kids are still innocent...i think. ran all the way to venetian (a mile+ down the strip) to take pics, causing my brother undue pain and suffering by waiting for himself listening serenely to marching band music. they now play the bellagio fountains to stupid pop songs from faith hill and shania twain. yippee. screw up a perfectly classy spectacle. i want ddr, it's fun, i suck. the 8 arrow version in the arcades is crazy though. soul calibur 2 is THE BEST. *drools unabatedly* my brother: "why do they call it round table buffet if all the tables are square?" we may never know...wedding...umm, it was interesting. me and my bro were the only "witnesses," so i felt kinda stupid. my mom's over 50 and she's eloping? gah. my brother dropped the ring, the priest looked like he was high, i was getting dizzy, and i carried my mom's purse like only true men do.  got home the next day through the vegas airport which is cool cuz it has trams carrying you from the main terminal to departure gates, and pathetic cuz a whopper sells for $2.95. we flew at 7 pm over the clouds, which looked like a giant blanket. it was really nice. then nothing big, upgraded my computer, diablo ii is fun as hell. assassin for life, bitch. me and erik sneaked into alex's house cuz his grandma left the garage door open, then took showers, changed clothes, ate dinner, mowed the lawn, and waited for alex to wake up. played basketball with erik and alex...i can jump higher for some ridiculous reason, or lack thereof. so i can dunk even on the 2nd lowest setting of alex's hoop. whee. went to blockbuster to buy adam's $20 gift card (which felt really cheap cuz basho got him warcraft 3: frozen throne for example) and i saw sarah mercado there. straange. she had jamba. it's a fad, just like being gay and the macarena. what's next, boneless cotton candy? (thank you daily show)  adam's party was fun. one of adam's cousins looks like richard, glasses and everything. except buffer. i drank roughly a dozen cans of soda, cuz i'm on sugar withdrawal...i barely eat processed foods. ditz the ritz. and stuff. adam played matrix music in all his spiky haired glory, kevin wanted to play alex's boxcar racer cd, pat stole the la-z-boy, basho gingerly touched my hair, erik murdered james in dynasty warriors 3 ("100 kills! go james!" when erik reached like 450), melissa came in and smacked ankur a lot. adam's room is cool, it has a jet li pic, a bazillion games ("they all suck" said melissa), teddy bear wallpaper he refuses to put down, that beaver that goes "kung fu fighting," etc. we played football (which was kinda crappy) and basketball ("you can be the hero! give iran something to be proud of!"), melissa kinda ripped kevin's cellphone a new one, but he needed a new faceplate anyway. she tried to make me then pat give flowers to some 7th grade girl, but instead she gave them to a guy named "tom tom" then ran back yelling "i did it! i did it!" smooth haha. went back inside, melissa was reading some girly magazine and we pointed out a few pics that owen might like (read: anything with a body part of a girl). she thought lucy liu looked like kat...ehh. the guys played soccer...haha pat slide tackled anything that moved, even the goalie. kevin kept on kicking it into the stands for no real reason. was it ankur...he'd always kick the ball 50 feet above the goalpost then complain his team was worse than pat's. cool stuff.   alex came over today to print stuff for biology, he annihilated me in street...21-3? but i broke his streak after 3, which he predicted. "uh oh, i won the tip..." maybe it was cuz he was listening to a star trek episode...who knows. oh, and random news:  urlLink arnold schwarzenegger is running for governor ! so is  urlLink gary coleman and d.l. hughley ...what has our state come to...whatever it is, it's pretty funny. go ahh-nold!

        miscellaneous   man, junior year snuck up on us without WARNING. just out of nowhere. it was a calm cool summer afternoon, and then from out of the skies a terrible omen surfaced..."school is starting." struck almost out of our wits by this fearsome prospect, the class of 2005 drew a collective breath and screamed..."why god why? why must we be subject to this inane, repetitive torture of tedium that will conclude with minimal to nonexistent benefit to our respective selves once testing is complete? why must we be relegated to status quo classwork that exhibits no originality or innovation to expedite our learning, that offers the same obsolete scholastic environment that our parents and grandparents endured, and presents us with a pittance of preparation for the potential prospect of paid...umm...career life? all, of course, being exacerbated by an outrageously unreasonable insistence on club involvement, which is generally considered a terrible barometer for future involvement in college activities or, for that matter, the real world. this has got to stop now; we won't accept this second-rate oversight of our futures anymore, dagnabbit!" well, maybe some people yelled out a few different words here and there, but the overall jist remained the same. ummm...anyway...  yeaa. last night i unleashed my rhyming skills of (insert exaggerated random adjectives here) to liss's chagrin. no matter how hard i tried, she SHOT my poems down with UNMITIGATED FURY...but if i drop out of school to be a (really bad) poet, she promised to do the cooking :-D yea umm today parisa punched me in the stomach. maybe she thought it was effective, but nuh uh. is that the best she got? huh? huh? just cuz those heels of hers made her taller than me, she's all bad now huh...actually i should be quiet or else she'll like fence me to death...i studied for the dates test for a grand total of an hour, and missed 3 total! yeehaw. and i forgot everything from that already. also, i applied for an academic block, and i (and most of you probably) can qualify after only TWO FUCKING YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL. don't you love how the system works?

        sleep is for the weak   you know i should really go to bed right now. but i don't feel like it, so yeah. i'm making a slaughter of sunny in fantasy football, mwahhaa. today was nothing special, sat home, watched football (holy shit the saints got the snot kicked out of them), blatantly ignored homework (havent started studying for the history dates test yet, go me). we ate at this korean "tofu house" in the san jose area, i had tofu obviously which was hella hot, but the ice cream was pretty good.   i'm going to start taking online driver's ed, i'm not sure where though. either  urlLink pegasus driving school ,  urlLink trafficschool.com  or  urlLink driversed.com ? yeaa. i'll be coming home earlier this week i imagine. no more limitlessly unproductive after-school stays for moi.

"yea it's a value, it adds balance...wait this is just cuz you're too lazy to color it in huh" "exactly!" after school said happy birthday to kevin, alex gave him a cool drawing of him (except his mouth has no teeth) with his striped shirt and two "hot" chicks next to him, tiffany was like "it looks like a cross between arnold schwarzenegger and a girl." kevin said that sophie gave him a present, what is it what is it, (i screwed this up, so alex dont bitch about it) does it have to do with sex, YES, is it a book about sex, yes you're close, is it playboy, no, is it porn, no, playboy is porn, really, penthouse, no, playgirl, eww no, blah blah, its a book about sex, i said that that was my second guess. tiffany jason kevin went home, i gave kevin a HUG OF DOOM AND PENULTIMATE INTROSPECTION (random words). me amanda adam went to the '05 skit writing, stuff about nascar racing cuz street racing is too corrupted for us impressionable HIGH FUCKING SCHOOLERS, they didn't use my genius idea for "uni-T-shirts" waah. went to jack, walked back, i biked home.   yabba dabba doo, then badminton, HELLA people came, hit around with ankur while pat made fun of both of us, rita came back from signing up with the navy hella crazy, company attention! about face! ready and...MARCH! yes i butchered it. gave liss my sweater to sleep on cuz she was tired from the senior picnic and going on a water ride 10 times =O, it was hella big on her and you couldnt see her shorts, haha ankur went off with that. hit around with her and rita, rita exhibited common symptoms of the alex syndrome ("i suck! i suck! man i suck!"). played more, james taught me serves and he was excessively nice i think, me and james lost to simran and alex on tiebreaker. stupid drills, pat's dad thinks we're SECOND GRADERS, no offense to pat you are cool, i'm getting today mixed up with yesterday, joann chang was there, she's going to do the 8-court design with her crazy architecture skillz. went outside, chi was violated by simran earlier, "i felt his thing!!" then his and liss's mom came like 30 minutes late, talked to alex etc, gave natasha my sweater, then everyone went home.  today, haircut which i thought was cool (styled) then ugly (washed) then cool (dry). badminton, don't wear muscle shirts around simran cuz he will TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU LIKE HE DID CHI. hit around with amita who was playing easy on me cuz she had karate earlier and felt sorry for my crappy abilities. singles is funner than doubles. did drills, ditched amita but she found me out and whacked me with a karate KICK OF BANANAS. then um, hit around with greg (need to learn: smashes, not hitting with the frame, picking birdie up with racket), i hit amita like 4 times (accident, i swear!) then greg hit liss like 4 times so she got angry, turned into the hulk, and twisted greg's head off. actually she just hit the birdie back but hey wasnt that more interesting? or maybe not. somewhere i played natasha and jun, natasha is pretty good, so i lost. me and alex played debbie and liss, liss hit each of us like 20 times. me and pat vs. liss and alex, we won straight sets wheee. alex and liss kept on talking trash, but i dug deep into my fountain of resources and let pat beat them. my serves were somewhat consistent, so i'm happy. then i played some girl and got bageled twice cuz i cant smash, then played with liss and she hit me about 10 more times, then everybody left, alex nearly ran me over in his aunt's car not really, and i got home.

        what the world needs now...   fun past few days. we have roughly 1.45 million times more homework than last year, oh well. life as a junior is required to involve as little fun as humanly possible. i wrote a lot but it's boring and long so i erased it. blah blah, spanish club mtg wed was boring, red cross had HELLA more people today, liss came over cuz she's the 11th grade rep then ankur turns on his centiwatts of charm: "you know who's been staring at the back of your shirt for 20 seconds? that's right, me!" haha...yea...joanna was sitting next to us, and ankur was like, "you know you should try to be pretty for halloween." then everyone left, liss adroitly squirmed when i tried to pick her up again so i FAILED. for the third time. after school me kevin alex got amanda's basketball, alex tossed it in the air and kevin caught it right before it hit katie something, and a girl's like, "if that hit katie, you're gonna find this foot far up your ass." stupid bitches.   we were stalking sophie, then she came out of the cafeteria and brought kevin in, so alex "followed kevin" around the cafeteria and ran into sophie flipping him off with hella long middle fingers. basketball with amanda, alex and kevin kept on groping each other and spitting. sophie and liss came and alex was like, "KEVIN'S NOT HERE!! HE'S OVER THERE!" sophie came back with kevin and i said is she flipping you off so alex yelled "you're not flipping me off are you!!" alex and amanda played horse, and amanda was first to ho, hor, hors, and horse. then kevin called to get my bike, but he couldn't unlock the lock, so alex is like "you can bring the bike rack with you." so kevin came, we all talked, and kevin and amanda left so me and alex walked home. we watched the freshman football game, and alex is like, maan i wanna play. but the freshmen team sux, they never pass, they can't run, they can't juke, they can't punt. then we went home. and i got a badminton racket, it's a crappy 90 g wilson titanium POWER racket, but wahtever, my dad keeps on saying "the racket's cheap but it's still probably too good for you." psht. that's a good way to motivate your kids.

        badmington   is fun fun fun. alex and erik walked over to my house at 3 so i came with them to open gym at school, "hey you" was there to coach us uneducated pricks. pat greg kenny alex gave me some tips, alex was a trainer person which is something he usually doesn't do. amita was murdering ankur, she says its cuz of her tennis skillz but i think she might've been a badminton superstar in a past life. pat makes it look so damn easy! grrr. damn him and his many years of dedicated practice. i played a doubles game with liss and all i could do was serve badly, then kenny murdered me, then a miracle happened, and i learned how to kinda sorta hit. so me and liss became a force of nature, winning by like 15-12 and stuff over kimchi (fellow track emigrant) and vivian. liss and chi hit the birdie hella hard, but, he learned it from liss so its ok. i apparently tried some wesley hits but i didn't land so great. then i challenged alex and got wiped on the floor. then erik and alex went to jack, so i talked to james (the next ronald! goddamn he's so busy) and walked home. my legs are sore now, and my arms to a certain degree, but i really enjoyed it, so i'm finally going to do it this year. sorry tracksters. well it's not like i'll be missed, but hey, they are cool people. the logan meet in the rain...messing up all of the track lines...tapioca...spring break workouts...good times.  i'm an uncultured poo :( hey, what's new?

        like the spanish?   yes. i have a huge revelation to make concerning the layout of my blog: i changed the date format! whee. i was trying to do french, but it still said mercredi and septembre and stuff. i'm pretty sure that isn't french, but who really knows. and i tried to do chinese, but that means every time all three of you visitors look at my blog you have to change the font encoding. bah. this is easier.  anyway, kinda strange funky day yesterday. the night before i spent about 2 hours working on the  urlLink xanga of angah , so it looks all pretty and glossy with a nice sheen finish. school, we had a history test bah (test stupid, but me and ankur got most of the same answers so either we both aced or both failed), science bah (see a pattern?), lunch me and adam checked out the blog in the library, lights went out in mandarin yay...or was that thursday? it's all a blur to me. art finished our block still life thingy, i liked it, i added a weird ugly vase (vahz). me erik and jen talked about spicy food or something. then tiffany amanda stephanie cheryn erik eugene etc went to sushi or togo's at the hub, the azn kids wanted sushi but the caucazn kid wanted white food. white food! haha. i stayed to help tam joanna matt put away about 13 trillion book covers, owen came just to be worthless and take up space, everyone put on parkas when belinda came, and kat stopped by to laugh at how dumb nhs was to buy 13 trillion book covers and express our undying fear of coach t.   i biked home, ate dumplings, read the newspaper haha, alex then pat called me to come play football but i was tired and went to sleep. amanda called and i decided to come. alex is still faster than me though, damn. he grabbed adam then like, hugged him and nearly kissed him. kevin came and got thorns on his ass, pat started 3 flies up with a water bottle but alex caught it and drank it. liquor store, i sat on gum; blockbuster, pat kept on saying how wrestling sux (conveniently forgetting my scintillating wrestling rpi in 9th grade). natasha gayzel and sindy came, natasha wasn't wearing very much haha, cuz she sat on paint or something but you couldnt even see it (unlike amanda's shorts). went outside, i lay down on grass, kevin tried to run me over with his bike and pat stomped me, then he tied his shoe in the middle of the street. went to bike racks, alex got a foot cramp, pat had a toe cramp. sindy kept on running and screaming cuz the grass was poking thru her shoes? me and natasha threw a football around (which she dropped half the time). everyone sat down, then when natasha got up she left this huge butt print, so gayzel quickly got up and messed up the grass so you couldnt see hers. walked to alex's house, some jackass hick honked at us while we were crossing the bridge. we passed a dead squirrel or something, adam gleefully pointed out the ants eating at its head. in alex's house i tossed that annoying "merry cah-RIS-MUS" santa doll, and watched espn nfl football 2k4 which looked pretty good.   went home, after dinner i got online and talked to my cousin who wants me to take a bullet for her but then she'll step on my body (ungrateful angela ;-;), and liss who was flaunting her laptop computer of infinite envy. she made me take some personal attraction test, but, i didnt score that high haha. 68/100. o well. still got better than her so its ok :-D

        disorganized potpourri   the last few days have been pretty cool. rush week = lots of hang out time with cool people. ankur today was just smashing tiffany lennon in a religion/atheist war. everyone knows life came from bacteria that fell off a comet. yeaaa. i got to try (and fail) to pick up liss twice, but like they always say, third time's the charm. besides, she's not that heavy. or is she...you can never tell...i think my sunglasses (actually, i found them in weissenborn but nobody claimed them, so they're not really mine, so alex can't make me keep them) scared her (hinted by her saying "those are scary"), but they looked really uber on amanda and cheryn. cheryn wants to surreptitiously slip the sunglasses into alex's backpack cuz she doesn't like wearing them. i'll distract him then...go!!  math, yawn...english was funny today. menagerie...we created a veritable disorganized potpourri of tone words today. history, haha weissenborn was saying what if she was a child of a master and slave, andrew's like, "so you're the son of the slave rite..." ankur or somebody: "daughter, stupid!" chem is death, but the time puncher is worth our pain. oh, what boundaries 21st century technology have crossed...mandarin, we did presentations, damn howell grades so easy. some freshmen forgot their poster for their moon festival presentation and DIDN'T prepare, the lowest individ. score they got was 18/20. wtf. so my group tried for nothing. god damn. eugene, serena, tiffany, stephanie, thanks again for all the hard work though. art, we're drawing still art, cory was like, "it's not cheating. i call it...researching." he's cool. he thinks we've got the mental faculties of 5th graders though.  WRESTLEMANIA XIX IS UBER. UBER. UBER. UBER. UBER. f-5 like burning. oh yea, i joined adam and basho's blog. xanga of angah. clever wordplay, no? check it out sometime if you wish.   projected senior classes  physics honors ap calc bc ap stat art 2 ap eng 12 ap govt/econ

        thank you alex   obviously this is from his birthday party. he mentioned rishi's bday, so i looked at this pic as it was loading (and it takes forever, BELEE DAT), i was thinking, wow, rishi's house looks a lot like alex's. then i was like...oh...it is alex's house. don't ask what simran's doing. please. for the love of god. o yea, there was another pic with alex sitting on simran's lap, but he didn't post it, shucks. let's see more of that leg!   anyway, go to alex's xanga. it is good. *points to links* but if you suffer from chronic neck fatigue or whatever and you can't tilt your head for fear of it cleaving off... urlLink here you are, you lazy jackass  :-D

        rip    urlLink john ritter dies    urlLink johnny cash dies   erik says it's old news, but still, it really shocked me. they were amazing performers and people, and we were blessed to be graced with their talent for the time they were given to share it with us. may they rest in peace.  what else...i am tired. stupid school. i walked around school during the dance, coach t saw me in the parking lot, he yelled "what are you doing? why are you here?" i said i was going home, i was just listening to my music, totally innocent, so he grabbed at straws..."don't walk through the cars! walk where i can see you!" what, am i some sort of juvenile delinquent or something? bastard. then i passed by the bleachers, singing along to my songs, acting really stupid, then i saw two kids on the bleachers...needless to say i ran away REALLY FAST.

        it's the day again   september 11, 2003. two years removed from ground zero. i would write something again but it's pointless and i don't have the time anyway. if anyone remembers, i made my newer subprofile just for this purpose last year, but i can't access it and my written copy is in my portfolio. hulk mad. rage. grrrr. it was disappointing that so few people at our school cared, but oh well. we're 4000 miles away, it doesn't even matter to us. we still had a short but respectable ceremony. hopefully everybody can take some time from their day, just a few seconds, to remember.  ummm, my grandma got discharged from the hospital today, she is in a new, obscenely expensive (the price would gouge your eyes clear out of their sockets) SUPER DUPER SHNAZZY SHEEZY INFLATABLE AIR BED OF BOUNCY POWER. my uncle raymond is here again to look after her, which is coolio. and my cousin jill might come over if she wants to and if she can somehow find us. that would reek of awesomenessosity.  yesterday continued the trend of total sucktitude, but today was alright. my first fun day of art. some kid showing our sub mrs. johnson a drawing: "i'm not a good drawer." mrs. johnson: "i can tell." then this freshman ramon that sits at my table, "what does gullible mean?" me: "uhh...intelligent." "really?" then mrs. johnson accused him of staring at this other freshman abdullah, "please, save the dating until after school." after school said hi to a very stressed kat (i...i will survive...!), promised to say a one-word eulogy a day for 300 days for debbie if she dies (that's...carry the two...200 words), and got some uber grape candy from liss, who is a significant cause of global warming.  part of my spiffy tone essay: "American High School is a fine place to go to for kids with long dreams and longer odds of reaching them. The claustrophobic in everyone will delight in the constant crowdedness of the facilities; we have 400 kids too many, which is less than Mission, which has slightly enough population to apply for statehood. Exercise-averse teenagers need not fret either, for we are the only school in the district to boast the revolutionary Closed Campus(tm) feature! This results in delightly long lines for food, giving waiting customers enogh time for quick tasks like finishing homework, taking naps, or watching the first 3 seasons of The Sopranos. And for that slighted Amish population, we boast working restrooms. For that rare time where you need to use the restroom."

        cellphone!!   i have a cellphone finally! well, technically it's not mine, we're supposed to "share" it. bs. we're the last people outside of the amish to get a cellphone, and we can't even have our own? whee. still, it's at&t, foldable, better than nothing. or is nothing better? hmmm...  what else, i guess cuz yesterday was so cool today just had to suck. so it did. nothing major, just a bunch of small dumb things snowballing. and my brother is stupid...dad: "clean the table!" brother: "maybe if you stop telling me to." god...5th grade logic...what kind of brother do i have?

        damn junior year   will i have time to update this anymore? stupid homework. if i have free time i'd rather go on aim or something...i'm even giving up videogames =O i want wrestlemania xix like BURNING though. waah. well i guess this is goodbye again, for the time being? i might just do weekend updates, but i probably won't remember anything interesting, if i remember anything period. all i can say is, sykes is STUPID, history test was ok, mandarin is fun, english is fun, math is boring, and in art i feel really antisocial. i just want to draw, and it's annoying when stupid freshmen try to talk to me and call mr. cory gay and stuff. but today was a cool day.  hmm, might as well. michelle branch for inspiration? *smacks self*  could you look me in the eye and tell me that you're happy now could you end it like that, brush me to the side and tell me you're moving on, just growing up it happens to everybody, even you why resist the inevitable it's like telling the sun to stop rising like telling the birds to stop flying so again the march of time trudges on leaving me alone in its wake swallowing this pill, this dose of reality like I never needed the medicine in the first place yet it is still bitter, yet it still hurts yet still I sit there lost, my vision blurred clouded, by the truth and nothing more life is a funny thing they tell you to open your heart for them but what do you do when nobody wants to take it  could you look me in the eye and tell me that you haven't changed and tell me that you're gone and will never come back

        school...!   ahhh. i really don't feel like a junior. hell, i don't feel like a sophomore, the summers were just so frickin short. and some of the freshmen make me feel REALLY frickin short. on top of the fact that there is like a million of them, give or take a few hundred thousand. you can't move in the halls, it's like...a bunch of sludge trying to squeeze into a dime-sized hole. or something like that, nice and cutely metaphorical. well, after 90 minutes of lovely weissenborn notes, i can write this. joy. first impressions...  got my schedule before school, brady for precal, took a boring-ass diagnostic test that i did ok on. why oh why can't we just correct it at school...yea, it was so complicated only berkeley statisticians can properly analyze a frickin DIAGNOSTIC test. and i'm pinned against the wall with a crappy desk so my elbow can't rest comfortably on the table. still, seems ok but brady's personality doesn't rub off on me. belinda...so far away...brown for eng ap, apparently we have two books to read and a million essays in return. whee for us. the guy dresses sharp and knows his stuff, but he's got such an annoying monotone. stupid birds essays. i wrote some bs about "it is a rare gift to watch these kings of the skies soaring through their celestial kingdom...the mere sight of their inimitable majesty and splendor is a treasure that few will ever have the honor to see"...yes i'm full of it. that's why people hate ap tests. with a PASSION that transcends...ok i'll shut up. brunch, adam made fun of something about the date...i don't know. siegel's a supervisor! and he almost got fired cuz the big spinning viewing ride thing almost broke under his watch. spookay.  us history ap, FUN FUN FUN. weissenborn is a cool teacher, simran is a FUNNY MAN. "we can't have meetings in the rotunda anymore." simran: "why?" took roll, got some spiffy shiny books, yup. chem ap, 17 kids!! we are an embarrassment to an embarrassing school. "try to remember everything you learned, because we don't have time to reteach it this year." ankur: "it's ok, we only need like, a month to learn it again anyway." lunch, we made fun of erik's offensive offense and jason for...being jason. mandarin 3, howell, i felt like such a whitewashed loser. i sorta understood her, not that it was fast but that it was too many new words. stupid freshmen think they're so bad cuz they're in high school...one of eugene's linkees kept on yelling out "your mom was good!" and gay old crap like that. we get to use tape recorders, interesting..."we're going to need to buy rice paper." eugene: "can you eat it?" art, BORING as hell, cory is strange but not to the exponential extent of miller, da. nobody laughed to his jokes but jen thinks it's just cuz our class is full of people that don't care. i like the guy's teaching methods though, his emphasis on effort and not forcing us to do anything. the kids in architecture kept laughing, i kinda want it but i don't like models. i was happy cuz art is now only 2d work, i'm not big on sculpture etc. then erik showed off his smashed finger, o0o0o0o0.  after school was fine, talked to people, simran tried to rape kevin again but failed again. i THOUGHT parisa's phone was a cameraphone, silly me. helped adam, richard b and basho bring govt. books for lafferty..."i pity the fool who gets lott for history." then saw ira and samyak off, hung out with amanda while she exercised (dedication!), then yea that's about it.

        *expletive deleted*   school tomorrow!! *expletive deleted* damn. where did it go? no, seriously. someone STOLE all the extra days right from our grasp. waah. evil time speeding up during our teenage years...uhh today, got the sutures from my wisdom teeth operation removed, saw my grandma, biked back and near my house alex honked at me from his car but i thought it was somebody on the other side of the road who was driving too slow, then i got home and opened the garage door and guess who's right there on the driveway. then his grandma used the restroom and he went to pick up natasha and gayzel. i wanna drive. then i biked back to borders to buy ceremony (which i'm not gonna read tonight, thank you) and i saw my again at washington mutual, except there was a security officer there so i was scared and decided to pretend reading a packet about a savings account or something. then i got home and talked to minakshi who lives across the street about evil french and evil chem and all that good stuff. that's about it.

        class of 2004: road trip seniors   ah might as well finish this. before anything else, the seniors are really cool! now, i'll be nice and succinct: unimpressive. disappointing. formulaic. senioritis strikes again for this drawn-out, mellow rally. once again, the seniors reminisce uninspiredly about their past years of high school, we have a possibly interesting rap rendered unintelligble by our cheap mics and speakers, alex carabello does the worm and mistakenly thinks he's cool, the seniors try (and fail) to make fun of the other classes (except for the parking joke, haha, i didnt find out what it was till later but i laughed anyway), mr. miller takes off his shirt (no coconuts ;-;). too bad the music kept screwing up for their guys' dance, but it wasn't too impressive anyway, at least when juxtaposed to that uber personification of awesomeness that was the junior guys' dance. and they unzipped their jackets? one: the guys in the audience immediately lose all respect for them. two: its not like they were much to look at anyway. haha. the step dance has lost all its appeal in my opinion (stepping to grindin' was so cool last year), though the girls' dance was a redeeming factor. sadly all the dances showcased the phenomenon known as "lack of preparation-itis." even the rotunda decoration and march seemed somewhat uninspired and half-spirited. only the lucid colors of the gateway poster could save the entire '04 presentation from being banished to eternal mediocrity. but we all know they still won though. i will commend the valiant effort on behalf of the road trip seniors, if not their somewhat shoddy execution. uhhh, the seniors are really cool!

        class of 2005: fast track juniors   first, ADSCJIOSDFJiosdjf. shit i could've done the guys' dance. iosefjosefj. that's a word, you know. actually, no it's not. and holy crap hitting against the wall is boring. i so need to play somebody. and skits in mandarin are fun. shuen wu kong, wo hen ben! *jumps around*  wow, damn those juniors are good huh. what is there to say about us? the march thing was sufficiently pointless, the profuseness of our shirt was commendable, and holy hell we had a cool skit. cool cool cool. mr. brady v. mr. losson was pretty funny, especially how losson kept on checking his arm for his lines. and our dances. grrr! the girls were pretty good, but the guys. grrr! that could've been me up there, sefiojosfe. nevertheless, they had some awesome and unique ideas (the "resurrection") and it was just fun to watch. and they said the juniors were unprepared. and they wonder why the seniors are watching their backs...because you know '05 is comin' down the fast track...

        class of 2006: safari sophomores   hmmm, it's pretty hot outside. i don't give a damn. you have to play in any weather...to get better, you have to want it.  sophomores! the babies (yes, still babies) bedecked in blue. the not-as-young brats trying to prove they outgrew their freshmen jitters and rough edges, trying to show that they are already capable of competing with the big kids. we were just like them last year, not so long ago. i could go on for days about last year, which was fun in its own ways, but i digress. anyway, the sophomores seem to have smelled blood -- the alleged lack of preparedness by the junior and senior classes -- and thus they struck hard today. with unprecedented involvement for a 2nd-year class, they put together a decent SAC decoration and wowed a lot of onlookers with their disorganized potpourri of dance numbers. the plot was forgettable and meandered endlessly, and some of their roughly 22,324 dances came out of nowhere ("we found the teacher! alright, let's go dance!"), but i was impressed by each one. the choreography was challenging enough (the robot!!!!!11oneone), their numbers were formidable, and their preparation was easily noticeable. sadly they ran into the sophomore brick wall -- we're so cool, we're not freshmen anymore, we can breakdance! oh wait, damn, it's "gang-related," because you know how a gang has no street cred unless it can breakdance ("let's breakdance fight!")...i swear i want to kill the school administration sometimes. closed campus, music restrictions, grrrfuck. but again i ramble. so, though they tried too hard, the class of '06 poured a lot into their rally, and it showed. congrats to what may be our 2nd-place finishers, the safari sophomores.

        class of 2007: flashback freshmen   i think it would be kinda cool for me to do some little overview of each of the classes in honor of the conciliatory (you heard that right, haha) spirit of spirit week. before that, bitching time(tm)! spirit week decorations are in the damn student activity center, mrs. howell is a bitch ass, mr. brown is stupid, my classes are still boring, yahoo fantasy sports is down, and i accomplished nothing today. thank you...that has been a presentation of bitching time(tm).  ok. freshmen. the rebels in red. the cute (or not so cute) n00bs of high school. they are pretty surprising to say the least; while half of them indeed look like little kids, the other half are as big as the rest of us. damn 21st century eating habits. there are roughly more of them than there are holes in swiss cheese. and they are fairly active. sure they're really green (clumsy class chant, throwaway skit, subpar guys' dance, change of theme, no shirt) but they put some energy into what they do (much like those pesky sophomores, but that's another day). they aren't overwhelmed by this newfound pressure; they seem to pride themselves in meshing into the community, learning how things get done, finding the restrooms, etc. not to mention they're good badminton players! well...some of them. obviously the problem is some of them don't show proper deference to their upperclassmen or teachers, but that's the breaks. so a hearty kudos from me to the cabbage patch...er...flashback freshmen.

        are those sinks too?   what a strange day. i don't like doing recaps but oh well. first as i was biking to big 5 to buy some birdies some blind bitch who was driving out of an alley didn't slow at the sidewalk as i was passing by and she hit me at like 20 mph. bitch. haha, it was funny cuz i didn't get it hurt and she was like..."no I'M sorry, are you ok?" i showed her that her license plate was knocked off. "no i don't care about that, are YOU alright?" came back, i wanted to hit against the wall outside the american gym but i ran into '05 painting the sheds next to the track. it was hot but fun, everyone drove each other's car, thi and jesha stole my bike and rode off into the dust-infested sunset, jen worked out her supermodel muscles painting a shed white with the long pole paint roller (me to alex m: "normally i wouldn't touch you with a 12 foot pole, but considering i have one here"), alex drove by kicking up dust and turned the shed brown. o yea, i had hella dreams last night, like the one where everyone was on this huge bed of kat's wishing her happy birthday like some sort of ceremony, another this freshman in my art class was crying, same dream pat made fun of my buddy list screenname by screenname, another the ravens killed some other team in football, then i woke up and thought it was sunday. then we cleaned up the paint in the boys' bathroom (tiffany: "can we use those sinks too?" "...those are urinals") and i went home.

        soapbox alert   let me complain about history really fast. how are we ever going to really learn from the past if (just like today's georgia v. cherokee "debate") the teacher and the book just shoves the politically correct side of the story down our throats? we're supposed to see it from "their" perspective...yeah...when the book devotes like a paragraph to the whites' justification. not that they were right, but if we actually learned why they thought they were right we might get something useful from all of this. also, and no offense, but why is there so many of these pointless packets about working women? wow...they went to mills...they got pregnant less often...the book devotes so many paragraphs to these marginal topics when men doing the same thing wouldn't be worth a footnote. except for the  urlLink pregnant  part.

        college night   was quite exhilirating. yup. i got to school, ran into amanda, dropped my bike off to catch a spot in this crazy-long line that stretched halfway to canada, tested out my ekx (elyse kirker experiment) about four times successfully (although we can still work on reaction time...haha jp...), tailed the j-lo look alike rita (who dissed us juniors for being annoying, but we won't take that lying down anywhere...we'll take it sitting down), tailed my personal armrest gloria who signed up for this one college that has videogame stuff, saw chris wong's homecoming nomination sheet (skills: "sleepy, king of procrastination"), talked with amanda about snot rockets and perky people and other profound things (i didn't get jumped everybody, so stop the celebrating), and ran into liss just as she got picked up by her weird blind mom. then i went home. must do homework...

        slow week   hmmm it's been an ok week, even though it's basically just past weeks copy-pasted over each other. math is still way too slow, english (with the exception of acting out the crucible...whore! whore!) is a waste of time, history (with the exception of arguing over modern issues that few in the class have even passing knowledge about) is pointless, chemistry is RETARDED (except for making fun of my footrest, gloria...haha...). lunch is now a chore because of the following conflicts of mine:  [+] i want to eat, not because i'm hungry necessarily, but i want food. something satisfying...? yea, but then i want to save money for christmas. so i don't buy food. but then sometimes i can't resist, and i buy food anyway. like today. my fortitude has failed me yet again... [+] sometimes if i want to talk to people (which isn't terribly often, but it happens) they're engrossed in one of those stupid 10-people group conversations in which two people talk and everybody laughs awkwardly then the same two people talk and one person jumps in here or there but they don't really get involved in the discussion and so the people with nothing to talk about stare and try to look like they're enjoying themselves so if someone sees them it looks like they're part of a big group. it's always the same. or even if someone's in a small, sensible group of 2 or 3 or a thousand, why bother them? yea. [+] i want to do homework because i've been taking up calculus (which is challenging and FUN and presently my favorite subject, please shoot me now) but the library's always full and i want solitude when i work. yup. i'm impossible. [+] some days a big group thing like basketball is fun, but they SUCK when it's the same three, four, whatever people out there playing every day. only when it's organized and a lot of people play and the game's relaxed then it's worth it to come. and we haven't played basketball at all this year. [+] club meetings are worthless, as are basically every club (no offense to you officers out there). why colleges even care is beyond me. i've spent long hours cleaning the house, helping my dad do chores, showing dedication and responsibility but schools don't give a shit about that. only if it relates to extracurricular activities...blah blah...  oh well, so yes lunch sucks. anyway, mandarin's alright if only because i want to speak well and howell (who nonetheless assigns more work than...um...a lot of teachers) is better than the white demon crack-infested hyper fiend from hell that is mr. miller. art is COOL. cory's like an ideal teacher, he's knowledgeable, he doesn't mince words, he doesn't condescend to us (except to assume we can't draw lines), he thinks of some interesting projects, his classroom is relaxed, and he can TEACH. only thing i hate is how he is madly in love with notetaking from videos older than he is, when it serves no practical purpose whatsoever.  what else, today afterschool me alex cheryn and joanna went to jack in the box to eat, the girls only want me and alex just so we can carry their stuff. maan girls are so violent, cheryn slaps hard...well actually she didn't, but she says she can. damn alex beat me in fantasy football...i was up by 20! oh well. we went back to school and kevin met us and we had fun with cheryn's water bottle. again. college night tonight...go go go go everybody.

RAMS BEAT THE PACKERS. woot squared. isaac bruce was tearing it up, congrats to him on 10,000 yards. and the niners won too, pretty surprising. owens still has crappy hands. and my stupid fantasy team, thrash got NO YARDS, galloway got NO YARDS, calico got 20 yards. bitch fuckers. i'm still beating alex though, haha. tomlinson busted out today, and domanick davis was pretty crazy too.  oh yea, i want our class t-shirt. it looks so sexy. and i drove today! sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool.

        ummm   gah...sorry about the last few posts, i've been complaining about alot of things lately when i really shouldn't be. i hate feeling like that...well, sometimes...but hmmm, if i have nothing to bitch about then i have nothing to write about. that sucks. oh well...today was cool i guess. boring math test, focus was alright (tiffany and mei couldn't spell colin powell...it's like colin farrell!...), boring history lecture, boring spanish club meeting (bonding time with my brother), boring brushwriting in mandarin. after school me rita and amanda tried to get tommy to do the hula? but it didn't work, sadly. i cruelly stole liss's backpack, she asked pat to get it back so he tried to pants me but ha! my pants aren't 10 sizes too big like half the other guys in school! i'm unpantsable! hahahkkaak...er...yea...then hung out with alex cheryn and joanna, cheryn covered alex's head with his hood so he looked like a...umm...never mind. then he tried to lick everybody. and joanna tried to get us to catwalk (family matters! ba-boom, ba-boom...nobody knows what i'm talking about...), happy to say she was very unsuccessful. i want to play badminton. i want a new racket. !!

        can you take it all away   songs can get to me i guess. like, i wanted to post something but then my playlist played "blurry" -- puddle of mudd and i felt all weird and stuff. oh well. today i woke up at 10 and wanted to go get a card for tiffany but i think my computer screen's magnetically attached to me, so i was stuck surfing for no particular reason at the most boring sites. then eventually we went to get a card and pick up alex and kevin for tiffany's party, which was fun even though we didn't stay very long. i can't blow balloons worth crap. kinda sad really. alex and kevin suck at ddr. even i'm better than them, but yea. stupid back arrow. jason is good...amanda was kinda stumbling...amita was good. she was getting down like that crazy dancing fiend she is. tiffany was c-walking like a BIG BALLER! except...little...and amanda and alex were trying to breakdance, kevin got a really good pic of them. it's like they're standing on their heads. then we played some little kid's uno with cards roughly the size of rhode island, then real uno, i tried to play with my feet but that didn't work too well. my dad picked us up to go to open gym, my and jen wong drove in, alex was talking about how so many girls can drive compared to boys. interesting huh? yea not really...  we got to the gym and me kevin and ankur did workouts under the oversight of drill commander super liss. pretty pointless, then i played a doubles game with kenny against liss and kanika, omg i was such crap. then me and liss hit against the wall and the wall barely won, then i played against some guy (not my dad lol...) and i finally learned how to smash, which made me really happy. i can't aim, but hey it's a start. then i hit with alex and did some weird impossible shots, then me and liss played alex and some beginner, and we won, alex and liss had these big blisters and alex kept on moaning in pain all the time. alex smashed me in the chest and i like convulsed and died, so liss said she'd get him back (my hero :P), but then she smashed the net instead. then me and alex vs. liss and the guy, we lost. then me and the guy played kim and some girl, we got pounded to a sparkly finish on the floor. and that's about it, pat: "isn't it strange to bike home in the dark?" "nah, i'm walking." "isn't it strange to walk home in the dark?" and i got home and showered and talked in really broken chinese with my grandma's caretaker, but at least i understood most of it.

NOW. it is that good.   i came back from erik's game today. we did alright, won 13-7. erik didn't play much but he had a nice pulling tackle on some guy. stevie reyes on the other hand...erm, well, we should've lost because kennedy was better, but they had a couple of interceptions, a fumble, and a holding call that nullified a go-ahead touchdown. how sad. fun time, it was cold and alex froze to death in his shirt. me with my ipod that can hold only 2 songs!...2 five-gigabyte songs...the second song gets really good at the 1,250th minute. then natasha and sindy tried to get their binders but some custodian bitch told us to leave. asshole.  umm tomorrow tee-fah-nee's party for about 2 hours, and then open gym. finally! after all these years...

        he's  urlLink bahck    congratulations to arnold schwarzenegger, the new governor of cah-lee-FOH-nee-ah. how crazy. last november when california "re-elected" gray davis (it was a plurality, remember), who would've thought that in 11 short months he'd be kicked out for a b-movie actor...who just happens to be a republican married into the frickin kennedy family. interesting...chilly davis being replaced by mr. freeze. if anything else, the next three years should be interesting, and arnold's admittedly qualified group of advisors is a plus. the overwhelmingly democratic legislature will try as hard as they can to vaporize arnold's naive beliefs that he can really reform sacramento, but i believe popular support rallied by arnold will get some important legislation through. so please people, ronald reagan was an actor, so have some faith and don't bitch about leaving the state because of this.  for my part, i was initially as excited as anybody else over arnold running when he announced his candidacy on the tonight show, cuz davis imo is just as incompetent or even worse than george w. bush (at least bush has charisma), AND davis is just a career politician (see gray! see gray's job on the line! see gray suddenly sign 20 bills to appease the liberals whom he ditched after they paid millions to reelect him!). i was temporarily swayed against arnold by his ugly showing at that jerry springer episode they dared to call a debate; he was making bad pre-scripted jokes, talking over bustamante and huffington, and not really showing much depth on the issues. however, the harassed women stories (which were known for months, but the times just released it last week) annoyed me so much that i jumped back on the arnold bandwagon. even if it is true that he committed those acts, how in the hell does that affect his competency to govern this state? because of a stupid MOVIE quote? then the final straw was the NAZI quote. for christ's sake, it was almost 30 years ago and taken out of frickin contest. around 20% of the people voting today weren't even alive back then. and some retarded college student who thinks she's all bad cuz she read about it on the onion has the nerve to say it scares her? that arnold may be...gasp...evil? go live in a landfill or something.  here's hoping the reign of the governator actually gets something done. (can anybody say jesse ventura?) and cruz bustamante sucks.

        rip mr. vares   i didn't know the man, never talked to him. it obviously didn't affect me as much as others when he passed away. however, many of you probably knew him well, and took the news a bit harder. so as a much-belated gesture, i would like to offer my condolences to rob vares and his family. he seemed like a really nice guy everytime i saw him at school last year, and the following simply exemplifies it.    urlLink Rob Vares, 58, popular teacher, coach in Fremont   by Lisa Fernandez, Mercury News  Rob Vares, a popular Fremont teacher and coach whose 35-year career and life was remembered this week with cheerleaders, Elvis, the Cal fight song and hundreds of friends, has died of kidney cancer.  Mr. Vares was diagnosed in mid-August, the same month he celebrated his 58th birthday and 30-year anniversary with his wife, Sherri.  About 700 people attended the upbeat memorial -- Mr. Vares hated funerals, his family said. High school cheerleaders, Elvis and Jimmy Buffett tunes, and a family video highlighted the service.  "I always knew he had influence on me,'' said his 26-year-old son, Toby of Costa Mesa, who followed in his father's footsteps and became a teacher. "But his hard work was appreciated by hundreds of people. He taught us not just about school, but the game of life. He basically grew boys into men and girls into women.''  Mr. Vares was born in Oakland and attended Fremont's Washington High School, graduating in 1963 with the "White Sweater Athlete Award,'' which means he had nine varsity letters. During high school, he played varsity baseball, basketball and football for three years. It is a distinction his 24-year-old daughter, Shea, also earned -- the only father-daughter team to earn this title, family members said.  After high school, Mr. Vares attended Fresno State on a baseball scholarship and earned his teaching credential a year after he graduated. Toby Vares said his father loved the UC-Berkeley Golden Bears.  He was hired in 1968 at Washington High, teaching physical education and social studies, later becoming assistant principal at American High School in 1985 for a short time. In 1988, he took a job at Lincoln High School in San Jose for a semester, but returned to Fremont because he didn't like the commute and wanted to spend more time with his family, his son said.  In 1993, Mr. Vares was vice principal of Centerville Junior High in Fremont, and since 2002 had been the vice principal of American High. For the last 11 years, he also had been the commissioner for the Mission Valley Athletic League.   Robert F. Vares Jr.  Born: Aug. 23 1945, in Oakland Died: Sept. 27 2003, in Fremont Survived by: Wife, Sherri Vares of Fremont; son, Toby Vares of Costa Mesa; daughter, Shea Vares of Sacramento; mother, Ann Vares of Hayward. Memorial: Donations should be sent to the Rob Vares MVAL Sports Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 5191 Mowry Ave., Fremont, Calif. 94538.

        BASKETBALL   is now my favorite sport. period. whether it's watching or playing...unless it's the rams, i could care less about the nfl now. i don't know why, maybe it's because personalities and playing styles are much more developed and distinct than in football...i think i enjoy the added focus on individualism in basketball as opposed to the plodding teamwork of football. or something like that. it makes me want to play nba street again. FUN GAME. i was playing with the suns and i lost twice in a row to the spurs by like 2 points, GRRR...i won the third game which made me happy. penny owned every game...one game he had, 13 points, a block and 3 steals. the only thing that really bites about the game (as alex knows) is that gilbert arenas, along with the warriors in general, is utter trash. cruel world...

        up and down   today wasn't too bad...at 12:40 i biked to round table near forest, got there at 1 SHARP to wait for gloria like she said but she was 20 minutes late, but she had a sexy yellow bike so it's ok. then we went to coyote hills, and she talked about her videogames and made fun of badminton a lot (!!), and we checked out stuffed animals in the museum. we came back the LONG way through the creek and she busted out her crazy harry potter rumor skills. then open gym...let's see why it sucked. one: it was at irvington, nobody ever goes to those. two: we didn't even play games, we only had space to play on half-courts. three: without someone to coach me personally, i can't improve anymore...i've had plenty of practice, but no technique. THAT SUCKS. i wanna be good. oh well, then i waited outside with alex natasha and gayzel (whose uncle drives slower than antoine walker...stupid joke), and alex lay face-down on the ground and sat on his zipper...haha, they know what i'm talking about.

        happy thanksgiving   i think, on thanksgiving day 2003, i've decided to be annoyingly traditional and list all the minor inconsistencies of life that i'm thankful for. (remember kiddies, thanksgiving was NOT invented as a prelude to christmas shopping.) it would be cool if other people did the same, but hey, it's not like i'm a trendsetter or anything. (yes  urlLink james , i'm doing it anyway :-D)  first there's the obvious things...  + friends...i can't say enough about you guys, friends make life worth living...yes that's pretty damn cheesy, shut up and read more... + family...even when they seem annoying as hell, they're always doing things with you in mind, they've been through a lot of strife and hardship to bring you up, and sometimes we kids don't understand that + being here in america...yea i told that to ira, it sounds stupid...haha...but i mean, we could've been born in africa with aids and extreme destitution, or worse, we could be born in FRANCE + and from america we have abundance...whether it be food, money, space, freedom (as opposed to say, taiwan where you have 8 hours of school and tutoring and blah blah)...we're pretty lucky to be here + school...don't be silly here and say oh, school sucks...even considering how crappy american schools are, esp cali schools, we're pretty blessed to have a decent education and a chance for our future  and then the small comforts in life...  + THIS KEYBOARD...mmmm feels so good...hahaha + fantasy basketball, if you haven't played it you have no idea what you're missing + music, fo sho...when you feel like crap, it's sometimes the only thing there for you + the internet...oh man, aim alone is worth about 10 paragraphs...screw tv, what would i do without my lovely dsl ;-; + sports, as a type of social gathering, as a way to hone in skills, as a way to just kill time, sometimes as an emotional release...not to mention the thrilling ups and downs of team loyalty (1-13) + books...although i don't read much anymore, not too many things beat the feeling of being engrossed in a wholly different literary world that keeps you up till 3 am reading reading reading...can you say parry hotter? + clothes...stupid as it sounds, oh man it's so cool to wear my rams jersey and t-mac 3's (with no-show socks, no less) + my room...it's got all of MAH SHIT in here, all condensed into a...16x10? foot space...including my color uncoordinated computer  i think i've run out of things to be thankful for. but you get the picture...i mean while it's great to be buying stuff and cooking and watching football during the holidays, sometimes it's good to just sit back and think about what makes these last few weeks of the year so special in the first place. everything from the material gifts, to the more immaterial...from what we want, to what we need...from what we enjoy, to what we truly cherish.

        sindy's birthday   watch out, boring reconstruction of day post coming up. today was pretty fun, i woke up at noon and called alex and he picked up me and kevin to go the movies. we saw willis and hannah (jun's i-can't-believe-she's-not-twin), then natasha, cassandra, and sindy/cindy/gayzel/rexine. no one could make up their mind but we eventually decided on gothika (by way of cat in the hat tickets), then we all went in and ran into james and kevin a (aka ranter kevin). james left, kevin went with us, gothika was kinda scary but the tension was worse than most of the actual scares because the scenes were so PREDICTABLE. gotta have rain, old car, road close, detour, cross a bridge. then the retarded as fuck protagonist must investigate the most dilapidated buildings she can find, and expect to escape unharmed. halle berry is good though. kevin h kept on scaring natasha who jumped up 6 times. cassandra kept on covering her face with her jacket and yelling a lot so me and kevin a kept staring at her.   then we went to texas roadkill and i threw peanuts at jun, esther came, long wait so we went to borders, back to texas roadhouse, me kevin alex stalked natasha and cassandra around the outside but they met back with everyone else and gayzel saw kevin's head sticking up ruining our devious scheme of i don't know. then we went to friday's (what's zach gowen's favorite place to eat? ihop!). we all ate (they forgot about my dish so it came hella late), we finished, the employees came over all excited yelling "i heard it's someone's birthday" but sindy was gone to get cake. then she came back and they sang the birthday song remix: "this is your birthday song, it's not very long, cya." then cake, presents, paid the $186 or so bill for 14 of us, then the girls made this nasty drink with ketchup, salt and pepper, cake, ice cream, celery, steak sauce, water, and tartar sauce. cassandra took a tiny bit and gagged, but alex started gulping it. CRAZY MOTHERFUCKER. we went outside and it was pretty damn cold, everyone got picked up and we went home.

        white flag -- dido    i know you think that i shouldn't still love you i'll tell you that  but if i didn't say it, well i'd still have felt it  where's the sense in that i promise i'm not trying to make your life harder  or return to where we were   but i will go down with this ship and i won't put my hands up and surrender  there will be no white flag above my door  i'm in love and always will be   i know i left too much mess  and destruction to come back again  and i caused nothing but trouble  i understand if you can't talk to me again  and if you live by the rules of "it's over" then i'm sure that that makes sense   but i will go down with this ship and i won't put my hands up and surrender  there will be no white flag above my door  i'm in love and always will be   and when we meet, which i'm sure we will  all that was then will be there still  i'll let it pass and hold my tongue  and you will think that i've moved on  i will go down with this ship and i won't put my hands up and surrender  there will be no white flag above my door  i'm in love and always will be

        more ranting   why must everybody (teenagers especially) jump on the liberalism bandwagon? wow, it's so cool to make fun of arnold schwarzenegger (mrs. weissenborn said cah-lee-FOH-nee-ah for the 100th time! she's funny! hahahaha!!). wow, his dad was a nazi! george bush is stupid! the war sucks, peta is cool! (haha, it's fun to publicly  urlLink degrade clay aiken  just cuz he doesn't like one species out of a couple zillion! because animals are just like people! o man, stop the laughter!) we've probably got 70% of the delegation in the mock convention repping for liberals, and maybe half of the remainder are pretending to be conservative/moderate for balancing's sake. it's just too bad nobody thinks for themselves anymore.  what else...this man is very  urlLink smart . found him off blogger's blogs of note...if you know what he's talking about, you'll get a kick out of it. that reminds me, the bullcrap about cbs being "cowardly" about not filming the ronald reagan travesty of a biopic...(1) the man suffers from alzheimer's. something like this should not be filmed unless he can defend himself. (2) fabricated stories about artificially-created "heroes" (read: jessica lynch and the  urlLink crap the military spread  about her glorious rescue) are one thing, but doing them about men of reagan's stature is just disgraceful and repugnant. despite what people may think about his policies and actions, he was a great president that united the nation during the scares of the cold war.  it's gonna be on showtime now, whoop-dee-fucking-doo. hey, i'm not watching it.

        california democrat ass-clowns   what the hell is their problem with repealing the increase in car tax? it was only to be increased if there were insufficient funds in the treasury to give to local governments for sprending. why was there insufficient funds? gray. davis. energy. crisis. special. interests. but democrats and liberal newspapers *cough*sanjosemercury*cough* act like it's money in the bank. don't be tax-increasing dilatory pussies, cut the goddamn budget already. so much money for prisons? so much pork? so much waste in the education budget (a full 40+% of state expenditures)? CUT THE CRAP.  edit 8:49 pm: oh yea, today i finally had to pay up for losing the bet (rams v. niners couple weeks back) to mr. o, and he really made me pay. man, there goes $19 (i throw away change unless it's quarters, but i hate quarters too). we went to dino's for lunch, we each had a monte cristo sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, ham on toast). good stuff. just up to 6 years ago he worked for frito-lay in west oakland, crazy. he can't teach anything above honors geometry cuz he needs to get a master's in math or something, but he's too lazy to go back to school. (he's like 6 points of 75 away from maxing out his accreditation and salary.) stats/calc with mr.o would be fun though. also, the sophs want to marry his coconuts, but mr. o's gonna make individual classes get 10 perfect scores to attain that prestigious honor. on a different tack, he and mr. cory think that the way to solve government problems is to create a flat tax, 10 cents of every dollar go to federal tax and 5 cents to state, you pocket the rest. get rid of pork and our country would be humming. and mr. cory knows a tiny bit about football! he rules.  edit 9:14 pm: thanks to the advice of one of emmalyn's sophisticated  urlLink collegiate connections , my bike has been newly cleansed with the glory of wd-40.

        isn't it so obvious?   michelle branch's "xanga" is just copy-pasted from her  urlLink message board . stupid me. but it is all genuine at least, which is pretty sweet. and her favorite song off hotel paper is empty handed...oh you know it.  i got new socks, new ram for my stupid computer, cleaned out the fan so you can't hear my computer running from roughly a block away anymore, did some situps, and actually got some homework done. feel the power of being productive!  precal: 4.4, trig ratios...yawn...yay for my calc book (3.7? max and min values for functions) eng: the legend of sleepy hollow. inanely verbose, with the biggest letdown of an ending EVAR. was irving high when he wrote this? history: ch. 13, stuff about westward expansion. we learned this three years ago...evil americans, sending away the godly native americans... chem: ch. 14, kinetics. a chance to bust out my calc skillz! (or lack thereof) woot. mandarin: V-3, about the kid falling asleep in class and his nose gets drawn on. if it was interesting and made the tiniest bit of sense maybe i'd like it. art: landscape drawings w/colored pencils. why can't we just skip the pish-posh and go to drawing people already...

        welcome back   heather's party was really cool. she got HELLA presents, oh my goose...and she has this tiny alcove above her dining room that magically makes people claustrophobic to the point of no return. i never knew she liked wrestling and videogames that much, you can't tell just from talking to her. but happy sweet 16 if you're reading this :-D  i don't know if they read this, but you know who you are...it's ON.

        random thoughts III   + master and commander is a pretty good movie. slow in the middle, but it picks up after the (really cool) naturalist guy gets shot. he did his own surgery! that guy rules. + i spent WAY too much time yesterday working on those stupid fantasy stats. felt good to finish though. + i owe emmalyn that story, i should start working on it huh...we had some strange ideas, haha. + man, my cousin beat me twice in street with duncan, iverson and yao?! i suck. + the magic are 1-9. WTF. + got to go to heather's birthday party today. eugene...haha...i hope you don't talk to all girls like that. + coach's assumption that we can't do duties: look at how many tasks he gives to the captains. survey, ranking, training, one-on-one meetings... + my cousin got me thinking, reloaded might've been better than revolutions. 100-smith fight, fight in the atrium (haha the janitor v. that cleaning lady), car chase...what did revolutions have? even more talking... + i think you need to move it to the left shorty! move it to the left shorty!  edit 1:39 pm: michelle branch has a  urlLink xanga ? if you read enough posts, it does seem authentic, she says a lot of things that an impersonator probably wouldn't be able to make up. if it really is her, two things: (1) that's pretty damn cool, and (2) wouldn't it be neat if celebrities had decent grammar?

        i want my money back!   heh...matrix revolutions sucked. not even in comparison to the original matrix, it just sucked. those silly wachowski brothers should've stopped when they were ahead; both of these sequels were just as unnecessary as the star wars prequels. they suffer from the same convoluted plot lines (weird machine war and architect v. trade councils), uninspired love stories (neo and trinity, and did anyone give a shit about link and zee? v. anakin and amidala), annoying as FUCK characters (jar ja...aaahh...it hurts to type his name v. that stupid 16-year-old "NEO SAVED US! WE WON THE WAR! I'M A JACKASS!"), and overall crappy acting. since when is "you did it." "no, we did it" and neo and trinity's "let's see how far we can go through the movie without showing one recognizable human emotion" revolutionary filmmaking? in addition, the entire machine v. man battle was a waste because it took away from the meat and bones of the matrix, which was being in the matrix. duh. and they even ruined that with the flood of special effects that made the final "big battle" seem like some sort of giant videogame fight. o yea, where was the payoff in the movie? when *insert random major character here* died? or the ending? which still had no actual explanation/conclusion and included no characters from the FIRST movie. maybe i expected too much, but matrix revolutions was a total disappointment.  and oh yea, our yahoo badminton group is so dumb. our captains are fine, but i resent the coach's assumption that they're the only ones capable of doing team duties. and alex and jennie lee evaluating the jv team? right.

        a nightmare you can't wake up from   i mean, really, even erik bothered to talk to me today. sometimes people either don't know or don't care how about much they can affect somebody else.  anyway, you know you're a badminton player if you come out of open gym with your weak hand pale as snow and your playing hand like a frickin apple. and blisters on your foot!! AGH that stuff sucks. but showers after exercising the crap out of yourself feel so good.  three things you need: the BEAUTIFUL  urlLink google deskbar , which murders the google toolbar (except it doesn't have pop-up killing), and some of these cool windows xp professional  urlLink powertoys . alt-tab replacement, tweak ui (tweak your computer), and power calculator are pretty damn helpful. also, you can kill spyware with lavasoft's free  urlLink ad-aware  program.  nobody really wants to know this but i'm just gonna compare what i like about this year and last year for my own personal benefit. and if you don't wanna see...too bad, this is my blog!! i like quantifying things. hahahahkakaka...yup...   sophomore year  talked to more people more involved in school/class stuff classes were easy as crap (geometry) and had fun people (chem!) talking about weekend in mr o's class (wait, no, somebody in our class ruined it) and block walks cool teachers (mr. o, lott sometimes, losson) no history notes! sdfkljdklsfj   junior year  more fit and athletic (BADMINTON) better at mandarin more time to myself (aka talking to less people) challenging classes (chem, mandarin 3 kinda, calculus) getting ok at drawing following nfl and nba more  but almost nothing beats hanging out with your best friends...even if you don't really do anything fun.

FUCK. if anybody comes with us, i will love you forever. well, nobody really wants that, so how about i'll just give you money. that works too.   who wants you now, maybe somebody else i'll wait around, maybe you'll forget you were ever here maybe forget you were ever, never here  i'm on the outside looking down, what do i see so much of this cold in the ground, where would i be out on the outside looking down, cover me before you go  it's in your mind, it's in your eyes so it's goodbye again it's way past time for one last try so it's goodbye again

'07 won community service...'04 got 3rd place in skit and decorations (i think), which is pretty sad, but hey there's always next year...wait, too bad you don't have next year!! hahahahaha...jp...yeaa...

        happy halloween   before anything else, monday, lunchtime basketball regardless of club meetings or weather. i will play by myself if i have to. so be there if you can (that means you too ladies). see if we can get it off the ground again. oh yea, monkey bars at nighttime are pretty frickin scary. trust me.  now here's where i write about all the stuff i didn't bother to mention almost two hours ago. uhhh the carnival at ardenwood was fun, not as many people, not 1/100th as much candy as last year, but we enjoyed ourselves and put smiles on little greedy candy-snatching brats' faces and dunked on ankur's mini hoop thing and laughed at funny pictures pat took on his digital camera and alley-ooped glow sticks. american girls tennis lost v. logan, but they're still 4th in league which is really good. mvals baby! that reminds me, i have a newfound respect for mr. brown after his daring performance at the crappy unity rally today and his bothering to come watch the tennis game. just like lott: crappy teacher, not a bad person.  unity rally! i omitted it from the previous post because i didn't remember it, because it sucked. even worse than the senior rally, and that's saying something...haha just joshing you seniors. or am i? but yea, it was even longer and lamer. homecoming court entrances weren't bad (gary! gary!). congrats to gary and aurora, i was expecting him and krizelda but hey. the whole excuse for an excuse for a rap sequence killed the last vestiges of intelligence i retained after seeing alex carabello waste another day's worth of oxygen. the guy could beatbox alright though. step dance was better than yesterday, to the shock and awe of jenn liu and ira sitting next to me. aurora's dress was too long and she had to sit lol, krizelda just forgot everything. the first-year teacher game was funny in a pointless, retarded way, with tommy weems screaming "mrs. kostamo!!" roughly 6.02 x 10^23 times. band was good, it took basho like 5 minutes to realize "oh that's thriller huh!" ankur, you know what to do.

        phones   i think with this appalling amount of free time allotted to us by the unfortunate circumstance of two major holidays falling within a week of each other, i will employ my seldom-used soapbox to sound off on my disconcerting lack of appetite for verbal communication by means of the telephone. why do i, unlike so many of my fellow high schoolers, bear a pronounced disregard for usage of this medium to socialize with those i consider my friends? (why can't i use normal english? beats me.)   why don't i call people?  this interesting deviation of mine was brought to light recently when emma asked me to call her during her snowboarding trip. of course i said i'd try but...when it got to it, all the days passed and i never really found a convincing reason to pick up the phone and just press fogoggy. those seven numbers -- hell, any seven numbers -- get very hard for me to push. basically, out of every person i've ever called, only once can i recall having done it just for the hell of it. otherwise i've always had some purpose, whether it be an RSVP or asking where to go for a party. but calling just to say hey? what the hell is that...that's what aim is for.  so then i wondered, how many people think like me? i've got to be in some sizeable minority of anti-social, practical people who save social mores for actually meeting face to face, right? but from the conversations i've had, from the xangas/blogs i've read, i'm pretty damn wrong. and by considering what i believed to be arguments against it, i've figured out some fairly convincing reasons to support the practice of occasional phone calls. to keep in touch, silly billy.  if it's so simple, one might ask, why don't i do it?   yet for me, it's not really simple. i don't understand why, but all of my life i have been considering the feelings and circumstances of the other party almost as deeply as those of my own. so before entering those seven digits, i wonder...what if so-and-so is busy? what if so-and-so has someone else they want to call, but my calling will force them to politely postpone their desired conversation until later? what if so-and-so's running out of minutes? what if so-and-so has nothing to talk about with me? crap like that. it's just how 16.5 years of being a low priority in other's lives will condition you to think.   so, after this half an hour of written diatribe, i've concluded that my avoidance of telephonic discourse is not due to any sort of economic disadvantage, personality quirk, or lack of willing receivers -- it's a full-on psychological disorder. whee.

        return of the king   watched return of the king today. spoilers, yadda yadda. i really don't know what to think about it, now that lotr the movie is finally over. my expectations were really high considering the boundless praise it received, and it did deliver. by the time pippin was singing to denethor while faramir led the doomed charge on osgiliath, you just knew you were witnessing something special. rotk had a lot of ground to cover, and it did so well -- gollum's cunning psychological warfare, the grand battles, the epic scenery...rohan coming to gondor...the scale of this movie was just huge. but the ending (aka fifty million fades to black followed by more blandness to appease the book fanatics) just didn't rub on me too well. a recuperated frodo (whose medicine apparently included heaping amounts of heroin) and gandalf laughing like they had a bit too much of the happy plant was rather strange, and the ensuing big reunion was rendered meaningless when we saw them all again at aragorn's coronation as king. the parts with sam were a waste, and they spent way too much time saying bye before the departure into the west. but enough of me, rotk will get a best picture oscar and deservedly so.

        old poem   christmas draws ever closer. whee.   as i sit down next to you two feet away i feel as if we are closer than before and yet we have never been farther apart  as i sit down next to you the two feet feel like two years and though we've known each other forever we don't know each other at all 	 as i sit down next to you the two feet feel like two miles and though we know we can't go on we still let ourselves keep pretending  as i sit down next to you the two feet are the closest we dare get for every inch closer we move brings us miles closer to the truth and the truth is we have nothing  as i sit down next to you the two feet is the distance between us and we can't allow it to grow even if we tried we want to move, but we stay, for we don't want to hurt each other but sitting there, two feet away we are just hurting ourselves  as i sit down next to you the two feet become nothing and though we know there was something that something wasn't enough and together, we see that we were living a lie that we cannot be  as i sit down next to you and as we hold back our tears and as we finally understand the two feet disappear

        christmas   might as well add this while i still feel like crap. i am not giving christmas gifts this year. i am broke, i don't know what to get anybody, there are too many deserving people to give gifts to. i'm sorry if anyone was expecting something, but, i don't want to buy something for someone to help them attain some distorted version of happiness, and i don't want anybody to do that for me. i hope everybody realizes that money can't buy joy...please don't think that by giving people that jersey or cd or warehouse-sized bag of chocolate yams that you're making their christmas. just make sure to remember them. money cannot buy friends...only time can.

        stupidly aggravating test   i don't feel like posting, except it's annoying me to see that last entry sitting there with no explanation, no justification. oh well, you're not going to get one. sorry. now as i emulate many other blogs that have no sensible transitions between their inexplicable shifts in topic, i feel the now playing section is kinda useless because i can't type anything resembling a coherent post while music is playing. i can always try though.  on to today. woke up early for the sat...it was raining which was pretty cool. my dad's friend kk (like...krispy kreme!) picked me up and dropped me off at logan around 7:40, where i waited and started to vegetate until belinda, sarah y, and later amanda came to save me from having to talk to myself. cool dudettes. i would try to remember something we said in a vain attempt to make you laugh or remotely amuse you, but the other xangas do that for me. the only people that actually bother to read through those long-winded recapitulations of events of the day are the people that were involved, and then what's the point of reading it when you just did it like three hours ago? but i digress.   i had ignorantly glossed over the signs telling students of certain last names which gateway to hell to enter, so i raced over to my room and hastily crammed in a few final sat words as a last hurrah of freedom (trust me, throw the lists away, IT DOES NOT HELP). then after many ridiculous delays caused by the usual shoddy organization of anything remotely related to the college board, the long-winded, boring-to-the-point-of-self-mutilation sat commenced. i guess i did alright, although no conceivable practice environment can compare to the true testing experience (even being plunged headfirst into the amazon river with man-eating monkey piranhas of doom menacingly chomping away at your nasal cavity...ok...maybe that one would suffice). no matter how much you think otherwise, the sat is the frickin big life-or-death, college-or-parents-hate-you-and-your-grandchildren-forever sat; you will stare at even the most rudimentary of questions for hours wondering if 4 x 2 really is 8 as some outcast societies like to claim. yes, most of the sat is easier than the psat, but the sat can have some funkily anal reading comprehension questions.   that's about it for anything noteworthy today, except for some fantasy basketball roster reorganizing. i LOVE fantasy basketball. and nba street. except for my occasional eternal hatred for the blatant cheating of the computer (even on medium, geez, let arenas dunk for once). and my periodic bush-basher bashing: so the turkey was fake, get over it. he flew to iraq for crying out loud. idiots. i could say more but baseless arguments from my inane little brother are enough for me.  note: no, i do not come up with all these florid sentences the first time through; halfway through my posts i will feel inspired and write something highly pedantic and wordy and a total chore to read, and then i'll decide to make every sentence equally tedious, so i edit scraps here and there with the fierce resolve of rich gannon during a preseason game. just fyi.

        ren zhi chuuuuu   today was COOL. yes, you read right. ryan, enjoying a day of school? but today was quite the exception to the rule. precal, watched remember the titans, GOOD MOVIE and it doesn't do the trademark "disney whitewash" of the undesirable aspects of the story. then focus, i learned newton's method, easy. history, we saw shenandoah (sp), it was the first truly enjoyable old movie i've seen besides the bond flicks. who knew movies in the 60's had humor? nhs meeting, we all HAVE to get basketball jerseys for christmas and wear them when we go back to school, that would be awesome. then in mandarin SO COOL, i'm editor-in-chief for our something something re bao (hot banana newspaper) so i get to direct our class through the process, i can't explain but it's really cool to take charge of something i enjoy. we also recited the san zi jing for extra credit, a few people were trying to do it as fast as possible to get extra extra credit, so instead i performed san zi jing: the jim carrey version and hammed it up quite shamelessly. it was good to let loose after being always so wound up and reserved.

        wahoo   ehh, what's there to say. mr. brady's pretty funny...of all the schools in cali taking the CAML test, we're #3 in alphabetical order. me and rajan presented ch. 4-7 for huck finn in english, screw teaching -- it's HARD to keep the class interested. and no one leapfrogged on my little cerebrally intensive prompts. rajan sprung on them a pop quiz, then we discussed and did pictionary. gina vs. whitney, gina drew the least hairbally hairball evar. and ankur vs. tina, let me say if ankur can draw better than you, you are artistically challenged :-D (oh yeah, everyone pitch in for ankur's $300 mp3 player, considering my readership you'll only have to pay $100 each. haha.) we actually learned something in chem, go figure. now if only that happened more often than, say, once a month. gloria's gonna ditch me at winter ball ;-; you guys better all go, or else i'm gonna sic Cone-Freaking Emma (tm) and Covert-Freaking James (tm) on y'all. be very scared.   edit 11:13 PM: actually, if i had Cone-Freaking Emma (tm) bearing down on me, i wouldn't mind :-D haha...

        are you ready for some football?    lots of you guys don't really care about tomorrow's super bowl, but there's still enough truckloads of  urlLink hoopla  surrounding the big game to load on a lot of trucks. myself, i like having the extra week to allow the tension permeating throughout the lone star state to rise to that big splashing crescendo we call cbs's frito-lay recap of the pre-pre-pregame show, brought to you by the cheese packets from pizza hut.   advertisers pay $2.3 million for 30-second  urlLink super bowl ads . haven't they ever realized maybe people watch the commercials for the sake of watching, and they generally won't be motivated any more than by a $10,000 freeway billboard with a clashing color scheme to go purchase their merchandise? i don't think beyonce, pink and britney spears in unflattering xena outfits would convince me to drink pepsi regularly again.   urlLink you mean there's a game too?  right. like everyone else that knows quarterback isn't the name of a  urlLink canadian rock band , i think new england wins with its experience, stifling secondary, range of passing options (carolina doesn't have a third threat like daniel graham), and a highly poised tom brady. carolina's strength lies in its furious front four on defense, but since new england doesn't rely heavily on their running game (their 14-game winning streak consists of  urlLink zero  100-yard rushing contributions), that won't matter so much. but if carolina wins, it's because of that crazy mofo steve smith (who put the nail in the proverbial coffin for the rams' super bowl hopes three weeks ago) and the teller to his penn, muhsin mohammad.  extra, extra...nfl threatens to  urlLink sue casinos in las vegas  for holding super bowl parties on televisions bigger than *gasp* 55 inches, and daring to *double gasp* charge customers to come! "NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league only recently became aware of large parties planned in Las Vegas and elsewhere around the country." BULLSHIT,  urlLink they've known for years  or else they're absolutely blind and brainless, they just want to be the only entity raking in the dough for sunday. "As far as I'm concerned, the NFL is full of soup," Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said. "I would tell them to go shove it."

         urlLink the perfect score     was absolute trash. it was like mtv deliberately tried to make a shitty b-movie, and they even failed to accomplish that. no one could act, the contrived ending inundated with thinly veiled righteous preaching about the virtues of making your own life rendered the entire cesspool of a plot worthless, the lame send-offs of the matrix/italian job/ocean's eleven/mission: impossible weren't deserving of the letters i'm compiling together to write about them, and its highly touted subversive "cleverness" in pointing out standardized testing's "failures" and "discriminations" caused me to like the  urlLink sat  more. save lawrence nam as the stereotypical anti-establishment dorky horny asian stoner (isn't it ironic how the movie that claims the sat perpetuates existing teenage stereotypes consists of walking stereotypes as its main characters?), this movie was utterly devoid of anything worth the lint out of my pants pockets.

        i am NOT studying     what is there to study for? like sats, finals should be a gauge of where you are in terms of the curriculum, testing how you can apply what you've learned in unique situations. NOT to see how much crap you've memorized about the 15 bazillion tariffs in revolutionary-era america. that's why the socratic seminar in english appeals to me, except when we use stupid books like  farewell to arms  and idiots like vanessa talk over everybody and impress us with how much of sparknotes they can memorize. and that's exactly why the genre project and history poster are big steaming stinking piles of dog crap. for the genre project, the collective prettiness of the poster, timeline and multimedia supplement is given just about as much weight as the genres themselves. WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT. i would hope that in an ENGLISH class, creativity, insight and depth in writing would be a bit more important than adding sparkles to a fucking posterboard.   oh, the history poster. sorry people who presented today, but today showcased just why our history class is completely worthless. the first poster's analogy towards the gilded age was thoroughly uninspired and unconvincing, and the so-called similarities were strung together with sewing thread. the second poster looked stylish, but was CRAP. this isn't art class, dammit. the poster had twenty billion pictures that had nothing to do with history, and the explanations didn't even ATTEMPT to link to anything remotely relating to the analogy. maybe because they had no ideas in the first place? half of the presenters read their explanations straight off of paper (if you're not gonna bother memorizing your twnety seconds of speech, just read from the damn book and save us the pretense). another presenter tried really hard to recall specific details but ended up listing blatantly obvious generalities of the time period (interjected with "umm"s every five seconds) for two minutes too long. then of course, we realize that since every group must compare EVERYTHING about the gilded age to their analogy instead of just a certain sector, every group will be repeating the EXACT same things, but of course weissenborn doesn't really care about originality now does she?

        finals draw ever closer     i figure i should post again after a rather uneventful weekend for moi. what is there to say? i feel absolutely no pressure for my finals, which is either good news or a sign that all the ritalin i've been taking is finally working. this would look the perfect jumpoff point for a long rambunctious tirade about the fallacy of high-stakes testing and the detrimental effects of such a constant emphasis on it as a judgment of scholastic progress (this idea of course being the cornerstone of president bush's  urlLink much-maligned  " urlLink no child left behind " act). but that topic is quite self-explanatory already. i could also use this opportunity to bitch about how the status quo pathway through college -- filling out your transcript with a menagerie of meaningless club activities, sports and high academics; dutifully and joblessly graduating from college in 3 years; and wasting an additional 2+ years for that master's, law degree or medical certification that literally thousands of other potential job-seekers are attaining at the same time -- does NOT adequately prepare anybody for the real world. however, that also explains itself right there. just don't say i didn't warn you.  random bric-a-brac: [+] eating mcdonald's for  urlLink 30 days straight  can be bad for you. no kidding. [+] longtime washington redskins coach norv turner = new temporary solution to  urlLink raiders woes . [+] the upcoming  urlLink super bowl  = nothing more than a nice analgesic for the assortment of splitting migraines, sore muscles, and mental aches and sprains that we like to call school[+] barbara walters says goodbye (to  urlLink 20-20 ), but regis philbin makes a more than adequate replacement (to  urlLink who wants to be a millionaire ). as long as they don't run the show roughly 300 million times a week again. [+] " urlLink 34% of college freshmen  surveyed last fall say it's important to keep up with politics, continuing a three-year uptick that began just months after the Florida recount and weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks." it took 3 FRICKIN YEARS for that number to reach 34%? c'mon, during 1966 the percentage was 60%, although maybe we have the sexy vietnam war to blame/credit for that. i hate my generation. [+] hmm, arnold will try to convince 10% of UC-eligible students to switch tracks to community colleges next school year. in addition, future education spending increases (NOT the budget itself, mind you) will be slashed by $2 billion a year, spending for csu's and uc's will actually decrease (0.3% and 2.4%, respectively), and undergraduate fees will increase 10% (graduate fees a whopping 40%). before you castrate gov. schwarzenegger, however, first remember that (1) the  urlLink projected overall education budget  is still $46.7 billion, and (2) it's not his fault that californians spend  urlLink 3% of their income  on education (40th in the country).  [+] i always enjoy seeing people show off talents that you never knew about (like seeing a friend suddenly bust out crazy basketball skills out of nowhere), or talk intelligently and competently about a given subject (sports, politics, music, regulation snowman head sizes, whatever).

        more celeb gossip   bennifer  urlLink is no more . i don't know whether to laugh or laugh harder.  OH YEAH...happy  urlLink chinese new year  everybody. gong xi fa cai (no cantonese from me, puah).   somebody shake me cuz i i must be sleeping     edit 10:42 PM: i guess i should explain what happened during my multi-genre project presentation (red pollard, seabiscuit's jockey). it went all right, i showed a clip of seabiscuit -- a race at the santa anita handicap -- and everyone wanted to watch more. i neatly segued between my genres (a lame fan letter and a somewhat amusing poem that allowed me to do bust out my wannabe ghetto gesticulations again) and a few tidbits about depression-era america and horse racing in general. then i did my skit. UTTER CRAP. what was i smoking when i thought it up? it only superficially touched on seabiscuit (and only then it was the movie), and i found myself talking about guys' pectoral muscles, and then singing a shirley temple song, and then jump-kicking myself. WHY DID I DO IT. pah.   i remember being so excited about it last night and practicing the choreography of the fight for about half an hour so i wouldn't slip. then when i actually got to it during my presentation, i realized how retarded it was. but considering i already spent so much time prepping for it, i thought i might as well see it through. but then mr. brown calls me over and tells me (in an excessively gruff voice in retrospect) that my song might've offended nadine (who did shirley temple, which inspired idiotic me to do the song since shirley temple once did a seabiscuit movie). one of the worst sensations ever. i suddenly didn't want to talk, i didn't have the energy to keep my head off my desk, i didn't want to think because i might dwell over why i did it, i just wanted to go home and sleep. hence, i was half-awake during the entireity of focus. i was better after that, but then i walk into chem and hosniya asks me to reenact the song, ergo i relive the incident again. DAMN THE WORLD.

        happy chinese new year's eve     today was somewhat fun, we had a party in mandarin class with hot woks and egg rolls and half-assed spur-of-the-moment amalgations of sentences that we dared to call skits. haha, i was in that lion garb moving in random directions while eugene and vicky bashed their instruments at random intervals. damn i felt so unasian, just listening to the freshmen complain about me holding chopsticks wrong and not knowing what to call such-and-such delicacy and busting out their smooth mah-jong skillz. overall not too bad, although eugene never got to burn the incense sticks and set off the fire alarm. i felt weird carrying my wok back home though.  edit 8:34 PM:  urlLink meet the fockers . haha...oh yeah, it's now the  urlLink brooklyn nets . crazy.

[+] poor  urlLink eagles , i know that one hurt, stupid late hit on donovan mcnabb.

        happy new year   2003 passed rather uneventfully for me, as i was chatting morosely with a few friends unfortunate enough to be stuck with yours truly instead of actually doing something interesting. i even missed the countdown because the tv's all the way in the living room, though i'm not really griping about it. but nevertheless, quite the contrast from last year's new year's festivities eh...there goes winter break.  anyway, here's to hoping 2004 doesn't suck as much as last year did.  edit 1:09 pm: it's funny how cheerful you can be when you wake up, and how quickly it can end up in the gutter after being reminded of everything.

         let me introduce you  to the time where it all ended all of the bitterness, the suffering the sanctimonious lies, the saccharine affection i'm tired of it all  the artificiality, the banality the trepidation and feigned adulation the self-impressed and those obsessed with nothing more than the evanescent  the backstabbing and double-talking can't you see this road we're walking leads us back to square one back to you and me, us and nothing more it's all we want and it's all we're running away from  because you're just like the million others before you throwing salt over your shoulder hopping over the cracks too scared to walk under that ladder just once too scared to taste that apple too scared to live  i'm sick of just existing somebody, please wake me to someplace where i can breathe, please take me where i can leave you behind to walk this world, free and unshackled delivered from you and all that you put me through  shrug me off, you played me like a game but at the end of it all you will know my name you think that this poem is nothing but words time will give you everything you deserve

        i feel like bitching   i hate bookstores. especially borders. i've checked TWO branches of the biggest bookstore in the country three and two times respectively over the last two weeks, both which have computers telling me they have that waste of processed rotted tree bark entitled  beloved  in stock in the "african american history" section. when i eventually bother to peruse the black history section after first cussing out some asinine asian woman for complaining she was charged 8.28% tax instead of 8.25% on a 29 cent candy cane, the area unsurprisingly manifests itself as a completely random amalgation of books with random racist epithets as titles, which might as well have been chucked into a tornado and then thrown into a vat of bubbling lava, cooled, shredded like that retarded answer sheet in the perfect score, taped together by homosexual crack-smoking monkeys, and indiscriminately shot out of a yugo's exhaust pipe into the bookcase for all the sense the employees put into ordering the shelves. then of course, wonderful barnes and noble has half a row dedicated to my best friend toni morrison, only to emit an absolutely devilish laugh with NO DETECTABLE SENSE OF REMORSE -- as if it was delivered by el diablo himself -- because NONE OF THE BOOKS are  beloved.   then, to make matters worse, we have my supposed savior in badminton. I HATE BADMINTON. no i don't, i hate our team. not everybody, just the people that don't give a crap. we had 69 -- count 'em, s-i-x-t-y-n-i-n-e -- players today at our first "practice." where the fuck were you in october, you lazy cunts? all of a sudden they decide they want to flood the team and take up very precious space in our cabbage patch kid-sized gym with their utter void of passion for the sport? when they think badminton is the wussy girly spring sport and the easy way to get a varsity block? when they think all you have to do is stand around and hit a stupid cock -- oh, haha! he said cock! -- a few times to win? then of course, with all of this repressed anger i feel towards the idiots taking up our team's oxygen, at least i can look to the coach for reassurance and support, right? because our coach won't segregate the team into different skill levels without having even watching half the team play yet, right? because our coach won't favor the players he knows over the players that have actual skill, right? because our coach will actually get our team into shape and teach us fundamental techniques and demanding practice regimens during every practice, right? who the hell am i kidding. what the hell did i do to deserve this bullshit, did i kill the 73rd reincarnation of the dalai lama while finishing my weekly ant extermination in the front lawn? the world is a gaping vacuum of absolute sucktitude.

            urlLink houston, we have a champion    after 27 minutes of lame scorelessnessosity punctuated by the sporadic waste of advertising air-space, we finally got a football game going. jake delhomme and tom brady traded off crazy throw after crazy throw, pole-vaulting steve smith and muhsin muhammad were indeed crazy mofos, and the underdog panthers finally got me rooting for them. and new england's two-point conversion was just so AWESOME. i'm sure it's been done before, but the misdirection of the snap to kevin faulk and tom brady's oscar-worthy deceptive squeal of agony garnered mountains of  urlLink kudos  in my book. just like two years ago, ricky proehl ties the super bowl for the losing team with a touchdown, and just like two years ago, adam vinatieri seals their demise. definitely one of the best super bowls in a while.  you mean there were commercials too? oh, that's right...they sucked. not to mention the halftime show that will forever linger in infamy as the pinnacle of all overhyped, overproduced, talentless cesspools of mainstream crap. for crying out loud, half of the acts lip-synced. THAT'S PATHETIC. hence, the nfl will never allow another mtv-produced halftime, and i say  urlLink good riddance , considering that the show was upstaged by the nfl players singing tomorrow. then there was that ridiculous bit with the  urlLink guy disguised as a referee  stripping on the middle of the field and doing some texas two-step deal. greg gumbel: "i think we've had an omen that the second half will be filled with lots of raw, naked football."  then i caught some  urlLink survivor: all-stars . memories of the first survivor! where's colleen! rejoicing in the dehydration of random bitchy rich people! lots of raw, naked richard! woo!

        the liberal bias in the media is true. not exactly cause for celebration or even some riveting writing, but i feel like mentioning it anyway. if you ever read any newspaper or internet news website (except for  urlLink the onion , which is teh r0x0rz), they always feature some sort of democratic complaint over the most ass-retarded events that wouldn't be given space in classifieds if it were republicans bitching at clinton. top story: bush made fun of  urlLink not finding weapons of mass destruction  in iraq! horrors! top story: bush made a  urlLink tv ad  with clips of 9/11 with actors as firefighters! wait, they  were  real firefighters! and knowing how the media is, every person with relatives harmed in the incident was absolutely appalled by the ads and were quoted as saying so. aww shit, wait, some stupid clusterfuck supported it: "It speaks to the truth of the times. Sept. 11 ... was something beyond the realm of imagination, and George Bush ... led us through one of the darkest moments in history." but obviously, something as rational as support for the president (that probably equalled or exceeded the dissension) isn't catchy enough for an article title.  now, let's move on to our godawful history book. it's even lacking in terms of actually covering history. there are so many facets and battles and personalities that LAST YEAR's book (1/2 the size) had more information about. hmm, even though world war ii was the 2nd most devastating event in our history, let's give it one chapter and let's give depression-era america three! then, we have the authors' sanctimonious preaching. in the preface they blather on about how wonderful the book is and how they've incorporated criticisms to improve such and such. they added "the ambiguous impact of industrialization on the independence of single women." two problems. (1): you're devoting page space in a concrete "history book" to something ambiguous? what the fuck, mates, so basically we're memorizing hypotheticals and your philosophical bitchings. (2) did you ever ask those single women what was the ambiguous impact of industrialization on their independence? what i see is, they found two illegible "primary sources" from women of the time, and then they turned around and made it a blanket description of the ENTIRE FUCKING CATEGORY. how else do you get this BULLshit about how latinos (exactly what percentage? hmm sorry we forgot...) felt like true americans because they served in world war ii? the book ignores the country's near-affair with fdr, instead taking every new column in chapter 28 to mention how photogenic eisenhower's smile was. they bitch about how we get tangled in too many affairs in latin america, but when we lose china to the communists it's OUR fault for not being more involved. they blow up 20,000 in the naacp to encompass every person in the world with tan skin, they blow up a curiosity in communism into "all americans were strongly tempted by the wonders of the reds!" every chapter, women and blacks find new resolve to gain independence...in that case they must've taken over the world by now. then the authors have the nerve to complain that the media and new houses and electric dishwashers magically instill conformity, when kids in colleges and high schools across the country are all reading the SAME GODDAMN SELF-RIGHTEOUS BOOK. SHUT UP.   oh yeah, i have to finish off with the great change of pace in english we call  urlLink mama day . at least it beats either another meandering 19th century adventure into parts unknown or cultural novel written by someone of color espousing the splendiferous uniqueness of their race. but then i take offense to gloria naylor's pretentious belief that she can write like both a man or a woman...hell, she actually thinks she writes like a real person. blah blah blah, i'm a man that comes off as nearly autistic (see, i use slide rules to measure out your closet space, just like every person in the world with external reproductive organs) and i think football is so manly because of all this intangibles and engineering crap. blah blah blah, i'm a woman and i'm so womanly because i'm loud and caustic on the outside but deep down i'm soft and vulnerable and only want you to love me for who i REALLY AM, and that's a loud and caustic bitch. therefore let's bite off hemingway and make our conversations as inane and robotic-sounding as possible! "it's just that you're a little confused. and i'm really flattered that i mean enough to you to be part of that confusion." SHUT UP.

       no new deep revelations explored this week, kiddies. so for the sake of staying updated, my topic today shall be our school's international week. but because i don't want to talk about it until next paragraph (makes for an awkward transition) and this paragraph's too short so far, i shall fill 'er up with some blah about human nature and sibling rivalry. (cue awkward transition!) i don't know about you, but i fight (verbally, duh, my dad would clip my third left toenail if i threw punches) a lot with my brother. why? it's all ass-backwards and counterproductive. we talk at dinnertime and he'll think he's being clever by saying something to the tone of "what did you expect from ryan?" then of course i have to say something back because i can't give him the quasi-orgasmic pleasure of having the last word, no matter how much it resembles the speech patterns of a retarded boil-infested hemorrhoidal monkey. but why do i have to respond to him? it just makes both sides angrier if we continue arguing (and if you can tell, it's not one of those nigh nonexistent "intelligent" or even "not completely incomprehensible" debates), and on top of that, my outlandish motive -- to convince him of the error of his anal-retentive "speak louder and longer" methodology -- will NEVER work, because brothers are members of an alien species that cannot exhibit weakness by acknowledging when someone else is right, correct, or allowed to breathe.  now, on to international week. wasn't it just a wonderful spectacle as american high school fully embraced the interaction of a veritable disorganized potpourri of cultures and ethnicities, highlighting the accomplishments and intriguing fashion eccentricities of people from foreign lands, enlightening the student body on the progress the world has made in terms of international brotherhood, and turning our frowns upside down? aww shit, i overdosed on my prescribed hallucinogens again didn't i. let's see what really happened...my wonderful club, the junior statesman of america, had its country chosen for itself by one officer (namely keshav). to make matters worse, he gave us CANADA. WHAT. besides its french roots and those perpetually wedgied mounties, they have relatively NO cultural flavor whatsoever. oooh, we have waffles and pancakes, hockey and beer, which is wonderful because nobody in the united states has ever had those before!  let's go over how the week really went. monday, we had the obligatory informational posters which nobody ever reads thank you very much. tuesday...my club sold 12 day old STORE-BOUGHT waffles. why in the blue stinking craphole did we choose canada again? that's why we have what they call on the street "cultural" clubs, where they actually show pride in their ethnicity. that's also why we have what they call on the street "countries other than canada." wednesday was a small primer for today's food selling and yesterday's fashion show, i suppose. there were a few cultural dances...jca busted out with their ddr dance, which was a good effort but honestly needed to have more flair and limbs flying around concussing random people. i refuse to mention the word astronomy ever again. yesterday was the fashion show; there were some pretty cool clothes, and i refuse to mention the word astronomy ever again. today, they sold food...in other words, people brought store-bought imitations of foreign foods, cut them into infinitesimally small portions and sold them at double the price. csf and italy was easily the most popular with pizza and lasagna, but it would have been more worthwhile if they brought something more exotic like risotto, polenta, whatever. (no i'm not smart, i found those names from  urlLink here .)  [[happy belated birthday jen chien]]

        i'm sure many of you give diddlysquat about politics at any level (from our mayor gus morrison all the way up to the president ... well ... every bay area baby's first words are "bush sucks" so that doesn't mean anything to me), and if anyone dared to mention international politics to your face you'd probably fart at them. so beware, for i am about to bust out my highly specious knowledge of ...  urlLink TAIWANESE POLITICS . you'd better bring out the world's largest whoopee cushion for that baby.  basically, taiwan has two major parties, the democratic progressive party (which favors independence from communist china, which is very good) and the kuomintang, or nationalist party (which favors reunification with the mainland, which is very bad). this morning they held presidential elections between the incumbents from the dpp, chen shui-bian and vice president annette lu, versus the kmt's silver spoon candidate lien chan. chen won by the smallest margin in national history -- 29,000 votes, or .2% of 12.9 million cast (80% turnout folks). however, almost 340,000 votes had been rendered invalid, causing lien to ... wait for it ... go skinny-dipping in the taiwan strait. no, he refused to concede defeat and demanded a recount. just to piss him off, the taiwanese high court sealed off ballot boxes as evidence, and a recount could take weeks. to punctuate the turmoil, large riots by both sides have destroyed buildings and tickle-me-elmo dolls across the island. in addition, chen's proposed referendum for taiwan to defend itself from the 50+ missiles china is aiming at the small nation was boycotted by 55% of voters, dooming it to invalidity.  now, here's where it gets interesting. yesterday, chen was shot by an unidentified gunman while parading in the highly nationalistic southern city of tainan -- a bullet grazed vp lu's ankle and went through his stomach. a delayed chinese response tersely explained what happened, but they used no partisan rhetoric. (chen has been through this type of trauma before, as his wife was once run over by what chen claims were kmt goons, paralyzing her from the waist down.) the same day, the kmt actually offered a reward greater than that of the government's to find information about the shooter(s), who fired while fireworks were being set off. now that chen has won reelection, however, many of lien's supporters feel that "a-bian"'s followers, or "greens," were somehow behind this attack, because obviously it's worth risking being murdered by a publicity stunt to boost reelection prospects. now, because of this incident, "chen activated a national security protocol, meaning 200,000 military and police -- traditionally nationalist supporters -- could not vote."  random bric-a-brac:   [+] deja vu? again, in the second round of the  urlLink ncaa tournament ...stanford  urlLink lost . just like the  urlLink a's . *TeaR* [+] mark cuban has a  urlLink blog ! he sounds smart; he talks about things like the "bounty" he set on bruce bowen for smacking around michael finley. it's ok though, the  urlLink mavs  suck. [+] britain might  urlLink keep its athletes out  of this summer's  urlLink athens olympics  thanks to the  urlLink 3/11 madrid bombings . wow.  [[happy belated birthday belinda]]

       the only things i care about right now are badminton, basketball and driving. maybe there's a little bit of schoolwork mixed in there, but i'm really saving that for next year because as i said, junior year can lick itself. (actually, i want to really understand chemistry and u.s. history, but not the way we're doing it.) anyway, today our precious badminton team played james logan...naturally we got murdered. naturally i was lost in the pre-game shuffle and forget to get a ride, so i biked over to the school...wasn't too bad, nice weather and quarry lake looked pretty nice. logan is one mother of a high school, i almost got lost in there (after passing about 20 couples making out in 20 unfindable hiding places). then i found the team and the festivities started and jennie and i were left off the matchups so we played some joke of a jv mixed doubles team that we wiped our toes with 11-6. personally i take it as an insult that i've been going to every practice and open gym all year, playing after school outside brookvale for an hour a day for around a month, going to a few irvington open gyms, staying as late as i can, biking to our first game just to be stuck with a throwaway match? how am i supposed to tell how i match up in an actual game environment if you pluck some random passersby and call that my opponent? tomorrow, i'm going to make a mark on our ladder...give me jv singles 4 for all i care, as long as i can win games and prove i belong on the team.  if i were to objectively look at myself, i would not understand what i see. i am definitely full of contradictions, if not certain cases of outright hypocrisy. i try to maintain a universal respect and kindness towards people, but there are those self-infatuated hosers who i cannot stand. i will be quiet and enjoy solitude, often avoiding groups or more generally people in conversation because i might interrupt or have nothing to say; yet with people i am comfortable with i can act really stupid and weird. i don't mind being passed over for someone who i know is my superior or more fun to be around, doing things for other people, performing the more menial tasks, starting from the bottom; however i bear a certain intrinsic competitive spirit if you will, a pride that will not allow myself to ask for help or take shortcuts, to accept something against my philosophy or below my standards. on a different tack, i often tell myself that today is the day things will change for me, that i'll learn from the past and finally make the right choices...but then i end up making the same mistakes as always. i avoid people for the same reason others avoid me, because for me being so aloof can sometimes make you yearn to be close to someone...yet being on one extreme too long, sometimes you get the tendency to push the other extreme too quickly and it's all gone. that's all i can say...i dream for the future but i live in the past.

       i've tended to complain a lot in my most recent posts, but today is probably the first time i can recall ever truly bearing a total lack of interest in school. period. maybe it's an unfortunate circumstance resulting from a lethal combination of lack of sleep, obscenely warm weather, and orlando losing about  urlLink 50 billion games in a row , but basically i have lost any remnants of caring for junior year. from the retarded pig monkey snot of precalculus (aka algebra 2/trigonometry II: bigger, longer, and just as pointless) to english (unofficially the world's largest collection of worthless and unnecessary knowledge) to history (please, please, don't get me started), to my newest synonym for free period that is called chemistry (sadly, i actually like the subject matter), to mandarin (which lost a good deal of fun once the native-speaking, uninspired freshmen flooded the class) to art (the class that 2/3 of the students don't take seriously and the other 1/3 just don't come).  you don't realize how badly i want senior year. oh, let me count the ways. challenging classes. interesting classes. new teachers. senior privileges. driving. one year closer to getting out of here. not being a junior. it's a shame...this year could've been something...

       i try my best to maintain my blog's appearance as a self-contained reflection of my thoughts independent of the trivial collection of complications that i like to call most things around me. it's not that i'm not concerned, it's just that if i bothered to worry about what person a had for breakfast on march 2, then i feel it's my obligation to find out what person m consumed for a midnight snack on february 30. it's a philosophical stand i'm taking, really. and to that end, i've recently found myself rather disinclined to partake in the artificiality of the internet's social interactions (hence my absence from xanga-browsing, chatting, blogging, lurking, flaming, comment-whoring, the whole shizbang). still, i couldn't help but notice, quite bemusedly, that the absence of my irregular abusal of your bandwidth has been missed. as usual, for that sentiment i'm gratified...and tickled. (to be specific, on that little crevice right above the heel on my left foot. but not too fast, it occasionally breaks out into rashes.) don't fool yourselves into thinking that's why i'm posting tonight, though. this blog is creative release and nothing more.   my dad, brother and i went to eat at sweet tomatoes today, and there was this one asian guy with really japanese-ish big eyes sitting forlornly at the wall farthest from the buffet. i don't know if any of you are concerned about this type of drivel, but i suddenly had a rush of thoughts. what i would wish for everybody in the world is to have a friend. not to the point of a soulmate, but just someone beside you to be a sounding board, a pillar of strength, someone to lean on or pretend your jokes are funny, a person to save you from the hurt of being alone. (and yet what's funny is that i relish my time by myself, so maybe i'm concerned for no real reason.) nevertheless, it's one of those self-perpetuating worries in the world, for once you recognize (any) need of one person, you become subsequently conscious of the same need shared by millions across the globe. and then what good does it do to help this one person who's down on their luck? why do they deserve your sympathy, your caring, your compassion more than anybody else deserves it? and the answer is simply that you're there and you can. just a thought.

       it's that time again, as i present my annual texas instruments' godiva basketball playoffs short-sighted preview analysis once-over diddly thingamabobber presented by pizza hut and sponsored by tampax tampons (do you want  your  period to be comfortable?). but before that, i shall ingratiate myself and nobody else by giving a cheap plug to my failure of a fantasy basketball team and the players on that team (or anybody else's for that matter, just cuz i feel like it) that i wish to make babies with. no unnecessary bench players, except for a sixth man. AND a seventh man (more like an honorary position, as you will see if you bother scrolling down [which you will, because that unfinished sentence at the bottom of the screen is very tempting {hmm, how many tangentially inane comments can i add to one sentence?}]). cuz it's my blog, dammit.  point guard: jalen rose, toronto raptors. i have to offer belated thanks to james for trading this 6'8" baller (and member of michigan's fab five) from detroit to me (along with the nba's leading shot-blocker theo ratliff for the schizophrenic yao ming, who on some days looks more like an asian gheorge muresan). rose himself was traded by chicago along with donyell marshall, but their collective talent paired with vince carter and chris bosh could not bring the turnaround the only nba team in canada was hoping for.  yes, jalen is not a point, but he's long and he does have passable ... er ... passing skills, a great scoring touch (with almost no vertical leap on his jump shot), and the post-up talent required at the three.   shooting guard: if you have to ask...  small forward: rashard lewis, seattle supersonics. yes, for opening my eyes to this straight-from-HS dunking whiz, i must give due pleasantries to erik (who got the one-dimensional reggie miller clone richard hamilton in return). unfortunately, lewis is a maddeningly enigmatic mixed bag of ambiguity. in the sonics' second game of the year (in japan versus the pitiful los angeles clippers), lewis busted out a career-high 50 points, revealing to the world his amazing stroke and posting ability. in addition, his great vertical leap leads to some thunderous dunks and high rebounding statistics. unfortunately, he has just as often been found missing (oxymoron) on the court, unable to take control because of his passive tendency to defer to sharpshooter ray allen when the going gets tough. if he gains size and aggressiveness, he could truly become a star.  power forward: drew gooden, orlando magic. (carlos boozer has great hops and presence but a smaller shooting range, inability to do much besides shoot and rebound, and relies too often on his pedestrian "monster" jams. nazr mohammad hasn't proven himself yet, but at least he can get some blocks.) not another potential talent that can't bring 100% every night! and he's somewhat small for the four, but gooden can be a talented shooter, rebounder and shot-blocker when he has motivation and juwan howard isn't doing the exact same thing (except for the shot-blocking and talent part). stupid johnny davis playing him at the three, GOODEN ISN'T QUICK ENOUGH ON DEFENSE. not much else to say except orlando should trade howard and keep him.  center: tim duncan, san antonio spurs. who doesn't want him? the reigning nba mvp, two-time nba finals mvp, sports illustrated co-sportsman of the year (along with all-time great david robinson), he is just that rare player who lets his actions do the talking. and boy does he have a lot of actions. perenially ranking at the top in the league in scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking, and exhibiting halfway-decent passes and handles, he (like the unstoppable kevin garnett) are individual teams. duncan is so consistently impressive, with graceful pivot moves and that trademark kiss off the glass, steady defense and a heartening lack of violent gesticulations and showboating, and a human shortcoming in his slowly deteriorating free-throw percentage, that it is quite difficult to omit him off any partly serious list of the greatest players in league history.   sixth man: kirk hinrich, chicago bulls. finally i've enlisted a true point guard, one who along with the injured nick collison led kansas to the final four and a showdown with 'melo, with the confidence to rain threes like so much precipitation (even with a notoriously streaky stroke), weave between defenders to thread a pass down the lane, drive up the sideline to dunk it on somebody's grille, and actually play lockdown defense (almost as rare as four-point plays these days). hinrich has amazing energy and adapts to any coach's schemes with ease. unfortunately, his considerable efforts have done little to help chicago out of their deep poophole.  seventh man: penny hardaway, new york knicks (but let's pretend orlando magic for my sake). DAMN HE WAS SO GOOD. this junior high kid that babysat me when i was at kindergarten age, he had penny's third-color pinstriped jersey. i drew his goatee all the time. AAH. his grandmother inadvertently named him penny because her southern accent slurred the t's and r in "pretty." i remember how he had those great battles with michael jordan, john stockton, nick van exel, jason kidd, whomever. he could dunk and shoot and pass and post like nobody's business, and along with shaquille o'neal, orlando made it to the nba finals only to get SWEPT by rudy tomjanovich's houston rockets with hakeem olajuwon and sam cassell. he won a gold medal at the 1996 olympic games. hell, he was all over sports illustrated for kids. STUPID KNEE INJURY CRAP. now he sorta sucks.  holy crap, that was a little longer than i wanted. but now here i go with playoff predictions. they shall be brief, to spare your tired, your huddled, your completely closed eyes...   divisional playoffs  indiana over cleveland in 5 new york over new jersey in 6 (assuming kidd is still injured) detroit over new orleans in 4 miami over milwaukee in 7 (great matchup, odom > van horn)  los angeles over portland in 5 minnesota over houston in 6 sacramento over dallas in 6 memphis over san antonio in 6 (spurs last year > this year)   conference semifinals  indiana over new york in 6 detroit over miami in 6  los angeles over memphis in 6 (lakers vs. jerry west, cool) sacramento over minnesota in 7 (webber shall be finally 100%)   conference finals  detroit over indiana in 7 los angeles over sacramento in 7 (the NBA NEEDS this series)   nba finals  los angeles over detroit in 6, mvp: kobe bryant   end of season awards  most valuable player: kevin garnett defensive player of the year: ron artest rookie of the year: lebron james and carmelo anthony most improved player: zach randolph coach of the year: hubie brown

       why t-mac is unequivocally greater than kobe. (just to give you something new to read.)   It's easily one of the world's most electrifying rivalries today, the prospect of which never fails to make basketball fans across the world salivate lustfully. Delving into the annals of history, it is quite difficult to find pairings of such comparable magnitude and consequence. One has to search back to classical times to find an equivalent event, like the Greeks with their thousand ships defeating the Trojans after a ten-year siege. With presidents, you have the pivotal Nixon vs. Kennedy debates. One could even go out on a very trendy limb to incorporate modern literature and count Harry Potter whipping the undead behind of Lord Voldemort as a similar rivalry. And now in the National Basketball Association, the home of dozens of legendary one-on-one battles over the years, we have a budding rivalry between superstar guards too good for college: Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant. However, looking objectively at their backgrounds, considerable accomplishments and obscene talent, it is quite clear that the man known simply as T-Mac in sports circles is more deserving of greatness.  All true legends have to start from somewhere, and even at childhood, Kobe Bryant seemed to have had a prescient knowledge that he would someday end up in the ranks of the true basketball greats. Born on August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bryant -- named after a Japanese steakhouse in his hometown -- inherited his amazing athletic propensity from his father and star point guard "Jellybean" Joe Bryant. Naturally, a confident Kobe was declaring himself a future NBA star at the wizened old age of three; unfortunately, Bryant's father could not find his niche in said league, and he ended up lugging his family to Italy to play. Throughout this trying experience, young Kobe was unfazed, still watching NBA games with a passion and latching himself onto the mesmerizing Los Angeles Laker point guard Magic Johnson, whose team Kobe would anoint as his favorite. This would inspire him to fervently study moves and techniques of his rejuvenated father and of NBA tapes sent from his grandparents, all bundled with Joe's patient advice at no extra charge. In 1992, Joe finally decided to retire and return the family to Philadelphia. While the reserved Kobe seamlessly integrated onto the varsity basketball team of Lower Merion High School -- 31.1 points per game, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists, all the while managing a B average -- his years of quiet solitude in Italy left him completely nonplussed in terms of dealing with American teenagers. No matter how hard he tried to become just an ordinary kid, his aloofness would prove to be an Achilles heel of sorts for him later in his career. Nevertheless, not even the coolly assured Bryant could contemplate the impact his future career would bring to basketball.  In contrast to Bryant's introverted personality, the tall, lanky Tracy McGrady found it nearly second nature to "keep it real," easily juggling his sports demands with friends and a highly loving family. Born on May 24, 1979 in Bartow, Florida, McGrady -- who had to move to nearby Auburndale with his grandmother because his young mom couldn't afford to single-handedly care for him -- actually found himself first drawn to baseball, where he wowed onlookers with blazing fastballs and bat speed. However, with the meteoric rise of the University of Memphis phenom Anfernee Hardaway, a flashy rookie point guard on the hometown Orlando Magic, McGrady was inspired to take his fleeting enjoyment of roundball to a new plateau. With this new goal firmly entrenched in his mind, his game witnessed a stunning explosion -- 23 points, 12 rebounds per game -- yet he couldn't transfer this passion off the court, where he was vilified as a habitually lazy student who would skip classes. (Indeed, like Bryant's sheltered childhood, this would turn out to be McGrady's ultimate shortcoming.) To drill this indolence out of the boy, his high school coach directed him to attend Mt. Zion Christian Academy in North Carolina -- touted as a highly successful boot camp for basketball stars -- for his senior year. It immediately paid dividends, as McGrady earned a reputation as a transcendent phenom (27.5 points per game, 8.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists) and lockdown defensive stopper (2.7 steals). With the body of a small forward, explosiveness of a shooting guard and court vision of a point guard, T-Mac's unstoppable talent would soon be put to a real test.  However, McGrady would have to wait for his opportunity to play with the big boys as the older Kobe Bryant was the first of the two prodigies to declare for the National Basketball Association. After a few deals and haggling on Draft Day 1996, Kobe found himself on the organization of his dreams -- in Hollywood, with the Los Angeles Lakers. Expectations were soaring for the "next Michael Jordan," and although he experienced a lackluster rookie campaign, his sophomore year saw him bringing contagious energy and double-digit points off the bench as the sixth man. Though rewarded with a starting position in the All-Star Game, his near-legendary aloofness reared its immature head as Bryant played one on five with the ball glued to his hand -- he was subsequently benched in the fourth quarter. So in the summer of 1999, to simultaneously rein in and unleash this burgeoning star's near-limitless potential, Los Angeles brought in legendary head coach Phil Jackson. Bryant immediately responded, exhibiting his newly-acquired defensive footwork and improved shot selection allowed by the free-moving triangle offense to help lead the team to an NBA Championship. Yet despite his amazing success -- two more league championships and murmurs of a growing dynasty -- Kobe continued to display his selfish tendencies on the court and trademark reserve off the court. A staple of his style of basketball, he would often be found forcing shots when teammates had wide open looks at the basket; he would practice alone, taking nearly a thousand jumpers a day; while his teammates were dressing and socializing before games, he would often be found in a corner silently bopping to music. Perhaps this was the downfall of his that led to his infamous Denver hotel stay and allegations of a sexual attack on a female employee -- could it be possible he had simply not learned how to handle this situation? Regardless of this outcome, Bryant has already had an illustrious NBA career, all the while winning legions of fans with his quiet demeanor and confident -- if somewhat arrogant -- game. However, another question continues to dog him -- how would he have fared without Jackson as a mentor and 340-pound Shaquille O'Neal as another threat?  Tracy McGrady's career launched from a much different, less Disney-esque path than Bryant's, as he was drafted on 1997 by a team he felt little connection with -- the brand-spanking-new Toronto Raptors. Unfortunately, as the injury-plagued team tanked in that regular season, so did McGrady's reputation -- Coach Darrell Walker was wholly unimpressed with McGrady's apparent lethargy, and as such rarely allowed his bench seat to cool. However, with their horrendous winning percentage came a coaching change; the new head honcho Butch Carter treated Tracy with the realistic discipline he needed, and the rookie started heading into practices with fire in his eyes. With McGrady gaining fifteen pounds of muscle, the Raptors' next two years were minor successes as the sophomore's scoring and defensive energy off the bench had risen tremendously. Highly desired as a free agent, he returned home to the Orlando Magic, where coach Doc Rivers promised to build a winning franchise around incoming superstar Grant Hill with Tracy as a sidekick. A season-ending ankle injury to Hill, however, forced McGrady to shoulder the burden alone, and he performed admirably, ultimately becoming the year's Most Improved Player. In subsequent years, T-Mac blossomed into a bona fide superstar, carrying Orlando to the playoffs three straight years nearly single-handedly (whereas Bryant's opponents were slightly distracted by O'Neal, a known initiator of solar eclipses) all the while showcasing a timing and affinity for passes that eclipsed Bryant. Through the years of exhaustive work, McGrady has never forgotten to reach out to the community -- especially children -- as he has donated extensive and unheralded amounts of time and money to adolescents in need in south Florida. While he currently exhibits a much-maligned laziness on defense as a result of being the only threat on the Orlando offense, T-Mac nonetheless has displayed the awesome talent, leadership ability, and humility cementing his status as a marquee player in the Association.   Quickly glossing over this post, one may have skipped over some vital differences in the histories of these two fiery young NBA superstars. While Kobe Bryant was born in the relative lap of basketball luxury, Tracy McGrady grew up with his struggling grandmother. While Kobe Bryant enjoyed personal mentoring from his father on all aspects of the game, Tracy McGrady was sent to a basketball school hundreds of miles from home. While Kobe Bryant had the stunning fortune to be coached by dynasty-creator Phil Jackson and teamed with mammoth center Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady was forced to make do with a second-year coach and literally no second scorer to divert attention. Yet, Tracy McGrady has led the league in scoring for two years in a row, and consistently leads his team in assists, steals, rebounds and three-point field-goal percentage. All of these accomplishments are accompanied by McGrady's loyalty to disadvantaged and directionless children in Orlando, as he never fails to bring smiles to their faces notwithstanding his fortunes on the hardwood floor. While Kobe Bryant may one day have to mull over his discomfort with life's temptations from the county jail, T-Mac has the lure of walking in Anfernee Hardaway's footsteps to credit for becoming possibly the greatest second fiddle in league history.

       i would have gone to sleep except i was inspired to post by listening to another stirring rendition of "don't tell me" by avril lavigne. i only like the guitar riff before the chorus (or hook, for all you out there down wit' it, foo), so shoot me. it's funny how she trumpets the fact that she finally ditched the stifling conformity of other songwriters for her new album so she could write her own lyrical masterpieces. oh, here we go. let's listen to her brilliant lines!   while you gave me that kiss, there was something like this/that made me go oh oh.   does canada offer english class? obviously you only know the correct way to speak french, because "this," acting much like a pronoun, would imply that there was a related main idea you had previously stated so you could properly use "this" to rhyme with "kiss." EXCEPT THERE IS NO RELATED MAIN IDEA, so you used "this" because you're too stupid to think of another word that rhymed. got that? ("that" being a pronoun to represent this entire paragraph, which would be what we call in the states "proper grammar.") and you said "oh oh" in a song? then you rhyme "love" and "trust"? YOU'RE FUCKING KIDDING ME.  why did you have to go?  this, i would normally have no problem with. innocent statement. except you COMPLETELY contradict it later in your song when you squeal, "don't think...the fact that your arm is now around my neck." you JUST SAID "why did you have to go," implying the guy's gone. now he's presently groping your neck? and your chorus says "did you think that i was gonna give it up to you?" how can you give it up to someone who is GONE? shut up.  did you think that i was gonna give it up to you? did you think that it was something i was gonna do?  wtf, you said the first line then you said, "i won't do what i said i won't do in the first line!" pulitzer, anyone?  i'll have to kick your ass/and make you never forget  first off, a guy that gets his ass kicked by you is really fucking weak. or maybe you meant that line literally. you better have. (and you rhymed "pants" with "ass," which means this sucks regardless.) "and make you never forget" is just a throwaway line that means nothing (if you kicked his ass wouldn't he already remember that?), tossed in because it RHYMES, which you DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO. idiot.   i'm gonna ask you to stop, thought i liked you a lot, but i'm really upset  dear god. so you'll ask him to stop. first, how fucking stupid are you to tell someone you're gonna ask him to stop before you actually tell him to stop? you don't care if he actually stops or not, you just want to tell him to stop. go feminism. and you're really upset? horrors. go call the u-fucking-n.  yeah that's what i said  you're pathetic.  now let's make fun of the prototypical hip-hop song "40 oz." by d-12! oh joy, equal opportunity satirization! first, let's have some random mc yell derogatory racial epithets and random f-bombs just so we can pretend we're hardcore!   you know how we get nigga, we wild in the club motherfuckers  then, let's realize this whole song is centered around a stereotype of drunk, violent, bitch-slapping african americans!   where the 40 at? guzzle it!  then let's have bizarre yell 3 words a line about shooting people and smacking hoes and smoking blunts!   one of y'all niggaz gon' catch a slug i'm so drunk, i can hurl for a month... ain't got no problem with slapping no bitch... blunts, gans, that's all we smoke  then eminem can yell the same thing using more words!   who's trying to be the first one to catch this blade in the throat you kno them po-po won't let me hold them toasters no mo'... chuggin' on our 40's and holdin our forty-fo's  then kuniva can repeat them again while employing unnecessary imagery that adds absolutely nothing to the song! (how many exclamation points can i use before you get annoyed and stop reading!)    i settle my vendettas with ak's, barettas... switch blade, brass knuckles, nickel-plated belt buckles broken beer bottles...bitches cryin'  then proof can repeat all of the aforementioned smokers-drinkers-shooters-stabbers-slappers ONE MORE TIME just in case you're half-deaf and you didn't hear them the FIRST THREE TIMES!   if your chick get loud, i'll g-money that bitch packin' mags and clips, i'll smash your clique... smoking weed, drinking henny, remy and that jimmy  go hip-hop.  finally, here's my rendition of a generic punk rock song.  "go away" -- really fast   go away! that's what the title of this song says really fast! that's how fast i want you to run, cuz i don't like you anymore, but also that's the name of my band, which is funny because all punk is the same i rock, i don't even need a rhyming dictionary or a songwriter...aw shit...pictionary is a fun game, anyway, i want to sing about hating you because its you i want to live without  (chorus) go away! i don't like you! i want to be alone i want to be myself, you make me not my own once you go away! i'll finally know who i really am not the person you made me to be, that's not who i am  i made it to the second verse without repeating myself i'm so happy, oh wait we're still recording huh, shit

        "The first scene of "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" removes any doubt that the famous child wizard is growing up fast. The camera glides toward a light pulsing in the night, then through an open bedroom window, where Harry is hiding under his covers, playing with his wand and hoping to God he doesn't get caught. Wait a minute. Has new director Alfonso Cuaron inserted a sneaky allusion to the private habits of teenage boys into the family-friendly franchise? Cuaron's a warm, chatty guy and not one to dodge controversy—his last film, "Y Tu Mama Tambien," was so graphic that it was released unrated—but there's no way on earth he's going anywhere near this topic. "This is NEWSWEEK, man!" he says, then laughs for a very long time."  urlLink continued...    "The tests revealed the fact that Ruth is 90 per cent efficient compared with a human average of 60 per cent. That his eyes are about 12 per cent faster than those of the average human being. That his ears function at least 10 per cent faster than those of the ordinary man. That his nerves are steadier than those of 499 out of 500 persons. That in attention and quickness of perception he rated one and a half times above the human average. That in intelligence, as demonstrated by the quickness and accuracy of understanding, he is approximately 10 per cent above normal."  urlLink explained...   and finally, just to try to win over those people who think baseball is boring and stupid. with a boring and stupid essay! oh the irony.   The spectrum ranges from bland indifference to wild fervor, from cursory interest to ecstatic loyalty, from ignorant boredom to dedicated appreciation. Arguably nothing in today’s world elicits such a broad range of reactions as does America’s national pastime, the sport of baseball. Revered by boys and girls of over five generations, it has unfailingly inspired teamwork, dedication, and desire in all – winners and losers – who had the privilege to fit a glove onto their hand. Although a miniscule percentage of these potential Willie Mays actually end up donning the uniform of a Major League Baseball team, these children still have the enviable opportunity to stand in that grass and allow 165 years of history to wash over them. Yet, as the clock has turned to the 21st century, rumblings abound regarding the undesirability of newer aspects of the game. Debt-ridden franchises. Shrinking stadiums and home-run exhibitions. Steroids. Is the unwelcome arrival of these modern factors really diluting the classic quality of the game of baseball? However, as 28,055 fans per game can attest, roadblocks such as these are inconsequential – as long as there are four bases, nine players, a ball and a bat, the magic of this noble sport can never die. 	 Baseball has endured so many tumultuous generations of American society because of its unchanging, accessible nature. Due to their limited relevance with the short attention span of our culture, many fads and trends fade throughout the generations as flimsy products wrapped in dazzling packaging. This painful truth has caused many hopeful summer attractions to be tossed by the wayside – limited IMAX theaters, slow scooters and roller-skates, monotonous laser tag games, repetitive beach visits. Countless other possible realms of family entertainment have become so prohibitively expensive that multiple excursions are not an affordable option for many parents. Football tickets easily start at $70 a person, while theme parks usually begin at $50; movie tickets have crested the $9 level while the flicks themselves continue to wither away in the Cinematic Void of Trite Banality™; the exploding popularity of videogames contributes to indolence and unsociability in those who persist in shelling out $50 per disc. Furthermore, excepting the first two examples, all of these costly outings have little true value in terms of family bonding and everlasting memories. It is rather difficult to have a meaningful father-son conversation regarding the excessive amounts of red dye spilled in Kill Bill, and hardly anyone recalls when Yuna reached Level 39 in Final Fantasy X-2. In stark contrast to all these flawed ideas of group gatherings, decent baseball tickets cost $18 each (children’s tickets can go as low as $4), offer families over three hours of bonding time uninterrupted by loud noises and gaudy special effects, and bestow to many needy kids the foreign sight of the sun. While these parents tell their children stories of games they had attended with their own fathers and mothers – of thrilling late-inning rallies and walk-off home runs and classic pitching duels – they are simultaneously creating new memories for their kids to tell someday. In this age of instant gratification, larger thrills and shocking visuals, this intrinsic value of merely going to a baseball game – at such an affordable cost – can not be overlooked.  	 While it is readily noticeable that baseball offers an opportunity for a wholesome family get-together complete with excitement, community and LOW, LOW PRICES, it is slightly more difficult to attain an appropriate appreciation of these visits to the ballpark. After spending much time with an average assortment of adolescent athletes, the impression one generally receives is that football and basketball are by far superior sports insofar as to their suspense and excitement. After all, football has big tackles and long touchdown runs, while roundball presents to its viewers flashy uniforms and titillating dunks. However, as many wizened spectators of spectators will contend, there are few moments in any sport that can compare with two outs, two strikes, one on, down by one. Or a 2-2 count on the 27th batter with a perfect game on the line. Or #660. Baseball has no irritating tension-killing timeouts, irritating tension-killing instant replay, game-lengthening intentional fouls, or chances to call your friends in the end zone. The game only stops between half-innings and pitchers or during rain – otherwise the drama continues. Another incomparable aspect of baseball is its long years of tradition. With the new age of egotistical athletes, old rules are broken during nearly every game of most sports – rookies dunk over veterans, players grandstand at the 50-yard line, lethal punches are unleashed on unsuspecting opponents. On the other hand, baseball overwhelms newcomers with its ageless customs partaken by fans decades ago – the first pitch, choruses of boos to certain deserving players, President Taft’s seventh-inning stretch, “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” standing ovations, the World Series. These traditions of baseball do not change in part because they cannot change, for all possible variables are so masterfully controlled that subtle balance always wins every evolutionary fight. Other sports reward unbounded athletic development – teams with superior size and speed in football and basketball unfailingly prevail. Fortunately, baseball is a much more fickle woman when it comes to her preferred partner. Bring a man too strong, and his bat speed will be pitifully slow and his foot speed even more so. Bring a man too light, and he’ll barely push pitches past those ubiquitous bench coaches. Ingest too many steroids, and his batting form will unalterably change, losing continuity, effectiveness and power. Never vary your tendencies, and infields will shift to ready the double play, while outfielders will shift to catch the easy flyout. Few sports in the American mainstream present to viewers such a perfect meld of strategy and pageantry, tradition and passion, tension and timelessness. 	 Ever since 1839, in Cooperstown, New York, when Abner Doubleday (supposedly) derived its rules from the then-popular game “town ball” – where 20+ boys tried to catch a ball hit by another boy’s bat – baseball has undergone some foundation-rocking revisions. From Babe Ruth’s 714 home runs to Hank Aaron’s 755, from the introduction of the designated hitter to the introduction of Jackie Robinson, from Bobby Bonds’ induction to the 30/30 club to the admission of his son Barry, this sport has definitely evolved throughout the years. Yet with all its rule changes, multimillionaire deals and mascot controversies, through 101 World Series and nine commissioners, after steroids and creatine and THG, baseball has always been – and will continue to be – nothing more than a game with the deceptively simple goal of striking ball with wood. Nothing more than our national pastime. Nothing more than pleasing those fans. As a player once famously said, “A man has to have goals for a day, for a lifetime, and that was mine – to have people say, ‘There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.’” What fitting honor for him to be the greatest hitter who ever lived, playing nothing more than the greatest sport ever played.

         enjoy.   let's talk about our president's speech today real fast. not too bad a speech, considering what happened to our earlier motive for the war on iraq (nuclear weapons? we were after nuclear weapons?). and the only major misstep was his mangling of abu ghraib prison ("abu gharib"). i seriously felt sorry for him while he was fishing for the correct pronunciation. besides that, the poor man needs to realize we are in the 21st century, not in the 1950s, and that there's no need to disprove any "assumptions" that we came to iraq as permanent occupiers and colonizers.   also, with 138,000+ soldiers stationed in combat, 17,000-ish from our "coalition" allies just won't cut it. yet, as bush continues to entreaty other nations to join us in the effort to stabilize iraq (a little late, don't you think), it's hard to forget our initial unilateral plunge into iraq, which also singlehandedly illustrated the worthlessness of the united nations. as it stands, europe must feel like america's that annoying little brother who blindly jumped into wussified-iraqi-dictator-beatdown-day and only now wants help to clean up the mess.

       before anything else, happy birthday to claire, who i stole the evening of may 18th from...she took the coolness and brains and talent, and left me with a measly y chromosome. and happy belated birthday basho.  wow...i've never actually had a birthday like today. i don't really relish the attention, and it was really awkward when weissenborn plunked me in the middle of the class in history to feel 29+ students' eyes bore into my unprotected soul, or their books, whatever they preferred. i'm just really grateful to the people who went out of their way just to say happy birthday...i know i forgot a lot of birthdays this year but i still tried to be nice to everybody regardless. and i wouldn't mention this except i've bitched about my dad a lot here and old readers might have a distorted impression of him but...he actually called me this morning to say happy birthday...that was something. of course my brother doesn't care.  if you guys read this...amanda (ng), i was glad to, those were good times...and it's always fun to complain about friends' brothers...anytime you need it i'm here. ankur, that book is the shit, i don't know what i did to earn something like that but thanks. cassandra and kim, you guys REALLY didn't have to...it's the first time i've had friends do that for me. debbie, thanks, it's hella cool, i wanted one for hecka days...obviously it replaced my crappy kobe one, who wants a loser's poster anyway :-D erik, haha, "after 24 months of non-use of this GiftCard, a monthly service fee of $2 will be charged per month against any remaining balance"...that means it's worth about -$43 now. but thanks. and caroline...*you'll get it*.  goodness...claire, kat, jenn, jen, pat, belinda, elyse, IRA, amita, adam, parisa, basho, amanda ho, eugenes, owen, whitney, justin, alexes, lisa, melissa, selena, jennie, tiana, tam, mei, arlette, lauren, greg, tommy, esthers, jen chou, jen lu, dexter, jun, joanna, gloria, rita, charmaine, richard, sunny, jesha, joanne, charles, heather, michelle, vicky, jenny, debbie, linda, tina, tiffany...haha i'm not cut out for this birthday stuff...  i went to  urlLink badminton alley  today, and i ordered a  urlLink yonex carbonex 300 muscle power  (3u, 22 lbs)! holy crap it's so awesome.

       first things first, i wish people wouldn't change.  alright, so yesterday was my brother's birthday so my mom came to visit us and i got to drive around a lot. we had the banquet yesterday, then today i went with my family to eat some dim sum and watch  urlLink troy . even though it was rated r, it's kinda sad that it made less money than val helsing because it really was a treat to watch. and it had sean bean with a decent-sized role, you can't beat that. spoilers abound, bitches.   for the uninitiated, the movie revolves around the spartans of greece and the trojans of...troy (ok, somewhere near turkey)...around 1200 bc. guy (paris, prince of troy played very effeminately by orlando bloom) has affair with married girl (helen, queen of sparta, played by token bland pretty girl), girl's fat husband (token fat guy the age of his wife's grandfather) gets pissed and whines for brother (ditto) to bitchslap aforementioned effeminate guy with oh, a thousand ships or so. too bad token fat brother's idealistic superhero leader achilles (brad pitt, who might as well have been naked the whole movie) refuses to fight this  urlLink trojan war  under his self-serving rule, and spartan morale subsequently falls. so we have a stalemate and troy is winning thanks to their only FIGHTER WITH BALLS(tm), big prince hector (eric bana, who has big ears). but when he "unintentionally" punks out achilles' cousin, it's over. big fights, prodigious trojan horse of sloppy construction, and achilles dies (by paris's arrow in the heel no less). audible gasp.  now with my unwelcome and underqualified analysis. this was a grand epic movie with some great views of the many thousand-strong armies and ships, decent music, non-throwaway lines by all the actors, nice buildup to the big battles (like the prerequisite donning of the armor), and  urlLink peter o'fucking toole . he's so badass, and they respect his authoritah with some really appropos scenes. the only nitpick i have with this movie is how they treat hector in the end, with his big battle against achilles. everyone and their greataunt knew achilles would win, just by his endless taunting, prancing and SURVIVING UNSCATHED. on the other hand, troy's famed champion is left slashed in the leg, crawling pitifully for his spear. but when achilles dies, he sits there breathing heavily for 5 minutes (long enough for him to make out with his girl 3 times). nevertheless, awesome flick.  edit 11:42 PM:  Peter: Oh my God, Brian! There's a message in my Alpha Bits! It says "Oooooo!" Brian: Peter, those are Cheerios.

       hmm, another year of spring sports has come and gone, this time being badminton. what is there to say...our team showed good improvement and could get better, but with our gym being so cramped and low-quality, our coach being new...eh, that's why we have summer. i want to be good though, i want to be able to hit the birdie and know where it's going to land and what the probable return will be, all that stuff. i've told people before (during my countless apologies to the track team) that i wish i could do both sports, but i'm just not athletic enough for running competitively i suppose. but watching some players on our team...the quickness, footwork, control, mental aspects of badminton are a little easier for me to pick up on. and throughout the season, it was kinda inspiring to see them scrape and claw to the very end.  brings me to the seniors, most of whom (unless they play in college) are done with interschool games. for me, this is the first year where i actually know a decent amount of graduates, so i guess it'll be the first time i'll feel that loss when june 17 comes rolling around. the seniors i know are great, they're the ones that joke with you and make you forget they're a year older and taking a whole bunch of different classes. there's no use in any tributary posts yet, but they should know that school's going to feel a little smaller next year.  edit 11:46 PM: sigh, spurs lost. good run. kobe's dunk on duncan was nice.      urlLink banquet ! ha, i'm so retarded.

       if you guys read this, congratulations to amanda (3rd place girls singles) and liss (6th place). holy crap they're so crazy, they played like 6 games each today. c'mon, bring those rubber bands.   summer plan:  in the air: job at newark  urlLink score  june 21-july 29: microbiology and infectious diseases?, badminton @  urlLink ohlone  (hopefully with new obscenely expensive  urlLink muscle power  racket borne out of my greedy birthday wishes) first week of august: washington d.c. trip all throughout: beat mario and luigi  holy shit those motherfucking lakers are crazy little bitches. damn those clutch shots!  i got this week's  urlLink espn the mag . i love it:  "The Benefactor": Mark Cuban hands out $1 million for no reason.

Mary-Jane Watson: Your Spidey-sense is very strong, but any idiot could pick that up. Spidey, why do you protect me? Spider-Man: That's an easy decision. Not as easy as the decision to purchase MLB.TV on my laptop for the low, low price of $14.95 a month. You get 280 live streaming games each month, right on your computer. But I want someone to watch those exciting interleague games with me, MJ, so I have no choice but to protect you. Mary-Jane: Oh, Spidey, I had no idea. Kiss me.  Aunt May: Peter, your Uncle Ben once told you that with great power comes great responsibility. But I worry that your power may be chemically enhanced.

         yeah yeah,  urlLink friends  is gone. and i've barely watched any episodes so i don't really have a right to opine substantially about it. but i will anyway. it got 50 million viewers, although seinfeld's finale garnered 75 million and mash finished with over 100. looking at the finale critically, it was somewhat contrived and formulaic...the whole plane thing was ridiculous, and chandler came off as irritatingly neurotic in the hospital. but the show also was blessed with those scenes that tug at those proverbial heartstrings no matter how much you expect them. goodbye to the foosball table...rachel coming back for ross (everybody knew she would)...putting away the keys in the empty room ("were the walls always purple?")...the age-old walk into the sunset. the show was never terribly revolutionary, sharp, or classic, but it was steady comfort for the millions of viewers who wished to invite a few friends over every thursday night.  hmm, i need a reason to continue this post. we just had our ap tests this last week, but i don't find them so much of a hassle as much as an impetus to actually learn information. (and an excuse to conveniently deny my precal text's existence.) not that i enjoy the anal-retentive essays and ridiculously meticulous questioning in the multiple choice, but it gives you a reason to remember the more important aspects of the curriculum. as in, i still don't give a crap why *insert 50's sitcom here* contributed to the supposed homogenization of american society, but i appreciate being able to connect the middle east and vietnam in a more thorough manner. chemistry shall make my tear ducts flow, however. FLOW.   urlLink iraqi prisoner abuse . no long-winded speech from me today. i agree that these soldiers here are pathetic, utter crap. at the same time, i've had it with democratic critics like ted kennedy (my favorite kennedy ever) and every liberal newspaper on the planet who perpetually espouse their self-righteous bullshit of "it leads straight to the top." even though this shouldn't have happened, this is more of a reagan-esque sleeping on the job mishap than a hierarchical collapse of the military. let the prison guards' immediate supervisors deal with this crap. anywho, i think it's ashcroft, not rumsfeld, that should go.    urlLink last samurai ! that movie is hella hella cool. if you haven't guessed yet, i have it and i want to watch it with friends after testing is over so i have an excuse to go driving. on a second viewing, it's still a crazy good movie, although it focuses on tom cruise a smidgeon too much. after katsumoto dies (such a great scene) and the uncultured fartfaced japanese soldiers bow, why are we still gaping at tom cruise's unblemished mug? the emperor is hella cool..."we have weapons and western clothing. but we must still remember who we are, and where we come from."  holy shit, all of a sudden i have stuff to talk about. here we gooo...   [+]  urlLink harry potter 3  baby! with that edgy new cuaron director person, supercool gary oldman as sirius black (who WASN'T sexy in the books, a fallacy widely spread by an iranian person from greece whose name rhymes with parisa), a badass-looking malfoy and the best actor of the heroes in rupert grint, it should be a LOT better than the first two. [+] i have changed my brackets a bit:  spurs over lakers in 6 kings over timberwolves in 7 pacers over heat in 4 pistons over nets in 6  spurs over kings in 7 pistons over pacers in 6  spurs over pistons in 7 the lakers, indeed, are nothing more than a grouping of individuals...an exhausted shaq, selfish kobe, passive malone and OLD payton. all the west teams besides the spurs are having their lack of cohesiveness sorely tested, and san antonio shall pounce like rabid, sars-infested dalmations. the wolves and indiana need better centers, which is also the only true weakness of san antonio. [+] spiderman-2. it looks beautiful. as i worry with all hyped sequels (see above), it better look like the first. in other words, no excessive special effects, no drastic mood changes, no ugly plot contrivances. that's why lotr worked so well, because it flowed so smoothly from movie to movie.

       hmm, what convoluted little ideas could innocent ol' ryan be fomenting in his convoluted little head today, i wonder?    holy shit i hate chevy. i really do. it kills me. thinking about how shitty a company it is is really depressing. i should go buzz their goddam ceo right now to tell him to slice a rib off and suck his own cock. those goddam phonies. i hate nissan too. and gmc. and ford. and every other fucking car company that has the audacity to trumpet their gas-guzzling, carbon monoxide-spewing, space-wasting, rollover-prone, bottom-line-padding, parking-space-stealing pieces of shit they dare to call " urlLink sport utility vehicles ." not to mention the assholes who are mindlessly coerced into this retarded bigger-is-better mentality that makes america the gluttony king of the whole wide universe, while suv companies giggle their punkasses to the bank.  don't you love those ubiqutious commercials where a random suv will trumpet that it's the ONLY SUV WITH A TRITON VWX-1600 ENGINE or the ONLY SUV WITH  urlLink ZZ-TOP  SUSPENSION or the ONLY SUV WITH REMOVABLE DOOR HANDLES? or how about the ads that toot their horn about having the largest towing capacity in their class? our armada can tow 20 more pounds than your expedition. neener-neener. now when i'm towing my whole fucking house around i can bring along my math book too! then there's those ass-backward chevy commercials that espouse its "authentic full-size suv capability." oh dear lord, are you telling me my honda suv's aren't "authentic full-size suv's"?! so from now on everytime i drive into the "suv-zone" (aka those mountains and canyons that 99.999999% of suv owners have never seen in their lives), my suv will switch to autopilot and turn me back because i'm not driving a FUCKING AUTHENTIC SUV.   to round out the shit, what about those commercials where so-and-so truck the size of canada goes deep into forbidding forests or pulls some gonzo-sized trailers or powerfully plows through dirt roads like they were roads ... without ... dirt. (damn that's so hard for an average 3000-pound car to do.) aren't suv's so awe-inspiring, reaffirming your wavering faith in the power of machines to run over animals? however, whenever you interview the typical suv owner, what is it about their precious hunk of scrap metal do they praise so lustfully? "it's soo big! i can fit all my kids and groceries and three-boob blow-up dolls!" shit, because you know, a minivan with 8 more miles to the gallon totally cramps your style. "it's so tall, i feel sooo secure!" yeah, that 7 foot, 4500-pound v-8 really keeps the accents and corrolas of the world safer at night. "it's such a good value for all its space and strength!" that's right, a cozy $10,000 profit margin for avaricious suv-makers won't stop me from saving money on my explorer, no sir!   so to every jerkoff i mentioned in this little rant (yes you too, zz top), i say graciously...go slap yourselves in the uvula, idiots.  edit 9:31 PM: haha, something rather apropos to the subject matter...   urlLink

         "ugly play"?! what the hell are those assholes at yahoo sports thinking. how was detroit's hard-fought eastern conference finals victory over indiana deserving of the demeaning moniker "ugly play"?! i was way more into their game 6 than i ever felt in the western finals, because it was a given that la would pound minnesota into a shriveling heap of old-growth trees.   anyway, the  urlLink nba finals  have arrived. this has a lot more buzz and excitement than san antonio vs. detroit to be sure. given, i really wanted reggie miller to have another taste at the gold, but detroit is easily the best team to play the lakers right now. you have la's flashy, speedy triangle offense versus detroit's physical, imposing interior presence on defense. which immovable force will be conquered next week?   backcourt: we all knew rip hamilton was a great mid-range shooter, but now he's shown a desire to carry the team with his deft slashing through the paint and a newfound 3-point touch. in comparison, chauncey billups has been relegated to taking bad 3-point looks and walking the ball upcourt. but with the pressure of the finals and the prospect of facing aging gary payton, i believe chauncey will awake and outplay the glove with key passes and clutch shots. kobe bryant is still easily more gifted than rip, but he needs to fix his shot selection. badly.   frontcourt: tayshaun prince owns devean george/rick fox. he's a rare center-like defensive presence at the 3, with his 7'2" (?!) wingspan and limitless hustle. his length frees rasheed and ben wallace to roam outside the paint, either to keep shaquille o'neal out of his comfort zone or to pressure kobe bryant. with help, ben will give shaq fits and run out his patience. rasheed will keep karl malone guessing with his own physical play, plus the inside-outside versatility that annoys post-up defenders like malone.  prediction: detroit in 7, but not confidently. they're younger and hungrier, but los angeles has oodles of experience...and we haven't seen kobe bryant really "on" in a while.   [+] smarty jones may have done quite well to capture the kentucky derby and preakness stakes, but unless he wins the grueling  urlLink belmont stakes  on saturday (the longest of the triple crown races at 1.5 miles), he is just another two-hit wonder. over the 5 years, the same horse won the first two legs to fall short at the belmont 3? times, so it's a rather common feat. and smarty's romp at preakness seemed to be due more to mediocrity in the field than actual speed. but if he could win that  urlLink triple crown ...wow, that would be something.   [+] why do the  urlLink olympics  mean so little to nba players nowadays? given, a lot of players have credible reasons to ditch (t-mac getting married, ray allen having a baby, kobe's court problems). besides that, maybe it's the need for recuperation after a grueling season (especially players that went deep into the playoffs). maybe it's the security dangers at athens, as jermaine o'neal  urlLink cites . maybe it's the fear of a poor showing, like the notorious  urlLink 6th place finish  at the 2002 world championships. maybe it's just a lack of respect for the privilege to represent their country for free, when they could be making so much more money restructuring contracts and negotiating trades.   whatever the case may be, let us hope that mike bibby (wavering), stephon marbury, allen iverson (ugh), lebron james, richard jefferson, shawn marion (eh), amare stoudemire (eh), tim duncan and jermaine o'neal (wavering) can bring pride to  urlLink usa basketball  again.

        definitely a smarmy political gesture to give  urlLink barack obama , a 42-year-old black democratic nominee for the senatorial vacancy in illinois ( urlLink jack ryan , blah blah), the  urlLink keynote speech  at the democratic convention, and he did offer some formulaic commendations of john kerry and his mop of hair that democrats like to claim is his decisiveness. (well, little do you all know that john kerry's decisiveness(tm) just dropped two weeks ago, and i already copped myself some. it's selling like hotcakes on the ebay underground, you know how we do. and hey, i'm feeling kinda presidenti -- oh, whew, it passed. must have been that time of the month. word.)  but anyway, here's an excerpt of his speech that i think every teenager, prospective voter, european, arab, muslim, and peta official should read:   we are connected as one people. if there's a child on the south side of chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. if there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. if there's an arab-american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. it's that fundamental belief -- i am my brother's keeper, i am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work. it's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single american family. "e pluribus unum." out of many, one.   yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. well, i say to them tonight, there's not a liberal america and a conservative america -- there's the united states of america. there's not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america -- there's the united states of america.   the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for republicans, blue states for democrats. but i've got news for them, too. we worship an awesome god in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it. we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the united states of america.

       (when the inspiration rains, it pours.)  i was meandering my way through the hub today to go buy  the legend of zelda: collector's edition  for gamecube (a very sexy disc, if you haven't heard about it) when i saw a hot pink manila folder lying on the ground in front of mcdonald's with a football-shaped sticker reading "for your eyes only. and by eyes i mean sex." so immediately i knew it was a letter from john kerry to john edwards.  of course, i had my doubts in opening the packet and sullying such a sacrosanct selection of sanctimonious sex-soaked socialistic shit. but then i remembered that i made this whole story up so i decided to read it. of course it turned out to be none other than a rough draft of kerry's upcoming speech to the democratic national convention in boston next week.  goody goody,  i whispered to myself greedily.  the precious ... is mine.    good evening, my fellow elitist high-brow upper-class aristocratic ketchup-loving democr -- i mean americans. and thank you, fellow playgirl playma -- i mean president clinton, for that rousing rendition of "i'm a slave 4 u." it is my sincere honor, and one of the greatest dreams in my life, to fulfill this goal of being formally named the democratic nominee for president in a ceremony that means absolutely nothing. it's almost as great a lie as the fact i've spent billions of dollars bashing my opponent on tv ads while claiming i've run a positive campaign. by the way, isn't it great that i can make my obligatory appearance at the naacp conference and spew out baseless implications that my opponent is a racist?  madeleine albright! hey baby, how  you  been!  sorry about that. anyway, it feels good to be standing here in front of a receptive audience of about one-thirtieth of the american population, and i'm sure you are all hanging on every word leaking out of my boring-ass mouth. but tonight, i will be truly honest with you all. even you, john. i love you darling! oh, shit, you too teresa. i swore i wouldn't forget you. what?! FINE, yes, we'll have sex now. *proceeds with the most boring copulation ever witnessed on live public television* al gore, eat your heart out!  now, back to the matter at hand. i would like to take this worldwide stage, this bully pulpit, to announce to you all that i am, indeed, a girly-man.  yes, i know. hell of a shock to you all, isn't it. this coming from a man who came back from vietnam with nine combat medals, and proceeded to throw them all away. this coming from a man who has less personality than a three-toed sloth. this coming from a man who misses 75% of the vote in the senate, and out of the votes he does attend, half of those simply repeal the other half. this coming from a man who gets interviewed by espn the magazine about sports and still manages to talk about vietnam every other sentence. vietnam! this from a man who vietnam. i still love you, john. are we still down for singles' night on saturday? yes? whew. close one.   but, my fellow americans, i have to lay my soul bare to you all. yes, i am a girly-man. just like my good friends in the california state senate, who couldn't make a budget on time if they stood on a giant watch. just like the distinguished press corps across the west coast, whose only headlines consist of what an atrocious hypocrite that governor arnold schwarzenegger is to be a republican in california. just like ass-backward feminist groups who complain his derogatory label is the beginning of a vast right-wing conspiracy to instill homophobia in all americans and verbally grope every woman in the pacific time zone. oh, please, grope me ah-nold! why aren't you all laughing?   now, the obvious question pervading every nook and cranny of your psyche is, why the hell would i vote for you, girly-man? dammit, too much honesty again. erm, i meant your question was, why do i consider myself a girly-man? for one thing, i am john edwards' bitch. yes, to confirm rumors, the trunks in each of my 253 limousines have enough space for our miscreant liaisons. and believe me, we  do  need a lot of space, hee hee. no ... pants tightening ... must think ... unattractive ... rosie o'donnell's thighs ... ah, better. but on the other hand, i just feel in the past few months i haven't been a forthcoming "prospective candidate" for the democratic ticket. i've pretended john edwards isn't a vapidly smiling sue-happy buffoon. i've pretended i didn't marry my wife for her gazillions of dollars of net worth. i've pretended to wholly change my lame-ass personality when i'm still able to make chris tucker fall asleep.   in short, my fellow americans, i've lied to you all in the past, and i desire to repent for my egregiously sacriligious sins. so i hope that you will all come together with the kerry-heinz family -- and everybody in the democratic party who hasn't popped a vein while imitating howard dean -- to pray for penitence from my holy father, the token black voting bloc. thank you all, and may god bless america, but especially african-americans 18 and older.

          YES I WISH I MISSED IT. DON'T MAKE ME LOOK AT THAT PICTURE AGAIN. IT BURNS. LIKE FIRE. FUSED INTO THE NUCLEUS OF A TRITIUM ATOM. WHICH IS THEREUPON LIT INTO ITS OWN TOWERING FLAMING INFERNO. HOPEFULLY WITH TIM KAWAKAMI AND SKIP BAYLESS'S SMOLDERING BODIES INSIDE. MMMM. I MEAN, OWWW. IT BURNS.  erm, well here i am, in july of 2004, a little over three months from the start of the new nba season and two weeks from an all-nba third-team destruction derby that i like to call the olympics, and already i am energized, hungrily anticipatory, and just generally jacked for some yummy roundball action. not to mention completely, albeit ambivalently, devastated to what has happened to my precious orlando magic, my first and only true basketball love.  in the span of about oh, a month give or take, the young, raw, but highly potent young group of individuals that comprised the core of what was once south florida's premier nba franchise was utterly dismantled ... and for what? a ball-hogging wannabe point guard, an undersized slasher, an often-lethargic looking long-range specialist, a defensive stopper allergic to scoring, and a passive shot-blocker.   thank god for john weisbrod.   crap move #1: throwing away zaza pachulia to the wolves/bobcats/bucks.   the unrealized talent of this young man from georgia (the country), who with practice had the potential to be a great post-up threat with good hands, was simply tossed by the wayside with just about no compensation. just around what we figured when pachulia started bringing his la-z-boy to the bench for naps while steven hunter turned the ball over three times a minute and andrew declercq fouled out three times a minute.   crap move #2: you know god-damn-fucking what.   WHY. WHY. WHY DID FUCKING JOHN WEISBROD THINK HE COULD PUSH TRACY MCGRADY AROUND AND TELL HIM HE WASN'T WANTED AND THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS HOMETOWN. general manager john weisbrod can think he's a great personnel manager, having spent roughly a decade managing some no-name hockey team, but he's never dealt with an absolute talent like t-mac. and as my fellow weisbrod-whipper  urlLink kilgore t. schutz  (lovely name) loves to point out, YOU DON'T TREAT YOUR FRANCHISE PLAYER LIKE SHIT. you see jerry buss in los angeles taking off his pants and bending over just right for kobe bryant and his 7-year maximum contract, and then you see JOHN FUCKING WEISBROD. anyway, orlando loses t-mac, tyronn lue (aka the man with more technical fouls than assists), and juwan howard (aka the man who magically learns how to shoot in the fourth quarter). and what do we get? steve francis (aka "the franchise," aka a bald allen iverson with no steals), cuttino mobley (in short, he's short), and kelvin cato (a man who would rather get an inlay than an inlet pass).   crap move #3: trading away drew gooden for tony battie.   first, the sidenotes: dumping steven hunter on the cavaliers' doorstep is good. the ONLY good. now, giving away our athletic second-round pick anderson varejao (who had an interesting upside) is stupid. getting two future second-round picks (in 2005 and 2007) from a future contender in cleveland (meaning they will be late picks) is stupid. AND GIVING AWAY DREW GOODEN IS REALLY AMAZINGLY STUPID. mmm, caps lock. this means that in the end, we traded t-mac's good friend mike miller and got deshawn stevenson and tony battie in return. WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT. stevenson still can't shoot ... wait a second ... neither can battie. but it's ok because, in the immortal john weisbrod's words, tony battie "is a super high character guy." not just high, but super high. great. who cares if we picked up a guy who can't really ball worth shit as long as he's loyal and won't bitch when johnny davis again screws orlando in the asshole like he did with philadelphia.  i just hope orlando finds a way to be good. but until then -- for me at least --there's always t-mac. in houston. till the "end [of his] career." NOOOOOOOOOO

's "soft hands" (as seen above). and newsweek calls itself a  reputed media outlet . allow me to shoot myself repeatedly in my groin region. or foot, whichever is higher. wait ... ah shit.   i hope the prospective voters of this country (all 24 of them) have already realized that the demos' whole buddy buddy&nbsp;appearance is the foundation of a calculated image overhaul&nbsp;which has no roots in a place i'd like to call honesty. please do not tell me it is mere coincidence that greedy lawyer/happy plant man edwards&nbsp;swoops onto the ticket and suddenly al gore jr himself turns into some giggling lovey-dovey teletubby. and boy, isn't it great that they've become such a "good couple," as declared a gleeful john rupaul kerry? the newsweek&nbsp;story even cites a statement from a bush aide agreeing that their families are photogenic. WHO GIVES A RAT'S FUCK. obviously i do, because i realize how important elizabeth edwards is in saving our country from terrorism.   furthermore, newsweek editor mark whitaker loudly berates the "predominantly (and expensively) negative [campaign], targeting people's fears of more terror than their hopes for a better future." all the while nonchalantly IGNORING  urlLink kerry's expensively negative campaign . what the hell gives newsweek the right to determine which "news" is worth telling to subscribers. oh, AND&nbsp;THEY COMPLAIN&nbsp;ABOUT THE "BUSH ECONOMY." the economy wobbled and eventually started to  urlLink tumble  during the end of the clinton presidency, which wasn't really clinton's OR bush's fault. alan greenspan just  urlLink raised  interest rates last week. 112,000 new jobs were added these last six months alone. bush fucking economy my ass.   haha this blog is now turning into my closed-minded weapon of 1337 propagandra p0w3r.   segwaying away from  urlLink frivolous lawsuit man  john edwards (sorry, best transition i could pull off), we have actual  urlLink frivolous lawsuits . not too much i will say about it, except that i don't think people sue about  urlLink not being class valedictorian  in  urlLink sudan  very much.

       sorry caroline, my response to your  urlLink post  ran a little long. if you don't feel like reading her post, the jist of it is that while asian parents incur much of the blame for turning their kids into unit-infested ap-breathing encyclopedic zombies, part of the cause is the competitive nature of the kids themselves.  to a certain point this trend is due to our damnably demanding demeanor of our dear dads ... and moms ... because standards of living in america are so much more relaxed than those in mother russia. why else are so many asian kids all over the nation in ap/honors classes in the first place? and an ap test (no matter how blatantly overpriced they are) is a lot cheaper than a comparable college course.   however, the idea that self-motivated kids are bringing these circumstances upon themselves is true as well. it starts at childhood, when our parents shuffle us into gate and we're too young to complain or even not enjoy it. little kids generally love to flaunt their superlatives, be it athletic or academic, because modesty isn't instinctual. obviously this mindset carries on through secondary school -- since you have the mental capacity for stronger coursework, why not challenge yourself? ultimately, you are the one writing "ap" on your schedule requests, not your parents.  i would like to think all kids, regardless of background, realize that it is a disservice to not take advantage of higher learning opportunities when they're offered so freely, what with their college texts and "advanced" (depending on the teacher) learning techniques. it sets a bad precedent to settle for cp courses, because you're essentially permitting yourself to give up, to not rise to your full potential in that specific endeavor. so obviously i'm saying that you should. it's noble -- or at least respectable -- to follow and fulfill any passion to its end, and school should be no different.   what i'm saying is, whatever challenges you decide to take on in life, don't half-ass them. (this doesn't deserve a line break but it looks cool.)

       selecting this incident as an example for my rant today may strike some as insensitive, but it does fit into what i'm trying to relate. yes, because i said so. now, this story from the  urlLink sj mercury  (subscription required) describes an interview with "jefferson and catherine silveira, the san jose couple who lost a child [last] sunday while trying to help a stray dog off a freeway." i could finish off my post by calling them irrational stupidheads for grossly endangering the lives of their children by the "heroic" stunt they pulled (described below), but i'm not sexy enough for that.  the couple was driving with their four children, as the article elaborates: "they spotted [the dog] running alongside highway 85 on fourth of july evening. ... [catherine] flipped on her hazard lights, swung over to the shoulder (not completely, apparently, which brings me to My Note(tm): idiot), and slowed down while [jefferson] leaned out the passenger side window and tried to shoo the dog off the highway." then, what do you expect on highway fucking 85 but "a turquoise speck in her rear-view mirror ... 'coming like a bullet.'" thankfully, the baby oceana escaped unharmed, but 6-year old catarina suffered a broken leg, 7-year old jefferson III incurred multiple fractures, and 12-year old tomas was killed. this ultimately is a meaningless gesture that will never be seen by anyone who's connected to this, but i offer my condolences for their loss and pain. however, i am not pete wilson, so let there be uneducated opinion.  perhaps they were simply egged along my the newspaper's reporter to share their story to the community, and they truly did not wish to capitalize on the incident. yet, i nonetheless cite this event as an implication of the selfish mindset of many americans during tragic events -- the impulse to grab their undeserved 15 minutes of fame and hog whatever insignificant wattage of spotlight they can muster for themselves. why is it that when somebody dies in an egregious manner, be it by murder or automobile accident or whatever, that their  survivors  feel this is an excuse to get their name on the front page of the local section? in essence they are using the suffering of others for their own self-indulgence, and it is wrong. it is undeserved fame. and if you look at the root of this specific sin, it has spread across our society like a plague.   slave reparations. (aka fucktard topic #1) reality television. class-action lawsuits. (aka fucktard topic #2) affirmative action. (aka fucktard topic #3) hell, even welfare is a relevant example of this "free lunch" mentality that so many people share. dammit, people have to deserve what they earn. all people at their core can be strong, intelligent, independent individuals. there are so many kids living in the "ghettoes" of society who are living full lives, supporting their families, gaining knowledge (for themselves, if not the report card), and expressing their artistry (graffiti art, bboying, freestyling, etc.), even as they are pigeonholed into the stereotype of ignorant, intolerant, unmotivated adolescents.   i would bet you my life (no, not really) that this american way of thinking will never change -- we as a society glorify individualism to a nigh-unhealthy degree. (yes! a way to transition into calling michael moore a sanctimonious asshole without having to create another pointless, rambling post!) the status quo will for evermore remain the status fucking quo. but it would clear my mind just a bit if these americans could realize that you don't need to be quoted in the 6 o'clock news to validate your existence.

       today i wanted to watch spider-man 2 with my dad and brother at union landing, when, out of nowhere, i ran into none other than president bush. you could probably guess my reaction to this strange convergence of our souls -- apathy, disinterest, with perhaps a pinch of boredom -- but still, i had wanted to meet him for a long time, just to see how he was handling the press's unwarranted disfiguration of his nonexistent reputation.  "hi, ryan!" he greeted me cheerily. "good to see you."  "wha...how the hell do you know my name, sir?" i stared, flabbergasted, at the man who couldn't distinguish iyad allawi from sabiha ali. (i know! isn't it hella sad that  our president , the most powerful man in the world besides dick cheney and prince, can't tell them apart? it's almost like saying muhammad ali and cassius clay are the same person. i mean, c'mon now.)  "oh, you know, just snooping around in my fbi files regarding you, using my patriot act-bequeathed powers of ultimate dictatorship +3/+3 to find out the handles your acquaintances label you with at no less than 23 different locations, and corroborating them with a minimum of 5 separate pieces of identification to deduce that yes, you watch wrestling." he then took out one of those nokia walkie-talkies: "john, did i say that right?"  "no, it's 'pittsburgh paper.'"  i was scared anyway. "OH GOD NO I SWEAR ON THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY IF YOU DON'T TELL ANYBODY I'LL MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT WMD IN IRAQ AND AL QAEDA-SADDAM LINKS TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!"  "really!?!!" you've never lived if you haven't seen george walker bush jump 10 feet in the air and click his heels, especially when these heels are hanging off his genitalia. "oh boy oh boy oh boy. i can't even spell 'oile' correctly, i'm so excited. wait, i can never spell 'oile' correctly. shit."  "alright mr. president, how does this sound? 'boy claims famed terrorist saddam hussein in deep cahoots with al qaeda, president bush relieved that somebody else besides paul believes him.'"  he was understandably pleased. "WOW! thank you! that's the best headline i've ever heard since 't-mac traded to houston, editors too distraught to make anti-bush propaganda.' i'm so happy! wait a minute..."  "fine fine, i was just playing witchoo, knaamean cheeleecheezhawtdawg?" i knew those ebonics classes would save my life someday. "''boy claims famed terrorist saddam hussein in deep cahoots with al qaeda to steal oil, president bush relieved that somebody else besides paul believes him.'"  "it's 'oile,' dumbass," he said smugly. "i went to yale, you know. got a 2.0, but that's just between us. wait, OILE!! THEY STOLE OUR -- ER THE IRAQIS' -- OILE?! OH GOD! i'm sorry, dad! i failed you. i lost your oile and your saddam to that damn iraqi puppet court forever. CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME FOR NOT SUCCESSFULLY PERPETUATING OUR CLANDESTINE SELFISH AGENDA OF IMPOSING ECONOMIC STRANGLEHOLDS ON FOREIGN NATIONS TO TEMPORARILY FULFILL THE WASTEFUL DESIRES OF THE IGNORANT AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL UNDER THE RIDICULOUSLY MISLEADING GUISE OF TRYING TO RID THE WORLD OF TERRORISM AND NEEDLESS DEATH?"   it's strange to see grown men fall on their knees and blubber like overgrown babies, especially when they still have shoes hanging on their genitalia.

        urlLink    i was waiting at the docks at jack london square for the tenth time in my life to watch fireworks, when all of a sudden this unkempt-looking woman with a large front tooth shoves her way next to me and tries to strike conversation. and oh god no, i smell bad champagne...she's drunk. fuck.  "hi, do you come here often?" she says cheerily.  "no, we only come to see the fireworks." damn, i want her to go away.  "well, i come here a lot, but i haven't the last two years because i'm a lazy bum. i hope the fireworks are good this year though. i've been to san francisco, those are some nice fireworks. it's usually windy though."  i stand there, give her a benign smile while making as little eye contact as humanly possible, and hope she stops talking. BUT SHE DOESN'T.  "have you seen the fireworks at san francisco? blah blah annoying windy blah blah yadda shut up don't you hate when i keep talking to you when i'm obviously aggravating the shit out of you and you don't want to listen to me waste oxygen by spouting my ignorant, self-serving remarks, but i have absolutely no sense of propriety and i keep on continuing aforementioned one-sided discussion because i'm an asshole who doesn't represent anybody from american high school that doesn't think the all-consuming purgatory that is my godawful cacophonous voice is worse than being castrated with a safety pin?"  "no, of course not. you know, people like you are my favorite in the whole wide world."
