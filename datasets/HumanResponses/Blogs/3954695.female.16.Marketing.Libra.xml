       Just take it , take it.   Can't take it , take it.    &nbsp;  I know what you do , flash me.   The way it's done , impolitely.   Just trying to find &nbsp;some alone time.   No room to compromise.    &nbsp;  Just take it , take it.   Can't take it , take it.   So sell you picture to a magazine.   Invasions aren't true photography.   Is that what you always wanted to be ?    Well I'd be worried for you .   Sometimes , gotta try.   Run and hide , get away from this.   I'll get by ,in this life , this time.    &nbsp;  Take your best shot , and press me .   Write a fictional story , for your feed.   Try to get the world ,to believe.   Shocking headline surprise.    &nbsp;  Just take it , take it.   Can't take it , take it.   So sell you picture to a magazine.  Invasions aren't true photography.  Is that what you always wanted to be ?  Well I'd be worried for you .  Sometimes , gotta try.  Run and hide , get away from this.  I'll get by ,in this life , this time.    &nbsp;  You see me ,I see you.   You're over there .   You see me , I see you.    &nbsp;  So sell you picture to a magazine.  Invasions aren't true photography.  Is that what you always wanted to be ?  Well I'd be sorry for you.   Sometimes&nbsp;, gotta try .   Run and hide , get away from shit.    &nbsp;  Sometimes , gotta try,   Run and hide , get away from this...&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;

       So much for my happy ending   So much for my happy ending    &nbsp;  Let's talk this over   It's not like we're dead   Was it something I did ?    Was it something you said ?   Don't leave me hangin'   In a city so dead   Held up so high   On such a breakable thread    &nbsp;  Pre-Chorus   You were all the things I thought I knew   And I thought we could be    &nbsp;  Chorus   You were everything, everything   That I wanted   We were meant to be , supposed to be   But we lost it   All of our memories so close to me   Just fade away   All this time you were pretending   So much for my happy ending   So much for my happy ending    &nbsp;  You've got your dumb friends   I know what they say   They tell you I'm difficult   But so are they   But they don't know me   Do they even know you ?   All the things you hide from me   All the shit that you do    &nbsp;  Pre-chorus    &nbsp;  Chorus    &nbsp;  It's nice to know taht you were there   Thanks for acting like you care   And making me feel like I was the only one   It's nice to know we had it all   Thanks for watching as I fall   And letting me know we were done    &nbsp;  Chorus (2x)    &nbsp;  So much for my happy ending   So much for my happy ending
