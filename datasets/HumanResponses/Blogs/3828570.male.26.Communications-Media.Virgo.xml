      I got an email from Randy (Kevin's manager) today...Hallelujah is done! The studio work was done yesterday, and the mixing today, so by mid-next week, I should have the recording in my hands.  For those not up to speed, I've been working with Kevin Max ( urlLink website ) to record a cover of Leonard Cohen's song  Hallelujah  to use over the end credits of my upcoming short film,  Habeas Corpus .  Stay tuned, and I'll keep you posted on our progress.  We're going to be putting together a little promotional teaser soon, so I'll let you know when that's done.

      I watched a hilarious film today... The Work and the Story , a "mockumentary" about small town Mormon filmmakers and the search for the next "Mormon Spielberg."  Coming from a Fundamentalist background myself, one of my favorite parts was a cutaway to a short film (very short...about 8-9 seconds), called "A Good Boy Doesn't Do That."  It's just a shot of a boy, and an offscreen woman's voice says, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"  The boy looks up and says, "I want to make movies!"  And then a hand comes in and slaps him.  Freeze frame. The End.  Check it out...  The  urlLink IMDb page

      I got a kick out of this...from IMDb's  urlLink news page...    Hollywood actor Benjamin Bratt suffered the ultimate embarrassment when he agreed to surprise a fan on Oprah Winfrey's chat show - she had no idea who he was. Bratt was initially happy to go along with making his alleged admirer's day, but once the two met he quickly learned that a big mistake had been made somewhere along the line.   He recalls, "There was the story of an aunt who had written in to the show saying that her niece is a huge Benjamin Bratt fan and she was disappointed because she couldn't get tickets for the show. So the producers of the show wanted to surprise her. They called her down to a spa in downtown Chicago and they told her that she was going to be the recipient of a massage and a facial, etc. Well, the gag was for me to show up with a bouquet of flowers and walk out to the lobby where she was sitting and say, as I did, 'Hi, I'm Benjamin Bratt, I'm going to be your masseur for the day!' She just looked up at me and went, 'Okay...' She had no idea who I was! The aunt got the niece to show up at the spa and she had no idea who I was, so needless to say, it was footage that was completely unusable. It was incredibly humbling."

      I'm thinking about doing a remake of this classic 1950 film-noir feature....it opens with a man walking into a police station and saying, "I want to report a murder."  "Who is the victim?" they ask.  The man answers, "I am."  He's been poisoned, and has only 24 hours left to find his killer.  You can actually download the original version of the film  urlLink here.   (It's now in the public domain.)  The D.O.A.  urlLink  IMDb page.

      During an intense high wind/rain/hail storm last week, I was at home, talking to my wife on the phone.  I said, "this thunder is so loud it's shaking the house!"  Ten mintues later I called her back and said, "actually, that wasn't thunder."  Yes, friends, a tree fell on our house, with me and the kids inside.  Here are the photos.  (Caution treehuggers....these may be disturbing.)        There appears to be no real damage to the house...although I think its ego may have been bruised a bit.

      I received this email today.....my response follows below.   ---------------------------------------------------    USPS New Stamp   This one is impossible to believe.. Scroll down for the text.  If there is only one thing you forward today.....let it be this!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of PanAm  Flight 103!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World  Trade Center in 1993!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine  barracks in Lebanon!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the military  barracks in Saudi Arabia!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American  Embassies in Africa!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on the Twin Towers on 9/11/2001!   REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were  lost in those vicious MUSLIM attacks!    Now the United States Postal Service REMEMBERS and HONORS the  EID MUSLIM holiday season with a commemorative first class  holiday postage stamp.   REMEMBER to adamantly and vocally BOYCOTT this stamp  when purchasing your stamps at the post office.  To use this stamp would be a slap in the face to all those  AMERICANS who died at the hands of those whom this stamp honors.   REMEMBER to pass this along to every patriotic AMERICAN you know.     ----------------------------------------------------    My response:     One could just as easily say:   --------------------------------------------------   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN Crusades in which soldiers swept over Jerusalem and slaughtered men, women and children, 'until their horses were knee deep in blood!'   REMEMBER Charlemagne, a devout CHRISTIAN who, after conquering the Saxon rebels, gave them a choice between baptism and execution. When they refused to convert, he had 4500 of them beheaded in one morning!   REMEMBER Constantine, the first Roman Emperor to become a CHRISTIAN, who had over 3000 Christians executed because their interpretation of the Bible did not agree with his!   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN Spanish Inquisition Tribunal, which ordered extermination of 3 million rebels in the Netherlands!   REMEMBER that in the 4th and 5th centuries synagogues were burned and Jews killed by CHRISTIANS!   REMEMBER the Nazis (lead by someone who claimed to be a CHRISTIAN) who exterminated millions of Jews, while other CHRISTIANS set up death camps, independently of the Nazis, and mudered about half a million victims of various backgrounds!   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN witch hunts (1484-1750), in which several hundred thousand witches (about 80% female) were burned at the stake or hanged!   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS OF THE KKK, who beat or killed numerous blacks (or those friendly to blacks), and continue to do so!   REMEMBER all the HUMAN lives that were lost in those vicious CHRISTIAN attacks!     Now the United States Postal Service REMEMBERS and HONORS the CHRISTIAN holiday season with a commemorative first class holiday postage stamp.   REMEMBER to adamantly and vocally BOYCOTT this stamp when purchasing your stamps at the post office. To use this stamp would be a slap in the face to all those MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN who died at the hands of those whom this stamp honors.   REMEMBER to pass this along to every patriotic AMERICAN you know.    --------------------------------------------------------   Now, the preceeding was said with a great deal of sarcasm (although the facts listed are unfortunately true), but hopefully, you get the point. There have been those throughout history who have acted illegitmately on behalf of various groups, comandeering their name and message, and promoting a false agenda. The Islamic Terrorists are one such group.   There are many, MANY peaceful Muslims who DESPISE what the terrorists are doing in the name of Islam. (How does it make you feel when you hear members of the White Supremacy groups attempting to justify blatant racism with Scripture?)   It is obviously fine to be anti-terrorist. It is NOT fine to be anti-Muslim. They have the right to worship peacibly, just as we do. Our ancestors fought and died to give them that right.   If you turn on your peaceful Muslim neighbors, and deny them the same freedoms that you enjoy, THEN THE TERRORISTS WILL HAVE WON.   Emails like this one frighten me, because they remind me of a time, not too long ago, when Americans were corraled into stadiums, theaters, and racetracks because of their appearance.   I have a good friend whose Grandfather, an AMERICAN CITIZEN, spent THREE YEARS in an internment camp in California. He had been a sucessful entrepreneur, but lost his business, his home, and his finances.   His ONLY crime? BEING JAPANESE.   All of this is said with much love and respect, but with a great sense of urgency.   WE MUST NOT FORGET that we are called to LOVE our enemies, to turn the other cheek, to live peacibly among all men, to forgive seventy times seven, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, etc, etc, etc.   John 13:35 - By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

      Well, maybe not quite yet.  Found this on New York Times (via Drudge) today....it's kind of scary.   Will Compasses Point South?   By WILLIAM J. BROAD  The collapse of the Earth's magnetic field, which both guards the planet and guides many of its creatures, appears to have started in earnest about 150 years ago. The field's strength has waned 10 to 15 percent, and the deterioration has accelerated of late, increasing debate over whether it portends a reversal of the lines of magnetic force that normally envelop the Earth.  During a reversal, the main field weakens, almost vanishes, then reappears with opposite polarity. Afterward, compass needles that normally point north would point south, and during the thousands of years of transition, much in the heavens and Earth would go askew.

      I directed another short film this weekend...a new one for ProjectGod.com (which will make their 9th film this year).       Here's the cast and crew at work.  I'm coaching our actresses, Jennifer and Ashley Dantzler, while Tim Searfoss, our faithful and talented DP checks the lighting.     It's not real whiskey.  I'm setting up a prop.  Really.  I promise.    This one is about the futility of hiding things from your kids...they're smarter than we give them credit for.  Our decisions will affect them in ways that we can't even imagine.    I'm in the process of editing it now, and it should be going up pretty soon.  In the meantime, check out some of the other films we've been working on.   urlLink ProjectGod.com

      No, not that kind of kid.  (Sorry Mom...not quite yet.)  I'm talking about my pets....my babies.  Here they are, in the order the stork brought them to us:     Julius Caesar - "Julius"    Mark Antony - "Tony"    TwoFace - "Twosers"    Calphurnia - "Callie"  All of these animals are rescues....and they are all absolutely wonderful creatures with amazing temperaments.    When you're ready to bring a bundle of love home, before you go to a breeder or (God forbid) a pet store, check out your local shelter.  Thousands of helpless animals are needlessly killed every day in America because someone "lost interest" in their pet and dropped them off at the pound.  Check out  urlLink Petfinder.com  for shelter listings and available animals near you.  Also, if you can't commit to a pet long term, consider "fostering" a dog or cat temporarily.  Pounds and State-run "Kill Shelters" can only hold animals for a certain number of days before putting them down.  Fostering is simply taking an animal out of a Kill Shelter and letting it stay with you while a home can be found for it.  There are so many loving homes out there, but most people just don't realize that they can make a huge difference.     "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."  - Ghandi   ------------------------------------------------------   Edit:  Tracy posted a comment, but it's too important to relegate to the comments page....so here it is:   preach it!! do you know that less than 10% of the pets given to pounds and govt run facilities are adopted??? the rest are euthanized :-( -donate ($ or pet items)to your local shelters -sponsor a foster parent -report abuse/cruelty -volunteer -adopt -foster -spread the word!!!  you can find a listing of local shelters and rescue groups on petfinder.org  these are some scheduled to be killed within the next couple days. There are literally thousands more - pure (some even with papers) and mixed breeds...    Lab Mix Puppy - 3 months old    Boxer Mix Puppy - 7 months old     Shep/Terrier Mix Puppy - 3 months old    Pointer/Dalmation Mix - adult    Terrier mix - 10 months old

      All is well with the world again.  CNN is reporting that the three leads have been announced in the new Broadway musical "Spamalot," billed as "the musical lovingly ripped off from the motion picture, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'" The lead cast consists of David Hyde Pierce as "brave" Sir Robin, Tim Curry as King Arthur, and Hank Azaria as Sir Lancelot.  The book for the new musical was written by Eric Idle (who played Sir Robin in the original film).   urlLink Come and see the link inherent in the system...

      Here are a couple of shots from Chattanooga's July 4th fireworks display on the river.  We (Chris, Paul, Jess, Tracy and I) were watching from the Walnut Street Bridge....Overall, it was a decent show, except that the finale apparently came during the middle of the show.  The end just kind of...fizzled.    The boats lining up on the river, waiting for sundown.    The view from the walking bridge.

      Of all the dissapointing news I've heard this week, this is probably the most annoying.  Apparently, the upcoming Dukes of Hazard film adaptation has been placed in the hands of the Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe, who brought us such wonderful cinematic achievments as "Super Troopers" and "Club Dread."  This won't be an adaptation, it will be a spoof.   Here's the story from  urlLink Comingsoon.net     Jay Chandrasekhar Directing Dukes of Hazard   Actor Paul Soter has announced on Broken Lizard's official Blog that writer/director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar will helm the big screen adaptation of The Dukes of Hazard.  The Warner Bros. film is based on the popular late-'70s/early-'80s CBS series. The show centered on the adventures of Southern cousins Bo, Luke and Daisy Duke, who drove around in a Dodge Charger nicknamed the General Lee as they evaded the unscrupulous Boss Hogg and Sheriff Coltrane.  Ashton Kutcher and Paul Walker previously expressed interest in starring as the fast-drivin' cousins, with Anthony Anderson as Hogg. Chandrasekhar directed Super Troopers and this year's Club Dread.    It's bad enough that Hollywood apparently has no original ideas.  Don't ruin the few good things we have left.

      I'm going to start a new (recuring) article where I post pictures taken with my groovy new little cameraphone.  These will be candid shots of friends and colleagues, images of places I go, and a few odd shots to make you scratch your head.  Here is the first edition:   The following are some pictures taken during my recent road trip to LA.       The open road...    The famous Pyramid Arena in Memphis....    St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital....a very special place to my family.    A shot of the Arkansas sky...    Coming and Going    Welcome to Texas    I came across this leaning water tower in Britten, TX.  Apparently it's a local landmark.    Welcome to New Mexico    There are still a lot of trains in the desert...    Welcome to Arizona    This truck had just overturned as I drove up.  The high winds blew it right into the ditch.  (The driver was up and walking around.)    According to the billboard, this is the largest cross in the Western Hemisphere.  I have to say, it freaked me out a little bit as I saw it getting bigger on the horizon.  (Those little dots are people walking around the base of it.)

      Right now I'm working on this great book called "Memo from David O. Selznick," which I picked up at McKay's, our local used bookstore, for about $2.00.   It is a chronological collection of memos, letters, and notes written by Selznick (who produced Gone with the Wind, among hundreds of other studio pictures during the Golden Years of Hollywood.) It follows him as he bounced from MGM to Paramount to RKO (and back to MGM) etc etc.   One of the most interesting stories (told in his own words) is when he left Paramount to form an independent production company (remember, this was during the heyday of "assembly line" filmmaking...everyone involved in a picture was under contract to the studio...so the idea of an independent company was unheard of....DOS was way ahead of his time.)   So his father-in-law was Louis B. Mayer of MGM (Selznick had just married Irene Mayer). Mayer called a meeting of studio execs and instructed them NOT to deal with Selznick's new company, because if they did, every two-bit writer and director would try to weasel out of their studio contracts and start their own indie companies....collapsing the whole studio system.   And this was the poor guy's father-in-law!   Anyway...if you're interested in film history....particularly the early days...check out this book...it's like sitting in Selznick's office, looking over his shoulder.

      As you will no doubt have heard by the time you read this, we lost one of the greatest actors of the 20th Century today.     "On the Waterfront" is one of my favorite films, due in large part to Brando's unusual acting choices.  The famous "coulda been a condentah" scene in particular comes to mind.  The way he responded to having his own brother pull a gun on him...no anger...just sadness.  Genius.  The sad irony is that he never thought of his own work as being anything special....Corleone, Kowalski, Malloy, Kurtz....he never recognized that these were his masterpieces.  He once said about Stanley Kowalski, his character in "A Streetcar Named Desire,"   "Kowalski was always right, and never afraid. He never wondered, he never doubted. His ego was very secure. And he had the kind of brutal agressiveness that I hate. I'm afraid of it. I detest the character."     urlLink Brando's IMDb Page

      A brand new (and quite glowing) review of my short film,  Outcasts , was just published online.   urlLink Link   Here are a couple of excerpts:   To my delight,  the film works in its simplicity—it is intelligently made,  thoughtfully written, and it successfully updates Christ’s  brief parable of the Good Samaritan. I think the carpenter from  Nazareth would have been proud at how well Boatright translates  what is arguably his most famous parable. ...  With Outcasts, Boatright reveals himself to be a talented  artist with a message. He has made a short, to-the-point film  that will certainly challenge Christians to think outside of  the comfort zones, as well as let the rest of the world know  that not all Christians are as over-zealous as some of the characters  featured in this film. The film is so effective in its simplicity,  I am left with no doubt that If Christ had come today, he would  have directed short films.

      Hello all...this is just a random update to let you know some of what's going on:  First, we've started post production on Sinners and You, and from what I can tell, it's going to be a hilarious film.  Pictures are still forthcoming....  Second, we're looking into having a local short film night here in Chattanooga at a great new coffeeshop/internet cafe called Cafe Aroma.  It's a Christian-owned cafe (and we want to make this kid-friendly), so we're looking for relatively wholesome content, but we will be taking submissions from the public.  Email me if you're interested.  Third, Jamie Watts and I have started developing the story for the "As of Yet Untitled DOA Remake", which will most likely be BBP's first feature.  We're keeping many details under wraps, but we can tell you that we're looking at setting the film in Savannah, Ga.  Fourth, we've been invited to submit some of our work to the first annual Firefly Film Festival (Oct 1, 2004), hosted by the University of Tennessee here in Chattanooga.  In addition to Outcasts, we plan on sending Sinners and You, which means it will probably be its first public viewing.  The venue will be Club Fathom on Market Street, so if you're in the area, make plans to come by.  Finally,  this weekend ProjectGod.com will be releasing my most recent directorial work...a short film called "Heredity."  Be sure to swing by the site and check it out.  That's it for now....stay tuned for more.  (Also...I've added a few new links to the right...check em' out.)

      This week we shot yet another original production from the Beamish Boy, a satirical spoof called  Sinners and You .  Using the most scientific time tested propaganda devices, the film explains how to clearly identify and avoid "Sinners"....which are, unfortunately, a menace that exists all around us.  SnY was written by Justin Tarlton and directed by Chris Bookless.  Post production is beginning now, and the film should be festival ready within a month.  We'll have pictures shortly.
