      It was a pretty good weekend overall. Friday night, I saw the new Harry Potter movie.  It was incredibly good.  Some of the pieces were a little too Hollywood, but I suppose that's the way the book was written as well.  Saturday night I washed my truck and got it SPARKLING, got a haircut and the went to The Side Bar.  It was a great time and I met a girl names Melissa.  She's really cool and looks great in an Opeth T-shirt.  Wow.  What a body.  Sunday I just messed around with music stuff, did some recording, and went to the driving range.  I'm pretty happy today because the weekend was fun.  I haven't had that much fun on a weekend in a while.  W

      The sky was gray on the way to work today It was easy on the eyes And though I didn't have to squint I prefer the bluer skies  The air was cool on the way to work today It was agreeable once again I wasn't chilled and I wasn't sweating but I prefer to feel my skin

      Once again at work, trying to keep busy by finding stuff to do.  Reading "drudge" while istening to talk radio is quite depressing. I'm amazed at the way things are written in the papers with obvious bias.  I really hope people don't take these stories at face value.  -------------- All of My Life -------------- All of my life I've tried  to right the wrongs  I've spied the tide of lies don't even try to deny  me this right for I I will fight to keep the truth in the light  All of my days I'd gaze in ways I've known to erase the malaise no delays in the frays in the haze in a daze i'm amazed i've been lost in this maze  I'm not sure what to do I couldn't see in the morning But now it's Thursday afternoon and I hope by the evening I'll know what we need to do.

      Today I woke up late.  I was kind of in a rush, but not really.  I knew I didn't have anything to important or exciting to tend to here at work.  I stayed up pretty late watching "The Wild Bunch" and I still got a really good night of sleep. ---------------------------------------------------------- This is how I feel... I'll probably turn this into a song. ----------------------------------------------------------  i've got this feeling welling up inside of me kind of like a heavy blanket wrapped around my heart unable to break free  to the fresh surface air  i wish my spirit were blithe and for that i strive because a lot of the time  i don't quite feel alive  especially when i sit and stare at a screen which offers me absolutely nothing except the green to which i'm a slave.  so free me, change my life somehow save me, i need to break the chains break free, i need to work toward being free set free, eliminate the things that enslave me
