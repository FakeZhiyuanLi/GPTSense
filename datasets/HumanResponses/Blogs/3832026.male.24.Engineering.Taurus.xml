      Overslept today.... woke up at 0630, take a quick shower and reach camp at 0745. Whole day was sitting in the office still not doing much.. i refuses to do anything...except maybe for my beloved handing/taking over report. Was initially against the idea of doing juz a report, after all i'm juz a small fry, kind of stupid. But then again, i decided to do a extremely detail one which inculdes all my job-scope and a step by step idiots guide to doing my job.   Well..... went to chong pang wif sam & yuanjing this afternoon for lunch. Feel abit guilty coz i'm always critisting the&nbsp;those who always&nbsp;go out of camp to lunch. But hey... i'm going to ord.. so who cares... ord rulz...haahaa...  These few day, ariff is really aiming me to help out in the orientation of the new drivers. He send an email to everyone but me, saying he wants me in for orientation as he feels jeremy is really to take over and that he need the sect comd for LRI check. Much to my surprise, yuanjing shown me the mail & reply that he does not wants me to go for orientation and that I'm already clearing my offs/leave. Was rather happy he finally made a stand. First time he actually protected his own assistant. In the end, the small boy made the final decision that I'll will not go for orientation. Ariff doesn't seems to give up, bump into him at the loading this morning and he starts asking me abt details of my off and my actual ord date... I juz mumble something abt ording next month &amp; disappear...haa...  I really dunno what's wrong with my neck.. it's still soo stiff and i juz cannot bend my head. It really very disprutive to my daily life...&nbsp;I've changed my sleeping position and i even apply those muscle rub...nothing seems to work... arrgh...

      Spend the day lazing ard... playing games as usual, got a phone call frm maurice. Dunno why he keeps asking me to go his house 2 play a computer game... i wonder what kind of kind is it... Anyway met up wif him at bukit panjang plaza juz now. He keeps going for details these past few weeks due to shortage of drivers at his place... haa... Well, he's involved in this Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) business & he wants me to join him. Spend an hour plus trying to explain 2 me the concept &amp; how it can be a career. Well, somehow i'm juz dun find it feasible. Part-time..yes, full time job... no way....  Today further strengthens my belives that i'm going to be transported back in time... 2 years back before NS. My mum is starting his nagging all over again. Shes keeps nagging at my health. Somehow I got the impression that she thinks her son is very weak. This really angers me... I'm begining to think that's the reason why i didn't choose to stay out even when i had the chance... Geez... she keeps treating me like a child... I'm already 23 for goodness sake......

      Back at coy line again today.... well guess what... i really dunno what's OC or csm is thinking... they've got themselve another ops spec asst... so that makes 2 ops spec asst for Yuanjing. Hu Wei Xiang is the chosen one. Yuanjing's got to be the envy of the battalion now... 2 assistance... Apparently csm wants Weixiang to be a backup incase Jeremy's strange illness acted up again, I personally think he just wants another person to help him "gather all the shit" So now i have 2 understudy... I already cannot cope with one, I really dunno how 2 teach weixiang...   Watever.... As Chin Kok says "When the time has come for you 2 go, u just go" With only 3days left, I must say&nbsp;95% into the&nbsp;ord mood. I was just sitting around, chit chating infront of everybody, it's like there really nothing they can do 2 u... haahaa... whatever things that needs to be done, i juz aim either one of my understudies 2 do. Raymond says i'm acting like a supervisor now...haa  I think i'm going crazy liao, everytime i log on to the internet, i keep looking at the website of my future university. Haahaa, I'm looking at accomodations, travel, food, lifestyle... it's like i juz can't wait to fly there right now!&nbsp; I'm planning my budget, thinking of what to bring there & everything....I'm juz sooo excited &amp; full of anticipation. somebody pls.... help me... haa

      Duties nowadays are slowly becoming a chore... it's getting harder & harder to do when ppl dun give a damn about whatever instructions u gave abt book in timing etc... I was rather pissed off this abt this... so I wrote an email addressing my concerns to all the ppl performing COS duty... but... 3SG Chan juz had to shown my half page long complains to our beloved csm... geez.... what an idiot....   Anyway... Jeremy seems to have finally cure himself of his "critital" illness.. he appear today & I was giving him the full course of my job... i juz sit there &amp; made him do everything...&nbsp;I think he's starting to wake up & smell the flowers that my job is not as easy &amp;&nbsp;"do nothing" as what some higher authority&nbsp;has said...&nbsp;maybe becos i'm quite strict & my "black" face was showing... cannot help it, I really need to whack him in shape. With Yuanjing going for Wallaby in Oct &amp; there's this chance he might be BME Ops Spec... Jeremy has really got alot to do... I really need to set his foundation right...  Today I had this thought... our coy seems rather petty... they like to fuss over small issues. Quek was been charged 7days SOL for running 3rounds instead of 4rounds...then there was this stupid issue over the level 2 toilet this afternoon abt who can & who cannot use the toilet... it's really quite stupid... Bigger issues like Hamdan's incident, Zul lost a logbook etc...are left hanging &amp; unsolved... this whole place is just turning crazy & upside down.... Boy am i gald to be out of there liao... 4 more working days &amp; 3 duties left....

      Yesterday was my clearance day.. Jus to update u guys some of the events during the process on dat particular day. It was a gloomy Thursday morning and unexpectantly, it began to rain the moment i left my hse to the infamous sembawang camp.&nbsp;Though the feeling of going back camp after 2 pure weeks of uninteruption&nbsp;is really bad, but no choice.. Clearance still must be done.  As i entered the office, i was greeted by hamdan, ang bingbing, and tay chow ching. I was quite delighted to see them actually (at least the first few pple i saw were not, uh hum.. u know who lah) But oh shit.. most of the pple are not ard. My mission for the day is to get the clearance done once and for all. But the situation seems unlikely.. To make matters worse, CSM entered. "Everybody here annot?" Haha no lah.. He has a very surprised expression as if seeing a stranger. After pausing awhile.. "Andrew, why must u leave us?" Haha i really dunno how to reply him but jus gave him a smile. He told me most of the pple are&nbsp;not ard n will be tough getting the clearance done. PC and OC were in east coast for AHM n won't be back till afternoon.  Then went over to hq office to zap my clearance forms. Suddenly, the door opened and Lim Y.Y appeared! He's the only one i felt indebted leaving him alone for the sake of my studies. Though there's a moment of silence between us.. He carried on his donation card calculations and i resumed filling in the forms. There was a sense of happiness within me, for i finally see someone so familiar. I broke the ice by asking him questions regarding the new elva's album he has recently bought and we began chatting. Then CSM came in again.. "Haiya come back also dunno how to buy something." Haha feeling embarrassed, i told him i'll buy the next time i come back to collect IC on sat.&nbsp;Only to know from him sat is a long wkend.. Haha too bad then.  RSM came to our coy to give our guys a lecture and it was quite quiet then (everyone's in the LT mah). The lecture ended and familiar faces came rumbling out.. Tan zw, chan jc, black baby, etc.. Then i had lunch at the canteen with lim yy, harkim, farquas, tang cw, and&nbsp;su gj. Though the food is still as bad, but the ambience of having all of us eating together is pretty not bad. Reminds me of the canteen breaks after our tasking hee.. After lunch, PC and OC were already back and I resumed my quest at the battalion HQ level. Wasted quite some time over there cos some big shots are either having lunch or meeting.. RSM is also no where to be seen.&nbsp; But after some waiting, all are done and i proceeded to S1 asking when to come back for my&nbsp;collection of IC. Only to know from the clerk dat unlike ord personnel, mine has to be collected at cmpb personally. Which means.. dat day is also my last day in sembawang camp (at least for the next 3 yrs lah). Hehe after bidding everyone goodbye, I walked out and&nbsp;took the bus with the words "sembawang camp" behind me&nbsp;slowly diminishing..

      Today is transport race... held at Safti MI, conducted by HQ/LTC. Well they provided a chartered bus there so no problems on getting there... Was actually quite sian as they broke up all the coys & group them into different groups. So I was like...boring... just another one of those events whereby u've got 2 go &amp; pretend to be happy and enjoying urself. Anyway, the event was held at the swimming pool. As for the games played, I would say rather new (at least it was for me) They had Mahjong tiles scattered all over the pool & we had to find the matching tile that was shown. Quite fun.   Well, the surprise of the transport race was that I was being nominated (I have no idea at all). Ang Bing Xiong being the other nominee. So we had to get in the pool & play this quiz game. Luckily they didn't ask us to swim or something. Questions are based on general knowledge, sports, entertainment etc... Guess What! We won first prize... hahaa... $50 Royal Sporting House Voucher... hehee, Nice farewell gift from 1tpt.... Well.. the irony was that I was chatting wif Andrew about how stupid the monthly best soldier award was and how there were no benefits and how&nbsp;transport race nomination is much better&nbsp;as they are vouchers given.  Jeremy..... Reported sick again&nbsp;as usual.... no surprise.&nbsp;I called him after the&nbsp;event to find out&nbsp;about&nbsp;his status & he told me he's&nbsp;still waiting to see the doctor.&nbsp;Time is already 1pm.&nbsp;I was like 1pm!&nbsp;I'm not going to believe that he waited&nbsp;at the hospital since 7:30am till 1pm...&nbsp;He&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;yesterday if&nbsp;I could reschedule my off&nbsp;so&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can teach him tommolo. Come to think&nbsp;of it... I'm 99.99% sure he will be on MC tommolo.....  Think I'll reschedule my off tommolo to another day..... (Dunno if i'm being stupid or wat) &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well, Andrew came back to camp today to do clearance... very happy to meet up wif him... feel like finally can meet someone whom can talk to... but the stupid rsm have to come and I'm stuck there listening to his crap for the whole morning.   Jeremy is on MC once again today as he was yesterday and the day before, I really dun know what kind of sickness is he suffering from? But I'm really pissed off this time. I called him and made him come&nbsp;back to endorse despite his usual complain of "very pain"&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;walk etc... I really want to see what kind of&nbsp;"painful" state is&nbsp;he really in.&nbsp;So much so that I told him to take cab if he cannot travel by bus. I know it's kinda harsh but I really cannot&nbsp;stand it when I'm putting in&nbsp;so much effort to come back, reserve all my stuff&nbsp;so that I can teach him&nbsp;hands on, but end up he take MC & I have to work&nbsp;OT to clear all the shit...  Anyway, he finally came back,&nbsp;first look....pretty normal, then he starts to have this very painful look on his face.&nbsp;Watever... I was still&nbsp;very pissed off and I kind of made that clear to him that I'm very unhappy about his daily report sick, daily MC thing. Hope he gets my message....&nbsp;

      After about 3&nbsp;consecutive weeks of weekend duty, I'm finally taking a break this week before embarking on another round of crazy weekend duty again... I needed the off lah so that I can hand over &amp; rid myself of all responsibilities forever..... &nbsp; &nbsp; Went to Sim Lim yesterday wif a friend to check out the latest computer prices, think it's about time I purchase a new laptop, so far the new models look rather attractive but the prices are not that nice liao... Anyway I took all the brochures back and then its time to start operation laptop on my dad, hahaa... Went over to HMV after that and what a sale they have there, spend almost 2hrs+ checking all the CDs trying to spot some bargains. Got 2 VCDs at $10 each and Elva's latest album (Sort of a Best of Elva type album) Great album, been listening to it non-stop. Andrew, u shld go get it.... did I mention there alot of v.nice photos of her included.....  &nbsp; Spend the whole of today lazing at home, played Samurai Warrior on my PS2, the gameplay is excatly the same as Dynasty Warrior, only difference is that the setting is in Japan, lots of samurai and ninjas, very nice. Think I'll been playing too much of japan fedual era games liao... going to watch The Last Samurai on my DVD later... hahaa.... &nbsp; Yeah!  &nbsp; Tommolo is going to be off day and so is Tuesday morning.......

      Aiyah this Jia Lo Mee really dunno what he's up to.. Given this new post should cherish it and appreciate pple's trust on him mah. Guess he's not interested in everything as long as he's in HMCT. But this is really hard on him lah.. Imagine he's the only one wif license in his entire platoon but yet he has to do all the shit wif the others, no wonder he's always finding ways to escape this reality. Haiz but in other words, since he's been given this new post he'll be sort of idemnified from some shit like details (not to mention standbys) n falling in. Its already the best scenerio given the bad siutation liao. Think what u can do now&nbsp;is only talk some sense to him lor.. Let him know how fortunate to be given this post n if he carries on no one can help him next time.

      Well... Jeremy is finally back frm his super long MC. Sadly...my suspicion of him "kenging" MC&nbsp;is starting to hold some truth. He sounded like he's dying&nbsp;just before&nbsp;day before he came back to work, but when he's finally back, he looks so healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My fears of him of not being able to undertake my job is also beginning to unfold. He's computer skills doesn't seems to live up to expectation &amp; &nbsp;extreme carelessness. But these are not impt, can be &amp; will be&nbsp;improved as time goes by, wat I cannot tolerate is his apparent lack of interest &amp; initiative. &nbsp;He seems to be acting only upon my instruction, doesn't seems to clarify any doubts he has.  &nbsp; He's also starting to enjoy himself with the "perks" of being in the Coy HQ, he sort of self declared stay out. Even worse was that he self declare himself off today! He did not even inform Yuanjing or CSM! It was only when I question him about him going for off that he admit that he did not seek permission. I told Yuanjing to freeze all his off &amp; control him until he is able to work &amp; produce some results. &nbsp; I'm worried for him for if he does not get his act together fast, "End Day", his the one who's going to end up crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Super relex day, no OC, no PC, no CSM, no nothing... everyone is away at that stupid Mousedeer & ATS. The "Mood" is getting stronger and stronger everyday. I'm just sitting away in the office chit chatting with Raymond yesterday & B*tch.com today. Only once in a while I'll touch abit here and there. Haha, the feeling is GREAT! Fallout timing was a history in the making, 1630 yesterday & 1600 today. Wahaahaa...  Jeremy is still sick.... Everytime his MC expires, he calls to report sick. I'm beginning to suspect he's in league with Sasi in getting MCs. I called him this morning and he sound rather gd. He promise me he'll be back tommolo. I'm only 50% convinced.   Damn, my computer screwed up again. I have no idea why that keeps happening.. maybe it's not getting enough vitamins & vegetables. Lack of exercise might also be a factor, so here I am using my old PC, no ICQ, no gunbound...haiz....

      Major Cock up today, This mousedeer thing is driving me nuts. Firstly I did not do the LOA(Arms) for those going on this mousedeer thing on monday. Then I have no LOA for the signal equipment which needed to be mounted up on the landrovers. Afterwhich that small boy Lee called me and told me they will be firing blanks and he needs 3 magazine per person as well as the blank attachment. All these nonsense could have be prevented if the two PCs have sat down with us to discuss on this whole Ex. thing. But what was the 2 PCs doing the whole of yesterday? Playing computer games with C&C!   Anyway I went back, did the necessary LOA & paperwork, afterwhich I pass the rest of the shit to Hakim. Sometimes I think i'm abusing him too much. Sorry man.....

      Yesterday was Farquar's belated birthday celebration & boy we gave him a party! Eggs were thrown and flour was all over the place... Haha.. It's been some time since we had such fun....  Guess I'm really starting to "Mood" & start to really slack off even though my precious understudy is still not back from MC. Can't really be bother anymore... I went back without doing my VAS! Slacked in the office the whole day with the "B*tch.com" (Koh Chin Kok), booking FFI, planning leave forecast & all sort of ORD fantasies...Haha... It's about time lah....  Went to catch Spiderman just now with Farquars, Hakim & the small boy Lee.. Hmm... A rather ok show, I'll give 3/5. But the girl was quite sweet looking....heehee Well, supposed to go on off tommolo but...as usual last min, things screwed up again & I've got to go back tommolo at the expense of my off to clear up the mess. (Yuanjing's on off too, It's his b'dae, give him a break) Haiz...

      Yeah! Armstoke screwed up! It's about time... Was supposed to collect the new FFF from Kevin today but guess what... He did not get the FFF signed by the armourer. James was at the range and the attached armourer was away at ALB. Haha.. Luckily Yuan Jing got an armourer friend over at NS branch who came to help sign the thing... Rest of the day was pretty busy due to the expected last minute changes to details & standby personnels etc...  Jeremy's operation went smoothly, apparently it went so smoothly that the doctor give him only 2days MC. Comparing his operation with Wong's operation, Jeremy looks more like a medical appt instead.  Heard a rather shocking news in the afternoon. Hamdan got into an accident at MSVS. It was raining and the ground must have been wet and slippery. His vehicle skied, he panic and engaged reserve gear, as a result the vehicle hit the wall of the MSVS and part of it collaspe. I didn't go down to see it for myself but from the stories I've heard there was a big hole in the wall. Heard OC & the rest of the big shot at the range rush back immediately. Guess trouble is brewing and the volcano is heating up. It's just a matter of time before the lava spits....  Hope that these will be the last of such incident

      Was finally relived of my stupid duty this morning, I then settle some stuffs, fix a note on my PC with the following words - Duty Rest! Very Tired! Haahaa... Well guess wat, except for the ocassional phone calls from the office, I finally managed to sleep till lunch time, truely wonderful experience.  I believe the rest and the extreme peacefulness in the office really helps. As usual there were some cock up on detail & ops bacinet. To my surprise, I actually manage to resolve all these problems without much sweat. Hehe....guess I'm finally getting the hang of this job...

      Was on duty again on Sunday... What a surprise it was for Greece to win the Euro cup. I was actually having this gut feeling that Greece might win and I wanted to bet some $ on a Greece win, but then again, I've lost a bit of $ in the previous matches, so I decided against betting... Guess that I just don't have the luck to win $  It seems that something will surely happen whenever I'm on duty, this time round, the problem lies with Winston... Met him in the morning at the DO room and told him that my COSA has gone for NDP detail so that leaves just me to man the office and double up as duty driver... He then told me to call the "old man" to call him later. The tone and the way he said it was in a rather joking manner, so I just brush it off aside. I met him again in the afternoon to discuss about the issuing of arms as there was a complain about the cock up of timing on saturday. He did not mention anything abt the "old man" calling him, so I thought he should have forgotten about it. Later in the night during staff parade, he got angry abt why the "old man" did not call him, naturally I came up with lame excuses which he did not believe of course. Then he say I lie to him follow by disobeying of orders and that he could have charged me for that. My God! It's so Francis Peh.... I then got the "old man" to talk to him and after some professional acting and sweet talking, he did not pursue the matter. What a B*tch!  Another incident which further strengthen my hatred and resolve to leave that place.

      Firstly thks for the invitation.. Glad you've found an understudy n hope Jeremy will get more involved after being designated this position. Wah ur duty dat day seems very eventful.. Ya lah, I find dat armskote is always the source of problem for COS. Very troublesome.. our work in the office is already making us struggle yet everyday must walk over to issue arms. For those more unlucky ones who kena standby or exercise day even worse, issue until blur. Sign in sign out over n over again.. no wonder Chris also see stars. Last wk when i'm on duty even worse, i sign in correctly.. but on the wrong bk. Haha that was for NSman Bk-in/out.. Dat Kevin also threatened to make me sign extra but eventually jus gave a verbal warning. Anyway jus one plus month for u before clearing lve so jus bear with it lor. Meanwhile take care n keep in contact!

      My very first posting.... Stumble upon this website while browsing through the internet. Well, thought that it will be great if I can get the rest of the HMCT gang here since we are all ORDing and chances of meeting each other & keeping in contact will be difficult. This will be a great place for us to write what happening around us each day. I must try to get the rest to join....  Geez.. It's been a very long week and it's just going to get longer. Well, finally got myself an understudy, Jeremy, but he has to go for an operation and I'm afraid that he might not recover in time for me to teach and hand over my stuffs to him. Nevertheless, I've decided that even if I have to go back while clearing my off/leave to coach him, then that's what I'll do. All the best for his operation & hopes he get well soon...  Was on duty yesterday & I was soo busy, working & coaching Jeremy since Morning, didn't even have time to take a break, ended up working till 10pm when my account was logged out. Yet my OC still thinks I'm just a slacker in the office... Sighz.... Sometimes I wonder why on earth am I working so hard for this company when no one appreciates??  Being on duty was bad, what's worse was there's Range the next day, as always, I decided to get Chris to help me issue the arms for the range personnel. However, Chris forgot to sign out from the armstoke and trouble arises. What makes my blood boil is that Kevin from the armstoke, complains that I, being the COS of the day was not there to do the issuing, and wanted me to sign extra for it. I was so pissed off that I didn't even bother trying to sweet talk that fellow, I just told him to complain and I will sign the extras. What's wrong with a stand-in for issuing of arms? What's worse was the DO himself did not sign out of the armstoke too, was he being complain? NO! Goes to show how "dark" the army is. Nothing is Fair in this world.....  YY

      Yesterday was Friday the 13th, Battalion Anniversary. Was not on off/leave but heck.. decided that no one would know anyway...so i decided to sleep throughout & not go to work (it was a half day). Msg CSM &amp; found out that my name was included in the Dinner that day... so i've got to attend... thought i could smoke through that too...  Anyway... the dinner was held at Yishun Central, Crown Palace Resturant... Rather budget as compared to last year. The place was half the size & the food was also half the quality. Talk about fake shark fin &amp; abalone. However there was freeflow of beer this time... Yeah! Drank quite abit myself. Last year, there was a drunkard Rajoo making a fool of himself in his speech, this year, before the whole event started, Staff Hari looks rather drunk, going rd table shouting & yelling. Poor Faquars, he was sitting at another day with Goh Teck Hong, Jonathan etc.. I wonder how much beer they made him drink, he was sitting there very daze &amp; his face was flush red hot!  I was sitting with the coy hq personnels at the back & we were trying to get the attention of the waitress... one of them was rather cute. Small size, cute looking... She came over eventually &amp; we requested for beer, orange juice etc.. & while she was pouring the glasses for us, I was signalling to Chris to take a photo of her.. haa... not too sure if he succeeded or not.. After that while the food was served, there was another waitress. This one is horrible, while clearing the plates for us, she started talking to us &amp; tell us that she's chinese & not malay. She a female version of Poh Wee Chong. We then retorted that we didn't even ask her. After that we started targetting her. We insist that she bring the drinks &amp; each time she came, we started to disturb her, asking her name, age & is she schooling. Then some ppl started telling her abt Poh Wee Chong.. Haa.. U shld see the look on PWC's face...  The performance by MDC was great, lots of singing & dancing. The whole atomsphere was so different from last year. Ppl were shouting, dancing all over the place. U sld see Ms Pang dance! The center of the resturant seems to be transform into a mini dance floor. The charlie guys were all dancing there. Very wild night. There was also a talent time contest. Hey.. never knew that Jack, the POL man could play the guitar & sing well. Well, no surprises, our very own Singapore Idol Wannabe Sasi took part &amp; won first prize. Actually he did sing pretty well that night.  There was the usual award presenting & no surprise... our beloved HMCT coy swapped almost everything again... Best IPPT, Best ATP &amp; Best Discipline. The other two awards on lowest accident & stuffs of course went to LTC. Sadly we lost almost all the sports award to Alpha &amp; HQ. No surprises either... juz look at the size of the ppl we have.. haa...  Well, the whole event ended ard 2230. Although the dinner & the place was rather budgetted, (No door gift!) it was very much different frm last year. Enjoyed myself, gald I went...

      Sorry guys couldn't join for the gathering during National Day.. Really wanted to meet up since it's tough having everyone together. But got something to attend dat day lor.. Glad u guys really had fun.  But dat day was quite funny lah.. My dad, my bro n me were supposedly buying dinner home and we expected a big crowd after the parade (becos my hse is near the stadium). So we decided to stop watching the TV n left home 10 mins before 8pm. Surprisingly the roads were almost empty.. We were proceeding well to Kallang Airport market to get our food, only to discover the main road to it is blocked by police! Having no choice my dad detour n stop at the traffic junction in front of National Stadium cos of red light. Then... fireworks came shooting up the sky jus on top of our car! The view was spectacular! We wind down our windows n caught a real glimpse of the impressive display. Phew.. it was the first time of my life to watch fireworks so near! For the 1 min or so at the junction i swear my mind was not thinking of anything else (i guess everyone would feel the same if they were in my shoes dat time). It was so loud, so near, n so memorable. Coincidentally, after the display was over the traffic lights turn to our favour. Unbelievable isn't it? Haha.. we weren't meant to watch it but the timing was too good to be true lah. In the car my dad n bro were praising ourselves for leaving home earlier n manage to catch a glimpse of the highlights of dat particular day. However not soon after we were still caught in a big traffic jam as soon as spectators of the parade came rushing out. But in our mind we knew dat the happiness has far exceeded anything else..

      Yesterday was National Day, this time round, i didn't go hunting for the tickets... afterall no stef sun, no yy... the both of us go hand in hand.  Met up wif the hmct gang at cityhall. It's a pity Andrew, Thambi & Battalion How couldn't make it... Went over to Suntec to catch a movie.. "The Village". Before deciding on this movie, read various reviews abt it &amp; got mislead into thinking it's a horror movie. Ended up, I was "horrify" after realising the "Twist" in the show. The show was rather draggy & was actually quite bored... I do find the "Monster" rather lame... But credits muz be given to the actors coz i think the acting was great... so overall i give 3/5... Watch only if there's nothing better to see...  After the show, went to Kenny Roger for dinner. Actually it's rather affordable, always thought it's quite exp to dine there... We ended up sitting there till the shop close... Chatting abt what's going on wif our new life, the current coy, the old francis era coy etc...  it's was really a great time & wonderful time!! Too bad no photo... maybe i'll bring a camera next time rd...

      Everything is proceeding as i have foreseen. Soon the whole coy will collaspe.  When back today with the intention to finalise my handing over & do the necessary signing. To my dismay, Jeremy is on MC since yesterday. I have given up hope on him liao. Yuanjing ask me to help him to juz settle the VAS for him one last time.  Jeremy told me on Weds that he had already settle July's VAS & tells me everything is proceeding fine. I took a look at July's VAS &amp; it's terrihobble (Terrible + Horrible). The VAS is all over the place, some days are missing, some are incomplete & some are not signed. I took a look at Aug &amp; it was even worst. Sighz... I give up! I sorted out the July's VAS & got them all in order again. I refuse to touch the Aug one. I'm juz not going to help them with this... I then did a check on the standby pagers &amp; as expected, BIG MESS. Some were not collected back, some were collected but never signed. Hiaz... don't care, don't care, I kept telling myself.  I thought that the coy now is gearing up for the LRI Prep, but when i enter the office today, the drivers are all gone, the omni-powerful sect comds are sitting around playing chess. The only person that I see that is not yet rot is Cartoon. He's the only one who kept pestering the rest of them to stop playing & get to work. Finally they left but... they're back after an hour &amp; resume their chess game all the way till fallout.  I've heard the C&C partnership has fallen apart. Cheok is trying to get transfer out. Chan is using his influence to rally the other sect comds to join his cause. I've always thought Tang Chee Wah Wah is the netural party, but it seems that I've thought wrongly. I dunno he juz gives me that feeling.  Everything seems to be falling apart in the company. The whole picture looks so rosy on the outside, everyone is like so happy, one big family. But deep within the core, it's starting to rot. Reminds me of the stupid rotten apple story that Francis Peh like to say.  I am just so glad that when the coy collaspe, i'll not be inside the pile of rubble nor will I be the one standing by the side trying to pick up all the fallen pieces. I'll be the one who's going to be sitting at home watching the news and pictures of them climbing out of the mess and trying to fix it back.

      The good times are slowly becoming boring. There's really nothing much to do except to play games and my level of gaming had somewhat dwindled. Somehow lost the power to play non-stop. There are times during the day whereby i'll juz sit there & stare at the wall, not knowing what to do.  Well, i did made plans to create a website but...the motivation's not there... afterall i am and will always be a professional slacker. So here i am lazing ard my computer again..typing things which are not making sense and not constructive....

      Hey hey hey... back in camp today, felt like a king, nobody can make me do anything, Yuanjing ask me to help him do something, i juz brush it aside & csm not ard.. haa... sat there &amp; chit chat with chin kok, raymond & oc the whole day.  I heard Jeremy was on mc again yesterday, no wonder he did not reply my sms when i msg him to ask if there's any problem. Well.. it's really none of my concerns now, after a 2hr consueling session wif one of my friend last sat night, i finally manage to let go of everything. It's their job now, not mine, they shld work according to their own style & if they screwed up, it's their heads... so with that in mine, i juz couldn't be bother anymore. Jeremy ask me to vet through the VAS for today &amp; i said no. It time he work independently. I have this feeling that I do not recongise Weixiang as my understudy. I juz feel that he's there as an extra helper, some sort of general office helper. I cannot bring myself to teach him anything. He doesn't seem really interested as well, disappearing from time to time and didn't bother to approach me. So who cares.. not my problem...  Great feeling, did some adjustments to my leave forecast &amp; found that hey.. 1/2 more day to go before the great holidays.. heehee... nice...

      Wahh Lim mood liao right.. haha can feel the happiness you're in right now. Finally waited for this time haa..  Hmm for me rather stress this wk.. Though it's only the first wk and so-called orientation wk, but it's stressful adapting to university life. Always tot it's quite similar to poly life but i'm wrong. Here.. information regarding modules, tutorial n lecture schedules, even the programs for the orientation have to find out by ourselves (no more spoonfeeding). What's more.. feel abit of loneliness cos majority of my coursemates have known each other thru orientation camps n also some were from the same JCs. So for me it's like kinda outcast liao hee..  Haha.. but it was quite pleasing to meet Tang last monday. He's still the same lah.. but we chatted alot more than we used to be in camp. What's more surprising is we both actually saw LTA Loh, our ex PC! He's in engine yr 2 now.. Also saw LTA Azmin, alpha PC. He's in the same faculty as Tang.  By the way, did u guys went for the fireworks display at Esplanade last sun? I went and it was quite spectacular lah.. There was a big crowd ( the most pple i've seen in esplanade) but the actual display last a mere 5 mins though we waited quite long from the intended 8pm. Hmm not a wasted trip i would say.. But those who wished to see dun be disappointed. Last wk was performed by the US and this coming sunday would be Singapore (who self claim to be the best) and the following by Hong Kong. So make sure dun lose this opportunity again huh.. Bring ur loved ones for those who have or ask ur frens along!
