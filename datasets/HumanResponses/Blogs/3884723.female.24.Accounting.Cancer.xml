      Patrick and I have been playing around with Instant Messager lately. Using it to communicate while at work and school. And we've been each trying to find a Buddy Icon that really represents who we are. Well, Patrick at first selected a picture of us...the one on my profile. Then, we moved onto pictures that brought out our individual qualities...for Patrick it was maclaptop photos, pictures of Richard Feynman, boobs, and even Dr. Evil. However, I still did not have something to accurately represent myself. Until I thought of an amazing idea for a buddy icon - a nice shot of a penis! How wondrous! Something to truly inspire humor for all...because, after all, all one can do really is laugh at the sight of one! Unfortunately, finding a good shot of a penis is actually quite hard to find. At least for me, the "virgin-to-internet-porn," it has been somewhat of a challenge.  Aside from a lack of penis photos, lots of interesting things have been going on! Patrick and I may finally have some definite plans for our future! Our immediate and exciting future. One must always have a plan...and be ready to implement it at any given moment. So, we are going through all the procedures of readying ourselves for this new life. You too are privy enough to enjoy a sneak peak of our possible future  urlLink here .  Today was another exciting day in the Book of Patrick and Jamie. We lazily awoke (after a night of wine, cake, pirate's booty, kettle popcorn, and a late night run for beer) and began a day. We intended on being productive. Patrick called his parents and chatted for an hour or so. Then he showered and left to get some work done at school.  I then called my parents to discuss wedding plans. My mother put down the deposit for my hometown's country club reserved currently for the reception. But now I have to convince my dad that Patrick and I do not need to get married in our boring Catholic "super-modern" church. However, I would rather get married in this old chapel in the downtown of this historic city nearby. It is the same church my parents got married in (my mom and step-dad). I was six and very happy to be one of the flower girls (along with my sister). I put on quite a show...tripping down the ailse, giggling, and sitting on the banister &amp; falling backwards in the middle of the ceremony. Then, I remember crying for a long time after I didn't catch my mother's bouquet. Its a cute little church with stain-glass windows and a chandelier in the sancutary. My dad (really my step-dad) is Catholic and wants me to have a Catholic wedding...even though he himself did not when he married my mom. Anywho...so I am working on him...making sure he knows how much it will mean to me to have it in the same church he got married in.  After getting off the phone, I hopped into the shower and actually got ready for the day. Pretty good for a Saturday! I even fixed my hair and put real make-up on! And dressed nice for Patrick and I's Saturday Matinee movie. We saw  Napoleon Dynamite .  Good...but thought it was going to be better.  I was thinking more along the lines of  Welcome to the Dollhouse  kind of movie.  But not so much.  Then we hit the Buffet Palace - a regrettable experience. Still regretting that moment. And it wasn't even that good. I wish I had gorged on champagne and cake icing instead. Oh well. Maybe we'll do that tomorrow!  On our way home we took our fortune cookie 'lucky numbers' and used them to purchase some lotto tickets.  It was fun!  Now we are watching the tale-end of  The Talented Mr. Ripley .  That movie always stresses me out.  But I love getting the free shots of Europe and Italy!  Can't wait to go there.

      So, today I am having major brain failure at work.&nbsp; Really, I am so useless I should be at home already.&nbsp; But who knows, I'd probably be just as useless there...and at least I am getting paid here.&nbsp; I have done absolutely nothing today except, perhaps, inform my boss that I will be moving to California before too long.&nbsp; He wasn't extremely shocked...even said he figured I was on my way out soon.&nbsp; I wonder if its because I have been reluctantly dragging my feet into work only to do nothing but sit around on my lazy butt for 8 hours.&nbsp; Sometimes only 7 if I muster up the energy to a lunch off the premises.   &nbsp;   urlLink     Darn Brain!&nbsp;   But in my defense, I was unable to sleep last night.&nbsp; Due mainly to the fact that for the past three days I have been horribly constipated.&nbsp; Like...to the point where my stomach has been feeling sick all the time.&nbsp; So, I took a laxative last night before I went to bed.&nbsp; Usually those things take hours upon hours to work.&nbsp; If I take them the night before, I usually have a bm around lunchtime.&nbsp; But, I must have been so backed up, the second I took a laxative my body used that as fuel.&nbsp; Around midnight I was awaken by the urge to run to the toliet screaming.&nbsp; Wait, no no...that was wrong.&nbsp; Just an urge to run to the toliet...but I should have been screaming.&nbsp; I was there for the next couple of hours.&nbsp; And when I wasn't there...I was wishing that the toliet was closer or possibly for a built-in toliet in our mattress.&nbsp; Needlesstosay, my night was not of pleasant dreams and long endless sleep, but rather one of tortured insides and feverish dreams of pooping my pants.&nbsp; (Sorry, couldn't find a more kosher way of putting it)   So, alas, my brain is the victim.&nbsp; And the moment I get home I am taking it out of my head and recharging its batteries!

      Over the weekend I finally got my cell phone that I have been wanting. Its a Sanyo 8200 camera phone. I went forward with Sprint's PCS Clear & Free America plan. I can't believe I finally have a cell phone again. I kind of rebelled against them for a short stint of time. But, now with all the upcoming changes, it just seemed to make sense. It is so much fun having a camera on it, too! Plus it came with two months of free wireless internet service. I don't think I have had this much fun with a cell phone ever before. The last cell phone I had was one of those early Nokia's. I mean, those are SO boring compared to this thing. Plus I paid $90 for my Nokia back in the day. This thing was only $100 but is a million times better. I've already gone a little crazy with the camera and taken some random photos of random people at bars and of Patrick &amp; I. Plus Patrick made sure that my drunkin' adventures from Saturday were made eternal through the magic of digital photography!     BEFORE BOOZE:     urlLink      Big Pimping, spending G's... On my way to a fantastic night!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    AFTER BOOZE:      urlLink       Refer to me as Bumpster. Pukie Bumpster.     Nothing like a shot of my face on the porcelain throne!&nbsp; Laugh now...but it could be you!  Other than my new exciting cell phone...not much else is going on. Patrick and I had a great weekend. So great, in fact, I have been inspired to quit both my jobs to live a life of laziness with Patrick. But, alas, duty calls. Plus, I think I might finally be getting health insurance! I turned my application in last week and should have a card by August 2. Then I've got to immediately go to both a dentist and an OBGYN. Especially before the haul across the states! Radical...can't wait for that trip.   SHOUT OUT TO MY HOMEY G-WHEATS!

         My favorite number is 18.          That is all I have to say today…nothing remarkable.    Nothing deep or extremely personal.    Just that 18 is my favorite number.

                              Few people are true connoisseurs of junk food, like myself.    I personally only know of one other person who likes to eat icing straight out the tub – my best friend Shannon.       And not just a spoonful here or a spoonful there.    I’m talking eating the entire tub of icing.    I’m even talking about deliberately making  urlLink homemade butter crème icing  specifically with the purpose of sitting and eating the entire bowlful with a spoon by yourself.    It happens to be one of my favorite things to do.            Yes, I realize how grossly horrible that sounds…and sometimes, it is.    I mean, who eats lard by the spoonful?    Well, I do.  When I’ve plopped myself down on the couch with a bowl of icing…its me who doing that (technically).    Not to mention, I’m sure eating icing doesn’t exactly help me keep off the pounds or keep my cholesterol down.    But it just tastes  so good  to me.  From the first fluffy, heavenly bite...all the way to scrapping the bowl for tiny sweet moments, I savor each and every spoonful. And even if I were to get the slightest bit sick of the sweetness, I would simply take a sip of the champagne glass (that inevitably sits nearby) to cleanse my palate.             However, I usually can eat quite a bit of junk food and still not get sick of it.    Most normal people get sick of junk food pretty quick.    And I remember a time long, long ago when I, too, was one of those people.    But around third or fourth grade…I started realizing that I really liked junk food.    Cakes, ice cream, cupcakes, wafer bars, chocolate bars.    I had so many favorites, not just one!          By the time I was fourteen, I realized I may have taken my love for junk food a bit too far as I noticed that I never lost the babyfat that my surrounding friends had lost.    But did that stop me?    No way!    I just quickly realized I would one day have to be a dieter if I was going to be able to enjoy the foods that I cherished.                      My love for junk food is still so strong even now...even when I see that I am in a battle.    Constantly fighting little wars.    One day I am eating doughnuts and cake and drinking champagne and laughing and happy.    The next I am eating only certain foods under a certain amount of calories and swearing junk food off.   Never again!   I will say.   Never will I eat poorly again...from now on its fruit, vegetables, and fish!   And then, I see a picture of a pretty cake or a bubbling glass of champagne and can’t resist the urge to make a batter of icing or head to the local H.E.B. and pick out my favorite sparkling wine.    Too bad I couldn’t just live off cake and champagne and be healthy.  :(

         Yah! It's my birthday! And while today is my actual birthday, Patrick and I celebrated my birthday Saturday night (well, actually all weekend). It was the best birthday weekend I've ever had. My birthdays are just getting better and better.  Friday, I checked out of job #1 a little early and headed to job #2. I wrapped up there pretty quick and on my way out the door saw my friend, Annie. She is my favorite person (that I have met in   Austin  ). She is so interesting & unique. She is also the reason why I am into Hip-Hop at all. She is really into DJs &amp; Hip-Hop and dresses really cool. Anyhow, so she invited Patrick and I to go out with her and her friends to this club (I had been to before). I decided that going out with Annie would be the perfect start of my Birthday Weekend. But until then, what to do?  When I got home I asked Patrick if he had any ideas what we should do tonight. We decided to go see  13 going on 30  at the Discount Theater (yes...a girly birthday movie for me) and then swing by   Tuscany   afterwards. I loved the cheesy bad-acting in the movie. It was perfect. I was in the best hyperactive fun mood after the movie. From the theater, we went to home. Then we walked over to   Tuscany  . I was quite chatty for a sober person. And since I was already acting like a tipsy birthday girl and Annie wasn't going to get off work for another hour or so, we went next door and had drinks at the Riata Bar and Grill. I had a Cosmopolitan (my usual) and a Chocolate Martini (for the first time). It’s my new favorite drink!  Once Annie got off work, we got directions to the bar and then walked home to get my car. We headed to the bar pretty quick, but Annie and her friends didn't arrive immediately...so Patrick and I made some fun of our own by checking out various guys and girls. We reported back opinions and judgments. It was fun and kinda crazy. I had my third drink, White Russian (another usual). The whole night started to become a blur at that point of dancing and laughing and talking. It became even more so of a blur once I had my fourth drink. We went to Katz's (24 hours NY style deli) afterwards, it was the perfect treat. Patrick and I had a drive home. We crashed as soon as we go into bed around  4 am .  Saturday I woke up bright & early (being the crazy early bird that I am) at 7am and let Patrick sleep in. I first went on a walk for an hour. Then, I played Sims, ate food, watched  Monsters, Inc. , and (once that was over) watched some Saturday Morning Cartoons (which all suck now). When Patrick finally graced me with his presence, it was almost  11am . I was already in my bathing suit, so we decided to put on some sunscreen and head to the pool. We also planned a trip to the Discount Movie Theater to see  Mean Girls  for afterwards. The pool was fun. Very relaxing. Good way to start off my "Saturday Birthday."  Mean Girls  was a fun movie. And getting to see it for $1.50 really made the whole experience worthwhile. Then, we went home and started the chore of getting ready for a fancy night out. I fixed my hair, did my make-up extra special, and put on a cute dress. Patrick recently bought this pink shirt just to wear for me on my Birthday. He dressed up in that shirt and some nice charcoal pants and looked very handsome. We planned to go to the Driskell Hotel's restaurant and then swing by Central Market on the way home for a birthday cake. And we would do all the presents after that.  We found the restaurant pretty quickly...and also realized pretty quickly that we were in some trouble. The place wasn't just a nice fancy restaurant. It was THE NICEST, FANCIEST (a.k.a. most  expensive ) restaurant we've been to in   Austin  . And for me personally, it was probably the nicest restaurant I have ever been to. And, I mean, I have been to some really nice restaurants (as far as main stream restaurants go). It was so nice. We had one main waiter and three helper waiters. It was all very proper and fancy. And while I feel very uncomfortable (as a person with my loud personality); the whole process is very enchanting for me. Watching the waiter play his role as a servant of sorts (putting my napkin in my lap for me), saying words like complimentary, and trying so very hard to make sure we were satisfied at all times. I ordered a glass of champagne to start with (and thank God I only had one). When I was looking at which champagne to get, I looked at all the prices. They were all in the double digits (18, 24, 38, and 50). So I assumed they were by the bottle. First mistake. And on my defense, we had not even seen the real menu yet...so at this point...I wasn't quite aware of just how expensive it really was. So, I went with the cheapest kind (a Brut Rose). Later we, of course, discover that the prices were by the glass. So, I had an $18 glass of champagne. Crazy...I know. We don't even buy whole bottles of wine that cost that much! We ordered the Fixe Prix (Five Course?) The meal (or meals, rather) was/were to die for...amazing combinations of sauces and foods. The salmon was tantalizing...the pork tenderloin was heaven and the rice that went along with it was the best rice I've ever had.  In the middle of course three and four, Patrick slid a white bag across the table. I immediately opened it to see a beautiful set of pearls inside. The necklace was really heavy feeling, too. I attempted to put it on (but it took a moment or two because it has this clever gold clasp that isn't easily removed or put together). Once it was on I felt completely perfect. At a Fancy restaurant with my fiancée, drinking champagne, receiving a pearl necklace as a birthday gift, eating delicate & tasty meals...I felt like I was on my dream fantasy date or something. It was the perfect, perfect birthday dinner.  To break the fantasy, the dessert was only so so. The best part about it was the ruby red grapefruit next to it. They had pulled slices of the grapefruit and then put sugar crystals on top and flamed the sugar to create a slightly crisp sweetness along with the taste of grapefruit. It was very delightful.  Other than that...dessert certainly was not sweet enough to make the taste of the bill any better. It came to a total of $193 (with taxes and tips in that amount - but still!). I almost gasped out loud. And poor Patrick had to lay his card down on that. Stinky. And he didn't even really enjoy it. He felt like we were there for an eternity. (They like to pace you and make sure you don't get full...which means a lot of waiting around for the presentation of the next meal). But I had so much fun...I was a giddy schoolgirl the whole time.  We made it to Central Market just in time to get a cake before they closed the place down. I managed to grab a mini bottle of my favorite champagne (Martini &amp; Rossi Asti Spumante) - I know, I know...not champagne...sparkling wine - but whatever. We coasted home and began the process of my actual birthday. I tidied up the living room and set my presents up next to the cake, put the candles onto the cake and even got a champagne glass out. Patrick lit the candles and sang a very lonely sounding  Happy Birthday  (not to be confused with the ever popular,  Jolly Bornday  tune many sing today). We took several pictures of me and my cake and presents. He seemed reluctant and pretty much over my birthday. I think dinner really wore him out. But I was still on cloud 9. Nice place to be, too.  I opened all my presents. They were all very, very good thoughtful gifts. I got a book called  Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities  and a book called  Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource.  Both are awesome!!! Why would he buy me silly books such as these? Well, regarding  Pledged , I was, once upon a time, a sorority girl myself. Strange, I know. And actually, I still am - technically - a sorority woman, now that I'm an alumnus. But, don't be misled, I wasn't a "sorority girl," but rather one of the outcast sisters...commonly referred to as the "art major" girl. Anything associated with art (banner painting, door decs, t-shirt designing, etc.), and I was called upon. Otherwise, most of the girls ignored me. I was moderately involved, though. And I still love my little sis...she will be one of my bridesmaids. Concerning the  Bobbi Brown Beauty  book....well, I recently started wearing Bobbi Brown make-up. It was a big step for me to buy real make-up. A big step towards Womanhood.  My next presents were a string thong bikini (that Patrick has been dying to buy for me) and a cute, flowery short skirt from American Eagle. He used my birthday as an excuse to give me the bikini. It’s actually really cute and doesn't look that bad on. Too bad it’s a thong and I can't actually wear it in public (because our apartment pool forbids thong bathing suits).  Patrick also gave me commemorative stamps. They were commemorating the film industry. Which is, of course, a reference to my degree (in Media, which for those who are not aware is film/video/photography) and passion for the art of cinema. Perfect little gift.  After presents were opened and photographed, I cut a piece of cake (the corner flower piece, of course) and poured some champagne. We watched  Toy Story  and then went to bed. Sunday I woke up not wanting to get out of bed (for a change) and realized that it was completely overcast outside. Which meant no Schlitterbahn. Boo!  Patrick and I stayed bed for a little longer and then decided to get up and go to the mall. The Mall had only just opened (even though it was  noon ). I purchased some make up from Bobbi Brown. Then we looked for salsa shoes. I finally settled on the first pair that I had spotted in Nordstrom's. We also managed to go by   Victoria  's Secret (much to Patrick's delight) and pick up a pair of free underwear and two cute panties. It was fun shopping! Patrick is the best shopping buddy. We also dropped by Express for Men and Ann Taylor, but either it was too expensive or not worth while.  While we were at the mall, I decided to check out various cell phone plans. I have recently decided that getting a cell phone (with a number from my soon-to-be new location) would be a really good idea. And I have managed to convince Patrick, a.k.a. cell phone hater, that him having a cell phone might not be that bad of an idea. Especially since he can be on the same plan as me...talk to me for free...have his own number...and have free long distance & roaming for a price comparable to just getting a land line. So, he is considering it. I have already decided that I will get that cell phone sometime this week or next. The sooner the better, because the sooner I get it, the sooner I can put it on my résumé and look like a local resident (thereby making me more approachable &amp; callable...thereby getting me a job sooner).  Anywho! So, after the Mall, we made a unanimous decision to go to South Central Market, pick up some meat, and cook out. It was fun. We bought jalapeño bread, jalapeño burger meat, and red wine. On our way home we picked up some Wheatberry Salad and some Pesto Pasta at   Tuscany   to complete the meal. We also went by Hollywood Video and rented  Girl with the Pearl Earring  and  Win A Date with Tad Hamilton . (While I was at it, I grabbed some Kettlecorn Popcorn, Junior Mints, and bottle of water). We grilled out (which took forever) and started to eat outside. However, I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, so we moved the party inside. We watched  Win A Date  and ate popcorn. Then I moved onto Junior Mints and birthday cake. All the while, we drank a couple glasses of red wine each. It was fun...eating and watching another cheesy girl movie. We went to bed pretty soon after (although I spent some time reading  Pledged ).  Today I have been miserably tired - my birthday weekend wore me out for my actual birthday! I really am feeling all that food. And I still haven't had my "Birthday Lunch" and my "Birthday Dinner." I am supposed to have the now traditional Sushi Birthday Lunch at Mikado’s (just like last year) with my friend. But I haven't heard from her just yet. If all else fails, my boss has offered to take me to lunch there. I plan on getting my all-time favorite pot stickers, a Caterpillar roll, some Eel sushi, and if I can manage it...a slice of chocolate cake. Yum. Tonight, I plan on going straight home and then going out to eat with Patrick. Perhaps to Cheesecake Factory...I've been craving the Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookie Dough Cheesecake. We still have cake leftover, though...and a mini-bottle of champagne that I bought at   Tuscany   the other day.  Then, I of course plan on immediately beginning a strict diet and exercise program. When will the craziness end?

      So, now it’s a total of 12 pounds lost on the fast.  My energy levels are still really high.  Still keeping the H20 flowing.  The only troublesome symptom is heart palpitations.  I can tell my heart has began to beat harder and then much too fast when I exert myself only a little.  I tend to panic when this happens (which only worsens the condition).  But, it is completely normal when fasting.  Plus I still haven't really had any fades (when you get up too fast and everything gets black for a second and fades back).  I am only having the tiniest dizziness.  Barely notice it.  But I am sure that these symptoms will intensify as my fasting continues.  I might prematurely end my fast if these symptoms become bothersome.  Otherwise, I am stopping Sunday evening.  Regardless of my fast, my salsa dance lessons went remarkably well.  Patrick and I really seem to be improving...just need to get that pause on the fourth beat down.  And it’s hard when you’re counting 1-2-3, 5-6-7.  Because even though 4 is missing, you adapt to the saying of the numbers to do each step.  But the whole process is fun and rewarding nonetheless.  I can't wait for this weekend...Patrick and I are planning on going to  urlLink Schlitterbahn  for the day!  I love Water Parks, especially this one!  Sitting on tubes and laughing when we get stuck in a water swirl is my idea of the perfect day (as long as that day includes a Celtic festival somehow, as well).  Plus the weather is supposed to be nice.  Must remember to bring the Sunscreen.     4 Days Till My 24th Birthday!!!

      Ahhh, yes.  Another day of Fasting to battle with.  Actually, my fast has been quite easy this time around.  I haven't even had one dizzy spell or hunger attack.  My water intake has been phenomenal.  So, my third weigh-in last night confirmed a loss of 8.5 pounds total.  Right on track.    Tonight, I have a very exciting date with Patrick.  It will be our 3rd Salsa dancing lesson.  We also utilize this time to have a "date."  I am even wearing a very cute green dress from Express that has the perfect skirt-line for Salsa dancing.  Of course, my shoes are horribly wrong for Salsa dancing and don't go with my dress, but I will be forced to ignore those facts until I find the perfect Salsa dancing shoes.  Where would one find shoes, such as those?    And I guess I will begin the countdown today.   What countdown , you may be asking yourself.  The countdown to my 24th birthday!!! (Of course!)  My birthday is on Monday, July 19th.  Very exciting, indeed.  So, if you count today... 5 days until my birthday!!!   I love birthdays...especially when they are mine!  Unfortunately, my fast will run into my birthday and I don't think I will be able to enjoy my absolute favorite thing on earth...birthday cake!!  Horrid, I know.  But, oh, what one must forsake for one's health!  Which I am avid on obtaining (health that is).

      The Two Paths spread provides insight into an important decision ahead of you, the possible outcomes, and the forces that draw you towards each of these outcomes  The top left card represents the first possible outcome. Queen of Wands: The essence of fire behaving as water, such as a rainbow: The natural embodiment of passion and sensuality, who is always the center of attention. One who reflects the desires and ambitions of others, and ignites them. A radiantly vital person, cocky and charismatic, who sees what she wants and goes after it.   The top right card represents the second possible outcome. Justice: The achievement of balance and inner harmony after a great trial. Agreements, contracts, or treaties concluded justly. Things set to rights. Karma restored. A turn for the better in legal matters.   The middle left card represents the force drawing you towards the first possible outcome. The World: Completeness and intricacy of design. A great work. Achievement, reward, and well-earned recognition. A time of success, prosperity, security and joy. May also indicate travel or a change in residence.   The middle right card represents the force drawing you towards the second possible outcome. The Hanged Man: Pausing to reflect. Surrendering to an experience. Adjusting to new ideas through sacrifice. Opening oneself to intuition and enhanced awareness. Letting go of past patterns and growing beyond them. Inner peace, faith, and serenity.   The bottom card represents the critical factor that decides what will come to pass. The Star: New hopes and splendid revelations of the future. Insight, inspiration, courage and enlightenment of the spiritual self. Body and mind and converging towards the light at the end of a dark time.

      One funny thing about fasting is that you always dream that you cheat.  Last night I went to bed with my water bottle by my side and no food on my stomach (unless it was leftover from the chocolate cake I had at B.D. Riley's on Sunday).  Well, then every single dream I had involved being on the fast and sneaking a spoonful of peanut butter or eating some cheese.  I think, in the last dream, I had a full fledge eating fest that included cake (of course)!  But then I woke up nervous that I really did eat all that food (or that somehow dreaming about eating tons of food is going to affect my real-life fast).    Other than my dreams, my fast is going quite well.  I have already lost my appetite completely.  My water intake is above the necessary amount needed during a fast.  And I have lost 5 pounds (not real weight...it will return once I eat again).  But the point is to lose 5 pounds of toxic fat and gain 5 pounds of nutritious weight.  To document my progress (or lack there of, if that's the case), I am photographing myself every night with my weight in the bottom right corner.  It will be interesting to watch my tummy get smaller and smaller...and then once eating resumes again...get bigger again (well, not bigger, but normal sized).  Once I get the "photo-blogging" down, I will start posting photos [hopefully].

      After a full two weeks of complete & total gluttony, I have taken it upon myself to enforce a fast.  So, I am drinking only a gallon of water everyday for the next week  or until I feel I have cleansed my digestive system of all the impurities I have put into it.  So far, so good.  I have drank 128 oz of purified water and have spent the day resting (at my desk at work...of course).  I even enjoyed a scented heating pad of sorts around my neck while listening to Buddhist Monks chanting the "Harmony of T" and reading  "Wherever you go, There you are."  Very spa-like day.  I hope to continue these efforts, but how I do love cupcakes!  Must find some inner strength to resist cake at work tonight.    By the way, I have two jobs doing similiar work.  The first is at a security company (doing administrative management-type work and some accounts payable).  That's my "9 to 5" (even though I go to work at 7:30am).  My second job was originally suppose to be just for fun.  When I started, I was working in the coffee shop area of a place called  urlLink Tuscany Market & Vineyard .  I loved it!  But, then they needed someone in their accounting department to do payroll, AR, AP, reports and even some maintenance in the inventory system (Biztrack).  When they discovered my extensive experience in accounting - ok, extensive might be a bit much - of a year and a half, they immediately offered me the job.  Which has turned out to be perfect.  I get paid more, work less, and get to basically come in whenever I want and leave whenever I want (as long as I get the job done).  I like both my jobs because they afford me a life of laziness, truly.  I sit and do nothing all day and then work a couple of dutiful hours at Tuscany.  Too bad my life is about to completely and totally change.

      Another day of lounging around the apartment with Patrick.   urlLink    My favorite thing to do on the weekends is snuggle with Patrick!&nbsp;  Ain't love the sweetest thing? I didn't even get in the shower until an hour ago. Before I showered, we dined at Kerbey Lane for a late lunch. It was excellent. Plus it gave me an opportunity to work on my latest hobby: alcoholism. I consumed four beers Thursday night, three beers Friday night, two beers &amp; three glasses of wine last night, and three mimosas for lunch today. And we are on our way to B.D. Riley's (Irish Pub on 6th street) to have our now Traditional pint of Guinness. While drinking, we will be enjoying some local celtic music at the open session they hold every Sunday. Very exciting. Nice low-key night.   Favorite Celtic Tunes:   - Irish Washer Woman  - The Wedding Jig  - The Merry Sisters of Fate  - The Butlers of Glen Avenue   Nothing like a fine Irish tune and a pint of Guinness. Truly the sweetest things!

      I've noticed lately that I have been acquiring several bruises on various limbs.  For instance, the other day I woke up (with no hangover or reason to have one) and saw a huge new blue bruise on the inside of my wrist.  Strange place to have a bruise.  Now its green and yellow.  Bruises are funny.  Then as I was crossing my legs today while eating lunch, I noticed another bruise right above my knee.  Weird.  I know if you aren't eating enough things with iron that you can get bruises pretty easily.  But I've been taking my daily Flintstone vitamins and eating a cupcake a day.  So, I know I'm good.  Got plenty of Iron.    So...I know you are dying to know exactly what I have done today...since it is Saturday and I live in beautiful Austin, Texas.  So, surely I have gone to Town Lake to jog, or kayaking at Zilker park, or am spending the afternoon at Barton Springs Pool.  But no.  All I have done is lay around with Patrick.  We slept in (well till 9:30am...I'm kinda an early riser) and then ate breakfast.  Then we showered.  Then we spent an hour or two deciding what we wanted to do today.  (I played some Sims during this decisive time).  Um, and then we went to the Mall because we suck.  However, we did visit the new Apple store in Barton Creek Mall.  Pretty awesome.  Its brand new, so all the workers are still really attentive and there was an exciting buzz in the place.  That "new store" buzz that makes you feel like your part of something special.  And everything is new, shiny and untouched.  Brightly colored iPods and huge LCD monitors on all the displays.  I feel that out of all the  computer companies (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, etc.) that Apple deserves to succeed.  I personally do not owe a Mac, but Patrick does.  So, one day (due strickly to the benefits of marriage) I, too, will own a mac.  Don't flip out, Patrick will inherit a 2000 Saturn LS (because that is what I drive).  And he will need it as his Mazda is totaled and falling apart.

      I have decided to embark on a journey of sorts.  Right now it is a very exciting time in my life.  The journey I am beginning is a blogging journey - tracking these various and exciting events.  What are these events (you may be asking)?    - Saw Radiohead in concert.  Pretty big deal, right there. - Travelled to Ireland (for a mini-backpacking trip) for the first time.  As in, first time I left U.S. soil (and no, my senior trip to the Bahamas does not count). - Got Engaged (while in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day) to my best friend/roommate/boyfriend, Patrick. - Went 7 months without health insurance and realized that even though I am young, I can't be stupid. - Decided that even though I spent twelve years dreaming of being a film director (including the four years of college to get an art degree in Media), the reality has become that I am to be an Accountant.   - Discovered my polictically active side (well, I'm still independant but I've become well-versed & educated in all political parties).  Ok...so maybe these aren't events...but life is definitely happening.  Perhaps, we shall call them adventures, whimsical adventures...in life.  All these little whimsical adventures are occurring around me and I am sort of baffled.  In a matter of months, all three of my best girlfriends (that I had growing up) will be married.  Two of the three have already started their families.  And you know what...I am honestly just now getting over the fact that I can't play Barbies and Color anymore.  I can't believe I am engaged.  I feel like I am "playing dress-up" and walking around with a pretend wedding ring on my finger.  Not really knowing how to take it all in...so I am simply documenting it - letting it all hang out.  So...it begins here.

      I am still alive...just really busy.  Patrick's family (all six members) are in town this week, so I have been working through lunch so I can leave job #1 early to get to job #2 early, so I can leave job#2 early...so I can spend time with his family.  Plus I am taking Thursday and Friday off so we can go to Schlitterbahn and San Antonio.   Fun Stuff.

      Another Friday to stack on top of my already massive collection of Fridays. Oh what fun will this weekend entail? I am so excited about laying around and doing nothing. Oh wait...that's what I am doing right now.   urlLink      This is what I stare at all day long whilst working.     But everyone knows that laying around is way better at home (where there is lots of food...or at least you have the option of leaving whenever you want to get food). Right now I could use a nice batter of frosting, a chicken burrito, and perhaps a beer. Not in that order of course! Give me some credit...I am not that crazy!!!  Of course, some may say that prior statement is not true...some may say that I am, in fact,  Crazy . It is for reasons such as these...its 94 degrees outside and I am wearing jeans and a thick wool sweater with a heater blowing on my legs underneath my desk and I am the perfect temperature (refer to picture below),   urlLink      Don't I look sexy in my wool sweater?    Not to mention, I eat lots of food some days, insane amounts of food other days, and ungodly amounts of food on the weekends...yet still partake in dieting & fasting quite frequently.  Plus I do not participate in the quite normal activity of washing my clothes (commonly refered to as "Laundry"), I laugh at my own jokes (damn I'm funny), and sometimes I go to the bathroom in funny places (ex. bathroom sink, carpet under dresser, brother's hardwood floor, tupperware in the car).  And that's just the top of the list. I am sure I could go on and on.  But personally, I think everyone has some quirky qualities.  Who is really all that normal?  And if they are normal...they are probably boring too.  Not me though!

       urlLink      My cousin Bethany, my Mom, and me at Chimney Rock!     urlLink      Chimney Rock, North Carolina.     urlLink      These are my best friends from Elementary, Middle,      and High School. Starting from the left: Shannon,      Tara, ME, Pearl!    Going home, to my hometown in Johnson City, TN, is always an interesting experience. Seeing my family and friends from long ago. Observing how they have stay the exact same in some ways, and are people I don't even know in other ways. Pearl and Tara are both married and each have one baby boy. Pearl's is 2 and Tara's is only 7 months old. Shannon and I recently got engaged a week apart from each other. However, she is getting married in a month and 12 days. Once she is hitched...I will be the last to get married.  However, looking at my family (that I am close with), I will be the first one in my family to get married amongst my siblings. And I will be the first of my closest girl cousins, Bethany & Dixie, to get married. How odd. All three of them (my sister &amp; my cousins) always had steady boyfriends. Until now. Dixie did recently settle in with someone who she will probably marry, but she only just met him. And she is two years older than me (as is my sister)! My cousin Bethany is my age. She and my sister are both pretty single.  So, I guess one could conclude I am right where I should be...in the middle (as usual). I am the middle child, afterall. What a stigma!

      Once upon a time, Patrick and Jamie moved to Texas with high hopes of visiting Mexico. They frequently  listened to songs about Mexico and Tijuana prior to their move. They also heard   captivating stories from their friends of adventures across the border, magical donkey shows, and delicious tequila! Of course, they were also  forewarned about smuggling drugs back into the states and were told not to drink the water. With all of these mystical adventures and fanciful stories dancing around in their heads, you would think that Patrick and Jamie would have ventured immediately to the glorious borders of Mexico. Even from a distance, one would surely know of their incredulious nature: millions of lights dotting the border towns like an enchanting theme park that stretches for miles and miles. But alas, regardless of the many desires and yearnings to journey to the wonderful place that Mexico is...they failed to travel in that general direction. What a sad world it must be when two gentle souls, such as Patrick and Jamie's, cannot reach the fantastical perimeters of the land of Mex.  But this sad tale of woe does much improve. The fortunes of Patrick and Jamie are about improve...as they are moving to a wonderful place called California. And this grand land is only a hop, skip, and a jump from the boundaries of the ole Spanish land of Mexico ( well, a 8 hour drive ).  Much to their delight, it would still be possible for them to visit the musical, fragrant place that is...MEXICO!
