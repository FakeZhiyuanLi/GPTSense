      "Wah Piang Eh" a Singaporean phrase to replace the otherwise commonly used "Oh My God", is the subject heading of this post. The reason for the exclaimation? My good fren here, Ms Janet Ng has already written 74 blogs compared to my meagre contribution of 3 including this one. What can I say? If I dun already know her, I would have pretty much concluded that she writes for a living. If you had taken some time to read her blogs, you would wonder how she is able to write so much, with ease. It seems like writing a blog is second nature to her. Amazing....  With reference to my first blog, I mentioned that the reason of this blog thingy was to enable me to write as frequently as possible so that I can write as easily as I can gobble down a cheeseburger. (haha.. i'm a foodie by nature, hence the apt reference of myself to food).To side track a bit, my nick name is now fat boy affectionately called upon by none other than Ms Ng who never fails to taunt me abt my spare tyre that has been faithfully "protecting" my sensitive stomach.  Anyway, looks like I have to spend a little more time in here to achieve my aim of bettering my literary skills. My 3 posts simply pales in comparison. Either I start writing more or I gotta find some reason for her to stop writing at the speed of new Mcdonalds branch opening up. May I add that it is spreading in an alarming rate. Its been only a few weeks since I graduated and when I was back in school today to collect my transcript, Macdonalds is already in the canteen. Scary if u ask me! Go read the book FAST FOOD NATION if ur not convinced for the reason to be terrified.  Hmmm.. this posting dont make much sense huh? Who cares... haha... at least I have written something and the something has added one more post to my blog. hahahahhahha......

      What a excellent read this book was. Did I mention that it was at least size 16 and 2 lines spacing for each paragraph. For someone who dun really enjoy reading, with the exceptions of comics, pictorials and maybe some juicy gossips in some sleaze mags, I proudly add another book read to my list.   It took me less than an hour to complete the book which was centred about these 3 mice finding more cheese (if I remembered corectly). Words used are simple but powerful. Dr Spencer Johnson has brilliantly wrote a simple story to illustrate the complexity of the human behavior when faced with various situations. Examples of problems that the mice faced were highly applicable to what we often faced in life. A must read for those who spends too much time on work and too little on reflections.  My personal rating for the book 4/5.  Would have written a more detailed account of the book if not for the fact that I had read it some time last year. Always had problem remembering things, perhaps due to the small head I have. hahaha... Well, for those of you who have read the book and is so sibei heng to pop by, do leave a brief summary to assist in my recollection. If not, go ahead and post some nonsensical ramblings. Will return ur comments with some sarcasm (hope I still have wat it takes.. haha...) if I find the time.   So wait patiently for a suaning war if you bother to retaliate..!!! Muahhaha... for those non singaporeans who dun roger wat I wrote.. TOUGH LUCK!! hahah..

      Ahh... Finally another has "succumbed", as what my fren Edmund would have put it. Yes, finally I've decided to join the community of the Bloggers. I always wondered who would have so much time on their hands to create a postings, ranting about anything and everything under the sun that might had left a deep impression on him. Its like keeping a diary. An invasion of privacy could be infringed at any moment should it land in the hands of some Kaypo ass.   For me, blogging would not be the posting of events that are personal. Instead, I hope that I'll be able to post up book reviews religiously upon the completion of titles. In doing so, I hope to have pages of book summaries that would  refresh my memory should I need to recall some key concepts in a particular book. In a way, it would also allow me to keep practising the English language and prevent me from losing my litery skills. This first posting is a good start to what I hope to achieve in many books to come.   Thats all folks... Wait out for my first book!!! =)

      This  blog is with reference to pika's troubled philosophy blog no 75 titled "i was inspired"  In it, she mentioned that she was in awe abt her fren who started his own business and together with her gf has a event management company.   I feel that the word Entreprenuers is an over-rated word in singapore. U have a stall selling char kway teow, ur an entreprenuer. U set up a pushcart selling bookmarks, u automatically join the ranks of being an entreprenuer. Look.... Sim Wong Hoo is an entreprenuer, so is Elim Chew and Ron Sim. I'm not trying to undermine those who left their jobs and setting up their own business. After all, they fit perfectly fine into the description of one ;entreprenuer: someone who organizes a business venture and assumes the risk for it. Infact, Somehow being an entreprenuer has lost some of its prestige that was tagged to a person in the past. With due credit, I must admit tat often I envy these guys who dares to travel the road less treaded upon. Whether the biz succeeds or not, I find the experience of it all priceless.  So was i inspired after reading the blog? I would have to say no. But I'm certainly impressed at the fact tat they are doing something abt their future while still studying. I only realised the importance of it all after graduation. Which is now la.. abit late.. but its ok.. better late than never. At least I'm doing something abt my future now.   For the record, I'm enroling in the CEHA course and CFA programme maybe later when I'm more sound financially.   Shall end the blog prematurely here due to the incessant barage of my icq popups. till then... ciaoz
