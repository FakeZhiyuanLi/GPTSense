      On February 11th 2003, the Lufthansa-aircraft carries me to the newly built Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. Drowsy and jet-lagged as I am at this time, I enter the arrival hall. At least two hundred people are standing there, almost shouting to get in contact with the ones they are waiting for. People are holding name shields in their hands and one of them says ‘Johan Vaide’. The persons waiting for me are one female student and her boyfriend. These two escorted me to a guesthouse close to Fudan Daxue (Fudan University) . Approximately two days passed by and I was, finally, ready for going downtown.   Taking the overcrowded ‘up to date’ bus, number 934, from my apartment (we were relocated to an apartment a week after the arrival) in northeast Shanghai to Renmin Guangchang (People’s Square), the passengers including myself have the possibility to watch Chinese television. In a colourful and rapid concoction with commercials for new LG-mobiles, Knorr-soy sauces and L’Oreal-shampoos (one advertisement presented by the world famous Mainland Chinese actress Gong Li ), the channel provides daily domestic and international news, entertainment (music videos i.e. with predominately Hong Kong and Taiwanese artists) and cuisine programmes in Chinese. Looking out of the well-polished window, I can see new buildings – built in the 1990s – penetrating the sky, long tang housings  and taxi cars in different colours passing by. The traffic jam is substantial. On the left hand, Pudong Xingqu (The Pudong New Area) shows itself without any shyness. Pudong Xingqu, which has approximately twenty skyscrapers in different styles, is described as Shanghai’s and extensively China’s economic powerhouse. It is an incredible, futuristic and fascinating view. For example, the 420-meter tall Jin Mao, which was built after inspiration from the traditional Chinese pagoda  disappears dramatically into the grey fog. 	    The urban landscape of Shanghai is rapidly changing, old long tang houses are demolished and shopping malls, apartment blocks and offices are constructed. Sitting down in the bus, after a forty minutes ride, the loudspeaker declares, not in the Shanghainese dialect but in Standard Chinese, ‘Renmin Guangchang dao le’ (We have arrived at People’s Square). The bus arrives gently to its destination.   As I leave the bus, Shanghai Bowuguan (Shanghai Museum) and hundreds of different-styled individuals at once face me. The camel-coloured and enormous building evokes the ancient Chinese history. The museum is a reproduction of an ancient three-legged food vessel. In its nearest environment, I can lay my eyes on sky-high modern buildings and large commercial billboards primarily in Chinese. Surprisingly as it may seem, the sense of tranquillity emerges in me.   Departing from one of the larger roads, such as Yanan Dong Lu, Shanghai is a quite different city. Just some minutes stroll from Renmin Guangchang, a variety of people are offering me food for 5 Jiao  and illegal CDs and VCDs for 10 Yuan each. I am in a neighbourhood where the housings are low, the streets are more narrow, and the scrubbed laundry is hanged out through the windows and balconies – a Shanghai that is hitherto untouched by the end of the 20th century.

      The project attempts to examine the new urban spaces and places that have emerged in post 1992 Shanghai. Due to economic structural reforms initiated in 1978 and 1992 respectively, the city’s semi-colonial landscape has changed radically. The Shanghai landscape has experienced an explosive development and renewal in its infrastructure and built environment. Simultaneously, new urban identities have been constructed. As a point of departure, the study deals with questions concerning urban change, “negotiations of place” and new urban identities.  	 The aim of the project is twofold. Firstly, I’m seeking to understand how the cultural changes are present and manifested in built environment. To describe the changes in built environment it is crucial to apply a historic-sociological perspective. Significant themes are the preservation of the buildings built by British, French and Americans colonizers in 19th and 20th century, the destruction of old neighbourhoods and the relocation of citizens to different parts of the city. Significantly, the study deals with the issue of cultural identity in contemporary Shanghainese architecture. How are the old colonial buildings reused and renewed in 21st century Shanghai? Furthermore, Shanghai Municipal Government and Shanghai Urban Planning Commitee play key roles in the development of the city. Therefore is the material published by these two controlling bodies important to examine. Secondly, the project attempts to analyse young citizens’ (20s-30s) orientation in and experiences of the new spaces and places. New markers of “gender” (norms, values, customs), “class” (an arising middle class) and “ethnicity” (the rural-urban divide) have been formulated. A generational perspective will give the analysis a strength. What do the eldery think of the new Shanghai? Moreover, shopping malls, bars, restored old houses, restaurants, cinemas, clubs and concert halls are part of the new urban landscape that has emerged. What are these spaces and places like, and how do the young citizens act in them? How can the analysis be related to Shanghainese history and theories on negotiations of place? Specifically, I’m striving to examine how the young citizens perceive their Shanghainese tradition, and how they construct their identities in this new urban landscape.   Methodologically, the project will make use of  participant observation, textual analysis of official materials, interviews with young citizens, eldery, personnel and managers at several bars, boutiques, restaurants and clubs. I’m also attempting to interview the staff at Shanghai Municipal Government and Shanghai Urban Planning Committee since these bodies are the ones that determine what is going to happen with the city.   Keywords: Shanghai, urban change, new identities, cultural globalisation, negotiations of place, place promotion, new places and spaces, economic structural reforms, Chineseness

      Tanken med denna blog är att jag ska sätta ord på de om än spretiga funderingar som jag har om Shanghai, arkitektur, postkolonialism, offentliga rum, storstäder, förhandlingar om plats/rum, genuskonstruktioner, självrepresentationer, kinesisk modernitet och så vidare.
