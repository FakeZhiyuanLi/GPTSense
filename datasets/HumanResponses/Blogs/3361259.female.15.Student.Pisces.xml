Almost missed the bus again :) Im thinking of shaving all my hair of then i dont need to spend an hour doing it every morning.maybe....maybe..... so nothing really to say. some people are so stupid. when u have a bf and you never do all the coupley shit they give u crap about not looking like ur a couple. when u do all the coupley shit they're still complete morons. sigh.

      Well here i am starting this thing. Mostly because I'm so bored. I don't even know if anyone will read this or if i'll want them to or whatever. So school's going to be finished soon. I cant believe it. Seems like I was just freaking out about starting highschool and wondering if anyone would like me. Insane. Im actually not really looking forward to the summer. call me wierd. Getting away from the actual school work will be nice but I don't even know if im going to get to see my friends really. I don't have a job and I don't have any idea where I should apply. So basically its probably gonna be a lonley/boring summer for me. At least I'll get a sexy tan while im doing it. lol. So yeah...... im supposed to be organizing my thoughts. This weekend was pretty boring. I went to danielle's after school on friday and we saw the play yet again. Its really amazing. So that was lot of fun. Then on Saturday I made this game for English. I hope i get a good mark on it. It took waaay to much time. Well I guess that's all i have to say for the moment. Got school tomorrow so i should go get all my crap ready for that. tootles

      sooo its 7:33 PM Monday. SLEPT IN till 6:45. wow lucky me. getting up for school really sucks. Then I almost missed the bus. THe worst place to be. Never knew the little children could be so annoying. The only good part of it all is when me and jenn scare that one boy into believing that we're actually in love with him. lmao. Yeah so I got a 71 on my bible essay which is really gay. That man doesnt know good shit when he sees it. Guess I wasted that saturday for nothing. So stupid. I wish I could just drop the class altogether. but whatever. All I want to do right now is crawl into my bed. Things just seem to be getting worse and worse. Oh well.Only 17 more day till Prisoner of Azkaban comes out. I cant wait. Im probably going to go see it with Jenn. Loads and loads of fun!!! That is if I actually have any money to go. :S i really really neeed a job. Anyone got one for me?? :S Im not really looking forward to see Fat Man (old prinicpal) at market in the summer time. The whole staring and telling me to smile thing sickens me.I dont think i'll ever hate anyone as much as I hate that man.I have yet to decide which is worse is looks or personality.
