      Ok-its 4:10, well, 4:11 according to blogger, but anyway-this day has been absolutely f-ing endless--endless--I kind of want to scream. Today at work has really been no different than any other, but for some reason I feel like I am trapped in a place where the time doesn't move. All I can think about is running out of here and doing a little shopping for something cute to wear this weekend--not that I have any special plans, but hey, I deserve it. . .simply for putting up with this job!!! I also can't wait to eat a yummy steak salad (sorry pork) and drink some wine--but that is a given--a night without a glass of wine is like a pizza without cheese. Well, actually, I often have beers instead of wine--love those Sam Summer's, so, I guess a night withought a drink, beer or wine, is like a pizza without cheese. Although now that I think about it, I have had pizza without cheese, and its pretty good--but I do like the cheese and can't think of a better analogy-perhaps I should go down the hall and get one from the analogy master M---sorry to keep putting you in my posts by the way. . .but I guess I see you more than I see anyone else (40 hours--well, a little less a week, right?) anyhoo-I am rambling now-just wanted to get an entry in before the weekend--although my computer at home is back to normal-so maybe i'll have more to write later.  PS--my interview went really well--perhaps I am one step closer to obtaining a job that I don't want to run screaming from.  With that said--HAPPY WEEKEND TO ME AND YOU!

      Ok-so, I know I haven't written in a while. . . A , I have actually been semi-busy at work, and  2 , I don't feel like I have anything that exciting to write about.&nbsp; This is exactly what happens when it comes to journals&nbsp;and me--I write and write and bitch and bitch, but, when everything is going pretty good, I tend to leave that stuff out by not bothering to write about it.&nbsp; I guess its natural to wanna vent about stuff that is negative rather than positive.   Anyhoo-I must be feeling some guilt about not writing on a subconscious level.&nbsp; Last night I actually dreamed that I felt bad about not writing, so I took entries from another blog (that was mine) and added them to this one.&nbsp; WHAT???? Yeah-pretty pathetic-I know.&nbsp; So, I guess I will try to write more so I can have more exciting dreams at night.&nbsp; I am actually a really heavy dreamer and usually remember&nbsp;most of&nbsp;them, but, I would&nbsp;rather have fun ones to remember--like me hooking up with Randy from the Real World.&nbsp; I have a lot of Randy dreams--kind of weird-he is cute and all, but, I don't know why I keep dreaming about him. . .hmmmm.   Well, I have a job interview today (please lord, get me outta this place) so I need to prep for that.&nbsp; Isn't that the best use of&nbsp;my company's time. . .hee hee.&nbsp; I actually get paid to look for other jobs!!! I guess that is the only good thing about this place--which I have&nbsp;my equally miserable co-worker&nbsp;to thank for reminding me of over and over again.&nbsp; Oh-I also have to thank her for turning me on to  urlLink Reef  flip-flops.&nbsp; I used to think that I just had the wrong type of feet for flip-flops and would be envious and full of wonder at how so many girls seem to wear them with ease.&nbsp; BUT, its not my feet--it was just the type of flip-flops I was wearing--Reef's fit my feet perfect-I no longer have to use a death grip to keep the flops on my feet, especially when going up stairs--say good bye to those days!!!! Its now gonna be all flip-flops all the time-I just can't take them off my feet (and just to think,&nbsp;I thought they never wanted to be on my feet--boy was I wrong). Well, that's it for now--wish me luck on the job front!

      Alright--its Friday, 3:30 ish, almost time to leave work behind for the weekend--not exactly sure what I am up to, but, as long as I am not working I dont care! I wanna B-line to the pack-ee and grab some vino and sit on my deck and catch the last rays of the day. . .yeah, that sounds really good.&nbsp; Hopefully Old Mother Hubbard (our bitchy, busy-body next door neighbor) isnt out and trying to catch my roommates and&nbsp;I swear--heaven forbid a couple of twentsomething ladies relax and talk after work, and use the occasional F-bomb! F-her! No, we really try to watch it, but, swearing is a natural part of speaking, especially with people in your comfort zone---but apparently is makes you an evil whore too--Old Mother Hubbard is not a part of our fanclub.&nbsp; Ah well. I think we have enough friends anyway.&nbsp;   Well, thats about all I got left in me to write-just kinda wanted to write a little something before the weekend--I cant really write from home because our Internet is slow as shit--and its supposedly high speed--Verizon is not my friend.&nbsp; So, until Monday.&nbsp; Oh yeah--Go Red Sox!!!

      Ok-so, its been a bit of a shitty day.&nbsp; For starters, I got really upset with my boyfriend last night, and he had no idea why. . .why, when I explain something does it still go understood (no hun, its not what you said, its that nasty cold tone in which you said it)?? He really hurt my feelings and had no clue that he had done so--that brings me to the idea of chick chips.&nbsp; Chick chips would be the single best invention ever.&nbsp; It would be a special micro-chip inserted into the brains of men.&nbsp; This would give&nbsp;them chick-like abilities such as knowing when&nbsp;they&nbsp;are being mean or hurting someone else's feelings as well as the ability to "just know" that owning just one bath towel is simply unacceptable.&nbsp; Unfortunately computer science is not my thing, but, maybe there is hope--it all starts with an idea, right?!   Secondly--I still despise my job.&nbsp; The first thing I did when I got in today was answer a phone call from an angry provider.&nbsp; She is very upset about the way my company is treating her, and, for the record, I cant say I blame her, BUT, please spare me all the details--you know that I cannot help you, so stop going on and on and on.&nbsp; I dont care if you want to get militant and file a legal complaint--be my guest-but, no matter what you say, you still know I have no power and cannot help you--in fact, I don't even know how to help you--I am very low on the totem poll--so leave me the hell alone!!!   Boy, that felt good.&nbsp; Well, that's about it for now--but as far as later goes I am checking out my friend's band  urlLink Logan --they really rock-so, I am sure that'll be fun and brighten up my night.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Ok--Just thought I'd waste the last 15 minutes in the work day blogging.&nbsp; I am off to the gym with my co-worker&nbsp;  urlLink M  in a little bit.&nbsp; I am taking our favorite instructor Kate's class.&nbsp; She is fun and slightly insane (she really wants to be Madonna-kind of in a scary obsessed type way) so it makes the class fly by--before you know it you have worked every muscle in your body! Thanks Kate!!  &nbsp;  But, I must say, I really would rather dive into a pizza than go to the gym right now--so very hungry due to my lunch troubles.&nbsp; I went to my favorite Deli, J. Pace, to get cold cuts (yes Ham) as I do every week, BUT, after waiting at the counter for 10 minutes they told me that I had to come back after 2:00 because they were short staffed---aaaagh!! They weren't even busy.&nbsp; Well, that pissed me off so I wasn't about to go back there (of course I'll be back next week I am sure), so I go to another favorite spot of my for a super indulgent chicken cutlet foccaccia bread sandwich with mozzarella and tomatoes--it is so good I was actually glad that the deli wouldn't give me my damn meat.&nbsp; I walk in salivating only to find out that they were out of the foccaccia bread---The absolute BEST part of the sandwich, seriously, best foccaccia ever!!!! They tried to talk me into a French roll, or Bulkie roll instead, but, I wasn't having it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, I guess I was destined to not have a good lunch today--I wasn't about to go to a 3rd place.&nbsp; Instead, I had a bowl of Kashi cereal, which I also had for breakfast---its good and all, but not for 2 meals a day. . .and, it didn't quite fill me up like it claims to--I am starving!!!!!!! So, with that said--its gym time--Bye!

      OK-so what is the deal with this weather?? It is July 20th right??Where is the sunshine that I long for?? It is impossible to get out of bed when it is dark and gloomy out, which it has been so far this week and all of last week, except for Friday--one sunny morning in the past 7 work days--well, that's just not good enough Mama Nature, perhaps you need an assistant, I am currently seeking new employment!! I will be your sidekick, Senorita Sunny, whaddaya say???  &nbsp;  No, but seriously, I do not remember ever having such a dull and chilly summer.&nbsp; I feel like that carefree and lazy attitude that I once associated with June-August, is gone.&nbsp; And when I say gone, I mean gone from everyone, not just lil' old me.&nbsp; Ah well, what to do. . .just a little rant and a plea for a new job (M. Nature, if you happen to be into blog reading, drop me an email, K?)

      OK--Its 2 hours away from the end of this work day--which hasn't been too bad considering I'd rather eat glass than be&nbsp;in this office.&nbsp; I swear to god, I have been to funerals that are more exciting than this place. . .but, then again, I am Irish.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyhoo, I wasnt sure what to title this post due to my newbie blogging, so, I decided to put what I was eating in the title (well, only the ham is food for me, the other I'll get to.) Yes, back to ham. . .I absolutely have a penchant for pork.&nbsp; I could eat a ham and cheese sandwhich every single day, which I would if I was better about walking my ass to the grocery store.&nbsp; I also love ham dinners, which I would eat more of if I&nbsp;was better about walking&nbsp;my ass to the grocery store (and if I knew how to cook one...actually, I do make a mean hamsteak, but that is so different).&nbsp; And, I just realized that almost everytime I go out to dinner I end up with a pork dish. . .pork chops and apple sauce, stuffed pork tenderloins, so on and so forth. . .  &nbsp;  As for the apple bag part, I decided to put that in because its&nbsp;a term thats&nbsp;been making me laugh all day--not sure if anyone else would find it so funny, but then again, I am extremely easily amused.&nbsp; Anyway, I was laying on my boyfriend yesterday and he asked me to watch out for&nbsp;his apple bag.&nbsp; For those of you (if there are any of you) who don't get it--he was referring to his nuts!!! Well, I don't know why, but when he said that I absolutely lost it--I had never heard that term before.&nbsp; I was in the movie theater last night and I was still hysterically laughing about it. . .and this was several hours later. . .and even now, i am still cracking up.&nbsp; Apparently those kind of apples can bruise too. . .  &nbsp;  Well, thats all for the moment--I actually have some work to do.&nbsp; Bye for now.

      OK-here goes.&nbsp; I barely even know what a blog is, and apparently I am starting my own.&nbsp; How did this happen you ask?? Well, I have a job that I absolutely despise, and fortunately, one of my 3 other co-worker's   urlLink M   (the only sane one I might add) has recently started blogging herself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After looking at her newly&nbsp;created blog I figured I would hop on the bandwagon, plus, it will give me something to do in between obsessively checking my personal email accounts and reading  urlLink Craigslist  (what can I say, I get paid to do nothing--but believe me, &nbsp;I would rather be working hard, I swear--I am a Capricorn worker bee, its in my nature).  &nbsp;  Anyhoo,  The funny thing about this blog thing is that I have such a hard time putting my thoughts on paper, or in this case, a computer screen.&nbsp; Seriously, I usually need 14 different opinions when drafting a simple thank you card.&nbsp; Ah well, maybe this will actually help me become a better written communicator,&nbsp;or not, we'll see.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, it seems that I could go on forever, but, I wanna see what else I can do in this blog land.&nbsp; So, until my next post. . .

      Oh my god--finally, another weekend!! Does anyone really like the weekdays? I know by Tuesday I am already longing for Friday. I think that even if I had a job I loved going to everyday (does anyone??) I still would be living for the weekends. . .just the way life is I guess.  Well, today kind of sucked. I sat in this ofice by myself for about 3 hours this morning. Can you believe I am in an office in downtown Boston that has more empty offices than full ones? Only 3 out of the 10 are occupied, and then there is me--I dont get an office even though there are sooo many of them. Wanna know why-I am supposed to be here ready to greet that 1 person that walks into this office a month. Yeah--we get no visitors (even though we are supposed to be an office that people come into for counseling). Sometimes I find myself wishing the little Asian plant watering lady or the toothless tobacco infested coffee guy would come in. I guess the only regular visitor we get is the mailman--good thing he is nice and funny. . .oh, there is Steve the UPS man too. . . But I kid you not--this is my life. A quiet and lonely cold office in a dark corner of a hallway. I wonder if the other floors in this building are this quiet?? Hmm.  Wait--interuption from that thought. I just found out I am going to the Sox game tonight--for free. Some guy on Craigslist posted an ad in the tickets section saying that he was giving a pair of tix away to any girls that email him saying they wanna go--well, that is me and C, we figured why not email him and see what happens. . .well, he emailed C back and said to meet him. We are going to have a beer with this guy and get tix out of the deal--sweeeeeet. I am excited. . .I hope this guy is cool (although I sound really uncool admitting that I am meeting a stranger for sox tix, BUT, there are two of us--safety first!). I'll let ya know how it goes. Also, we are going to the game tomorrow too--C got tix from work. Nice--Weekend of Baseball--awesome. I haven't gone to a game all season, and now I am going to two for free. I guess when it rains it pours!!!!!!  Ok-I gotta go home now that my plans have changed. Until Monday. . .

      Yup--I am not good at keeping up with the blog, I admit it. Well, as for the past weekend, it was a lot of fun. I went to Suffolk Downs for the first time with  D  and  A  and her boyfriend  M . Actually, it was my first time at any horse track. I was a winner too--yup, I won $4. 40. Woo-hoo. None of us brought home the bacon-- A  would have won $125.00 but  M  didn't see her bet written on the betting sheet, so he didn't put it in, and of course, as you might guess, all the horses came in--in order. He felt really bad--but, it was an accident and we all had fun anyways. It's a great place to people watch too. . .I am sure you can imagine the lovely mix of fellow gamblers.  After the track we got some yummy pub-grub at the Beer Garden, went back to my place and hung out for a bit, and then went bowling at King's. I can't remember the last time I went bowling, it was so much fun. I just hope no one catches a foot fungus, as none of us wore socks with our shoe rentals (we all had flip-flops and sandals on). One funny thing about bowling is watching other people bowl. . .did you ever notice how everyone seems to have their own signature moves?? I know for me I kick my leg back after I let the ball go,  M  would put his hand out to the side and do some sort of wave, and so on. . .but of course its only funny because we are completely unaware that we are doing it. hee hee.  Let's see, after King's we got last call at Bukowski's and then headed back to Southie and stayed up a while--boozin of course.  It was a lot of fun, and everyone got along really well, especially  M  and  D . I love how two guys can instantly bond as long as they each have basic sports knowledge and know a few funny lines from the latest TV comedies.  As for today, its only Tuesday, and so far not a very exciting one. Actually it's all together crappy. First my interview was rescheduled---boo! Now even if I do get the job it means that its an extra couple days I spend here treading water. Seriously, I am almost drowning in boredom and misery--and, my co-worker  M -is going to Italy, leaving me alone with the other 2 crazies that work here-D'oh!

      Ok--a few things struck me funny last night.  1st--I took my usual Tuesday night gym class with crazy Kate. Well, it was the same old class. Lots of weights and step with the usual core training/yoga type cool down. Well, the cool down is my least favorite part. Wanna know why? Well, if I wanted to take yoga I would take yoga. . .and if I did take yoga I might know what the hell Kate is talking about when she asks us to get into random animal positions. "OK everyone, now get into the partial camel position." What the hell is a partial camel?? And how the hell am I supposed to partial camel if I have to turn my head to look at you to see what a partial camel is???? Do I need to start studying yoga before I go to my upbeat muscle sculpting class? "And now the downward-dog, raging-bull, praying mantis. . ." Yeah--sure I'll whip that move right out for you.  2nd--What is the deal with lighters or what I call the lighter cycle? I think I can honestly say that I have never bought a lighter in my life, but, I always seem to have at least 5 of them at any given time. But, it does seem that once in a while you will get down to one, or maybe not have one for a day, but then before you know it BOOM you have a whole NEW batch of lighters. Instead of the ones you used to think were yours, you now have one that says Nascar, one with a fish, a cheapie that says Store 24, one advertising Biff's Clamshack or another place you have never been to or heard of in your entire life, and don't forget the random plain colors that you come across as well. Like, "has anyone seen my red lighter?" Now we all know it's never really been  your  red lighter, after all,  you  didn't buy it, but it seems once you've had it for a week or so it suddenly becomes  YOUR  red lighter. So, lets see, I will look in my purse right now and see what I got going on for a lighter stash. . .and then compare next week--will I be able to hold on to them, or will I abscond a new batch of lighters while someone else absconds mine??? Only time will tell.

      Alrighty, just another "check-in" post. Still busy with printing things at work. . .seriously, I didn't go to Northeastern for 5 years and work all of those co-op jobs just to hit print on a shitty little piece of shit color printer--For the love of God, please shoot me and put me out of my misery. Aaaagh. And if my crazy ass co-worker doesn't stop coming up to my desk with this "woe is me" talk I am gonna loose it. Basically--Just tell me what you need from me and slowly back away from the desk--MY desk--move it or loose it (actually, she has lost it long ago)!!!!! Anyway--had to get that out!!!  I just hope I can tell my boss that I have had it with this place very very very soon (of course I will be tactful and thank her so much for this piece of crap job opportunity--but I envision being mean--it's a much more fun daydream)!!! I had a second interview today and it went really, really, well!!!! Everytime I answered a question I kept getting a "good answer" response. I felt like I was winning the pot on the Family Feud!!! So, yes, it went well, I will keep my fingers crossed, starting right after I type this post!  Sidebar--The printer is running out of ink and now I have to print all this stuff over!!!!!! Man--I must need to do something to improve my karma--aaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggghhhhhhhhh! (Perhaps stop talking smack about the people I work with!)  ok--anyways. I am gonna eat my pear and say ciao for now.

      Ok-well, not much to write about, but, I don't want blogger guilt to kick in, so, here goes. Today was a hell of a lot better than yesterday. I feel like a new woman. I am no longer stressed about my Sunday night actions and my crazy sleep stages, I feel really good. Work sucks, but that is a given. I have made so many photocopies today that I think that I could be employee of the month if I worked for Kinko's. But, I guess the good thing is that the photocopier actually worked today, whereas yesterday it was very tempermental and I just wanted to throw things at it or light it on fire. Well, that's all for now. Hopefully something intereting will happen so I can write about it tomorrow. Peace.

      Well, Monday again--sweet, sweet, lovely little Monday-right!!! Today was a pretty rough one for me. I woke up to my boyfriend asking me if I remembered all of the mean things I said to him last night--which I don't!! I think I was just sleep talking--I tend to babble when I am sleepy from drinking. . .but apparently I said crazy and mean things to him--I kind of remember laying down and half dreaming while awake--I kept thinking there were a lot of people in my room even though there was no one...so I remember that crazy talk, but that's all. I don't know, I feel like I always end up in really strange sleep stages. So much sometimes that I often confuse dreams with reality...if only for a second, but still, its enough to make me think. I also used to sleep walk too--that's' super scary. But I haven't done that in a couple years-thank god-waking up at 4am in your pajamas a block away from your house--not so fun!!  Anyhoo-yesterday was really fun until my madness began. I hung out with D, my roomies, and my neighbors who live upstairs--they are really cool guys (well, most of them are cool, there is one dude we call "porn guy" due to his actions about a year or so ago--I was sitting on his bed after a night out and out of no where he put on porn and asked me if it gave me any ideas, I was like yeah-run, no but seriously though--at the time it was a neighbor I had just met about a week before, so I think that is sleazy and inappropriate--but he wasn't there yesterday anyway)---it was nice to hang out on the deck and drink beers and get to know each other a bit. Actually-we may have hung out with them sooner or more often-but C used to date one of them, and it looks like they may start dating again--maybe the third time is a charm??? We'll see.  Well, that's it for now--I am still kind of out of it--later.
