      The world was on fire and no one could save me but you. It's strange what desire will make foolish people do. I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you. And I never dreamed that I knew somebody like you.  No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) With you. With you. (This world is only gonna break your heart)  What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way. What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you. What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way. What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and,  I want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) No, I want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) With you.  The world was on fire and no one could save me but you. It's strange what desire will make foolish people do. I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you. And I never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you no,  No, I want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) No, I want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart) With you. (This world is only gonna break your heart) With you. (This world is only gonna break your heart) No, I... (This world is only gonna break your heart) (This world is only gonna break your heart)  Nobody loves no one.

      Now and then I'm scared, when I seem to forget how sounds become words or even sentences ... No, I don't speak anymore and what could I say, since no-one is there and there is nothing to say ...  So, I prefer to lie in darkest silence alone ... listening to the lack of light, or sound, or someone to talk to, for something to share ...- but there is no hope and no-one is there.  No, no, no ...- not one living soul and there is nothing (left) to say, in darkness I lie all alone by myself, sleeping most of the time to endure the pain.  I am not breathing a word, I haven't spoken for weeks and yet the mistress inside me is (secretly) straining her ears. But there is no-one, and it seems to me at times that with every passing hour another word is leaving my mind ...  I am the mistress of loneliness, my court is deserted but I do not care. The presence of people is ugly and cold and something I can neither watch nor bear.  So, I prefer to lie in darkness silence alone, listening to the lack of light, or sound, or someone to talk to, for something to share ...- but there is no hope and no-one is there.  No, I don't speak anymore and what should I say, since no- one is there and there is nothing to say? All is oppressive, alles ist schwer, there is no-one and NO-ONE IS THERE ...  ihiiihih waduh waduh kunaon nyakk...hihihih dugcretssss wow waw
