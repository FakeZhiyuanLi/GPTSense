      Wow.  I havent written in my journal for a long time...  Today will be rough.  I have a project due tomorrow that I never started yet.  Its about a 37 Chapter Book we are reading in class and I only read one chapter. Great.  To top all that, I got a lot of homework to do.  Next time I should pay attention in Ms Murphys bio class. I hate that bitch. We are disecting frogs on wednesday.  I dont know who the fuck thought of disecting animals but whoever did should be shot.. 9 times. lol. I make jokes too ya' know. :-P  I am going down to my beach house in seaside memorial weekend.  That will be sweet as hell.  I need to get tan but knowing me I'll get whiter down there. Now, to top off the rest of my day... My computer is a piece of shit.  I need to get a new one. lol.  Seriously, I might just restart everything because I got some  spyware  on my computer that messes up everything.   Yes.. Melissa.. I will remember your CD!   Finally. LoL.  After 2 or 3 weeks. lol.  My subprofile should be updates soon with another graphic.  Check it out.

      Nice.  Its almost the end of Thursday which means Friday is almost here. :).  I love Fridays.  Today was a boring day.  I have a test in every subject tomorrow, and most likely I will fail them all.  I cant fail English so I am really going to study.  I also have an English project due Tuesday, which I didnt start on.  I got in trouble today.  It was funny though.  8th period my English class went down to the art show.  Braulio was leaving the show and Ricky was going to go also.  A bunch of kids were out in the courtyard, so I went.  When Ms. Murphy (My English Teacher) wasnt looking, Ricky left.   A few minutes later, she noticed he was gone.  She was writing him up saying that he cut class. (Speaking of cutting, I cut 1st period today).  Brian tried to cover Ricky up by saying he was in the courtyard.  She couldnt find them there.  I go back out in the courtyard and I was like "Oh! Ricky is in the tress.  It hard to see him but hes there."  She got pissed off at me. lol.  I keep fucking forgetting melissas cd in my room.  Shit.  Dont worry babe.  Ill remember sooner or later.

      Wow.  This has to be the worst fucking day of my life.  Shit happened in school that I hated, but Ill let that go by.  I just found out that one of my good friends died (Not from Jersey).  The kid was like a brother to me. :'(.  I still cant believe it.  I am in shock right now.  R.I.P.  Chris.  Please, if you see me online, try to cheer me up.  I need someone to talk to that isnt an ass.

      I can tell that today will be a long day.  I have so much damn homework to do that I have to do.  I am failing English and I might go to summer school if I fail this marking period, so I have to bring my grades up.  Hopefully I dont fail so I can go to Europe this summer. So I have to work all night.  For some reason, my whole body was soar today.  I dont know, but lately I have been active in gym.  Maybe thats why?  I kicked ass in hockey and basketball for 2 days straight.  Thats never happened to me before because I am always on the bleachers sleeping in that class.  I was as surprised as they were.  Exams are coming up and I might fail those. Heh.  Ill try to make it to next year though.  I want to graduate in '06.. Thats my year. :)  I have been slacking off on music lately.  I was supposed to give Melissa's CD to her last week on this day.  I never did.  I put it in my CD to see if it worked and it didnt, so I would have given her a blank CD anyways.  I guess I have to remake it.    Sorry babe. xoxo. ;)  Yea, well, Im off.  I might update it some more later.

      Damn.  This day is boring as hell.  School went by quick, boring as always.  I come home and cleaned all day because my mom is a bitch.  I go on the internet and nobody besides Matt is on. =/.  No one I really like.  I guess I will just work on some homework and do nothing.
