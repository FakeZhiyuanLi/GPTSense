       Keeps Owner From Sleeping, Claims She Is 'Neglected'    Los Angeles, CA  - Gandalf the Grey, seeking vengeance for punishment received after the infamous 'PDA Incident,' conspired with roommate Phoebe "Boo" Kit-Kit to keep their owner from sleeping last night.    "Look, all I want to do is spend some time playing with my owner.  She finally comes home at 10 pm last night, throws some food in the bowl to appease us, and takes off again.  I mean, we didn't even get a hello/goodbye pat on the head!  She deserved what she got," claimed Gandalf.  Strategies employed by the two cats included playing with toys in close proximity to owner's head, toe biting, and hair pulling.  But the true work of art for the night took planning on the part of both cats.  Gandalf explained, "Well, Phoebe coughed up this monster hairball in the bathroom.  I knew that if I lured our owner in there at 5 am there was no way she'd be awake enough to clean it up.  And that she might even step in it!"  Their plan worked brilliantly.  While Gandalf was being carried to the bathroom for 5 - 7 am lockup, her owner nearly stepped in the hairball.  Since she couldn't determine what it was on only 1 hour of sleep, the owner decided against locking Gandalf in with the gross blob and instead suffered through two more hours of biting and hair pulling.  The night of revenge ended at approximately 7 am when the owner's alarm went off.  Gandalf took that as a sign to curl up on her owner's neck and act cute so that the owner could not sleep, reach the snooze button, or get out of bed.  Plans to prosecute the kit-kits are on hold pending a hearing at tonight's feeding.

       Aquarius    January 20 - February 17 Don't get sad if no one is laughing at your jokes today, dear Aquarius. This doesn't mean that you aren't funny; it just means that people may not be in the mood to laugh. Ridiculous as it may seem, today is simply a better day to cry. Let all your pent up emotions out on the table. Talk it out with the people around you. Your heart is communicating well through you today.   This just be wrong.  Pirates don't cry.   EVER.   Well, maybe at the occasional Hallmark Commercial.

       Kitten swears that God told her PDA would lead to the destruction of the universe if she didn't destroy it.    Los Angeles, CA   The drama of Virtual WCM's missing PDA came to a startling conclusion at approximately 10:30 pm PST last night.  After two hours of rigorous house cleaning, multiple phone calls crying to parents and a severe bout of paranoia, Virtual WCM located her missing PDA in the strangest of places - high atop her bookshelf, seemingly out of reach.    When she confronted Gandalf about how the PDA came to be on the bookshelf, she was startled by the kitten's frank confession.  "Listen. God told me that if I didn't destroy the PDA it would take over the world's computers and turn into a giant Rosie O'Donnell-like amorphous blob.  I didn't want that to happen.  So I took the PDA and hid it from you.  I was all set to knock the PDA off the bookshelf, destroying it forever, when I had second thoughts.  I knew that you would never think to look there, so I just told God that I had destroyed it and left it alone.  Can I have some tuna now?"  Appeased, Virtual WCM let Gandalf off the hook, although she did withhold canned food until morning.  "I just don't understand what makes Gandalf think that God is talking to her," mused Virtual WCM, "I mean, does she think that because she's named after a wizard she can really do magic?"  We may never know.

But it stuck.  And since I want to remain anonymous, you're all stuck with it too.

      So I got this wonderful shiny special does anything you could ever imagine and then some palm pilot for Christmas.  Which I promptly lost or had stolen this weekend (ransacking of my apartment for determination pending).  All I know is right now I have a case and accessories but no palm pilot.  BOO.  So other than throwing a nice chunk of change out the window, what has this cost me?  bank account - account info in handy money management program.  must close current accounts and open new one.  bank account 2 - use handy money management program to balance checkbook. have NO IDEA how much is outstanding and therefore NO IDEA how much is  really  left in the bank.  sanity - barely hanging on by a thread.  miscellaneous - saved files, personal info, commplete life schedule, handy program that tells me what restaurants I should be eating at.  CONCLUSION:  handy palm pilot - $450 software - $30 extra storage card - $60 having your whole life in a little computer - priceless.   Garrrr.

      Avast! Go see Dodgeball or I'll be makin' ya walk the plank.   If you like pirates (and, hey, who doesn't these days?), this is the movie for you. There's some silly subplot about rival gyms, a dodgeball tournament, and Ben Stiller's package, but at the forefront is a charming story of a young man coming to terms with his identity as a pirate. Learn and grow with Steve as he realizes that he has to be true to himself, and that no matter what you look like on the outside, if you feel like a pirate on the inside you have to make this noise every 30 seconds: "Arrrrrrrrr." Hell, Steve, we could have told you that. Like any good pirate story, and I'm not really giving much away here, Steve receives his booty in the end.   I only hope that all the "Steves" out there find some strength and hope in this film. You are not alone!!   **Here's where I'd do an ASCII graphic of a skull & crossbones if I had 17 hours.**  May the wind always be at your back, and your rum bottle always be full.

      I be stealin' this poem from Craigslist DC, as pirates are wont to do. So, thanks anonymous funny Craigslister. You be much more entertain' than I. And your humor be applyin' to all interns everywhere. Avast.   Ode to Interns  Oh, interns, how I hate ye  You are so very stupid   At my job, you sit near me  You get yelled at  For being stupid  But today you have brought  Your dad  To work  You are introducing him  Like a total douchebag   You are the worst things  to happen to Washinton  Since Panda-mania  (you are even more useless)   You roam the streets of Georgetown  Like a horde of wild animals  Last night at a stop sign  I had to wait 10 minutes  For 100 of you to cross  With your stupid Lush bags  You might also shop at  Commander Salamander  What are you,  In high school?   The fourth of July  Will be the worst intern day  In the history of stupid interns  They will take the metro  To the mall, which will be near  Their stupid Hill office buildings   Oh interns, you are so stupid  I bet you have never even  Heard of Wonkette   I have three words for you   Go fuck yourselves     I be returnin' shortly with another sabre rattlin' rant about...somethin' else pirates hate. Yo ho.

       urlLink     photo courtesy of  urlLink espn  &nbsp; urlLink     Please don't leave Duke.  You are an institution at Duke.  Every year you introduce a new class of freshmen to the wonder that is college basketball.  You teach us how to be a community, how to bring all majors together in support of one interest, how to be a  family .  You instill both students and team with an overwhelming amount of pride in our school.  You bring alumni together at least twice a year to watch Duke battle Carolina.  You have built a basketball program and a team that engenders such loyalty that alumni come back, year after year, even if it is just to see Duke play an exhibition game.  You have been there for some of the momentous memories of my life.  You were there when Duke defeated Carolina for the first time in my college career, sophomore year.  You were there (ok, maybe just on screen) when my heart broken for Trajan Langdon when Duke lost to UConn in 1999 and I watched in tears from your beloved Cameron Indoor Stadium.  You were there in 2000 at the Georgia Dome when Duke defeated Maryland for the third time that season.  You were even there for the highlight of last year's Christmas vacation - a trek to Cameron to watch Duke easily defeat Davidson.  I just can't imagine Duke basketball without you.  I feel sorry for the future basketball players that would be robbed of your tutelage and guidance.  You've kept many players in school even when they knew their careers would benefit from leaving school early for the NBA.  You're part of what makes college basketball so much more exciting than the NBA.    Please don't desert us.  We've always looked up to you and honored you.  It would break our hearts to see you go now.  Sincerely,  A Member of the Trinity Class of '99

       You will be able to think quite clearly today, dear Aquarius. Do the best you can with what you have to work with.   I was wondering how I managed to do more work in 3 hours this morning than in the last 3 weeks.....   You should enjoy a good working relationship with mechanical objects, and it's a great time to invest in a new gadget or appliance for your home.   Does my new  urlLink Dell DJ  count?  Don't be a cheapskate. Spend a couple of dollars to make your life easier.  Word.  Laundry went to the fluff n fold on my way in to the office!

      I still be lovin' TAR, but I do be havin' some concerns:  Do the twins have a combined IQ of 10?  Because it's really not THAT hard / confusing.  How is it that a random sampling of 12 people has never seen  The Mummy ?  Because if they had, they wouldn't be running around saying, "What the hell is a scarab?????"  If your brother's knees are bad, can't you just suck up and dig through the sand?  He's been travelling in pain all day, you owe him a finish to the race.  Is the bidget* insane?  She tries to steal a cab and when it doesn't work calls the other team crazy.  And carrying goats causes her to think she's going to die.  If I were her cousin, I'd climb up on a chair and give that whiny thing a big ol' smack up the side of the head.  Arrrrrrrr.  I be feelin' better now.  *bidget:  bid-jet (noun)  a big idiot or big midget.  take your pick.

Only his hairstyles change.... 2)  why did Tom Cruise want to play the vampire Lestat?  Was INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE actually a snuff film? 3)  why are all of Tom's girlfriends / wives v. v. pale?  Blood loss?  I be thinkin' that Defamer be on to somethin'....
