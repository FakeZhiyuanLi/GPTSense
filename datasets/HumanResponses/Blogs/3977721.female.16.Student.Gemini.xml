        This is what I wrote in school bout 2 months ago. I found it in my physic book. Thought I just type in my blog for you ppl to see how is part of my school life.  “I’m right dead boring here. There is nothing to do except writing in this piece of paper. F is rapidly talking about the ‘ang mo’ girls that help us in the school fun fair. E is reading a book by Nicholas Sparks, the Guardian.(that reminds me. She hasn’t lend me one of her books). Now F and E is talking bout some guy named J o W (my friend erase it after realizing this, so I don’t really remember who). I just knew that F doesn’t know St. Peter’s church is a Roman Catholic Church.( oh my goodness gracious me!) Now they are talking about the interact installation night and frendster (some sort of chatting program) Ok…. I’m basically reporting every conversation by F and E. Clothes is the theme of their conversation a minute ago. Ok. I’m still dead boring here. Just knew is already break. Jolly! Can eat my hot dog bun. A J ( she erased this also) is a prefect. Someone is so damn good looking – by E. E just squak like a duck. So loud. Here I’m am chewing my bun into bits and pieces. C and H are eating egg and meat bun. It looks bloody delicious!!!! Someone shave their head- by E. Woooo……. Shiny! Huh as if! E just squak again. A guy –by E- played the guitar, loves Hoobastank and one more thing I forgot. F loves hip hop, ballad and Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. E claimed that they are out of date. Then what is in of date? Who cares! I like Busted. E just yelled Ouch my ears. Should I call her Ai Lin. Nay, not nice. A little more about the great, brilliant magnificent me! No applause please! Thank you! Thank you! E just ask me to write this piece of crap throughout the whole year. ( this is where she realize I was actually writing what they were talking about and starting “editing the original manuscript”) Harry Potter rulez!!!!! I want the sixth book NOW!!!!!!! I doubt that it will even come out this year. So sad……so sad….. Next year got Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie. Five hours long….. Five long glorious hours….. Enough of HP. She squak again-I meant E- because of Van Diesel. Is he actually good looking???????? E is so mean. I want to cry. Joking….. joking….. Some annoying pig is pinching the stupid vermin bunny. ( the sound produced is like one of those small little kids shoes) F cannot accept the fact that E doesn’t want, I repeat, DOESN’E WANT an Astro. I think is normal. ( cause I myself doesn’t have one) G has a secret and F wants to know. Hmmmmm I wonder what it is…… anyway someone at the back just fell.”  The End of my school report.

        We did use air bus. This air bus has a screen on the back of the front seat, so can watch movies and play tv games. The last time use that plane doesn’t have one. Too bad no pokemon pinball. I missed that game. My sis’s gameboy cannot play. When I found the perfect game to play, the pilot said “We will be landing shortly”. Habis la my game.   It was quite fun in UM. A friend of mine forgot to bring soap to bath. In the end we threw a bottle of shampoo from one bathroom to another. I hope nobody sees the shampoo flying from one bathroom to another. =P. Then we are crazy enough to run up by stairs. Our room is on the 7th floor. By the time we reach the 5th floor, our legs we like jellies. We bump each other on the head also. Bang! So painful!!!!! My friend said she has a big “pau” on her head. While running, she also pressed the up button on every floor so that we will reach the 7th floor faster than the elevator. I heard the teacher say they thought got ghost! We also saw a group of girls who walk so fast(100km/hour) and shake the butt so hard. SO funny.   The competition lasted for two days. Their rockets so beautifully decorated. We were like died liaw. The judge said ours so transparent but we got 6 out of 10 for the design! Didn’t design also can get 6/10. Then got oral some more. We just crap bout our rocket. The ground was so muddy. My shoes were buried with mud. That reminds me I haven wash my shoes yet. GO wash later. Anyway, not bad la we got no 11, consolation prize. Out of 45 schools bo and only all-girls-team to win something. Girl Power!!!!!!!! The parachute time was 28.18secs. Improve by 18 secs compare to our Miri one. Oh well, it’s over already. We won must be because of your good lucks and help from God. Good enough!!!! .   We only manage to do a 4 and the half hours of shopping (shopping sounds so yucky. Exploring is more like it. What can I say, I don’t really like shopping.) Oh we met a few ppl too. (Nice knowing you!!!) And got this plastisin guy. He kept on asking for plastisin. Weird la. Then someone say he……………….. Hmmmmmm………. Better not say la. Now the band is going to Singapore. Can’t wait!!! Better study first then think of Singapore.

       Oh about the wrong spelling of “Daniel Radcliffe”, I apologize. Must have forgotten to type the ‘e’ or my Microsoft word corrected it for me. Gomen, gomen…… I wouldn’t have known if my friend didn’t tell me to read the comment part. ( thanks Alicia) I never check that for my own blog. Instead I always see what other people’s blog’s comment. Ha ha ha…  Exam is this Saturday!!!!! Ouch, teeth…painful….cannot….eat…junk…food…..so tempting… Anyway, I think I’m gonna have phobia passing up any work to my chemistry teacher. I passed up my “Lembaran Kerja” for chapter 2 & 3 and guess what happened to it. Lost! Ok, so I have to get a new copy and rewrite the answers. (Good for revision) I passed up my Laporan Eksperimen 6.2 and also she said I didn’t passed it up to her. My Lembaran Kerja for chap 4 also missing. She also hairan how come my stuff always went missing. Maybe someone thought that is a useless paper and used it to wrap nasi lemak since for the past few days I always see people eat it. Now I don dare to pass up my chap 5 &amp; 6 since exam is just around the corner.       My father just bought a DVD yesterday. I know it's no biggie for all of u out there. He should have bought it before i went ot KL so i can buy the Sailormoon series-The last season- which is only available in DVD.  So sad. So sad.

        I have an important announcement to make- I HATE THE “EVERYTIME” SONG BY BRITNEY!!!!!!! Ok… I feel better now. Furthermore my school kept on playing it for the past few days. Feel like want to cekik the person who put that song. Luckily they didn’t put that song last Friday. At least they played “The Reason”      Today band was fun. One of the instructor gave us a “new” instrument. It’s like one of those traditional instrument. You have to put it in ur mouth (disgusting! I wonder it went in how many mouth. I’m washing it with chlorine) and sort of pluck it. Don’t understand? Never mind. I also don know how to explain. All I know now is to make a different tune u have to “open ur throat”, that’s what the instructor said. How? Get a knife and cut it…. Just joking! We are to bring that instrument home and practice it. Toink toink toink……      I’m thinking of getting my motorcycle license. Too bad nobody in my family got a bike to lent me. Spity. It will be fun to be able to bike around. Ha ha ha….imagine me going to school with a bike…. So cho lo. By the time I reach school, my hair will be like a porcupine. Forget bout if first la.
