      omg i stayed up until 4.45am last night/this morning! I could not go to sleep. I swear I have some disorder or something...i already know i have depression, seperation anxiety and an eating disorder(no im not aneroxic or bulimic). what is it called when you can't sleep or focus on anything?(sleep deprived?) and no i don't think i have a.d.d. hmm well i had to go to school today...after a 4 hours night of sleep. I still haven't finished my U.S. history 2 but its just because i have one thing left to do-an interview on the vietnam war.i sarted american lit 2 today, well i got my books but i probably wont do my work until monday. after school i came home, went online for a little while and hung out with my brother and matthew(michael was still at work). then i went out to dinner with my dad, tyler and haylea. we went to olive garden then to walmart afterwards because haylea wanted a toy ad i got a cd-norah jones. i really wanted to find the all american rejects but i couldn't so i got norah instead..plus my mom likes her too so we can share it.uh we got home at 9.30 and i've been onhe comp for about an hour. not really exciting but oh well. tomorrow i'm going to alyssa's to spend the night with rina too, then this weekend i might hang out with some old ballet pals. oh my gosh my uncle just got a pool put in at his house and tomorrow is the first day we can swim in i think. i haven't see it yet but apparently it has a waterfall, rockslide and something else but i forgot...anyways-it cost him about $120,000. crap thats a lot of money.

      um this is a really long entry soi you had better read the whole thing...just kidding. i don't care if you read it or not. ok! starting from last week: Thursday-- Went to school(10-3.30), went to the beach(4-8pm) and hung out with my baby cousins at the playground while my brother, uncle, and older cousin went out inthe water.pretty boring day Friday-- I went to the summer arts camp because paul had to go to new mexico to see his amanda. It was okay..I basically just sat there all day and I talked with taylor, so that was nice. I forgot to bring a lunch(which is kinda good because I dont need to be eating a lot anyway) but taylor and little jenny shared some food with me. Um, after the summer arts camp I came home and got my stuff ready to go to alyssa's surprise party. I got there at 2.30 and helped decorate. Then alyssa got there at 3.30ish?(i dunno but it was after 3) We hung out a while and I watched the other girls dance. Then we went in the pool but nobody wanted to play anything except for me, alyssa and rina. We were trying to get everyone to play marco polo but the other girls just wanted to play "throw the ball until it drops"(?!) After we swan we danced some more then ate pizza. Oh and I was eating so much candy. Alyssa's mom put the candy "away" and I went in the kitchen and got a handful..it was kinda funny.well, not really but anyways. um alyssa opened her presents and then we ate cake. Everyone was trying to light the candles it was so crazy. while one person would light one candle, another candle would gt blown out. Meanwhile, I was eating a tootsie roll and I bit the inside of my cheek--my cheek crunched really hard, and I stuck my finger in my mouth and then when I pulled it out there was blood on my finger. I started crying..because I'm a baby like that.*tear*Turns out I gashed the inside of my mouth it really hurt but then alyssa's mom had me put this nasty tasting stuff on it (tea tree oil, ick!) and I kept on spitting it out...um later we watched win a date with tad hamiltion(although I didn't see the whole thing) and I left at around 12am When I got home, I went to talk tomy brother and his friend and shared some candy with them(like the jolly ranchers, ick) Tyler tried to call rina - "to prank call her" even though he was using my phone but she didn't answer. um, then I ended up staying in my brothers room until 3am talking to my brother's friend, while my brother was sleeping. Saturday-- I went to my neightbors house at 8.45 to babysit a 6yr old and a 9 month old. I stayed there till 12noon. um afterwards, i came on the computer and I think I went swimming at my grandpas but I don't really remember Sunday-- I don't think I did anything in the morning. I finally got to sleep in(I woke up at 10) and I just hung out at home all day. At 8 I went to rehearsal with Miah and Aliyah and learned a really pretty dance(my favorite so far) and we got done at about 10pm. Monday-- school school school school and guess what...more school. I stayed there from 10-5.30 so that was a late day. um when i go home i was too tired to get ready for ballet so i ended up not going, plus i didn't have rehearsal on monday. Tuesday-- Woke up at 9.45 to a phone call. my neighbor wanted me to go swimming with her, her two kids(the ones i babysat for), out other neighbor, and my sister. We went to the jcc(jewish community center) and swam from like 11-1. As you already know my suit broke as I was diving off the diving board.I also got a bad sunburn under on my face and on my back.Um, after that i went online and talkig to alyssa and rina in the chatroom then I went to ballet at 7.30 for rehearsal and i got done at 10(we were supposed to get done at 10.30)I'm glad Daniel let us out early. I think I went to sleep at like1 last night so that's  good. Wednesday-- woke up at 9.30. my mom had to leave to take my brother to get hockey stuff and also to the dentist. Plus the drywall guy was supposed to come. err at 10am Michael(the 20yr old twin I like(my neighbor)) came over and asked for tyler. i told him he was't there so he told me to tell tyler that they were going to subway then to the beach wehn tyler gets back.Uggh I'm such an idiot! I was still in my pjs and I didn't even brush my hair or anything yet and he was at my door for like 2 whole minutes with his perfect face and style and uggh*liana smacks herself* I hate myself for not being a morning person. I really should get a picture of him because he is really cute and from what I know he is a lot like me. as his mom puts it, we are both like "a squares trying to fit into a circle" because we both want to fit in?! I guess in your language it would mean we are both nerds who want to be cool and are tired of just being ourselves. Oh and Michael was talking with my mom abut me one day and he was like, "yeah I can understand why Liana donesn't have a lot of friends. I'm the same way" Eeek! that is so cool. oh and guess what..when he was home for spring break last year, he made a song for me on my phone and also gave me his cell phone number...psh like i would ever have the guts to call him, . I just wish I stayed friends with him because when  we were younger, Tyler, me, michael and matthew(the other twin) would all hang out and play nerf and hide and seek and video games and other good stuff but then as the twins went away to college, we didn't see them anymore but now that i's summer, tyler hangs out with them all the time. Jeeze i should have asked Michael if I could have gone to the beach with them today*liana smacks herself again, this time even harder...ow!, "idiot, idiot, idiot"* ok enough talk about my crush..wait a minute..woo hoo i have a crush now. yeah right like i have a chance..here lets face some facts: he is 20...im 15...he is 20...um, er I'm almost 16. isn't that illegal to be going out with someone who is over 18? wait so that means if I do end up going to college, I wouldn't be able to have a boyfriend because most college guys are over 18?! crap my life is really screwed up right now. oh well *"okay, liana. come back to reality"* um today I stayed home until 1.13 to be exact. I went shopping trying to find a swim suit but there were only crappy ones so I didn't get one but I did get 4 shirts with writing on them. shirt 1. "California Girl". shirt 2- "I'm a keeper". shirt 3-"save the drama, for your mama". shirt 4-"It's hard being perfect all the time." um i got home from shopping at around 6 so i had to rush getting ready for ballet.I  had class from teresa from 6.30-8. it was nice having class from her. then i ahd rehearsal from 8-9.30ish. I stayed until 10 just sitting around waiting for daniel to tell shannon, miah, laura, nad me what to do. my mom got me taco bell for dinner-which i shouldn't have eated but oh well then i watched a little bit of tv...then came upstaris to my room where I have been since 11.45 and im still awake. I wonder if i should just stay up all night?! I have to go to scholl at 10 so if i do go to sleep, i'll end up getting like 4-5 hours of sleep because i still have to write a civil rights essay right now. anyways...i probably won't write back for a couple of days. ok night night oh and excuse all of the spelling errors..i am too tired to edit this entire entry. UNFORTUNATLY, *sigh*, I am a Virgo. (Also known as "Virgin") My Horoscope starts like this: " Virgos posess all the charm of an rhinoceros and the brains of a rabbit. They are petty and greedy, annoying and argumentative. Virgos' lack of knowledge and imagination makes them unberable for colleagues and difficult for family. " ( urlLink Read more )

      I have ballet class at 6:30 tonight, then rehearsal until 10. Ick last night I had rehearsal from 8-10:30, then we talked about the company and other happenings until 11:15. I was so tired but when I got home, I watched the Cosby Show marathon until 1 so that wasn't very good My first performance with LaDiego will be at CDF on Sunday, August 22nd at 9:00pm. I think it will be an okay performance. Oh and I get to see sdcyb, Christy's company, and Phil's company perform, as well as some shot companies(cough cough cal bal cough cough). Ewww! I hope that the lady in white isn't there (Charlene Penner). She is so gross and scary to watch!  _/*\_ ¸.·¤**¤·.¸.·¤**¤· \* */       ~liana  /·*·\¸.·¤**¤·.¸¸.·¤**¤·

      So I went to the beach today with alyssa and carina from about 11-3:30. It was really hot there. Guess what?! I actually went out deep, like over my head (for a little while) it was funny, I kept on asking alyssa if she could touch the ground because I didn't want to go out farther than where she couldn't touch. I was so afraid of the ocean before today, but now I'm okay with it. oh and I got sunburned on the backs of my legs really bad. My face and back are a tiny bit sunburned but they might be more because it takes a while for you to see if you really got sunburned. hey-that means i'll have a tan and i won't be ghost white! lol. um I can't thnk of anything else to say so I'm going to go take a shower and put aloe vera all over my legs and face. bye!

      i woke up and my ankle hurt so i looked to see what happened and guess what? i got a monstrosity of a bug bite!  my mom said that it might be a spider bite. i remember a couple of years ago my brother got bite from a brown recluse and his bite started swelling. i hope that's not what this is because if it is, and i don't take care of it, it will rot away my leg. ok wow that was extremely random. i'm wierd like that, lol

      Today sucked...oh what, doesn't everyday suck? um, yeah they all do. I went to school from 10-5:15. I should have left school at 3:30 when I turned my work in but I had to stay to do this english/grammer program on the computer. I didn't even finish it but I told the teacher that I had to go and she was okay with that. When I got home my mom was cooking bbq chicken, yum! We ate dinner around 7 then I hung out with my brother and kevin( urlLink http://www.xanga.com/theshredder22 ). (yes alyssa, he was at my house today ) Then at about 8.p.m. Kevin got picked up and we were talking with his cousin while we were waiting for his uncle and my mom to stop talking. It's crazy, kevin and his cousin look like they could pass for twins, even though they are 3 months apart. Anyways enough about my brothers friends. Like the new layout? It is something different and guess what?! I made it myself. yay*claps* haha, I just took the picture of my desk and pencil. jeeze i love digital cameras. I'm such a retard. lol This weekend I'm not sure what I'm doing yet but I really want to see samantha because I haven't seen her since last year? I'm such a bad friend...I can never keep in touch with nayone. I'm actually surprised I still keep in touch with the sdcyb girls. maybe it's because i love them so much.. yeah so there is nothing relly interesting in my life to tell about so I'm going to bed now...at the usual time 2 o'clock am zzZZzZZZzz nighty night

      wow today was a long day. first off, last night I stayed up until 3am hanging out with my brother's friend paul. and we made him a xanga  urlLink http://xanga.com/paulisqueer   he is obsesed with the word gay so the whole thing is a joke but anyways... ok so today I didn't go to school...I called in sick and my techer hopefully believed me. So I did some schoolwork off and on until about 3. Then I was washing cars with my brother and paul...we washed my grandpa's car, my neighbors suv, my other neighbor's van, and we were going to wash matthews(one of the twins) truck but I had to get ready for ballet. um that's pretty much it. I started making another ballet layout but it's not finished yet oh and I am so mad because I can't download songs to a disc on my computer because we don't have all of the software set up. yeah so that means I am going to have to buy a bunch of cds or just listen to them on the computer...bye!

      zzZzZZ im tired. um friday night i spent the night at alyssa's with carina too. We stayed up late even though i was really tired. we went swimming twice while we were there so that was fun. Then on saturday(we woke up at 11.30) we just hung out and I left at about 1:00.Carina and I ate so much candy, then alyssa was taking pictures of rina with her swim suit and a retarded donald duck hat. it was kinda funny. ok so today i was supposed to go ice sking with deni and sarah and nicole and some other people but my mom couldn't drive me anywhere because she had plans tro go to my uncles with my brother and sister. we went to my uncle's house to go swimming in his new mega-huge pool! he has a rockslide, two waterfalls that go into the pool and one waterfall that hangs over the edge of the pool. It's not all finished yet because he still has to pour the concrete around the pool but apparently he is having it poured tomorrow or tuesday. yeah so whenever he does my cousins are going to spend the night. um i have to go to rehearsal tonight at 8-10. It's kinda sucks going that late I wish it was earlier or that we didn't even have to go on sundays. oh well there is nothing i can do but quit...and i don't want to do that. deni--maybe some other weekend we can go skating
