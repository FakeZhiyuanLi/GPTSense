      My name is Karen, and I represent the working poor in this country. According to the "experts", if you spend more than 54.7% of your income on basic necessities, you are poor. Without doing a lot of complicated math, taking into account my take home is aproximately $1400 a month, and my rent(before utilities)is $900, I will go out on a limb and say I spend more than that magic percentage on the basics. One month the gas bill gets paid, one month the electric. I can't remember the last item of clothing I bought for myself from somewhere besides Value Village. My work shoes have holes in the soles, but the kids need shoes, so they come first. There have been times that I have worked 2 jobs, averaging over 100 hours every two weeks to try to get ahead. I don't do that anymore, largely because of the impact my being gone all the time has had on my children, and also because it just doesn't work.  On occasion, I have had to resort to recieving social assistance. This has been rare. I have prided myself on working hard to support my children, teaching them not to be afraid of hard work. The problem with this scenario is that at my current level, I will never be able to afford to own my own home. I will be unable to assist my children going on to higher education. I have no savings. Some day, when I am no longer able to work, I will have no pension plan or RRSP to fall back on. I will, no matter how hard I fight against it, become dependant on the government for support, and therefore dependant on the taxpayers of this country. I WANT to pay my taxes. I WANT to own a home. I WANT to help my kids further their education. I DO NOT want to depend on the government or any of their agencies. What I really want right now is to go to school. I want to be a nurse. I applied, and was accepted, to a program that would, after 16 months, make me an LPN. I would have a career for the first time in my life. The first 5 months is the "pre-LPN" stream. Because I have been out of school since the mid 80's, and I am short a few of the credits I need for the LPN courses, this was the best way to go. Here is where the problems arise. If I was unemployed, or working less than 20 hours a week, I would be elligable for full funding. This would include full coverage of my tuition, books, living expenses, childcare, and transportation. If I was unemployed or working less than 20 hours a week, I would be on Welfare, as EI would certainly not cover my bills.  I saved my tax refund money to pay for the tuition. All I needed was help to live for the time I was in school. But the regulations are very clear, and I am unable to get any funding. Would it not be better to assist a single mother for a short period of time, to get a better education, and therefore a better job? So that instead of becoming a burden to society, she and her children can not only improve their own lives, but contribute to others? The poverty level for myself and my family is considered to be $27,672. We are almost $4000 below that. I am being penalized for working. For not being a drain on an already overburdened social system. For trying to teach my children that if they work hard, anything is possible. What do I tell them now? This is not the first, but the third time-and second provincial government-that has turned me down for exactly the same reasoning. Because I work. In the 22 years I have been a wage earner in this country, I have never once considered working a bad thing. I am beginning to reconsider.....

           " I believe there are Angels among us,        sent down to us, from Someone up above.        They come to you and me,        in our darkest hour.        To show us how to live,        to teach us how to give,        to guide us with the light of love "                                                         Alabama  Very meaningful song. A few years back when I was very sick, I found out just how true those words are. People came into my life that helped me make it through, and I honestly believe that without their love and help I would not be writing this today. Some angels are only meant to stay as long as you really need them, no matter how badly you want them to stay. Others, I believe, are here for the long haul. If you asked Nancy if she thought she was an angel in my life, she would tell you about all the things she thinks I have done for her. Truth be told, there were times when I did not think I could go on with the treatments; that I wouldn't make it. Nancy was always there for me - giving me encouragement, love, and strength. It was over a year after I had started talking to her online that I got the opportunity to meet her in person. When the treatments were all done and I was healthy again. It was like we had known each other all our lives. She is the kindest person I have ever known, with a heart bigger than the whole state of South Carolina. She, and her whole family, have become a very big part of my life. I love them all dearly. Nancy is the rock I climb onto when the waters rise too high. The branch I cling to when I feel I am going to fall. She reminds me that no matter what, there is love in the world. Her smile is everywhere in my house in pictures of the two of us together. We laugh together, cry together. When things are dark she is the light I turn to. She is the calm before, during and after the storm. She is my very best friend. In 6 short days we will be together again, even for a short time. The distance of 2500 miles between us is nothing for my heart. A very big part of my heart and love is there in Greenwood, South Carolina with her. She may never know how much she means to me, my words will never be enough to entirely express it. But she is one of those angels Alabama spoke of in that song. I am blessed to know her. I hope I have her close to me for the rest of my days, and that I continue to learn, laugh and love with her always. I thank God every day for sending her to me, because He knew how much I needed her. I will always need her friendship and love, and hope with all my heart that I am able to give back to her just a small part of what she has given me.

      We come into this world helpless, relying on those that love us to care for us. I never realized before coming to my present job that we leave the world much the same way. We forget how to care for ourselves, losing the ablity to do things we have done for years on our own. A big part of my job is to assist elderly residents in the simple things that make the quality of their life just a bit better. And, although it is not in my written job description, to care. We are not supposed to have favorites, but ask me any time during a day, and I will say "oh, he/she is one of my favorites". Truth be told they are all on the list. All 126 of them at last count, even though we are now down to 125 residents. My dear, sweet Lola has left us, sent by her daughter to a facility for Dementia patients. Yes, Lola forgets things, loses things, and most times couldn't tell you what day of the week it is. Sounds like me on any given day to be honest. For the last 2 months at least, I have blended up food, made applesauce interesting with cut banana, cinnamon and other spices. All because her daughter, who has power of attorney over her mother refused to buy her mother any new teeth. Lola has "lost" 3 pairs in the last year. I put that in parenthasis because i am not entirely sure it was not on purpose. She said they hurt her. She developed sores in her mouth that even with the nurses care (and we will leave THAT alone) got infected, to the point of immense swelling, and I am sure, terrible pain for her. The daughter rarely visits, maybe once a month, and then she never enters the building, preferring to have the car running outside and for Lola to totter out on her own. At 88, Lola still puts her makeup on every day, and is well dressed, clean, and generally a happy soul. But because the daughter holds the purse strings, Lola could never go on outings with the other residents. I heard her on the phone once begging her daughter for money to buy some more lipstick. Ok, truth be told, sometimes she would slip a bit and not get the products quite where they were supposed to go, but those of us at the home would always help her fix things. She would look at us with love in her eyes and say thank you, and you knew she really meant it. Lola was lonely. Like a lot of the residents here who don't get many visitors. So, being her favorite, she would follow me around on my rounds, just to be with another person. Sometimes i would get her involved with something the other residents were doing, but for some reason she preferred to be with me. And I was ok with that. On my break times we would bundle up and go outside to watch the hares that live around the building. She would be so happy, and clap her hands like a little child, and it made me happy to see her like that. About a month ago I was told that she was being moved. Her daughter had decided she needed to be in a long term care facility for dementia patients. Translate that to what amounts to a lock down hospital. Who was going to care for Lola the way we did? Who was going to know what she liked and didn't the way we do? Generally residents transfered to this type of care have proven themselves a danger to themselves, or completely incapable of caring for themselves. These things do not apply to Lola. Her daughter told our Nurse Manager that Lola's mind was gone. How she would know this from the rare times she saw her mother is beyond me. Our administrator, nursing staff, everyone tried to convince the daughter Lola was happy and safe where she was. Granted, as far as the administration was concerned it came down to dollars and cents. But for most of the rest of us, it was because we love Lola, and want her here with us. One day a few weeks ago, Lola was speaking to a couple of residents in the dining room. I was quite close by, but Lola did not see me as she spoke. She told the couple she was leaving, that she was going to a new place, but...."don't tell Karen, because I know she will be upset". My heart broke in that moment, and I had to leave the room to keep from crying. This is a woman who's mind is apparently so far gone she needs to be locked up, and yet she has the presence of mind to understand that me knowing this fact would hurt me?? Life continued on as normal. I continued to care for her as I have since the day I met her almost 8 months ago, trying to keep everything just the same for her, even just for a little while. She was supposed to leave this past saturday, and I had been steeling myself up for it. But the daughter had one more parting gift for us all. She took Lola out early friday morning, a day before scheduled, and early enough that most of us were not there yet to say good bye. I miss her terribly, and I worry about her. Will someone know that Lola doesn't like bread, that she hates salad, that she loves ice cream? Will they take the time to speak to her, and listen to her? All of her options and freedoms have been taken from her. It is an "eat what you are given" kind of place she has been sent to. I try not to think of her being lonely and confused, wondering why I am not there to take her to see the bunnies, or the birds that have made their nests by the windows. I hope that someone at the new place will grow to love her the way I do. I hope that I did everything I could to make her time her the best that it could be. God bless you Lola, you are in my prayers every day. I miss you. I love you.

      I am not a writer like my friend Jim down south, but being that I have a big mouth I am rarely at a loss for things to say. I initially intended to start this blog to write about my trip to South Carolina and the fun I will have there, but my life is pretty full of interesting things, so it won't just be about the trip. I work in a seniors home, and since starting this job last fall it has opened my eyes to a lot of things, and certainly put my life in a whole new direction. If you had told me a year ago I would be going to nursing school and working with the elderly, I would probably told you that you were off your nut. As of August 3d I will enter the wonderful world of higher education, in pursuit of my goal to be a licenced practical nurse. Many of my friends think that I will make a good nurse, and I hope that I will not let them down. Deep down I guess they are right, and the reason I think that is because I care. Recently I had a few things occur at work that made me feel that maybe it was the wrong field for me, because sometimes I care too much. But with the guidance of a few people to seem to know me better than myself, I am back on track. It isn't a bad thing to care. When I was sick I remember how kind many of the nurses were to me, even when I wasn't terribly kind to them. Pain and illness does not always make you a nice person. For all the nurses that seemed uncaring and hate their jobs, there are many more that care very deeply, and are angels here on earth. My belief in those angels is another blog entirely, but I want to BE one of those angels. If you talk to my friend Nancy she would tell you I already am, but this life, like the planet we reside on, is constantly turning, giving you new opportunities at every revolution. When I was younger all I wanted to be was a teacher, because teachers made a difference. For one reason or another that was never completed, but here I am again given another opportunity to make a difference. Not in big ways, but in the small, important, often overlooked ways. Is this where God wants me to be right now? I sure hope so. Would have liked it if He had brought it on a little sooner than almost 40, but would I have been ready then? Nursing school is going to be an unbelievable challenge. Samantha in playschool, Jilli in high school, Brianna and I in college. But I think all of us are up to it, and if we hit a few bumps along the way we will deal with it as we always have, as a family. We may never have had much, but we have each other, and more than that I could not possibly ask for. I will tell you one thing I do know for sure....I am going to be the best damn nurse I can be. You can take that to the bank.
