Isnt that soooooo great? Today's PE was kinda cute. I ran wit Elisabeth, Debbie and Vanessa and we waited for the teacher to pass before we walked all the way back.(Not counting Debs. She jogged all the way.) Guess wat? Onli three days more to campfire. Yay! I h8 this trainee science teacher man. My partner was talking den obviously u cant concentrate and den she nag at me. Why not my partner. Hey no fair cos she was toking not me! And besides, this teacher must be keep on failing her teaching exam cos she keep on coming back. Why my class so unlucky one? This year is streaming year and they keep on giving us trainee teachers. So far this year got 3 already k. So crappy!!! Haiz. Today we did the dance again and i nearly kicked Amelia's face like so many times today... Haha. I am feeling so mean. Hey shld i go bowling? I haven gone for ages. Haha.

Shld i be happy or sad? I reali dunno. Aniwae i gotta go now so see ya ppl some other times... Byez.
