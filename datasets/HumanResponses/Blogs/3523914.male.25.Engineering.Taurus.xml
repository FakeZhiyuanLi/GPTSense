      That's what me and Belle are right now. After having a fight and argument that I caused, we've been friends since..ah let me see.. hmm May 29? If my brain serves me right, May 29 was the day we broke up. It's a long story and quite embarrassing for me to tell you guys this one but I'm sure it's not because of a third party.  But Belle (dat's what I call her now after being used to call her Mami) and I are in good terms now. We watched a play called "Once on This Island" and Harry Potter last thursday. It was a fun day to spend with your ex. But we sure did have a great time. I hope we could meet up and spend another day with her.  Sunday was the third time we met after the fight and it was a day with her family. I went with her family shopping and ended at her house past 6. We talked and packed my things. We had a smooth and emotional talk that ended with a goodbye kiss. I really missed those lips of her. God, how I wish that it would all be fine now.   Here I am, doing nothing but think of the things I promised her to change for myself. Things I should have done when we we're together. Things she would look for a responsible guy. And yeah, I promised, with all my life, to achieve anything she wants for the sake of love.   Mami, if you read this one, I just want you to know that I really miss your laugh, your kiss, your scent, your caress, everything in you. I love you very much and time would not change it. Take care.

      This weblog was created and dedicated to the most important person in my whole life, Ma. Cristhabelle R. Estacon. I've known this wonderful person for almost 8 years and we've shared lives since then. She's the first person I think every morning and the last person i dream before I go to bed. She completes me. And she's the reason why I've become the person I am today.  When we first met in college, we became friends instantly. Together with 3 other friends, we got closer and shared every stories we encountered during younger years. I fell in love with her the moment I got in touch with her. We had good times thoughout our 8 years together. Of course, we had rough ones. But with the strenght of our love shining through, we've got more and more deeply in love with each other. We're bestfriends and lovers at the same time.  Today, she's working on a call center on a night shift while I work on daytime. You guess its tough to have time with each other? Nah, if I have time I would fetch her even from Makati to her house in Valenzuela and to her office place in Ortigas. At times before I go to work, I even tried to have breakfast with as early as 5 am in the morning. It's tough yeah, but its fun at the same time. Saturdays and sundays are usually are gimik days. So if weekends comes, we make sure that we'll spend the day talking, lauging and even crying on things we experienced during the weekdays.  I love Mami (that's what I called her). I love her more than anything in the world.  I love her more that my own life and if I'd be given another chance to live, I would wish she would be my partner again. I can't truly say how i feel but I wish she knows, for God knows, that I'd love for the rest of my life.
