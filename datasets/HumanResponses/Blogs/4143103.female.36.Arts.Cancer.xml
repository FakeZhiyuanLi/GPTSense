         Hi, I have been so cought up with the everyday things we all get cought up with, in our everyday task, errands and responsibilities we all carry in life. So I apologize to all my people out there, and I would never leave you guys behind.       Well, as you know I go thru each and everyday struggling to stay ahead in life.       right now I am planning of moving and trying to step up a little into the world with God's help of course. I need to move out before my son comes back home from his summer vacation with his Dad. I also want to welcome him home with a few gifts and a few cool friends of his. I want him to feel special. Thou Im kinda nervous since he doesn't get along with his stepdad, which I dont blame him at all. I told my husband that things are going to have to be different when my son arrives home, and that if he did not do his part or try to make things better, that there are going to be some big changes and he aint going to like it! Well, "oh well", like they say. I have had to put up with his crap for too long and I dont have to put up with it, for i have options and nit to mention, a life to live and not to mention my boy to! My boy comes 1st b4 anyone or any man!       I know that someday my son is going to look back and thank me for it! also I know that someday weh i get old, he is going to be the one that is going to be there f or me; not no man! For blood is thicker than water baby! eh-hem!       It is so true. It's been almost 10 long years that I have waited for this man to change. I have given him my all, I have put my world on hold for his butt!       I have stood my him in his worst of times, not his family, not his friends, but me!       His wife! The worst part of this whole thing is that he doesn't appreciate me nor the things i've done for him thru out the years. I have given my all to this 'so called marriage', I have dedicated my life and have struggled for this marriage to keep it together; but I always say it takes 2, and this marriage has just taken all the strength I had inside of me, it has drained me, it has exausted me, muchmore it has robbed me 10 years and for what!? I have nothing to show for,        I gained absolutely nothing/nada! I-YEOW-DA! If anything I have never been so miserable in mylife! honestly! I use to be an outgoing person and not to mention a very healthy one mentally and physically. Today, is all the contrary.       I am so depressed, so tired all the time and I have never suffered from so many migraine headaches b4 in my entire life! He is so complicated and hard to get along with. he is bipolar and has a temper that makes anyomne tremble.       Not because Im scared of him, no;not at all, but is the stress that he puts me thru, and he really gets to me and my nerves are just so bad! I am the type and kind that loves to live and be in peace and harmony. I dont believe in no kind of abuse physically or mentally, since as a child I had to see and deal with all that kinda drama through my stepfather. I would never pass it on to my future children nor anyone, since it deeply could be so damaging to someone's life in everway. But the point is, if anyone out there, is going thru something similar,       do something. Dont tolerated for one second. It's been heard for me to get any kind of help or support, since I have no family at all, none whatsoever. I dont have no one to turn to in my times of troubles. sure I have my Mom, but Im not going to burden her with my problems. she deserves to live the last several years of her life happy with her loving husband. So it's like wehn I have to deal with any critical situation, is just me, myself and I. I do consider myself a very patient person and strong and have learned so much from my own life experiences. All I know is, that b4 I die, I made an promise to myself to know and feel, what it is to have happiness, maybe not that, since I belive no one is perfectly happy, but at least come close. I owe myself that but even more I owe my son. Well time out. I just thought I stopped by and let you people know that Im still pulling and pushing to get where to I want to be. I dont know How long it's going to take me but as long as Im in process, I know I have to get there someday. goodnite to all, I try ult love you all..may God be with all. xoxoxoxo

         Hi eveyone~~~~sorry for the delay, but I honestly haven't been feeling well at all, none whatsoever. I have been suffering from migraine headaches and when i get them, i get them for days at a time, or lets put it, a few times during the month, You know what? I never got these many headaches til' i got married! I honestly hate been married to a man who's so selfish and is so much into his world, and thinks that the world revolves around him; and him only!, He honestly thinks is all about him and only him. Not to mention, he thinks i owe him the world! Im so sick of it! really! he is such a stuck up, and so needy, greedy, and so money hungry all the time! Thank God that I have always been an independent woman and I have never, ever had to rely nor wait on anyone to give me a dime nor a piece of bread. We have been married for nearly 9 years, and since day one, I have never asked him for anything nor had to wait for him to give me one red cent!  I consider myself lucky  cus if it weren't that way, i would've been i deep trouble ! For he is the kind of man that doesn't believe in paying 1 month's rent for the woman he supposedly claims he l oves! NOT! Love doesn't work that way. I could care less for money, 'honestly'. But what bothers me most and makes me sick to my stomach is when a man is not responsible for himself at all, and thinks that if he were to give me his money for once, or pay rent for once, that is going to make him less of a man or seemed to think that he would be some kind od fool! He's got it all so wrong! He is totally so screwed for life if he dont change! He is really gonna loose me if hw dont wise up! Im sick and tired for having to pay for everything! I pay the rent, I pay the electric, I pay the gas, I pay for the computer, I buy the groceries, I pay the cell, "even thou it's mine and what's mine it's his! So i dont understand why he considers it my bill and that i should have to pay for it!. " I buy the toiletres and so much more....etc. The only things he pays and yet thinks it makes him so responsible is the cable and phone, which I dont even use cus I have a cell fone with unlimited minutes and calls and could call anywhere in the US.! SP HELLO! As you guys see, Im way much better without him! He is just another additional bill in my life and the most expensive! To make matters worse, he gets mad if I buy anything for the house or myself! Like not to long ago i had to buy me new sofas and a computer! I say someone's gotts do it since there aint no one man enough in the house to do it! I guess he has it in his mind somewhere, that the less money i spend the more for him! KISS MY %$#@!!! I know what you guys are probably thinkin out there, you guys must be thinkin that he is using me and that Im dum for allowing him to get over on me. Guys listen! I am totally aware of the situation, and there are 2 things that seperates a fool from a good heart, and what God gave me one good heart and a lot of patience! A fool im not, cus I will never loose, for i know God blesses one with a goodheart, and shower ones with many blessings. So I never loose. I have never in my life been of a empty plate on the table, nor have I ever need anything from anyone. He has supplied and has blessed me in so many ways, no matter what, and how many troubles I have, 'and trust me I do', I have it all. I know and am aware that i have to make changes in my life, and for the better, and I do have my many moments of pain and sorrows, trust me. As I continue, I am goin to tell you of the many pain and sorrows that I have to face day after day. Life is not at all easy nor one piece a cake. Right now, Im going ti take a break, I dont feel well and going to take something for this headache whichis makin me so nauseated! Im sorry, but I will be back if not today tomorrow. I love you people out there, and I hope from readin my life experiences that it will help you to do something different in lifefor the better. see ya guys soon!

         Hi, everyone! Sorry I had to take off to bed yesterday early morning, but it was like going on 5am in the morning, and as you girls know out there; we all need our beauty sleep!right? right! Well here I am again and i have made it to see another day, I Thank the Lord for his strenght which we all need im sure, to carry on thru out each and everyday. Today has been a normal day for me i would say, me and my husband were apart just about all day. He was at the my garage,(which belongs to the house" working til 6pm. on a freinds car. That why we got along so well today! We were apart! :)Accept for one thimg that has truly depressed me this past month. Like 2 weeks ago I realized that I was missing $700!YES! Imagine if that happened to you! I honestly dont want to go around accusing no one. But as some people out there knows"if you reed my blog", that I dont have any friends and no one ever comes in my house. I use to trust people at one time in my life, but after more than enough dramas in my life, I had to rearrange my life completely. So that is why im sure no one else could've taken that money, but my troubled, bipolar husband. He is the only soul here with me, and I have never trusted him based that he has stolen from me b4 for many reasons. I know my boy wouldn't do such a thing, nor even cross his little mind. My boy is away on summer vacation, and not even his friends come in my house to play, and if they do, it's with my supervision. Plus I trust my son with my life totally. He is my pride and joy. He is the one who keeps me going. I love him so much, words aren't enough to describe what I feel for him. Anyway, going back to the missing money. I realize that money is replaceable, but is just the fact that he is suppose to be my husband, my right hand, my shadow, the love of my life. A husband is suppose to protect and make the wife feel secure, but it seems it all the contrary. I dont feel any of the things i just mentioned, if anything, i feel insecure in everyway. The 1st year was beautiful, after the one year was up, I knew this marriage had been a big, huge mistake, but in my religion, i was brought up that you only marry once, but in my opinion, God does not want to see anyone unhappy, since that is what I have been for the last 9 years and more. Later as I write my blog, I will fill you in. I knew it was going to turn out this way. I should've known better, but maybe it was necessary for me to go thru this drama, since I always learn from my mistakes. I know i will never marry again. Muchless trust in any man. I am a person thay believes in second chances, but he has had one too many already. C'mmon now; everything has a linit in life, and there are just some lines you dont cross, muchless even go there! It'll be just a matter of time, before I start my new life fresh and alone; Thank you! Well time for a break, I have to take care of something extremely important b4 I head on to rest. So stay put, okay ? good! Love ya all!

         Hi, Im Marriana;       One of my screename is; silent tears; why? I hide my pain very well. I consider mys      elf to be a very private person. But at the same time, for a long time, I have carried deep scars within my heart. Usually, before I leave my house, I put of this smiley face and wear it all day as long as i have too, and when i come back home, I take it off; and the next day, i do the same thing all over again. Does it help for anyone to be hiding so much pain? NO! Pain accumulates up to a point were you feel there is no way out, at times making you feel helpless. It's because of my rough childhood and thru out my life that I give people the respect they deserve, so in return, i get the same treatment. I feel respect and understanding is a mutual thing. It has to be from both sides. I dont ever want to treat anyone the way i was treated as I was growing up and most thru out my life. Today I've turned out to be a very, caring, loving and giving person. I live in my own world . I chose a long time ago not to have any friends, due to bad experiences. My only best friend is me, myself and I. I grew up having a very extremely bad and abusive childhood. It's because of what I went thru, that i want to make sure, that no one ever has to experience such drama!. If anything, I have grown to be the most sensitive, caring and loving person there is today. I have learned not to ever pass on to my future children, what was done to me, and all the bad things that happened to me. Oh My God! it's 4:22am! I promise to all, I will back to fulfill my journey! :) I have to rest. I wish all a pleasant night! And I love you all! HUGS/GOD BLESS YOU ALL      Ill talk to you later on today. ` Have a great day~at least I hope one of us will,,,,,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      .
