       So, I decided once again to have a blog. I've had two, but I never kept up with them, and i felt the urge to have one again. So, there has been alot going on in my life right now, and dont really know what to do ya know. Im moving away to college in about a month. There is this guy that I met, who is so awesome, and I cant help but feel good when I'm around him. Just my luck, a month before I leave, I meet someone awesome. Well yeah, today was a work day. Then I got to go see Bye Bye Birdie that Lia, Brittany, Ryder, and Brie were in. It was a really good show. Always fun at the theatre! Later.

       People are soo strange. Most people I should say. Some people really need to learn how to "grow up", but yeah, lets not waste precious blog space on them. ANYWAYS. I had a guava milk tea with pearls today....very intersting. Yeah and Marie came in today and gave us kind of like a lecture you might say, and I learned alot, but I'm sure I dont know have the things she was talking about...most of it will come when im older, more experience. I dont know what else...

       What a day man. I had literally the BEST lunch. Megan and I went to this chinese place downtown and we got some terryaki tofu sandwhiches...omg they were sooo good. Y'all have NO idea! Anywho...so yeah it was great. Talked to Whit, we're going to lunch tomorrow (yay!). Hung out with Keegan for a bit...got some peach pearl milk tea, which was interesting. Megan finished my scarf! Its so awesome, i love her for making it for me. Yeah...okay day. Im not feeling too great, stomache (sp?) isnt really workin with me. Contemplating becoming a vegetarian....will it happen, most likely not, o well. Oh yeah, we did this awesome exersise today in one of my classes. Two partners one is blindfolded...once the blindfold is on, neither one could speak, and we had to lead our partner around the area (outside, across the street, etc...). It was basically a trust game, and I learned alot about how much I really trust people. Its an interesting exercise, highly recomend it!

       Woke up this morning at 10 am. Went to the mall with mom, which was alright. Got 2 new shirts and new shoes...finally! So then I went down to the Montgomery and saw Miss Saigon again, which by the way is really good. So then Kelly and I went to Peggy Sue's for lunch, which was fun. On the way back we had some good laughs. We got to her house and sat in the car for like 45 minutes listening to music. "I didnt know how much fun a ball could be!" LOL. Aw man Kelly...good times. I got home and mom bought me some stuff from Costco :). Very nice. I went to go see The Village tonight with Kelly. That was one strange movie. It kinda sucked cos the people behind us were quite rude, and wouldnt stop talking the WHOLE movie. To top it off they were kicking the back of my seat, o well. That was my evening. I dont know what to do. Should something be said?...or left alone...This probably doesnt make sense unless you're me...which none of you are so...dont worry about it. My worries.
