       He started a small restaurant in China and failed recently. Around the same time, another Chinese person in New York opened up a restaurant just outside of Manhattan. They where both working 14-hour days but one business survived and the other failed.  The person in China has a huge debt while the New Yorker now has two businesses a Japanese and a Chinese restaurant – he still works 14-hour days just to make $10,000 in profit every month.  They say he comes from a part of China called the Jiangsu province, apparently most Singaporean’s come from this province. They say if you are from Jiangsu and you make 1 you actually want 100 and if you have a 100 you want 10,000.  I imagine he lost a lot of money in China. But how is this possible with all the growth in Asia? I remember Mark Mobius mentioning rather casually during an interview I watched recently that money is made by growth and investments attempt to capture that growth or something like that. I sent him my resume after hearing this - I never did hear back from him.    urlLink  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/int_markmobius.html     50% of all businesses fail – here is the statistics.   urlLink  http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/03statab/business.pdf     Maybe profit is the bottom line in business. Maybe he failed because he didn’t make a profit he just broke even for years until he broke.

       urlLink http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040818-105443-7992r.htm   I was in Times Square Last night debating with my friend about the future of China. But within 50 years, India will overtake China as the world's most populous nation. It's hard to project things this far into the future, and in 50 years I might not be around anyway. Is China the center of the universe or is India?

      Well, I spent most of the night last night pretending to be homeless and wandering around the city talking with various security guards.  I got cold so I decided to make a bunch of clothing made up of old Wall Street Journal scraps (they worked better for some reason then The New York Times and that helped.  I found a decent sized bench looking out over the Hudson River crumpled up a few wads of paper to make a pillow and presto I was set for a good nap.

       urlLink CNN.com - South America's 'tri-border' back on terrorism radar - Nov. 8, 2002   This is one of the articles that convinced me that I should be very careful traveling through this region.  It is hard to say weather there is true terrorism happening here or that what is going on effects North America that much here.  For sure, the problems in Paraguay migrated later to Argentina with the bombing of the Israeli Embassy.  The Argentinean side is a lot harder to get into without documents then the Brazilian side.  It's still possible to just walk across the "freedom bridge" into Brazil without any documents.  However, I did have the sense that the Brazilians are at least making some effort to control crime and drugs going across this border.  Clearly, on the Paraguay side they couldn't care less what goes into their country or out of it as long as they get paid off...    I have many other things that I would like to talk about in more detail regarding this tri-border region but it is very risky to talk about details.

       urlLink Chart - Proportion of Sites Blocked by Google Search Term - Documentation of Internet Filtering in China   I'm in this grand debate with some of my Chinese friends right now since I'm planning a trip to China... The other day I was walking through Battery Park in Lower Manhatten and came across a bunch of people protesting torture in China. I mentoned this Harvard study... anyway, I wanted to go review this study again just to see if my data that I was telling the guy was still true... anyway, I found the study. It's quite interesting... looks like the Saudi's block a lot of things too.

       urlLink Brazil to loan Paraguay US$300min for infrastructure    Brazil should be carful about loaning money to Paraguay. There has to be some other reasons why the Brazilian government is loaning so much money to Paraguay. I smell corruption...
