						     Ah, the joys of moving are again upon us.. :)&nbsp; We leave the current hellhole we reside in on this&nbsp;Tuesday.&nbsp; We've been busy bees trying to get everything ready for the BIG REVEAL of moving into this PHAT new house.&nbsp; The Master bedroom is awesome....Michael and I have all this space to put our stuff in, and lordy have we bought stuff to fill it! I hope everything goes the way we think it will in there...We are going with a modern theme, which is about a 180 from what we had origianlly planned...we wanted a sophisticated look in the bedroom and a tropical feel to the bathroom, but I think we have made the right decision to go with modern. We are getting new bedding (can you say Sateen sheets???), which is something we've wanted for 8 months!!! The rest of the house is great as well...everyone has their own bathroom and schoenherr even gets her very own fenced-in backyard, which will make everyone happy.&nbsp; Since we've moved up in the world to this fabulous house, it wouldn't have been complete with ordinary cable...SOOOO..we are getting satellite with over 180 channels on it...I've never lived anywhere with a satellite before, so it'll be awesome. Even the kitties will enjoy it, I believe :)...YES, they talk to me!!!! We are gonna have to have an awesome housewarming party when the government pays us in mid August..LOL...well, I suppose I'll get back to work doing nothing...but the times a ticking&nbsp;on this job as well&nbsp; :)

						    Well, everyone has to begin somewhere....I recently got my first vehicle (a '91 Grand Am), which has been heaven sent except for the battery going dead on Friday, which is fixed now, THANK YA JESUS!...I really don't know where I'd be if I were to have never met Michael. I probably would be in a dead-end relationship with no meaning or feelings. My life has turned around dramatically in just one year. It's almost been one year to the day since I left straightdom, which was only a temporary scenic route to what I really wanted out of life. I couldn't imagine living a lie for much longer than I did. I'm just glad I finally put what other folks think about me in that aspect aside and started going with what my heart felt. I'm not flamboyant&nbsp;by any means (except when I get excited according to Michael :) ...but I am just so damn proud of myself to finally throw out all the reservations I had about myself to become to person I feel most comfortable with. Michael has meant everything to me, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without him...He understands me as I understand him, which is something that no one has ever accomplished in both cases. I&nbsp;love him with all of my heart,&nbsp;and I look at our future together with great anticipation....He might say something to me about being so open on this post, but that's ok...I want him and whoever else cares to know how I feel about him...He is my special boy... ;)
