      Hey guys, now umm here is a song that is SO just me. Opening my mouth and stuff just comes out without a thought. Anyway guys just chill as i complete Miss Raja's work!!    My stupid mouth Has got me in trouble I said too much again To a date over dinner yesterday And I could see She was offended She said "well anyway..." Just dying for a subject change  Oh, another social casualty Score one more for me How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one soon  We bit our lips She looked out the window Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker And I could see clearly An indelible line was drawn Between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now  One more thing Why is it my fault? So maybe I try too hard But it's all because of this desire I just wanna be liked I just wanna be funny Looks like the jokes on me So call me captain backfire  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now

      I was reading K. Anand, president of Arsenal Supporters Club Malaysia’s comments on Arsenal saying that people are saying untrue remarks about Arsenal and stuff like that and I just felt that I had to point out a few things.   First of all, all fans of their respective clubs tend to be bias and don’t tell me that you do not jump in joy whenever Manchester United losses. The MU fan that wrote in to you was probably too much writing to you and making the statement but come on. Be honest, deep inside Arsene’s heart, he wants the treble. You must know that. Arsenal fans will say that Van Nistelrooy overreacted when Vieira kicked out and the punishement handed out to the players later was too much whereas Manchester United fans will say that Vieira deserved the red card for kicking out and the Arsenal players were let go too easily. Which ever way you look at it, fans will have their different opinions on football.  Secondly, you were probably right to say that Arsenal was not arrogant this season unlike last season but Arsenal has not been gracious in defeat lately. Henry and Wegner have hinted if not stated that their successive defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea are caused by the hectic schedule of the Premier League. Yes, we must all admit that playing fifty over matches per season is too much for a human but that is where the strength-in-depth of a team comes in. Teams who play in Europe must have enough cover to enable the team to compete in all tournaments. Manchester United and certainly Chelsea are able to cope with it, so why not Arsenal? The reason I am not stating AC Milan and Real Madrid is because they have winter break where as the EPL doesn’t. Faruok has a point when he says that footballers are being paid up to 80 000 pounds a week so they should just get on with it and not complaint.  Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger claims it was easier for Manchester United to win the Treble in 1999 — but evidence does not back his theory. Wenger said: “I’d like to compare United’s draw in the FA Cup in 1999 to ours and I don’t think it’s comparable.”  But United could not have had it harder. They had to defeat Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Fulham, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Newcastle. Arsenal this term beat Leeds, Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Portsmouth before losing to United.  Wenger added: “The competition was not as strong in the Premiership. There are more teams now who can fight and compete with United.”  That was a comment that Arsene made. I am being fair just like you said and that really says something. Manchester United played more games than Arsenal that season and they lost Roy and Scholes in the final of the Champions League and yet they won. I will not take anything away from Arsenal since they are still unbeaten in the league and I just hope that Arsenal fans will not take anything away from Manchester United for winning the treble.  Another thing K. Anand, you have my commiserations and I really do mean it and not just saying it but I just hope that every football fan does not start verbally abusing other clubs’ fans as this may lead to gang fights.  My tuition teacher also said that it is ridiculous for a person to support Manchester United and to admire Thierry Henry at the same time but quite frankly I do not see why. I mean everyone has his or her own club but don’t tell me you can’t admire other players. When Manchester United lost to Real Madrid, the fans gave Ronaldo a standing ovation for his performance and that was really a great sight to view. I mean when you see a talent, cheer for him not boo him.   Keith, I hear you. I felt the same when the celebrities made their statement but they probably do not have the time to watch every single game so just give them a break. Five years ago, most fans should know about their clubs history and as for your friends, I think that they just followed the game or just want to have a team to support.

      The problems facing Chelsea are not caused by Claudio Ranieri but are caused by Roman Abramovich and Peter Kenyon. Several purchases made by Chelsea during the transfer market were needless. Goalkeeper Petr Cech was a good signing in a sense all the goalkeepers at the club are in their thirties. Neil Sullivan, Jurgen Macho and Marco Ambrosio should and will be offloaded in the summer. Winston Bogarde and Marcel Desailly should be offloaded this summer as well and there are too many defenders that should be playing first-team football regularly instead of warming the Chelsea bench. Emmanuel Petit, Jimmy Flyod Hasselbaink (32 this year) and Mario Stanic are players that are going to depart Chelsea this summer as well. Many people say that Chelsea are doing football a whole new good, but I think that they aren’t. Young players like Joe Cole and Scott Parker among others are supposed to play 90 minutes every match and not come on the bench in the last 15 minutes. So in a sense, they are destroying these players’ careers and the national team are going to suffer from this. Apart from that, every day in the newspaper, we will see Chelsea on the back page of every British newspaper. It will either be concerning a star player coming to Chelsea or a new manager coming in. This will be good for Roman Abramovich but bad for everyone else. I mean this is not about merely bringing in a Henry or a Beckham but is going to demoralize the other teams and going to unsettle his own team and the team concerned.  For example, take Liverpool. If one day the whole team heard that Steven Gerrard is heading for Chelsea for a record breaking 45 million euros, the whole Liverpool squad will be concerned about that rumor instead of focusing on the match. On the other hand, Chelsea fans will be overjoyed with the rumors but the players in the squad will be thinking who among us will be leaving Chelsea to make space for Gerrard and who will have to sit on the bench in order to make Gerrard play.  Many of the players have voiced their disagreement at Ranieri’s tinkering but I think he is doing a great job at Chelsea. I mean if he doesn’t tinker and stick with his starting eleven, many of the other players will scream at the lack of chances to play first-team football. Veron, Geremi and Crespo are a waste of money. I think without these players, Chelsea will be better off. The secret to success for a football team is stability. Arsenal of today and Manchester United of the nineties managed to dominate football because of that factor. A team with a settled starting eleven with 8 to 11 role players will be stabile and they will be able to play football without thinking whether they will make it to the team next week or not unlike Chelsea. I mean if Ranieri sticks with his winning eleven and doesn’t rotate his squad, not all of the star players will even step foot on the pitch for 90 minutes throughout the season.  I think the best policy is that Chelsea start all over again and give Ranieri the freedom to choose which players to offload and which players to be recruited into the Roman Empire. Let next season with the likes of Arjen Robben and probably a few more star him have his starting eleven and let him choose his role players and offload the rest. This is his first year as coach to the new Chelsea, so give him and his squad time to settle in and it is best to judge him on his performance players at the team. If you are not going to play some of the players regularly, then you might as well offload them instead of paying them grand-daddy money for them to warm the bench and let these players waste their time there. I still feel that young players like Glenn Johnson, Robert Huth, Joe Cole, Scott Parker and Filipe Oliveria should be playing regularly instead of warmning the bench. No one will suffer except the players and their respective national teams. These players are supposed to be star players when they mature as players and not bit-part players at Chelsea, and I still feel that Crespo, Veron and Geremi are a waste of money.  Well, this is Chelsea we are talking about and I dare not predict what will happen to them in the near future. A few years ago, they were almost on the brink of administration and mid-table mediocrity, last year Ranieri did a wonderful job by bringing them to the Champions League and looked certain to be guaranteed a job there, this year he is doing better by going to the Champions League semi-finals, second in the EPL and yet looked to be on his way out. It will be nice for us to see them relegated next year, club goes into administration, Roman Abramovich jumps off Stamford Bridge and Claudio Ranieri can laugh at his carcass.

      The million dollar question on every football fan’s mind out there is “Can money (or rather Chelsea) buy the title?” It is yet to be seen but the truth is that clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United, AC Milan and Bayern Munich has always used money to buy the domestic titles in their respective countries and the much coveted prize in football apart from the World Cup: - the UEFA Champions League will come as a bonus to these clubs. Well, except for Real Madrid who thinks that a season without the Champions League is catastrophic. Look at Vincente del Bosque who lost his job just because he failed to bring it back “home”. Actually the ambitions of a rich and a mega-rich club is different. The rich clubs like Newcastle and Liverpool want to win the league, compete for the elusive 4th spot for Champions League qualification and compete with the mega rich clubs financially. As for the mega rich clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United, AC Milan and Bayern Munich, they will want the domestic league and the Champions league as well as to beat each other and become the world’s most supported club and the world’s richest club. Well actually who can compete with Chelesa as the world’s richest club? Even Manchester United can’t touch them financially. As for the world’s most supported club, Real Madrid and Manchester United will be fighting over that “title”. Like I said, money has always been used to buy the title but still no one has tried to buy it as quickly as Mr. Roman Abramovich who expects instant success. Look at Manchester United spending lavishly for the over rated Rio Ferdinand and Juan Sebastian Veron (who is played out of position). At least now, the rest of Europe will have to think twice before spending 20 to 30 million euros over a player. This will also teach Manchester United and other football superpowers not to be over confident that players will want to join their club. If they were willing to spend a few millions more, they would be able to get Ronaldinho who will become a contender for World Player of the Year in the near future and young Cristiano Ronaldo is not worth that amount of money and Manchester United fans, don’t say that I am jealous of you all cause I am a 100% Manchunian but I just get angry when I think that they missed on a chance to get Ronaldinho and got an inexperienced player like Cristiano Ronaldo and don’t say that he is one for the future because you all have to realize that the future is NOW if we were to compete with Chelsea and furthermore young Ronaldinho is in his early 20’s and he is also one for the future. And I hope that Manchester United will get Rivaldo so that he can mentor young Ronaldo to become just like him if not better than him. Furthermore, his experience will do us good. But even though if Chelsea were to get the title, what will happen after that? They will want to maintain that success and if they were to do that, they will have to spend more on players and increase the player’s wages to keep them on board their very own Titanic. Chelsea fans will definitely hope that Peter Kenyon will be able to help them make a profit but I see it as very difficult for it to happen and in the end, Chelsea may end up like the Titanic but I hope that that won’t happen so that I will be able to see what Mr. Abramovich has up in his wealthy sleeves.

      Every Manchester United fan have said that this season is a disaster and that Sir Alex Ferguson has lost the plot but have they looked at the bigger picture. Most clubs in the EPL would be happy with this position in the league but it is the expectations of the fans that has made this season a disaster. During the January transfer window, people have slammed Sir Alex for not bringing in defensive reinforcements for the suspended Rio Ferdinand. What is the point of bringing in new players when we have Wes Brown, Mikael Silvestre, John O Shea, Gary Neville with his brother Phillip Neville and the ever reliable Quinton Fortune. Who would have predicted the long-term injury that struck Quinton Fortune or the suspension that struck Gary Neville? Maybe the only mistake that Sir Alex made was to keep Diego Forlan. He should have traded Forlan for the battle-harden Gareth Southgate.     Like I said, this season is not a disaster after all because we are still in contention for the F.A Cup (at point of writing that is) and we will be able to experiment with the young players and give the new signings match experience that will be ever so crucial for next season since we are out of contention of the league and guaranteed third place. And by the way, the exit of the Champions League wasn’t our fault; it was the fault of the unreliable referees and linesmen although we should have sealed it in the first leg which we didn’t. Anyway that is all history and the future is coming.     The only thing that Sir Alex has done wrong was to tinker around with his squad and play some of the players out of position. Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes have already voiced their displeasure and I kind of agree with them. Giggs should play left while Scholes should be where he should be; that is in front of Keane and the defense and behind the two front men. United play better with two strikers up front as evident in the treble winning 1999 season where Sir Alex had Teddy Sheringham, Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole and super-sub Ole Gunnar Solksjaer at his disposal. Sir Alex should also play Louis Saha up-front more often and not waste him on the bench. You don’t pay 12.5 million euros and leave the player on the bench for nothing. ( a lesson Chelsea should learn from)     The remainder of the season should not be wasted. Roy Caroll should be given a few more games to see who should be the number 1 next season and play the new signings like David Bellion, Djemba-Djemba and Christiano Ronaldo more often so they could gain match experience and the fans should be delighted to see them play. Youth players like Danny Pugh, Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher and Chris Eagles should be played more often as well. I think all the players stated above have great talent and potential (as evident in the Carling Cup victory against Leeds) but the fans just haven’t seen them enough to idolize them like the way they idolize a Beckham or a Giggs.    Manchester United are having a cold this season just like during the later stages of last season, Arsenal had a fever. Great clubs of the past like  Leeds and Liverpool are having terminal cancer since the early nineties. Every great club has to rebuilt itself after a period of time. In the past, Manchester United was built around Bryan Robson and then Eric Cantona and now Roy Keane. Manchester United are finding its new nucleus that hopefully will conquer club-football for years to come. Every great team has a nucleus. Manchester United’s nucleus comprises of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rio Ferdinand. Arsenal’s nucleus is made up of (“ the French Foreign Leigion”) Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira. Four to five years from now, Arsenal will also face this situation where they have to replace their nucleus and only time will tell if they can successfully replace the “three stooges”.    The recruits brought in this season should not be blasted. Give them time to gel as a  team and adapt to the style of play of the league. The next season will also see a number of changes.  Diego Forlan and Nicky Butt are almost certain to leave the club to make way for Liam Miller from Celtic. Papers say that the Celtic starlet could possibly be brought in so Henrik Larson will follow suit in the summer. If rumuors are to be believed, Wayne Rooney should come in to replace David Beckham as an England icon, Fernando Torres will be the 4th striker which is what Sir Alex would like to have- four strikers in his disposal (maybe even Solksjaer may be given the axe due to his age) and a defender should come along. Propably a Gareth Southgate or a Roberto Ayala or even the Porto right-back. Not only that, a right winger is said to be in his shopping list as well. Joaquin from Betis has been a target for ManUtd and perhaps this August, he will arrive and by then Manchester United will have a player from every major footballing country except Germany. Perhaps Michael Ballack will come along. That will be nice.      Manchester United couldn’t outmuscle Chelsea, Arsenal or even Porto this season because of the Ferdinand trial, Wes Brown and Solksjaer long term injury and their return from it as well as suspensions but next season, Manchester United will be firing all cylinders led by Roy Keane who might just decide to retire next season if not the season after next. Teams beware, the RED ARMY has come to sweep you to HELL!!!!!

      Every one of us would like to be as famous as David Beckham or a Kobe Bryant but what happens when you become infamous? Then what happens? You want to lead a normal life once again and wish you were never famous. Yeah, we have the luxury to dream the dream but not the misery to walk the walk. On the bright side, sport personalities like Kobe Bryant and David Beckham get megabucks by wearing Nike’s and Adidas’. We have to pay a few hundred ringgit to wear those sneakers yet those guys get paid 6 to 7 figures to wear them but I would definitely not like to be a Fredrik Ljungberg who has to appear on every signboard in  Europe only wearing a CK underwear. On the down side, what happens when you make a tiny mistake both on and of the field? The consequences aren’t the same for a normal sports athlete and a sports megastar. If a Darren Fletcher were to receive a red card in a football match, it will only fill the bottom left-hand corner of a newspaper but if David Beckham were to receive a red card, that incident will be on the front, back and middle page on every newspaper in England. Not only that, he will get boo-ed by every away team fan in the country for several months. Of the field, when Kobe Bryant was accused of rapping an American teenaged girl, that story was on ESPN, CNN and even Entertainment Tonight. A rape case on Entertainment Tonight! Unbelievable!! If and when a sports personality makes a mistake, he will automatically become a villain. This is when the saying really goes “From Hero to Zero”.  Not only that, sport personalities are often picked-on. Normally females will wait for famous sport players to pick them up by a bar and a few days later, those girls will accuse those stars of rape. How convenient. Sleep with a guy and accuse him of rape later on. The truth is those sluts are looking for mega-bucks and fame are willing to sell their bodies to achieve that goal and those stars are foolish and naive for falling into the traps set up by the sluts. Famous examples of these cases are the gang rape by a few English Premier League players and the Kobe Bryant case. Another disadvantage is that sport stars have no privacy. Every move made by them will be scrutinized. Every transfer rumor and action will be reported. Every girl they go out with will become instantly famous. Every comment they make will be under the microscope and misinterpreted. They won’t be able to go out on a family vacation or do the groceries in peace. They will be followed, disturbed and maybe even spat-on by a fan of a rival club.   The truth is that most sport personalities want to be able to lead a normal life (just ask Roy Keane among others) like you and me and yet most of us don’t seem to appreciate the advantages of being normal. Just appreciate the things you have and you will be able to life happily ever-after. (Ya right, as if we will be happy without the millions….sniff) Thank you for reading this article and please give me your feedback on this article and my other articles.

      “I Love This Game” is what every basketball fan will say when seeing their favored team winning matches. The Boston Celtics, the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers have been regarded as the best teams in the NBA. Championship banners can be seen in their home stadiums, but when asked which team is the most well supported, well there can be only one Los Angeles Lakers. Celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Steven Speilberg, Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCarphio, Usher and Justin Timberlake have been to the Staples Centre regularly supporting Kobe, Shaq and Co.   Prior to the season, drama have been surrounding the Lakers’ season (as usual). Speculation has pondered over Phil Jackson’s future as head coach of the Lakers, Shaq and Kobe have been throwing verbal daggers to each other, Shaq was threatening to quit if he didn’t get a contract extension, Kobe’s future as a Laker with his court case and his contract running out at the end of the season, the arrival of Gary Payton and Karl Malone. Derek Fisher’s contract is also due to end after this season and Rick Fox injured during last season’s playoff.  The season started well for them but things weren’t as rosy as it seemed afterwards. Karl Malone got injured in December 2003 against the Denver Nuggets (if I am not mistaken) and the Mailman was forced to miss over 30 games this season which was more than he has missed in his first 18 seasons at the Utah Jazz. Some questioned his credibility when he left the Jazz to join the Lakers (with the “Glove” Gary Payton) to find an illustrious championship ring but who can blame him when he has tried for nineteen seasons (reached the Finals several time) and failed each time thanks to a certain Michael Jordan. He was also chasing records when at the Lakers.   The team looked unsettled with Gary Payton voicing his unhappiness to the press about the lack of playing regular minutes and Kobe was forced to leave for Colorado and fly back to games during the season, but when he was forced to face the court and fly back, the Lakers has won all the matches. Rick Fox and Karl Malone came back from injuries and the Lakers were at full force but still they weren’t as dominant as they should be.   The drama continued when Karl’s mother died during the season and that tested the team’s togetherness and everyone in the NBA sent their best wishes and condolences to him and his family but Karl proved strong and continued with his goal: to win a ring. The famous line “Offense wins matches, BUT Defense wins championships” has been said on countless occasions and the critics seemed to be right but the Lakers (as usual) defied the odds and proved them dead wrong. Kobe and Shaq lead them to a late charge to become the second seed in the west. They left the regular season with a 56-26 record and headed for the playoffs.  “The Fab Four” as they are dubbed proved to be “The Fantastic Two” when Kobe and Shaq seemed to be winning matches for them. Shaq and Kobe both cheekily said they were only 99.99999% fit and left the other teams worried. People were starting to question the other two; Karl “the Mailman” Malone and Gary “the Glove” Payton but the team backed those two.   Players in the team said that Karl Malone has been the “Big Brother” in the team, giving them advice when they needed it the most; helping Kobe deal with his court case, inspiring young rookies and players like Luke Walton, Kareem Rush and Brian Cook as well as seasoned pros like Shaquille O’ Neal and Gary Payton. He brought togetherness to the team. Gary Payton on the other hand brought a loud mouth, steals, improved ball distribution among the team and a capital “D” in the word “Defense” as he pummeled most of the point guards defensively except probably Jason Kidd. When the team had a strong bond, a feeling of togetherness and the hunger to win a championship again, the Lakers were all looking at the same direction. Kobe felt for Karl Malone and he has said that he wants to win this Championship for Karl and that made Kobe even more popular.  It was Playoff time again and in the first round, the Lakers had to face the Houston Rockets. Kobe had a quite a tough time guarding Steve “Stevie Franchise” Francis while Shaq had to face a triple-team from Yao Ming and the “Hack-a-Shaq”. For those of you who don’t know, Shaq is a horrible free throw shooter and they (the opponents) deliberately foul him to make him shoot free throws. Anyway after five grueling games for Kobe and Shaq, the LA Lakers won the series 4-1. During the series, Shaq said,” no one will ever guard me one on one, never, ever, never and ever, never, ever.” In the Western Conference semi-finals, the LA Lakers had to face the defending NBA Champions, the San Antonio Spurs. Karl Malone had the tough task guarding former MVP (Most Valuable Player) Tim Duncan and Kobe had the duty to break down the defensive brick-wall of Bruce Bowen. The series looked as if it was going to be s sweep San Antonio’s way when they led 2-0 but those two matches were at home. The media was looking to have a go at the Lakers once again saying that the Lakers with added reinforcements in the form of All-Star veterans Karl Malone and Gary Payton weren’t able to beat the Spurs who were without “the Admiral” David Robinson who retired last season. They were also saying that great players do not make a good team and stuff like that but what did the Lakers do. They came back 0-2 to win the series 4-2 and it finished in drama.   Game 5 at San Antonio, 0.4 seconds to go in the forth quarter with the Lakers looking dead and buried, Derek Fisher came out to hit a clutch two to lead the series 3-2. At the Staples Centre, the Lakers did a professional job to win the series and send the Spurs packing. Up to now, the Spurs fans and the team are still shocked and seething with the lost at Game 5.  The Lakers had to watch a Game 7 between the Sacramento Kings (or Queens as Shaq refers to them) and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Kevin Garnett showed the world why he was named the 2004 MVP when he led the Timberwolves to victory with an inspired performance. Karl Malone had to do all the dirty work again in this series guarding KG and he was victorious. The press and certain fans said that the Lakers only won because Sam Cassell was injured with back spasms. In Game 2, there was nearly a fight going on between the Lakers and the T-Wolves. Karl Malone was ejected (which is an equivalent to a red card in soccer) but he claimed that he was just doing so because the referees didn’t take action when Derek Fisher fell on his back after what seemed to be an illegal screen from one of the players from the T-Wolves. Shaq came out to say that this series was no longer a basketball match but it has turned into a football game. Before Game 3, the game was built-up to be a game which was not for the weak of heart but nothing happened and LA won leading the series 2-1. When leading the series 3-1, they had a chance to bottle it at Minneapolis but failed and it was crunch time at the Staples Centre for a Game 6. If they lost game 6, the series would be tied at 3 a piece and it would be a near impossible mountain to climb at Minneapolis to win the ever-crucial Game 7. It was DRAMA time once again at Game 6 in LA. Who would have ever thought that Kareem Rush would come out of nowhere to score six crucial treys (three point shots)? Well thought so that you guys would be like WHO IN THE BLUE HELL IS HE? Well now you know. Kareem was 6-7 from the three point line and was the X-factor for the Lakers. Lakers won the series 4-2.  Meanwhile in the east, the number one seeded Indiana Pacers crashed out to the Detroit Pistons and the stage was set. The Los Angeles Lakers versus the Detroit Pistons with Game 1 in LA. Leading to the finals, several storylines were set up for the Lakers. Phil Jackson chasing an unprecedented tenth NBA Championship ring, Kobe’s state of mind (with the pending court case in mind) and the inevitable; Karl Malone and Gary Payton looking for their first ring.  The Lakers were the odds on favorites to sweep this but that didn’t happen. In Game 1, Shaq dominated the paint but the Lakers still lost and the result left the basketball world flabbergasted. Some people said that Detroit won because the Lakers had one more day off than the Pistons and (they) the Lakers were disoriented for the match. Others said that Kobe Bryant wasted too much energy guarding Rick Hamilton (the world’s best conditioned player) in order for him to make an impact during the match especially in the forth quarter. I personally think that those two factors played a part but most importantly was the fact that the Pistons put more defensive pressure on the Lakers than what the Lakers put on the Pistons. Ben and Rasheed Wallace fought for every rebound and every shot was contested by them. In contrast, Shaq just stood in the paint and waited for rebounds to come to him but he was and still IS a factor offensively. He is probably the best centre on the offensive end but certainly not the best defensively. He is after all the league’s Most Dominant Player which was a title he gave himself.  Game 2 on the other hand was a classic inspired performance from the team from Tinstletown. The lead went back and forth between LA and Detroit. If it wasn’t from rookie Luke Walton, the Lakers would have been down and out. Luke who is a rookie in his first NBA Finals game gave an impeccable performance dishing out 7 points and 8 assist from the bench. Karl Malone struggled throughout the game after a knee injury early in the game but he still managed to finish the game but the star of the game was Kobe Bryant. Shaq had a good game but that was overshadowed by Kobe’s clutch trey that sent the game into OT (overtime). The game ended 89-89 in regulation time and in overtime, it was all LA. Kobe and Shaq outscored Detroit single handedly 10-2 in overtime. The game finished 99-91 in favor of LA. Kobe was the star of the show and Luke was the starlet.   Game 3, 4 and 5 were all in Detroit with LA facing injury woes with Karl Malone and Derek Fisher both having injured knees and Devean George having a lingering ankle injury from Game 1. The media were all questioning coach Larry Brown with his tactics and some fans were wondering whether Detroit could recover from the huge Game 2 loss. The media were saying that this would be like the 2000 NBA Finals when Larry Brown coached the Philadelphia 76ers. In that series, the 6ers won the first game but the Lakers rallied back to win the next four games to win the Championship. Before the game, Detroit’s fans started screaming outside the Lakers’ hotel and the players entered Game 3 without much sleep.   People who predicted a blowout from the Lakers were dead wrong as it turned out otherwise. The Detroit with their signature rock-solid defense got the better of the Lakers for most of the first two games. Game 3, 4 and 5 were swept by the Detroit Pistons. The NBA Finals ended 4-1 in favor of Detroit. None of the other Lakers put in decent numbers except Kobe and Shaq and even Kobe had a lackluster series apart from Game 2. That was probably the main factor for the losses. On the other hand, Billups, Hamilton, Prince, the two Wallaces (Rasheed and Ben) were flawless and the bench supplemented them.  With all due credit to the Pistons and their outstanding performances, the Lakers could have won if they had dealt with “things” better. For example, why didn’t deal with Kobe, Shaq, Fisher and Phil Jackson’s contracts earlier? If their futures at the club were settled, then maybe they would have done a better job. This is similar to Manchester United’s season a few years ago when the team didn’t win a trophy because Ferguson said he was going to retire at the end of the season. And why bring Gary Payton in when you have a reliable point guard in Derek Fisher? Payton was good at the beginning of the season, but since then he hasn’t been the player that he was when he was at the Sonics. Malone was a good singing because the Lakers have not had a reliable Power Forward and furthermore Robert Horry has just left for the Spurs.   Overall this season was failure to the Lakers. Even though they reached the Finals but they still lost, so what have they achieved? Nothing! They may have to start with scratch next season as the team is likely to be dismantled. Phil Jackson looks likely to take a break from coaching, Malone and Fox may (or may not) retire or they may join another team, Payton, Fisher and Kobe may opt out to join another team and Shaq may be traded as his contract negotiations is going nowhere. It is a pity that the most formidable duo in basketball ever in the form of Kobe and Shaq may be torn apart and after three championship rings, the nucleus of this team had to be broken up. This will be a bitter pill for every Laker fan to swallow but we just have to sit back and see what the future lies for the Los Angeles Lakers!

       &nbsp; On an ordinary Thursday evening after draining myself in school, I took the initiative to sit down in front of my computer and think of a composition to write about. You see, I have been given the task to write a 350 word essay so that I won’t impose Miss Raja’s wrath. The only ideas that came to mind for me were all circling around discipline as that would be Miss Raja and Mr. Yong’s favorite subject matter. Anyway as I was browsing through some of my favorite web pages, I finally had an ideal subject matter that would probably interest the majority of the Seri Surians. ________________________________________________________________________  &nbsp; Young people today, are they selfish and irresponsible?   Before I start my expressing my humble views, I would like to tell you what young people are. The terms “adolescents”, “youths” and “young people” are wrongly used by the majority of people as they think they all signify the same thing but they don’t. Adolescents are aged 10 to 19, youth are aged 15 to 24 and young people are aged 10 to 24.  Now, I strongly disagree with the view that young people are selfish and irresponsible, I am saying that because I as a young person myself believe that young people can be responsible and unselfish. Sitting in front of my computer and writing this essay for the school magazine makes me a responsible student.   Adults have a choice. They can either regard young people as problems or welcome them as partners. Young people themselves assert that they are part of the solution at the World Youth Forum. I quote from a statement taken at the event:  “Young people can and should be a part of the solution to the problems in the world. Youths are not obstacles, but they are invaluable resources for development.”  But sadly, adults chose to regard young people as problems. By the time adolescents face life’s decisive moments like saying yes or no to sexual activity, they are showing great maturity and responsibility when making that decision.  Young people have stamped themselves in the “eye” of the world by voicing their opinions in a step to exterminate problems like HIV/AIDS and sexual matters among other problems facing the world. If that is not showing responsibility, then I don’t have the faintest idea what will?  And I don’t think that young people are selfish. I think that adults are even more selfish than us. Adults show greed, for one. Adults have been known to be involved in corruption, murder, rape among other sinful deeds. What drives them to these despicable acts? Money, sex and power and I don’t believe that young people face these problems.  If the minority of young people is indeed labeled “selfish and irresponsible”, then I believe that it is the fault of the older people. Why do young people rebel? The answer is blatantly simple and easy. It is because older people like teachers and parents don’t show us respect and other values that an older person deserves. Just because we are young, does that mean we don’t deserve basic human rights like privacy and respect? As far as I can see, teachers and parents treat ys as children that don’t know a single thing. I am not trying to say that we know it all but let us learn on how to live our lives for ourselves. If we fail, too bad, we have to get back on our two feet and try again. Like the proverbs say,” failure is the mother of success” and “experience is the best teacher.”  But what can we do to change the mentality or mindset of the people who think that young people are irresponsible and selfish? I can’t say or tell as no adult will take our views seriously as they will think we are just trying to be macho and since most of us just reached puberty, adults will think that our testosterones are beginning to kick in.  With this composition, I hope to change the mentality of certain people and all I can say as a conclusion is that young people are not irresponsible and selfish. People who say that young people are irresponsible and selfish are really “squares” and they obviously have not seen the bigger picture of things.

      Everyone has ambitions and I am no different. Back when I was a child before life removed all the innocence, I wanted to be a superhero so that I could save the world from all sorts of evil. But then later, as I grew up, I became more realistic and I narrowed my choices. The jobs that came to mind were doctor, engineer, and lawyer among others. Why these jobs, you may ask? The answer is simple. It pays big money when you have these jobs.  That aside, never in a million years would I have imagined that I would want to become a radio deejay but to tell you the truth, up to now, I still fantasize on becoming a superhero like Superman so that I can have X-ray vision. Seriously though, when choosing an ambition, I believe that one has to be realistic that he or she can be able to achieve his “dreams.”  So do I believe that I can become a radio deejay? My answer is yes and I am not being cavalier when saying that.  Up to this day I still ask myself the same question,” Why do I want to become a radio deejay?” and up to now, I am still clueless. I think that the main reason behind my desire to become a radio deejay is because of my liking to talk. It can even be said that my hobby is talking. Sometimes during my spare time, I would even talk to the bottle in front of me just for fun although nothing would beat human companionship. I just love to talk and I believe that I can talk on virtually anything and everything to anyone and everyone.  Another thing is that I love entertaining people. To me, nothing can beat the satisfaction on having to know that I have made the worst day of a person’s life and transformed it into the best day of his or her life. When I crack a joke and when I see the smiles and laughter lit on the faces of closed friends and loved ones, it just gives me a glint of satisfaction. So imagine how would I feel if I was able to entertain millions of people all over Malaysia if not the whole world.  I would like to share with you my personal experiences just to tell you roughly how I would feel. Right now, I am currently SMSing someone that I speak fondly of and sometimes I would crack a joke or two. I would wait anxiously for her reply and when I get one and  I see the message reading, ‘That’s so funny.’ or something like that, I would be on “Cloud Nine.” I would imagine her holding her Nokia phone, smiling at the silly joke that I had just made with her back on her couch and biting her tender lips while giving me a reply. I am sure that everyone has had that feeling before and multiply that exact same feeling by a thousand and the answer won’t be close to what I would feel.  One quality that a good radio deejay must possess is the ability to gain the attention of the people. A radio deejay is “talking” to millions of people and he must be able to gain their attention and if he or she can’t do that, then it means that “he” isn’t a good deejay. When holding an event, and you see several thousands of people looking up at you in awe and listening intently to whatever gibberish you have to say, it just boosts your confidence and it urges you to do more of that. That happens to radio deejays on occasions when they become “emcees” for a certain event but that is also similar to what happens when you are speaking on the microphone on one end and having twenty-five million people listening on the other end. One most not deny that whenever he or she wants to be in the entertainment industry, it is also because of fame. Sadly, that mostly happens in the west and we are in the east. In countries like America or Britain, if you were to be a well-known personality walking in the street trying to lead an average life, people from all corners will be streaming towards you wanting a “piece” of you. In Malaysia, people will know your name and say “hi” whenever they meet you, but that is the most. Although, you do get free merchandise and celebrity endorsements courtesy of your new-found fame and it is easier to mingle with the opposite sex if you are famous.  The pay of a radio deejay is respectable but if you are expecting a fat paycheck, I advise you to take a “rain check” and choose another career that would suit your wallet size. But as for me, I want to embark on my course to become a well-known radio deejay in the mould of Ryan Seacrest and Rick Dees.

      Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I am gutted with disappointment at how the boys of Manchester United performed. The first half was okay but when they took off the big guns with the likes of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, everything turned into a mess. Well it must be said, that the Community Shield is just another “friendly” but then again, there are no friendlies in football, at least not when two of the biggest clubs in England, if not the world, are playing. It is a trophy but not an important one though. Young players will be trying to stake a claim in the first team and the seniors will be hoping to regain match sharpness and fitness. That’s why the likes of Thierry Henry, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes all played minor minutes.  Luck has not been on Manchester United’s side. Maybe they should call Lillian Too. Since last year, luck has been rotten and it has continued till now. Suspensions, injuries, international competitions, PR relations with the USA fans and even electrical storms have marred the pre-season schedule of Manchester United. Hopefully, it won’t get any worst.  Anyway, back to the match. The first half was okay although the defense was already in quite a mess. The second half was just to see how good the second string was and I must say, against a weakened Arsenal first team, our second batch looks horrid.  Tim Howard is our first choice goalkeeper and he did put in a decent performance and I must admit that he could not have done anything at all with the goals conceded. Gary Neville and Mikael Silvestre were both poor. Their form were disturbing. Imagine them against the likes of Drogba, Kezman, Cisse, Kluivert and of course Henry and Reyes for ninety minutes. Fortune was okay for the first fourty five minutes but fatigue got the better of him in the second half until Sir Alex took him out and O’ Shea was not good to say the least. Then again, that woun’t be our first choice back four. Our first-choice defense will be Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Mikael Silvestre and Gabriel Heinze and I think that O’ Shea and Brown will be used more frequently to accommodate Sir Alex’s master plan to give his Euro 2004 stars a well deserved rest. Johanathan Spector and Quinton Fortune should be given more starts because I think they are better than Gary Neville and Mikael Silvestre on current form.  Our midfield was quite awesome for the first half although Bellion looked like a school boy. I am surprised that Keane did not give him a lashing. Giggs, Scholes, Keane and Ronaldo will be our first choice midfield and those four will certainly give the opposing teams a tough time. Djemba-Djemba or rather should I say Djemba put in a good performance with some good tackles and he showed some aggression reminiscence of the glory days of Roy Keane’s career. Our second midfield of Kleberson, Liam Miller, Darren Fletcher and Djemba-Djemba should be good enough for the lesser teams. Smith could also play down the left side of midfield if called upon.  Our strikers are top quality. Van Nistelrooy and Saha will be our first choice with Smith and Solksjaer our second choice although Smith and Solksjaer will be playing a lot to allow van Nistelrooy and Saha some adequate rest. This will be something like what Sir Alex did in the trophy laden year of 1999 where he implemented a squad rotation to keep his strikers fresh to terrorize defenses in Europe and in England.  Arsenal on the other hand looked great for the post-Vieira situation. Their defense looked solid and should be even better if Campbell stays with all the rumors stating that he may flock to Juventus. I think that Ashley Cole is the best left-back in the world with Roberto Carlos. It really puzzles me why Ashley Cole isn’t used in the left side of midfield but they may do that when Ferdinand comes back. I can see Gary Neville (or Wes Brown if Gary keeps giving us rubbish) as right back, Ferdinand and Campbell as the two towers in the centre and John Terry or Ledley King as a make-shift left back. Ashley Cole could be in the left side of midfield with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the centre and Beckham on the right. The attack of England could even be better with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen and with the emergence of Alan Smith getting more experience in Europe, England could be a force to reckon with. Furthermore, with the likes of Owen Hargraves, James Miller, Kieron Dyer, Jermaine Defoe, Jermaine Pennant and Nicky Butt among others getting regular games and match experience, England will have the strength-in-depth that it has lacked all this while. I think that Paul Scholes still has the desire to play but I think that he wants to be assured by the new England manager that will come, that he will play in the position that he desires which is behind the two strikers in the hole and he will be guaranteed a starting place.  The midfield of Arsenal looks a bit stretched but still it looks great. New additions will be good for them although I doubt that it will be able to withstand suspensions and injuries. The attack of Arsenal still looks Henry dependent (although less) even though they have got Reyes firing at all cylinders.  The season will be starting for Man United this Wednesday and lets hope that they get serious. But, that aside, when all the big guns come back from injuries and when Rio starts against Liverpool, all the others in the EPL will be moaning about the dominance of Manchester United!! – Daniel Teh Chee Meng
