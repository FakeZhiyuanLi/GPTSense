      Oh how the time flies...long time no write.&nbsp; Life's goin good, to put it simply.&nbsp; Bio is a comical blast, so i figure i'll share some of the wonderful stories with you (and convince those of you who dont like woodruff that he is, in fact, awesome!):  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  -we learned today that when burn victims, etc. require new lips, doctors give it to them...but they arent just any lips. The clitoris from a female cadaver is removed, injected with collagen, and surgically attached to the burn-victim's face. PUCKER UP!!!!  &nbsp;  -a story told by woodruff: a man went to a urologist claiming that "something just didnt feel right inside." after ascertaining that the man didnt experience pain during urination, nor did he show external signs of any health problem, the Dr. decided to get him an ultrasound.&nbsp; he discovered an earthworm inside the mans bladder. at first the man denied knowing how it got there -"maybe it just crawled up there while i was asleep"- yeah right! After some pushing and podding and an eventual erosion of the mans dignity, he admitted that "he got his jollies from letting the earthworm crawl up his urethra, holding it there while it wiggled, pulled it out when it was almost all in, and repeating." the dr. was appauled by the perv so he decided to remove it without anesthesia.&nbsp; he inserted a metal rod with a hook up the mans urethra, and into his bladder.&nbsp; he failed to hook the worm, so he inserted a catheter, pumper some ether into his bladder (an anesthesia), knocked the  worm  out,&nbsp;  then  re-inserted the hook and pulled it out.&nbsp; needless to say i dont think the man plans on playing that nasty lil national geographic sex game again....  &nbsp;  In other news, a four year old kid from word named joseph asked me out.&nbsp; he said id be his girlfriend and he'd take me to a movie, then dinner and "we can have hotdogs for dessert" what a cutie!!  &nbsp;  I finally got my printer hooked up and working so ive been having fun with that...in case you wanted an update on teh adapter/converter fiasco from the israeli printer.  &nbsp;  tomorrow im not doin anything until 7 (...thanx to someone who shall remain anonymous...but you know who you are..grrr, just be glad i dont like being mad at you!) so if anyone is up for anything, im game. And that def sounded like an ad for a hooker...oops, the true me comes out...  &nbsp;  And so, till next time, signing out...  lex

      I suppose the most exciting thing thats happened in the past couple days is that my daddy came home from Israel, yay!!!  he brought me spices from my fave restaurant (I'm SUCH an Israeli) and he got my prom pix developed. Dont ask why he waited till he was across the atlantic to do it, but he did....meh.  For those of you anxious to see me in a dress, lemme know and ill be happy to share. Anywho, in monday's news....we started fetal pig dissection in bio.  Me and Brian are partners, but we couldnt be doing any of this without the sacrifice of the dearly deceased (though in my opinion a fetus was never alive so it cant BE deceased, but thats another issue) Wilbur Q. McPorkchop.    For those of you who've never dissected a fetal pig before, a few tips: The dealie hanging from the abdomen....not a penis. Its the umbilical cord! A slit in the neck doesnt mean ur piggy is "broken", they just drain the blood from      there and inject the veins/arteries with dye for our educational advantage as the       lucky observer (opposed to the rather unlucky specimen) for this lab. ~The pig is cold and hard, deal with the grossness. ~If you ignore the smell, the smell will ignore you. ~If you feel bad about doing this to a pig, heres its lifestory...the mothers were sows      headed for the slaughterhouse.  Upon arrival, they were sliced open and the       featuseseses (pl spelling? meh, moving along)were simply discarded.  A few of the  wiser meatpackers realized they could make a small profit selling the fetuseseses       to bio-labs.  And that is how lil Wilbur arrived on our dissection tray....      basically he'd have been thrown out anyway, at least this way he serves a purpose      even in his death that isnt a death cuz he's a fetus and fetuseseses can't "die."  And that about sums it all up, i hope you've been able to walk away from this entry and learned something.  And if not, perhaps youve vomited, which i also would consider a success.  I'm a sick dudette.  Tonite i plan on watching summerland at 8 and then chillaxin with the hw and perhaps some form of carbonated beverage.  we shall see which depending on my ever-changing mood.   Until next time kiddies, Lex :)

      i'll get right to it: so it was around noonish and i decided i wanted to sit outside, however unbeknownst (sp?) to me my dear sweet mother had activated the alarm.  of course when i open the back door, rather than the expected bird chirping i was greeted, and i use the term loosely, with a rather prison-like, mega-fone enhanced male voice shouting "the police have been called!!! the police have been called!!!" and various other musings from ADT security company.  I dont know wtf is going on, i just wanted to sit in the sun for a lil bit and study for my bio quiz.  i called my mom who was in joliet for the day visiting some friends and she said to just enter the code on the alarm, but when i tried it didnt work.  Within about thirty seconds the alarm company called and a rather calm and ditzy voice, considering the situation (if there's a robbery i dont wanna talk to barbie, mmkay??!!??), notified me that the alarm had gone off.  Well whoop-de-frickin-doo i think i was talkin to sherlock holmes cuz she was right on the money.  i dunno if the background sirens or the big alert on her computer was the tip-off that something mighty fishy was goin' on.  Anywho, so i put her onl hold, get the confirmation password from my mom, and then go back and give her the password in addition to my name and other info. turns out my mom gave me the wrong password so ADT called the cops i suppose.  My zaddie (grandpa, to all you non-yiddish speakers)called soon after to ask what was going on. his hearing problem really made this whole process much easier, damn hearing aids never work when ya really need em. so he tells me what the REAL password is and that the cops are on their dandy way over. well shit! i was in pjs so i make a beeline for my room to put on some decent attire for the policewoman who was on her way.  good thing cousin seth also called me to lemme know all this, as if i didnt have enough chaos to deal with.  granted, it was still nice of him to give a call.  thanx seth!  fast forward bout 3 minutes of more fone yelling, the alarm goes off AGAIN cuz i couldnt figure out how to shut it the first time and if u dont deactivate it, well it goes off again. to make matters worse the panel turned off so i couldnt put the code in, but finally it turned on and i managed to shut it off after a minor scuffle.  Cope comes, runs plates in driveway, asks for ID, and leaves. thanx officer [insert name here]i dunno her name cuz she never said who the hell she was (good community relations glencoe, im awfully impressed!) finally i get everyone off the fone and enjoyed a good 20 min in the yard but the damn neighbors kids started screaming and yelling. i had enough and i went inside.  im off to ariels house soon, hopefully ill find some peace and quiet there (eventhough i know i wont...) later kids, lexypoo cuddley-kins signing out

      as most typical horror stories begin....I got in the car with my mom. There really isnt much of a story here, just that the hygenist lady (for you uneducated buffoons, the hygenist is the person at the dentist's office that cleans your teeth) was SUCH a bitch.&nbsp; Every other phrase out of her mouth was "tsk tsk tsk you NEED to floss EVERY day!" And i say: Pshah! You show me more than ten teens you know that do that...my ASS the majority of people floss daily and brush TWICE daily, Trude (the Bitch) Hygenist! I think her stats are a little skewed.....silly dental school dropout (i assume...) I need to go back in a few weeks to have some sealant stuff put on but other than that nothing big happening with the whole dentistry thing. However Orthodontically speaking,&nbsp; im due for my first appointment next week.&nbsp; Fingers&nbsp;crossed that i can get invisalign so i wont have a mouth full of metal...but we'll wait and see...   in other news, &nbsp;bio is almost over :( im actually sad about this....but we do get to go to Illinois State Beach tomorrow to do some water testing stuff and on thursday woody is having a cookout for us :)!&nbsp; Consider urself reminded to ask me about the Garreth/Pot story from class cuz i dont feel like typing it all out now. And for those of u awaiting an answer, contrary to what mr woodruff says, i do not have a substance abuse problem nor do i have syphillis!   That about covers everything i think, 'cept to say   WELCOME HOME ILANA!!!    and i bet you thought i forgot....i gotta say things without you have been, well, more fun....but we're glad to have u back anyways! :) And on that happy note, i bid you all adieu.     Until we meet again bwa ha ha,  lex

      Nice people normally don't chase people who HATE pig around with a cut open pig. Only very bad people do that, especially when the nice victim has requested many times for the bad person to cease and desist. I mean, what the hell is up with that. In conclusion you are no longer a good person.   Anyways, the rest of the day was good. I got to see the Chicago premeir of Little Black Book, which was very funny&nbsp;and interesting, especially if you like seeing Brittany Murphy in her underwear. My sick head is still poo. But it couldn't get in my way of having some good joking fun with Steve. "The button..it was there so I just pressed it...o god...please open the gates" That was money.   So I'm just vegitititating and enjoying that 70's show...y'all feel free to call me after school tomorrow unless your a bad person. Byie.

      So i havent exactly written in a while...my bad.&nbsp; So much happens from day to day it'd be impossible to recount it all so ill just leave it at this: consider the gap the Dark Ages of Alexa.&nbsp; I'll try and be better about the whole blog-writing thing, meaning more often that is.&nbsp;  Yesterday I threw an impromptu party and the beach for benedict.&nbsp; Attendance was lower than expected but what do you want on such short notice.&nbsp; After a minor fight and health-threat at Dominos i was at the beach with pizza, chips, drinks, and cake (thanx abby...she brough plates/forks/etc. too, gotta give a girl credit where credit is due :)) Party was pretty fun, we established that i can't throw a frisbee, everyone should do Biz/Pro and not crew, and that i'm shorter than josh.&nbsp; Afterwards I saw Bourne Supremacy with Steve and chilled with him for the rest of the day.&nbsp; P.S. the movie was, for lack of a better word, poo! i fell asleep for most of it, the theater was full of old people, and i sat next to a guy who reeked of fried chicken and the cheapest cologne walmart carries.  I also had a sneaking suspicion that i was getting sick. A suspicion confirmed later that nite when i felt like satan laid eggs in my throat. I'm still sick at 7:40 on sunday and i have the pig practical tomorrow.&nbsp; Funny how im not really that bummed about all this...how un-Alexalike.&nbsp; And now im gonna go drink some left-over Pepsi and stew in a pile of my own filth (translation: bed)  Signing out,  Lex

      hey there faithful readers! How've y'all been (please do not answer, as I dont have energy to care)?  In the "Good News" news, work is over next friday and then i get to go down to ISU with my cuzin Britt to set up her apartment for her upcoming junior year.  We're not sure how long we're staying down (def maximum of one nite, two days) because she may have a baby-sitting job.  Also in the "Good News" column, i had my hair straightened and it looks AWESOME if i may say so myself...and i may!  I don't really have anything major to add to the "Bad News" section, just that I've been pretty bored but what'cha gonna do...watching ER from 9-11 am has been pretty exciting i suppose...:(  Well now that I've managed to remind myself of my boredom, i'm gonna return to stewing in a pile of my own filth (that means bed) until my doctor appointment later until we meet again, Lex

      My apologies to those of you who frequent my blog in hopes of a new entry. I've let you all down and ill do my best to get around to this more often (ps...i dont really see myself fulfilling that promise).  Stuff happened in the past few days, nothing really story-worthy.  Steve left for LA for 3 weeks (punishment will be severe! grr), works goin' good, and i get to sleep late now that school is over. My mom left for Israel for 2 weeks so me and the dad have the house all to ourselves :).  Otherwise I'm just hanging around being bored and whatnot (is this one word? two? hyphenated?) I'm really into the show Trading Spouses which I'm actually watching now.  Summerland is also pretty big with me, and will be on in approximately 13 min. ) The rich people on TS are sooo mean and the lower-class people are incredibly nice.  I'd rather be dirt-poor and appreciate the things and most of all people in my life, instead of being filthy rich and taking all that I have forgranted.  Of course, even if i was poor i'd hope to have found a way to get that blue diamond ;) *wink wink* Anyways, I'm gonna return to my tv, so y'all have fun and all that good stuff. signing out, lexypoo cuddlykins
