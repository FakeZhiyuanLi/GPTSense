      The dinner was attended by a few of the ‘seniors’ in the mkting department too – ppl who had gone through the MT stint a few years ago. The first hour was just them telling us all the stories of what they went through. How one Indian guy from the University of Alabama joined our company and was promptly sent to Bihar, but who was now a successful brand manager….. the dinner had all the makings for a finale where the postings would be revealed.   AS, SA and I were the vociferous ones. Alternatively took turns to badger SM and HA (head of talent mgmt). Tried using all the negotiating analysis tactics I had learnt at ISB - played Bad Cop with SM, tried getting emotional with HA that I was going to leave tommorrow and hence had to find out; put the presusure of numbers on them by also asking the seniors to make them tell us…..asked the 3 girls to work on HA, while we 3 boys worked on SM….but all to no avail. They kept mum, sipped more beer and kept lapping up the kababs. SA even went to the extent of saying that his mom was calling every hour to find out, and that she couldn’t take the pressure. AS took the more professional route – told them that all our ISB friends knew by now where their respective postings are, and we were the only ones not to know. How The company brand image would go down in the eyes of the ISBians. But nope. They kept shut. More beer and more kebabs. By the time the ice-cream arrived, we kinda knew that we weren’t going to get our way – though both of them did appreciate our 3 hour perseverant pester power. We headed back to the chummery, and spent a couple of hours talking away – everybody was being nice to me that I had to go to A’bad. Even the early-to-sleep-early-to-rise guys stayed up. Really nice of them. Funny how soon I had bonded with this gang.

      That afternoon I had my first ever visit to a factory – The Sewri factory that makes toothpaste. The only factories I had seen were those on TV / Movies and of course from all the case studies at B school. Had visions of huge assembly lines, sprawling premises and white lab-coated men working on computers. This factory visit made me smell the coffee.   The factory was a remodelled hospital and unlike other places had a vertical formation i.e. instead of raw materials going from one machine to another next to it (horizonatlly) the stuff moved from one hospital floor to the other below it. Vertical integration all the way! Toothpaste manufacturing, as I found out, was not all that sophisticated. Basic raw materials, a mixer and few heaters and you’re ready to brush. But the productivity of the place amazed me – Year on year they had managed huge cost savings through innovations and continuos improvement programs. The quality aspect was continuosuly reinforced – right form how they keep tabs on not only their systems but also those of their vendors and contract manufactuers. After this 2 hour visit, we were on our way back to powai and our eagerly awaited dinner.

      The 3 days of presentations made by the various heads of department and brand managers gave us a neat insght into the way company and the industry functions . Post the market visits, we could relate to a lot of the stuff and could even challenge a lot of it.   In between each of these presentation, we would keep pestering SM, an HR manager, to find out about our sales postings, but we always got the same answer – “Its still being finalised”. I was to leave to aurangabad in two days time, and I so badly wanted to find out before I left – with all the others! On wednesay night (I was to leave on Thursday morning), SM & HA (another HR) invited us all out for dinner. We were all sure that this dinner would be where we found out! The whole day we spoke about nothing else. Speculations galore – and all kinds of theories about how postings should be done came up. We discuseed how postings were done at Levers, Reckitts , P&G etc, and quite frankly could have written a whole book on “Dummies guide to sales postings”.

      My fellow MTs:   There were 10 of them – from 7 different b-schools. 6 guys, 3 women. Right from go we all kinda gelled well, more because I think we all shared the common fear of the upcoming sales stints. As usual I was amongst the only two non engineers - the nostalgia of being the ‘diversity’ candidate at ISB hit me again.  The 4 th day at office, as I was getting my 3rd cup of coffeee to keep me going through the corporate presentations, I noticed something new on the notice board. Pinned on four A4 size sheets of paper were profiles and pictures of all the MTs. Something to let the rest of the office know who the new bakras were. Looked for my name first and went through my profile to make sure it was right – didn’t bother looking at the picture. How many pictures have I looked good in anyways ?   Then I started reading the profiles of the others. At the guest house and the chummery we had always stopped at “which school you from” and ‘what are your interests”. Here I was getting to know much more and it bothered me big time – Subhashini was a first ranker at the CET exams, Indira was a top ranker in BITS Pilani, Ashish was a topper at NITIE and had got a scholorship, Ujjwal had got some merit scholorship himself.And Sunder  was interested in photography and lawn tennis! Diversity all the way!

      That night and on Saturday night was a long ISB reunion. Managed to meet over 30 ISBians in bbay that weekend. Especially since this was to be my last weekend in bbay , I wanted to live it up in style. Didn’t match any of the ISB parties – but it was fun anyway. Took a cab home from Dadar to powai at 4 in the morning. This city never sleeps – even at that time there were ppl on the roads whom we could ask directions.  The Sunday was supposed to be ppt making day. For the first time I encountered the ppt vs acetate split. Apart from the 2 isbians and two others, the rest wanted to use acetates to make the presentation. Found it very funny, especially considering that I had never used acetates. At ISB we always used ppts. Apparently that was not the case in the IIMs and XLRIs of the world.  Most presentations fared on the same scale. Except for one enthu-cutlet who had gone around taking pictures of the retail visits, and used some major graphics in his ppt. Thought it was a total waste of time to do all that, considering that we were supposed to cover 3 days of insights into 5 minutes. That guy’s ppt went on for some 25 minutes. So long, that all his efforts in creating a good ppt was in vain – after all most ppl close their eyes when yawning . But I must admit, the idea of putting pictures of the shelf space etc was a bloody good one. Full marks to him for effort and enthu.

      The next day was at Kailash medicals in Fort. This time around I took a second class train ticket - missed the bhajans of course..but what the hell. The chemist shops are so very different from the kirana stores.... people don’t some here to "shop’ - they come to purchase very specific products and brands... Went to the Mcdonalds that day for lunch...AS and SA- two other MTs - were also in the fort area and the 3 of met up to dig into some McVeggie burgers. We also came very close to going for an afternoon show to New Excelsior which was just next door..but the chemist beckoned....after another boring 4 hours started for home..the MT gang also had plans to go out to a powai pub that nite..so took the 7.20 fast train to ghatkopar..and an auto from there to Hiranandani Gardens.   Hiranandani gardens (HG), for those who haven’t been there, is a small enclosed township in powai. Before HG came up, the only thing that powai was famous for was the IIT. The once geek-land is now a posh locality with tons of high rise buildings with firangi names like Verona, Lake Castle, Brentwood etc. All the buildings are also built as remixes of the coliseum and the parthenon...high pillars, larger than life monoliths etc. A central ‘galleria’ which houses all the shops, a food court, a hotel, banks etc serves as the 'Connought Place' for this Delhi. Movie shootings happen at least once a month outside the galleria. All in all, a nice bombay place, without the bombay din and crowds.   That night at the pub, all the MTs had our first session of predictions about where each of us would get our sales stints. While none of the Tams wanted to go back to Chennai, each of us secretly feared that knowledge of the language would just pull us back. We weren't as clever as Priyankar, last years MT, a marwadi who had grown up in chennai, who had cleverly left out Tamil as a language he knew in the form he filled. The end consensus was that the women would go to the south - since it is a safer place compared to the cow belt. The delhi gang would get the west - since they couldn’t be put too close to home. And we tams would be sent up north or east. But the bottomline was that everyone wanted to be the one MT who gets the bombay territory.   The next day was the supermarket visit – had to go this place in vashi. Having had enough of trains for 2 days, I decided to go by auto. Left at 9.30 and it took a good hour to reach the bridge over the vashi creek. Soon after passing the bridge the auto was stopped by a policeman. The look of resignation on the autowallahs face made me wonder what we had done wrong – surely the auto cant have crossed the speed limit. Only then did I learn that autos need a permit to operate in the Vashi region – apparently that is not considered part of regular ‘bombay’. After an hour at the police chowki, where the policeman insisted I also wait, and after the autowallah got his ticket, I was left wondering how to get to vashi from the middle of this highway. The only way out was to take the auto back, cross the bridge again and go to the closest station on the harbour line. I finally reached Apna Bazaar at 12.30 - three hours after I left home. The Supermarket experience turned out to be as expected. No major insights. The only big observation was that most people shopped in pairs or in larger groups. This leads to a sense of consultative shopping where every brand and promo is discussed with each other before purchase. Saw a lot of brand loyalists change their minds only because their friends husband had liked a specific shampoo or toothpaste or whatever.

      Let me tell you a bit about our training format here – after 3 days of market visits, we would have 3 days of presentations by the various department heads – Marketing, Sales, Finance, Supply Chain, HR etc. Post that would be a 3-week Supply chain stint, a 6-month sales stint and finally a 4-month marketing stint. The next 3 days we were supposed to be out on mkt visits..... no choice but to chin up and get ready to face some retailer music.......   My fist visit was to Hakimi stores in crawford mkt..... that was like the wrong end of town as far as I was concerned...powai was north...crawford mkt south...and that left me with only one option - head for the good ol bombay local trains! Everyone, at some point or the other in their lives, has heard stories from their friends about "my first time in the bombay local trains". Those stories almost created a certain sense of romanticism about the experience.... And i was all set for it. Bought a first class ticket for 78 bucks... (My first trip after all - the romanticism wasn’t high enough to risk a second class ticket).... but it all went for a toss the minute the train arrived at kanjur marg station. Lesson no. 1 - in the peak hours the first class compartment is just as crowded as the second class....and arm pits in your face will smell the same whether u pay Rs. 78 or Rs. 9. Soon after the train pulled out of the station, I suddenly realized why I had paid the 69 rupee premium.... dholaks began, and cymbals followed as an ardent gang started singing bhajans. After 45 minutes of 'hare rama hare krishna" - the unplugged version - I got out at VT station.... a very different smelling man... but hey! at least I had my own 'bombay local train' story to tell now!   Crawford mkt, for the uninitiated, is one of the busiest mkts in bbay. Set inside a huge building of sorts, there are rows and rows of small 70-80 sq ft shops on both sides of a small 6 feet lane. Hakimi stores had 2 shops...one facing the other across the lane. One shop stocked household items and commodities, and the other had the fmcg stuff. If one customer went to the household items side and asked for a ketchup, the guy would just holler, and a 200 gms maggi sauce bottle would come flying across the lane over everyone’s head, only to land perfectly in the shouter’s hands. Sheer ketchup in motion...very classily done...and the crowd also seemed to know this and kept walking on as if they were a part of this circus act themselves.  So here I was standing in my nice new formals..at crawford mkt from 10 am...hot, humid, sweaty...poor ventilation….no place to sit...and I had to make observations on consumer purchase behaviour..... rite!!!!    I knew it wasn’t going to be easy for me right from the start, when the co-owner (there were 2 brothers who owned it) gave me clear instructions to stand in one side and not bother any of the staff or customers – and I was sent there to be interviewing both sets of people! After about an hour of standing in one side, and putting on a sorry face, I went up to him and started asking very basic doubts. “Aap har roj kitna biscuit/shampoo/soap bikte hain”, “har roj, yehan kitne customers aate hain” etc etc. After a set of 10 such questions he wisened up and shot out directly – ‘tum yehan kis liye aaya?”. Aaah, here was the reason – our man actually thought I was there to spy or something. The stockist salesman had obviously not given him the full dope. So I started explaining how I was a poor MT, who had just joined  and was going to be a salesman and this was my training. Also gave him some bull about how I was from madras and they put me in a hindi-speaking place. After some questions about my ‘MBA’ from hyderabad, he started talking about his cousins shop in some gulli near charminar. I tried showing as much interest as possible and after some more such gossip, he said “ main tumko apne dhandhe ke baare main itna bol raha hoon, tu mere liye kya karega’?? So not only did I have to give him the company brand to endorse me, now I to give him a reason why to buy brand Sunder.  I mumbled some mumbo jumbo about how I could present any problems he had with the company to the concerned people, and how my presentation the day-after was to the head of sales etc. So began another hour of him telling me all about the problems he had with colgate, and the stockist and his salesmen! Finally by about 1 pm we had gotten chummy with each other, and he introduced me to his other brother and his son. I was already drained out.  My last one-hour was spent with Ali – one of the owners sons. Ali was a CA Inter pass, and had always dreamed of doing an MBA. He asked me about my college in Hyderabad, and about whether he should write the CET for Maharastra colleges. So Sunder, MT turned career counselor, gave his best spiel on the Bombay colleges Ali should try for. He asked me about distant education, and I told him about a friend of mine who was doing a distant education program form Bajaj and that it was pretty good. Very excited, Ali asked me to take down his mobile no. and asked me to tell my friend to call him ! Felt like laughing on his face for this demand, but considering that I was in his terrain, I just nodded my head and turned to ask questions to the customer next to me.  That evening I caught up with a couple of isbians at a place called the 80s club in bandra. Felt good seeing familiar faces, each one having a story to tell about his or her workplace. The best stories were of course from the J&J Medical gang who, as a part of their training, had to watch piles operations being done! I already felt better about my retailer stint.

      Arrived at Bombay Airport at 2.30 pm on May 31st, and went straight to the company guesthouse....plush lil place at hiranandani gardens , powai. Met some of my fellow MTs - 2 guys from XLRI (I was only later to find out that my company is full of XL junta) , one guy from IIM A , one from IIM L and my fellow ISBian - AS. Enjoyed the 18th floor view of powai lake and the hills; each of us sharing news and stories we had heard about our company from our respective alums.  My first shocker was when I heard that all us MTs need not be in Bombay for the full first 6 weeks; some of us could get pushed out within 10 days. Got into a state of depression...I thought I would have at least 6 weeks to enjoy the 'bombay' life with the bbay ISB junta before they send us on our sales stint.   Met up with some of the 'seniors' later that night. They were all leaving for their respective stints as District Managers (= to ASMs in Levers) - one guy was going to Bareilley, one to Hubli and one to Raipur. I thought to myself - After a whole year of A/c rooms, 24 hrs net access, sarovar house keeping and 10 lakhs...I’m going to be sent to some cow belt area????   First day at work.....usual HR formalities.... met the rest of the MT gang - one supply chain guy from NITIE, one girl from XLRI, one from Bajaj and one from Pakistan, who was doing her training here. We had another formal session with the seniors at office about their respective sales stints. After the initial bit about how the company training is renowned in the fmcg industry for it’s rigor, and other such words of self-praise, the gory details came in. We would be given sales targets from when we start - Unlike Levers where the trainee works with another sales territory salesman, here we get our own territory and have to meet targets. Heard that the stockist would become the most important man in our lives. Stories of how stockists would take u for a ride, how lonely it gets in barielly; especially when your stockist refuses to pay the money and your boss wants the money like yesterday. After an hour of  "this-is-what-I-did-last-summer" download, we headed for lunch...super cafeteria...reminded me of good ol ISB days... but after all the stories...lunch didn’t taste that great.  Post lunch ...and i got the mother of all news. Out of all the 10 MTS...9 would stay in bbay for the full 6 weeks and one would go to Aurangabad to do the logistics stint at the factory there...and yours truly was the chosen one!!! Down in the dumps was a gross understatement.... After 3 hours and some big time consoling by the seniors.. I let it sink in....I WAS GOING TO BE OUT OF BBAY IN 10 DAYS!!!
