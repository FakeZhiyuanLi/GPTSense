      What is wrong with my ears??? Aargh! I can hear roboty things and recording sounds in my ear. Is this being OA?? OVER REACTING or&nbsp;is this what OLD AGE brings? Hey, I'm only 20 something.  &nbsp;I skipped calling today. Woohoo! I had my hearing test done in the morning. Sad to hear,&nbsp; I still have normal hearing.&nbsp; I don't want it to be normal just for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just remembered after having movie marathon with&nbsp;you know who (blush) my hearing went back to normal. But after calling for almost 2 hours, I'm back to being deaf again! Now... am getting sleepy

      I like to share my thoughts&nbsp;today. Something unexpected happened today… oh yes, it felt so&nbsp;good and scary at the same time. But most of all it was good.. hell yeah quite good.   Today is the start of my hmmm.. how should I say this.. being unsingle again. At exactly 12 midnight today I said yes am all yours baby LOL to a guy who’s been courting me for like what 2 or 3 weeks. He asked me to slip my hand into his if it’s a yes. Which I did right away.&nbsp; I’d like to think I have given him a hard time which is quite the opposite. Haha.. Well I like the guy too that is why. Hmm I should have given him a code name here. I like the name Jack. Yes I like Jack too.&nbsp; It’s been almost 3 months since my last relationship and I’m back on track again. Am I still nursing a broken heart? Is it too early to be on this relationship again? &nbsp;Am I on the rebound? What am I thinking? Am I having regrets after all? &nbsp;Oh wells, what can I do guys can’t help but to fall intoxicatingly in love with me. LOL   But really I’m good, I’m actually feeling a mixed emotions. I’m feeling an intense happiness. It was so unexpected yet uplifting. &nbsp;My heart is in its stage of initial intensity at the same time its pretty scary. Uncertain of the future, excited in anticipation of all that’s to come. &nbsp;I actually caught myself smiling while writing this. &nbsp;I like this feeling of uncertainty. But&nbsp;there's&nbsp;actually one thing I know for sure… I’m in love with Jack!  Is it really like this when your in-love you tend to be shallow, sometimes so deep? And how, I wonder, will this story end?

      This is how i'm feeling 4 or 3 months ago... Well right now not anymore. this is also one of my fave song..  &nbsp;  How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss? How do you rid the sweat, after the body bliss? How do you turn your eyes, from the romantic glare? How do you block the sound of a voice You'd know anywhere? Oh I really should've known By the time you drove me home By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual goodbyes By the chill in your embrace The expression on your face told me Maybe you might have some advice to give On how to be insensitive, insensitive, insensitive  How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch? How do you slow your blood, after the body rush? How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend? How do you teach your heart it's a crime to fall in love again? Oh you probably won't remember  It's probably ancient history I'm one of the chosen few Who went ahead and fell for you I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch I Fell too fast, I feel too much I thought that you might have, some advice to give On How to be insensitive  Oh I really should've known By the time you drove me home By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual goodbyes By the chill in your embrace The expression on your face that told me Maybe you might have some advice to give How to be insensitive

I've never felt this intense laziness when i was working morning shift. Nope not until today. Just wanna sleep all day.. am not really tired, its just that my soul is screaming I DON'T WANNA MAKE CALLS ANYMORE! WAAAAAAAAAA! Sick and tired of me pretending to be an american/australian.. hi this is Andrea Collins calling on behalf... hello my name is Candice Chapman. I could even recite my whole spiel even when i'm sleeping. I've used different names, different games just to get sa sale. I have dreamed about this... Thousands of australians chasing me... australian old age pensioners mostly. Pensioners whom i fooled once? Twice? hehe.. Oh yes Mrs. Cook this is for a good cause.. (oh what the heck! this is really for a good cause) its internationally sold.. 70-90% proceeds of this will go to the "orgaNAYzation"..(yeah right! 70-90% is equivalent to 2 dollars!) this is very elegant i actually bought one for my mom.. since father's day is fast approaching.. hahaha! I can't believed i did that! Hey Deburg Peeps could relate to this one! Please take good care of your heart! Bloody cholesterol! I'm not interested.. is there any particular reason for that? Salesperson gotta be pushy you know. You're a Filipina? How splendid! hahaha Oh yes not to mention -- the brit accent! SAY WHAT??? HEART? ITS HOT NOT HEART! Oh wells i guess i missed my deburg days. How i miss those times! Hahaha.. its soo good to reminisce and laugh my heart out!  EARth to MArs candy! Your not an aussie anymore! Heck your not, its time to pretend being an american. Its time to fool bloody Americans! WAAAA! Back to reality. Hey Candice whether you like it or not.. you're going to work tonight! Shish... Am going to work because there's "someone" to look forward to.. haha.. is this love???
