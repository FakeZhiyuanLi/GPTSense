      I am free Well, not now but soon My heart aches for the chance To step outside of those barbed-wired walls Without the numbers I bear on my chest Without the numbers that steal my soul Without the pain of having to come back inside and See everything that I swore I would never look back upon But should I bother, With the heart-wrenching emotion of hope? I have known men far greater than me That have and lost the battle The battle of chance that I could possibly be condemned to these barbed-wired walls An eternity living by rations An eternity living by work An eternity losing all feeling of entirety Self lost A man does not go crazy due to his surroundings A man goes crazy because he lets himself be hurt A man goes crazy by thinking of his future   Hoping that tomorrow everything will be better But I know better The walls in which I know now are The only walls I will ever know I have no family My only family is in the walls with me Sharing the day to day life of cold Day to day life of callousness Day to day What if I could leave this place? Why can’t I leave this place? Why do I bother trying to leave this place? This place The place to destroy men To bear witness to destruction Freedom comes soon Or does it? I can’t live waiting Live wanting Live waning But that’s how I live Without life Tomorrow will only bring the pain again Why bother with sleep? It will only bring on tomorrow.

      This is a great, great, great song by Thrice. And it's really easy to learn...if and guitar player happen to be reading. If you want to go acoustic with it....Am, F, C, G...like 108 other songs you've seen before. F,F,Am,G on the Chorus. Enjoy  The Artist in the Ambulance by Thrice  late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal red light, can't stop so i spin the wheel my world goes black before i feel an angel lift me up and i open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white they flip the siren, hit the lights, close the doors and i am gone  now i lay here owing my life to a stranger and i realize that empty words are not enough i'm left here with the question of just what have i to show except the promises i never kept? i lie here shaking on this bed, under the weight of my regrets  i hope that i will never let you down i know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound  look around and you'll see that at times it feels like no one really cares it gets me down but i'm still gonna try to do what's right, i know that there's a difference between sleight of hand, and giving everything you have there's a line drawn in the sand, i'm working up the will to cross it and  i hope that i will never let you down i know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound  rhetoric can't raise the dead i'm sick of always talking when there's no change rhetoric can't raise the dead i'm sick of empty words, let's lead and not follow  late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal red light, can't stop so i spin the wheel my world goes black before i feel an angel steal me from the greedy jaws of death and chance, and pull me in with steady hands they've given me a second chance, the artist in the ambulance  i hope that i will never let you down i know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound can we pick you off the ground, more than flashing lights and sound  I highly encourage you to go look it up, buy the album...it's good.

      "If you children feel the ambition, feel free to do the dishes," She said. But in her head, "You vicious little malicious brats destroyed the fictitious life I'd wish for all my life." Superstitions proceeded to obscure the fairy tale of family-life. "And you dad is always away fighing." Stop bitching. I've dealt with you preminition that we are all lazy scum. You never once mention the accomplishments we've done, nor the barriers we've over come. The tension you radiate is making my temper short. I'm about to explode.  The first line is the only thing that was said...the rest would be the thought of one of the kids.

      Because the chances of anyone actually viewing my blog...due to my lack of publicity and promotion I'm sure...This is a poem that I wrote while taking a test. IF someone does read it...don't tell me you did...don't comment on it...etc. It would ruin all point of writing it.  You want a poem where I show you all my fears Analysize it, then decide whether or not I should get praise or cheers Back off...if you honestly think you could do it better, then do it. I'm at the edge of quitting, a hair to saying, "screw it." I hate the time it takes to learn to manipulate my words And to allow alliteration and for whose entertainment?...yours? Poetry and music are my choices of communication I don't give a fuck if it gives you a sensation Or makes you feel that you criticism deserves a standing ovation because the situation I'm facing is causing a sensation of frustration See, I thought the poems I wrote were my internal monolouge Why did you decide to grab the ball and try to ruin them all? Saying, "His style is reminiscent of Nash, Plath, and Poe." Yes, they influenced me, but that's not all I know! I have a brain of my own and I swear that I can use it. To write what I want, where I want , when , and what with. I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I needed your permission Your approval to be creative. So frankly I'm schitzing. There are more voices in my head than any person would want It's getting crowded and I"m trying to kick them out, one by one. What you see in my work and what's there are completly different A difference equal to the distance from here to the next solar system. So stop.

      So why do I care what you think of me? And why must you decide who I should be? And why can't you see that I'm happy here? And what is it about me that you fear? And why do you say that I need to feel The hand of God, a spiritual ideal I don't know why you can't believe in us When this relationship is based on trust And just because we see in different lights It doesn't mean we can't go to new heights You are the one that need enlightenment Please realize I'm writing this just to vent Just listen please, it's you I love But this is not the kind that's from above Because this love is much more than a cliche Look back. Remember once upon a day When we were once ecstatic way back when The sound your voice would make would chill my skin But that's all gone please leave, go and think Of how we were over in a small blink A blink that lasted life times worth of pain Reminded me of the beauty of rain Remember this to thine own self be true And maybe, maybe on day I'll come back to you.  That one sucked too...and sounded alot like the "alone" one, but it was another of those write at 2 in the morning thing...i guess i think i ended a relationship early in the morning. Weird huh?

      How do you write a sonnet about nothing? And get it done before English class Now thought in mind except for one thing If I get a bad grade my parents will kick my ass It'll be hard to do it, I fear Write a poem with no content on a single line The key is to keep your mind clear And focus on making the lines rhyme But my vocavulary isn't all that great But I still think, I'll be able to extend This poem I'm trying to create I'm almost there; I'm towards the end So here it is, if this couplet rhymes I'm done And the battle of the sonnet I will have won.

      Here's another one...i'm pretty much just going to lay out poem after poem in an effort to say i did something w/ my blog.  Your Eyes  When I look at you I see a girl that's incredibly shy But it's hidden under a very good disguise I wonder why this other person you deny When to see I only have to look in you eyes.  That window to your soul that will always supply The answers to my questions, and they tell me no lies WHy is it so hard for you to realize The person  you really are, lies within your eyes.  You act doesn't fool me, (what a suprise) Let  you true colors show, that would be wise. When I see your fake personality, a part of me dies Because I know the true beauty is in your eyes.  Your eyes that always seem to cry Because no one know the truth of y ou demise You're scared to show your charm, but why? When it bleeds through your eyes.

      Here is a poem i wrote at like 2 in the morning two years ago, but the people in my class liked it. The reason for this is probably because it is insincere, cliche, and stupid. However, i guess it could be a good poem...i just think it sucks... so here it is.  Just let me be alone, just for a second The darkness much better than the light As shadows fall across your face I see The face of evil trying to take Reality away from me. Please, Please Just let me be alone, I can't believe How could you be so mean to me? How could you try to pass it by As if I didn't notice. If I could I would change every thing about that day The way you had to lie and hide. The way I treated you like you were not my love But now I want to be alone. Just let Me be. Just let me be in loneliness. The pain inside has turned into my life. I really want to leave it all behind, The more I see your face, the more I want To be alone. Because it's all I have. It's all I have, my love just leave. I need To Be alone to think about where we Now stand. I see that time we spent is gone, And now I want to be in here alone.

      This is going to be a story about a banana. I told my friend JR to write about a banana slowly rotting because he wanted to write about something, he declined, but told me to. So then i'm going to use it as a pseudo-metaphor for society, and the American family...i promise, i don't really mean that.  Laying on a plate that you have no respect for, thinking that you are the best part of anyone's life. Feeling great. Knowing, just knowing that someone will enjoy you, be able to take away your outer self and see the inside, the real you. As moments pass by you must control your state of mind, reassuring yourself that someone will be there for you, but time passes on. As Days pass you must convince yourself that someone will be there for you...soon. Signs of age have set in and you know that your not as attractive at you once were, the chances of companionship decrease with each passing second. This time will pass, everyone loves bananas, they will hold me in their hands and pull me close...enjoy every part of my body. But yet you wait, and nothing happens. Feeling ill, feeling less. Signs of wear are exploding from your face, and you don't even appreciate yourself now. The plate, once so insignificant to you, is now the only friend you have. You give up your thoughts of love, knowing your time will never come. The slightest touch from another restores once lost hope, until they too cast you aside in the garbage. You see only dark from the bottom of a well. Feeling nothing.  That would be the whole banana thing...now JR, write your version of a banana.

      Well, here we are...the first day of my blog. Wow, i'm not really excited about any of this. I think that anything i say will have no effect on your life, not make you think, nor will it help me fell good in anyway, but it just a thought. So i'll probably do some updating eventually, not that i think anyone is reading it.
