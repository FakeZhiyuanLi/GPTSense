Damned shoot outs! Next time i bring my 12 gauge shotgun...we'll see who wants to mess with me...all over a hot chick too...DAMN IT!!! *sigh* oh well...fun times....i got the bullet:D hehehehe....it still hurts like a bitch and i can't move it all that much...but i suppose it'll be alright in the next few weeks...i have to take some pills and the doctor shoved a long ass needle in my shoulder...that hurt like a mother fucker...stupid counteracting lead poisoning:S oh well that's my story, if you'd like to know more ask me on msn...it's not biggie i just can't type very fast!...buh byez

      Well i dont know what to say, i guess i'm sick and tired of being jealous because that's simply how i feel. All my friends are in relationships, and now they don't want to have anything to do with me. I never thought it would affect me this much but i guess i was wrong. I'm to put bluntly jealous of my friends, i'm happy for them but i'm jealous of them as well, i'm at the breaking point. I'm getting sick and tired of being the one to keep their relationships in one piece. I want my own, not leech off of someone elses, but from what i think i'm not deserving nor good enough to have my own. I'm left behind lost and forgotten my mom bitches at me for always being on MSN and my computer, well quite frankly if she knew what was going on she'd be bitching and interrogating me even more. *sigh* i raise my hands in defeat, i don't know what's wrong with me, but obviously there's something, otherwise i would'nt be in this predicament.   Another thing that's going all wrong in my life is that i can't stop being a moron. My mom admitted today that she thinks i'm a fucking moron. well i guess the next worst thing that she can do is kick me out of the house. I think that's what&nbsp;she wants so i'm not going to give her the opportunity, i dont know where i'd go but i'm going to run away. I can't be around her or my friends anymore, and it's quite obvious they can't be around me either. So i may as well fulfill my destiny and go die on the streets, because i have nothing left...Why arent i loved by anyone?...i mean i give up, i've been turned down by soo many girls that i dont if i can bare being turned down again, i'm&nbsp;going into my seclusion again, i dont&nbsp;talk to anyone, no one ever talks to me, i wish i had some verbal contact. I want to here people speak,&nbsp;see their emotional reactions, rather than just seeing meaning less words on a 17 inch monitor. I wish i had a companion, i wish i had a friend, i wish i could have someone to just listen to my&nbsp;rants, i wish i'd be able to see there emotional, and physical reactions to this. I'm turning into a cyborg, half man, half machine.&nbsp;Of course this is all just a&nbsp;dream because in Reality my wishes would never come true, hell&nbsp;i'll never be with anyone in the future, at this rate i'm going to be single for the rest of my life...you're thinking (well duh with that attitude)&nbsp; but i've tried the positive attitude that hasnt worked, now as&nbsp;i sink deeper and deeper into a depression i think, "Why Me?"....&nbsp;

      Have you ever gotten the feeling where after truly getting to know a person you become obsessed with them?...You don't nessesarily like them but you're obsessed with talking with them, there are a few people i know that i feel this way with, i really dont understand why though, i mean can a person truly become obsessed with anotherone's life?...hmm i wish i had the answer's to life's questions oh well lol back to playing poker...felt like i needed to rant!

      Well today was extremly uneventfull, the only thing that was worth telling was that i talked with Kally. That was interesting, ironically i can't remember what we talked about...oh well, i'm sure i'll remember in a bit...hmm another thing i did with my boring day i took my dog to the groomers. The little bugger scratched my wrists and made me bleed,&nbsp;oh well i'm ok, i didn't die from it. Although i'll probably die later from shooting my foot off at the range. Damned rifles never shoot straight! so ya thats my blah for now, i'm not sure what else to write really, oh well off for now...

              well i was thinking about alot of things today, more about the first time i met alot of people. It just doesnt seem right. I mean i had so many chances why did i pass them up? Why do i have a misguided soul. It's hard, because within me there's a battle raging between my heart and my mind, my soul however is being innocent. I'm not all that sure what to do, i've passed up too many chances in the past. My heart tells me to do one thing, and my mind says something else. Why do i have to be this way?...Why am i broken inside. Why Can't anyone help me find the missing pieces to the puzzle that is my ghostly life. I&nbsp;just dont get it, from my Dad leaving two years ago, without even saying good bye, To my friends&nbsp;betraying me, i dont know who to trust anymore....or even if i&nbsp;should trust anyone.&nbsp;I dont know what&nbsp;to do, maybe i should just go into my corner and just be secluded for&nbsp;awhile.&nbsp;

      Breathe in right away, Nothing seems to fill this place I need this every time,  Take your lies get off my case Some day I will find,  A love that flows through me like this This will fall away, this will fall away (Chorus) You're getting closer, to pushing me Off of life's little edge Cause I'm a loser And sooner or later you know I'll be dead You're getting closer, you're holding the rope and taking the fall Cause I'm a loser, I'm a loser, yeah  This is getting old,I can't break these chains that I hold My body's growing cold,  There's nothing left of this mind or my soul Addiction needs a pacifier, The buzz of this poison is taking me higher This will fall away, this will fall away  You're getting closer, to pushing me Off of life's little edge Cause I'm a loser And sooner or later you know I'll be dead You're getting closer, you're holding  the rope and I'm taking the fall Cause I'm a loser Well I'm a loser  You're getting closer, To pushing me  off of lifes little edge Cause I'm a loser  And sooner or later you know I'll be dead You're getting closer,You're holding  the rope and I'm taking the fall Cause I'm a loser  You're getting closer, To pushing me  off of lifes little edge Cause I'm a loser  And sooner or later you know I'll be dead You're getting closer,you're holding  the rope and I'm taking the fall Cause I'm a loser  Well i think that song suits me well, i mean hey the only person that actually doesnt think that is a thousand miles away. I really wish people would just accept me for who i am, not for someone who they see. I wish people would get to know me, rather than just judging without even&nbsp; saying hi. You can't judge a book by it's cover, i dont understand why soo many people do...these little rants must be getting annoying. So i bid you adieu!

      Well i've been thinking about my future, i'm really not sure what i should be doing, on one hand i can go into the military become a soldier and probably die in some far off land, on the other hand i could become a diplomat work for my country, the United Nations, or NATO, and try to keep the dying peace in this world. I'm really not sure what to do with myself anymore, have i really given up?...i'm a lost forgotten soul that's searching for it's place in this giant world. Perhaps given time he'll find his place among the stars, and be someone...not sure where i should go with this, but meh, after highschool it's bye bye to everyone i once knew, everyone i once cared about, i'm not sure i'm ready to do that i'm not sure what i should do, anyways back to my happy place...where maybe i can relax a little and live a little more.

      I talked to Kally for almost three quarters of the night. That was great, i dont know why or how but i sense she actually cares about me, that makes me feel a whole lot better. I've only known her for three days and already i've told her things about me that no one not even my best friend knows about. She's a real angel, and i'd trust her with my life. She talked me out of doing the deed and she actually showed she cared. That's proof that she really is a good friend and she really does care. I still dont know what higher power decided that deserved to meet her, but i can say i thank them with my entirety, i dont think i could have ever met anyone soo amazingly stunning, with such a great persona, someone who cares about each and everyone of there friends, i still dont understand why fate led me to her, nor will i ever really, i mean wow, she's amazing in everyway possible.  *end rant*  Well two of my best friends are comming home from their trips today...YAY!! I can't wait to see them. I miss them alot, but oh well, they're lucky i'm not...i've got a good friend that's online that i can always talk to!(i think you know who you are) anywho that's my rant for now, lets see if any other crappy events come up today

      Well i went for a walk this afternoon! I had to clear my mind of various things. I had to just get out of the house, and try and get away from all the bad, and let in all the good! Although i guess there isn't very much good to let in lately. I'm hoping that'll soon change. While on this little walk of mine i wondered what i'm going to do with myself in the future, other topics i wondered about were Prom, Graduation, and my last year to improve my marks so i can get into a university. I really dont know i'm confused about alot of things, mostly of what i've written in here, i just hope that Karma will soon be on my side. I've had alot of Bad Karma lately, and well i just want to have something good to happen to me. I'm getting sick of everything else thats been happening. I've got to much bad and not enough good! and it's beginning to get to me, and unfortunatly i think my "friends" have been noticing it. I've found that i can only be my real self on line because i'm to afraid to show me for what i'm truly for, i guess that's why when i'm online people can actually relate to me, because i'm showing my true self, and letting my emotions loose. Scary thought Eh?...I've taken to writing alot too, although none of my works have been completed there can always be something to add to them. I'm currently working on a fiction/non-fiction story of my friend and I's life and how we became good friends.&nbsp;  I think i'll go to my special place now. I feel the need to get away from this reality....

      Well today i've come to the realisation that i'm alone in the world. No friends, a family that thinks you are the shitiest person in the world, and various other things that have been included in my half lived, forgotten, shitty life. My so called "friends" dont accept me.   I Met this amazing girl the other day, her name is Kally, we have soo much in common. Only problem is, she lives in a different country and the odds of seeing her in person is slim to none, that saddens me greatly because i think that a strong bond is forming, or has formed. I can relate to her in ways that are unimaginable. It's funny the people you can meet through friends.  I can't wait till my friend Tiffany comes back from florida, she's one of the most amazing people in the world, i dont know what i'd ever do without her by my side. I wish i could see her more often&nbsp;but it's understandable why i dont. She's busy with her friends, and her&nbsp;boyfriend, i hope things are still going well between them. She sent me a postcard, that really surprised me, i really was'nt expecting anything like that. Oh well, she's a friend and i certainly dont mind receiving something like that from a good friend. She's probably one of the only friends i have left. I wonder if she'll ever read this,&nbsp;meh oh well not to worry.&nbsp;  I really dont know what to do anymore, my thoughts on suicide are becoming more frequent, and i have a feeling that i might do it in the near future. I really dont have anything left to hope or live for. I'm dumb, stupid, retarded. My friends think so, I think so, My parents think so. What's the point of living?...Is there a point in life? What's my problem? why do i have friends who enjoy betraying me?...i really wish i knew the answers to these and so many more. I wish i could just find someone i can relate to and who honestly truly cares about me. I'm tired, tired of people judging me on the way i look. I'm tired of being targetted as a human verbal(and sometimes physical) punching bag. I admit i'm not normal. I'm me and sometimes i wish people would accept that. I try my best at everything but i cant seem to succede. No matter what i do it always seems to end in failiure. What's the point of going on?...it's not like i'm going to meet someone who might someday be my wife! HAHAHA that's a funny thought me actually going out with someone and ending up marrying them like that'll happen. Ha!  I had another premonition last night, this one was about my death. I've had it before and it's becoming more frequent. I'm really not sure what to make of it. It's beginning to scare me.  Anyways i think that's enough for my first post, i'm going to go cower in a corner and try to make sense of the hell i'm living in.

      Wow, i'm beginning to sound like a love sick puppy, i've come to the realisation that my love life sucks, i've fallen in love with my friend, she means soo much to me, her life hasn't been the greatest, although she always seems to be able to put on the sweetest smile. She's the biggest sweetheart and i feel that no matter what i do, i can never cheer her up, i try and help but it's as if nothing works, i'm there for her and i guess that's all i can really do. I love her to pieces and all i want is to see her happy, i want her to know that i'm always there for her, but it's hard when we rarely see each other. I hope that'll change soon though, as i'll be working my ass off on our friendship. anyways back to the topic at hand i love her i cant tell her the typical sad love story between friends, oh well we're good friends and that's what counts! I'm just confuddled about it all, she's amazing! anyways i'm oust i gotta think this over a bit more.

      Well Yesterday i had the best day ever. I met up with my friend Tiffany who i havent seen in over a year. It was soo great we talked so much and that just made my day. Only problem when she left to go home, i felt as if i had lost a part of me, a part of who i am. She's one of my greatest friends and i'm afraid of losing her again like i did. I'm not to sure what i should do, we're both going to be extremly busy this year as it's our graduating year and i just want to be with her. I dont want to lose contact with her for over a year and never see her again. She means to much to me and i think she knows that. Right now i'm lost and dont know what i can do exactly to counteract this feeling of loss. I wish we could see more of each other, hopefully we will in the future. I love her to much to let her go.

      I never came here looking for a single soul. But now that I found you I want you to know I had forgotten how to smile, how to laugh, how to be me I had forgotten the sweet pleasure of a heart filled with glee. I was intoxicated with life... work and family Never stopping for fun... it just wasn't there you see. Since I have found you... it's been a complete turn around I smile and laugh again... not much gets me down. I get excited when I see you on MSN Listening to your Cheerful self again... Chatting, laughing and the games we play You make my every day. It seems so silly on just a machine How someone can reach you... become your everything.   Empty...That's how I feel without you. Every day that we're apart Feels like an eternity. You move me... Make me feel things I thought I would never feel again. When I am with you, I feel a warmth wash over me. A warmth unlike any I have felt before. It picks me up and carries me to a far off place, A beautiful place... A place where nothing is known but love and caring. My worries fade to a distant memory, And all but you is forgotten, If only for the moment... My heart is overflowing with joy and love, The joy that you bring to me, And the love that I feel for you. Never have I come across anyone like you... Sweet, warm, tender, caring... I become overwhelmed in your presence, lost... Lost to my imagination, to the thought of you. I'm lost in a wonderful dream, and I never want to wake up. You... You are too good to be true... My Damsel in Distress. The woman I've been searching for... The woman of my dreams. And now I have you, Yet I cannot have you. To see you would be heavenly, To touch you, divine. I want to share my life with you... You are my waking thought And the last thing on my mind As I drift off to sleep at night. You fill my dreams with visions of happiness and love, Visions that linger on and carry me through my day. There is a longing in my heart That someday we will become a reality. I want you with every fiber of my being. I need you as I need water, or food, or air. I miss you every second of every day. And for everything that you are to me, Everything that you will ever be, I love you...

      I found this Poem on the net, i figured it describes my situation a bit better.  Purity once had a name, And beauty once had a face. Life once had a meaning, And once I was safe. Once there was freedom, And once I could laugh. Happiness once was alive, And once I had another half. Once I shared her love, Once I was by her side, Once I felt I fitted, So quickly that died. Her grace so great, Her beauty so vast, All I ever wanted, Was for it to last. Fate maybe had another plan, Or maybe she had another love, But it all fell apart, The hand too big for the glove. Now it's all died away, Happiness, joy, love; all memories. Now I walk alone in this dark, dark world, With no light to guide my way.

      I'm swimming all alone in a pool of darkness and I feel like darkness is slowly pulling me under I yell for help but no one is there to hear it I begin to see the water at eye level and I kick and flail fighting to stay above the darkness But the darkness won't let go of its hold on me and I slowly begin to give into the feeling that lies below the water line the waters starts to fill my lungs the lungs that once held so much life yet now they allow the murky water to replace that I know that this path doesn't lead to happiness But why doesn't someone grab my hand pull me from darkness's grasp? because no one knows I stand at the boundary the boundary between light and dark so I give in to the thing that holds me All of the strength and all of the courage that I once held in my heart can't save me from the water So I slowly slip below the world of conscientiousness undetected by the occupants of that world I don't want to fight anymore I've given into darkness  There's no one left to save me from my personal hell, i've given up on life, there's nothing i can do to fix this shit that i'm going through, no one wants me around, my friends abandon me, i'm lost in a jumble of emotions and i dont know what to do. I thought i had everything under control, but i guess i didnt i've no collapsed in on myself, there's too much wrong in my life and not enough right...i just want to be accepted, i dont want to leave my family but in dire times i rather that than be in a 10 by 10 cell...my soul is dead, and my body soon shall be as well. I've gone into a relapse and i'm not sure if i have the strength to fight it this time, i cant take the problems anymore, Suicide isnt a solution but it will set me free! why me, why cant i just be like others, why cant i be normal, what's wrong with me. What have i done in my past life to deserve this. I want to be with people, but all receive is being alone. I cant take it any more.  No one hears me, understands me I speak in silence hoping that someone will see my words, my message hoping to find love, it has arrived so divine I wish for a stronger, better life filled with everlasting touchI dream the future, but hold the past My body is brimmed with so many confusions Am I really here experiencing fullness? I must be, the pain is so real the hurt I feel could never be imagined but I will pull through into greatness and destroy whatever faces into me As I struggle I will fight until the end Whenever it may come  I will try and cope with whatever strength and piece of mind i have left.....
