Mmm im so hungry, they r cooking spag bog and thats exactly what i feel like eating right now. OH about the party last night ..it was so fun. There was the fat fire that we spent half the night sitting around. We got there at about 9:30..Me n Joelle were gonna go to a doof afterwards but when we were leaving the party we were all too tired and really couldnt be bothered ..The party was fun enough. Maya turned up at about 11 or 12 or something..i dont remember, i mean i hadnt been drinking but i still dont remember what time it was. The set up of the party was pretty kool. i mean they had a dance floor with kool lights n black lights n shit. And then they had the fire with lots of logs n shit to sit on...And it was just kool.  Joelle is out in the lounge room near the heater so im gonna over there. check.

It was a pretty good setup there and there was a fat bonfire. Today I have to collect for the salvation army at 2pm, I'm taking my new puppy..yeah, I got a new puppy...it' s cute ey shegs?   Shegs: Yes, very. *nod nod*  Yeah, shegs is here. Arrrrgh my lips hurt, they are all cracked. Shiva just asked if my top lip was swolen, UM NO IT'S JUST LIKE THAT!! THANKS!!!!! *sniff* TT_TT Anywhoooo, you should have gone Benji, we had SO much fun!! We got free alcohol off Jeremy and beer dude (don't know name) Shiva just informed me his name was "Murray". Yeah, so next time you should go, actually you shouldn't because we have corupted your poor little EE mind enough and James will get angry. HAha bogan. Lol, you are so stupid Maya.   Ciao,  ****JOELLE**** (formerly known as her great Joelleness, overlord of the universe) .............&shegs.

           today was like the best day.. i dunno y all i did was hang around, i just relaxed and thought about stuff (yes i do have a brain strangely enough) and you know what i realised? i realised i should start being happier again, trying at school and just be the person i used to be before i discovered alcohol, boys and going out all the time. So here is my pledge to become a GEEK (EE) again. I cant wait i feel like a nice person again YAY seriously i am not going to be bitchy anymore. woohoo so here is the new simona *waves hands* "hi" luv the "new" sim xoxo

           Shiva made me update, she is so cruel. *whimpers* Haha, joking.  Shiva stayed the night her last night, which was -interesting- to say at the least. Now we are watching "Star Wars"  hahaha. This holidays I'm going to sydney and staying on oxford street which is cool because Simona and Maya are staying there too.  I have to save up LOADS of money to buy manga, might buy some anime too, while I'm there.  Benji's friend James told me about some place where I can buy lots of Manga, which is cool. It's the strike today, that's why I'm not a school (thank bloody gawd).  Oh, this weekend I'm going to go to a doof in MainArm and also this party in Ocean that's on Friday. They should be fun. We were going to go camping but tonight, Friday and Saturday...but that didn't work out. Oh well, must go..  nye..?

Okay, I feel stupid.. my sister just informed (with a lot of "DER's" might I add) me that it is sheep.. =_=;  Joelle: What the fuck is mutton? Akira: ER.. it's sheep! DER der der der derp!! hahaha. *snort* Joelle: *thwack*   Yeah anyway, she look like Gogo from "Kill Bill"  (the exchange student I mean).

       Joelle: This thing is quite annoying, but cool. I like the look of my livejournal better though.  If you want to see that you can go to: http://www.livejournal.com/users/jopet/     Anyways I volunteered for the salvo's today, which is cool.. so did Maya, Benita and Simona.  Oh and I wanted to apply for the world vision study tour but I didn't raise enought money. :'( I'll apply next year though.  I am getting my L's on Thursday and I got my car the other day..more good stuff. Shiva and Benji are going to come up to the land and drive it soon, my car I mean. I'm entering this graphic webdesign competition through school, if I win it will be a good thing to help me get a scholarship to uni, I wanna do an arts degree and visual design/illustration. I'm going to make the webpage by flash and hand code, which should be challenging but fun. I'm also supposed to be getting a call from this guy in Byron from some animation studio who maybe had some work for me. The guy from NBN tv station saw some of my work when I was doing work experience there and he told the animation people about me. I hope I can get a job there, I really need the cash.  It's actually supposed to be a job for ..you know, old (er) people, but he think I can do it.  Otherwise I will be doomed to work at the supermarket or somewhere equally YUCK.  btw Benji: that post just before was explaining what maya meant in less cruel words.

       Noushi:  (on behalf of Maya, Simona and Jo.) Hello and welcome to our BLOGSPOT BLOG. hehehe. *snort* Just to get this straight. We are NOT stupid and do not like being called stupid. Furthermore our school is not stupid, alot of people in our school are really really smart and lots get over 90 in there UAI's.. but we also have the stupid people which drag us down. It is quite Immature to generalize, really.  Also Maya and Joelle got highest in the year many times in year 10, and furthermore Joelle got highest in English, Geography, History etc. on practically EVERY test in year 8 and 9, and maya went well also. *snort* Joelle also got 100% in 7 assesment test in year 8 and Maya got 100% in 4 tests.  lol. And yeah..Joelle got accepted to one of those selective schools when she lived in Brisbane.. but chose not to go. Joelle. Maya and Simona *choose* not to work as much as other, and study all the time in year 11 because it doesn't count for anything and there is more to life than SCHOOL, school SUX. You only live life once, why waste it by STUDYING!? *shudder* Just because we don't go to a EE school and study all the time doesn't mean we are not academic. Pfft.. not mature, like you can talk.  WHO was looking at porn on Danyells login...BENJI!!!!!!!??????? LOL! just kidding.  Also, well I can't say much for Simona, but Maya *cough* (she made me put that in) and Joelle do CARE about real shit and politics (although they would like to stress that politicans are evil.)   Sincerly, Noushi. (evil minion of Joelle and Maya.)  p.s. don't take this fully serious or anything Benji ; )

On Wednesday 30th June, Andrew Ross will be sharing on his visit to World  Vision's Indigenous Program in Papunya (270klms north-west of Alice Springs)  When: 		Wednesday 30th June 2004 Where: 	World Vision Queensland Office 		Level 3/ 3350 Pacific Highway 		Cnr of Murrajong (entry) & Paxton Streets Time:		7.00pm to around 8.15pm (light refreshments provided) Cost:		Nil, All are welcome (we encourage you to invite others, but you  need to confirm 	numbers) Enquires:	07 3387 2700 to confirm program & attendance  Hope to see you there, Theo Masselos and team   ^ I'm going to go, who else wants to come?  *gets ready for some EE bashing from Maya & Simona*.... *sigh*     p.s. for Benjita-   Amon might be there.. *wink wink* *nudge nudge*

         Just in case you didn't know, a written copy is dur TOMORROW!!  First paragraph:  Good afternoon Mrs Thompson and class,  Establishing a utopia would be an ideal solution to solving mankind’s problems.   We currently live in a world full of greed, apathy, hate, corruption and extreme inequality. As a result millions suffer. Suffer from being ignored by the rest of society. The capitalist way of living has failed, taking with it countless victims of poverty and neglect. It is therefore my belief a utopia should be established, mirrored from Thomas More’s novel “Utopia”.

         Ahhhh so much to do....so little time......stupid exams/assignments!!  Joelle, we are holding something of yours at ransom...... I'm coming to your's at some point tomorrow (did you ask Kerry about that thing for me?)  so you may get it back depending on how embarrasing it is to ride through town with (no it wasn't Akira).  The Ext Eng (no i haven't started I am starting in about 10mins) question is:  "Establishing a Utopia would be an ideal solution for mankind's poblems." Prepare an argument for or against this topic, basing your arguments and examples on the set texts "Utopia" (I have now lost any hope of getting the whole thing back.....lol) and "Brave New World".  3-5mins.   I am doing for, just to be annoying and difficult seeing as everyone will do against.  I got my room 1/2 set up (the rest of my stuff is lying around outside hehe) and you don't know what extents I had to go to to make sure my parents didn't look in the couch draws (orange ex bed thingo) i literally had to argue with dad over why we shouldn't move the bed thing with the draws taken out. ahh scarey.  Brianna has Avian flu now. AND my nose is soooo sore from all the crappy recycled tissues we have.  Tata peoples. ~benj

       They are releasing the LAST lot of tickets for Splendor tomorrow (Saturday 19th of June) at 9am, but I'm lining up in the morning, maybe 5/6 am. You need drivers license/ proof of age and proof that you are a local resident. You can buy a maximum of 2 tickets per person. They are ONLY SELLING the 2 DAY TICKETS! They are $112 a ticket + booking fee (don't know how much this is)..  We should go! It would be so fun!

       OKAY I HAVE TO EDIT THIS BECAUSE I WAS NOT CLEAR: I was not being serious about being all pissed off at Simona etc. after the whole  'telling people to shutup joke' today at school.   >> Must stress that: Certain parts of  posts and comments were NOT serious, I was being stupid and thought you would pick up on the jokes because of the subtle things like: "Simona, evil as she is.. >=)" "simona stinks" and my smart ass tone "removed from certain activites" "generalising, theory"  Do not take it to heart...  The whole thing started with an inside joke between Shiva and I on msn.   Your lord and master, Jopet.

        It has come to my and Maya's attention, helped by a certain post on joelle's blog, that certain members of the group are feeling somewhat detached from certain group activities. Certainly this comes as a certain worry to certain group members involved. (No more certains... I promise).  Agreeingly, Maya, Simona, Jeremy and I *have* been going out on a more frequent basis, of late, however, I completely disregard the belief, for me and Maya anyway, that we are intentionally "barring" Shiva, Joelle and Danyel "off". I think it is that Maya, Simona and I are better (or actual) friends with Jeremy which means a car, which means more places available to go and more implusive "outings". For example, the other night at the doof, we left because, yes Jeremy *was* tired, and drivers' decisions are to be held in up most regard, however upon the change in scenery, Jeremy was able to regain a healthy mental capacity....ie not tired....(with the aid of a crappy driver reviver coffee) and we impulsively just went out again.....spur of the moment decision.  But I can understand how that could give the impression of us barring you off (and similar occurances).  I don't think anyone can actually remember the "going up town" episode.....so its not some form of petty "revenge" for that.  But as Maya said (Joelles blog), we didn't realise you felt like this......and will try to keep it in mind so we can all be a group and everything will be all rosey and corny ;)....... seriously though, sorry guys.  ~benj

         Brianna wanted to call the dog "Roxy" (so I started to call it "brand-name") but thankfully dad convinced her not to....so it's still no-name.....or "Bait" to me ;)  ARGH we have basketball tomorrow......shall we remind Jai of his promise?? ( I can't believe I was the one who actually made him promise to wear a shirt.......hopefully he was too out of it to remember(that it was me..not to not wear a shirt)....oh and he owes Maya $3) eheehee.  I'm actually going to do some homework......seeing as someone *glares* made me not get home till like 11:30.....hehehe Oh on the drive home from Maya's we saw a HUGE snail......like we nearly ran over it and Im like thinking "that looked like a snail" and Jez (bad, now blue, hair...) goes "did you see the snail??" And yeah IT WAS A HUGE SNAIL I never knew they could get so big.....cool or what (that's been the favourite story of the day). Oh and Maya the Scarey hippy gypsies should be gone soon, I think they were there for the whole Venus-going-over-sun thing (or the Durumbal Venus dance party last weekend), so you won't have to scream and lock all the car doors!! (crap!!! you didn't lock the boot after you got Grizzley out....we could have been killed by the stick killing hippies!!!).  Stupid Danyel wasnt here today, and lonerised me with the fuckwits in Senior Science. Patrick and Brad (i think thats what they're called) are annoying the hell outta me- keep going "HI BENITA" so next time I'm gonna be like "OH..MY....GOD........there's a MASSIVE spider on your head Patrick" (cos thats the dude who I've heard is arachnaphobic (sp??!) Mwhhahahahahah Colli is sooo gay *cough*.....we have to go to Hastings Point on thursday to look at a bunch of rocks or something with the Bio class FUN FUN FUN......I'm soooo dropping it ;)

Bear (my puppy) is starting to really stink..bad and is still humping things. *shudder* Why are guys so friggin' horny. *sigh* I really should have stolen those boots from the party, I so regret not. Erg that party was crap. Matt from Kempsay is getting SO annoying. =_=; It was so funny when you yelled at him Maya, do you remember..haha, thanks for that. Anywho..long weekend this erm..weekend. I think there might be a movie marathon on, if so I'll go to that. Maybe there is another party on this weekend and we can get tequila again!!! ^^ Tequila is sooo good, I can't believe you don't like it Simona and Shegs!  Weird kids. It was my grandma's birthday today so we had dinner at her house. I was so bored I actually watched Neighbours AND Home and Away!! Help me Beeeenji!!!!!!!

(a.k.a an anime Joelle wants to watch) Must steal that. . . . I have to do a new body of work now for art, all the media's suck. I'm thinking either video (installation) or sculpture. I also have this stupid English discussion thing I have to do, let me tell you.. public speaking SUCKS. Really.  Anyways I want to see that movie "The Day After Tomorrow"  if that's what it's called, it looks interesting.  What to do this weekend???  I am not drinking, considering last weekend's party, hahaha that was fun.  But yeah, according to Shiva I was really weird and funny that night, which isn't a good thing...apparently.  Aaaaah, headache.. need one of those Thai "pain killers" hehehe...        B Y E

         I'm writing this out on stickies (man I love em...) anyway.....I just have to blog about the fact that i burnt my lip AGAIN last night.....and it was the marshmellow's fault AGAIN. I was in getting a hot chocolate, as you do in this freezing weather (not looking forward to mountain weather....brrrr) anyway I decided that i wanted the 3 last marshmellows that were temptingly sitting on the bench. I put one in my hot chocolate and cooked number 2 on the gas stove...waiting about 10 mins "just to make sure" it wasn't too hot, before eating. All good so far. Then I go to cook #3, and getting a bit lazy I only wait about 4 mins for "cooling time" before shoveling in my mouth.....now little did I realise the "stick" the marshmallow was impaled with was actually a metal prong, having an entire absense of an actual stickish make up... i.e wood. Now it is apparently a well advertised fact that metal has a tendency to, actually, heat up when kept in hot flame for a prolonged period of time (ie the the time it takes for my marshmallow to become appealingly black and charcoal-ish). Unbeknown to me at that current time, the "metal prong" happened to be quite challenged in regard to an acceptable temperature for my mouth. So, in keeping with the laws of reason, I received a rather large whitish burn on the left side of my bottom lip, which complements the now peeling, series of other whitish burns on the bottom of my bottom lip (which I can know endeavour to chew off), left from my last rather eventful episode, involving a marshmallow, gas stove, fork and a small explosion.    Common sense must now beg the question..........How *did* Benji pass primary school?

Kas is so annoying she is like the biggest fashion victim ever at the moment.....Jeremy picked us up from the airport the other night and we went to Cavill for food and she like has to get a skirt and lip crap and perfume on before she gets out.....*rolls eyes* god..... she's so in love with herself.....anyway she's nagging to get on the internet AGAIN like this is the first time in how long ive actually been on....so i better consider getting off.  Dad got an ibook and creature speakers they're sooooo good....and we are getting broadband soon...yaya....oh and apparently we have an office space above the Mullum flower shop (near Santos).

         Yeah that sign on book at school is soo cool.....I did the same on friday when I turned up halfway through english (period 2) - sure ive been at school since 8:40!  I have fire bridage training tomorrow morning and its so crap cos both Mya and Michelle aren't going (Mya soccer and Michelle the unco broke her leg so that means i won't have a buddy the entire time Mya is in Germany grrrr). I guess ill have to hang out with Luke whatshisface and the other retards *shiver*. Oh and I must not forget Beaver. ewwww *signs*.  Yeah Maya remind us to teach you the sign for "well" me and Sim learnt it last night...its really cool.  I guess i *should* do some work seeing as I have done absolutely none since school went back (I live each week by going "2 more periods to stay awake for" then "2 more days to survive till weekend" then "7 more weeks till holidays" unfortunately I dont seem to get that its "5 more weeks till prelims" and like 1 more week till the first wave of assignments are due AND more scarily 9 MORE WEEKS TILL YEAR 12 AHHHHHHHH.  On the other hand its only about 4.5 months till Woodford!! ;)

       okay well today was a pretty good day... had a free first period so i went to school for second and then signed on saying that i got there at 8:40am haha ya right... anyway  i shldnt have signed on coz we only had eng, phys and chem... eng i went to but for phys and chem me n momo went on the oval across from skool. It was very nice lying in the sun thinkin of other ppl sitting in a cold dark classroom mwahaha. I got some rash thing from the grass tho (it's alright it's gone now).  Joelle made up some optus transcript.. which was quite funny... she can add the questions  to the blog later.. well anyway this prank of ours allowed for joelle to ring ppl up (even ppl we didnt know), only if they had optus tho of course and make them go through a demented set of questions which was part of our survey... the catch was that they could win $10 worth of credit! ehehe. Renee Gallard was just one of the victims and she actually believed it (joelle went through every question) she even thought it necessary to lie about her name - calling herself Michelle. Most of the others caught on to what might b happening. :(   I also got to go around in a wheelchair at lunch and show off my "wheelie"  whoop whoop. I brought the wheel chair back to Adam after that.. neways then in maths (which YES i did attend) i was punshed for being late but later i explained my reason (she apologized) but she continued my punishment of havin to sit next to Phoebe! with the excuse she was makin up for all the other times when she hadnt punished me!   4 more days of yr 11!! whoop whoop!! sooooo good... I think i will change my German exam from wed to like monday or tues.... coz then i wont come to skool on wednesday at all... the only class worth going to is maths AND that wld mean only 3 days left of yr 11!!!   I fixed up my room a tad too the other night.. got the stereo outta Oma's room and set that up with the speakers.. and got the speaker (top shelf) stereo system (middle) and my comp (bottom) so that my comp can easily just plug into the stereo.. anyway it kool (WELL I LIKE IT!) :@ :'(  rightio i off  later blog

Megs like "what site is this" the other chick " its my and my friends website"  meg " what you can get a website" in a totally surprised voice but its just a blog thingo , cept its skyblog or sumthing. I was gonna tell Meg its called a blog but then she might think im listenin to their convo... thats how i got the idea to  write in this... shes writes in this weird belgiumy writin ....  i was tryin to read it before when she was writing an email but i cldnt read it.. anyway that is all really not  important.           shegs   is still bludging school, Danyel is on a drama camp, joelle is sitting 3 computers away from me, Simono is sitting 2 comps away from me and Krisitin is sitting 1 comp away from me (next to me) We have some sub teacher who like knows me ... eek anways i really really need a drink.

        The best thing that happened was at the end of sunday night when everything was over and we all walked over to those stall thingos near the big tent and this security gaurd told us we had to go out and shuffled us in the other direction, so we walk of and Kasi goes to Mya "dare you to run past him" so the next thing we know Maya bolts off and then you see this big security guard chasing after her and her screaming while he tackles her, her going "im joking IM JOKING!!! as he seriously pushes her in the right direction.

        Yeah splendour was cool. Grinspoon were pretty cool, esp seeing as the mosh pit was like psycho....i nearly died. But Jurassic 5, Ozomatli, 1200 techniques and Sneaky Sound System were my faves. I haven't been online in sooooo long. Checked my emails twice in the last fortnight- both times at Joelles.  Tuesday=really really shit day (both extension subjects) AND $1 movie night at Video Ezy (which we all just love don't we grrrrrr stupid new rule about having to have ID cards grrrrrrr).

      I've got to start putting together a portfolio soon. It's hard though, because I don't actually like that much of my stuff. Here is the newest thing I've done, it was rushed..so it's kind of messy and sucks.  I shrunk it down alot, you can see the full version at my deviant art gallery. (see below) This was based on a horseriding accident I had:   By the way, I fooked up the writing..so ignore it. ^^;

      I'm really really sick of all this fucking studying, I tried to study for my Advanced Math test and I go shit anyway.  I cannot wait until the holidays, I'm going to Sydney for the first week and the second week I plan to bum around, draw and stuff..maybe start putting together a portfolio for my art and ring my mums friend Bob Smith (an artist who did the storyboards for the new Peter Pan movie) so he can maybe get me a job drawing story boards.  I REALLY need a job.  I don't want one of the usual, boring, cleaning-fat-out-of-the-chicken-frier-at-the-supermarket job. I should have taken that job awhile ago..teaching kids at the youth centre how to make webpages.  I am -so- retarded.  I really want to do this animation course at Griffith, it looks really interesting. Wow, alot of my sentences start with "i"    My grandma wants to buy Aki and I a laptop each..yay  (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) She Probably wants someone to direct her spoiling on... now that the "golden boy" (my cousin Juno) has moved to Sydney..and it's about time. I mean, he only has:  FROM WHEN HE LIVED HERE AND WENT TO HIGHSCHOOL •his own television •cd player •millions of clothes  •surfboard + wetsuit •Probably an Ipod or something similar. •random cash handouts • TRIP TO JAPAN!!!!!!  + STUFF  SINCE HE HAS MOVED •Laptop •Rice Cooker  •wok •a whole lot of other cooking junk •random large handouts of money  ALL FROM HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just coz he is a stupid lil suck up... *grr*

      "Tomorrow.. where will you be?" The story begins with Palaeoclimatologist, Jack Hall who predicts the coming of a new Ice Age. Fossil fuels contribute to global warming, global warming melts polar ice caps, fresh water "desalinises" The North Atlantic current causing extreme weather conditions and ultimatly the end of life as we know it. Although he predicts these events to happen in the next 100-1000 years unless action is taken, after a sequence of extreme weather conditions the global warming catastrophe seem closer than he thinks. Tokyo is struck with bucket-sized hail, New York suffers a tidal wave which wipes out half of the city and spectacular toornadoes destroy LA.  "The Day after tomorrow" is everything you'd expect from a disaster movie: drama, teen romance, stupid herioc acts, cities being torn apart/ flooded/ frozen and the usual cliche's like when Sam (Jacks son) outruns a towering wall of water and later a fast-moving "snapfreeze" and don't get my started on the whole going to New York to save his son. What exactly is he planning to do when he gets there, you think? And when he DOES get there...what does he do? Yeah, that's right..NOTHING.  Luckily the stunning overload of visuals effects make all the bad cliche's bearable, mostly. One thing I must mention is the wolves, pure crap. Not only was it a very bad cliche that didn't fit in at all, the CGI failed miserably.  It's politics however, enviromentalist bush-baiting and the fact that America suffered a whole lot of demolition in the movie(DIE AMERICA DIE!!! mwa ha ha),  amused me.   But I am being cruel, because I actually did very much enjoy the movie there are some spectacular destruction scene's,  I loved the tornadoes in LA and the Hail in Tokyo was interesting. (no, JAPAN!! my precious!!!!) So go see it now..  p.s. If they had have cast someone hotter as Sam then it would have made the movie a WHOLE lot more interesting.

      We went to the doof the other night. It was pretty fun except Simona was being really immature and bitchy. Like when I was trying to ask her something she told me to "Shut the fuck up and go away" even though I hadn't been mean to her or anything, I was just saying we should go dance or something (can't quite remember)...and she thinks Shiva is immature. ¬_¬ Jemy n them had to leave early because Jemy was "tired" but they ended up cruising around Bruns or something. Hmm. Anyway *sigh* I'm going to the movies tonight with Aki and Kerry to see "The Day After Tomorrow"  I'll review it on here afterwards.  The lunch with my grandmother on Sunday was fun, I just hung out with Billy and Oden (my cousins) and Zoe (my other cousin, 26, pregnant.) is SOOO  big now! She is due in mid August, I bet it's gonna be a girl! After it was over I drove home from Bruns, which was fun.

      I was fully ready to get out "Brave New World" and "Utopia" and start reading them this morning, seeing as I have a 5 minute speech due on both the books for Extension English. Not only do I have to stay after school for an extra 2 HOURS (!!!!!!!) every Tuesday to please my ego-obsessive, powerhungry, thinks-she-knows-everything-but-can't-teach-for-shit    teacher, I ALSO have to do public speaking AND read the most boring book of all time, Yes..I am refering to "Utopia". Everytime I see Mrs Thompson (the ego-obsessive, ph, English teacher I mentioned earlier)  she gives me this like.. evil glare. She is either planning to kill me OR is a little upset just because I may have forgotten *cough* to attend a few *cough* of her extenstion classes. Maybe both.  So anyway, I pick up my book then decide to.. you know.. quickly just check my email etc.  ....2 hours later when I pull myself away from my computer (*hugs her mac*) I find that I have LOST the books!!  So I spend a further 20 minutes trying to recover the books. I don't find them... go figure. So then I decide "fuck it" I'll just study for Math (which I also have a test on because all the teacher are evil and synchronise their assesments so they are all end up due at the same time) and I can't find my notes. So now I'm not doing anything...just sitting here blogging, which is proving to be very amusing.. and listening to some J-rock. Aaaah I love Japan.  So it's 12:14 now... I've done nothing... except this post in my blog... and breakfast... etc...  ..and for your amusement: te he ^^;      Love your lord and master.. Joelle.        ..p.s. PC's suck

      I didn't go to school today, I was sick and tired. We had a short day, so it doesn't matter..I guess.  School is crap.  I better start doing homework and study so I'm ready for the preliminarys. *sigh*  After school Benjitamatron and Simono came over, we ate -so- much icecream.. it was scary! >.>   .>  We also watched White Oleander, I love that movie but it makes me sad. Benji is gone now, Simona is going soon. She is..  Her mum just arrived.   She's gone.  . . I'm all alone!! TT_TT Heh, I'm really busy at the moment, I still don't have time to draw which is pissing me off because really that is all I want to do..it's the only thing that makes me happy. :3  Akira just got home. She got her hair cut!!!! It looks cool! o_0  It's all short and flippy-out-ee.   I might dye my hair brown soon. Maybe this weekend.   My mums coming back on Sunday. I have to clean up. :(  The house is so trashed. Kay, I better go make dinner.   Peace.

      I hate the world today.  I feel sick. I have a headache. I am too poor to go to woodford.  I am too poor to get new shoes.  My teeth hurt.  I really want to go to woodford. I have too much homework. Every day is the same. School sucks. I don't have time to draw.  I don't have time to work on my site or forum. I am always tired. My eye's hurt. Preliminarys are soon.  I want to run away and live in Thailand or Japan.   On a lighter note, if I need to get glasses in the next couple of year, I wanna get purple contacts. >.
