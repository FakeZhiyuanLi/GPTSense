      Dear Woman,  When I created the heavens and the earth, I spoke them into being. When I created man, I formed him and breathed life into his nostrils.   But, you woman, I fashioned after I breathed the breath of life into man beacause your nostrils are too delicate. I allowed a deep sleep to come over him so I could patiently and perfectly fashion you.   Man was put to sleep so that he could not interfere with the creativity.   From one bone, I fashioned you. I chose the bone that protects man's life. I chose the rib, which protects his heart and lungs and supports him, as you are meant to do.   Around this one bone, I shaped you..... I modelled you.   I created you perfectly and beautifully. Your characteristics are as te rib, strong yet delicate and fragile.   You provide protection for the most delicate organ in man, his heart. His heart is the center of his being; his lungs hold the breath of life.   The rib cage will allow itself to be broken before it will allow damage to the heart. Support man as the rib cage supports the body.   You were not taken from his feet, to be under him, nor were you taken from his head, to be above him. You were taken from his side, to stand beside him and be held close to his side.   You are my perfect angel... You are my beautiful girl. You have grown to be a splendid woman of excellence, and my eyes fill when I see the virtues in your heart.   Your eyes... don't change them...   Your lips, how lovely when they part in prayer...   Your nose, so perfect in form...   Your hands, so gentle to touch...   I've caressed your face in your deepest sleep...   I've held your heart close to mine...   Of all that lives and breathes, you are the most like me.     Adam walked with me in the cool of the day, yet he was lonely. He could not see me or touch me. He could only feel me. So everything I wanted Adam to share and experience with me, I fashioned in you; my holiness, my strength, my purity, my love, my protection and support.   You are special because you are an extension of me. Man represents my image, woman my emotions. Together, you represent the totality of God.   I love you, my most precious woman !!   Sd/-  G O D     Remember..... "What you permit, you promote !! "

      This is the transcript of an ACTUAL radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October, 1995.  Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.  Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.  Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.  Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.  Canadians: We are a lighthouse. Your call.    Now, that is what is called a CLASSICAL PARADIGM SHIFT.. !! LOL   Sudhar jaao, bhai...    Cheers !!

      I am tired of telling everyone... Shreyas is indeed a unisexual name. It just means well-being, goodness. Its usage cannot be restricted only for the fairer sex.    This has been one name, which has fascinated me to no end... It generates positive vibrations all through the body. Another such name is "Shubham", again means well-being, goodness   Cheers !!

      "Where the mind stops, the spirit begins" ...  "Buddha was not a buddhist, Jesus was not a Christian.. All these religions are man-made. You need the religion only to a certain extent. After that, you don't need any religion" ...   If you can equate religion to a fruit (say banana), the peel or the skin denotes the customs and rituals and the fruit contained inside denotes the values of the religion. The customs and rituals are needed just to protect the value system. Now-a-days, people have left the values and are just hanging onto the customs and rituals without understanding their essence.  ********************************* MOTD: All the misery in this world is because of the ignorance of the difference between happiness and pleasure. *********************************

      Yes, once in  a while I do have this unsurmountable desire to write on NOTHING.. yes, you read it right, NO-T-H-I-N-G... it is nothing. LOL !!  I did not have  any particular topic or issue or words in my mind. Just felt like giving vent to my literary genius and write or rather type or rather bug someone!!  Since I felt that my sincere intentions and feelings would not be understood by anyone, I thought I'd rather just blog !!  As I type this @#%^*^!*&$ out here, I have an eye on the clock.. second by second.. its getting closer to lunch... not that I need someone's permission to go for lunch, but I think its within decency limits to go out for lunch during lunch time.  Today morning, I went about 20 mins early to the air-ticket collection office. Lucky me, I had the radio on my mobile. So, could spend time without much difficulty. Everything was going on well, until.... yeah until... this silly looking lady walked into the office. I told myself.. "Oh my God! what a character". Well, let's stop here.. The other things I thought of are not worth posting here.  After a few minutes, I switched off my radio and looked around and saw "Token # 218" being flashed at the screen. "Good heavens !! How can they do this to me. I was the first person to walk into the office. My token # is 216. How can they ignore me like this." I walk up to the counter and horrors of horrors ... it is the same lady sitting at the counter, beaming the broadest smile she could and ask me "What is your token number, sir?" "216", I blurted out. "I have announced that number twice, sir. How come you did not hear that?". "Because, the sky is so high", I thought to myself. "I was a little preoccupied, sorry about that", I told her and handed over the papers. "Gosh!! does she know what she is supposed to do?", I tell myself.   Anyway, cutting that silly stuff short, I did manage to get my work done and came out. I think I faintly heard that silly lady telling something to her colleague and giggling. There are not many decent people out there anymore. Atleast I did not talk about this lady with anyone. (I know, there's somebody saying... Look, who's talking )   I even don't know what I am doing right now.. Do I really have to know. As long as you (yes, I mean you. The person who is reading this right now) are smiling now, who cares.  Catch u l8r  Cheers !!

      Yeah man,  All the Yahoos, Rediffs, (and a whole list of email providers ) make way for the latest Internet Czar - "Google"..   These guys have really put in their heart and soul in designing the functionality, GUI and stuff like that..   And probably the best part of the service is the authority with which they say ... "Who bothers to delete email... " I love it.  And yes, I managed to register an alternate account with Gmail...   Cheers !!

      " Try to control your breath with your mind, before the breath starts to control your mind.. "   The whole essence of 'pranayama' - a breathing exercise is based on staying in a thoughtless state by retaining the inhaled breath. Indeed when you inhale and just retain the breath, it is quite difficult to "think", especially disturbing thoughts don't dare enter you...    I find it especially useful..  Have a nice day guys  Cheers !!!

      Yesterday, I was talking to my friend and he had absolutely no doubt that kaliyug was going to end pretty soon.  He quoted so many examples... Prajapita Brahma Kumari's say that kaliyug would end round about  2009 AD. Mexican Calendar doesn't talk about existence beyond 2014 AD. Even Islam doesn't have a calendar beyond 2029 AD.... and the list just goes on..   He opined that now is the time to do your 'karma'. I read somewhere on some website that we are now indeed beyong kaliyug.. I'm confused. Need a cuppa hot coffee

      Yeah, the more I think about it, the stronger my conviction becomes that the education system isn't just good enough.  Just tell me how much of education you learn in your high school, you really use in your daily life (after an age of 24-25). Why go that far. How many of us think that we made an informed decision after our school as to which professional stream we must take up? How can we take that informed decision if we are not capable of making that decision.  Honestly, I feel we are better off going back to our good old 'Gurukul' way of imparting education. These days the schools, colleges (atleast a huge majority of them) are there only to ensure that the children get good marks (no to mention about the publicity and other stuff) !! Yeah right, tennis also is just about hitting the ball onto the other side of the court. Wish it were so simple.  Somebody reading this having some ideas.. do drop in a line. I myself have this dream of opening a gurukul school and try and get the best of the educationists under one roof. Am not sure if I am capable of doing it or not.. I even don't know if I have the resources to do so. But someone who is capable and has the resources should do it  Cheers !!

      Hi,  Yesterday, I was watching this serial on TV... and there was a father counselling his daughter as to how she should keep up her relationship with her husband..   He said that two people in a relationship should be like two feet of a human being.. when one foot goes ahead, the other stays back and supports the first...    Found it to be very meaningful.... it goes out to all you guys/gals who think their relationship is going nowhere... stepback (literally), and give some time and space for your mate...    Cheers !!

      How true !!  I was speaking to my mom.. watching some serial on TV. She told me that Yashoda brought up Krishna till he was 12 yo. After that, he moved on, killed his maternal uncle, got married, did 'Gitopadesa' to Arjuna but did not come back to see Yashoda.  Upon asking, he told her that it was all she deserved in that lifetime. But in his subsequent avatar as 'Lord Venkateshwara', she is born as his mother, 'Vakula' and gets to see his marriage.  After that the Lord grants her 'moksha' and since then she has adorned him as a 'tulasi-mala'....  MOTD:  You ask him what you WANT, he grants you what you NEED  Cheers !!

      Yeah, I was at the event where the book titled "Yoga 4 You" was released for the general public. Dr. C. Narayna Reddy was the chief-guest and was requested to speak after the inaugural of the book. Whatever he spoke, I believe was extempore... and just superb..  He spoke in Telugu and was telling how the word 'yogam' is used in other words... samyogam, viyogam, prayogam, upayogam, abhiyogam.. .and so on and so forth.  There was another gentleman - Mr. Varaprasad Reddy, Shantha Biotech - MD and he was mentioning about&nbsp;a German scientist has done research on how Indian classical ragas were found to cure diseases and ailments. He spoke so fast that we could not take note of them. I sure will meet and find out the names of the ailments and their corresponding curing ragas..  Overall, it was a enjoyable event. Couldnt stay on long to listen to the cultural programme that followed. Was getting late for home... twas my mom's birthday as well !!  Cheers !!

      A crime is committed in 1989, the accused is convicted of the crime in 1990 or thereabouts.. the convicted appeals for mercy and the saga goes on for another 14 years before the convicted is finally sentenced to death... sounds pretty awful... heart-rending....  Going by norms of life imprisonment in the Indian Penal Code, the convicted has already served a life imprisonment sentence. As if to prove a point or more of rubbing salt onto the wound, he is put to death. All credit to the judiciary of our country.  As they say, "Justice delayed is justice denied". It took 14 odd years for the judiciary to execute a death sentence of a criminal. Now, thats too much of a wait for anybody. Come to think of it. The poor criminal has already got his bit for commiting the crime.  The judiciary is setup to kill the crime, not the criminals. Yes, there are some criminals who deserve to be executed but how many? Do we give the criminal the oppurtunity to realize the crime he has commited and be remorseful of it or just finish him/her up?   Agreed, in some cases there doesn't seem to be any reason why the criminal should be allowed to live. But how many times does this happen especially when the criminal has already served 14 long years in jail...  Any judges, juries reading this... comment plzz  Thumbs Down...

      As Newton said, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite action". In similar lines, what comes has to go. Its a universal law.  What stays is something that has been existing all through.  Sounds happens, silence returns. We have to accept that what has been existing all through is SILENCE... the eternal TRUTH   Cheers !!
