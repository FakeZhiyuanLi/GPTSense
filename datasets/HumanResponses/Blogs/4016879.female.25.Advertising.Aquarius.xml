						   Previously to today, the best compliment I'd ever gotten:  "She has hips you could do coke off of."  -- Josh W. (describing his then new love interest to his friends)  Perhaps some qualifications are needed here. First of all, those who know me may describe me kindly as "pear shaped," ok? If you don't know what I am talking about here, forget about it,  you skinny bitch . Really pear shaped. As in, skeletal collar bones sticking out, little waist and...uh, really wide hips.   Second, he was describing this to his fratboy friends. See where I'm going here? The fratboys I have encountered have only dated size 6 girls at the very largest. And there he is, a fratboy, telling  other  fratboys that this girl had curvy hips - indulgent, sinful hips. (side note: I don't care for fratboys in general - I find that the fratboy mind-set and my own are mutually exclusive. Josh was the rebel boy in the frat, if you will, dating gentiles with hips and so forth. I do like a rebel...)  Consequently, Josh was the lucky recipient of my best taunt:  "Josh, you bastard, I hope your Neon falls to pieces."  Ahhh, he inspired such passion.  So Josh, you've been replaced. The compliment holding no.1 for over 6 years has fallen. Fallen to:  "You aren't a mild person in the least. Your personality is chili-pepper spicy, Momma-sita."    Great, no? Who wants to be mild, everyday vanilla? God, what a boring fate. It's nice to be assured that you aren't just a passionless, lukewarm, mediocre nobody. I would rather be a terrible nobody who raises hell than a pretty good nobody citizen. It's not that I want to be famous or remembered - I just don't want to go through life without making a wake.  Josh W., if you ever happen to see this, you asshole, and you know who you are, send me a line. I hope you've made it, and I'd love to hear what you're up to.

						   I ate the last diet pill I'd been hoarding for months today.   Ephedra - lovely stuff. I started using it in college. I'd take one 15 minutes before I would have to wake up, hit the snooze, and go back to sleep. By the time the alarm went off again, I was so charged I had no trouble getting up and trotting off to class. Necessary for 16 to 19 hour days, months on end.  Because some people have used ephedra irresponsibly, it's now illegal for purchase in the US.   Ok, people died.   People die drinking alcohol. People die smoking, right? People die eating fast food. Congress doesn't get their panties all twisted up about alcohol, cigarettes or whoppers do they? I'm so pissed! Just give me back my diet pills!  So, I ate the last hoarded diet pill and figured I'd have to order some online and have it shipped. (you will  not  thwart me damn it) And I found, get this, the only site selling them is a site that also ships psychedelic mushrooms to your door. They only take euros, and send it to you in a nondescript brown package. Believe me, I'm considering it.   I'm thinking I should become a bootlegger. I'll smuggle in the best ephedra pills from Canada and sell them to collage kids, weight lifting fanatics and middle class mothers. I could do it on the weekend. What did they say in business school? Find a need and fill it?  Looks like I'll be taking a trip to Canada shortly to buy my contraband.

						     You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else, but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and bought&nbsp; a house that needed furniture, would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace. --Frank McCourt  Angela's Ashes

						       A very good friend of mine never puts a&nbsp;mark on the first page of her journals. It's too much pressure -&nbsp;the first page is going to define the following pages, set a standard. It wouldn't due to have sloppy penmanship, a misspelled word, or&nbsp;not to mention a poem that&nbsp;you'd find so ridiculous in six months that you'd just want to burn the whole thing.   So she skips the first page.  &nbsp;

						   Why really is the french press so cool? It's uber euro name? The superior brew it produces? No. I disagree.  The french press is cool because of the plunger. Mechanically it's a lot like syringe, it pushes the coffee grounds to the bottom and all the delicious black yum to the top. At the first sip, the body relaxes - then spins off into a whirlwind of excitement and happiness.  I'll never be able to give it up. Never. Never. Never.

						   Motherfucker.  I just lost about forty five minutes worth of writing to an unscheduled computer failure. Not that it matters, dear singular reader. (Mother)  I should note, now that my ideas are lost forever in a black hole computer virus vortex, that it was probably the best writing I'd ever produced. It was, arguably, damn near the most fastenating essay on blogger. Probably one of the best literary works of the past 100 years.   And now I'm quite jaded about the whole situation.

						   I  met the most fabulous manicurist today. I haven't had manicures before, and thought I should start. What excuse should I use for this indulgence? I'm a big girl now. I deserve it.    Normally I despise the encounters I have with these beauty professionals. They ask me questions like: Gee, are you a student? or Have any plans for the big weekend? Yawn. Please, please, please don't ask me to chat on about myself. Just cut my god forsaken hair. We don't have to talk. Ok?  Jeanie is from New York, or pretends to have that accent anyway. She is the most cynical, angry and bitter woman I have met in a long, long time. Someday I want to be just like her.  She grabs my hand and starts to file.  "Oh hun, you got nice nails. Pretty ring. Beautiful. You know I used to own this place. Not anymore though, and I hate what they've done with the decorations. It used to look sophisticated. Yeah, I just hope that the people who come in don't think that it's always been this way. Square tip or round?"   It goes on like this as I ask and she tells me all about how she got into the business, bought a store, loved it, retired to spend more time with her husband, and how he died a month later. She went back to work to get her mind off of it.   "Gawd. If I can give you any advice at all never get married and never have children. People get married just to have drama in their lives.  'Oh how I hate this serenity.'  Please. I have four girls and they all live here. I wish one would go live on the east coast and one would live on the west cost. It would give me a reason to travel. The best thing I ever did was get a hysterectomy. I told my husband 'I'm getting a hysterectomy.' he said 'I'll get a vasectomy.' and I said 'No, you don't understand - I don't want to have another kid. Ever. No matter what happens. I'm not kidding.' Here put your hands in this dish sweetie."    She talked about politics:  "This was when you could just go and ask for a hysterectomy. Not like now. Gawd. The nerve of these doctors. Now you have to go to medical boards if you want something like that done. And  they  tell  you  if you can get a hysterectomy or not. You know what? It's my body and if I want a hysterectomy, you better give it to me. It's just like abortions. You are telling me whether or not I should be having this kid? I'm the one who has to take care of it!"   Her children:  "They all got married, and now they're all divorced. I knew it, I tried to tell them. I knew it wouldn't work out. What did I get? ::whiny voice::  'But I love him. Your keeping me from my love.'  Gawd. It was different when I was getting married. I didn't have sex with my husband before I married him. He was lucky he got to touch my boob."   Weddings:  "Now everyone lives together and then wears white. ::tisk:: It's ridiculous. I hate going to weddings. They're all the same. Look, if you have to get married, don't  throw the bouquet . Don't do the  father/daughter dance . Don't do that thing with the garter. Gawd. Where's the originality anymore? It's shameful.   Husbands:  "They don't really want to help take care of the children. They say they do but they don't. They  pretend  to help. That's all. They like pretending, but really they don't want to have anything to do with it."   Then she told me that I really should do something about my eyebrows and if I wanted, she could wax them right now since her appointment was late.   I am so addicted to her. The only thing missing was a cigarette dangling from her mouth. Considering the flammability of the materials she was working with, I guess I didn't miss it.

						   Last night was a blue moon, the second full moon in a calendar month.   Coincidentally, my boyfriend asked me to marry him. After five and a half years of talking about it, surprisingly, he has taken action.  I have been hoping for an engagement for what seems like ages. I've pouted, demanded and feigned disinterest. Then, on a business trip to Chicago, I decided that I wasn't really interested in getting married. You see, it occurred to me that if I got married, I'll have to get a house. And a dog. And produce a kid. And probably have to learn how to cook. Getting married, it occurred to me, could quite possibly ruin my carrier.   So, the gods laugh.   That same week, during my business trip to Chicago, my boyfriend realizes that, "Whoa, we've been dating for 5 years. The perfect moment to ask for her hand will never, ever present itself. I guess it's time to just do it."   The gods laugh harder.   When I came home the house was clean. There was Champaign in the refrigerator. There is my favorite meal on the stove. Clean sheets on the bed.   The gods are rolling now.   And he asks me. And yeah, I said yes. (albeit a little irritated) Trumpets roar, streamers fly, rejoicing and singing and drinking follow.  The evidence is below.
