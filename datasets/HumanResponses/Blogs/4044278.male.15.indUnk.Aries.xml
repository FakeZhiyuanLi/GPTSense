      It could've been more work for one day than i probably could've handled, but it didn't quite get there.  Thank God.  Bandcamp was enough to start off with.  Actually, today wasn't as bad as yesterday.  Yesterday it was like WHY ARE WE YELLING?  LOUD NOISES!  But today was like good job guys, you've suprised me.  Mason was expecting us to show up today, on a saturday and totaly just not give a crap about anything and screw around the entire time.  When we went out to the practice field, i was scared that he was going to expect alot more than i was willing to give, but the second he let off the hook way early i knew it wasn't going to be half bad.  We were supposed to do millions of push-ups, since we messed up on meeting freshmen, but after 17 or so he told us to stop.  Right then i was like, ok, today should be no problem.  I like it when Mason's like this, he's really easy about everything and not about to crap his pants cus we messed up a little bit.  But if we suck then that's the way he gets.  Today wasn't really a major screw up day for the band.  I guess he was more leinient than he normally is since it was saturday, cus we didn't really do that great, from what i could see.  Charles, i love the kid, but he needs to learn how to march.  His shoulder's go everywhere when he marches.  I know, i should probably give him a little more slack since he's a fish, but i don't know.  There might be alot more fish doing the same thing, but i can only see Charles.  He's right next to me.  But yeah, me and him are buds.  He's got some weird little friends from North.  They were talking to me, i don't know what the hell they were trying to do but i was wearing my coppell west band shirt and they were like oh, so you're from west? west sucks.  And so naturally, being the manly man i am, i got right back up in their face and bobbled my head around and said uh uh, no you di'int.  Just kidding, i'd never do that even if you payed me to.  But anyway, i really just told them that west rocked and told Charles to back me up and he was like... uh i'm from North too... but west isn't bad, east is the worst.  And i was like thank you man, see girls?  Even your friend Charles here says that west isn't that bad.  So they were like wha'eva.  And i gave them the hand.  THEN, since i'm such a freaking showoff, i whipped out my solo for this year.  There's a pretty flashy part in there that goes really fast and sounds complex.  Before i even played it, they looked at the 4 measures straight 16th notes in awe and asked if i could play it.  I then accomplished the task with sure ease, and they were forever more forbidin to doubt my origin from west a weak one.  Even though me and Ryan are more self-made, studying with ebie for so long.  We're still good though.  Yeah, so that's the bandcamp part of my day pretty much, nothing TOO special going on there.  When it finally lets out, a sudden rush of freedom to do whatever i want the rest of the day and all sunday flows through me like a jolt.  But then i soon remember that i'm doomed to mowing two yards later on.  Yes, a scedual from hell- bandcamp, yard, yard.  Geeze.  And the high today is 95.  As i'm writing this, i've already done one yard, but the other one has been rescedualed to sunday.  I'll do that before Jen comes over.  And i cannot wait for her to.  That is going to be so much fun.  We're going to do so much while she's here.  But i'm sure you don't really want to know about that in more detail.  Do you?  (retorical, don't answer)  Alright, good, so it's still a no.  Ok, well i'm gonna go now, you have been informed what my day has been like.  I'm still waiting for Jen to get on so i can talk to her for the first time today.  She's out having a good time with liz though, that's good for her.  Alright, well more later.

      Hey guys, i'm in a good mood. Probably cus of the shampoo in the shower. Man, that stuff is good, it's some Lever2000 Morning Rain or something. It smells good for like... 10 min's after you get out of the shower then it's gone. Better than nothing. All fresh, i am. That sounds like something Yoda would say. Weird. Never again, also. Yeah, so i'm really tired after another day of the old BC. At least the pre-get-back-to-where-we-were-last-year part is over. After rehersals this morning i was so tired. But i got to come home and spend the next 3 hours or so talking to Jen. Doesn't get much better than that. Then it was off to practice in the bathroom for 15 min's or so before night rehersals. Then so when i'm getting dropped off, my mom mentions that we're going to have pizza ready when we get back... so i'm like, OK! So that was basically all my motivation to get through the rehersal. When i got there Ryan gave me a Thousand Foot Krutch cd and an Anberlin cd. Many thanks to you Ryan. I'm almost done with the TFK, i'm on faith love and happiness right now. It's not bad, but i remember you telling me Bounce is good. So i guess i'll get to that one when it comes up. I want to hear all them first. Skipping around messes up the order. You know? You can't keep track of them as well, and it makes that song you just skipped to sound alot gayer. Well... maybe not, but it messes me up. Jen had a block party tonight, i'm sure that was a blast... right now she's in the shower washing the bug spray off her... that's nasty, i hate how that gets all sticky after a while and starts to smell really funky if you sleep in it. Trust me, on cook-off's we have to cus of the mosquitoes. We try to mask the odor with the cheap pine scent. Doesn't work. It just makes it worse. Speaking of which, my dad's on a cook-out right now. I'm not too sure where he is, but i'm sure he's having fun. When i was driving my mom home tonight from band rehersal's, she told me that dad called earlier cus he missed her, and i was like that's good, at least he's not a  total  a-hole. This time, it's him, dave, and dave's wife, kelly. Kelly made something fancy in a castiron pan... which makes you wonder, exactly how fancy can that possibly get? Something like scrambled eggs or something. That's what i have in mind. Oh yeah, and she brought a dutch oven or something... In MY terms, that's when a guy and his wife are in bed and the guy wakes up first and they're both under the covers and the guy farts really quick, hops out of bed then quickly covers the wife's head under the covers so the smell wakes her up. That's what a dutch oven is to me. Ok, lets do the sound-effect for all the girls really quick... ewwww. Good, moving on. Right, bandcamp. The late rehersal was killer. Just the fact, that we have to spend it with Pace is enough to throw-up over. WHY? WHY SO SLOW? We can at least go up to speed if we know the notes... right? Last time i checked, you go slow when we first get the song so you don't mess up. After you have it for a few days we can kinda sorta  maybe  start to push the tempo a nudge, eh? Oh well, i'm tired... again. Jen's comming over on sunday. Good times will be made. Hopefuly... if she ever gets around to asking her dad! Just kidding Jen, take your time, i know you will eventually. Alrighty bud's, nightio. More later.

      Well, Bandcamp.&nbsp; That's the first subject today.&nbsp; Started at 8... ended at 1240 or so... later we've gotta be back up there to pass off music that i don't know.&nbsp; GREAT DAY AHEAD!&nbsp; Alright, so we're there at bandcamp on the practice feild, aka- a parking lot.&nbsp; Right, so Mason decideds that it's a good idea to make us open our arms out in a straight line with them.&nbsp; So, both arms are straight out for like 10 minutes, then we get a break of horns up... then it's back to what we were just doing.&nbsp; Now after we don't yell "OUT" together for like 2894880 times in a row, we do push-up's until we learn how to together.&nbsp; We then say it together&nbsp;after we do a&nbsp;set of 20, but this isn't good enough for him, so we do 10 more, say it right, and then do 10 more before we get off the hook.&nbsp; Relentless  would &nbsp; be the word for today i believe.&nbsp; My shoulders hurt like shit, sorry if i offend, and i just feel so tired.&nbsp; And the thought of just going back up there for 2 and a half more hours is killer!&nbsp; Damn, well at least the wether's nice.&nbsp; That's one thing to be thankful of.&nbsp; It's better to be cool and humid than hot and humid... or just hot period.&nbsp;  But also today, we were in a boiling hot room with The Winkenator's breath and lucky ryan got to run around the cool hall's the entire time.&nbsp; Loser.&nbsp; But by the time everyone crammed in our already hot room, he was back.&nbsp; When he asked what he had missed, we told him the good part, when we played through each scale and each arpeggio.&nbsp; I would feel jealous but... he's got lessons with her again today so he can just have a good time with them then.&nbsp; And keep in mind, that's in an even smaller room with her and her breath.&nbsp; You can't really smell it unless she's talking directly to you or playing on your freaking horn.&nbsp; So yeah, good luck ryan, best of wishes to you.&nbsp; Ok, now later on when all the fishies and seconds came cramming in with us, charles, my fish buddy, came over and shared a stand with me.&nbsp; It was cute.&nbsp; Anyway, we were there and mrs wenck wanted me to play the region music for everyone to see how far i could get and i got like, half way through the second line of it and messed up on an articulation.&nbsp; So i was disappointed in myself there for a few seconds, but soon got over it.&nbsp; After me, she was looking for a freshman to play as far as they could with not messing up.&nbsp; I was yelling and shouting, to some degree, for mrs wenck to call on charles, but she didn't.&nbsp; When he asked me why i wanted him to play,&nbsp;since i messed up on it so soon, i told him -It's not really that hard, i just suck.&nbsp; That was followed by laughing, and of course, ryan heard.&nbsp; So, being the already, loser he is, he incorperated it later on in a comment about why i couldn't get a rythem down in our show music.&nbsp; This was followed by more laughing and me telling him to shut up, like always.&nbsp;   There you have it, another tiresome day in my shoes.&nbsp; The crap i've got to put up with every day.&nbsp; Lordie.  More later, promise.

      It's freaking late and i don't even know why i'm on this thing.&nbsp; I should just get off right now but it POURED today.&nbsp; My goodness, that was incredible.&nbsp; I wish i could've sat out there in it or layed next to my girlfriend in it.&nbsp; That's something i want to do sooner or later.&nbsp; Lay out in the rain and share a kiss.&nbsp; Don't know why, but that just seems like it'd be a little cool.&nbsp; Maybe i'm a freak'o... they could call me "wack'o-trav'o"... except i wouldn't molest young children.&nbsp; Crap, what am i talking about?&nbsp; I need sleep, this entry means absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Why am i writing it?&nbsp; To bore the reader?&nbsp; Or maybe they're already bored.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they're thankful this is amusing them for the short time it takes them to read it.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; Check out the intro to spiderman, the first one.&nbsp; It's pretty good stuff, i wanna see it again and write it out and put on here sometime.&nbsp; Yep, i'm wacko travo alright.&nbsp; Ok, well i'm signing off now, later.&nbsp; Got bandcamp tomorrow morning... bright and early.&nbsp; Rise and shine, wacko travo.&nbsp;

      Alright.&nbsp; So today i had my first day of bandcamp.&nbsp; Superduper dude, i know.&nbsp; Well, to be honest, it was more annoying than anything.&nbsp; I mean, Mason was pretty funny there twards the end (i'll tell you more about it later) but overall it was just a bunch of review.&nbsp; Which is ok, i know i could've used it but i just thought it got kinda old fast.&nbsp; I know today and the rest of the week is more to get back into the routine of stuff but i just wish it could be more fun at times.&nbsp; Oh well, i'll cope.&nbsp; As long as we start the actual routine on monday.&nbsp; I have a feeling this year is going to be fun marching, but the music is going to be hell.&nbsp; I don't know, whatever works, i just want to beat my cousin's band at L.D. Bell.&nbsp; Grrr..... dirty nathan.&nbsp; Just kidding, i sounded like kelsey smegner right there.&nbsp; Never again guys.&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; But yeah, so next year we're going to have to be really good.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that freshmen aren't going to march this year.&nbsp; But... to make them not feel so bad, they'll probably going to make them shadows.&nbsp; They follow you around and march in your spot pretty much except when you trip over them all the time.&nbsp; I really hope we don't do that.&nbsp; They should do that for the freshmen, and give eachother a shadow and just leave all the upperclassmen alone.&nbsp; I don't know what they're going to do but i'm sure they know what they're doing.&nbsp; Mason's good about this stuff.&nbsp; So yeah.&nbsp; That was pretty much all today.&nbsp; I don't know about going over to Jen's today though, but i definately know that i'm going to see if i can reschedual lessons for wed's or thur's after bandcamp.&nbsp; Cus wed's are my JenDays.&nbsp; Can't get in the middle of that right now, can we?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; So now, i'm planning on seeing her sunday... and that's not for a while.&nbsp; Crap guys, this sucks alot.&nbsp; I don't even want to talk about it anymore.&nbsp;  Now, about Mason today.&nbsp; His new name is M-Dog.&nbsp; For me at least.&nbsp; Anyway, today we played this piece called school days or something and he kept calling it schools' out.&nbsp; We were like, Sir, it's school days.&nbsp; He caught on a little later.&nbsp; But while we were playing the song he would start dancing and everything, cus it was this jazzy piece.&nbsp; So right before we start playing... he says ok, last time, baby.&nbsp; And we just started cracking up.&nbsp; It's so not like him to do anything like that but when he does it's halarious.&nbsp; And so then he requests his sword.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Yeah, his sword.&nbsp; His color-guard sword that is.&nbsp; It's huge, and he decides that in order for us to open up our throats then we need to pretend like we have a sword going down it.&nbsp; So of course, being in his quarky mood, he decides to attempt this stunt.&nbsp; Now, he's Mason, he's pretty old so... he tries to "fool" us by covering up his mouth and putting the sword down by the other side of his mouth so where we can't see it... but you can kinda sorta REALLY tell if you look hard enough... or if you're just looking at him you can tell he's not actually doing it.&nbsp; But the  way &nbsp;he was doing it.&nbsp; Just... so... cheesy!&nbsp; So yeah, we were all dying laughing at that too.&nbsp; He's funny when the freshmen don't know him yet and he wants them to think he's a funny guy... then he starts getting tough.&nbsp; But he's pretty cool and i respect him.&nbsp; Even though he can get kinda weird sometimes.&nbsp; I've got to go, i'm really hungry.&nbsp; More later.

      Ok, Jen just left my house like, 15 min's past when she was supposed to be home.&nbsp; Now i'm talking to her online.&nbsp; When she got home it was only her dad home with her brother, so no mom... so she's not in trouble at all.&nbsp; Man... what a freaking good time we always have when she comes over.&nbsp; It's like... a little taste of heaven right there in front of me.&nbsp; I'll tell you what, when we went to go pick her up, she always sits in the middle seat and i can NOT stop looking back there in the mirror just to see her hair blowing in the breeze with the window's down.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but i can't get over how beautiful she is.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but there is just no comparison to her beauty.&nbsp; I love her so much.&nbsp; Well, i'm outta energy now, she wore the hell outta me.&nbsp; I'll tell you more about it later... if i can find the strength.&nbsp; Good dreams tonight...  MAN !&nbsp; Alright, well i'll go now.&nbsp; Love you Jen.

      Ok ,well Jen's over right now and yes, she did get to come.&nbsp; Obviously.&nbsp; Yeah, so i've got to talk clean now.&nbsp; Like i always do, of course.&nbsp; Yep, so we haven't done anything yet since we had to make dinner.&nbsp; My parent's are weird like that, they make us make dinner since we're home all day and "have nothing better to do."&nbsp; If you're going to make an excuse for us to make dinner, at least make it reasonable.&nbsp; We don't even start to make it till after they get home.&nbsp; But hey, we're saving my mom the work and i know it means alot to her.&nbsp; So why not.  Tonight we had sloppy joes.&nbsp; Man, those are good.&nbsp; Everyone was complaining about&nbsp; how sweet they were and we told them that we didn't do anything to make them that way.&nbsp; But of course we did, we put 150% more brown sugar than it called for.&nbsp; It said to only put 2T but we put somewhere around 3.&nbsp; Rebel's, i know.&nbsp; So it wasn't that big of a deal, but still, i thought it was funny.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and we got these new chips, the Lay's Guacemole things.&nbsp; I don't know if that's actually how you spell it but that's what Jen says.&nbsp; And we all know she's ALWAYS right.&nbsp; I'm not kidding, there's nothing that you can try to prove to her and think you're right if she doesn't think the same.&nbsp; It starts messing with your head after a while cus she always wins.&nbsp; I think it's neat though, at least i can always turn to her if i need a sure answer.&nbsp; Like for instance, "Hey Jen,&nbsp; how does this pink boa look?"&nbsp; Then she'll tell me it looks great on me.&nbsp; So there ya have it, but now i've got to go... so bye.

      I admit it.&nbsp; I was watching one today.&nbsp; I can't remember what it was called exactly, but it was on channel 8 (abc) around 11 i think.&nbsp; Something like, All My Children.&nbsp; But i still can't believe i was watching one.&nbsp; They're so cheesey and emotional.&nbsp; God, what was i thinking!&nbsp; Whatever, i&nbsp;didn't like&nbsp;it just because im a guy... or at least i&nbsp;was a guy until earlier today.&nbsp; Not anymore, now i'm an 80 year old grandma.&nbsp; And the plot's are way to complex.&nbsp; It's like you get into one and then one of the other 9000 stories takes over and you lose track of the one you like and get sucked in to this new one about a guy cheating and getting away with it.&nbsp; It's terrible, teenager's shouldn't be allowed to watch that.&nbsp; That's how they get ideas.&nbsp; Now, if you're 80 then it's ok cus you're dying to cheat on your husband, but you&nbsp;don't even&nbsp;want to try to cus first of all, you're old and second, you're just waiting for your annoying spouse that eats beans all day and farts himself to sleep on the couch to die so you can get all his life insurance money and buy a  color  tv to watch your soaps on.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now you know where i'm comming from.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you're a guy, i encourage you to not watch any soaps.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;about a month ago, i was over at Jen's house and we were&nbsp;watching some&nbsp;afternoon soap on the WB.&nbsp; I can't even remember the name but i was pretty close to falling asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even ask her, i was laying down for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now i'm done, and all in all, don't watch soaps if you're my age.&nbsp; You can hold out for 70 years, can't you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So now it's tuesday and Jen's going to come over later today... or at least i hope so.&nbsp; She's had her aunt and uncle over for the weekend so we haven't been able to see eachother for more than a week now and the only time we've been able to talk on the phone was two nights ago.&nbsp; Not really cool for a couple of lovebirds who are completely way too into eachother like us.&nbsp; So yeah, her relatives are supposed to leave sometime this morning if i remember right.&nbsp; Lets see, i think it was her aunt, uncle, a 5 year old and a 2 1/2 year old.&nbsp; Or she might've said a 2 year old and a 1/2 year old.&nbsp; But i'm not sure.&nbsp; Anyway, she said that they were wearing her down so she didn't really have alot of energy to talk to me a couple nights ago.&nbsp; Which is alright, i understand how the can be, constantly chasing them down all the time.&nbsp; But they're alot of fun most of the time and i hope she enjoyed them while they were there.&nbsp; So yeah, now she's going to come over tonight.&nbsp; And that's like... a week of not seeing eachother... minimal communication every night... I think we're going to have quite a bit of fun.&nbsp; I can't wait and i know  she  can't wait!&nbsp; We're not going to have sex or anything, like most of you are thinking right now.&nbsp; Admit it.&nbsp; Ok, there you go.&nbsp; But my parents do.&nbsp; They're weird like that, but i understand sorta.&nbsp; If you had kids, and they were as in love as we were wouldn't you be a little worried too?&nbsp; Cus we like get to go IN my room and get away with shutting the door.&nbsp; Plus, my brother's room is adjacent to mine and he's already walked in on us making out and everything... so HE knows.&nbsp; But that actually turned out to be a good thing.&nbsp; Now he keeps watch and can loudly distract my parents before they come to barge in on us.&nbsp; So he's more of a guard post than anything.&nbsp; Score. My little brother's in this velocity camp for the rest of summer.&nbsp; I hear it's hell... but he's kinda out of shape.&nbsp; Well, i am too but i'm not getting  in  shape like he is.&nbsp; I would feel bad about not getting that way, but band camp starts tomorrow.&nbsp; Yeah, off come the pounds then.&nbsp; And that's more like endurance than anything.&nbsp; So i'm sure i'll lose like... oh 5 pounds by the time school starts, which is good, cus you gotta have physical endurance with a girl like Jen.&nbsp; And some mental too i guess... But she's gotta have more mental to be able to put up with me.&nbsp; Sometimes, i don't see how she does it.&nbsp; I mean,  I &nbsp;can't even put up with me sometimes!&nbsp; (compliment to Jen)&nbsp; But hey, when bandcamp rolls around my ability to see Jen any time i want to is going to be limited like crazy.&nbsp; The two-a-day scedual goes like this- 8-12:30 for the mornings and 6-8:30 at night.&nbsp; Now THAT takes up the rest of your life for the summer right there.&nbsp; Those days go for every single day of the week till school, except for the minor exception of no night practices on wed's cus of wed night church for all the godly coppellians.&nbsp; For me, that's a&nbsp;perfect opportunity right there for me to see Jen.&nbsp; On wed's and on the weekends.&nbsp; So i don't think it's going to be too bad really, it'll just take some getting used to.&nbsp; All in all, i think that we should be glad that we're getting to see eachother at all.&nbsp;

      Ok, so i'm in Texas right?&nbsp; And it like, never snows here.&nbsp; Well last year, it decides to snow on V-Day.&nbsp; GO FIGURE.&nbsp; So, me and Jen decided that'll be when we have our first kiss.&nbsp; Fair enough, but i don't know if i'm a good kisser yet or anything.&nbsp; I guess we'll soon find out, and if i'm not, then this thing ain't goin' nowhere.&nbsp; 6 months... i think i'm ok.&nbsp; But leading up to it was crazy.&nbsp; I was freaking out like crazy.&nbsp; So, like all guys that have never kissed before, i practiced in the mirror.&nbsp; I'll tell you what, that made me more scared cus it looked really faggy.&nbsp; My god, i can't even discribe what it looked like, but i'll try.&nbsp; It was like a 4 year old making a fish-face.&nbsp; That's about as close as i can get to telling you what it looked like.&nbsp; So yeah, imagin that for a few minutes............ Time up, onward with the story.&nbsp; So that morning, we've been going out for 11 days.&nbsp; Woot.&nbsp; So far, a new personal record.&nbsp;  I woke up and it was snowing.&nbsp; I knew that God wanted me to do this today.&nbsp; How awesome.&nbsp; So as i sat in bed, having blank fantasies about us&nbsp; kissing in the snow, i decided to get dressed and try to do something with her while the snow was still here.&nbsp; Not quite.&nbsp; As for me being in texas,&nbsp;it's usually warm... and so is the ground.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Now, that snow didn't last too long given the conditions, so there went the fantasy.&nbsp; I guess that's why it was blank.&nbsp; Anywho, I still talked to her that day.&nbsp; She still got to come over.&nbsp; We still watched a movie.&nbsp; I still held her.&nbsp; And it was good.&nbsp; So when she came over we had a nice dinner and then she came back to my room and we exchanged gifts.&nbsp; For me, she got a big teddy bear, a pink boa, some Milano Cookies and a poem by her.&nbsp; It was all good.&nbsp; I loved the boa, the pink was totaly me.&nbsp; So i gave her a big fat hug for that, then i gave her her present.&nbsp; It was 12 pink roses, and one big&nbsp;plastic one in the middle of them all with a note on it.&nbsp; I can't remember exactly what it said, but it was something along the lines of how i will love her until the petals of this rose fall off.&nbsp; I know girls, get it out, just say it with me.&nbsp; Awwwww.&nbsp; She really liked it alot and i think that made the kiss all the more special that night.&nbsp; We were getting ready to go and everything, and she was putting her shoes on and i was sitting there and we still hadn't kissed.&nbsp; By the way, we watched Hannible.&nbsp; Cool huh?&nbsp; Anyway, so she did the -come here- thing with her pointer finger and that's how we kissed for the first time.&nbsp; It was really awesome, then we did one more after that... then one more at her door.&nbsp; It was my most memorable day by far.&nbsp; And if she gets mad at me posting this, i'm sorry Jen, but i just want everyone to know how much i love you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, so that was&nbsp;Valentine's day there for ya.&nbsp; I'll add some more stuff here later, i love you Jen.

      Hey, so everything lately has been kinda cool i guess.&nbsp; Nothing too great going on really.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, i do have a girlfriend, Jennifer, and she's one of the best things that has ever happened to me i'm sure.&nbsp; It's pretty cool how we met... or at least i say that so you'll keep reading.&nbsp; It was like... 6 and a half months ago i think and i have this friend, Courtney.&nbsp; She's a pretty cool cat and i have her to thank for the hookup.&nbsp; Well, she didn't really hook us up, she actually tried to back out of it now that i think about it.&nbsp; One day after class, Jen and Courtney were waiting for me outside of class, like they always did.&nbsp; My loyal pets i used to think of them as.&nbsp; Not anymore... well not Jen at least.&nbsp;&nbsp;But like i was saying, one day after class they were waiting and Courtney said something and i said something back that made her mad, but it was that cheesy joking mad thing, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well anyway,&nbsp;she goes through with it and scampers off ahead and i yell after her "Fine!&nbsp; I don't need you!&nbsp; I've got this girl here!"&nbsp; (Jen, but i didn't know her name at the time)&nbsp; So i'm walking there with this stranger that i've never properly been introduced to before with my arm around her&nbsp;to show Courtney that i didn't need her and to play along with her crappy joke.&nbsp; So i'm walking there, and i don't even know this girls name, so i take my arm off from around her neck and ask her, and i tell her that i'm travis.&nbsp; So that was that.&nbsp; Later in the week i guess Jen decides to start liking  me  after a breakup with another guy.&nbsp; And so now the notes start... and lots of them.&nbsp; Which isn't a bad thing... i just wasn't used to them.&nbsp; So like the first note, i'm freaking out cus i'm afraid what it'll say.&nbsp; Why? I'm still not sure to this day.&nbsp; But the main thing was that we were on the road to the begginnig of communication.&nbsp; It's kind of like evolving.&nbsp; But not.&nbsp; Do you see now?&nbsp; I thought so, well anyway i would write notes back and everything.&nbsp; Yeah, so we did that for a week or so.&nbsp; Then i went to the movies with her, her friend and Courtney.&nbsp; We went to see Along Came Polly.&nbsp; Good movie to see with someone you barely know that likes you and this guy who's a total paranoied fu*k-up ends up getting the girl.&nbsp; That brightend my future opportunities.&nbsp; She said that she liked me to start off with cus i was cute.&nbsp; Good call.&nbsp; So after the movie her mom drove&nbsp;us all home, singing and waving her arms&nbsp;while Jen was in the front seat burping on and off like a guy.&nbsp; Total turn on.&nbsp; So i was sitting back there like any scared boy would if they saw this.&nbsp; After that night, i knew that i liked this girl.&nbsp; There was no doubt, the fact that she thought i was cute and was willing to give me a chance was enough for me to at least check into a little more.&nbsp; After i got home, my dad was laying on the couch watching American Choppers when i woke him up by walking in and closing the door.&nbsp; I sat down and he was like how was the movie, and i was like, it was great, but not as great as this girl.&nbsp; And he was like, oh?&nbsp; And i was like, oh.&nbsp; (don't ask)&nbsp; So then i told him that i was thinking about asking this girl out, and he was like, ok, go for it.&nbsp; So i was like alright, glad you're ok with it, cus she's totaly hot and burps all the time.&nbsp; And for me, if a girl can burp in front of you on your first semi-date, she's gotta be pretty cool.&nbsp; It means that she's completely cool being around you.&nbsp; I just wish it worked for the guys.&nbsp; That's like our failed mating call.&nbsp; But hey, i'm getting off track again.&nbsp; Now after that deal with my dad, i stayed up the rest of the night, thinking of just how to.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; So later the next day i get her email.&nbsp; Score.&nbsp; She doesn't have AIM, which is cool, cus it's a total bore if you have it.&nbsp; Ok, so we start this game called 20 Questions.&nbsp; If you're not familiar with it, the game goes off and on, asking personal questions about eachother.&nbsp; We played through one game and decided it was pretty cool.&nbsp; Then she had to go to bed, so i told her goodnight and hoped we could do that again some time.&nbsp; I got a "me too" from her.&nbsp; The next day at school, more notes... Neato man.&nbsp; Fastforward....... Later that night.&nbsp; Ok, so back to 20 Q's.&nbsp; Now right now, it's tuesday, and i'm going to go insane if i don't ask her out soon.&nbsp; I had meant to do it the preceding friday but failed to because of lack of balls.&nbsp; That tuesday, my balls were bulging and i was ready for anything... well maybe they wern't, but i was ready for anything.&nbsp; So we're playing the game then, on the tuesday night, and we get up to question 19, and it's her turn, and she asks are you going to ask me out?&nbsp; My witty response to this was, "I don't like it when people bug me about that, but i don't know yet, just don't get all over me about it please, it gets annoying after a while"&nbsp; and i intentionaly forgot to ask a question.&nbsp; She catches that and tells me, along with an appology.&nbsp; I forgive her and tell her that i'm tired and i'll think of one later the next day at school.&nbsp; She pleads for me to just finish the game there&nbsp; but i tell her, no i'm really tired and i can't think of one off the top of my head.&nbsp; She says ok, and tells me goodnight.&nbsp; I tell her goodnight, and sweet-dreams, cus they'll come true.&nbsp; I guess she didn't get it till the next morning cus i didn't get the response that night.&nbsp; And now, i'm obligated to pull through with the plan, to make my 20th question, "will you go out with me"&nbsp; Genious, i know.&nbsp; Wed. Feb. 3, 2004- The day of judgement, if i'm willing to make myself the happiest man alive, or to totaly screw myself over and blow it for the both of us.&nbsp; I'd had a bad reputation for blowing things like this, and i wanted to erase it.&nbsp; Start over, Get a life.&nbsp; That day after school, i asked her if she wanted to know what my 20th question was and she was like oh yeah!&nbsp; I was walking her to her car like i always did, and she had her friend there with her.&nbsp; I didn't care who was there, even if it were her ex.&nbsp; All i needed was me and my bulging balls.&nbsp; Just kidding... So there, as i pulled her off to the side away from the crowd, it was me, her and her friend.&nbsp; Then it came out.&nbsp; "Ok, well my 20th question is, do you want to go out with me?"&nbsp; And then, a response that i don't think i'll ever get from any other girl, that proved that she was mine and all mine, "SURE!&nbsp; So do you mean like this saturday at your house?"&nbsp; (i had planned earlier that she was going to come over and we were going to watch a movie)&nbsp; Me:"Sure... i guess"&nbsp; I mean, what's a guy to say then?&nbsp; "Um, no, i meant like longer than that"&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; I just kind of played along like it was alright and totaly normal for someone to say that.&nbsp; So then she was like yeah, i'd love to.&nbsp; So i won't tell what went on that saturday, but the pants did stay on.&nbsp; Shirts..... I'm not so sure about that.&nbsp; I'm kidding, we don't even do that still.&nbsp; And it's almost been like, what, 6 months on Aug. 3?&nbsp; Yeah, i guess.&nbsp; So i'm still trying to think of something to do for her then.&nbsp; I'm not sure i'll get a chance to but i'd really like to, since we have bandcamp.&nbsp; I don't know, we'll see when the time comes though.&nbsp; All i know for now is that i'm completely in love with this girl and i wouldn't trade a thing for her.

      Today was my last saturday that i had before school starts up again. It was alright, i have to admit. Lets see... Thursday i got my wires replaced in my braces. That really sucked and it still hurts. And lets see, yesterday i had my welcome back concert up at the highschool. That was a BLAST. Right. Jen went to that out of total dedication to me i guess. Woot. She said it was alot of fun and she enjoyed it. Get this, she had to sit/ suffer through it with my  parents . That's like 2 hours of my parent's to suffer though. I don't know how she made it, but i hope they didn't get that boring. When we were marching onto the feild i did a spin when we turned on there and i have no idea how far it went back in the line but it was cool when i did it i guess. I dunno. Well, the show went on pretty well from what i saw. When we played our stand-tunes it was alot of fun. Brandt Scharrs broke his horn in half and played the mouthpiece ontop of the bottom joint. So it sounded like a party horn pretty much. Yeah, he tried to play a stand tune like that and i could NOT stop laughing. He's so funny, our little game of slapball that we play is awesome. Anyway, that was friday, yesterday. Today Jen and i went shopping at grapevine mills and we shopped for 3 hours. Crazy, i know. But it was alot of fun and i'm glad that i got to spend that much time with her, and even after that we went to the calvery's house for my mom's birthday and everything. Then her brother showed up with his son, Jake, and i saw him and said 'sup dizzle' and he started crying soo much. So every time i saw him i said that and sure enough he'd cry. I wasn't trying to be mean, but it was for no reason... he just crys. Kids, i don't know, they're just as about confusing as women. Except women don't crap their pants. Yes, i'll stop there.  But it's just been an awesome last few days of freedom till school. Tomorrow i'm going to go mow dave's yard with ryan and see how fast we can knock that out. I'm sure it'll be really quick, maybe 45 at the most. We'll see. I don't know, i'm tired though. Nightio kiddo's. I love you Jen, i'm glad that we got to spend this much time together before school and hope we can spend some more tomorrow some time.

      I feel SO bad.  Once again, i've blown off my girlfriend.  I can't deal with it much longer, and i feel like i'm going to explode if i don't let it out somewhere.  I feel TERRIBLE.  A total effing  jackass  is more like it actually.  I'm really sorry i made you worry so much Jen, but i just kinda went to go play basketball.  I know i should've called, and i know that i probably could've found a way to call, but i didn't and i feel a huge wave of anguish rip through me.  It's just tearing me apart inside and i'm so sorry about it.  All i know is that i want to have a good time this saturday.  I just hope you can forgive me, cus i'll never do that again.  And everyone else who's reading this other than Jen, i obviously cannot seem to forgive myself for this mishap and don't make fun of me.  But tomorrow is my mom's birthday.  Friday.  Friday the 13th to be exact.  Yep.  Wonderful day for a birthday, don't you agree?  If we're  lucky,  we won't get any rain.  But yeah, my mom said that she wants Jennifer to go to her party the next day (Sat, incase you can't count) at my dad's friends house.  I really hope she can go, we're going to have alot of fun if she can.  I'm  not sure what we're going to do there, probably alot of nothing... but we'll figure something out... *WINK WINK*  Nah, we'll probably just watch tv cuddled on the couch together most of the time.  They totaly don't mind at all.  That's what's cool about my parents and their friends.  They don't care about anything, they're so layed back.  I know people's parent's who are so uptight about everything, but not mine.  Not their friends either.  It's awesome.  I'm lucky.  But back to be being an asshole.  I feel really bad and i think that if i can just sleep on it it'll be better.   If  i can fall asleep... i just got my braces tightend this morning.  7 FREAKING 30.  Ok, now your turn to commiserate for me.  ---------- Ok, time's up.  But yeah, it hurts like a mo.  And speaking of mo's, i saw American Wedding a few days ago.  Funny movie, whatever Ebert and whoever the other guy was gave it, it wasn't enough.  It deserves an acadamy award.  Am i right?  Can i get an AMEN?  Can you tell i'm freaking TIRED?  Good, i'm glad you could, since you have esp (or espn for the girls)  and everything.  Welp, that's about it for now, since i need to get up early tomorrow.  WOOT, BANDCAMP!  Yay... i only look forward to it for the SlapBall.  Good game!  Ask me about it if you're not in on it yet.  Ok, well later foo's.  Word.

      It's been a while since i've typed anything in here. Sorry to keep you waiting for so long. There's just really been nothing going on that much lately, just the same ole same ole. Band camp... blah blah. So anyways, nothing great really. I've been getting to spend time with my favorite person on earth a little more than usual. She's really good to me and i'm glad to have her around alot. She came over last night and we had to keep the door open, WIDE open, or else she had to go home right then. That meant we couldn't do any heavy-duty making out or anything... just out of fear of getting caught. Oh well, we were lucky to get to keep our door closed while we could. I'm greatful. I guess they can't trust us anymore now that they're finding out that -WE'VE KISSED AFTER GOING OUT FOR 6 MONTHS!- What a crime. So, now to try to make us cut down on it, we're going to have to keep the door open. Speaking of my parent's, get this. They're not going to my welcome back concert with the band thing this friday because of my mom's birthday party that they can't put back one day to help me out a little.  Jen's going, that's good.  At least i know that i have one person in the stands that i can work hard for.  But i just really wish my parent's were going.  I don't think they know how much this means to me that they come to it. It doesn't seem like that big a deal, and really it's not.  It's just that i put so much damn effort onto it and you know, i'd like for them to be there and at least  attempt  to support me a little.  And when i say this stuff, i'm mostly talking about my mom cus she's the one always too tired to go and when i come home she's sitting there watching a movie or something on the couch or on the back patio or whatever. It's like, could you not spare the hour out of your life to come and watch me doing something i love? Is it that hard? It's the little things that mean alot to people. The little things. My dad's really good about it, but sometimes he gets carried away with other things, and i can let it go most of the time, but my mom's really bad about it. I love her with all my heart, but she just won't listen to other people when it comes to considerations. If she's got her mind set on something then she's going to go all out with it. No doubt. No stopping her. I'll have to live with it and just lean on my dad i guess, but i really wish she'd get her act together. Maybe they can hold off the thing on friday and move it to saturday, when i don't have my band concert. Just a consideration... oh wait, never mind mom. I'm tired, goodnight all. I love you Jennifer.

      Alright, well there's nothing really special about today except for that my mom was calling me names and getting extremly way too pissed off at me, and i got to go and swim at Jen's in the dark.  You can probably tell the good from the bad.  I'll start off with the bad, my mom.  Like most of you know, she just was in a crash.  She lived... but  now she's really pissy about everything.  It's weird how it all works out, i mean she should be glad she didn't die or anything, right?  I know i am, but i wish the new attitude didn't come with it.  She's been calling me a bunch of names like idiot, moron, her favorite- prick, and lots of others.  I'm not really able to cope with it all too well, since every time i try and help her do something i get a "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO"  I don't get her sometims.  The second part of my day was better though It was getting to go over to Jen's.  Awesomeness.  We got to swim in the dark and everything.  The mood was PERFECT... except her little brother was there... and her parents were home.  Otherwise, it could've been awesome.  BUT, it's ok, at least i know how cool it is to have a pool and to be able to sit out there in 85' weather and just sit there in the pool leaning up against the side with your head leaning back looking up at the full sky of stars, and feel totaly complacent.  What a feeling.  So beautiful, and the fact that Jennifer was there made it all the more.  I know i'll be having sweet dreams tonight, maybe about what  could've  happened... or maybe i'll just have dreams that contain me and Jen.  Wish i knew.  There's only one way to find out though, goodnight.  I love you Jen.

      Today started off a little easier than yesterday. Maybe because today was the 6th month mark for me and Jen. Go us. I'm so happy, she means so much to me. I'm really glad that we've made it this far and hope we can go even longer... WAY longer. I hope we're together for a very long time, cus she really knows how to make me happy. So, yeah, that's why my day has been good. That's enough reason alone for it to be awesome and unlike any other day. Band camp though... that's like suicide there. I was unaffected by it today though because of the occasion. So i'm still alive. We're learning our drill for the opener. And if you're not in band, stop asking me if the drill is the same as last year, cus it's not. It's different every year. I swear, like 5 people have asked me, so don't feel weird and stupid because you are one of the group that have. But i mean, of course we're going to learn a new drill. What's the fun of learning the same thing every year? That's right, there is none. That's right, that was retorical. I'm listening to the Everclear CD - So much for the afterglow. Neat cd. Father of mine is a very deep song. Check out they lyrics, you've kinda got to feel sorry for the guy, it's pretty sad. They talk about "the machine" alot. I'm not sure what they're talking about but i think it's showbusiness. If you know tell me. Dude, Chinise for dinner tonight! AWESOME. Just the thing to come home to after a day of band! Good stuff, i'm never really too sure what i get every time, but it's always good no matter what it really is. Because the food is so good, Chinise people are off of my axis of evil. But McDonald's is still on there. Along with Clinton. And the "d" word, aka- man's worst enemy. Yes, known also as 'vibraters' to some. Changing subject, last word first, those aren't cool and if you're a girl, shame on you if you own one. Burn it and get a boyfriend. New subject. Ah yes, my sleepiness. Right. I'm tired. There you have it. I'll write more later, but now... TO THE SACK! And no, not in the sexual context either this time. More later. I love you Jen, happy 6 months, hope we can stay together for a very long time. As long as we just keep loving eachother like we have been, everything will be alright. You've got my heart, i love you.

      Yep, it's true, i am.  Sorry, i forgot to post anything yesterday... cus i didn't really feel like it. I was BEAT! Tired as hell guys, i'm not joking. Ok, saturday night i was talking to Jen on the phone and then half way through our conversation ryan came over and was going to pick up the lawn mower since his was broken down and all, so i had to hang up with her. I told her i'd call her back in a few minutes, but i went outside to go put the thing in their mini-van. Turns out i ended up looking like a total jack-ass and sorta blew her off later. Though i did call her back, it wasn't for that long and i felt so bad about that and thought i was the worst person in the world. When me and ryan were outside loading it up, they invited me to spend the night so we could mow in the morning. I said yes, and went back inside to pack for the night while on the phone with Jen. When i told her the news she was really disappointed and that just made me feel worse about my decision. So there i was, guilt-struck, about to score major boo-boo points with my girlfriend to go spend the night with my best friend. And just for the record, i only spent the night down there for business, in order to go mow the next morning. Ok, well Jen finally starts to get ok with the fact that i haven't seen this guy for like 2 weeks or something and gives me permission. Then as i'm wrapping up the conversation with her ryan starts to yell loud enough that i am his mexican so she can hear. Why? I'm still wondering myself. Well as i finally tell her goodbye, ryan goes off into the kitchen and tells his mom why we took so long. I'm not going to post it here, cus it's really stupid and nobody deserves to know. So we get to his house and he's loading the catalyst and spiderman2 cd onto his media player, while we eat nachos. And yes, they were mine, so don't even try the "not chos" joke you freaking morons. Sorry if i offend. Idiots. Speaking of idiots actually, there's like, 1/6 of one of those huge containers of sunny D left and we're bored, looking for amusing stuff... so i try to chug it. I get all but the very very last of it and if i even looked at the nachos or had one more drop of the OJ, then i would've spewed. For real. After that we went and watched his dad kick some butt on Halo, then watched SNL. Wasnt' that great, i almost fell asleep durring it, but didn't. Probably cus pink was singing on it. FREAKING YAWN..... Then we went into his room and talked about crap till forever. This part of the story is classified. Sorry. With out well rested bodies the next morning, we were ready to mow a yard. That's right, 9 am, go and mow. But before, for maximum energy, we needed our super hero breakfast. French toast and a granola bar. Yes, that's right, a granola bar. We could've not eaten for 2 days and still had enough energy to mow the yard. We split the yard half and half, he edged and i mowed. Simple. We were done in less than 45 min's. Skill, yes, we posess that. But before we left for my house he had asked me if i wanted to go to hurricane harbor with him and his family, and i turned him down, since i had blown off my girlfriend last night. He understood. So here's the next 6 hours or so... call Jen... SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING... Jen comes over. isn't that awesome? I could've been with ryan at hurricane harbor and still be home in time to spend time with Jen! It's ok, i cought up on some info about the 70's. VH1 rules. But when she finally came over we had fun. This part of the post is too, classified. Then she left around 10 or so, and me and my dad didn't talk in the car. It was weird cus we normally do, so i could tell he was mad about something. When we got home i was walking twards the back and my dad said wait a second, and my mom said why did you have your door shut? And i was like i don't know... and then my dad was like yeah, what were yall doing? What is there to hide? I was silent. How many times have i told you to keep your door open? How many times has your mom told you? And i told them that they've told me alot. So they said that if i have my door shut again, i have to spend the rest of the time out there with them from then on. Not cool. I mean, we're lucky that we even get to go back into my room... AND shut the door some times. We're still lucky we get to go back there, but kyle's room is right next to ours so i mean, we can't really do anything anymore. He knows and all, but i don't want him watching and stuff. Cus that's just weird... you know? Of course you do. But i'm going to see if i can convince my mom to let us still go back there, cus we DO kiss, and after 6 month's that'd be weird if we didn't. If you take that away from us then that's not really good, cus that's kinda how we stay connected and really show eachother how much we love one another. Mushy stuff, i know, but it's the truth. So yeah, that was yesterday. TODAY- Today i woke up against my own will at 7. SO not cool. It's true about monday mornings, they suck. Period. And they suck more if you wake up and you have your period that day too... but i'm a guy and don't do that stuff. Thank GOD. Being a guy is so easy. Enough said. Ok, then i go to bandcamp and everything and it's HOT and HUMID. Not a good morning mix. More than 5 kids blacked out cus of the heat. (4 were flutes... what a suprise...) But it wasn't that great of a day. I still have to go back up there to learn the opener of the show later tonight, but that's not till 6. Poor leadership, they're out there right now laying dots. That sucks, what grueling work. Yeah, so that's today so far. I might get back on this and tell you what happened there durring the rehersal. Maybe not. I'm sure i'll be even tired..er than i already am right now so i'll probably hit this sack and go to bed. And when i say hit the sack, i don't mean masturbate. Well actually... nah, not tonight. Not in the mood. Anywho- I'm gonna go now. 444- i wish that wed i can come over to Jen's and swim with her in the dark..... woo hoo!
