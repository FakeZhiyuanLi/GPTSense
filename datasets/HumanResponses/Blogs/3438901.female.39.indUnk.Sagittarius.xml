      Hello....My name is Kat.........AKA Kathy and nicknamed Katfish by my sister in law and brother in law. Born in the Elkhart, Indiana, 12-18-1964. I was raised in a small town, Bristol, Indiana. My husband and I recently moved to Bristol about 4 months ago, after living in Elkhart for the last 5 years. We have two 'kids' named Jack and Mabel. Jack is our 3 year old green iguana and Mabel is our 5 year old chuckwalla (southwestern desert lizard). Both of our 'kids' are very spoiled! They have their own custom rooms which I built when we purchased our home last fall.  The home we purchased was in quite a state of need. It was reposessed by the bank because the previous owner could no longer afford it and quite obviously, couldn't take care of it. It took us three months of labor to get the house in 'move-in' shape. We replaced floors, doors, light fixtures, faucets, outlets and switches....in other words, we did a major overhaul. We are still not done with the home yet. It will need a new roof, likely next year. We have numerous little things we want to do as well. The big project lately has been reclaiming the existing landscape and cleaning up the stagnant frog pond otherwise known as an inground swimming pool. The pool guys will be coming to replace the liner in a week or so, that is if it ever stops raining here!!! However, in the meantime, I have amazingly cleaned it up enough to swim in. I never knew brackish,leaf filled, smelly water could become so clean! It has taken a major effort on my part. I work part time so I have more available time to get this house and yard back in nice shape. So far so good but sooooooo much work! It has been rewarding though. Yesterday, I finally got the rest of the front flower bed cleaned out, fresh mulch down and lots of pretty flowers planted(white zinnias,peach, purple and white verbena, blue salvia, coleus and white alyssum). I also set work...dread...on the back yard's overgrown and weedy landscapes. This yard was/is such a mess! It had been let go for at least 2 years or better. I weeded a third of the large bed on the upper terrace of the yard. I planted my tomatoes there. The rest will be annuals and perennials. I am not planting my usual big veggie garden this year. I will hopefully do that next year.

      Finally got our swimming pool liner that we ordered in April...Installed is another thing. The guys came out on Wednesday last week and ripped out the old liner but not before their water pump died with about 5000 gallons of water left to go and impending rain in the forecast. They got the pump running, the sky was gray but the clouds passed over. Whew.... This is the whole reason it has taken this long to start with! We have had non stop rain since the  first couple weeks of May so that has delayed the install. I feel sorry for the pool guys because here it is June and they are like 6 weeks behind schedule all because of a fickle Mother Nature. So anyways...They ripped out the rest of the liner and started re troweling the sand bottom in the shallow end when the sound of thunder pierced the air...The sky started to darken, lightning started to crackle then the rain came. DOH!!! They stayed for a few minutes, still troweling, the sand had to be damp anyway, then a big bolt of lightning set a fire under their butts and they bailed out of the pool and into the garage. 10 minutes passed and so did the rain. Back in the pool to finish the troweling. About 30 minutes later, rain again, out they go for another 10 minutes. This happened about 2 more times before they were ready to put the liner in. Mind you it is now about 3:00PM and they had been there since 7:30AM. Now they place the liner in position and stretch it to four corners and start setting it in the bead track at the deep end. Something ain't right and they have too much slack on one side and the liner needs to stretch about 2 foot on the other to get the last corner in. Out comes their boss to check progress and he tells them they have to pull the liner in the opposite direction, all the way from one side over to the other. So they pull it out of track way back by the stair opening and tug it clear over to the corner opposite the other side of the stair opening. Now they have it in. After all that rain, the concrete swim deck is too wet to hold the duct tape required to seal the pool so the blower fan can get a good suction to remove the wrinkles and air between the liner and the walls. They bring out a heat gun to dry the concrete so the tape will stick. They get the tape to stick and the blower is working so they pack up to leave. Now we are pool idiots. This is our first swimming pool. It came with the house we bought and it was in bad shape. So they leave. I am like dumb founded. When are they going to finish our pool. How long does this fan run. Is it okay to leave it run in the rain... I call the shop. Oh yea, "just leave it run until you get a foot of water in the shallow end". Okay. So I go out and inspect the recently installed, way cool looking liner. I see a bump in the shallow end right in front of the steps. Looks like a rock under there. Hubby calls the pool guys they next morning. It has been raining all night, all morning and rain is in the forecast through the coming weekend. They come out Thursday morning, the day after the install. Yup, its a rock. "That's gotta come out. Turn your water off. We will try to come out tomorrow, but it may be early next week." So the blower stays on.They come out Friday and remove the rock, reseal the tape and turn the blower and the water back on. Saturday morning arrives. Now the liner has pulled away from the bead track near a corner in the deep end.Pool guy comes back out with another dude. They inspect it, tell us not to worry and say they will be out to finish the pool on Monday and to get the water level up to one foot in the deep end. We do this and two more small areas of separation occur. They say they pop them back in without problem by using a heat gun to stretch the liner. Well,it,s Sunday now and as I look out on the pretty blue hole in the backyard, I will continue to keep my fingers crossed, hoping that when I come home from work, it will be done and the water will be on.
