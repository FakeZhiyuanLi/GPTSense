      Salvaging the energy i've got.I realized that i'm becoming a ehbasan.The places i've been.The people i meet.The bastards they whacked.The security.I have self discovered myself.The people i need.And those i don't.The ones that will help me.And those that will go.The new.And the old.Tapered or cool.Fighters or not.Sluts or bitches.I lost my hp.All my contacts are gone.Fuck.But its bothering me that much.Its sucking up my energy.Life is too fast of a pace for me to catch up.Will it slow down and wait for me? I now know the people i need in life.Those who are shittin behind my back.I now have no fear.No hesitation.Nothing to lose.Everything to gain.School?Wad is it to me?Cigs?I want them.Sex?Im giving her supersized.Drinks?Oh god i hope im not an alcoholic.Drugs?I don't do them.Music?Many of them are shit.I am so high.Life's taking its toll on me.Im waiting for the time to snap.I'll take u on.Even if u're van damme.These past weeks.I've learned alot of new things.Met alot of new people.People who once i tot wouldn't ever be my friends.The people that i once looked down upon.They were in fact in many ways superior to me.It seems like i've been wiped off from the faced of this world.Returned.Wiser smarter and stronger.Discpline once i tot was not for me.Now im living in it.To the way i wanna go.No one can stop me.Im not ready for tommorow.And i cant control thinking about yesterday.Where do i wanna be?Who do i wanna be with?In fact i dont really know.Dont u go away.Every  mistake.Seems so big now.As the days were longing.I think about the things caught in my mind.Damn my education.The chicks i got to meet.I don want to be there when u hit the ground.You cant make things right.Neither could i.I've learned to appreciate every minute of my life.These past 2 weeks were really meningful to me.Get on the roller coaster.I've been better known to beat the brain.Today is just a daydream.I've seen people whoreally have repented in life.Singing rapsodies.The people who real fighters whoave nothing to lose.Im starting to evolve into them.Throwing it all away.The gals who are daring sick and psycotic.The people who have to spend years in research for their souls.Holding on.For dear life.Apart from all these.They are the people who you can really trust.Cos when all of the stars have faded away.They are the people who'll bring them back some day.The fire in my heart is out.I've never really had a doubt.If you had the chance to save me would do it?Knowing i could never save u in return.if u did. All i've to say is "thankyou"

      WO! Saturday was exhausting.. Went to town.. Wif Cicak, Yasin and the gang... After doing crap and disturbing gals.. Headed down to hendrix... OMG! It was really happening there... But shit.. Before that we got screened by some stupid cops.. who'd i'd thrash in a 1 on 1 match.. their so gayish and skinny... the singapore police force must be crazy..CB! One of them ask us "we all where one?" haha.. wad a joke... Yasin said "bue tuey!" I was afraid he might bring us for urine  urlLink test .. Yea.. So they checked our id.. I gave Yan's id and wrote down abdullah's address... I had my ic already in my shoe.. Oh manz..! So after that screening shit.. Headed down to Hendrix. Reach there arnd 11pm. The "dok guy" told us that just finished a  urlLink raid .. Fuck it.. Who cares..Went in in pairs.. Each pair 1 jug.. So we had 3 jugs.. Drank outside the club.. And started a snorting game.. (sucking the vodka and acohol) into your nostrils.. It was cool... The other guys are dicks.. Some are already drunk and high .... It made my dick laughed. You know i'm very sensitive if  urlLink people  act drunk or are not strong in drinking... They shouldn't be hanging out wif me.. Oh yea! Met zaki and the other gang.. Mamat and the other zaki..They were also going to hendrix.. Went in together with them..  Headed down to the dancefloor... Zaki and his gang was taking out their trance moves out of their pockets.. Met the national U-17 guys.. Shabbay and Rasul on the dancefloor... So one big group of us.. Formed a circle of 7 and dance together.. Not long lAter.. Another group of chicks, came in the middle of our circle and dance with us.. HAHA... I can see that Rasul was damn happy.. In fact all of us were... Danced with one of the girls in the circle.. She's hot.. Gotta this mix british and malay blood.. And she's 17,cool and hot..YEA... I don mind older gals.. The boys were like "wah... take 1 alone ar.. selfish sia" I gave them the surprised look..Her name was Diana.. And she's schooling in Tamasek Poly.. I told her i was 18.. And a slut wif unintellectual mind.. Oh boy , she belived me. All of us were just into the groove. Then , went out to 7-eleven awhile, cos Diana wanted to buy her lollipop.. And i was thristy and wanted my Gulp.So 2 of us went there.. and she insisted on paying for me.. I said it was ok i got cash.. But she said persistently.. So yea.. "have it ur own way bitch.!" Then she suggested to sit at this deserted alley behind hendrix cos i could not bring my gulp into the club.. yea.. the rest was history.. Alot of crazy and hottie things happened.. I wouldn't want to elaborate... After we finished , went back to hendrix.. It was already 2.30am.She was acting cute wif her lollipop.. By then there were like 6 chicks in the circle.. Haha.. Me n cicak entered the middle. Dragged Diana too.. OMg! We were sandwiched... Like i was surrounded by 6 gals.. all around me.. Fuck.. The other fact was that... When gals are dancing and sweating.. They stink... Unbearable..Shabbay then join us..He was a crappy bastard.. Keep asking me for cigs.. Dragged this other malay gal wif me out and danced wif her for a while.. She was quite chio also..She had blonde  urlLink hair .. Then suddenly arnd 3.15 am , the stopped the  urlLink music .. and cid and ssb came in.. They just scanned the dancefloor.. Perhaps they were searching for someone in particular.. Then in like 2 mins.. they left... and the song started back..Danced with the boys till closing.. They were all crazy.. And Mamat. Gosh! He's such a pervert.. Closing  urlLink time .. 4 am.. The guys asked me to ton... Nah..I was too tired.. Met Alip outside Hendrix.. he just came back from town.. Chatted wif him .. Then we took NR3  urlLink home  together..They was 3 chicks with him.. One of them was his gf.. BED! I LOVE MY BED!

      Honey you are a rock. Upon which I stand. And I come here to talk. I hope you understand. The green eyes. You're the spotlight. Shines upon you. And how could? Anybody deny you. I came here with a loan. And it feels so much lighter, Now that I met you. Honey you should know. That I could never go on without you. Green eyes. Honey you are the sea. Upon which I float. And I came here to talk. I think you should know. The green eyes. You're the one that I wanted to find. And anyone who tried to deny you,  Must be out of their mind. Love those green eyes.

      Hey! I heard you ran away. But where're you gonna run. You got such a pretty face.  And the world's a small small place. Cos when you're running on your own. You know u whane like rolling stone. Cos the stone will find it's place. And when you hear the space. Just crawl and never run. And when your work is done. And then you see the sun. So sing what you want. I'm a man on a mission. No time to love. No time to be wasting. I want know if you feel the boredom. All the things you do that make you feel undone. Feel undone. Blues!  I heard you caught the blues. What was the sin? Have you got out of bed? Have you get out of there? You know a head space that you don't. And will you cannot and you don't. A fortune has been made. On all the illness they made. And then we've gotta pay. For the drugs to take it away. And then you're gonna find.  There's nothing with your mind. That you don't already know. That you ain't already seen.  Do you live in a dream? Save your song. Don't you cause trouble. Man on a mission.  Is a man in a bubble. Play your cards before your dice.  You'll get a piece of lemon.  And the piece of that vibe.  There's no time to be wasting.  By then... you'll wake up. And smile. Cos you know you're mine.

      I just ended my training. It was so tiring.. We did gym workouts. My thigh muscles are like contracting and aching now. Just reached home. I am like dying of exhaustion now.. Went home wif zul,erwan and hairul just now.. Met Nadira at cck station. She was going home from her friend's house. I was like sweating and so tired.. I haven't seen her for ages.. Yea i tink i miss her.. She's one good friend..She was so spunky , full of energy and very vibrant. She gave me a huge huge hug. Till i could feel her tits pressing against my chest. OMG! I wasn't smelling pretty good after my training though. Haha.. We chatted for awhile before i headed home. I said to her you're looking even prettier now.. And she replied.. Oh ya.. Of course.. As usual.. HAHA.. wad the hell...Ego babe. Aniwae we had a good laugh and its nice to see her after such a long time.. I realised i've been neglecting my friends now.. Im too busy with training , exams and my personal stuff.. It was sad. I got to know that my friend is in the Intensive Care Unit. He got attacked by 7 ppl wearing masks and each armed with a parang. He was caught off guard. Im not suppose to disclose any names now.. Aniwae my fren was like sitting in a group of friends at west coast when suddenly 7 guys with masks and parangs started attacking them. 2 of them got to run.. However he and his other friend was attacked brutally.His fren got a deep cut on the head. This friend of mine , he lost 3 fingers. Got a punctured stomach. I hope he survives.. I just saw him like last month and he was ok and cool. I just hope he'll do well.. This is shit. Didn't know the attackers from where.Oh boy.. I have nothing more to say.I'll pray for him.

      Cant wake up 2dae.. super duperly tired. yesterday i slept arnd 1.30. talk to abdullah on the phone.. we haf so many things to talk about.We both we like super engrossed in the conversation.Aniwae today was my chemistry and literature paper.. went to school wif azhar today.He told me about the Singapore vs Selangor match yesterday.He went to the national stadium.Actually i was supposed to go wif my SAF team but i was too tired..Jus woke up from my sleep.The previous day i went clubbing.Very tired.Coach Richard is going to start his nagging wif me.So i was azhar in the train.As the train arrived there was these 2 girls like smiling at us and like talking to each other and smiling at the same time.WTF!? Early morning do this kind of thing.. SMLJ.Knn the other fact that those 2 girls also "cannot make it" la.Cb. It was so irritating..We were standing infront of them and like one of them was like listening to the discman and it was so loud. Even i could hear the techno.Techno? Get a life gal. She was like nodding her head to the beat.Trying to get our attention or something and then smiling to her friend.Cannot tahan already i can azhar moved to the other carriage. Wad nonsense right? So i had my lit and chemistry paper. The lit essay sucked the crap out of me. I wroted cock,dick and wadeva else u call it.I had to write like 2 full pages of essay without leaving line or else Mrs Chng would scream in my ear.Then during recess i met abdullah and relax wif anwar.After that had my chem paper which i had no idea how to do.What the heck is molar masses?Relative atomic mass?Ionic/covalent bonding?I didn't even study.After the exam i went straight home with mathew. I decided not to wait for abdullah as his paper would end in like another 40 mins.Bastard rite me?So i alighted at cck mrt.. As i was walking in the shelter to go home there was this girl who is dressed in like all black.I glance at her."Woo.Chio.Got standard." She was also full of attitude. She was having this expressionless face.Turn me on!She had long dark hair and dark eyes..gothix.haha.Suprisingly, I caught her in the act looking at me when i glanced . So i just locked my eyes onto her and i noticed she had hers locked into me too.Didn't say a word . We walked past locking eyes onto one another.Reached home.I'm on my com now.Gonna play my cs la.Taste my headshot baby.Today not going SAF training la.. Too tired.. i wanna slack wif my com.Sayonara.

      WOah... Just came back from hendrix today... reach home bout 5am.. Damn it. my cs no form... so yea.. im writing this piece of shit right now.. Yesterday was happening .. haha... went to hendrix wif aidil... there was a lot of controversy before we headed there...First we wanted to go to JAMS the club , then aidil called his frens and they said they were going to ChinaBlack.So he thought we should go to ChinaBlack.But oh no.As i was using ARAB'S id. i feared that i wasn't allowed to go in.. Aidil just came from ktv wif his friends.. He was steaming and slightly drunk.. His nonsense was starting.. Everything we laughed and talked about he wanted to ^5.. As a good actor that i really am i played along ... FUCK U! It was getting irritating.I just came back from the Police Academy. My team ,SAF was vsing Home United.We lost 1-0. Argh ,i was not playing.. i took a 2mth long break from SAF until the coach called me to play back.. i was i my outside clothes.. The game was nice. SAF strikers and wingers cant seem to keep up wif the Feroz&Acak.Co. they were constant , they were calm,to cut it short,they defended well.There was high tension in the match.. Hard tackles. and quarrels that was stop by the referee.No yellows or reds suprisingly.ARGH. fuck la.. lose to HOME they were the unbeaten team in the league now..  So HendriX it was. Reached there at 10.15pm bought cigs.. Aidil was a stubborn ass.. I told him i wanted Marlboro or L&M but he wanted Sampoerna.FUCK.accomodating ppl was by best trait.Sampoerna it was even though i hated it. We went in Hendrix.. there was free flow.. i don consider my self an alcoholic..but when there's free drinks to swallow in.Count me in.I finished 9 glasses of vodka in like 15mins.. haha free wad? We met our friends there..Lots of them.. Shaking hands in weird ways.. Argh get over it boys.. im fuckin lazy to do tat kind of crap.We sat in a group ,smoked , talked cocked. Checking the chicks in da club.This friend of ours,a gal, was like standin in between us at the bar counter and was like talking to aidil.. i looked at her tits.how pervetic.haha when she walked away i and aidil had a good laugh over it.High ^5 was wad he wanted. There were alot of chicks in the club that night.Though , not many of them were dat beautiful..basically, not my type.I think the bartender was getting irritated with us.. Every 2 mins there was a glass to be refilled. 12AM. We hit the dancefloor.. there were four of us..1 of them brought his gal.. So there was ravers in the house. Me aidil and his fren.. i don bother to remember his name. We dance with each other in the 1st 15mins.. glancing at the chicks as well..OOO.The dancefloor was getting packed.. So indirectly, the chicks were pouring in. Then i spotted this gal.. cute sexy cool.. CHeeky.Me.She was like dancing with her 3 friends.. She glanced at me.. and i smiled.Mastering the art of smiling, i had been training.Be a good bitch tonight YEA?!So she was like beside me and we danced together.. Wrapped my arms around her waist. She had hers around my neck.Looked her in the eyes."YOU LITTLE CUTE BITCH!" was the thought in my heart. Aidil got this hot chick that was staring at him all the way. That was wad he claimed though.EEew... the chick was fat and ugly.. at least to me she was.. aidil must be blind.arr. FUCK IT!Dance dance dance.. the boys decided to get a breather outside the club.. As much as i don want to go, i had to follow them and leave the girl on her own. i don not want to be seen as a bastard.who pangse friends. After that we went back in,headed to the dancefloor . this time i was taking the lead.. there were plenty of guys in the club as well.Looks like the chicks were all taken.That was OK. Dancing with the other boys in da club hu were also my come-go friends. *JACKPOT* this gal was staring at me.. i know but did not give any signs.. just continued with my dance.. She was cute though.. Malay gals..Haix sian.ANd btw, the chinese gals in Hendrix are hot and i mean real HOT!ANiwaez Aidil continued with his fat bitch.how disgusting.Being the ego dude i've always been , i jus make those expressionless face and dance.. By now she was beside me.The other guys or "crocs" thats wad i called them.. were like trying very hard to dance with her.. She was full of attitude.. HAHA.. yea.. that was wad i like.. LET THE CHALLENGE BEGIN! She was like turning away from each of them.. I was laughing in my heart.. by now, i was slightly drunk as well.. She was dancing infront of me.. and i was like orrh wadeva..then suddenly SONG CHANGE. She grabbed me by by Shag band and like we started dancing . haha i was taken back.."Girl u gotta realise that some things are to big to fit in you."AHAH the ego man wins again.The song was "come to my hotel" and i was like singing "baby do u want to come to my hotel" she was like smiling.. OH WTF! A sluty bitch deprived of sex.She had big tits with matching ass.. Haix. yawnx. After a while , i was getting tired.. and bored.Took out my hp and looked at the time. It was nearing 2.30.Pretended that i was making a call and went out of the club.. tired manz. Now they aren't that many ehbasans in Hendrix.. and the guy who came up to me and said "Aku dah relak ar" didn't turn up. I was boyishly glad.Went back in, dance with this other chick as well. Touchy - touchy nothing special.. didn't spotted Aidil..Dance till closing time..As i was walking out of the club this gal suddenly started dancing rubbing against my ass.. fuck la whore.. closing already. Met aidil outside the club. Said i was headin home.. He was walking with the fat gal.. I for once thought that they were checking in a hotel.. Said Goodbye.. Took a long bus ride home... Slept my heart out in the bus. Lucky to be awake when it reached cck. Thank god.. Home at last.. Sweet Dreamz.Take care and don't take drugs.

Went wif Aidil n his friend nadira jessica laura 2 of nadirahs friend, ijah and nasha and another 2 of her frens which names i din bothered to know.. u'll understand y.. yea..... Woo... Met the national under 17 boys there shabbay n rasul.. my gay fren yasin and zaki and the gang....   It was fun though... Party ended at 6am.. OMg i was practically dead by then... Thank you nadirah for bringing ur frens ova... ijah was dead drop gorgeous she had this attitude and style.. Punk rock concept.&nbsp;and nasha.. Hot.. wad can i say... ahhaha.... But fuiyo... ijah has a bf... hrmm... too bad... I and ijah was playing hard to get in da club... hahah every guy neared her she turned away and every gal neared me i danced away... nadirah is a puss.... Fucking MATHUNTER! lolx... one day i must really snap at that cold hard bitch.. I tink she isnt suitable for hendrix... Lolx.. Girls being girls... hrmm.. i wonder y they like to backstab each other and talk behind their backs... I jus don get that mentally... Her friends were like telling me all her bad stuff... and yea.. i jus listened on... But of course.. after the conv ended. ... a paranoid nadira went up to me and asked .. did they say anything abt me.... And&nbsp;&nbsp; all i said was "no la.. u tink u so pretty ar ppl wanna tok abt u" obviously tt was a lie... i made it seemed like a joke so as she would not suspect any serious changes in my face when im lying... The things i heard were kinda bad... from the looks of it.. hrmm.. i tink i do believe them... The secret im gonna keep till i die... Ijah asked me to go out to 7-11 buy drink... OK! fuck ... nadira n her other fren followed... DAMN IT! bought big gulp and treated the gals a lollipop each.. CANDYMAN!Sat beside the river awhile.. before the nadirah and her other fren wanted to go back in... they called ijah.. Cheeky me... Used reverse psycohlogy and said.. u go in 1st la....&nbsp; haha... then she told nadirah she wanted to finish the drink 1st... which was actually already finishED!LOLX.. 1 on 1 time wif ijah... jus wad i wanted...Wee! Nasha.. Omg.. she was a power dancer... tt gal.. really noes how to shake her booty... Cant keep up wif her manz...Ijah actually commented on my dance... SHe said it was cool.. Im always cool gal...P.I.M.P   Shabbay.. u bloody ass.. He apparently got a month long break from national u17 training coz he bluffed the coach that he went to india and will be back on 3rd august... LOLX... He was a dick as usual... He went to this couple which was kissing and stuck out his hang and made the WOoo WOOoo stuff... lolx... the guy felt akward and stopped.. Jus cant stop laughing... ANd he was also a shameless pimp who just went up to girls and grabbed them by their hips wanting to dance wif them... got pushed by them half of the time.. ahahha. Rule: Nv go unless ure 100% confident.  Went home at 6am.. First train.. went home wif nad ijah nasha ijah's bf and her 2 other frens.. There's a gay that actually smiled at me in the guys toilet.. Being the no nonsense attitude kinda guy... i went up to him .. Stuck out my middle finger... (cautious to duck if he throwed a punch) and GO "FUCK U, U FUCKING GAY" .the glare.He was probably gayyified by then...   Took train... Home .... going wif ijah in the next next sat.... Yipee Yi Yo.   &nbsp;

      Shit.Im starting to blog with a 4 letter word now.It was a close call. Greece won? Yea.. Watched that fucked up match.It was a fluke la.Cmon la...Mr Scolari is a fucking stubborn cunt.He refused to start wif Nuno Gomez.Instead starting with Pauleta , who in the whole tournament.. hasn't a goal to his tally.Figo was trying to be 1 cheeky bastard.. Trying to weave his way thru the Greek Wall.And a Greek corner resulted in a goal from Caristeas.He such a fit guy.Costhina was day dreaming.. And OMG! Ricardo .. Only GOD knows y he came way out of his goal line trying to punch a ball he couldn't possibly have reached... Weird.. Mentally i don understand that..  Spiderman2.. Watched it on the opening day..Nice show manz... Who would ever have suspected a nerd to be a superhero..Yea.. Kirsten Dunst is hot...So is Kristin Kreuk in Smallville.. And Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Carribean.. I think gals starting with "K" is naturally hot..ahah.. Nonsense me...   Hrm.. Keep going out often these days.. Sat afternoon was purr-fect.Went to crc toa payoh wif my team.. Alright la.. Played against Nic's team... Won aztec 24-0 and dd2 20-4. Cool manz.. At least the boys now r performing... Hrm.. i played well too i guessed.. Eric cut his hair.. He looked like a dick now.. his 1.6 not bad...Yea.. Had my quick dinner wif Roy at 5.30pm // Ciaoz home.. Went out again at 7pm... Came home next morning..I wanna sleep... Have you ever think .. What if u sleep and nv woke up..? Freaks me.  Hrm... Im getting my grip now.. Im back.. I hope my hair can grow faster.. Any solutions? I should probably try yun nam hair care...Or should cut my armpit hair and paste it on my head... Erm.. would any1 notice tt?What i need now... erm... nothing i guess... I think i've got wad i wanted right here..Heard that Britney is getting married? Haha... She's gonna be the ala J'lo.It's gonna be a joke.. Fucking boring.. My msn is damn irritating...
