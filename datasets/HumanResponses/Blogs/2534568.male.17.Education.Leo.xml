        You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Your soul is OPEN-MINDED. Although you do have strong opinions and make decisions, you never make them without thinking first of not only everything that is, but those that may not be as well. People trust that you'll willingly hear them out and understand when they tell you something, and you are well-liked for it. You are often the mediator in disputes and your desire to do what is right overcomes all else. You are an understanding and admirable soul.  I guess so...

        You're addicted to.....Nothing! Your addicted to nothing at all? Well..... ok I guess thats a good thing but come on just think of the possibilities!   I dunno, I'd be sappy and say love, but the test made no room for such a result... I'll take what I can get, even if it happens to be nothing.

        Sandals- peaceful, daydreamy, and thoughtful, you often find yourself staring into space.  When you aren't out volunteering you are often just dreaming away.  You enjoy the company of friends sometimes but enjoy peace and quiet. [please vote! thank you! :)]    I somehow doubt that just a little... I don't even like sandals...

        cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed  I'm laughing my ass off right now!!! I'm sorry but I must agree wholeheartedly on this one. I was thinking it'd be a hug or something, not realizing this was one of the results. But yea, I really do think this is me... Jaime might agree, seeing as I do, do that. (awkward word usage there, yucka).

      PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  I got rid of the pic because it was nasty... I tell ya...

        You have a dominant kiss- you take charge and make sure your partner can feel it! Done artfully, it can be very satisfactory if he/she is into you playing the dominant role MEORW!  I dunno what my baby thinks of that one...

        This is my first post ya'll. It seems as though everyone else is getting sites and I'm curious as to how well my blonde brain can handle this, woohoo! I'm obviously in the process of setting it up, so give me some feedback and let me know what I need to do and/or fix to make this sucker work. I'll probably go to James for help on this thing. Well off to figure out what i can do with this baby!

      Well everyone is finally gone. I feel really drained and really alone. I hate feeling this way. No matter how many people I may be talking to or be around, I just feel so totally alone, lost in the world, fighting to find my way to the surface. I'm stuck in something that I'm not sure i can get out of, the worst part is that I cant specifically pick out what has me trapped.

      We are having a Memorial Day picnic a day early. My house is filled with people. My uncle john brought this guy Josh.....I know I've seen him before, but still........OMG he is so fucking hot!!!! And he is bi! I love gay and bi guys, they are hot and cool. On the other hand today is also kinda a downer...people dont stick to their word. I had two friends tell me that they would call me today, one when he got up and the other when he got home. I haven't gotten any calls today. Oh well, I didn't really expect the first to call, he never does when he says he will. The other I did expect to call, but I'll live. Also I've had Nicky all day without anyone to really help me with him. Its a  fight to find someone willing to take him so that I can go to the bathroom. Hell, my biggest help was Josh and he ain't even family.

       Oh it's about time i got to this. The point of this site is mainly ranting. A way to get things out, not always bad either, sometimes you just gotta rant about all the goodness. If you'd like to become a writer on here to be able to get things out, let me know. I also have the tag board so we can all comunicate like one big happy family. This is a release site, no more games, no facades, just honest writting, with the occasional thing that makes no sense whatsoever. If you don't like that. Oh well!

       Oh people really annoy me sometimes. First you got those that have to know everything that you are saying to another person. Then those that lie to get their way, those that lie to attempt not to hurt another. There are those that say one thing and then act entirely opposite of that. Then there are the "friends" that dont want anything to do with you over something so incredibly stupid. Ah, the people who think that they should kill themselves because of another person. Those that mess around with others feelings. The people that like to hurt others to make themselves feel better. And then just those that have been annoying me.  If you are reading this and happen to fall in the catagories, I'm sorry. This doesn't even apply to some people. Just my way of getting out my frustration and anger at certain people that are annoying me lately without using names and offending people.

      Oh my goodness, I posted somethin! Holy crap.  Anyways, I noticed something... Why exactly is it that both the pages that Katie 'owns' (per se) are negative? Katie's Hellhole and Life of the Lonely, really doesn't sound fun... nope. I have an idea!!! We can come up with a new blog and call it  urlLink PansyFruitMuffin  and have it be all gleeful and stuff, wouldn't that be fun? ....No? Well, I tried anyway. Back to the negativity, I'm done being stupid for now.

       Well it's been awhile since I've posted. I don't really have much to rant about right now......  Here is a song that I love, it's one of my absloute favorites. Yeah, yeah, yeah.....I know, it's a sappy stupid song to some of you, but oh well you'll get over it.      Because You Loved Me     by: Celine Dion    For all those times you stood by me For all the truth that you made me see For all the joy you brought to my life For all the wrong that you made right For every dream you made come true For all the love I found in you I'll be forever thankful baby You're the one who held me up Never let me fall You're the one who saw me through through it all  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You gave me wings and made me fly You touched my hand I could touch the sky I lost my faith, you gave it back to me You said no star was out of reach You stood by me and I stood tall I had your love I had it all I'm grateful for each day you gave me Maybe I don't know that much But I know this much is true I was blessed because I was loved by you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You were always there for me The tender wind that carried me A light in the dark shining your love into my life You've been my inspiration Through the lies you were the truth My world is a better place because of you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  I'm everything I am Because you loved me    Written By: D.

      o0o0o0o0o My baby Jaime joined! Yay! But she don't know what to write... boo... Something will come of it, I can feel it in my toes! Or is my foot just asleep? Either way I'm feeling something tingly here. All kinds of new paths are presenting themselves at this very moment, well, maybe not, but I'd sure like to look at it that way. Kinda like earlier today... it was quite boring ya know, all I did was clean my car. But you put a whole new spin on it when you mention that I nearly killed myself with Raid because my car happend to be infested with angry wasps and ugly big nasty spiders, then its an adventure. Made for TV movie I tell ya. But I don't know what the heck I'm talking about, I'm too darn tired. I think some sleep ought to do me some good. So, adios amigos, the village idiot James must run off to bed now.

      Yeah its been awhile, I know. And it sucks, but it's gonna be longer. My parents are being a pain and I'm not allowed online.&nbsp; They also said I am only allowed the phone to talk to Malcolm (for any that didnt know, that's my boyfriend ^_^), so I'm getting annoyed with them a lot, but I must keep my control. I'll write when I can.

      Bad poetry is what I write, It makes no sense to you, But its the only way, I'll get these things, Out of my head...  No rhymes, no coordination, Just words on paper, With sentences, That are almost all the same length. ('cept for that one.)  Bad poetry, Its my forte, I'd be nothing... without my, Bad poetry.  sporadic and uneven... All that it is, Is crap wrapped in silk...  But its all I got, The only way, To show all the world, What its like, To be me... To love like me, To be angry like me, To laugh like me, To be sad like me.

       You'd have to read The Grapes Of Wrath to understand...:  Man walks along the railroad track He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge The shelter line stretchin' around the corner Welcome to the New World Order Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!  And The highway is alive tonight Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes I'm sitting down here in the campfire light Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad  He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass With a one way ticket to the promised land With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts  And The highway is alive tonight Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light With the Ghost of old Tom Joad  Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy Wherever a hungry new born baby cries Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air Look for me ma' I'll be there Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand For a decent job or a helpin' hand Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free Look in their eyes ma, You'll see me!  And the highway is alive tonight nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light With the Ghost of Tom Joad.

      dead leaves and the dirty ground when I know you're not around shiny tops and soda pops when I hear your lips make a sound when I hear your lips make a sound  thirty notes in the mailbox will tell ya that I'm coming home and I think I'm gonna stick around for a while so you're not alone for a while so you're not alone  if you can hear a piano fall you can hear me coming down the hall if I can just hear your pretty voice I don't think I need to see at all don't think I need to see at all  soft hair and a velvet tongue I wanna give ya what you give to me and every breath that is in your lungs is a tiny little gift to me is a tiny little gift to me  I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down then I come home no one to wrap my arms around wrap my arms around  well any man with a microphone can tell you what he loves the most and you know why you love at all if you're thinking of the holy ghost if you're thinking of the holy ghost

      You know, its kinda funny how everything I do somehow involves you. I can never seem to get away from you, I doubt I can spend five minutes without thinking of you. I’m supposed to be doing Algebra, Researching Religion, Reading my books, but somehow you get into it, and once that happens its all over. You’re in my music, you’re in my movies, you’re in my classes, yet you feel so far away. I can hardly remember what it was like to be without you, even though it was only 3 months ago that I met you; and if I do find something to do that doesn’t have anything to do with you I lose interest in it, just doesn’t seem worth the while. But I really don’t mind it, its not a problem at all, unless I lose you. I’d be lost, thrown astray, I figure I’d find my way again though I think I’d give up on love… Because losing the person I love the most would tell me I’m not meant to love anyone… You’re my everything, and its ironic that the one time I used to be able to forget everything doing (Independent Study), has been taken up by thoughts of you… I love you

Yeah, how long must you wait for it? Yeah, how long must you pay for it? Yeah, how long must you wait for it? For it...  I was scared, I was scared, Tired and underprepared, But I'll wait for it.  If you go, if you go, And leave me down here on my own, then I'll wait for you.  Yeah, how long must you wait for it? Yeah, how long must you pay for it? Yeah, how long must you wait for it? For it, ya...  Singin' please, please, please, Come back come and sing to me, To me, me.  Come on and sing it out, now, now. Come on and sing it out, to me, me. Come back and sing to me.  In my place, in my place, Were lines that I couldn't change, I was lost, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

      The past few days, my mind has wandered To places that have scared me I don't know why I thought that way I guess I needed a distraction A distraction from the feelings I have Feelings of confusion, of love lost, and loneliness Spurred by things I cannot fathom Something inside of me turned that confusion Into distrust, neglect, misjudgment My mind has wandered into these things And my heart had to drag it back out Thinking too much, instead of just being Just being in peace, in love, in charge In charge of my feelings, and where they lead me. Its funny to think, that the whole time, That I felt like things were wrong, I stilled lived for you, I went out I functioned on the basis that I loved you. So it goes to show me, my mind wasn't right, I guess it was bored, needed something to do Thing upon thing added up in my head And disillusioned I came to a conclusion That wasn't in the right, wasn't kosher But my heart carried me through the confusion And brought me where I'm supposed to be Right here with you, where I started Loving you like no other,  loving you And not forgetting that I do.

      I almost sabotaged myself today My world almost caved in My mind went on a tangent My music sent me a message I went with it for awhile Untill I realized I almost lost you there For a second I thought I didn't love you Then something kicked in And told me "You love that girl" Told me, "Do you realize who that is?" "That girl you love?" I saw your face and I sunk to the ground I changed the music Found something that reminded me Of my love for you Something that you showed me The second I heard it I fell in love all over again I never lost it in the first place I just lost sight of you

      My heart... If it breaks now, The mending will be easy. If it breaks later, The scarring will be permanent.  My mind... If it has its way, The mending will be easy. If it doesn't, The future is uncertain.  My soul... If it wasn't in control, The mending would be easy. But since it is, I make the right decisions.  My love... Was in jeopardy, Without anyone knowing. But it abides by my soul, So I don't make stupid decisions.  My fingers... Type this poem, With a hidden meaning. But the real one is blatant, I love you, and I always will  So long as you love me.

      Missing you... Its not as hard as it used to be, Something in me has changed, I've begun to expect, That our plans won't work out. It used to hurt me so much, And for a time it turned to anger, But now its burlesque. I do feel quite lonely, And my heart yearns for you, But there is nothing I can do. So I put my feelings down, Because feeling so badly, Doesn't move us forward. Though it makes me want to give up, I stick it out for you, Because you are my love, And I'm willing to suffer now, As long as when later comes, You'll be there for me.

       This was on my other blog, but I like it alot, so I figured I'd put it in my literature blog:  I'm madly in love with you and there's nothing you can do I love you from top to bottom; inside and out You are the missing piece to my puzzle a puzzle rearranged in oh so many ways that it started to not make sense anymore then you came and set things right you made me a better person, you changed me life has purpose now, life has posture you mean the world to me baby and I'd give up mine if it meant being with you you are an undiscovered wisdom, a philosophy its own and I want to know more, more about anything, more about you you make me crazy girl, but its all alright as long as you love me too, what could go wrong? but thats what I'm supposed to think and feel being naive about the whole lot but sometimes being naive is the only thing you can do when the future drives you insane but am I really naive to think the way I do? one might think so, but I don't follow that line of reasoning I see my love as everlasting, so why can't we be that too? there's nothing that can stop us river, valley, mountain, ocean, they all mean nothing the connection we have doesn't see those things it looks past, beyond, not looking back, not caring for what we have is headstrong and lovely beautiful like the universe in all its wonder a thing without a name, only a description a description really too long to word just ineffable love that goes on and on forever in our hearts forever in our minds

      Everyday I find I'm loving you more The things you do, simple as they are Inspire these emotions in my mind That make me admire you so much My eyes fill with awe to look at you And see you so simply beautiful  Makes me forget sometimes  That you are just my girlfriend I feel closer than that Standing here watching you Loving you for what you are You're Standing over there Not knowing that I'm thinking these things Thinking I want to provide for you Thinking I want to let you rest Thinking I want you to just be happy Wanting you to smile all your life No matter what the cost to me And when you ask me what I'm thinking I say 'nothing' because all these things Are too much for me to explain Because there is more to it Than can be evident in my words Though I do wish you knew Its just so hard to say it to you Because I feel I might come off Being a fool, or naive, or stupid But I love you so much And I have to cheat and write it down So that maybe you'll see this And understand how much I love you Because you are everything to me Jaime

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day You got me in a spin but everything is A.O.K!  Touching you, touching me Touching you god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh! Guitar!  Touching you, touching me Touching you god you're touching me,OOooow!!!!!  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!

      all these things I do, i do them for you, all these things are in your honor. Constantly creating so that maybe I might just find something that represents how much i feel for you. All the things I wish I could say to you, just so that you might understand how much I love you. Seems to me it doesn't do you any good just to see these things. One of these days I'll just have to outright say it... Maybe I'm just afraid to, but why? You love me, whats there to be afraid of...?

       War  My heart slowed down just the other day And my mind followed suit They both took it upon themselves To wage a war inside my body Day by day I slowed down more Thoughts repeating with my music The days drew longer and sadder I know the antidote but I cannot get it Someone else caged her away from me So for now I live on what hope I have But also with the knowledge of repetition What’s happened before will happen again And I'll soon be feeling this way once more The only thing that keeps me moving On that sublevel I'm at Is the notion that one day her and I  Will both be free, will be together But until the day that freedom is consecrated My heart and mind will duke it out And hopefully neither will win Because I tread a dangerously thin line Between what I should do and shouldn't do And to falter from that limbo at this moment Would mean the end of all that means anything to me   Perplexed  I hide my feelings sometimes  Because I feel they are too strong I think I might scare you away And crush my spirit into oblivion I've told you some of my feelings And you didn't run away from me But since then my feelings grew And they are stronger than before My beliefs are getting stronger too But I still try and hide them Thinking you know how I feel But I don't complete your picture So it’s impossible for you to know This will keep on going on and on Till the day I confide them to you And we'll be together forever But until that actually happens Things’ll stay the same for us Unless you force it out of me But I want to tell you everything And maybe I will now instead And right at this very moment You are as perplexed as I   Strong  The day I saw you I was perplexed I out of the blue rejected you But I had to spend the day with you And I fell for you I was mad about you But I acted cool with my friends 'cause I'd look weak if I loved a girl I hardly knew But now that I'm with you I show everyone how great you are And they get sick of it, And they say I'm weak for the little things I do That remind me of you But they can't see through the fog They don't see us together Otherwise they'd know I was the strongest guy in the world   Lover  My lover is better than yours She is the most beautiful She’s smarter than your lover She’s more clever than yours too I look at her and see All my dreams come true I see all the happiness in the world Even if she is down We really aren't lovers But it feels that way to me Because when we are together Nothing else matters All that is there is our love For one another, for our lives That’s why my lover is better than yours She makes me complete, and yours doesn't Why’d I want your lover anyway? I'm not into that kinda thing The only person I love Is down the street and always there Even if I can't get to her right away She’ll be there the next week Or day or minute or second In my heart or mind, and hers too   Looking In  My heart is a needy one And it’s being malnourished Not on purpose mind you It’s just the way things are I look at your picture And I smile inside But outside there is a straight face Because my heart yearns  But my mind thinks It first thinks of the good times Because the heart told it to And then it thinks of oppression How you aren't allowed to be you And then I feel badly for you Though, my mind does wonder, I guess that isn't my business But my heart wants it to be For my heart also tends to be greedy And I'm in the middle of it all Outside looking in   Virus  The notes come from the instrument And enter my ear My mind organizes the information And stores it away A virus fools with the storage And relates the music Into things it wasn't meant to be Those things are memories And good ones at that But the virus knows my situation And ferments the memories into sadness My mind tries to sort it out And falsely claims victory Giving my emotions an unreasonable high But the virus knows better And cuts the legs out from under me Making me fall from my high place To the depression that has become the ground Until you come and pick me up again    Stop Light  The gear changes The car goes faster Red light comes on Car slows and stops Light changes Another one is near Red again Driver stops Starts to see more Through the fog Driver is tired Tired of slowing Tired of stopping All the lights are red And all he wants  Is to get to the end Of the side street To pick up his girl To move on with life To grow up But people do things  That turn on red lights And they don't realize it But he does And he wonders Should he take the chance? And blow through the lights Grow up too quickly Force freedom on his girl Get into a crash Get a citation Compromise his future Or should he sit And go by the rules Do what is expected Stop go stop go Experience each light  In its entirety So if he comes up On one again He’ll know what to do And the next light Won’t be so bad And maybe his girl Will see him And go to where he is Get in the car And sit through the light too Knowing what's going to come At the end of that road

      When she was three  Her Barbies always did it on the first date Now she's with me,  There's never any need for them to demonstrate  She's like a baby, I'm like a cat; When we are happy, we both get fat and still It's never enough, It's never enough, It's never enough  But I don't tend to worry 'bout the things that other people say And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way Call me crazy but it really doesn't matter All that matters to me is she  Her life in a nutshell No way would she want it to change me It's not that easy 'cause  My time is often decided for me For me  She memorized every pencil crayon color in the box Her blue-green eyes complement the burnt sienna in her locks She's at the movies, I'm on the phone; When we're separated, we're never alone, but still It's never enough, It's never enough, No it's never enough  So I tend not to worry 'bout the things that other people say And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way Call me crazy but it really doesn't matter All that matters to me is she  Her life in a nutshell No way would she want it to change me It's not that easy 'cause  My time is often decided for me For me  I fell down with no one there to catch me from falling Then she came 'round And only her tenderness stopped me from bawling my eyes out I'm OK, and that's why  Her life in a nutshell No way would she want it to change me It's not that easy 'cause  My time is often decided for me For me  But I don't tend to worry 'bout the things that other people say And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way Call me crazy but it really doesn't matter All that matters to me is she

       When  I remember the days The ones that meant nothing The carefree ones West of the Mississippi Far away from the sea The dry barren desert Such a skeletal soothing place Miles away from things that matter Clear skies, fast roads Nights of fantasy... I remember being there Being at peace That’s how I know That’s there is more than this This place This life Here   Ass kicked  I got my ass kicked And it's fine All is well My prerogative has not changed I found out something It changed my mind Changed me forever And I don't know what it is    You  I need you I feel you I want you You are I And I am you Selfism Neurotic Me, I, you All one Where did you go?   Where  The place I want to be It’s in your heart It’s in your eyes It’s the place no one knows The place where reality isn't real The place where nothing matters Just you and me That’s where I want to be The edge of the world   Me’s  The other me is in the prison You know the one in my head It keeps the dangerous me's in place A stern strong prison it is Only a few have escaped Making me a very boring person There are thousands of me We all congregate on occasion Debate, joke, think, argue... Sometimes they get out of hand And need to be put away That’s when I lose motivation And sit, and sit, and become oblivious to everything Someone needs to destroy the prison I need a revolution of the mind Someone needs to let the fun me out The interesting me The real me, the one your supposed to know   I Love You  I love you You are the motivation that drives me You make me work You make me whole I love you The world would be scary without you You set things right You’re so beautiful I love you You set the standard You are always right You make me sad I love you You created the plot twist You changed things You barged in Let’s see where things go from here   I hate you  I hate you You are horrible You are so stupid Putrid Nasty You are the anti-Christ I wish you'd leave me be You fucking idiot You made me this way I hate you I could have been something else... But you fucked that up... I don't know who you are  But you did this    Something  There is something inside of me It’s always there churning It keeps me going It is an emotion of no other kind It has no sense of judgment It sits and watches, listens But it has no motivation To touch the outside of me To interact with others, It’s a virus... It gives a false sense of being Makes one feel like all is fine But it really isn't It’s a slow death full of falsified joy And contradictions of the mind It’s taking over...     I wrote these awhile ago, around the end of December, it’s fun for me to look back on what I thought in those days because I’ve changed since then. 2004 is the year everything changed for me, it didn’t happen right away, it took a day to settle in, January 2nd 2004 is a day that will be imprinted on my mind forever. The day I met the love of my life. She was the thing that motivated me now to change the way I felt about life. And I thank/love her ever so deeply for that.  My favorite one is "I Love You" because it makes me think of the girl I love. Even though I wrote the poem three days before I met her, I still think its about her, because (and its a lil freaky) that whole last part about 'you changed things...barged in...' is exactly what happened, maybe it was meant to be? Ah, who knows...

      Well, after I'm not sure how long, I've decided to put this blog back on the map... I think I'm going to use it for my literature, that's the only thing I can come up with right now. The name doesn't quite fit anymore, but I don't really care, I guess it could kind of work in a way. I'm not sure how I'm going to fiddle with the template, I just pulled this up at the spur of the moment. I'm really desperate to find something to do that'll keep my mind off of things that are making feel crappy. We'll see how far I get with this...

      I fall into my bed, wishing you were there. I wake up in the morning, wanting you next to me. I eat my breakfast, hoping I could make you some. I ride the bus to school, With an empty seat next to me.  I reserve all this space for you, but you're not here to take it. It's not like you can anyway, But honestly if you could... ...would you want to?

      I want to talk to you, I really really do, about god and love and all But the words never come to me I think all the day long, But when I see you, All thought escapes me, I hope you don't mind, Because I love you dearly, And I want to do is share my life with you, But when all I have is a few hours, Everything goes out the window, And I devote myself to you, Even if I don't speak it...  I just want to be there with you.

       Kinda fruity, but w/e:  Light dances across the mountains Black and white, so simple Such a pretty picture Takes me from this place Just for awhile I'm gone Lost in the beauty of it Hard to believe such things exist When all I see in the world today Is the travesty on my television Funny how that peice of paper Sitting here next to me Has so much more meaning and expresses more emotion than those figures on the tele Take me away, show me How things really are, When all there is... ...Is you and the earth Standing there, waiting for you, To tread across and discover What it is that drives you.

       It's just me being crazy, It's about something, but nobody'll get it, trust me:  I see you in me Don't go away, I need you to be there Don't be suppressed You know you can handle it Don't walk away You've always been there My rhyme and reason Without you, I'm lost Lost in a sea of heads With people I don't know So please, Stay for awhile So I might have some comfort.

       Don't know who it's by   I’ve heard there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don’t really care for music do you? It goes like this – the fourth, the fifth The minor fall, the major lift The baffled King composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  Your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you She tied you to a kitchen chair She broke your throne, and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the hallelujah  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  Maybe I’ve been here before I know this room, I’ve walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch Love is not a victory march It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  There was a time when you let me know What’s real and going on below But now you never show it to me, do you? And remember when I moved in you The Holy Dark was moving too And every breath we drew was hallelujah  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  Maybe there’s a God above And all I ever learned from love Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you And it’s not a cry you can hear at night It’s not somebody who’s seen the light It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

       Brown Eyed Girl  Hey where did we go,  Days when the rains came  Down in the hollow,  Playin' a new game,  Laughing and a running hey, hey  Skipping and a jumping  In the misty morning fog with  Our hearts a thumpin' and you  My brown eyed girl,  You my brown eyed girl.   Whatever happened  To Tuesday and so slow  Going down the old mine  With a transistor radio  Standing in the sunlight laughing,  Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,  Slipping and sliding  All along the water fall, with you  My brown eyed girl,  You my brown eyed girl.   Do you remember when we used to sing,  Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da   So hard to find my way,  Now that I'm all on my own.  I saw you just the other day,  My how you have grown,  Cast my memory back there, Lord  Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout  Making love in the green grass  Behind the stadium with you  My brown eyed girl  You my brown eyed girl   Do you remember when we used to sing  Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da.    I'm A Believer  I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get me That's the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my dreams Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried  I thought love was more or less a giving thing Seems the more I gave, the less I got What's the use in trying All you get is pain When I needed sunshine, I got rain  Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried    I can't find out exactly who did the originals, these songs have been redone a million times, if you know, tell me...   I love you Jaime.

      The lord is my shepard, I shall not want; he makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies; thou anointest my head with oil, my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the lord for ever.   Only reason I posted it was because I just came across it a minute ago as I was looking through my bible for no apparent reason and have decided it is my favorite verse in the bible. It shows me I have nothing to worry about as long as I have faith in the lord...   Btw, I'm not preaching to my readers and I'm not trying to force anything on anyone either, I'm just voicing my beliefs, take of them what you will.

       I tried at least...   The sun rises over the eastern mountains Light curls around the land like a mothers embrace Warmth flows through the rivers and streams Flowers awaken to the sounds of a new day Fresh air billows from the trees Midday comes through with vengeance The light scorches the earth with heat The tides take out the morning's garbage Humid air chokes the wilting flowers Bugs aimlessly run about the wilds Evening settles in late The light dims over the plains Fresh rain falls from the thunderheads A humid chill cools off the asphalt The flowers begin to disappear Thunder and lightning keep us in... Until the sun rises over the eastern mountains again.

      You are Stellar  Meet me in outer space. We could spend the night; watch the earth come up. I've grown tired of that place; won't you come with me? We could start again.  How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. How do you do it? It's better than I ever knew.  Meet me in outer space. I will hold you close, if you're afraid of heights. I need you to see this place, it might be the only way  that I can show you how it feels to be inside of you.  How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. How do you do it? It's better than I ever knew. How do you do it? Make me feel like I do.  You are stellar, You are stellar.  How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. How do you do it? It's better than I ever knew. How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. Yeah!

      So, you know how people are When it's all gone much too far The way their minds are made Still, there's something you should know That I could not let show That fear of letting go  And in this in moment, I need to be needed With this darkness all around me I like to be liked In this emptyness and fear I wanna be wanted 'Cuz I love to be loved, I love to be loved I love to be loved, yes I love to be loved  I cry, the way the babies cry The way they can't deny The way they feel Words the climb all over you, 'till they uncover you From where you hide  And in this moment I need to be needed When my self- esteem is sinking I like to be liked In this emptyness and fear, I wanna be wanted 'Cuz I love to be loved, I love to be loved I love to be loved, ohh I love to be loved  This old familiar craving I've been here before, this way of behaving Don't know who the hell I'm saving anymore Let it pass, let it go, let it leave From the deepest place I grieve This time I believe And then I let go, And then I let go I can't let go of it Though it takes all the strength in me And all the world can see  I'm losing such a central part of me I can't let go of it  You know I mean it You know that I mean it I recognize how much I've lost But I cannot face the cost  'Cuz I love to be loved, Yes I love to be loved I love to be loved, Yes I love to be loved I love to be loved, Yes I love to be loved I love to bel oved, I love to be loved I love to be loved, Yes I love to be loved

      The time I like is the rush hour, cos I like the rush The pushing of the people - I like it all so much Such a mass of motion - do not know where it goes I move with the movement and ... I have the touch  I'm waiting for ignition, I'm looking for a spark Any chance collision and I light up in the dark There you stand before me, all that fur and all that hair Oh, do I dare ... I have the touch  Wanting contact I'm wanting contact I'm wanting contact with you Shake those hands, shake those hands Give me the thing I understand Shake those hands, shake those hands Shake those hands, shake those hands  Any social occasion, it's hello, how do you do All those introductions, I never miss my cue So before a question, so before a doubt My hand moves out and ... I have the touch  Wanting contact I'm wanting contact I'm wanting contact with you Shake those hands, shake those hands Give me the thing I understand Shake those hands, shake those hands  Pull my chin, stroke my hair, scratch my nose, hug my knees Try drink, food, cigarette, tension will not ease I tap my fingers, fold my arms, breathe in deep, cross my legs Shrug my shoulders, stretch my back - but nothing seems  to please  I need contact I need contact Nothing seems to please I need contact

      They say that every father has a dream for his family, the say that every mother has a dream for her family, and I could suppose that most everybody else has a dream for their future. I think that my dream is a fairly simple one. I want to be able to support my baby, and if she wills it, I want to be able to spend the rest of my life with her. I want to be able to put my past experiences to work for my family, I want to be able to teach people from what I've been through in my life (whether insignificant or not), I want my life to be put to use. I want to be able to take my baby to the places I've been and share new experiences with her, I want to go out west again and see everything from a new point of view. Basically, I want to make my baby happy, and if I could do that I wouldn't need to do anything else. I'd rather mean the world to one person than mean everything to the world. If she is happy, then I am happy. And when she isn't happy, I want to be right there with her supporting her, giving her someone to lean on. I suppose it'd sound a little strange to some people to be so wrapped up in one person, but I love her so dearly I can't imagine being anyother way. So whatever my future may hold, as long as it is with my baby, and I can support her and take her out to all the places that mean something to me, I can live with it. If she's not in my future, well, I think I know what I'd do, pretty much the same thigns I plan to do, just X out the Jaime parts and add the word recluse in... But for now I have my Jaime, and thats all that really matters, don't have to worry about a future without her.  Will my dream come true? Well, thats up to my baby...

      Time goes by and God knows I try to carry on with life  Decide not to hide feelings inside, even though they hurt  Sometimes, I forget to remember you  It's easy to lock away the pains, don't want to relive it through  But I stay strong, you taught me how to move on in this world  I married my sweetheart, even got a little baby girl  I wish you could see her, I swear she looks just like you  If you can hear me, show me a sign, please send her a butterfly or two   [chorus:] I'm thinking about forever (missing you)  I know you're so much better (we made it through)   Now I know what it means to live for someone else  To give up yourself  Things have changed, at times it gets kind of strange  Your love remains the same  Do I make you proud? Mama, can you see me now?  Whatever is good in me is because you showed me how to take love by the hand  And so now I can share you with my baby  So that she can understand   [chorus]  [ending chorus:] I'm thinking about forever (missing you)  I know you're so much better (we made it through)  I'm thinking about forever (missing you)  I'm tripping on whatever (hearing you)

      River, river carry me on Living river carry me on River, river carry me on To the place where I come from  So deep, so wide, will you take me on your back for a ride If I should fall, would you swallow me deep inside  River, show me how to float I feel like I'm sinking down Thought that I could get along But here in this water My feet won't touch the ground I need something to turn myself around  Going away, away towards the sea River deep, can you lift up and carry me Oh roll on though the heartland 'Til the sun has left the sky River, river carry me high 'Til the washing of the water make it all alright Let your waters reach me like she reached me tonight  Letting go, it's so hard The way it's hurting now To get this love untied So tough to stay with thing 'Cause if I follow through I face what I denied I get those hooks out of me And I take out the hooks that I sunk deep in your side Kill that fear of emptiness, loneliness I hide  River, oh river, river running deep Bring me something that will let me get to sleep In the washing of the water will you take it all away Bring me something to take this pain away

      The wretched desert takes its form, the jackal proud and tight In search of you, I feel my way, though the slowest heaving night Whatever fear invents, I swear it make no sense I reach through the border fence Come down, come talk to me  In the swirling, curling storm of desire unuttered words hold fast With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes towers built to last Darkness creeps in like a thief and offers no relief Why are you shaking like a leaf Come on, come talk to me  Ah please talk to me Won't you please talk to me We can unlock this misery Come on, come talk to me  {Chorus 1:} I did not come to steal This all is so unreal Can't you show me how you feel now Come on, come talk to me Come talk to me [x2]  The earthly power sucks shadowed milk from sleepy tears undone From nippled skin as smooth as silk the bugles blown as one You lie there with your eyes half closed like there's no-one there at all There's a tension pulling on your face Come on, come talk to me  Won't you please talk to me If you'd just talk to me Unblock this misery If you'd only talk to me  {Chorus 2:} Don't you ever change your mind Now your future's so defined And you act so deaf and blind [And you act so deaf so blind] Come on, come talk to me Come talk to me [x2]  I can imagine the moment Breaking out through the silence All the things that we both might say And the heart it will not be denied 'Til we're both on the same damn side All the barriers blown away  I said please talk to me Won't you please come talk to me Just like it used to be Come on, come talk to me I did not come to steal This all is so unreal Can you show me how you feel now Come on, come talk to me Come talk to me [x2]  I said please talk to me If you'd just talk to me Unblock this misery If you'd only talk to me [Chorus 2]

      A feeling comes to me like a rolling steam train, Energy surges through my every nerve, My heart stops for a moment, And I haven't a care in the world,  Feeling your lips pressed against mine, For the singular solitary moment, you take me to a higher place, where no one else ever could.  In that moment I know I love you, and I couldn't love anyone else, Not the way I love you, You're all I've ever wished for.  Its the moment I've been waiting for, To connect with someone like you, In all your beauty and grandeur, And I have to thank you for that.

      looking down on empty streets, all she can see are the dreams all made solid are the dreams all made real  all of the buildings, all of those cars were once just a dream in somebody's head  she pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steam she pictures a soul with no leak at the seam  lets take the boat out wait until darkness let's take the boat out wait until darkness comes  nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey nowhere in the suburbs in the cold light of day  there in the midst of it so alive and alone words support like bone  dreaming of mercy st. wear your inside out dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms again dreaming of mercy st. 'swear they moved that sign dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms  pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth tugging at the darkness, word upon word  confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box to the priest-he's the doctor he can handle the shocks  dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips of kissing Mary's lips  dreaming of mercy st. wear your insides out dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms again dreaming of mercy st. 'swear they moved that sign looking for mercy in your daddy's arms  mercy, mercy, looking for mercy mercy, mercy, looking for mercy  Anne, with her father is out in the boat riding the water riding the waves on the sea

       I'm in a poetic drought (so-to-speak), so bear with me, I have my ideas, but, I'll have to post lyrics for now...    You'll remember me when the west wind moves Upon the fields of barley You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky As we walk in fields of gold So she took her love for to gaze awhile Upon the fields of barley In his arms she fell as her hair came down Among the fields of gold  Will you stay with me, will you be my love Among the fields of barley? We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky As we lie in fields of gold See the west wind move like a lover so Upon the fields of barley Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth Among the fields of gold  I never made promises lightly And there have been some that I've broken But I swear in the days still left We'll walk in fields of gold We'll walk in fields of gold  Many years have passed since those summer days Among the fields of barley See the children run as the sun goes down Among the fields of gold You'll remember me when the west wind moves Upon the fields of barley You can tell the sun in his jealous sky When we walked in fields of gold When we walked in fields of gold When we walked in fields of gold

       I've posted it before on FlamingPinkFlamingo, but it's a nice song, so until I can write something new here ya go:  Climbing up on Solsbury Hill I could see the city light Wind was blowing, time stood still Eagle flew out of the night He was something to observe Came in close, I heard a voice Standing stretching every nerve Had to listen had no choice I did not believe the information (I) just had to trust imagination My heart going boom boom boom "Son," he said "Grab your things, I've come to take you home."  To keepin' silence I resigned My friends would think I was a nut Turning water into wine Open doors would soon be shut So I went from day to day Tho' my life was in a rut "Till I thought of what I'd say Which connection I should cut I was feeling part of the scenery I walked right out of the machinery My heart going boom boom boom "Hey" he said "Grab your things I've come to take you home." (Back home.)  When illusion spin her net I'm never where I want to be And liberty she pirouette When I think that I am free Watched by empty silhouettes Who close their eyes but still can see No on taught them etiquette I will show another me Today I don't need a replacement I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant My heart going boom boom boom "Hey" I said "You can keep my things, they've come to take me home."

      Jaime,  Sometimes when I look at you, it's hard to believe that we are together, You look too beautiful for me. I kow its hard for you to believe sometimes, But I really do think you are beautiful, I think you are more than that,  I see something more in you, Something I can't explain, all I can tell you... ...is that I'm in love with it. Your eyes glisten in the night,  and I get lost in them. Your hair curves down your face, and around your neck beautifully. Your lips are soft and sexy. Your skin is smooth and wonderful. But I see more in you than I can voice, there is something about you that draws me in. I can't resist you, I die inside if I do. No one has made me feel that way before, I'm glad it was you, because you're a sweet person, I can trust my heart with you, and I love that. I know I can count on you to be there for me,  and I know I can count on your love, thank you so much Jaime. I couldn't have fallen in love with a better person. I'll always love you baby.

      Come over to me, put your arms around me, hold me close to you, bring your lips to mine, fall in love with me. Fall deep and far, and don't look back. Move with me, feel my heart against yours, put your head on my shoulders, take my love into you. Take it and cherish it, and feel it's warmth. Stare into my eyes, look into the future, see us together, get lost, be happy, run away with me.

      When I look deep inside myself, Its good to know you're out there, So when finally I come out- I can be with something beautiful.  The world can make me feel like crap, and it's not always the world's fault, But I'm glad you care anyways, You make me feel like things'll be okay.  When I try to look deep inside of you, I stop myself before I get too far, because I'd rather hear it, coming from that comforting voice of yours.  I'm thankful I met someone like you, I don't think anyone else could handle, the weird tendencies I get sometimes, but you seem to love me anyways.  I'll always be true to you, it's a small price to pay, for the amount of love you show me, Just know that I love you all the same.  You're the greatest baby, I can't imagine feeling like this, for anybody but you, You're my lover girl.

      I woke up one day, And I couldn't find 'em. I just couldn't believe, They were gone. They rolled off the bed... Down the stairs... and out the door. Never to be found again. Where did they go? I do not know. They left me for dead, How could they do such a thing? I felt lonely wihtout them, So I put up poster's, All around the town. Old ladies gave weird stares, But I was too worried, To even care. Weeks went by with no word, I was really getting worried, Until one day, I got a postcard, "Welcome to Fiji" it said, "Wish you were here!" And&nbsp;on the back it read... "Well, not really, better off w/o you" I was in awe, my jaw dropped, How they learned to write, Is a mystery to me. I guess they  were  better off, I really don't know, But I do know one thing, I will always treasure, That postcard from Fiji.   Weird? Ya. Don't ask me where it came from...

      Trust me, I know it all, I can see you sleep, I hear your thoughts, I'm in your brain. I know what you did, I saw it too, You can't get away, I'll always be here, To see and hear and know. I'm in your head, You know it too, I talk to you, But you don't listen. Grab ahold, I'll take you for a ride. So you know what it's like, To see it from my point of view. If you saw what I saw, You might not do it again, If you heard what I heard, Things could be different next time. Take a tip from me, What you think is right, Is far from true, How you got that way, I don't know, I tried to help, But you shut me out, Never to&nbsp;listen again. So as you wander on this planet, Doing what you do, I'll be watching, Wishing you would have listened, Just one time.

      Get your hands off of me,  You dirty bag of shat.  No one wants that from you,  You make me so sick.  Go take a shower,  Before you get near me.  Keep your distance,  I don't want to catch,  whatever it is you have.  You're a grab bag for diseases,  Take your pick,  You have 'em all,  So get the hell away from me,  You nasty dirty thing.  Circle, circle, dot, dot,  Get your ass away from me.  You lesioned dingleberry,  Run away you fool,  Nobody wants to be around you,  You dirty little girl.    It's short and mean, I know... It's just a joke though ;)

      All I want to do, Is be with you, All I want to feel, Is your hand in mine, All I want to hear, Is that you love me, Don't worry about the rest, It'll get taken care of. Right now... All I want... Is you. All I want to do, Is be by your side. All I want to feel, Is your warm embrace. All I want to hear, Is the beating of your heart. Don't worry about the rest, Leave it to someone else, It deosn't matter now. Right now... And always, All I want... And will ever want, Is you... And only you.

      The words in this thing, They hurt you deeply, They make you laugh, They perplex you. The words in this thing, They come from my head, They come from experience, They come out of inspiration. The words in this thing, They mean something else, Or maybe they don't, They can be confusing. The words in this thing, They show you love, They show you anguish, They show you something. The words in this thing, They can seem dumb, Or really intelligent, They drift from time to time. The words in this thing, Are just words, But they came from somewhere, So thats why they hurt, Or heal... Or love... The thing to know, Is that words don't and can't, Make a person who they are. And just because words are said, or written... or thought... You still have to see, That there is an emotion, Somewhere in there, No matter what the words say, Something else is there, and you have to find it, Somehow, someway, Try to look at the source.

      I look at my bed, And I have no idea, What to think, It's only a bed, But there is something, Something else, I see a symbol in it, Somehow, someway, Something in my life, Is connected to that bed. I think of why I use it, Sometimes to hide from the world, Sometimes because I'm tired, Sometimes because I have to. I think of what happens on it, I cry on it, I sleep on it, I'm joyous on it, I'm in love on it. I can't figure it out. It's not a normal bed, And it sort of represents me, But there's something else to it, That I can't quite grasp. Maybe there's a lesson in that, That I shouldn't read into things, As much as I tend to sometimes. But then I wouldn't be me, and that bed wouldn't be here.

      Time is going to take me, and pummel me to the ground. Time is going to grab me, and take me where I don't wanna go. Time is going to try me, and burden me to death. But time isn't going to take, The thing I care for the most. Time can't touch, The matters of the heart. Time can't drag my love through dirt, Like it can my face. Time can't beat my heart to a pulp, Like it can my body. Time can't erase that feeling I have, Like it can my memory. So I don't worry about time, Even though it changes me, Because time can't change, The thing I value most, Time will never take away, My love for you.

      No matter what you think, I'm always going to love you. I have to admit, Like I have many times before, You are the greatest thing, To ever happen to me. No matter what you say, I'm always going to love you. I must say, Even though you don't agree, You are one of (if not the), most beautiful girls I have seen. No matter where you go, I'm always going to love you. I've always thought, Each and every day, I'm always going to be, Right there by your side. No matter what happens, I'm always going to love you, I'll always have the memory, Of that beautiful girl, That gave me the world.

      If you want me to know you, Don't keep things from me. If you want me to love you, Don't put me in a corner. Because love doesn't hide, behind a mask. You're right to say, I wouldn't know, If you kept it from me. But I have to say, That if you did, I don't think you can easily say, That you love me. I want to hear, What you have to say, If it's good, then great; If it's bad, then fine; at least I know. I know you love me, So don't change now, Don't turn the light out on me. Because I'm no good to you, Unless I know. I'm just some other guy, Unless I know. You don't really need me, If you keep it from me, All you need is a friend. But I know you love me, and it is your choice, I just hope... You don't shut the door on me, Because I love you.

      I vaccum the floor  I clean my clothes  I change my sheets  Launder my comforters  I straighten up my bed  Because you're coming over  To mess it all up  I take a nice long shower  I use my special spray  I take care to shave  I fix my hair up right  becaue you're coming over  To mess it all up  But when I think on it  I could really care less  Because a messed up bed  or screwed up hair  Is a sign of something good  A sign you've been here  So I'm not going to complain  and I'll keep it up for now  Just so that one day  You might come on over  To mess it all up

      I stall...  And stall...  And stall...  Until the digits on the clock,  read: One triple zero.  I try to suck up time,  I start at Five  I might watch a movie,  or talk to my friends,  But I'm growing impatient,  Because that clock will not change.  Seven&nbsp;rolls in 4 hours late.  And time still crawls.  I put in my game,  And play it all night.  Getting annoyed at those digits  On my god-damn clock.  It never turns to ten,  Not when I want it.  So I sit and wait,  plotting all the while.  Nine&nbsp;comes in slow.  And by now I dunno,  What I'm gonna do.  So I grab a pad and pen,  and write what I can,  But I never get it right,  'Cause my mind is at ten.  So I sit there and stare,  At about nine-forty.  Holding in my hand,  My connection to you.  A few minutes early,  I dial all the digits,  All the ones, nines, and fours,  Hoping I can talk to you,  Just once more.    Doesn't quite flow... but w/e, I'm tired.

      Sometimes I get selfish, And wish I could forget, Some of the things I know. So I can deny it ever happened, And never take responsibility. Sometimes I think, "What if I wasn't there?" Somehow my not knowing things, Might make things better for you. But I'm only being selfish, 'Cause I hurt so much for you. I wish I could make things good, I wish I could take you away, I wish I could keep you happy, and when I know I can't... I think I want to forget, That anything ever happened. Then I realize what I've thought, And straighten myself out. Because I never want to forget you, Good or bad, I need to have you. If I didn't I'd be a lesser person. You brought me love, You made my dreams come true, You gave me the world. That's something I don't want to forget, Even if I hurt so much, To know that you aren't happy, And to know I can't do anything, I still don't want to forget, That I love you. It'd be selfish of me, to think otherwise. All I need to know, is&nbsp;that "I love you."

      I pray for you. I pray you'll grow some wings, To fly away from that place. Never to have to woory again. Never to know pain again. I pray for me. I pray I'll see you again, So I can make you happy, To give you a vacation, To show you what love is like. I pray for her. I pray she gets some sense, To understand what's wrong, Never to hurt you again, Never to make things awkward again. I&nbsp;pray for all these things. Hoping I can help you, In any way I can. So you'll never have to worry, and never have to be sad. I pray... and pray... and pray... But the day hasn't come, and I feel a hole inside myself, Beginning to grow, and eat away at my faith. But still I pray, and pray... and pray... Hoping for something, To shine down on you, and show you a better place.

      If you're mad at someone else, Then don't take it out on me. Don't act like you don't love me, When you know I've done no worng. Becaue You'll only hurt yourself, If you try and hurt me. I can tell by your voice, your tone isn't pleasant. But baby I didn't do anything, So don't try and tear me down. You know I'm here for you, that's a promise I'll never break. But baby please appreciate it, and don't take a shot at me. I didn't do this to you, So please don't hurt me. I love you with all my heart, I just want to make you happy. But that's not gonna happen, if you take things out on me. I know you don't mean it baby, But try and be more careful, You know I love you baby, Just keep that in mind.

      My little red binder Sits under the computer Waiting for my pen To write little notes to you It wants to know what I think It wants to be in my business But lately I've been slacking And I must say "I'm sorry..." "...I know how much you like to hear..." "...All the things I think of Jaime..." "...but today is not the day for you." And I know it's mad at me But the book will get over it Once I start writing again But, Until then I suffer the consequences of having that little red binder Stare at me with disconserting eyes And an evil straight-faced snarl That tells me I'm behind  &nbsp;  Weird poem eh? Dunno where that came from... More later, once I call Jaime.

      I don't want to wonder If this is a blunder I don't want to worry whether  We're gonna stay together 'Till we die  I don't want to jump in Unless this music's thumping All the dishes rattle in the cupboards When the elephants arrive  I want to love you madly I want to love you now I want to love you madly, way I want to love you, love you Love you madly  I don't want to fake it I just want to make it The ornaments look pretty But they're pulling down the branches Of the Tree  I don't want to think about it I don't want to talk about it When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom Of the sea  I want to love you madly I want to love you now, yeah I want to love you madly, way I want to love you, love you Love you madly  I don't want to hold back I don't want to slip down I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I  Should have done  I don't want to doubt you Know everything about you I don't want to sit across the table from you  Wishing I could run  I want to love you madly I want to love you now I want to love you madly, way I want to love you, love you Love you madly

      The winds blow from the east Warmth comes from the west I can't walk this way anymore The weather has gotten harsh I can't say I didn't see it coming But I ignored it just as well The north is too frigid  I've been there before The east hasn't done me good It's time for me to go south I'm not sure what I'll find So I think I'll take a detour Southwest sounds about right 'Cause at least I'll find warmth Travelling through this strange place But the more I move the more I learn If things go right I'll have a sound mind If they don't I'll be off somewhere again Looking for me... Let's hope I don't take a wrong turn.   And no it is not about the weather... You have to read into it a bit deeper than that. This one is a bit easier to get than some of my other one's that have deeper things in them. If you have a question ask.

      The storm clouds roll in, The air begins to chill, The first punch is thrown. Rain falls in an instant, Water weighs down your clothes, Everything moves in slow motion. Lightning strikes, An arrow through the heart, Red ooze on the ground, Washed away by the downpour. The power goes out, That smile of yours is gone. Thunder rages on and on, Words exchanged in anger, Like shots from a gun, Muffled by the sound of crackling, None of us wanted this. I fall to the ground, Throw my hands up, Pray for something better. Hail begins to fall, We realized what we've done, And it's hurt us both. The rain is all but gone. Wipe those tears away. Put your arms around me. Tell me you love me. The clouds fade away, I look for a rainbow, There is none to be found. But the sun moves across the sky, Radiating warmth upon the earth, Creating wisps of fog, To help us forget the pain, And move on to better things.

      Well, seeing as I already have three websites, two being blogs, one being a geocities site. This is an experiment of mine, and if doesn't work out then I'll have to give it up. I have two people that I want to have as writers, just to do whatever. My plan is to have this be a centralized communication hub between my closer friends, so as long as they don't bow out I might have something going. Needless to say, the template will be going through some massive changes while I get everything ready. Lets hope this works. More later...

      From my point of view forever is a weird thing, especially when it comes to relationships. At my age (16) I'm told that thinking about forever with someone is crazy and I really shouldn't think that way. But my mind-set is that if I'm going to invest such a huge amount of love into someone why is it impossible to think about forever? It's not like it hasn't happened before, my grandmother got hitched at 16. I'm not saying I'm about to propose at the age of 16, but I kinda would like to when I turn 18...  But then again that all depends Jaime, so I'm thinking I have to wait awhile before I should even try because she wants to wait (or something to that effect anyway). Back to the point though, if you are truly, deeply in love with someone then why should you be barred from thinking about forever? Some people are scared about forever though, they think they are missing out on the rest of the world. I don't see it that way... When I think of it I think "Wow, I get to go out and do what I want to do and always be able to have this incredible person at my side." Just because you are together doesn't mean you have to settle down, it's not impossible to live a rich and experienced life while at the same time being young and hitched. My problem is that I think it's no use to be so in love with someone and then think, "Well, I'm not going to be with this person forever, there will be others," I suddenly lose the point of being in love. If you are in love with someone I think that the mind-set would be that you're going to be together forever... Otherwise it just seems like lust. And if it's lust then there is no use putting you're heart into it, you'll only end up hurting it. So what I'm trying to say is that if you are completely in love with someone then forever is a given (even if it doesn't last forever, that's why your heart breaks), and you shouldn't be frowned upon for think that way, as long as you know what love is. And if you think you are in love but your mind isn't set on forever, then you might want to look at your relationship and think about whether it is love or lust. Then again I'm not Dr. Phil and I could be wrong, it's all just opinion.

         urlLink       Take the  urlLink Spirit Quiz  and visit  urlLink Castle Diqueria .    The first time around I got "empty spirit." Didn't seem quite right to me, so I changed an answer that confused me and got this one. Still doesn't seem quite right, maybe I'm just different or something. Quite a short quiz really.

      Normally, when someone sees a problem in a system, they recognize it and rid the system of the problem. But what happens when a person finds a problem within themselves? When they’ve finally gone through the agony of looking back at themselves and discover a problem, what do they do? I guess it would depend on the problem, and the person. For example, if someone were to figure out that they have a drug addiction then they might commit themselves to a rehab center, but if another person were to discover that they were compulsive liars, they might just continue on with their issues, possibly feeling guilty, but nonetheless continuing.   Reason I bring it up is because I have my own problems, and I full well acknowledge them, but I haven’t changed every one of them. I used to have problems with abusing the internet for various reasons and I changed my ways, finally growing up and seeing that what I was doing was wrong and immoral. So in that instance I’ve changed. But in others, with a lot of my other problems such as: not speaking up, holding back emotions, not watching my words (such as “whatever”), and there are more I may touch on later.   With the first, not speaking up, I have a strange dilemma with, well, it may not be strange but it is a dilemma either way. So far, it has not put a huge dent on my life, there have been times where if I had spoken up I may have succeeded in something I otherwise took the back seat in, or it just plain would have been better had I said something, or said it louder. There was one situation where I could have missed out on the love of my life, but due to the incredible friends I have been so graciously gifted with, all was not lost and I get to share my heart with the most incredible person in the world, something I thought might not ever happen. But other than the prior mention issues, I have not had huge consequences on my inability to speak up, therefore I have not tried to change it. Lately though I have been coming to the grave realization that if this does not change I will not be able to move into adult life correctly. I can run a business, and have it be the most successful one in the world, I’ve somewhat proven that in my journalism work, but the problem is getting there. In school, you can become acknowledged in basically one of two ways, through being loud about yourself, or by being recognized for diligence. My situation is the latter, I got where I am through what I have done, and it should work that way throughout the world, but unfortunately it does not. In the real world I have to network, talk to the right people, make the right connections, or else I’m going no where. If I can’t make contacts and just rely on my workmanship, I won’t get where I want to be. Sure people would recognize me for being a workhorse, but I’ll still be sitting at the bottom. Speaking up and voicing what I see and think along with my track record of good work is what will put me on top, I just have to learn to do it. I’m trying desperately to grow up and overcome this issue, and only time will tell whether or not I am able to face the change.  With the second problem, holding back emotions, it’s been more urgent to overcome, but I have pretty much done so. There is a ‘but’ though, I have only been able to do it because of the person I’m in love with. I’ve always felt like I was sensitive, but I haven’t always shown it. Recently I have become more upfront about what it is I’m feeling, in some ways anyway, I can honestly say that I whole heartedly try not to hold back what it is I’m feeling when someone asks if there is something wrong with me. Sometimes though I still keep it to myself, maybe because it is for the better, or the situation isn’t right for expelling emotions, or I’m just being stoic. It’s not always good for me to hold back though, because it hurts others that might want to help and creates a whole other problem worse than what you started out with. I’m still unsure of what exactly I should do with this situation, but all I know is that I want to be more open and I’m trying to do so every new day.  When it comes to watching my words, I need to do just that, watch them. Far too many times for my taste have I blurted out a ‘whatever’ when I completely did not mean to. I try to make use of an extensive vocabulary, but when I get tired it all just goes down hill. Especially when I’m full up on emotions, I don’t care what words I use, I just use them and only I know what I am saying, leaving the rest of the world out there hanging trying to figure out what it is I meant. And it usually turns out in ways I never meant it to. It’s something I continue to work on, I’m better than I used to be, but not perfect.  So being a human being myself, I would guess that everyone else goes through the same process. You see a problem, see where it has hurt you, or where it hasn’t, and form that point you decide whether, subconsciously or otherwise, that you’re going to either change or leave yourself be. It would be easier if we could all just treat ourselves like a system and get rid of whatever problem we have, but as humans it is more difficult because we complicate the issues; it’s too hard for us to accept such sudden change. Point is we can change, it is in our nature, we just have to be able to acknowledge our problems and tackle them head on.   **By writing this I am in no way asserting that I know something you all do not, I am simply going through a thought process and putting it in writing so that I may be able to look back on it and gather new knowledge from seeing my thoughts laid out in print form. My reasoning for posting this is that it takes a bit of a deeper look at myself than my other writing normally does, so therefore it ends up on Logos & Amor rather than elsewhere.

      Well, I'm just about finished fiddling around with the template, I'm still looking for some extra little things to put into it. Stuff will probably accumulate over time. I think I may have gotten myself one writer, Katie. We'll see how things go.  My game-plan for this blog, since I have two others (FlamingPinkFlamingo, which is about my personal life, and HereticLounge, which basically has all my literary crap on it), is to take different aspects of my life and write extensively about them, kinda like looking back on yourself and analyzing; for example, looking at a song I like and examining why it is it could possibly appeal to me. If that doesn't work out I have to find something else, I don't want to just have another FlamingPinkFlamingo, that would suck, so this blog will be personal, but from a different aspect. Also, it'll probably be updated on more of a weekly rather than daily basis, so that I can have a quality output.  And I would certainly hope anybody who comes on board with me would kinda try and do the same thing. "United we stand, divided we fall," having conflicting genres of writing would just create chaos as to what exactly one would expect form the site, in short: I don't want to confuse the hell outta people and have them leave and never come back.  I want my Jaime to write too, but I somehow doubt she will, maybe I could talk her into it, but then again, if she don't want to do it, she don't have to, I'm not going to force her into anything. I'll take other writers though, whomever is willing to write can go right on ahead with it.   I suppose the next thing I will post will be a list of things about "James" o0o0o0o, interesting... not! Then I guess whenever Katie joins up she can fill out the same list about herself, just for starters.  Ciao

      First, you must learn to pronounce the city name. It is Bawl-a-mer, or Ball-tee-more, depending on if you live North or South of Route 40.  Next, if your road map is more than a few weeks old, throw it out and buy a new one. If near Howard County and your map is one day old, it is already obsolete.  On Monday, you don't wash your clothes, you warsh them. Before you eat a meal, you don't wash your hands, you warsh them in the zink with wudder.  Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Baltimore has its own version of traffic rules... "Hold on and pray." There is no such thing as a dangerous high-speed chase in Baltimore. We all drive like that.  All directions start with "The Beltway"...which has no beginning and no end, just one continuous loop that locals believe is somehow clarified by an "inner" and an "outer" designation, raising comparisons of the beltway being the big belly-button of the city.  The morning rush hour is from 6 to 11. The evening rush hour is from 1 to 7. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday morning.  If there is a ballgame at either stadium, there is no point inattempting to go anywhere south of downtown until the following day.  If you actually stop at a yellow light, you will be rear-ended, cussed out and possibly shot. However, when you are the first one in line at a red light, count to five when the light turns green before proceeding to avoid being T-boned by all five of the drivers running the red light in cross-traffic. (However, if you don't go as soon as it turns green, you get the horn.)  Precipitation causes an immediate 50 point drop in IQ in all otherdrivers on the road. Winter precipitation causes an immediate 100 point drop in IQ.  Construction on I-97 is a way of life and a permanent form ofentertainment. Interesting that it's called "an Interstate," but runs only from the Beltway to Annapolis. Opening in 1992, it has been torn up and under re-construction ever since.  All unexplained sights are explained by the phrase, "Oh, we're in GLIMBURNIE! (Glen Burnie)"  If someone actually has their turn signal on, it is probably a factory defect.  Car horns are actually "Road Rage" indicators.  All old ladies with blue hair in Buicks have the right of way. Period. Even if they are in the left lane of I-97 oblivious to the fact that the speed limit is 65 and not 55.  All roads mysteriously change their names as you cross intersections.  A trip across town (north to south) will take a minimum of four hours, although the tunnel does have, on occasion, more than one lane open,but never on holiday weekends.  The minimum acceptable speed on the Beltway is 85. Anything less isconsidered downright sissy.  The Beltway is our daily version of NASCAR.  The open lane for passing on all Maryland interstates is the far right lane because no self-respecting Maryland driver would ever be caught driving in the "slow" lane...no matter how slowly they are driving (see blue haired old ladies above).  The far left lanes on all Maryland interstates are official "chat"lanes reserved for drivers who wish to talk on their cellphones. All mini-vans, particularly if filled with children, also have priority clearance to use the far left lane at whatever speed the driver feels most comfortable multi-tasking in.  If it's 10 degrees, it's the Orioles' opening day. If it's 110 degrees,it's opening day at the Ravens Stadium.  If the humidity is 98+ and the temperature is 98+, it's May, June, July, August, September, and sometimes October.  If you go to a football game, pay the $75.00 to park in the "Ravens Lot." Parking elsewhere could cost up to $7,500 for damages, towing fees, parking tickets, etc.  If some guy with a flag tries to get you to park in his yard during Preakness, run over him. It's probably not his yard, anyway.

      All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow, no tomorrow And I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very mad world mad world Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me, no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson Look right through me, look right through me And I find it kinda funnyI find it kinda sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever hadI find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very mad world ... world Enlarge your world Mad world

       Yea I know this is on two sites...   As far as people go I think I’m a normal one. Introspective, and reclusive yes, but not tot the point where my world isn’t right. I have many skills that I’ve learned in school or taught my self such as writing, programming, and working with electronics and so on. Though I have these skills I’m missing out on one that many consider important: I am not the world’s greatest conversationalist. I have many people who can attest to that. But most of the people I know have been able to get past it and accept the fact that I’m one quiet bugger. When it comes to figuring out why I’m quiet I can come up with a couple of answers. For one, I normally never talk much unless I’m ecstatic, if I’m just content then I’m not worried about talking I’m just happy with what I’m doing at that moment. Two,&nbsp; I grew up with people who made me feel dumb when I talked (not my mother it was more my father and grandmother) so I keep to myself unless I’m absolutely sure of what I’m about to say… I’m kind of touchy about that. Three, I really feel like most people could give less than a crap about what I have to say so I just plain keep to myself. That’s not to say I don’t enjoy talking, I have as much fun socializing as any other average Joe/Jane does and with the right topic I could talk someone’s ear off, but I’m not going to be the one that starts the conversation, not usually anyway. And as I said before most people can deal with that, but some do have their problems. And it’s those few who have the greatest effect on me for some odd reason. It makes me feel like there is really something wrong with me and that I belong on pills like Prozac or Zoloft. Of course, that in turn makes me even more quiet, and makes me feel even more awkward around the person because now I feel like I’m expected to talk but I can’t come up with anything since I’m too worried about offending them. I’ve wondered whether or not some kind of prescription would help, but as my mother said, I am who I am because of the way I was raised and what I’ve been through, and to come out of it okay is a feat so if part of growing up caused me to be a bit quieter there’s no problem because I’ve excelled everywhere else in life. I wasn’t being conceited just a second ago, that’s what I was told, and I was conveying it to the reader. There are problems, obviously, associated with not speaking up all the time… I’ve lost a girlfriend because of it (not to say I really care anymore, but it happened), I’ve had familial trouble because of it, people have thought the wrong things about me because of it, and as I grow closer to being in the business world I could have trouble networking (but I have a rebuttal on that last part… and here it is:&nbsp; ) Though networking could be a problem I have noticed in my journalism experience that when it comes down to doing business my conservative speech helps out quite a bit. People realize that I cut out all the crap and get right down to what needs to be done, and then they look to me to help out, and I know one person in particular who could attest to it, she’s seen me balance the newspaper budget, schedule advance fundraisers, work with the Washington post, and get a group of people on track with what has to be done. But I’m guessing that my business attitude is detrimental to my personal life… which brings me to my next little thing. As far as my personal life goes… with my non-talkative nature I don’t really take too well to groups, I’m more of a person who is better with ‘intense’ one on one relationships. I do much better with just one person then I do with many… unless of course that person has made me uncomfortable, then all bets are off. And overall I just don’t feel the need to talk, I enjoy just being with people and sharing the experience… talking isn’t on the top of my to-do list. So in the end my quirk is bittersweet… sometimes a tad bitter than sweet, but hey, everyone’s got their issues, I’m sure I’m not the worst… even though people seem to make me feel that way some of the time. I’ll get back to ya in 84 years to tell ya whether how I acted was right or wrong, but by then it probably won’t matter that much now will it?

      I haven't been able to come up with a topic to write on yet so obviously there have been no posts. I'll take suggestions... anywho, I was alos thinking that this is probably a pretty boring site to most of the people who even look at it s so I was thinking of abandoning it. There's only been 100 visitors and probably of that hundred 1/3 of it is me visiting from different locations. I'm gonna think on it for awhile then I'll do what I think is right.

And after all You're my wonderwall  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me ?
