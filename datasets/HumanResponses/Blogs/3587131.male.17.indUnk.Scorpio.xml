      摄氏三十五度 我不再回顾 想你在他的怀里  应该幸福 我该祝福 冷得我想哭 不能哭   傻到什么程度 我心里有数 最后一口啤酒无所谓  酸或苦 能笑着送你走 就满足 很满足   看着天上乌云 满满 排山倒海 这夏季第一场雨  迎面而来 当结局不能改 我又何必躲开  没什么值得大惊小怪 就淋个痛快   听风 咻-咻-咻-嘲笑我的爱 就像感情的备胎  只在旁边喝采  你别问why why why 我一直都在  你有很好的未来 再痛我也说all right   当风 咻-咻-咻-送走我的爱 街边路灯一整排  低着头为谁默哀   是天在 cry cry cry 我的笑还在  有天他不能依赖 你怀念我外套口袋  告诉我 我随时 stand by

      Hiding from the rain and snow Trying to forget but I won't let go Looking at a crowded street Listening to my own heart beat  So many people all around the world Tell me where do I find someone like you girl  (Chorus) Take me to your heart take me to your soul Give me your hand before I'm old Show me what love is - haven't got a clue Show me that wonders can be true  They say nothing lasts forever We're only here today Love is now or never Bring me far away  Take me to your heart take me to your soul Give me your hand and hold me Show me what love is - be my guiding star It's easy take me to your heart  Standing on a mountain high Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky I should go and see some friends But they don't really comprehend  Don't need too much talking without saying anything All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing (Chorus)

      妖精在我的鼻子前跳着舞 失血过多的我眼睛变模糊  杀气粉碎了喉咙惨烈音符 下一刻 又复活   重复循环着没人问为什么 独自奔跑在森林中的寂寞  遥远的打斗声被抛在脑后 你砍我 我就报复   chorus: 我目睹的一切 真实的存在这个世界  是心灵的残缺 还是现实已 被忽略   虚拟的善恶战 落在另外一个天堂  我在其中迷惘了悲伤 魔血喷出飞溅   虚拟的善恶战 回到现实中也一样  就算活在天堂 依是悲伤   黑暗势力炫耀死亡结果 光明精灵散发除魔的洒脱  现代人每秒思绪里的斟酌 在狂燃 是战火   他们撕裂空间肉眼看不见 只剩战斗后的一切飞上天  银色的外衣染上敌人鲜血 剑锋却不懂停歇   Repeat chorus  Rap： You think it's perfect Everything is so fine  Wait till you look it through your Spiritual eyes   You think it's nice But please open your eyes  This place is but a Beautiful STY   You want it I want it Everything's a want  We lose it then we say it’s For FUN   You think it's funny What I'm saying is corny  It's a warning Heed it or IGNORE it

      The truth is tearing up my heart I can't recognize this place The endless road without a stop sign Can't even find a stranger this time Why am i still holding back my tears  In this loneliness there's nothing to fear Every chord still seems a wonder How we could be together  Every time i ask if this would be the last Why am i still talking to myself Hoping you will have the keys to my cell Every song might calm the weather but it just draws me deeper  How do i get out of this I think i never will A crystal forming in the eye Maybe this would be the last The winding path down my face Till i begin to taste the bitterness inside   by 林俊杰

      喝纯白的豆浆 是纯白的浪漫 望着你 可爱脸蛋 和你纯真的模样 我傻傻对你笑 是你忧愁解药 你说我 就像油条 很简单却很美好 我知道 你和我就像是豆浆油条 要一起 吃下去 味道才会是最好 你需要我的傻笑 我需要你的拥抱 爱情就是要这样它才不会淡掉 我知道 有时候 也需要吵吵闹闹 但始终 也知道 只有你对我最好 豆浆离不开油条 让我爱你爱到老 爱情就是要这样它才幸福美好 我知道 都知道 你知道 你都知道 好不好  别偷笑 笑 让我知道(就好) 我喝完热豆浆 却念着还想要 你吃完金黄 油条 爱情又要再发酵    By 林俊杰

      说也奇怪 这些年来 不明白 我如何 忍受过来 一场期待 一片空白 人的心 就是这样狠起来 我们的恋爱 如果不失败 我们怎幺会有这幺成功的分开 Never mind you just go away 你以为 我一定后悔 已经有了 最坏的准备 走了这步 就举手不回 Never mind you just go away 你以为 我就会流泪 我会不会(如果我不会) 你配不配(你会不会) 免强相爱 就像骨牌 守不住 倒不如 倒的精采 lt's okay l'm okay 我不用你陪 你不要误会 我只是有点累 却没时间崩溃

      Jun &amp; Jen were a pair of young couple...Jun was veri charming &amp; many girls could`t helpfalling in love with him... therefore, he became quite a flirt.As for Jen, she was an ordinary girl with average looks. Although there were quite a number of guys chasing her, jenonly had Jun in her heart.altought She knew that one day Jun would eventually leave her ..she still continued to love him whole heartedly...Jen loves rainy days...she loves playing in the rain, &amp; whenever Jun wanted to join her, she'll always stop him from joinin.Jun then ask her; Why don't you let me join you?Jen replied;Err..er..because i don't want you to fall sick.Jun then ask her again;If playing in the rain will make me fall sick, then why are you still doing it?But each time Jen will always keep quiet &amp; smile at him...Although Jun was`t able to join her, he felt happy. To him, as long as Jen was happy, he'll be happy as well. :)However, nothin last long... Jun soon fell for another girl after two months. He even love the girl more deeply den he love jen One day, while Jun &amp; Jen were having their dinner , Jun told Jen that this would be their last dinnertogether... Jen looked at him. She knew dat this was going to happen, but she choose not to ask any farther...Jun then requested for a break up.. And Jen...she accepted willingly... partly because, she knew...Jun was just like the wind...never stop at any point.That night..it was to be the last time Jun send Jen home.. Jen kept veri quiet...although deep down she wanted to know the reasons but she choose not to ask. Just when Jen was about to step into the lift, Jun stop her. He said;Jen, I'm really sorry that i've let you down. But i'll never forget those days when i see you playing in the rain...those are the most happy &amp; unforgottable memories i had with you After listening to Jun, Jen could't help it but cried..Jun hugged her tightly. He said:Jen, There's one question i wanted to ask you long ago... Why is it everytime when you are playing in the rain, you just would`t allow me to accompany you?Jen was stunned..pausing 4 a few seconds,Jen replied...Because...Because i don't wish to let you know...I'm was crying
