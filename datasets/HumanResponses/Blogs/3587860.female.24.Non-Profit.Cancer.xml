						   Hello ALL. So this is Congo 2004 and 2005 as well, but its just too long to have both years in there. Lets see. today is the 10th of june.  Just a few days ago the army of the DRC came into Bukavu and all the rebels left without a fight, so things are looking good for now. As long as things dont get bad again I am scheduled to leave on the 8th of September.  My training in England will be the 16-25th of july.  Until then I am still here in the french alps. current temp 27.3 Celicus. so its nice and warm, not humid though.  I will soon be getting in touch with everyone about the start of my fundraising for this missions trip.  I will need about 7,000 US Dollars to get me through a year.  This will cover my airfare, transportation, VISAs, and food as well as some money for programing.  Since I will be working with street children, they will not have very many possessions and I will be doing my best within the church to improve their lives.  Interested in more...email me at whiteafrican01@yahoo.com and put CONGO in the message title so i know its not juke mail.  have a blessed day sarah beckstrom

						   well, i have less than two weeks left in france.  the year has gone by quickly and i will soon be saying goodbye to all my friends.  when i first came to france it was to learn the language to aid me in Congo, but i have learned much more than the language.  i have learned from the people, the land the culture. i have listened to the winds in the mountains and the sound of a pine cone, poping as it is opening up for the first time.  it has been a year of preparation for the road that is set before me.  In two weeks time i will be in england for my training course with CMS.  Pray for a time of openness and growth.  God is going to do mighty things!

						   Greetings my friends,  I am writing with exciting news.  God is good!  And He has opened a door for me, but in order for me to walk through it, I need your help.  Why do you need our help to walk through a door? I need your help because I am just a small part of the body.  Without prayers, encouragment and support from the body of Christ I can do nothing.  So what exactly is this door? I have been accepted into a one year program called MAD, Make A Difference.  MAD is part of a mission agency working in partnership with churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  It is called CMS, Church Mission Society. http://www.cms-uk.org/.  CMS will be sending me to the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire.  I will be in a town on the border of Rwanda, called Bukavu.  I will be working under the local church and two of their ministries.  One ministry is aimed at street children and the other at women and young girls who are rape vicitums.  Both of these groups have been greatly affected by years of war and fighting.  Are you sure you are ready for this door? Is it even safe? This is a door I have been waiting and praying for.  God has put Congo on my heart and as heavy as it is, I am filled with anticipation and excitment to see what God will do.  I do know that there has been a lot of trouble in the area in the past years, but this just means the people are that much more in need.  As for my safety, CMS would not allow me there unless they thought it was safe.  If the situation were to change for the worse, they would have me moved to a safer location.  So where do we come in? I need your help in many ways.  First of all, I need your encouragement.  I feel God is calling me to Africa. I need to know that it is not just a thought in my head, but that you also believe that God wants me there.  I need to hear your thoughts and concerns.  As a single part of the body of Christ, I can not move unless the rest of the body is willing to move me. The next important thing I need is your prayers.  Life can be really tough in Congo, espicially while working with people who have suffered so much.  The simple daily things in life can often become a challenge.  I need your prayers of support, guidance, and safety.  Pray for me during my time of training in England (15-25 July), my days of traveling (second week of September) and my days of adjustment, as well as for ease of communication (I will have to use only French and Kiswahili). I also need your finiancial support.  Although CMS provides me with a roof over my head they do ask that I raise support for everything else.  I have a budget of $11,000 for 1 year in Congo.  This will cover everything from my transportation to my bread and butter, as well as leave some extra for some programing.  I am trusting that God will keep all these things on your heart and that you will remember me throughout the year.
