I felt so confused... about my 5 friends...i treat them as my friends(4 good friends + 1 best friend)but i felt that they treat me like an outsider.At night i would sometimes keep thinking and thinking.In the end,Wo beng kui le and cry until i fell asleep...Dunno wat to do ??? Is anybody there who can help me??? No,i don think so ... only the 5 friends are able to help me...   The helpless soul...

      Haha!!!  Camp was so fun,my spirit now is still like i am still at the camp but it needs alot of risk-taking.I was so scared,the adventures there was very high,'at least' 11 storeys.In the end,i completed all the challenges there ,actually i was afraid to go up the challenges but all the girls in my team want to go up so i also go out.i thought i would drop down and die i completed.  Felt so happy for myself.I was so relieved now that i have tried because this kind of things is like once in a lifetime,u do not always have the chance to try u noe???  After the camp,i felt that i have learnt alot through the camp.Now,i know where are my goals and what i must do to achieve them.For example:         1st:Take more initiative to volunteer.         2nd:Trust all my friends wholeheartedly so that they will                also put their trust in me.         3rd:Improve my friendship with all my friends to the fullest               and work well with my friends.  Hope all my friends can see my sincerity in improving myself especially *** and some others...

      I was so frustrated today that i cried...I have done alot of the racial harmony project given by miss abey but was asked to do another project and give this one up...  Why?Why must she do that to me...  Actually,I m not angry...I am just frustrated...So in the end, i refused to talk---even to my mother and father...She called,I also refused to talk until 9pm...  I have not done any homework that needs to be pass up tomorrow and i still have to do the project...  If "she" is to reply or comment, pls do it at the *** website...  Once again,I am not angry, just frustrated...

            The difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives actively,while everyone else is created by their lives,passively waiting to see where takes them next.The differnce between the two is the difference between living fully and just existing.
