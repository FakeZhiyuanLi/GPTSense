       Hey, everyone! I made this journal so I could put posts up on my sister's Blog, which is basically a shrine to her baby, (Christian) Nick. My day at school was pretty good. Everything is so busy---sometimes stressful---at this time of year. Signing yearbooks, planning summer excursions, cramming for finals, saying goodbye to friends who are going away for the summer, etcetera. Also, this is your last chance at doing something in middle school...once we get to high school, the bits run up. If you have one last thing you have to do, someone you need to make amends with, a teacher you want to thank, a boy you want to confess your love to (not in my particular case, but for a lot of my friends)--well then now's the time. High school will be a whole new ball game!  I'm excited for ~**Summer 2004**~  Hope to see all of you, have a lot of time to hang out, and mostly... NOT BE GROUNDED!!   Gimme a call everyone!  728-1361   **Keely**

       (Verse 1] It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby I ain't happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Bridge] I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)   Some of the lyrics to Usher's "Burn" that remind me of someone....movin' on :) I'm so ready for summer and high school and I'll never have to see him again!  **Keely**

       I just read a great book,  tuesdays with Morrie  It was amazing! I spent my entire morning just reading it. It made me cry, and rethink a lot of stuff in my life... Soccer tonight...I'm excited...I hope our winning streak holds out...if not, I'll be kinda cranky, since I'm sacrificing a lot of time on soccer this season....almost every day!   Love, Keely

        Cause these are the days worth living, these are the years we're given, and these are the moments. These are the times. Let's make the best out of our lives...    We won the game last night : 2-0!! It was awesome! We are 6-2-1!!!!  Today was OK. I had an orthodontist appointment and got red bands...WOOHOO!!....jk. Then my sister took me to Canal Park and we went to Caribou Coffee and the candy store and got lots of goodies. It was nice...I went to Billy's brother's b-day party today, too. More food! LOL, I have eaten a lot today... My day was kinda boring....I have a soccer game tommorow. I hope we win! And I hope I do something fun soon!! REALLY F-ING BORING IN THE STIX, EH?!

       These are the lyrics to "Last Summer" and they make me sorta sad...I miss last summer...this one is good, too...but it can never be the same.  The Friday sun bears down again  As we drive without friends  And on these longest days we spend  All the time trying to pretend  That our stories could be true  Our chance to be cool  The setting down says the day is through  If only we knew...  And we all sit around here in our home town  Listen to the waves as they all crash down  And watch the fire as it slowly burns away  Glowing embers lie across the sky   Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer  The world passes by in my summer, our last summer  The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other  Alive to watch it all, the view from our last summer  The view from our last summer...  We trace the sun across the sky   And we laugh till we cry  Always so hard to say goodbye (good bye)  And we all sit round here in our home town  It's so good like this, these are times we'll miss  The memories, I hope they'll never fade Glowing embers lie across the sky   Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer  The world passes by in my summer, our last summer  The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other  Alive to watch it all, the view through our last summer  The view from our last summer...   I would stop time to stay with you  I would stop time so we don't move  I would stop time  I would stop time  I would stop time to keep you   Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer  The world passes by in my summer, our last summer  The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other  Alive to watch it all, the view from our last summer   Love ,  Keely

       Hey, my day has been pretty boring...I have a soccer game in Fridley tonight and I'm riding down with Lucia Goin, a really nice girl on my soccer team.

The crazy things teenagers go through! lol...I'm done... More later!  Love ,  Keely

       ...and the tender warmth inside is released into my life..." ~Firefly, Saves the Day  Hey! Last night was really nice...I talked to Nikita and Phil on the phone for like 3-4 hours, lol. And it made me really happy to talk to Nikita again, and we made plans for Wednesday. I've missed her  so much  this summer, even tho I  love  the rest of my friends!! But I'm really glad I made plans with Kita again...oh, and also last night, my mom got a turtle and we let it free in the swampy area on our land and soon we're gonna have lots of turtles...they're really ugly, so I'm not super excited about that...lol, oh well! Tonight I have a soccer game @ Jean Duluth..I'm so glad it's not in the Cities today. I'm sooooo not up to riding in a car for like 6 hours tonight...thank God it's a home game...I hope the coach isn't mad b/c I missed 2 practices b/c my mom was out of town and I had to stay @ Leah's all weekend so I wouldn't get kidnapped or something (says my mom). Well, I gotta go, but more after my soccer game, or maybe tomorrow....hugs and kisses to you all...   LOVE ,  Keely

       I hung out with Leah Rogotzke all weekend. It was great fun :) .....we hung out w/some Woodland girls, volunteered 4 Grandma's marathon, and went to "Mean Girls." I loved that movie! It was a great weekend. Then today, I've been a bit lazy and tired, but I did clean my room. Everything is perfectly neat except under the bed, which I'm gonna tackle later, and even that's not so bad.......  LOVE ,  Keely

       Last night was pretty  awesome!  I hung out with Grethell and Britt and it was fun. I slept at Grethell's and Neil and Cody stopped by. It was pretty fun, I must say, except for some of it, lol, but I bet that it's those times that I'll remember....I'm making memories!! Tonight I'm hanging out with Leah Rogotzke, too.  Love ,  Keely

       I felt sick this morning so I didn't go to soccer practice....my knee really hurts from last night's game. Feeling sick and tired and sorry for myself, but I'll pick it up. I couldn't sleep last night either...stayed up until 5 AM for some reason. Hopefully I'll shake off this weird feeling...I hope I'm not getting sick. Today, I sent out a Father's Day card to my dad...it felt weird addressing it to a Correction's Facility...sad. Then my sister, Leah, took me to the mall with her baby. I love those two!! Well....I guess I should go make something of my day, rather then sit on-line feeling sorry for myself!!   LOVE ,  Keely

He's a really cool kid; he's awesome! Well, I G2G...more tomorrow on the not-so-exciting life of me! Love,  Keely   ....what the heck am i doing....

       Wow...I had Amanda Smerz over today after soccer practice (which was fun, btw) and it was crazy! We were laughing  the whole time!  And we picked lilacs for my mom and we kept walking past Joe Serre's house to get them, and we were all trying to get a glimpse of him, and he dirtbiked past us and said: "Wow, so you've walked past here like 8 times..." and didn't believe that it was to get lilacs.....AHHH he's really cute and I might just have a crush on him....THEN I BROKE A FENCE! It was hilarious....I hope I don't get caught! Haha, well, more tomorrow.... Love,  Keely

       Today, I slept in, and then cleaned my room partially after taking a shower, and then Kalsie called and she wanted me to go to old-guy Bob's house with Lisa and her. Mom drove me there, and Megan was there, too, and we all hung out awhile. Christine stopped by, too. Then my sister Leah picked me up and drove me home, and I talked on the phone and on-line. So far my day has been a little boring, hopefully it picks up. Love,  Keely

       Hey! My weekend was pretty good. My mom and I drove down on Friday night and it was stormy, and we got there and I found a lot of girls on my soccer team. We all got in our bikinis and hung out at the pool and met some guys that were at a State Track Meet. They were really hot, with ripped stomach muscles, and prolly 16 or 17. We saw them again later, and everyone was playing it all cool as we flirted with them, and I had to be dumb and blurt out, "Why is your shirt on?!" I'm just too cool.... On Saturday, we lost two games which sucked cuz the teams we palyed weren't good, but we were missing people and dying from the heat, lol...anyways, then my mom took me shopping and I got lipgloss and perfume from Bath and Body Works, 5 thongs @ Victoria's Secret, a pair of capris and a belt from Abercrombie, a button-up white striped shirt from American Eagle, and two books: Wicked and Falling Angels. Then, that night we all met some guys our age who had a b-ball tourney. They were from Lacrosse, Wisconsin, and they were nice. We got there screen-names and Breanna, Amanda, Emily G., Christine, and I went to their room and watched 50 First Dates with them. It was fun. Then today, we checked out of the hotel, and my mom and I did a little more shopping and I got a tank top. Then my mom and I went to the movie, "Saved!" It was funny, about a school of Jesus-freaks and the main character, Jena Malone, gets pregnant, and Mandy Moore makes her life hell. Then we had a soccer game and I played forward and I scored the first goal of the tourney, and then made an assist with Kayley Malban for the second/last goal. Winning that game got us third place in the tourney and we got these big, gaudy medals...then my mom and I drove home and here I am!! Love, Keely

I haven't hung out with any of my friends other then my soccer friends much, but I did hang out with Austin and my neighbor/friend, Joe Serre. He's a cool kid, and it's fun to have a friend close by. He's a cutie, too. Well, I gotta go! More when I get home from the Cities...   **Keely**
