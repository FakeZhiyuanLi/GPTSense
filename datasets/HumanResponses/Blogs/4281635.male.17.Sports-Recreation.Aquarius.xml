      This has been such an uneventful day. I'm not even going to bother updating this tonight.  But since i'm here....  Today's main event was changing my Duvet cover. That was the first problem, duvet covers are luggage, all you need is a Duvet. Same goes for Pillows. I spent the rest of the day playing "Low" by Foo Fighters on the guitar. I'm not very good.  Jeepers Creepers was crap last night, not very impressive. I didn't watch all of it, but that little bit i did see was enough. Blues Brothers, theres a good film. At least Jeepers Creepers was followed by "Borats Television Programme" which was sheer entertainment.  That's pretty much it for tonight, i'll finish by saying Reading Buses to Purley are shite. Infact, Reading Buses are shite full stop.  Stay together for the kids!

      Possibly the most boring Football match I have ever seen. Typical bloody Rotherham with their 'let's all stand on our Goal line and hope for the best!' tactic, they were always going to be tough to beat. We wouldn't have done either, but fortunately we were graced with an 'inexperienced' referee who awarded us a penalty just before half time after Forster fell in the box from a cocked up Shaun Barker challenge. Kitson steps up, 1-0 Reading, third in the league. Get in!  The main event of the day though, was Leon's party, which was pretty damn good. After a reccomendation by Nuts Magazine, I purrrrrrchased a bottle of Tiger Beer "Nuts No.1!" This turned out to be Bullshit. Tiger Beer is just Stella in a different bottle, trust me. You can't beat a good bottle of Bud anyway. By 1am, Me, Gabs, Phil and James were lying in Leons Garden singing that  wimbaway  song out of The Lion King. Classic stuff. Me Simon and Gabs then had a Skipping Olympic race, which I duly won. And that was pretty much it.  Talking of Olympics, I was watching Ladies volleyball today. A Brazilian team were playing a Brazilian team. Bizarre.  Stay bored!

      I've only had one quick driving lesson, but i'm already addicted to it, and ever since last Saturday i've been pestering The Authorities( My parents) to take me out Driving. But thanks to the bloody rain i'm still waiting, which is bollocks. I'm blatently gunner write off my Instructors Car tommorow now, I haven't had enough practise(lol) My Instructor must be the coolest and most laidback one in, well everywhere, and he's got a cool New Mini aswell. Business is a bit quiet atm so if you need lessons ask me and i'll give you his number :-)  Anyway, enough crap. Yep, i'm bored again, which again, is the only reason i'm writing this (it's raining AGAIN atm) So i'm listening to some fanbloodytastic old Vinyls I found in My Grans house the other day while she was out. Found some absolute legendary music, Queen, ELO, Rainbow. But by far the best had to be a 17" single I found - St Winifreds School Choir, performing the life changing songs "There's no-one quite like Grandma" and "Pinnochio" These are 2 legendary tracks which i reccomend you make an effort to listen to before you die. Seriously.  In later news, My little brothers friend just threw a chair at him.  Stay Cool

        Hiya      If you're reading this you know who I am already probably. If you don't know me you have'nt missed much. Anything. Whatsoever.      I'll clear up that the only reason i'm typing this is because its the Summer Holidays and i'm bored Shitless(excuse the french) I'd prefer to be outside than sat behind a computer. But unfortunately only Gabs seems to like going outside, and he's at work. Talking of work, there are no part time jobs at all in town atm, which is crap. Part of me wishes I had'nt left Savacentre. Not sure which part.       So anyway, today was results day, and also the Day of my Theory test (Yay! test Day!) Fortunately I passed my theory and all my ASessssss. Not very well, but i passed all the same. What me and Gabs call passing with style. Even if it's a bloody good Achievement, it's not cool to shout off you Got A's across the board, not in my view. It's arrogant. Passing with style, just scraping the minimum, then feeling smug that you've lived to fight another day. Superb.
