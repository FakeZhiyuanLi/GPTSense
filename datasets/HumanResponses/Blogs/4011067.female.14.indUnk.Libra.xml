       school starts on tuesday. oh joy. actually i'm a little happy to be starting high school. i missed everybody. the freshmen start a day before the rest of the school. that's kinda cool. it'll be easier to find people that way. i have to call my friend robert and ask him what homeroom he's in. as of now, i don't know anybody in mine. all i can say is: if there aren't any of my friends in there, there better be some hot guys. and some people i can talk to. i want the hot guys 'cuz a girl's gotta have somethin to lookit right? and i want people there i can talk to so i don't get terribly bored. but if there's neither than i'll just draw and write. and daydream. that's not too bad. it sucks that i didn't get to take summer school. now i only get to take art. i wanted to take *shudder* jrotc too. but oh well. i have to take summer school next year anyway. i didn't get into geometry this year(thank god!). mr arakaki told me i should take alg. this year and kinda glide through it and get better and then take geo. in summer school. so i'm going to.  my friend rachel wasn't to impressed with ian. she's blind! that kid is sexy. but whatever.  i hope i can get a boyfriend this year. i want somethin to do on weekends*nudge, nudge**wink, wink* and i want a guy to wrestle with and talk to. doubt i'll get it though. either way, i'm really going to  try  this year. i've never really tried in school. i still get mostly a's but i never try to. so this year i'm actually going to try. and hopefully when i get a's it won't be like so what? so i got another a. what's the big deal? my mom and dad commented on that with my shrink. they say i don't take pride in my work. and i said, 'well you don't either so why should i?' see whenever i get an a they're like that's nice. parents are such hypocrites.     ___________________________________________________________________   j.b: you don't mind if i call you that do you? if you do, tell me and i'll actually write your name out. anyways... do you have an account on devart? and yea i get what ya mean. ;p

       well this is mah first post. no idea what to write. first of all, if you saw the description thingy you know this is going to be a 'whatever' blog. meaning it has no theme. doesn't that sound fun? my friend bryan is the one who got me into this. he's in kentucky.....lucky bastard.  urlLink http://zeon_soldier.blogspot.com/  that's his blog thingymajigger..... so go visit it. i have an account on deviantart. anyone heard of it? if not go here:  urlLink www.deviantart.com  it's pretty cool. if you visit my 'homepage' it just takes you to my devart page. in case anyone cares to see my art and poetry. and i have an account with FFN too. if you've never heard of it, go here:  urlLink www.fanfiction.net  my account is aoi-yuki-yume. if it doesn't come up, the story i wrote is called This Love. just a warning it's slash. which is yaoi. which is two guys. you have to go to  urlLink www.illwillpress.com . it's the absolute best! it's hilarious. go to toons and just watch them all. if you don't....prepare for squirrely wrath!!! lord and&nbsp;master will unleash his squirrely wrath and you don't want that. well that's enough ranting i guess. later...

       started school. missed the first official day. i went to the freshmen's first day. missed the next(when everyone else starts). thought it was funny. apparently wearing your contacts for 18 hours a day isn't healthy. i have bumps under my eyelids and they're scratching my eye or something. so i can't wear my contacts for a month. which sucks. but whatever. you know what? i'm getting sick of this. i've had like i dunno let's say more than 7 guys on the 'net say i'm hot. k... i don't have a problem with that. but it's only the guys on the 'net. none of the guys i actually know think i'm hot. i don't really know many guys but...that shouldn't matter. it just gets annoying. my mom owes me $161. that's sad. i like my gym shorts. i got XLarge. they hang to a little past my knees. i could've gone like medium or prolly even a small but i don't like wearin short shorts. they're like a mesh material....so comfy. i'll prolly wear 'em around the house. i need to go buy a couple pairs. we had a cool sub today in art. she's from mississippi and she said she has an accent(i didn't hear it but maybe that's cuz i lived in ky for 2 1/2 years...). she was just cool. can't wait til we actually do some art. god i saw how much my prismas are...$60. *cries* i'm gonna look into gettin an after-school job at the school. $6.25 an hour to clean classrooms for 3 hours after school. not a bad deal if you ask me.

       yay! i finally got my shirt. i so happy. it's black and in white it says: i am the gatekeeper, are you the keymaster? if you get that, tell me. you might get a prize. anyone ever seen the movie Detroit Rock City? it's cool. i finally finished Firestarter by Steven King. i had already read it but you can't find it in like  any  bookstore. so when i found it a the library i decided to borrow it and reread. took me two weeks. jeez that's sad. course i didn't take too much time to actually read it so... anyway. one of the coolest parts is when Pynchot pencils his arm. i wanna see the movie. i heard Drew Barrymore plays Charlie. she was in a buncha movies when she was little...i need to buy more pocky. strawberry is so good. i like it better than chocolate. those're the only two flavors i've had. i posted my the first chappy to my second fic. it's on   urlLink  www.fanfiction.net    and it's called Angel with the Scabbed Wings. might get a prize if you guess what that's from too. oh this is sad. this is becoming like a journal. i already have one on xanga. and nobody reads it either. you would think i'd take a hint but no....well whatever.
