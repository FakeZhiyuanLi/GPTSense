      Three days ago, i received a text message from my father and it went like this, "Gud pm, pinatawag kami ng parents ni richie, wag daw ang hindi kame pupunta sorry hindi ka na namin nahintay."  I missed his three calls and two of my brother's.  I then called them up.  My dearest kuya is getting married.  Mixed emotions.  I wasn't shocked at all coz i saw it coming na.  But when i asked inay on the date, she told me, this coming month. Sad ako, excited, and surprised.    Finally, my kuya's getting married after years of unending search for the right one.  I dunno what to feel.  Affected ba ako? "Baket kelangan ako maapektuhan eh ndi naman ako yung ikakasal?"  That's what i was thinking.  Excited pa nga ako kase, magkakaron na ko ng pamangkin na gagawin kong spoiled. Together with my nasnip, i was suddenly thinking on what my pamangkin-to-be would be calling me.  Excited na kong magkaron ng pamangkin.  Excited din ako kase magpapasukat na naman ng gown para sa kasal.  Of course, dapat ako ang maid of honor.  But, yesterday on my way home.  Because of the traffic, i had time to think, kung ano ano naisip ko, nang biglang pumasok sa isip ko yung kasal ni kuya ko.  I sent him a text message asking him san kame magpapasukat ng damit.  Naging textmates kame for the rest of my trip.  I couldn't believe that in the middle of our conversation, my tears fell.  Syempre, hiya naman ako sa katabi ko, pinigil ko, though masakit sa throat.  Ayoko pa pala mag-asawa si kuya.  Gusto ko pala nandun pa rin sya sa bahay everytime i would go home on weekends.  Pag maggrocery, pag magpapasama ako sa mall, pag magpapasundo ako sa bus stop every friday.  Yung gigisingin ko sya pag dumadating ako. Pag saturday na ayaw kong bumangon, dadaganan nya ko tapos kukulitin yung kamay ko, which i fondly called "kulinting" tapos pag hindi pa rin ako bumangon hihilahin nya yung kumot ko para finally bumangon na ko.  These simple things are only few of the things i would definitely miss about him.  Bigla ko ding na-miss yung lolo ko na mahal na mahal namin.  Na sana, he's still alive to this day para makita nya ikasal ang paborito nyang apo.  I'm sure, he would be so proud of my kuya.  Sayang, wala na sya.  Then, i passed by bf na.  Wala nang traffic.  In 10 minutes, i reached home.  I went straight to the room where cous and nasnip waited for me.  I burst into tears with matching words like these, "ayoko mag asawa si kuya.  Gusto ko lang naman magkaron ng pamangkin." And then, cous made a remark, "Dapat kase sinabi mo na, kuya, pwede naman akong magkaron ng pamangkin ng hindi ka nagpapakasal."  Then the tears stopped.    Ikakasal na talaga sya.  Wala nang makakapigil.  I just have to accept that we would eventually part ways talaga.  Alangan namang kami kami na lang buong buhay namin.  Today, on my way to the office, I was thinking of what gift i will give them on their wedding day.  I wanna give them something na hindi nya ko makakalimutan.  Accepted ko na, but still, i'm sad and crying.  Sana dumating na yung baby who would call me, tita pretty.
