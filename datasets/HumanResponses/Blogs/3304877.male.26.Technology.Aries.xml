      picked up  urlLink season 1  of  urlLink northern exposure  last night. ended up watching the first four episodes of the show last night. if you haven't ever seen the show, i suggest trying to catch it. the show had some of the greatest writing and most interesting characters that you will ever see. the dvd set is a bit of a rip-off considering that nx was a midseason replacement and only had 8 episodes in the first season. those eight episodes cost $40! now it does come in a swanky zip-up parka package that makes it really unique... for $40 for 8 eps?!? come on...   oh, and for the love of pete... someone hurry up and release season 2 of  urlLink twin peaks . i bought the first season and have been waiting forever on the next set.

      so i'm going to  urlLink otakon  in july. very excited... blah, blah, blah...   but seeing that i have the attention span of an amoeba, i'm already looking for vacation plans after that. otakon takes place in  urlLink baltimore  which is a very drivable distance from here. the metric of whether or not i can drive there determines for me if it is, in fact, a real vacation or just a weekend trip. with all that said, otakon just doesn't feel like a vacation to me. anyways...  so i was thinking of going to the  urlLink penny arcade expo  in seattle. i am a fan of the  urlLink penny arcade!  web comic but what really appealed to me about the expo was that it is really a gaming convention. alright, so i have a vacation idea - now comes the process of feeling out a cost for this excursion. i, by no means, am a rich guy and am in a savings mode at the moment (new car being the intended ultimate expenditure). there are three key components to this trip:    getting off work   hotel tickets   airplane tickets    felt out the boss today about taking a couple days off in august. evidently i'm doing my job with some measure of success since he had no objections. okay, #1 is golden. the expo website says that there's a group rate at a local hotel of $79/night. times 3 nights gives me about $240 (probably taxes and junk on top of that).  urlLink expedia  says the cheapest roundtrip airfare from philly to seattle i can get is $407. so the bare minimum total is $650 (not including food, car, and misc. other expenses). realistically, the trip will cost me a grand. ouch! *wallet wincing*  financially, i really must choose otakon or the penny arcade expo... because i can't afford both. otakon will obviously be cheaper and i already got a coworker going with me. plus, otakon is a guaranteed success where as the p.a.x. might have no turnout. on the flipside, i've never been to seattle... and the promise of a massive lan party boggles the mind.  shit...

      i came into work this morning only to find out that we had a power outage over the weekend. in most companies this would be a minor inconvenience but in my company, its a catastrophe. we are in the data delivery business and, for that reason, we advertise guaranteed uninterrupted uptime as a major selling point. we actually have power generation facilities on the premises that give us at least two weeks of full service with no external power. what happened over the weekend was that the failover to the back-up power system was being tested and obviously didn't work properly. the result was a total systems outage. most, if not all, of the servers recover automatically on their own. unfortunately, if the sequencing of restoration gets quirky then databases don't get filled properly, feeds don't turn on in order, etc.   needless to say, there were countless headaches resulting from this. the web server that i am responsible failed an integrity check on boot (due to improperly unmounted partitions), so it had to be massaged into service. of course, this took time and a few customers noticed. oh well, at least we had decent response time.

      after all the season finales in recent weeks, the time came today to clean up my  urlLink tivo . by  cleaning , i mean cancelling all the  urlLink season passes  for the shows i watched and deleting those last couple episodes of each said show. i had my season passes set up with a moving window of the most recent two episodes of each show. as a new episode was recorded, the oldest would get erased. this gave me decent economy of hard drive space and the ability to rewatch the last few minutes of the previous episode for reference (not to mention the laziness of never having to delete until the end of the season). anyways, i always find this process a little sad because it means i am now at that point farthest from new episodes for each show i watch. how depressing...  check out  urlLink mindy smith . i'm really loving her album. its folk with some country roots - nice music for warm days.

      the  urlLink flyers  just  urlLink lost  2-1 to the  urlLink lightning . getting to the seventh game of the eastern conference finals is no easy feat but doing so seems to make the sting of losing now even more painful. now i have time to kill until  urlLink football  and the  urlLink eagles  make a reappearance. hockey was great because my dad had recently gotten into it so we made a little habit of getting together to watch important games. father/son bonding at its finest. oh well, maybe i'll be able to afford hockey tickets next season.

      i have a  urlLink gmail  account now but i must admit that i was guilty of doing a little  urlLink begging  to get it. evidently, there is now a  urlLink site  where you can trade gmail invites for all manner of things. i have an account and love it so far so i definitely advocate getting one if you can - but please don't go crazy. it is, after all, just an email account. also, i received my invitation from a guy who just happened to read my blog one day and felt like doing something nice. if you have invites to give out, how about taking the high ground and not making people jump through hoops for them? just a thought...

       urlLink bruce campbell  kicks some serious ass. he whooped mummy ass as elvis in  urlLink bubba ho-tep  (which is coming to  urlLink dvd ) and has made numerous cameos in movies such as  urlLink spider-man  1 and 2. but for me, bruce campbell will always be ash from the  urlLink evil dead  trilogy. well, according to the  urlLink scifi channel  there is a  urlLink chance  ash will make a reappearance. evidently an ash vs.  urlLink jason  vs.  urlLink freddy  movie could be in the works. now, i don't personally buy into this rumor... although i hope to all hell that its true.

       urlLink fedora core 2  was released to the general public today and my first impressions are that it is a better version of core 1. i can't say that i really got a chance to dive into it that much (mostly due to the fact that the complete installs i do are time-consuming and i did three today) but i can say that it doesn't have the quirks that the core 2 test releases seemed to have. specifically, it actually installed on all three machines and didn't crash when i went to use the main menu (a first since core 1). one hiccup i did encounter was that the current  urlLink nvidia  driver doesn't seem to work with the new kernel. i'll do more research tomorrow to see if there is a workaround but it was easy enough to rollback the  urlLink X  driver for now (i can live without 3-d acceleration for a  little  while). i still hate the default bluecurve (is it still called that?) theme - makes  urlLink linux  look like  urlLink windows'  crappy stepchild.

      i've got to admit that i love  urlLink the west wing . with  urlLink bravo  airing the show in syndication, i  urlLink tivo  (i love that tivo is a verb now) and watch two episodes a day. i watched the show when it was first on but for various external reasons stopped tuning in somewhere in the second season. thanks to bravo, i'm catching up on everything i missed. i haven't been watching any new episodes to avoid confusing the timeline. anyways, just felt like pointing that out. i guess i find the  urlLink reality  of american politics rather disenchanting lately so there's something appealing about the romantic view of government the show presents. i'd like to believe that there are honest, intelligent people representing us who truly feel a sense of duty and civic responsibility. the increasing polarization in this country is very disheartening as i find that my viewpoint is not adquately reflected by either party. don't get me wrong - i love it here and appreciate the opportunities afforded to me as an american. i just wish that we had the courage to live up to the  urlLink ideals  our nation was founded on.  btw, can someone tell me how unchecked corporate campaign funding is different from bribery? how is it not corruption when representatives forgo the will of their constituents in favor of a second term?

      i love music. i find something redeeming in all genres of it. however anyone who knows me knows that, in my youth, i had a profound contempt for country music. i would be lying if i said i didn't think even now that most popular country music is crap. the reason for this is being that i find it just as  urlLink superficial  and  urlLink shallow  as the  urlLink boy bands  or  urlLink britneys  of the world. but dismissing the whole genre would be closed-minded and equally superficial. i have found that there are those who make country music who are amazing songwriters or incredibly skilled musicians.  urlLink bruce robison  comes to mind as a great example of both. another country artist who i think is a witty, creative songwriter is  urlLink brad paisley . he is also an amazing guitar player with a great technical style.  urlLink cmt  has this show  urlLink crossroads  which pairs a country artist with an artist from another genre (typically rock). last night, i watched brad paisley &  urlLink john mayer  together on the show and i thought it made for an interesting mix of styles. their styles conflicted at moments - john's bluesy background made for some indulgent moments at guitar which contrasted with brad's pristine playing.

      i knew  urlLink google  has some cool tricks in it but i totally missed the  urlLink calculator  and  urlLink definitions . the calculator works just by typing an equation into the query field and searching on it. i'm not talking just addition, substraction, multiplication, or division here as well. it supports hexadecimal, octal, and binary math as well as a number of constants like  urlLink Pi  and  urlLink c . a brief guide can be found  urlLink here . make sure to check out the neat  urlLink conversions  you can do. the dictionary function works just by typing  define:&lt;term>  in the query field (like  urlLink this ).

      i just woke up from napping. ever notice how you yawn more after napping then you did beforehand? anyways, time for a list of stuff i'm into right now...     urlLink american gods  - the novel by  urlLink neil gaiman . i just started it but i'm enjoying the read so far. will post more comments when i'm farther in.    live in knoxville 9/4/03  - a live album from the band  urlLink guster . i love the version of  either way  on this album. if you don't know these guys, i seriously advocate checking them out. btw, the album and song links require  urlLink iTunes .    urlLink got anime?  - i'm abusing the hell out of this discount membership club for  urlLink the right stuf . it gives you at least a couple bucks off any regularly-priced product in the store.    urlLink netflix  - dvd rentals from the internet. i figure if it saves me one crappy dvd purchase per month, then it will pay for itself. when i'm not feeling so lazy, i might try to get my netflix queue (42 dvds at the moment) up on the site. please don't take the  lazy disclaimer  lightly cause there are a million things on my to-do list.    man, i can't stop yawning...

      in further continuance of my lazy weekend, i just ordered pizza (online, of course).  urlLink papa johns  is having a promotion right now where you can get a dvd with a large or extra large pizza. you get to choose one of these three movies:     urlLink weekend at bernie's     urlLink trial and error     urlLink don juan de marco     i went with "don juan de marco" thinking that if i didn't like it, then i could pawn it off on one of my  urlLink johnny depp -adoring female friends. plus, i've seen "weekend at bernie's" and it hardly warrants a second viewing. and as far as "trial and error" goes,  urlLink kramer  just shouldn't do movies.

      saturdays are universally for catching up on my sleep. this was a really long week at work and i'm glad its over. got some  urlLink netflix  dvds to watch. going to go and buy  urlLink samurai warriors  for the  urlLink ps2 . i know all the reviews should be telling me to get  urlLink onimusha 3  right now but i really just want some hack'n'slash joy. nothing helps to ease the stress of work like cutting through thousands of foes as if they were paper. :-)

      for all you  urlLink linux  weanies out there (i count myself among you incidently),  urlLink fedora  core 2 was released to mirrors today according to the fedora website's  urlLink schedule . it should be publicly available next week. i really liked core 1 but found the tests of core 2 to have numerous problems. i'm really hoping they've worked them out cuz i really want the new version of  urlLink gnome  (which i've building myself into core 1 but always seems to be quirky).

      there's a new  urlLink trailer  for  urlLink the incredibles . this is the newest  urlLink pixar  movie. as a big fan of  urlLink finding nemo  and  urlLink monsters inc , i'm really looking forward to anything new from these guys. the new trailer looks great and colorful but i'm not sure if it'll match the beauty of "nemo". i didn't think the story in "nemo" was as good as in "monsters" but i thought the visuals were amazing - the underwater world was just so colorful and vibrant. no wonder  urlLink disney  is feeling pixar's loss not just fiscally but creatively.  also, be on the lookout soon for  urlLink grand theft auto: san andreas . this game will be based in the southern california area presumably. the screenshots seem to show some definite graphical improvement over the prequels. i was a big fan of the original  urlLink grand theft auto III  (and  urlLink vice city  to a lesser degree) so i'm definitely looking forward to this.

      been playing with  urlLink gmail  all day and i can tell you that it rocks.  urlLink hotmail  and all those other free email providers have got nothing on it. i really dig the keyboard shortcuts - being able to go to the inbox just by hitting ' g ' then ' i '... or going to the search field by pressing ' / '... or marking spam with ' ! '. you can navigate so much more quickly this way then with the mouse.  i do have a couple beefs that i hope will be ironed out. first, i can't seem to be able to set signatures. i could be missing some setting here or something but i can't seem to find a way to specify a signature. second, i don't like the fact that everyone i send an email to become a contact. for example, i changed the email associated with my  urlLink aim  account and this involved replying to a confirmation email from  urlLink aol . that reply-to address was added as a contact that i had to explicitly delete. maybe there's an option to control this but i couldn't find it. finally, and most importantly, it doesn't seem to work right in  urlLink safari . this is paramount to me since my  urlLink ibook  is my primary email/surfing box at home and at work.   i think that if these rinkles get worked out,  urlLink gmail  will be a total replacement for me.

      as great as internet shopping is, it is still hampered by one nagging flaw. can someone come up with a decent delivery service yet?? i mean how goddamn stupid is  urlLink ups  and others that they can't come up with a convenient way to handle deliveries when you're not home? every time i get a package delivered, its the same story - the delivery guy comes and leaves a note on my door telling me signature is required on delivery. now, since i work for a living and ups only delivers before 5:30pm there is no way that i'm ever going to get that package. i write a note on the door to just leave the package and they won't do it. i call them and they tell me i should come to their distribution center (which is a considerable drive and also has shitty hours) and pick it up. can't someone solve this freaking problem already?!? the company that does will corner the delivery market.how about a shipping plan for evening/weekend delivery only?  i really want to try google's new  urlLink gmail  eMail service. i would really appreciate an invite from anyone who has one. i've been kinda hoping that they would give accounts to  urlLink orkut  members, since i am one. i am also a  urlLink blogger  member which hasn't seemed to garnered an account either. oh well, maybe someone will read this and hook me up.

      there was a bug in the template ("Rounders") i got from  urlLink blogger . in the mock-up they use to show you the template, each post title is a hyperlink with a hover color. somehow that got broken so i had to go in and fix it myself. basically, all i did was change this:   &lt;BlogItemTitle> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BlogItemUrl>&lt;a href="&lt;$BlogItemUrl$>" title="external link" class="title-link">&lt;/BlogItemUrl> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h3 class="post-title"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;$BlogItemTitle$> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BlogItemUrl>&lt;/a>&lt;/BlogItemUrl> &lt;/BlogItemTitle>   into:   &lt;BlogItemTitle> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href="&lt;$BlogItemPermalinkURL$>" title="permanent link" class="title-link"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h3 class="post-title"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;$BlogItemTitle$> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/a> &lt;/BlogItemTitle>

      okay, i've already decided on my birthday present for next year. man, this sony  urlLink psp  looks awesome. man, i hate waiting. games don't look quite as good as the  urlLink PS2  quality we were promised but that could just be the nature of the lower-res display (480x272). or it could be just that the games are first-generation and developers are still figuring it all out.

      okay, it is admittedly strange for a 26 year-old man to publicly endorse "cute" things but what can you do? some stuff is just so syrupy sweet that you can't help but be left going "aww..."   with that, i give you the cute stuff of the moment:      urlLink Pinky:st & Pinky:cos   - basically these are little cute dolls with interchangeable parts. check out Rei and Asuka from  urlLink neon genesis evangelion  for genuine otaku love.     urlLink Azumanga Daioh   - my most recent anime investment and definitely one of the more unusual in my collection. as far as i can tell, there is no great story arc governing the series. instead, it seems to meander randomly through the daily lives of the characters. fans of  urlLink lost in translation  would appreciate where others might not.     urlLink Ultimate Cuteness   - the awesome cuteness generated by following this link can be too much for some. please use caution! yes, i admit it - i find kittens to be ridiculously cute. if that makes me less of a man then so goddamn well. :-P    in case anyone was curious, other anime in my queue right now includes  urlLink flcl ,  urlLink comic party ,  urlLink gasaraki , and  urlLink cardcaptor sakura . note that "cardcaptor sakura" would be included in this cute list except that i am already on dvd 10 so its not really a "cute thing of the  moment ".

      okay, got an email a few minutes ago with action items for a planning meeting on thursday. can someone please tell me why management feels the need to confuse developers with abbreviations that defy intuitiveness?? i'm convinced  urlLink PHBs  everywhere regard it as a personal challenge to complicate the simple. kudos to all those who can squeeze something meaningful from the following:    ECN   OTC   PDP   PDBF   LVL I/II I/R   OTCPS PP   NQDS   UQDF   TDDS   NIDS   VWOP   NIDS   MFDS    please note that all these abbreviations come from ONE email. now, i know some will cry foul claiming that these would be obvious to an employee with context. well i can assure you that i am the intended audience for this email and i have no clue what 90% of these mean. oh well, enough ranting... back to the grind.

      grrr... damned corporate firewall... blocking internet radio...   oh well, nothing much can be done about that (well i could do some neat stuff with reverse proxying and port mapping but its not the kinda day to get fired). i'm sure its just spring fever but its really beautiful outside and when it is so damn nice, the cube farm really just doesn't appeal to my aesthetic requirements. my little weather  urlLink widget  says that it is partly sunny and 85 degrees outside. a little warm for my taste but a great day for the shore...   on a side note... check out these web comics if you don't already:     urlLink Megatokyo     urlLink AppleGeeks     urlLink Little Gamers     urlLink Penny Arcade!     urlLink Questionable Content     more to come later...

      how the hell am i supposed to stay motivated and work on software that i know no one will ever see?? this company is in a downward spiral - circling the drain in its final desperate throws. the very notion of new development is both delusional and pathetic as no new clients are being signed and that is unlikely to change. so other then collecting a paycheck, why the hell am i showing up every day? my boss is riding me about a project i have no enthusiasm for and would just as soon leave on the floor. he is content to just ride out whatever shitstorm will inevitably unfold since he's just waiting on retirement. those of us who are just starting out can't afford to sit around with our jobs hanging in the balance...   fuck this working shit - it is totally overrated.  my dad told me not to be an engineer. he said that companies will always disrespect you and you'll never be appreciated. "the only way to get ahead in this life is to work for yourself..." of course, i had to go and become a software engineer anyway. i love to code but i hate not being in control of my life. i'm not sure there is a happy balance.

      yay!  just ordered tickets for  urlLink they might be giants  for  urlLink seaside park, nj  on july 29. unfortunately, this forces me to trim a day from my  urlLink otakon  trip to  urlLink baltimore . oh well, i was only planning on using that thursday for driving anyway and i guess the money i'm saving on that extra hotel night will cover the cost of the concert tix. i'm off now to put my tmbg library on shuffle play so i'm prepared for the concert... much joy.  oh... and  urlLink ticketmaster  sucks major ass. the tickets are only $15 a pop but ticketdisaster charges me $10.75 in fees ($4 convenience charge per ticket and then $2.75 for order processing). someone needs to come out with a flat-rate, $5 charge per purchase service to break ticketmaster's stranglehold on ticket sales. it is one of our country's biggest monopolies if you ask me.

      i wanted to explain the infrequency of my posts lately - and there is a reason beyond the normal laziness i often fall victim to. it turns out that the company i work for has decided to sell the division that has employed me for the past several years. no timetable is in effect (as far as the employees know) but i'm unwilling to sit on my ass until the axe falls. resume (sorry for being too lazy to find the latin character with the appropriate accent) has been revised and i'm currently at the stage where i'm calling in favors from friends and past coworkers. i've been on one interview so far but that job failed to excite me. the next step is to release my resume (again, sorry) to the general public over  urlLink monster  and  urlLink hotjobs  and deal with the virus that are headhunters. as much as i despise the gross inconvenience that is finding new employment, i must say that at least part of me is grateful. i've known for some time that i'm not doing what i should be (not to say i know exactly what that is... but i know what it isn't). hopefully this is the kick in the ass i needed to look for something better...

      sorry for not posting in the past week but its been crazy at work. still, i managed to find time to finish  urlLink neil gaiman's   urlLink american gods  and to hack my  urlLink tivo . i ended up really enjoying "american gods"... although it didn't go quite where i thought it would. one of the basic elements of the story is that the various peoples that have immigrated to the states have brought their various gods with them. unfortunately for the gods, people stopped worshipping over the years and began to praise the gods of television, the media, the internet, and other engines of pop culture. as the old gods become forgotten, their power diminishes. the novels sets the stage for a coming showdown between the gods of yore and the gods of today. now, i won't spoil anything but i will just say that this conflict is never resolved... and i was a little disappointed. reminds me a little of the "shadow war" in  urlLink babylon 5  - you become totally invested in the realization of this great conflict that never happens. its like holding your breathe as the tension mounts and then releasing it in a whimper instead of a great exhalation. you don't ever get to surmount the pinnacle. regardless, it was a great read with a great tempo so i highly recommend.  as for the tivo hacking... i replaced the 5400rpm 80gb hard drive in the unit with a 7200rpm 160gb drive. recording time (at best quality) went from 24hrs 7min to 42hrs 1min. at the lowest quality, i can record 152 hours now. the new drive is actually quieter (surprising for a faster spinning disc) and seems to make the tivo interface more responsive. only downside that i've noticed is a 2 degree increase in internal temperature (from 38 degrees C to 40 degrees C). the normal temperature range peaks at 44 degrees so i'm not too worried but i felt that some more insurance wouldn't hurt. to that end, i ordered a replacement fan (to replace the single stock one) as well as a secondary fan with mounting hardware. the secondary fan mounts near the hard drive so i'm hoping for a 6 degree or better drop in internal temperature. fyi, i ordered these parts from  urlLink these guys  and will let you know how the upgrade goes. the mounting hardware i mentioned will also let me put in a second drive at some point if i feel so inclined.

      went to a bbq that my parents hosted yesterday to celebrate july 4th. food and company were good but i just couldn't motivate myself to share in the fun. that was probably due to the fact that later today i am going into work to clean out my desk. not because i've been laid off yet, but just to avoid the need to come back when i am. the five minutes they give you to clean out your desk when you get canned wouldn't be enough for me... and i loathe having to return for it all after the fact. on the job hunting front, i have an inside track on a position i'm really excited about. hopefully that will work out, otherwise i've got nothing to look forward to except interviews. man, i really need to learn how to drink properly - it has to be an invaluable skill at times like these.
