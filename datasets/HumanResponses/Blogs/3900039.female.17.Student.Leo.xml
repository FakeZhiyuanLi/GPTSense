      Gabe is on a plan right now sleeping on his way to Australia. He comes home on my birthday now, I'm glad. He asked me if I could handle not hearing his voice for 18 days... how corny can this boy get?  We talked on the phone for a little too long last night, and we had quite a messed up conversation. It was a good one. I'm supposedly getting presents, we'll see if that happens. I still haven't even gotten pictures!  Collin come homes on Sunday, I'm really glad. I need somewhere to live part time.  I'm at Ryan's and he's fighting with me over the computer, he's a punk. He's trying to teach himself quitar and so he "needs" the computer to look up "lessons". whatever..... its my turn. he is in deep trouble now... he just tickled the crap out of me so he could listen to like two seconds of a song. Oh he is so dead later. And he is reading every word of this...and I don't care.  Work was a lot better today. My art friend Aaron Smith works there too, so I was glad to have nice person to work with. He got me a little bit more excited for school 'cause our art class is just gonna ROCK! I'll have Corynn and Jaime and Lance and Aaron and Shannon and Emily, and who knows, maybe some new juniors! And we can all be art nerds together! Oh I love it! But no more Patrick Orr to stare at all period...I don't know if I'll be able to handle that yet.... I might actually have to work instead of flaunt and flirt! AHHH!!! That's sooo hard for me haha  Only about a month left of summer...That really really really sucks. But I guess I will get to see everyone all the time. The school district is still thinking about whether we are going to have closed campus or not. They already decided we have two lunches and they are only 35 minutes.....I'm so mad. I hate the stupid people who decided that we were too irresponsible to be free at lunch. The kids who skip will find a way to skip either way, stupid administrators! Even if you lock us up and put guards at all exits and surround us with barbed wire, the kids who want to leave will find a way. Besides, the kids who don't want to be there, kind have a negative effect on the kids that do want to be there. It's so much more enjoyable without someone complaining and distracting, and just sitting there doing nothing and voicing how much they don't care. And on top of it all, afterr two years of patiently  not having parking and going to a school that looks like a war zone(construction), I think I deserve to be allowed to go to lunch...  On a lighter note, I have Friday off so I'm going boating with the Lovemarks! That's always a good time. hehe

       urlLink     I hope you have a wonderful time in New York and around. I'll miss you tons. Be safe, have fun, don't die. Remember, if you are bleeding, I'm not there to take you to the Emergency Room, so you will have to manage it on your own! HA! Don't worry, I can hold the fort down while you are gone and keep the little ones(Tina, Court, and Justine) from quareling too much. Well hopefully I will do better than I did when you went to Costa Rica... hehe. THAT was a nightmare. I love you tons, have a good time!

       This has been my favorite song lately....the other day I had it on repeat for over 6 hours... don't ask...    &nbsp;   Crash Into Me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave Matthews Band   You've got your ball, you've got your chain Tied to me tight, tie me up again  Who's got their claws in you my friend?   Into your heart I'll beat again  Sweet like candy to my soul  Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll   Lost for you, I'm so lost for you    Oh, and you come crash into me   And I come into you  And I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream   Touch your lips just so I know  In your eyes, love, it glows so  I'm bare-boned and crazy... for you    Oh, and you come crash into me   Baby, and I come into you  In a boy's dream In a boy's dream   And if I've gone overboard then I'm begging you   To forgive me in my haste   When I'm holding you so girl, close to me   Oh and you come crash into me, yeah Baby, and I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more And show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more And show your world to me In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Oh, I watch you there through the window and I stare at you  You wear nothing, but you wear it so well   Tied up and twisted, the way I'd like to be   For you, for me  Come crash into me Come crash into me, yeah Crash into me...Crash into me...  You know,  I'm the king of the castle,You're the dirty rascal  Crash into me  Please crash into me, baby...  Oh, no no no... Yes, I see the waves Come and crash into me  See the waves come and crash into me  Crash into me

      So today Courtney and I went to Collin's house to swim. I got there first so I just let myself in and everything 'cause I assumed he still was out of town. But I noticed shoes and a pillow and some odd placed things....so I kept calling him and there was no answer, so I went downstairs to his room and there was the boy and his dog fast asleep. It was one of the all time cutest things I've ever seen. He woke up shortly and I switched his laundry for him. Court and I swam and when we came back in Quentin had arrived. Then Court and I went to get ice cream(and to see Bryan oh so cute). Christina showed up at Collin's while we were gone and called to ask for ice cream too and it was a bad mess....we had so much ice cream all over the car, just a huge sticky melting mess, and then we didn't get Quentin any and I was afraid he would be upset, but he seemed fine(we are on good terms, I'm glad). Kaitlin also came over and Collin had a mini-reunion with all us. Then I sent him back off on his way to Portland with Mindy to catch a flight to Colorado for a family reunion. I seriously haven't seen him hardly at all, but he will be back for good in a week. Thank goodness... I'm having major Collin withdrawls....which is probably why I'm at his house with out him and we will prolly have a party here tonight. well not a party...more like a get together with the gang to swim and have a fire haha! So I'm going to jump in the pool now.

      so I had a blast up in portland with the girls. We went shopping and dancing and came up with some awesome ideas for next year's yearbook. It will be great. I have these huge sores on my feet from walking so much. I guess i had some blisters and they popped and now they are just disgusting. But right now, I feel very unhappy, unloved, unwanted, and uncared for. I hate my family, I hate my life, I hate myself, and lately it seems I hate my friends. I'm getting the praying-I-don't-wake-up feeling again, and I desperately wish it would go away. I'm sucking at pretending today, and everyone I've talked to has noticed.

      I'm in Portland at the moment, and we convinced Tovey to get on to the teachers' account so we could blog and check email :D today was pretty uneventful minus some arguing among us yearbookers. we are working really hard on this book and we want it to look perfect and some people are just getting in the way of that haha just joking tomorrow is a fun day, and I'll probably get to see gabe! WHOO HOO!!! we are going shopping downtown. Anyway, someone else's turn on the computer... I miss you Carol and Jenna and Ryan and Collin!

(the real deal: im spending too much time blogging and not talking to him...he envies my blog because i give it more attention than i do him.) this is outragesous!  &nbsp;

       Carol put a song on her blog about missing people who are no longer in your life. I recently had a conversation with someone I had not talked to in a long time and it made me realize how much I truly miss him, and&nbsp;missed missing him. So this is a sorry to him and the others that have somehow over time become to be&nbsp;a past and not&nbsp;a present part of my life...   Scott:  Thank you so much for caring about me and praying for me when we were younger. Tears come to my eyes just remembering the times in my life when you would pray for me and bring hope back into my eyes. You are an amazing person in every way and I hope your future remains as bright as you make it out to be. You are so optimistic and I love that about you. You have not changed in the year that we havent had an indepth conversation, and I hope you never do. I wish you luck on your wish to become a pastor; you would make a great one, and I would know as you were my own little pastor(Jeremiah 29:11, I still have it memorized). I am so sorry that high school and my own self conciousness and busyness has drawn us apart from eachother. I really wish things had worked out differently. You will always be special to me.   Ryan:  Although I have already repaired our friendship and been forgiven for the time I did ignore you and let what other people think get in the way of us, I want to say sorry again. There was a whole two years between our strong friendship and I want you to know that I feel very badly&nbsp; for making you 'non-existant' during that time and I never will try to rid you from my life. It obviously didn't work the first time, so I'm sure there is a reason why you are in my life and I will just sit back and let myself enjoy having such a fun great person in my life. I love you, Ry, and look forward to getting closer to my best friend, if that's even possible.   Tiffani:  We've been through a lot, and I'm glad I had someone there. I know you and I will always be best friends and we will always love eachother, but I also know there are things we just can't change and that there will always be a odd distance between us. I am sorry I could not be there for as much as you needed and I know you tried your hardest. I do not blame you for anything Fani and I love you dearly. Life is already separating us, and I hate it, but I don't know how to stop it. I just pray that we will always know how special our friendship was, and that it's not our faults that things didn't go our way. God has his reasons. I will never forget you.   Baily:  I'm sorry that I never took the time to get to know you, and that i judged you tremendously during the short time I did know you. I am sorry that I have much anger still and no one to take it out on but you. I know I shouldn't blame you but it's difficult not to. I know you would never have intended&nbsp;to hurt anyone you loved, but it is hard to look back&nbsp;at everything Tiff went through and blame no one.   Moyer:  I know we have never talked about it, so I guess I'm just assuming what made us grow apart, but I also know my assumption has a lot to back it up. I am sorry for what I did to you, and I know it was wrong and I regret it more than you can ever understand. I'm sure college also took it's toll on our friendship, but I know that Tyler and I were probably a bigger reason. I was a fool, and I can only look back on it now and apologize to you.   Quentin:  I took a long time, but I am glad both of us have finally grown up and gotten over all the cruel things we did to eachother. There are many things I regret, but many things about our relationship and history that have helped me to grow and mature. I am sorry for the process of doing so. I know things will never be the same and as hard as we try we will never be as close of friends as we once were and that there are many things I did that you were undeserving of, and for that I apologize.   Jacob:  Thank you for everything, including forcing me to realize I could live without you and I didn't need to depend so much on only one person. The end of our friendship made me realize how many more people I had in my life to love. I wish you well in your life. I am trying my hardest to move on and I'm sorry for needing to know more from you than you want to give. I know things will never be the same, and that makes it hard to forgive.   Zach:  I do not know how much I hurt you, or if I even did, but I know some of the things I did to you were wrong and for that I apologize. You hurt me also, but I have moved on, and I hope you have done the same. There was a time in my life that you were important, and I'm sorry that it is no more. Thank you for the fun times we had. I learned alot from our relationship.   Sierra, Autumn, Summer, Jennie, Jamie, Haley:  You are all my most prominent grade school memories. I'm sorry that as we continued with school and grew up we lost contact and our friendships. I wish you all well in life.  Brittany:  I wish I had tried harder to save our friendship back in seventh grade. You were a very important part of my life when I was young and I apologize for throwing that away.   Ricky:  You hurt me tremendously during the short time we were friends, but I want to let you know I have moved on and that I only wish you happiness and hope you are safe and well. I'm sorry that circumstances at the time only made us hurt eachother. I'm sorry that I will regret every memory I have of you for the rest of my life, and I wish I had been strong enough to change that.  Most of these people will never read these, but no one has any clue how much more of a relief it is just to get it out somehow.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        &nbsp; I said I was going to put a picture of my dear friend Carol on here so I might as well write a whole post on her.&nbsp;Carol and I have know eachother a lot longer than we have been friends. Our mom's were teachers at the same school, so we had some contact with eachother. She thought I was a tomboy(cause I was with boys all the time...) and I thought she was a snob. In eighth grade we became friends...I don't know how, lots of mutual friends I guess, and she realized I was just a flirt and not a tomboy, ha.  She is one of the most inspiriational people I have ever met. She has stood as such a great example for me so many times. She has helped me through some of the darkest times in my life, and been there every step of the way, no matter how difficult or stubborn I got, and I can't say that for very many people. I've never found anything to complain about or get annoyed with about Carol, and you have to admit that's rare when it comes to your friends because you are with them so often you have to have the little tiny things that drive you crazy.    I love you Carol, and I know you know that I would do anything and everything possible for you if you ever needed it, but I want to say it anyway. You just flat out are a wonderful amazing human being and I can't begin to express how much I care for you and your wellbeing and happiness. I do not know where I would be with out you. You once had to tell me to hang on and that things would get better because you would make them. At the time all I needed to hear was that. So hang in there, friend, things will get better, and I will make them. I love you.     urlLink

      This song is way too perfectly worded... SugarCult- Pretty Girl(The Way)   " Pretty girl is suffering  while he confesses everything  Pretty soon she'll figure out what his intentions were about   And that's what you get for falling again    You can never get him out of your head    She's beautiful as usual with bruises on her ego  and  Her killer instinct tells her to  beware of evil men   And that's what you get for falling again  You can never get him out of your head   It's the way that he makes you feel   It's the way that he kisses you   It's the way that he makes you fall in love   It's the way that he makes you cry   It's the way that he's in your mind   It's the way that he&nbsp;makes you fall in love"  &nbsp;  I barely know this person and he is all I think about. I want it to stop, but I can't make it. I don't do this, I don't fall in love, especially not when it's impossible, yet I find myself searching for every possible way to talk to him or see him. It's crazy, and it's driving me crazy. I tell myself it won't work and I should give up and stop, but then the what ifs always come back, and he isn't exactly helping my efforts. So far the only red flag is the distance, and I've already made my excuse to ignore that... and for some reason I can't ignore all the reasons in the back of my mind that are making me strongly consider it... I'm crazy... but then something will stand out to me that makes me think&nbsp;I'm not...  A long time ago, my youth pastor taught a lesson on marriage and dating and all that. It was very good and I remember much of it(sadly I didn't think the same at the time). He had us make a list of the qualities we wanted our future spouses to have. Of course some of them were very superficial and immature(as I was in junior high), but most were not. I switched rooms with my parents a while ago and went through tons of old stuff(i'm a keeper..not a throwing away kind of person), and low and behold I found this list... and the part that scares me the most, this person has a lot of the qualities I listed as a naive thirteen year old. Whether that means at thirteen I knew what I wanted or at almost seventeen I'm still imature and materialistic, I do not know, but I hope the former. It just creeps me out... I don't like the idea that I might be becoming a stupid teenage girl who is infatuated to the point she thinks she might actually... I can't even say it... bottom line: I'm crazy.

      Nickelback- Feelin' Way Too Damn Good    I missed you so much that I begged you  to fly and see me  You must've broke down 'cause&nbsp;you finally said that you would  But now that you're here  I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming   'Cause&nbsp;something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good  &nbsp;  For 48 hours I don't think that we left my hotel room  Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would  We gotta make love just  one last time in the shower   Well something's gotta go wrong&nbsp;'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good  &nbsp;  And it's like,  every time I turn around I fall in love   And find my heart face down and where it lands is where it should  This time it's like the two of us should probably start to fight   'Cause&nbsp;something's gotta go wrong&nbsp;'cause I'm feeling way too dam good   &nbsp;Oh, feelin' way too damn good  &nbsp;  Sometimes I think best if  left in the memory   It's  better kept inside than left for good   Lookin' back each time they tried to tell me  Well something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      ...and it scares the crap out of me. To think this time in only a year(which isnt as long as it seems, considering how fast all of high school went) my friends and I will be saying goodbye and living on our own. I might have to actually learn how to fold my own burritos... The other day I lost my license and had to go to the DMV, my most unfavorite place, and get a new one. My parents also mentioned my registration was up. They wrote me a blank check and told me to go, and I started bawling and wanted them to come with me, which is something I never do. I am used to doing things on my own, and generally prefer it. I acted like a baby and refused to go without them holding my hand. I don't want to grow up yet... I love just getting to sleep in when I want and call my friends and go float or randomly go camping. I love&nbsp;being able to spend someone else's money and the biggest consequence be having to return whatever I bought. I love only having to make easy decisions like what I want to wear today or&nbsp;whether I'm going to do my homework or not, not decisions like what bills to pay with this paycheck or which groceries are necessary or how I'm going to pay for college or who I'm going to marry or where I'm going to live. Right now, it feels like my friends are all I have, and I know in a year, I might have to start all over in that department. And it frightens me... As badly as I want to be on my own and have a house and a family and a career, I am scared of the process of getting there. I have an issue with happiness I think... I've gotten to the point where I don't really believe in it, just the idea that I can create my own little happiness world where I can pretend everything works. But now I'm afraid that if I really were happy or I got happiness out of anything, I wouldn't be able to recongize it...and I'd push it away like I've done so many times before.

      So yesterday I went floating the river with some of my closest friends...Carol, Justine, Jenna, Collin, Tyler..and well Collin's brother Jonathon&nbsp;went too. &nbsp;Anyways, we had an awesome time. I haven't had so much fun in a while....well minus the back hurting and hives and rock burns&nbsp;and all that... Afterwards we went camping with Justine's Mom(remember her?) at Whistler's Bend. Courtney and Christina, my other two best girl friends, came out and hung out with us for a while too but they had to work in the morning so they couldnt stay the night. It has been soo long since we were all together at once. So much laughing(well in Jenna's case, wheezy and snorting)&nbsp;and talking and rambling and nonsense and worrying(mr. grumpy gills...you know who you are). I seriously love you guys so much I just can't even explain! We have to make the most of this last year we have all together... We should mutliply our memories by a gizillion! You're the best I could ever ask for! What will I do without you when we leave for college?

       urlLink     Today I went to the farwell party for a very special person, Moritz Julian Jungmann, a German exchange student. It didn't really hit me until I went to hung him goodbye and it's wierd to think I might never see him again. Hopefully, that doesn't happen. He is an awesome, hilarious person and I love him dearly and will miss him tons. The picture is of Carol, Christina, Mo and Mark at New Years. Come back and visit Mo, and if I'm ever in Germany, I better see you! We have so many great memories... New Years at Justine's, getting pulled over by your house(thats the best one! HA), your belly, dancing, helping you write essays with proper grammar, so so many... I'm thankful to have had you in my life :D

      So I hung out with Lance today and we watch Butterfly Effect, it was really really creepy, but overall I think I liked it. We also went to the river and threw rocks in the water to get eachother wet, it was pretty funny. But while I was dropping him off at his house, I got a phone call...FROM LINUS OAKES ABOUT A JOB INTERVIEW!!! YES!! WHOO HOO!!! It's been soo long and I haven't heard from anyone I've applied to, so this is very good. :D and my dear friend Collin comes home tomorrow, well kinda late tonight, but early tomorrow morning is more like it. He's been in Mexico for a long long long time and I missed him alot so I'm very glad he will be home...for a whole five days...whoo hoo....no. anyways, I'm hanging out with my computer geek ryan and he is telling me what to type about and he suggested this story....the snake from hell. So while Lance and i were exploring at the river, I stepped on a snake and it jumped out and striked at me and hissed and i freaked out and was hysterical of course....it was bad. And this wasnt no gardner snake, it was LONG AND BROWN! I dont know what kind...which only scares me more. Ryan thinks it was an anaconda...I doubt it :D He is my massively best friend and he just wants to get me to freak out cause im so gullible but its not working this time hehe anyway, hope everyone is having a good day. Okay he just said "thats it? no life lesson?" sorry I'm no jacob bentley. BUt here, kids...dont do drugs, don't drink alcohol, and don't have sex. thats all folks!(happy ryan?)

      So last night I played bunko, and it was tons of fun. Mom(aka Pam aka St.joe's Youth Pastor aka Justine's mom), Justine, Carol, Alex, Seth, Emily, some Chris kid I just met, Trevor, Jenna and I all went out to Applebees afterwards to eat(obviously). Gabe kept text messaging me and I was getting a little too giddy and Carol had to tell me to turn my cell phone noise off haha...whoops. Sorry Carol! I also had quite a blonde moment when Seth, who was sitting right next to me, called me and I talked to him..."Who is this?" "Seth" "who?" "SETH" "I dont know any Seths" okay it wasnt that bad but you get the picture. I just found out last night that I get to go on the yearbook retreat for sure!!! I'm really excited! Hopefully Gabe and his friends will go to the "quest"(name of the underage club) with us. He hasn't sent me the pictures yet grrr... Lance also called and I am hanging out with him today! Should be fun...he is my little art friend, we always had good times in art, so I'm sure we will today. My cell phone went off soo many times...normally I get excited but I was almost irritated. Carol compared me to a monkey again because I was climbing over chairs to get out to talk on the phone. Well maybe you look like a monkey too!!! no, carol is goregous and she is my bestest friend, i will post a picture of her later hehe. Anyway, that was my life last night... Yes, Ryan, I am trying to make this blog as boring as possible! HAHAHAHA

      So, my parents will finally come home today YEAH! They just called me a few minutes ago. I hate being home alone at night. It's been scary, but I've survived. My good friend Justine also just made a blog... I'm beginning to think Jacob is a trendsetter... before you know it, everyone will be blogging like crazy, but I hope not. I wouldn't be able to keep up. So tonight I'm going to go play bunko with my friends at St. Joe's. Should be fun, I love that game. I might stay the night at Heather's, but plans for that have not been finalized. Gabe, my new friend from Washington, is supposed to be emailing pictures today of us up there at Forth of July. They are supposed to be super good...we will see. I hope I get to see him soon.

      The other day Ryan and I attempted to take some pictures with his camera, these are the results....                                Not so good.....but heck, we tried! Ryan's eyes were having problems adjusting to the flash, and i just went a little overboard with my smile. Ever since I got my braces off, I've had this uncontrolled smile and I just freak out.

       Love Soon           John Mayer   I know you've been sworn  I read your complaint  You're needing someone older  And though I've been warned to live day by day   There's something taking over  Did you expect to kiss me one time While looking at me with the same eyes ever again So come on and face it  So come on and face it   It's time that we say it    You can cross the line whenever you want to   I'm calling it love soon   Close your mind and waste some time if you have to  I'm calling it love soon  It's not about you now   It's what we are   You're mother complains that you need a man  You haven't mentioned me yet  And all of your friends don't know who I am  I've been your best kept secret   I understand I wasn't part of the plan  A dollar short, a minute early But I am your man  Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because  The minute hand moves faster than you think it does   And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine   The bottom line is lyring in the bed that we've been playing in tonight

      Well now that he's been on the other side of the world for a while, it's been a lot easier to not think about him as much, or to think about the "situation" in a negative way, and to think of someone else in a positive way. Another impossible one.... I hate this.

      Yellowcard       Ocean Avenue     There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you  We were both 16 and it felt so right   Sleeping all day, staying up all night  Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right  Sleeping all day, staying up all night  Staying up all night   If I could find you now things would get better   We could leave this town and run forever   I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together   Let your waves crash down on me and take me away    There's a piece of you that's here with me   It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see   When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by   I can make believe that you're here tonight  That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever  I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now  We're looking up at the same night sky   And keep pretending the sun will not rise   We'll be together for one more night   Somewhere, somehow    If I could find you now things would get better   We could leave this town and run forever  I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

      Only 13 more days until I'm seventeen freakin' years old!!! I'm really excited. For my birthday I've decided to ask for: scrapbook stuff(for a senior scrapbook), vases and boxes to decoupage(for myself for once), pretty much anything from Michael's craft store, and for Gabe to come down for a few days. Okay wishful thinking on the last one, but I'm allowed to dream. Gabe sent me an email :D :D he misses me, I'm excited. Anyway, my friend Carol is in New York, and the terror alert there is red now... and I'm a little paranoid. Kinda creepy, one friend is across the world and the other across the country and we have a red terror alert, not good. But my friend Collin is now home safe and sound for good. I've spent the past two nights doing nothing at his house, it's always good. Music in the park is tonight and I'm going with the girls. Alex maybe too. I'm not really in the mood to go yet tho... Hopefully later, we will see. The scabs on my feet are all better, I'm really glad. I have some beautiful scars instead tho. Justine got pictures back from the yearbook retreat and Grafitti. They are really cute! I'll post them when I get a chance. I love my friends, we are so cute! HA, Jonathon(collin's brother) told us to use better adjectives...We said cute every two seconds about every picture... it was bad. So we went with adorable and pretty and  goregous and fun and gross and ugly and I think we threw in whorish a few times... I watched Kill Bill with the SCs.... bloodiest movie ever, it was disgusting! And then it just freaking ends with no real ending!!!! grrr.... stupid movies I'm done.
