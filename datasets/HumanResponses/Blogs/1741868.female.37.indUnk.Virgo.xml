      In two more days I will have been blogging for a year, it may not look like it because I've done a little house cleaning. Out with the old and in with the new is the system I feel most comfortable with right now. I decided instead of taking some kind of hiatus (which is what I was considering) that I should just wipe the slate clean and begin again. There are quite a few things I had written here that I liked some I even loved, I saved those posts and will add them here and there as time permits. Everything else was really just crap. It's possible that anything new I decide to post will be crap too, but that's ok. It just feels right to start fresh, without all the self-depricating, useless drivel. Damn I feel good! I hope you feel good right along with me!   **Update: I've re-posted everything I intended to save - not in any particular order just things I've happened upon that I wanted here. So pretty much anything previous to this post was written some time in the past year...**

      "The whole world is divided into two halves for me now: one is she, and there all is joy, hope, light; the other is where she is not, and there all is gloom and darkness..." - Prince Andrei Bolkonsky Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace  There are moments in your life where the clouds shift their shadows, the earth quakes beneath you, the momentum of swift stars and worlds impels you toward something mysterious and unexpected. I will never forget the night of January 31st, 2004.  The night we met.

      About an hour or so before my alarm was set to go off, I was jolted awake by my own sharp cry as the intensely sexual scenario I had been dreaming culminated in a violent orgasm. Gasping, heart racing, my palm pressed against the heat between my thighs, I had curled on my side and moaned into the darkness. Eyes wide open, searching the shadows, I had seen Stephanie's face. I had been dreaming of her leaning over me, holding me down with the barest of touches, while she turned my blood to fire with a kiss.

      ...In my arms, the way I fit in yours. I held you this morning as you slept and I had to fight to let you go when you woke up. I want to see you stretched out underneath me. I want you open and wanting me as badly as I want you. I want to take you with my hands, my mouth, my tongue -- any way you want, any way you've ever imagined. I want you helpless to do anything but respond to me -- to the press of my breasts against yours, the sound of my voice in your ears. And I want to do it all knowing that as soon as you come, you're going to turn around and demand the same thing of me.

      In your eyes I can see into the depths of your soul. I know you as I know myself. You have always been a part of me, even before I knew your name. You will always be a part of me, long after our names have lost meaning. You live in my heart and I love you. Love that reaches beyond my need to have you, beyond my desire to hold you, beyond my fear of losing you. In your eyes I see your capacity to love. There is an infinite amount of love that you give freely. In your embrace I am home. In your arms my soul is still, my heart at peace, and I am safe. In your arms is where I long to be.

      I'm generally a very coordinated person. I play(ed) sports, I have relatively good balance, I'm in pretty good shape, I'm good with that eye - hand coordination stuff. So, I get a little irritated when my usual grace eludes me. However, I find it pretty amusing when it happens in bed. I mean you have to be able to laugh about these things. Right?!  Now when I say "Safe Sex", I'm not talking about condoms or dental dams or anything like that. I think in my case a helmet and the occasional ice pack might be more appropriate. And there are just some areas of the human body where "Slippery When Wet" should be posted clearly.  I'd love to think of myself as a smooth, romantic, passionate lover, and I'm told that most of the time I am. I have my moments though, when I get a little riled up, and making love turns into some sort of bad slapstick comedy. If nothing else, it makes for amusing conversation later and Steph and I, well, we laugh about it a lot. Mostly at me, the knot on my head, and that muscle that I didn't even know existed...Until I pulled it. Ouch.

Intimacy develops more slowly, and commitment more gradually still. -- Robert Sternberg  There was a disturbance in my heart, a voice that spoke there and said, I want, I want, I want!

      She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies, And all that's best of dark and bright Meets in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellow'd to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.  One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impair'd the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress Or softly lightens o'er her face, Where thoughts serenely sweet express How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.  And on that cheek and o'er that brow So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent.

      (Originally Posted March, 2004)  She exudes confidence in the bedroom. She can be fierce. Unrestrained, and yet, so gentle. She causes me to feel things I've never experienced before. Just thinking about it now, I find my mouth suddenly dry, and other places decidedly not. When she asks me, "What do you want?" or "What do you need?" desire grips my throat and I can barely answer.  I have had a problem with letting go. I have wanted to cry out in wonder and exultation, but the sound would get strangled in my throat. I have wanted to give myself over, surrender to sensation, but fear (of humiliation, embarrassment?) held me back. Then, just today, she asked me the question I needed most to answer. "Do you trust me?"  And I realized, I do.  She touched me so lightly, and then with gradually increasing pressure, until I thought I would burst. And when she took me over the edge a cry tore from within as she whispered "I've got you, baby. Just let go."

      The only sound in my head is the roar of anticipation that I will see you soon. My heart is soaring with happiness beyond the capacity of anything to contain.  Know that when you get mysteriously distracted, it is I invading your thoughts. And when you get unaccountably aroused, it is I assaulting your dreams.  You take me places I didn't even know existed.  Since we saw each other I can't stop thinking about you. No matter how I try to shake myself into the here and now, I cannot take my mind away from the there and then.

      What on earth is creativity? How can a concept be so important in human thinking, so crucial to human history, so dearly valued by nearly everyone yet be so elusive?  Creativity has been studied, analyzed, dissected, documented. Educators discuss the concept as if it were a tangible thing, a goal to be attained like the ability to divide numbers or play the violin. Cognitive scientists, fascinated by creativity, have produced volumes of bits and pieces, offering tantalizing glimpses and hints, but have not put the parts together into an understandable whole. To date we still have no generally accepted definition of creativity - no general agreement on what it is, how to learn it, how to teach it, or if, indeed, it can be learned or taught. Even the dictionary finesses definition with a single cryptic phrase: "creativity: the ability to create," and my encyclopedia avoids the difficulty altogether with no entry, even though another admittedly elusive concept, "intelligence," is allotted a full-length column of fine print. Nevertheless, books abound on the subject as seekers after creativity pursue a concept that seems paradoxically to recede at the same pace at which the pursuers advance.

      (Originally Posted January, 2004)   Late in the afternoon, while the girls were still at school, I sat down on the sofa with Little D. He was tired and a bit cranky, he needed a nap, but I needed to hold him. He rested his head on my shoulder and wrapped his little arms around my neck, it wasn't too long before I felt his body relax and I knew he was asleep. I should have put him in his bed at that point but I couldn't bring myself to move. Instead, I sat there with him and rubbed his back. In the quiet I could feel his heartbeat and his soft breath on my neck and it was perfect. One moment of peace in the middle of an otherwise chaotic day, and it was just what I needed.

      Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I cannot accept, and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those people I had to kill today because they pissed me off. And also, help me to be careful of the toes I step on today as they may be connected to the ass I may have to kiss tomorrow. And help me to remember when I'm having a really bad day, and it seems that people are trying to piss me off, that it takes 42 muscles to frown and only 4 to extend my middle finger and tell them to BITE ME!

      What is a friend? I will tell you. It is a person with whom you dare to be yourself. Your soul can be naked with him. He seems to ask of you to put on nothing, only to be what you are. He does not want you to be better or worse. When you are with him, you feel as a prisoner feels who has been declared innocent. You do not have to be on your guard. You can say what you think, so long as it is genuinely you. He understands those contradictions in your nature that lead others to misjudge you. With him you breathe freely. You can avow your little vanities and envies and hates and vicious sparks, your meannesses and absurdities and, in opening them up to him, they are lost, dissolved in the white ocean of his loyalty. He understands. You do not have to be careful. You can abuse him, neglect him, tolerate him. Best of all, you can keep still with him. It makes no matter. He likes you - he is like fire that purges to the bone. He understands. He understands. You can weep with him, sing with him, laugh with him, pray with him. Through it all - and underneath - he sees, knows and loves you. A friend? What is a friend? Just one, I repeat, with whom you dare to be yourself.  -- C. Raymond Beran

      So, you want to know why I love you? The love I feel for you is the most comfortable and unthreatening and peaceful love that has ever gone in or come out of my heart.  Looking into your eyes, I have found naked truth in its rarest form. The honesty that flows from the richness of your soul brings me humbly to my knees - touched to the point of tears. To allow yourself to care for me, such that you do, is truly a brave and noble thing in this hard, cruel world.  I know it is difficult to expose your innermost being - even to yourself. Yet, you have allowed me to experience the tender beauty which is so often kept safely behind walls in case of ambush. Before me, unprotected and afraid, you have spread open the very heart of your existence.  With a gentle, sensitive heart you have chosen to love me in spite of my flaws and imperfections. It is this defenseless, yet pure sensitivity that continually reaches out to surround me from the inside out.  Each time drawing me closer. Each time unashamedly holding me tighter. Each time strengthening the bond that helps our friendship endure the world. Each time adding something special to the meaning of love.  You are the special friend for whom I have been searching. You are the one who has fulfilled the desire of my heart - to feel the kind of love that I tried so hard to give. You have given me a special place in your life. For this I thank you, and I love you from the depths of my being, today and forever.

      You are beautiful, my friend. You know and accept me as I am - all of me, and I love you for this. You have made me happy to be me and I love life more because of you.  I can be myself with you and am very happy in knowing that we experience much of the same sensitivity to the world around us. You always express how you feel to me, and so, I am never afraid to do the same. The meaning of our friendship is found in the joy of celebrating it.  You will forever be a part of me now - for our souls have reached out and gently touched one another. I will always love you throughout my life, for you are - a friend of mine.  --Larry S.

      I feel your warm breath upon my skin. A burning path of searing heat, as you awaken me with your kisses. I feel your hands as they gently caress my skin. I open my eyes and look into yours; we become lost in each other. A flame ignites inside and you feel the warmth that surrounds you. A raging fire of passion rises. We become the flames, we are the fire. My hands-your hands, my lips-your lips. There is no beginning and no end. We have molded into one another, shaped together as two perfect lovers, you and I. One heart. One soul. One whole.

      At times I can feel her watching me. Often it's when I'm busy concentrating on something else, like making dinner or even driving the car. That certain look, the kind that lasts for more than a few seconds, is very much like a caress. It is then that a persistent stirring begins to make itself known between my thighs, as I imagine her hands on me.  Stop it.  What? She raises her hands in the air, feigning innocence, her smile infuriatingly confident.  You know what! I'm trying to drive over here!  Okay, okay. I was just looking.  No...You weren't.  And she just laughs and pretends to look out the window.  She makes me want things I can't even put words to. She tells me she doesn't need words, she can feel it. I like being guided by her touch, comfortable enough to surrender to her direction. It is still such a new experience --wanting so much to be wanted, wanting so much to please. There are times when our lovemaking is wholly satisfying, and yet arousal is merely a breath away. Desire simmers hot beneath her skin and she wants me to burn with her. It's then that I know I have to have her again.  One more time.

      (Originally Posted March, 2004)   Simply the sight of her is enough to bring heat to my depths, but it's the look of undisguised desire in her beautiful brown eyes that nearly knocks me off my feet.  "I'm not going to be able to finish making dinner if you keep looking at me like that," I warned as I leaned against the counter.  "I'm not sure I can stop," she replied and then quickly added, "I'm not really all that hungry anyway, at least -- not for food."  With what I would swear was a slight growl, she moved across the kitchen, her arms suddenly around me and her lips possessing mine with a gentle insistence. Her hands traveled the length of my sides , clasping my hips, pulling me closer. As our lips parted, I moaned with the loss. I dropped my head, resting it on her shoulder and threaded my arms around her waist, just holding on.  I tightened my hold on her, relishing the tight fit of her thigh between my own, the curve of her breasts against mine, the answering surge of her hips and whispered, "I'm so glad you're here."  Tenderly, she cupped my jaw and leaned in for another long, searching kiss. "Me too," she whispered back when our lips parted.  She then took me by the hand, leading me back to the bedroom. Once there, the momentum changed with that surge of confidence that she radiates. There was no fumbling or frustration at the amount of time it took for her to remove her clothes and then my own. With each bit of my body that was revealed and exposed, her warm mouth was there to welcome it. I was trembling, not knowing if I wanted to kiss her again or to be kissed by her again. Either way I had to have those exquisite lips once more, had to lose myself in her touch.  Radiantly beautiful, she threw the covers back and slipped into bed. She gently pulled me down to her and as she wrapped her arms around me I could feel myself melting into the warmth and softness of her body. Her lips sought out a nipple as her hand moved down my body. The feather-like stroking began and I was lost.  "Is this okay?" she asked softly.  "Yes," I replied in a breathy whisper. "God, yes."  Afterward, I lay staring at the ceiling, watching the dance of light and shadow given off by the soft glow of the candles. Steph lay against me sleeping lightly, one leg thrown over my thighs, her graceful arm curled across my chest, holding me possessively. The only thought running through my head was  I could stay like this forever.

      (Originally Posted March 2004)   I paused to watch you as you slept, thinking about how beautiful you are, and about how lucky I am to have you. You were lying on your side, your legs pulled up, your hands together, beneath your pillow. The sheet was tangled around your feet, allowing an unhindered view of your whole body. The scene ignited a fire inside me. I bent to kiss you on the cheek. As you stirred, I spread kisses along your neck, then to your breasts where I lingered, gently suckling each one.  You awoke and smiled at me as you ran your fingers through my hair. Then you rolled over onto your back, and I slid the flat of my hand slowly down your body. My lips eagerly returned to your neck, as my fingers touched the core of your passion. You were so still that I could feel the rhythm of your heartbeat steadily climb as I continued to touch you between the soft folds of skin, and deep inside you.  Your legs opened for me, and I slipped between them, tasting you. As my tongue stroked and flicked, your breathing became frantic. You gasped and moaned as the pleasure burst through you. You were so sexy. So wet. Suddenly you screamed out as you climaxed, and as I felt the orgasm wrack your body, the pleasure burst through me as well. Afterward, I lay beside you contentedly, and you gave me a slight grin when you said...   That's got to be the best wake-up call I've ever had.

      (Originally Posted March, 2004)  I took myself out to dinner earlier this evening. I thought it would be fun to go to the restaurant/bar where Steph was working to eat. I forgot it was St. Patrick's Day. I guess I never realized how silly people look and act while drinking green beer. It was almost entertaining.  She was bartending tonight and I sat at the bar so I could at least look at her. We didn't get too much time to chat because of all the green-beer-drinkers, but I did get to spend her break with her. That was nice.  You know, it's been nearly 20 years since I've made-out in the back seat of a vehicle with someone, but this was very different from that experience. It was the very first time I've ever made out in the back of a van. Those captain's chairs recline nearly all the way back. I was reminded of that little fact very quickly. Not an altogether unpleasant evening!  Here I thought I'd only be able to stalk her from my bar stool, and surprise! I got to grope her in the dark (and relatively chilly) backseat of my van. Now you might be thinking I behaved poorly this evening, but I found it a little exhilarating and almost (but not quite) naughty. Actually, I don't care what you think, because it was fun. And unexpected. And fun. Did I mention the fun?

      It’s hard for me to believe that she doesn’t know how attractive she is. I often get the sense that she rarely thinks about herself. I know that when we sit together talking she has no idea the effect she has on me. My heart races, my skin tingles, my palms grow damp. I struggle to hide the faint trembling in my hands, I have no doubt she will recognize my desire.  Simply raising my hand to brush away a few wisps of hair straying across her face, her eyes widen and her lips part waiting for my touch. I see in her eyes that my fingers against her skin will never be unwelcome. There is only the stillness in her face and the thrilling beat of blood beneath the skin of her neck.  She waits as my fingertips hover above her cheek, her gaze warming mine, and the pleasure of the moment is so acute my breath escapes me on a sigh. She smiles at the sound. I brush the hair from her face, my fingers sliding behind her ear, my thumb gently caressing the angle of her jaw. She leans closer and I can see the swirl of emotion in her eyes. With the first brush of her lips, I understand that a kiss can be everything.  The first touch is always tender, but not tentative. I am aware of nothing beyond the silken warmth of her lips moving over mine. As she welcomes my tongue in her mouth, with a long slow caress, need hammers through my blood and settles like a fist between my thighs.

      When we returned to Steph's apartment Sunday it was suggested that I model my new clothes. I was more than happy to do this for her, especially since I had talked her out of the leather pants she had intended to buy and convinced her the chaps would be more interesting. Have you ever worn leather pants? - too tight, too hot, no thanks. I have to admit I was a little nervous, she still had that look in her eyes. We hadn't had lunch yet and I was starting to feel like I was going to be the only item on her lunch menu. Not that I have a problem with that, she just kept looking at me like she was hungry and I don't mean for a turkey sandwich.  I slipped into the bedroom and removed my t-shirt and bra, slipping the vest on and buttoning all but the top button. I don't usually wear clothes that are terribly revealing and I'm not the type to try to enhance the look of my breasts in any way, yet I suddenly found myself sporting some serious cleavage. The thing I liked most about the vest was the fact that since I've been working out a bit and swimming every chance I get, I have some good muscle definition in my arms. I have to say, that looked pretty hot.  I put the chaps on over my jeans and realized that I liked the look of them. It's funny how a piece of clothing can make you change your posture, the way you walk, your whole demeanor. I looked at myself in the mirror and liked what I saw, thinking to myself Damn, I look good. I cracked the door to the bedroom and told Steph to sit on the couch with her eyes closed. I hooked my thumbs in the top of my jeans and sauntered out to stand in front of her.  Ok, you can look now.  All she could say was, "Oh babe, you look...Oh yes...Good, very good!"  I'll wrap this up quickly by saying that the items came off a lot faster than they went on, and while I was still struggling to catch my breath after my little fireball ravaged me, she dipped her head, whispering in my ear, "Next time you wear the chaps - lose the jeans."  Who am I to argue?

      So often I sit here wondering what I hoped to accomplish by starting this blog and, after nearly a year, it still puzzles me. I suppose I had hopes of developing a familiarity with my own thoughts and feelings. Getting more comfortable with me. Finding a way to express myself. Something like that. I've never been very good at expressing my feelings and I know I still need to work at it. A lot. But I feel better about it now than I did in the beginning. I'm not now, nor have I ever been, in search of a large audience. I enjoy the people that visit here regularly and I appreciate their comments. If you're sitting there wondering if I'm talking about you - I probably am. I keep thinking about those bloggers out there that rack up hundreds or even thousands of hits a day - quite frankly that scares the crap out of me. I realize that they don't write a personal blog, and I suppose that makes all the difference. And as for me, well, for the most part I lead a rather ordinary life.     In this age when fame is the altar at which most people worship, I am notsure why you should care who I am or that I exist. I am not a celebrity, I am not the child of a celebrity, I have never been married to, never been abused by, and never provided a kidney for transplantation into any celebrity. Furthermore, I have no desire to be a celebrity. In fact I am such a nonentity by the standards of our culture that People magazine not only will never feature a piece about me but might also reject my attempts to subscribe to their publication on the grounds that the black-hole gravity of my noncelebrity is powerful enough to suck their entire enterprise into oblivion.  From: Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz      The biggest problem for me, it seems, is that I don't view the world in 2-3 paragraph increments that I can blog about. When something or someone amuses me I don't always remember exactly what happened or the circumstances that made it so funny. The only thing I am ever sure of is how I feel. Honestly, that doesn't make for the best reading material, but it does help me remember that the only person I can ever truly write for is me. And I guess that's why I started this thing to begin with.

      A lingering fragment of dream is keeping me distracted. The two of us together - you on your back and me on my side, my head resting on your shoulder and my hand between your legs massaging you gently.  How I wish you were teasing my breasts and belly with your wonderful kisses. I love the way your mouth makes me wriggle and squirm, makes me impatient to finally feel your sweet tongue sliding into the welcoming wetness between my legs.  Except that you are so smart, funny, creative, warm, empathetic, athletic and beautiful, I can't think why I admire you so much. Maybe it has something to do with your talent for fucking me like I've never been fucked before...  Drifting quietly in the between of consciousness and sleep, I pull you closer to feel your warmth. My breasts press lightly at your back, my arm draped over your side, my fingers tracing lazy circles on the soft, warm skin of your belly. Your breathing slows and deepens as I feel you falling into the abyss of sleep. I whisper quietly into the darkness  I think I could love you . A small sigh escapes your lips as you gently grasp my hand.  I know, I love you too.

      ...That just drive me wild.  Her eyes. I can look into her eyes for hours. I can see, in reflection, the way I look at her. If I look deep enough I can almost see what she sees in me. By then, though, I usually have to look away. I see the caring, sensitive, loving, compassionate person that she is. There are those times, however, when I see nothing but passion. The look that has fire behind it.  Her hands. Damn, she has great hands. Strong but soft, and when she touches me, I melt. Her hands can transform me into liquid heat. Her hands can elicit such an intense yearning, a longing to be touched again and again.  Her soft lips and that wonderful tongue. Oh my...Can cause me to cry out as I have never done before.  And when she whispers in my ear, "Oh Baby". Or when she asks of me, "Harder, Baby". Especially the "Oh god". That can make me want to move mountains to please her.  Yes, there are things about her that just drive me wild.

      You know... The kind of day where deciding what to make for dinner can bring on an uncontrollable fit of rage. When you wake up knowing that, sometime during the night, your body was taken over by raging hormones. Hormones - spawn of the evil bitch goddess (yes, that's PMS to you and me).  Too much information? Oh Grow up! It happens to the best of us.  I've grown to secretly enjoy the acerbity of PMS. I often get away with bringing total chaos to the household. And as I'm usually the one trying to keep a lid on things, it's nice to fly off the handle every once in a while. I can't do it every month, mind you, perhaps only every other month. Seeing as I've forgotten whether or not I let the bitch in me out last month, I'm letting it out now. Pray hard and often for the children as they usually walk the fine line between life and death, on this, my one day of pure evilness. Is evilness a word? Do I really care?  Don't worry, I'll be over it in the morning. I'll be back to that shy, quiet girl who is afraid of a lot of stupid shit. But for now, I fucking rule!

             you are darkslateblue  #483D8B         Your dominant hue is blue, making you a good friend who people love and trust. You're good in social situations and want to fit in. Just be careful not to compromise who you are to make them happy.  Your saturation level is medium - You're not the most decisive go-getter, but you can get a job done when it's required of you. You probably don't think the world can change for you and don't want to spend too much effort trying to force it.  Your outlook on life can be bright or dark, depending on the situation. You are flexible and see things objectively.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      (Originally Posted February, 2004)  After an hour or so of laughing and a couple of beers, the conversation lulled. We stared at each other for a long moment then I shied away, finding solace in my bottle of beer. I could feel her gaze on me still. Heat flushed my cheeks then moved lower . . . much, much lower.  "I'm making you nervous," she said.  I chuckled without humor. "No, I'm making me nervous."  "And why's that?"  "Because," I said, looking up to meet her gaze, "I'm thinking how nice it would be to kiss you again."  "I'm thinking that, too."  I swallowed the last of my lingering apprehension then bent forward, an overture that she welcomed by leaning in to meet me until, at last, our lips met. The kiss started out slow, like first kisses so often do. Mouths opened wider in deepening hunger as the kiss developed, consuming us both. There was a lushness to her lips that captivated me. I couldn't get enough of them, still tasting of beer, wanting the kiss to go on forever. Her tongue unfurled with a sureness that made me whimper with need. Her eager hands went for my breasts and promptly spilled the beer in my lap.  "Oh shit," she said. "I'm sorry."  "Never mind that," I growled. "C'mere . . ."  Setting our glasses on the table, I pulled her to me and kissed her soft lips once more. I slipped my tongue into her mouth and she captured it, sucking it, teasing it with her own. The impatient hands that had tried to find my breasts before found their mark now, feeling me up through my shirt. I moaned under the expert touch, running my fingers through her dark hair, urging her on, losing myself in the passion. Heat flared deep inside me, like a volcano erupting, and I groaned with raw desire for this woman. My fingers twined in her hair as she squeezed my breast, the pad of her thumb stroking my nipple through my shirt and bra until the little nub within turned to stone. I moaned and arched to push more of my breast into her firm grasp.  The kiss reached a slow, delicious end that left us both panting for breath and staring at each other with longing. I reached up and touched my fingertips to her cheek and she captured my hand, dragged it to her mouth, and began sucking my fingers. I thought I would come right there. I savored the delightful warmth around my fingers for a long moment then pushed myself up off the sofa with effort, beckoning her to follow me with nothing more than a gaze full of promise and a smile on my lips. That was all it took; she followed without a word...

      (Originally Posted February, 2004)  You take my hand and lead me to the bedroom. Once inside you kiss me softly once just before you silently pull my shirt up over my head. Tossing it casually aside, you turn me around and deftly unhook my bra. I shiver slightly as it easily falls to the floor. Before I can turn back around you've come up behind me lightly kneading my shoulders, then running your hands down my back and around gently stroking my stomach. Ever so slowly you slide your hands up towards my breasts. My breathing increases and I gasp slightly as your hands cup my breasts, gently squeezing, rubbing your thumbs over my taut nipples. Removing your hands, you turn me around, reaching out for the button on my jeans, slowly easing down the zipper, letting your fingers drift down past my panty line, teasing. You hook your thumbs into my belt loops and pull both jeans and panties down over my hips, over my thighs, releasing them at my ankles. While stepping out of the middle of them I kick off my shoes and socks.  You ease me down onto the bed my arms collapse as you push me back. I lay on my back with my hands behind my head, breasts lifted to you inviting you to touch. Your fingers, barely brush my skin, softly caressing along my cheek, down my neck, trailing slowly over my right breast. Across to the other breast, then resting with that nipple snug between your thumb and finger. I reach out to you, as if to help undress, and you gently bat my hand away. Smiling you lean over and kiss me again, still teasing my nipple with your hand, pulling, softly tugging, you lower your head and replace your hand with your mouth. Your tongue flicking, your lips sucking, my nipple hardening with every stroke.  You climb further onto the bed, straddling my stomach, and I reach up hoping to touch any part of you, but you firmly grab my wrists pushing my arms up over my head and me back down onto the bed. It takes only a second to realize that you have me pinned. Holding my wrists with one hand you reveal two silky scarves you must have hidden under the pillow. I struggle only slightly as you somehow manage to trap each wrist with a scarf and secure them each to a bed post.  You smile seductively as you climb over me and off the bed, your hands move to your own shirt undoing the buttons...so slowly...too slowly. I want so badly to touch you and I reach out to you with all my strength, a futile effort as the knots hold. You seem to enjoy watching me struggle as you remove the rest of your clothing, and approach the bed again.  Leaning over slightly you let your fingers drop down between my outstretched legs. You can feel the heat of my anticipation even before you touch my skin. You let your finger glide down between my slippery folds, easily finding my swollen clitoris giving it a light stroke. I nearly cry out at your first touch, squirming, my hands grasping the silk bonds wanting more.  Again that devilish smile, as you climb back onto the bed, straddling my stomach. Noticing my straining against the scarves, you lean forward to test the strength of the knots for yourself. As you lean over I lift my head from the pillow, meeting with success as I gently capture your nipple between my lips. Sucking as much of your breast into my mouth as I can. Yet, clearly having the advantage, you remove it from my mouth and sit back again. I drop my head to the pillow, sighing, frustrated, and again you simply smile.  You lean forward barely brushing my warm lips with your own, then quickly into a passionate kiss, our tongues gently touching, exploring each other. Pushing your thigh between my legs, your hands find my breasts again, caressing softly, fingers lightly tracing around each nipple. You lower your head, flicking one nipple with your tongue as you squeeze the other with your fingers. Your tongue trails over my body as you slide yourself down, kneeling near the end of the bed between my legs.  Ever so slowly you place your outstretched fingers on the tops of my thighs, stroking down lightly, tickling, teasing, your finger tips barely touching my skin. With each light stroke you move slightly in until you are brushing along my inner thighs. Instinctively I part my legs, opening myself up to you. You smile again as you can't help but notice how wet I am. You look up at me and see my breasts nearly heaving with every breath. Our eyes meet and you can see the pleading look on my face. Every touch of your fingers feels like fire dancing across my bare skin. I squirm, begging for your touch. I close my eyes, dropping my head back down to the pillow as I tremble in anticipation.  I want you to touch me, to taste me, anything to stop the merciless throbbing between my legs. Yet you wait. Finally as you lower your head I can feel your hot breath on my legs and the outer lips of my wet and waiting sex. My hands grasp the silk bonds pulling, straining, but I can't move closer to you. My legs open even wider and I unconsciously thrust my hips trying to make some sort of contact. With a little laugh you pull your head away prolonging the tease. I squirm and beg incoherently when at last I feel a soft wetness pushed between my lower lips. I nearly faint as all the nerves tingle through my body. Your tongue teasing gently, entering me, exploring.  An uncontrollable moan escapes my lips as you move your tongue up to tease my clit, and your fingers seek out my swollen lips. Moisture coats your fingers as you delve between the folds of soft skin. First one finger enters my body, then a second, stroking deeper, pumping slowly as you continue to flick your tongue across my clit. My hips thrust again bucking against your hand and mouth, I can't take this, I'm begging you to move faster ... harder ... deeper.  You lower your head sucking my clit into your mouth, running your tongue in circles around it, pumping furiously with your fingers deep inside me. A flush flows over my perspiration soaked body as my muscles contract. I hear a cry release, it is my own, as my back arches and my entire body spasms with pleasure.  I can barely breathe as you crawl back up to look me in the eyes. Lowering your face to mine you kiss me deeply. I can taste myself on your lips and tongue, but I don't mind. It only rekindles the fire....reminding me that soon I will be the one making you cry out in pleasure......if only I can get my hands free!

      After three days and two nights of sleeping and waking up with Steph in my arms, the bed now seems huge. It's cold and lonely and there is absolutely too much room to thrash around in the middle of the night. It hit me hard this morning when I woke up. Alone. And then again all day today when I only had people ranging in age from 3-12 to talk to. I was just getting reacquainted with actual adult conversation and suddenly I only have access to that over the phone. Again. It was sweet while it lasted. There will be more opportunities in the future for several days in a row of uninterrupted time together, but it is so hard to remember that when you wake up alone and the reality hits you smack in the face.

      My thoughts are all over the place tonight. I've got that here, there and everywhere thing going on inside my head. I'd be truly amazed if I could pin down one coherent thought and get it posted here. So, if this post gets a little wonky, don't say I didn't warn ya right there in the first couple sentences.  I'm thinking that a list is in order here, that way I don't have to come up with whole paragraphs of cohesive thought.    My eat less - move more plan has been working well. I've lost 12 lbs. and while that may not seem like a whole lot, I've gained muscle and lost fat. Yay!  I feel less cluttered since I cleaned out my blog. Now, if only I could do the same thing around the house...  The children go back to school in two weeks. I love them dearly, but I can hardly wait for them to get  the hell out of the house  back to all that important learning!  I probably shouldn't be sharing this, but I can't help it, I'm horny as hell.  That probably has a lot to do with the fact that I'll be seeing someone special very soon, and for more than just a few hours.  I'm feeling rather impatient about that.  How long until Friday? Come on Friday!  I've stopped thinking in sentences, I now have lyrics running through my head.  It's hard to write when your brain is singing.  Is it Friday yet?   That about sums it up for now. Or at least, that's all I can get down without breaking into some sort of song and dance routine. Maybe a song, I don't dance. Well, hardly ever. Steph dances. Sometimes she dances for me. But that's really a private matter, forget I said that. I'll blame that last sentence or two on the horny-ness factor. I really should stop typing now, before I get into trouble.

      I have to believe that some day this will all be easier.  Or better.  Or something.  That at some time we'll get all we want - all we need - from this relationship.  I have to believe it.  I have to believe that eventually we'll see each other more than we talk on the phone (instead of the other way around).  I have to believe that I'll be able to hold you in my arms all night instead of just a few hours.  That I'll make love with you all night instead of the hit-and-run sex we seem to have.  That we'll be able to take our time instead of watching the time.  I have to believe it or I think I'll lose my mind.  Or I may lose you.  Or maybe I'll just lose myself.  I have to believe.
