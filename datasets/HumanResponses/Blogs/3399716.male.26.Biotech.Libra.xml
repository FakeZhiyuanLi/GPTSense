       urlLink    Does anybody ever wonder what the future holds?? Ever worry about the future if everything is going to be ok? I often do... And it scares the shit out of me... How will my life be? Will I be living comfortably? Will I have kids, how many, will they all grow p to be successful? Will I be as a good father? As good as mine was? Who will be my wife? Is it the girl that I am with now (I sure hope so)? Will we be together forever? How about my job? Will it be the same? Will I ever get the PhD that I want? Where will I be living? Will I ever own a house like I always wanted to? Just the many questions that I sit and think about from time to time. I'm sure everyone thinks about their future.... And everyone worries like I do..... Some more so than others... The future what does it hold.... Only if I had a crystal ball which wasn't so damn cloudy all the time..... &nbsp; urlLink

Why can't have we have this much fun in this country without being censored..... Does anybody else notice that if Bush continues to be in office we are about to witness the demise of not only freedom of speech but a lot of other aspects that made this country "free".   a  &nbsp; urlLink

      Just saw Jeaux d'enfants (child's play in french) or the English title Love me if you dare....  It was pretty good, definitely recommend it....   more innocent people died today ....  a terrorist is a terrorist no matter if its a bomb strapped to person which kills innocent people or its from rocket killing innocent lives in a demonstration or in a wedding. or military personal humiliating prisoners. I thought we went there to stop that from happening.    a

      Microsoft pi$$es me off.   The way they have a monopoly on the whole computer software sector, what really pisses me off is that they know it and they are getting big headed and trying to bully themselves and have no appreciation for customer or the way their customer service is going, isn't that right Tom from Toronto?? And on top of the "first class" customer service they are trying to lure customers away from AOL to sign up to MSN... please... start from trying o understand the common man/woman first   on a totally different note....  have people tried out this gmail thing?? it is awesome... I'm glad to see email, or should we call it "GMAIL" from now on, is going into the right direction... it's not perfect but it's definitely in the right direction Google just revolutionized the email industry. and jeers to all the people who are crying foul and that it's a infringement on their privacy. PLEASE!!! you people act like that the people at google have so much time in their hands to sit there and read your emails and put ads up. GROW UP!! what makes you think that a person from AOL, MSN, HOTMAIL, or any run of the mill email server won't be able to do that? chances are the company that you work at scans your emails. Grow up people.. if you are worried about the government being able to scan your emails, then maybe they should be!! do you have something to hide??  anyways big cheers to google!! I wonder if they have a job for me!  till next time  a

      My first post....  this is kind of exciting......  I don't what I will be posting here... I guess it will transform into it's own as it progresses. Hopefully it'll turn out to be something interesting.  I will start out by something that is very interesting to me and that I believe in; which is getting GWB out of office come November. He is BAD!! Simply put.  So, Lieutenant, I was wondering, would you do me a favor?  Could you PLEASE do better than a ROSE BUSH?   I saw the guy on TV yesterday that your boys found, the Iraqi who said he had "planted" some nuclear plans in his "back yard" in Baghdad -- 12 years ago -- "under a rose bush."   Woo boy. That's a good one. Do you really think we are as dumb as we look? I know our fascination with "American Idol" and Scott Peterson may make us Americans look a little light in the head, but when it comes to lying to us to lead us into war, we really do demand a bit more of an EFFORT and a FOLLOW-THROUGH.   You see, George, it's not the lying and the doctoring of intelligence that has me all upset. It's that you've had control of Iraq for over two months now -- and you couldn't even find the time to plant just a few nukes or vats of nerve gas and at least make it LOOK like you weren't lying to us.   You see, by not faking some evidence of weapons of mass destruction, it shows that you thought no one would mind if it turned out you made everything up. A different kind of president, who believes that the American public would be outraged if they ever found out the truth, would go to great lengths to cover up his subterfuge.   Johnson did it with the Gulf of Tonkin. He said our ships were "attacked" by the North Vietnamese. They weren't, but he knew he had to at least make it LOOK like it happened. Nixon said he wasn't "a crook," but he knew that wasn't enough, so he paid hush money to the burglars and somehow had 18 1/2 minutes erased from a tape in the Oval Office. Why did he do this? Because he knew the American people would be pissed if they found out the truth.   ........   Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!   Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.   ---- But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!    ~Exert from A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush    ...to be continued... I don't intend for this to be a political bolg at all.... Just random thoughts from time to time... Which could get political... Comments are always welcomed!  until next time  a
