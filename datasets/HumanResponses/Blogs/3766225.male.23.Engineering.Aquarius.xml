      Everybody wants to be my friend, but here's comes the question: For what? What's the catch? There's always a catch. They tell me I am too easy with people, and I know they're right, but this is a thing I can't change. I am the kind of persons that just can't say  NO , and here's another problem I know yet I can't fix. I don't want to sound self-coincided, but I am a very smart person and I can do a lot of stuff (softwares, projects, etc..). Everybody around me knows this and they try to take advantage of my skills and make money without giving me what is rightfully mine. I can't resist and I have already mentioned why. So far, I haven't met someone whom I can call my friend. They say that they are my friends, well I say let them go to hell...None of them is a true friend...Everyone works for his best interest never thinking that this might hurt you in someway. Everybody just keeps asking me for favors and I always help, but when I ask for a favor regardless of how small or big it is, they start saying that they  might  do it but I am asking for too much and they can't offer that much help, and they're busy and stuff like that. What kind of friends are these people. I just can't imagine what they say behind my back about me or what the hell they think of me. You what I don't care, let them go to hell. Sometimes I feel like it's better for me just to go away probably to another country and create my own world there. Perhaps for now it's easier for me to create my own mysterious world that no one knows about and live inside it... Away from anyone...Away from the so called friends...Away from this ugly world...........

      Ok, so it seems that the previous post was not that interesting (I kind of agree). Here's something that I always research and hope to get an answer for it. Have you ever heard with Tele-kinesis or psycho-kinesis? I find this topic really cool even though most people are frightened from it. Some people believe that the devil has something to do with it or people possessing such power are possessed or use magic and other evil stuff. Other people believe that this is the power of mind over matter. I mostly like to go with the later belief since from what it says is interesting. I believe that the human mind has still undiscovered powers that we don't know how to use and it is capable of doing things that we yet don't understand (Astral projection and other stuff). I mean being able to control and move things by just looking at them (concept of tele-kinesis) seems weird to some people and might scare them away, but if I had such an experience, I would definitely try to explore it and go more deep into it... Well, I hope I'll be able to find out what this is all about soon....!
