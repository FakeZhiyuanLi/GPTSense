Ever have talks with your parents about sex? Hell no, they dont understand half of my emmense teenage lingo. 6. Do you think the color purple is Gay? Why not, Tinky-Winky is purple, and he can't be straight. 7. (men)&nbsp;Are breasts the first thing you look for in a woman? Damn Straight!! 8.

If you were stuck on a deserted island, what would you bring and why? I would bring a cell phone to get the hell off the damn island!  Thanx for playing!

        If I could describe LBA in three words, those words would be      it f***in rocked!  Furthermore,  our show encompassed the music of one of the best bands in the world - the Beatles. The crowd loved every minute of it and so did we; this is just a shout-out to all those who helped to make it a success!     &nbsp;  I'll Holla at ya L8er.

       Please anyone in Terrebonne High School's Marching Band save me from this torture! I am dealing with some of the worst musicians in my entire musical career! The music is cool, but some of the students attitudes are far from optomistic. Personally, I love the music, but then again what music don't I like, right?       Today was cool, simply because I got to order a whole lot of little sophomores around all day; I felt so powerful! The music is hard, but if (emphasis on "IF") the group gets it together, then it will be so awesome.      Terrebonne High School's "Sound of Pride" will sound like a marching orchestra when we get through teaching them what they gotta learn, ESPECIALLY THE WOODWIND SECTIONS!!!      I"ll Holla at ya L8er all my band peeps!

       Wow, who would have thought I would have something nice to say about band camp, other than that it is over today!? Actually, the band has somehow (I don't exactly know how) come together and is working very hard. The overall morale has increased dramatically, along with our progression with the show; we already have 3 of our 4 songs with movement on the field already.      Sadly, we are still losing people from our show; very important people I might add. My co-section leader is considering quitting so that she can do colorguard, but she won't be able to because     TRYOUTS WERE IN MAY; SHE CANT JOIN NOW!!!           Well, anyway, today went well, other than slight setbacks such as forgeting a set or missing a spot here and there.       I have to give a shout-out to all my '05 seniors out there who made this year's band camp a fairly successful venture:    GIVE IT UP FOR THE '05 SENIORS AT THS!!         H O L L A  A  T   Y A L 8 E R !!!

       Well, so far the band has detereorated more than composte in a fire, and quite quickly I might add. THAT IS SOOO DEPRESSING! Our band was supposed to be about 100 members strong, but sadly, half, or about half, of the members quit for THE STUPIDEST REASONS IMAGINABLE!!!    1. "THE SHOW WAS TOO HARD AND I DIDNT FEEL LIKE DOING IT."   2. "I JUST DONT LIKE MARCHING ANYMORE. SORRY."   3. "I'LL JUST COME BACK FOR CONCERT BAND, THEY DONT NEED ME RIGHT NOW ANYWAY."    AND THE LIST GOES ON FOREVER. As long as I am breathing and living, I will not stand for anymore of this foolish "i'm gonna leave cause its too hard" bullshit! Our show is suffering because of a few measly lazy bums who never had to work this hard and can't put forth any effort, and I'm REALLY SICK OF IT!    KATE, if you comment on this, I would really appreciate you emmensly. Oh and by the way, I need my copy of Finale back; my computer rebooted itself and I need to reinstall it right away.     THANKS!   (ANYONE WHO FEELS THE SAME WAY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON THIS SITUATION)    Holla at ya L8er!

        Wow, summer has really gone by fast this year; I've had a really great time this summer doing everything I wanted to do and meeting some interesting people.     I just wanted to reflect on the goings-on of my summer, due to the fact that I don't get out much so I am a poor person to have a conversation with so, here we go:     1. I was honored to recieve a nomination for Who's Who in American High School Students.     2. I participated in a downtown play at La Petit Theatre De Terrebonne (orchestra was the Shizznit!)     3. I had the pleasure (yeah, right.) of being a drill seargent in our band camp at Terrebonne High.     4. I assisted my sister in being published in the International Society of Poets' newest volume of poetry,   Tracing the Infinite  ,  which she won a plaque for most outstanding poet 13 and older.     5. Of course, I have to talk about  LBA , one of the greatest congregations of musicians I have ever had the pleasure of attending.    And thats about it.     As you can see, my life is filled to the brim with social activities, which I would like to thank a few people for showing to me:         Kate and Brett , thank you for being such intelligent people and . . . well . . .just being all around cool people; I really appreciate you guys emmensely.                   L8ter Peeps!
