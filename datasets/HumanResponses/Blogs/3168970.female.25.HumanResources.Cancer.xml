      Wow what a long day. Amazingly im not tired...Didn't get all that much sleep last night but not having to sleep alone was well worth it!!  Was real nice to see Gary,I felt like I hadn't seen him for days. I thought sex was the best we have had...Was awesome. If I could make him cum it would be tons better though. I think once I finaly figure out what he really loves it should be easy...Its just getting there is harder than I thought. I get nervous and axious around him alot...I hate that feeling. im guessing its because I've been with only one other person for the last year and im just so unaccustomed to being around anyone else in bed or out. Cant wait for that feeling to go away. Kids are going to chris's tonight. They are so excited,they haven't seen him in over a month. Almost tempted to see if Gary will stay with me again but not sure how much time either one of us are willing/wanting to devote to whatever it is we are doing. Got my hours for may today OMG they suck...Every sat and sun on assited side...Haven't seen my special care hours yet . I would much rather be over there. I don't see why im not all the time because I seem to be the only person who likes it and is willing to do everything that's required. I have to check out some daycares tomorrow. I think id rather pay more and just not have to deal with crazy lady all the time. She just doesn't go away. Shit drew just dumped a thing of powder sugar candy on the floor........Great... That stuff never goes away. fun stuff....

      had to have a new fresh box...more cheerful! today im pretty content and happy...wich is strange considering whats been going on. i think ive made choices that are good for me and im realizing that i can live with them this time !!!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!  plus i get to see gary tonight and thats always a great thing. i always feel good with him...i can say anything and be any kind of way and he's cool with that. its awesome! he is the breath of fresh air i always need but never take. ive never felt so easily connected to someone so fast before. the first time we talked he made me feel relaxed. i always try to keep my distance because i have strange feelings i havent experienced before with him and its a little scary....dont really know how to deal with them. cant say im in love with him but im sure its not just casual sex with a friend either. dont know and really dont care at this point. ive always held back something with him and it doesnt feel right so im just going to take it for what it is and let whatever happens happen and stop trying to alter my feelings about it. drew is going nuts in the house so im going to mow the lawn and then we are going to have lunch with our fruitcake of a neighbor and maybe hit the park for a bit and wear this kid out!

      anyway...he is being weird because he knows im freakin...says he didnt sleep with anyone. i dont believe that for a sec. i tell him i just cant take this anymore im falling apart. he says we need to take a breather  and that he wants me to be ok blah...fuck that. so i take his car back at 500 and we try to talk but get nowhere...just as i expected...he wont talk about the night before says its irrelevent wich is his way of saying he fucked up. i cant even say anything at this point im so overwhelmed with everything. he says he's leaving me beecause he treats me like shit and its not fair to me and that he is so stressed out right now he is not acting like himself. i couldnt say anything just sat there and was like whoa...wtf......at least i get satisfaction from him admiting finally that he is wrong and ill i have done is try to get us going in the right direction. i was just so numb i didnt cry or freak out i just got up and left. we still havent talked i dont think i have anything left to say except for a big fuck you for mind fucking me for the last year....im depressed but kinda happy. relieved because i knew it was comming. i havent felt close to him for weeks now. i feel a little empty, almost like comming down from a high. im not sure who i am anymore he has changed me so much. been thinking alot lately of silly little things that i just didnt have with him....i miss thoses things so much its crazy. i havent been doing what i want ot be doing because of the control he has had over me. i have never been like this before and i hop ei never am again. i guess i should just be thankful  for everything i am taking away from all of this....made me grow as a person big time. never knew such extreme highs and lows exsisted. im sure i will be more cautious as to what i do now and who i do it with wich may not be good because i always was before all this but everything i have taken for granted before has become all the more real and in my face and ill make sure to take the time and live life like i should be rather than for someone else.  god that hurts.......hard to let that out..draining...makes it hurt fresh like it was just an hour ago. sad really but i imagine this will take quite awile to be completly easy to think of ar talk about. i really need to make myself limit where i go and who i talk to for awile...it sucks to let him restrict in a way what i do but moving on is so much harder when we have any kind of contact. im thinking of getting a new unlisted number or maybe just re-reading this when he calls and says what i crave to here as a reminder of what will happen if i go back...seriously how many times can i do this to myself?

      Ugh...im soooo sleepy...Need a nap. That's not going to happen. Today sucks. Lots of sstupid little things are annoying me. wade is in seattle and i have not heard a thing from him all day...thats strange and a little concerning considering last time he was in seattle he was with some stupid bitch and being a complete fucker. I was all excited to read garys updated blog today and oohhhhh its not there...Wonder if he made it private. That's to bad,I really was enjoying reading his thoughts. It was very well written and insightful. Drew is being a punk today....I think he is sleepy too. Im thinking about letting the kids skip school on Monday and going to the zoo. We haven't been for ages and that's my only day off. They would love that. I think tami is pissed at me because I got her job. She hasn't called in days...That's not like her. Oh well she could have kept it if she wanted to. Im slacking today...Need to go get dinner and do 50 n 50 and play with kids for a bit before bedtime. Tomorrow has to be better...Its Friday!!

      So I finely decided to go back to work,was getting bored at home...Not enough adult interaction I think. IM sure IM going to be hating life for the next week or so until I get myself used to going to bed like a normal person and waking up at 5. My kids are thrilled...They LOVE their babysitter,that makes it a lot easier to leave them. The only real issue I have is the constant thought that now wade has Jill free weekend nights and I just cant seem to trust him enough to not stress about that. I can just see him using that as an excuse to go fuck someone....Hopefully IM wrong but we'll see. He has been really grumpy and standoffish lately. I try to understand that its because of how things are going with his company but damn...I have been going out of my way to make sure his house is clean and laundry is done and that hayden is happy...i have even been cooking...ha ha  Hopefully he figures something out soon so we can go back to being us. I havent really talked to gary since the weekend. kinda starting to miss him a bit. I need to try to make sometime to see him this week. Not sure what it is but i just cant stay away from the guy. we always have tons of fun when we do get together...he always cheers me up.

      How perfectly wonderful...A nice quiet place to spill my guts. This is sad really. I have never really understood the point of things like this. Why in the worls am I going to waste time writing about events I already had to go through? I guess that why im here,to find out...Pessimistic..Yah yah I know. im sure it could be worse though. Not alot happened today that is even worth repeating...hmmm lets see took the kidos to school and went tanning this morning. Now tanning always brightens up even the gloomiest of days for me. For one its warm and relaxing...For two there's just something about being all warm and naked and all oiled up that just gets me going,cant help it. Today it was easy to come up with a perfect masturbation fantasy...mmmmm drunk weekend sex!!!Something about intoxicated sex with some nice all night snuggles after just warms my insides...im just not getting enough cuddle time lately so I seem to be getting all mushy and girlie alot. That's going to have to stop!! Talked to Maria after that.Thank god I was already satisfied or I might have been tempted by her offer to come entertain me tonight. Something about her just gets to me and its not just that she's dumb as freaking earthworm. She's clingy and possessive and just doesn't comprehend the fact that I don't really like girls all that much..For play sometimes yes but  ugh...I don't want to keep them. Picked drew up and we went to wendys and had lunch..Gross but he loves it. We had been home for about an hour when the power started to flicker...It made the weird surging noise again so IM betting some jackass hit a generator again. I swear that happens once a month here. Must be something in the water.

      im bored and lonely. not a good combination...drives me to call someone just to have arms around me all night...to not have to wake up alone...mmmmmm lovely thoughts.  im not even sure if i could do that as good as it sounds. i would end up feeling like some snakey man pig. to late to call gary anyway. dont think he'd want to drive out here right now and im not even sure if he even wants to talk to me. cant really ever tell what he really thinks or is feeling. i have such a strange thing for him...sometimes i just want to let myself fall crazy in love with him and then something happens to bring me back to realistic land and im ok for awile. strange stuff. i bought some cute little mice today...not sure why,just an impulse i guess. my kids were thrilled until i let drew hold one and the little fucker took a bite outa his finger. guess they are mice to watch not touch...took drew to the dr. today for his 5 year check up. poor guy had to get 4 shots. ouch!! he didnt cry or complain at all. what a trooper! had to go get ice cream after that and of course ended up coating his carseat in a sticky white glaze. i hate taking that thing apart to wash it. god my mom is calling again. she always calls more when im going to see her soon. like 2 weeks with her and my step family is not bad enough..yuck

      fuck fuck fuck  lmao  nice...Didn't realize I've been disconnected from the net for quite so long...Guess it was easy to live without. Life has been pretty trite lately all having to do with the fact that I've cut off all socialization with almost everyone I know. I just get this way sometimes. im sure its not very healthy but I just don't give one bit of a fuck. I have seen my old friends quite a lot in the last few weeks. The anniversary of gils death was last week. We all met at the cemetery as promised. Sometimes I miss him so much I cant breathe,or don't want to maybe. Other times I get so pissed at him for leaving me I want to go jump on him. I went for a few months of counseling to try and deal with all of my issues surrounding him and they said this was all normal when you loose someone who has taken part in almost ever major aspect of your life. Its like a third of my life pie is missing sure this is part of the reason for my disassociation with life lately. I have made small efforts to see Gary but it always seems that when I get any kid and work free time he is busy already. I had the strongest urge to see him a few weekends ago that I just drove to clackamas without calling him to surprise him but he was busy. Bad luck I guess. I was just starting to feel like we were good together, well as good as one can be while having a sexual relationship and the this whole trust issue came about. I tried to be understanding about it all. Our opinions about trust are worlds apart. To me I have to have that. Its the most important thing to me and I will completely without a doubt give someone IM close to that until they show me its not deserved. Sad thing is he thinks I lied about something completely stupid that has no bearing on either of our lives. Guys cheat...They just do..You cant stop them. I understand his feelings on it but I really doubt him knowing is going to change anything at all. Its sad people do that to the ones who love them.

      I did it again... Said something that didn't need to be said in the first place and to the wrong person on top of that. I told Gary that Ryan cheats on his wife . I thought he knew that..Or maybe I just never thought about it. Guys are a strange breed they always seem to think it just fine for them to cheat on gf's or wives but if one guy catches another guys wife cheating he is the first to run and tell. I guess that's not the case here. I feel so bad for stressing Gary out and putting him in a place like that but theres nothing I can do about it now. I swear I should just stay away from him....I just seem to cause him problems and he deserves to find a nice girl and have a good relationship. Sleeping with me isn't going to get him very far in that direction. im very much not relationship material....Or not his kind anyway. I saw wade last night. It went pretty good I thought. The kids were there...I wasn't expecting that but it was real good to see them. Hung out with them for a bit and had a glass of wine with wade and talked a little. Was nice to just talk about non-sense everyday stuff instead of our drama. Hayden asked if I was still taking him to chuck e cheese. That put me on the spot so I told him that if its all good with his dad I will take all the kids next week on a day when wade has a late meeting. Heather even said she would go witch is weird. Don't know how healthy it is for the kids to keep seeing each other but I already had promised them. I have been antsy all day waiting for the doctor to call....Nothing yet. Just have to know so I can stop freaking. Guess I should go to the store soon...Out of almost everything. I need beer...Better yet I should stop being a stress cadet and quit drinking. Ha ha  that wont happen but it was a nice thought for a sec at least.

      Went to the Dr. Today..Ugh I despise doctors. Should have results within 48 hours. I feel just fine so hopefully im all good. Tired of being stressed about it. So I guess im going to have to suck it up and go get my stuff from wades tonight. ive put it off long enough. I just know it wont be easy and I don't want to do anything stupid. He has asked to see me the last few nights and ive been as honest and open as I can about why I just cant see him. I think it is actually encouraging him when I say no. Like he didn't ever think I would actually say something and mean it. fuck I have to get rob out of here. He is driving me crazy...Cant deal with him for more than a day. Plus I kinda get the feeling he is here to try and scam on me more than be here for drew. Never happen yuck!!

      So I think my life is lacking something or maybe im just lonely. lonely in the sense of lacking someone in my life with whom to share intimacies even if they are only the mudane details of living. Just don't know anymore. Wade keeps calling and sending text. I don't know why its so hard to tell him no. I guess he didn't believe me when I said the next time he broke up with me I would not come back. im freakin hungover and being such a bitch today. It sucks. Need to call Gary and make nice for being quiet and a little grumpy this morning. I swear I thought I was going to puke the whole way home. Went to get a tatt today but they didn't have time. I have appt Thursday @ 4 cant wait...Ive been antsy to get another for awhile. Its so addictive, I need to set a limit and stick with it before I cover my whole body. Better go get the kids to bed I didn't realize it was getting so late.

      ya know I seriously think hate sex is the most rockin kind of sex there is certainly my most memorable. Possibly more feeling expressed in that than in lovey sex. im a hater today for reasons I don't even care to type. Guys fuckin suck and all I want to end today is a deep sweaty nasty hate fuck. I want to be so fufilled and worn out that I cant do anything after but fall asleep covered our sweat and his cum.

      So today wade calls and doesn't even say hi before he asks me to go to Toronto with him for my birthday. I think I didn't even say anything for over a minute. Was just weird and my brain overloaded so fast that I couldn't think. Why would I want to go to a long boring Microsoft conference for 5 days for my birthday? It would cost him over 1200$ just for me to attend a conference in which I have no interest in anyway. And that's not counting my airfare and all that good junk. Did he even think before he asked? I doubt it. 5 days of me whinny and bitchy and bored......Fun stuff!!! It would be like taking my kids to the art museum for a day...fuck that

      Just typed for 20 fucking min and deleted it......FUCK....Long day did a lot of bitching at work and all in all got alot accomplished. Lets see...Hired 2 girls to train before the weekend..Got the maitnence man building some flower boxes so we can plant some stuff..Got a bunch of arts and craft stuff so my lady's don't just sit around all day anymore. Took kid's shopping for summer stuff. erika picked all pink(blah) of course. Drew wants his ears pierced all of a sudden...Have to think about that one for a bit. I fucking despise bathing suit shopping! Hate it! Hate it!...Nothing fits right..fuck being a chick. If I was a sea cow id have plenty of choices...Who the fuck wants to see a 200 pound chick in a string bikini........Nice. Oh well,guess its good thing I don't like water all that much. What else am I missing here...Oh ya my Gary withdrawals....I keep catching myself thinking about him at the strangest times and I get these crazy urges to just go to hop on him and have rough crazy nasty all about me sex and then leave right after we're done...Just to fufill my own wants and needs. Something about being sexually selfish it hot to me. Even just seeing him for 5 min or long enough to get his cum in my mouth then leaving would keep me satisfied for days. Saying all this ive really been trying to keep my distance from him lately. I've come to the conclusion that sleeping with him is where I went wrong which is really stupid of me considering I knew I was wrong doing it the whole time. Sleeping is one of those lovey intimate things you just don't do with anyone..Well in my mind anyway...

      U know I really fucking cant stand people who completely go off about something crazy stupid just because they had a bad day or something is not going right for them. Why waste so much energy freaking out about nonsense that really has no immediate effect or impact on your life...i mean does that really make you feel better?? i doubt it...Save all that bitching up for something really worth getting worked up about.

      i think i need more sleep or maybe more days off. i just spaced out while driving and hit the car in front of me. just a tiny bump but still. sooo glad i wasnt drinking! chris decided to keep the kids so im on my own again. kinda nice sometimes. i think im going to go out for awhile and go in an hour late tomorrow. im sure they wont say to much. ive already put in almost 60 hours this week and i still have tomorrow to go. i better go shower and do laundry before i get unmotivated.

      God I must be bored...No kids no brother. This doesn't happen to often. kinda nice to sit around and do nothing half naked! Was thinking about going out but cant be bothered to even try to shower and put on clean clothes. Today has just been strange..Think its ex bf day or something...Got two dreaded ex calls and asked out by the freaking paramedic that always comes in response to my 911 calls. Just thought it was a little strange for him to be scaming right after packing up a half dead lady with blood spewing out of her nose...Nasty. im sure he will try again,I showed to much hesitation when he asked for my number. hhmmmm hot guy that lives and works close to me= dating drama I don't need. Oh so optimistic I am !!!!I only seem to be looking at the shitty side of things lately. fuck it. Just not so much into climbing back into the dating wastelands yet. Been fucked over enough to last a lifetime. I may have caused a good bit of it by not having the know how to exit a going nowhere relationship gracefully but hey live and learn. So I got approved for a 20,000 loan for a car but haven't even gone to look and see what they have. My car is so beyond ghetto I have to do something before its not drivable anymore. Almost bought an awesome Lexus but backed out at the last second. Got nervous about spending so much on a car I guess. Well that and it was to trendy snob like for me. I need something I can get filthy and thrash on. im tempted to put an engine in my explorer. I could get so much air in that thing even the guys were impressed. It took some serious beatings when we lived on the mountain. Speaking of mountain..Still undecided about moving back. I hate it here but I started to hate it there also. For someone who despises change so much I sure like to move a lot. I think its just daily routine change that makes me anxious. hmm maybe im just a freak. That sounded so weird. i like things all safe and comfortable feeling i guess. damn typing kinda sucks when my finger is a bit swollen and sore. better go get something to eat before im to tired.

      Oh it feels like Friday...im so fuckin burnt out with work. Sunday afternoon I left early and got a call at 7 saying that my favorite resident was in ICU due to the HCC not doing 15 min checks. Poor Patsy fell outside and had a heart attack then laid there roasting in the sun for at least 2 hours. Disturbing to say the least. We are now under serious investigation. God fuck that. How can someone be so careless when dealing with peoples lives? On top of work drama I spent sun and mon being an emotional freak. Don't know what happened but I was a mess. Had a huge Gary hang up...I should have realized this but didn't Tel just in 1 unexpected sec I got thoses creepy tingles on sat when we were at sandlake. It was like one of thoses things your brain just cant register at first and you just want to shake your head to see if the thought stays. Wow....After hanging out and being cool for this long realizing that I might actually feel a little more than lust for him was crazy. I seriously didn't expect that. ive always had something for him but I thought it was just that I feel like he fills some of the empty space I have had since gill died. We seem to compliment each other in our likes and tastes and I could always picture us being great friends for a long time. I can say anything to him. I like that easy feeling. Its hard to find. Well for me anyway. Im not very comfortable with a lot of people though he has lotsa great qualities still he is not my type, not my kind of boyfriend material..He's to young for me...I think it may have just been a weird freak thing. Once I stopped and thought about how crazy all this was I felt better. I think I really stressed him out being psycho chick for a bit there. We are having almost like fake forced conversations now...Really sucks. I feel bad but no taking it back now. im not good at hiding things from people but it may have been better in this case. im pretty sure he thinks that if he sees me ill continue to be girly and weird and I don't think reassuring him that I wont will get me very far but im done stressing about it. Lets see...Hung out with cj for a bit yesterday. Was an ok time but just like rob to much of him just annoys me. (just being honest cj sorry) we had a few beers and talked about E and his court stuff. Hope that all works out for him in the end. He really doesn't deserve everything that bitch has put him through. Heather has watched the kids for the last couple days and she is a kickass babysitter!! Love her! Much better than shaunna, not that that takes much...I hate stupid people so much. fuck its all about common sense....Ok enough of that I don't want to get into bitch mode. Had an amazing tanning session today...mmmmmm I have a new erotic hot thought that just makes me crazy wet....

      Waited so long to do this im having trouble remebering the week...I saw Gary Wednesday and Thursday,has been nice to see so much of him in the last couple Weeks sex of course!! I think we need to be more careful though,seems to me like we are getting closer. Friday after work me and this kids hung out for a bit then I went to dinner with sandy and her husband. Was good to see them. They seem to be doing much better than before. hmmm...After that I went to scottys...Biggest dump around but I love it there. Wade and Jason and their friends were there.i was a bit surprised to see them. I also saw Jason(net manager from Lexus)there.i only planed on having a couple beers but ended up with a couple pitchers in me. Wade asked me to go somewhere else with him to hang out so I went. We got along great. Didn't expect that at all. I was sure we would be fighting after an hour. It was nice to see him but probaly not worth investing any time in. He is moving and would treat me the same way there that he does here and I'd be stuck there with no friends and 4 kids. blah. Ok on to better things!! Saturday!!! Wow it had to be the best day ivy had all year! Went to sandlake with Gary for the day. It was awesome. I had so much fun I was wishing we could have gone for the whole weekend. Now I understand why he was so anxious to go. I really like that about him. He gets so passionate about everything. Saying all that he did seem a little weird when he dropped me off and I haven't heard from him since then....Don't know why I stress about him so much,im not like that. I guess if he's hating on me ill hear about it soon enough. i really hope not.i have been feeling good about us lately.

      Ugh what a night..Was all worked up to go see Gary when erika says her throat hurts. That's never good with her because when she gets any kind of sick it always goes to extreme sick real fast. Poor girl. In 2 hours she couldn't swallow or talk so off to the ER we go. By now they know her name and birthdate and all that good stuff by heart...Make its easier and faster I suppose. They gave her another big does of steroids and she was much better in 2 hours. That usually does the job and shies back to school the next day but obviously not this time. She was up at 5am worse off than yesterday. I cant even see down her throat. I called the Dr and he said tylenol and antibiotics and she should be feeling better soon so I gave her those and went to work. Babysitter called at 715 freaking out. She said erika was burning up and that she couldn't see down her throat. I think I got home in about 4 min. Its not quite as bad as babysitter made it sound but still not good. Im taking her back to the Dr at 9 and hopefully they can get her better fast with out another hospital trip. I really feel bad now for leaving her today. I should have just called in sick....being a mom is hard sometimes.

      im such a slacker when it comes to this the time I finaly get around to posting I cant even remember wtf I did the last week. didnt have much of a weekend but didn't really care after Thursday night. Gary came over and we had perfectly amazing sex,the best we have had in my opinion. He seemed more relaxed and I know I was and for the first time he didn't seem to be completely concentrating on getting me off. Made a big difference. Didn't realize how much I had missed him until I saw him and he touched me. All I could think of was getting him in my bed next to me fast. I wasn't planning on him staying the night,was actually against it but once he was with me I didn't want him to go,all I could think of was falling asleep next to him. Had to be up at 530..That sucked. Didn't have time to shower so I got to work walking funny smelling of sex and liquor. My boss asked me if I was drunk at 6am.. Nice.. Had to put on some lotion and eat a lot of mints. erika is home sick today and in her bed being a drama queen so I better go get her better so she doesn't miss the last 2 days of school. Ill be back to finish tonight....I hope

      Ok im so used to being way to busy that I have no idea what to do with myself today...Drew and I have spent the morning laying in bed watching cartoons...Fun stuff...Gary took a sick day but is off doing boy stuff..Understandable but kind sucks because it quite rare for us to both be off on the same day. Maybe ill try to take a Sunday off and see if Chris can take the kids. Drew is going to Minnesota for 12 days next month and I think erika will be with her dad so I should have a substantial amount of kid free time. I get excited for it every summer but when it comes down to it after 2 days I miss them so much I want them to come home. I think this year I may fly to Georgia for a couple days while they are gone to see shane and maybe visit Diane. Haven't seen her in ages. Our birthdays are all right around the time I would be there...Didn't think of that before. shanes is the 5th mine is the 10th and hers is the 11th. Ill have to call and make sure shane is back from Spain then, he said the end of June but you never know with him. Its been another year apart so I think everything between us should go a lot smoother than last year. Things got a little rough after 3 days together. Being wasted the whole time didn't help things im sure. Talked to wade about heather again today. She seems to be doing much better now. I told him she would be way more receptive to an adult who wasn't her parent and for once I was right. I was a little hesitant about her watching drew but it seemed to go perfect. Drew was happy and clean when I got there. She spent time with him and seemed to enjoy it. Its sad to think a 14 year old takes better care of my kids than their 28 year old babysitter who is making almost 1000 a month. God fuck that stupid slut. I cant wait to tell her to fuck right off. What a waste of day Im going to pack drew up and head to the mountain to look for houses,im so sick of it here.

      wow i slept in. i feel like complete shit now but at least i slept more than 5 hours for once. tried real hard to stay up last night waiting for kids to go to sleep so i could see gary but i always seem to fall asleep waiting. i want to see him now! its been way to long. he has been in my head alot these last few days. i had an awesome dream about him thought, so sleeping wasnt all that bad. we must have been at a hotel because we were in a huge bathtub. it was a little bit romantic and lovey. the water had baby oil and roses petals in it so the water was glistening all over our bodies in the perfectly erotic way with petals stuck here and there. was very hot! everything he did was amazing, i swear i was dripping wet when i woke up. it was almost in slow motion and it seemed soooo very real. i was so sure i really felt him bending me over and running his hands up and down my slick back before he slipped inside me. mmmmmmm i think it was so hot it has relieved some of my sexual frustrations.

       yay the little asshole is moving!!! I came home from work on Friday to my daughter crying because she is not allowed to play with her friends anymore because her uncle is a drunk freak...I was so pissed. im past even caring what my mom and dad think about all this so I told him he has the weekend to pack and leave. fuck him im so done taking care of him. My dad is not speaking to me and my mom is almost to that point. Both are feeling bad for him like always. They are just encouraging him to use drugs and drink his life away never knowing responsibility. Why would they want to do this? Oh well...We are better off without all of them. After all the drama dies down im sure I will have a lot less stress and be happier. So that's one nasty issue taken care of..... Had today off but went in for a bit anyway..Of course...Might go back tonight for awhile too. I have been spending way to much on non sense and not really realizing how many bills I have. Need to do a little damage control before it gets to be to much. Want to see Gary badly but have been avoiding it because I don't want to dump all my stress and drama on him. I feel like that's all we talk about when he calls lately. Doesn't seem fair. oohhh just thought of this...im sure ill get to see him a lot more now that I can actually have babysitter come over. tami wouldn't stay here when I was gone because Tony was such a dick to her. Very nice!!!

        wow today just wont end fast enough...My babysitter quit..My brother wont move out...Something wrong with my car.. My other car is getting towed if I don't move it by 10 tomorrow and I wouldn't care so much if there wasn't a tow bill and ticket attached to that....My mom is still here and is bitching about everything......I took the kids swimming yesterday and didn't get enough sun screen on drew so he has a nasty sunburn on his back...I feel so bad for the poor guy,there's not much I can do for him. I did go buy lots 50spf waterproof sunblock so I can soak him in it next time he is out in the sun. Today I just want to buy and suv pack some shit and the kids and drive Tel I cant anymore. Everytime everything seems to be getting good stupid shit happens. I need to live away from my family and out of the ghetto for starters. AND im freaking lonely. I don't want to sleep alone. I don't want to be pissed off alone. Sometimes I just want to know there's someone who will just tell me its ok and pet my hair while I lay in their lap and fall asleep tell today goes away.

        friday     so friday night i agreed to go out with some weirdos from work against my better judgement...wasnt quite as bad as i thought but i can do with out experiencing this again...after an hour i was bored out of my mind and started making excuses to leave..annmarie had a blind date at 8 so she left with me so she would have time to stop at o'brians and have a beer with me before she met up with creepy stranger guy...lmao her date called and cancelled and she was all upset about it so i told her she could just hang out with me the rest of the night...wow...now this girl is 33 and prety bland at work...i figured i would freak her out by drinking to much and being obnoxious...not the case...she got wasted like real wasted and told me that she liked me....uuummm wtf...wasnt sure if she met like me in a weird chick dating way(not my thing) or like me naked kind of like me..this is my boss we are talking about..weird and a bit creepy to say the least..we hooked up with a bunch of friends after this strange conversation and i was a bit less tense and alot more drunk...i gave in to shots after all this..big mistake...to cut it short we ended up making out like crazy in the middle of a bar...very interesting night...       &nbsp;   saterday     yeah im seriously hungover and its roasting hot...nasty...i slept most the day away..got dressed around 2 and went to a movie and fridays for dinner...and then back to bed...what a waste of day...       &nbsp;   sunday     im feeling a bit better today..just a touch of hangover still present...locked my keys in my car friday so i have to deal with this today before i get the kids...picked up erika and then rob and we took the kids to the carnival...ugh i hate crowds...the assholes closed the rides last night so my kids were a bit upset...annmarie met us there and walked around with us for awhile...she was freaking a bit and kept asking if i was feeling weird around her...i wasnt at all..i thought she would be though...so im hooking her up with a blind date and she said i should get a date and come to...that sounded cool enough&nbsp;to me so i agreed and asked gary if he would go with...he says no...he said he didnt want to meet my kids dad....i asked chris if that would be a normal guy response and he said because we have been close friends for the last 7 years it just seems ok to me and im not looking at it from garys point of view...yeah yeah i get it but i wasnt saying oh hey come meet my kids dad because i want something serious with you..wasnt like that at all....chris has met a few guy frinds of mine and it was all cool...we have nothing for each other..we are just friends hanging out...so anyway this leaves me having to scrounge up some kinda guy date to hang out for a couple hours...i said i would go and i dont want to back out but im for sure not going alone...im realizing that there are not many guys that i can stand hanging out with in a bar that i dont want to punch in the eye in the first 5 minutes&nbsp; ...fuck thats the last thing i need...i have a couple days ill figure something out...

        im going absolutely insane, i swear to god...im nuts...wade asked me what i thought of getting married and moving away and having more money than i ever dreamed of in exchange for being a faithful trophy wife who stays at home with the kids and cleans house and shit...maybe not in those exact words but holy shit!!!!!!! what the fuck!!!!!! im thinking that he is just testing the waters before he buys a ring...i think i forgot to breathe for a good minute...i said i dont know what to say to you right now and i left...a bit rude but god...i would have jumped at the chance of anything with him a few months ago but things are diffrent now. it only gets worse...my sweet and near perfect ex from about 3 years ago starts texting me out of the blue today...just fyi we broke up nice and neatly and stayed friends after he asked me to marry him and i told him i wasnt in love with him...he is awesome and easy for me to talk to so i called him because my mind was just spinning with to many thoughts to sort out alone..he knew in a sec something was wrong so i spilled it...he says even considering doing this would be settling becuase i dont want to go through the dating prosess over and over untel i find "the one" if that even exists...he know that being loaded and spoiled forever would just annoy me and that i really dont give a shit about all that...he tried that route. so he says he misses me every day i have been gone and asks me to come back to him...get married ...have a baby...blah blah blah....omg what is wrong with people...obviously this is the last thing i need and i cant tell if he is even being serious....like hey this girl is stressed so i might as well take my chance now......fuck today and fuck guys....so while im being a complete stress cadet i just decide that now is a great time to tell gary i think im in love with him....he says ok......ha ha ha ok....its far from ok but take it how you want buddie....at least he didnt give me any shit about it...yet.....sometimes i have no idea what posseses me to say the things i say...its like i just cant hold things in like normal people...i think its time to take a few weeks and be completely antisocial......

         oohhhh got my sun yesterday...Very nice tan lines on my ass I might add. Obviously the first part of the day went well considering I didn't do shit. im laying outside covered in oil and a bit buzzed thinking of all the nasty things im going to do with Gary that night and my mom comes out and says she cant watch the kids...blah blah blah...She is having some kind of drama with her nasty pig husband again...Can we say divorce??? Anyway she finally agrees but for 2 hours...That's 90 min of driving and only 30 min with him..Very shitty...Now normally I really don't care if she watches them or not...I don't ask her very often but this time I asked her way in advance and got myself all wound up about seeing him so I was a bit put out. So much in fact that I almost drove the kids to their dads an hour away at 8pm. If he wouldn't have been at work I would have. So im sure Gary is raging pissed at me again...I would be surprised if he didn't talk to me for a bit...I have yet to call and explain myself...I already feel bad enough. Back to my mom...Last year she asked me on very short notice to move into her house so she could move to Maryland to marry the maggot...I wasn't thinking I guess because I felt bad for her and agreed. Not thinking of how much I hate Dundee and how many times I have already moved away from here. So last night I Tel her that ive been looking at houses on the mountain and that I'd like to move back there....She freakin flips out...Just drama...Its like talking to a 16 year old. She gives me a huge guilt trip and on and on...Just what I expected. God forbid I&nbsp;don't live my life to make hers nice and fluffy...She is so sheltered and babied she has no fucking clue what life really is. Makes me glad my life was hard in the past and that I've gone through things people only read about...im to a point where I can deal with just about anything now and nothing shocks me..Plus I know for sure that I don't need a man to make my life run smooth. Sometimes its nice to think about all that husband taking care of me shit but im not sure its for me. So at about 11 I have a headache from listening to her ,im stressed about Gary hating on me...More than I should be considering he is only my sport sex..And missing him at the same time. So then my drunken brother shows up with a few friends and my mom goes to bed (his friends scare her) and we sit around outside drinking tell they get to loud and I send them off to lumpys to end their night...My family sucks

        been slacking a bit the last few days ...no time to update really. thursday i had to go get wade from the airport his flight was due at 10pm but didnt arrive until 1:15 am...omg what a long boring wait!! i got in a few shots at the airport bar before they closed at 11...what a bunch of shit why cant they stay open til 2?&nbsp; so after this im a bit buzzed and that must be noticable because about 5 older married buisness men take their turns trying to pick me up over the next two hours...not to much fun. wade felt bad for keeping me waiting for so long so he asks me to dinner the following night. keep in mind i had a couple beers and 4 shots on an empty stomach so of course i say yes. so we get in the car and he tosses me a little red box.....im thinking oh fuck....but it was all good it was just a watch. was quite surprised that he got me something...very unexpected.&nbsp;      &nbsp;   on to friday...get up at 5 after 3 hours of sleep so the day really didnt start off to hot. get text from gary...he is going camping and asks me if i want to go,now this sounds great but even if i could get the days off i dont think alot of time together would be real benificial for us at this point. im really not sure what we are doing anymore..i think its obvious on both of our parts that we are not just fuck buddies anymore but i dont think either one of us wants to pursue anything more than that at this point so it kind of leaves us at a uncomfortable in-between spot.&nbsp; so after work i go home to get all cleaned up and ready for my not sure what to call it so we can call it a date. im not sure what to wear because he didnt say where we were going. im really hoping he will base that choice on what im wearing because i cant stand going to stuck up yuppy places. just fyi im wearing a cute blue little skirt and a tight white t-shirt..nothing to fancy. he takes me to my favorite irish pub and wouldnt you know about 20 of his friends are there....UGH...no no no&nbsp; i hate people i have to be fake with..i dont know them and im quite anti social&nbsp; so really its not a good situation. so what do you do in a position like that.....oh yeah...i got wasted&nbsp;. was a bit more social after 5 memosas and a few beers. i was drunk enought to go to mixers and cause a scene....i hate this place and avoid it like the plauge but for some drunken reason i thought it was a great idea. of course it sucked and i got plenty of drama from it but oh well. so now its about 3 am and im ready to puke and pass out so i can be fresh and ready for work at 5....fuck that&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes im a freakin idiot.......     &nbsp;   saterday....prety uneventful considering............just a long 12 hours of&nbsp; headache...feeling pretty bad for everyone who had to work with me...i was a raging bitch     &nbsp;   sunday....shitty day at work alot went wrong and alot of people got fired so i go home and head straight outside to soak up some sun and clean the pool...right in the middle of this gary calls and asks if i want to go eat with him...he sounds like he really wants to se me...very nice ive been missing him alot. i say ok and finish up and go hop in the shower but i guess i took to long because he pretty much told me to fuck right off...not like him to be so harsh and rude but maybe he had a bad day. now usally i would get upset about this but i kinda just blew it off and forgot about it. i guess he felt bad because 20 min later he sends me a sorry text. this impresses me alot...most guys even knowing they fucked up wouldnt admit it let alone apologize for it. garys now at jiffy lube on the phone with me and i have to drive right past there anyway so i figure ill stop and say hi.&nbsp; omg why does he have to be so hot!!!!!!!! he hasnt shaved and is wearing a whit t-shirt and khaki shorts....this has to me my all time fav guy outfit....yummy....whats real crazy is that im wearing almost the same thing...we look like one of thoses mushy couples that are so maddly in love that they dress alike....was good to see him even if it was for only a minute. back to the airport for me..have to pick drew up...he is a punk as always when he gets home...i missed him like crazy...could have done without seeing rob though. he is being such an ass lately

         now this is some cool shit..i can be much more descriptive if i use colored text....so tuesday gary and i had a good conversation that pretty much consisted of us both being undecided about what we should do about the whole us situation....i think we are both so scared of what might happen if we keep going that we never really just talk about that specificaly but on the other hand neither one of us can make a solid choice to stop seeing the other. im sick of thinking about it so i decided that we should just fuck...seems to be the best answer to anything that comes up with us...so i ask him if he wants to meet me at the porn store on his lunch the next day. nice and easy and incredibly hot... so i get up the next morning and spend the next few hours nervous as hell about meeting him. maybe because we always spend some kind of time to gether before we get naked and nasty or maybe because we have been talking more about forbidden subjects lately(mushylikeing stuff)thinking of doing something so skanky is also making me wet with anticipation. i love to do things that alotof people &nbsp;consider not right. so fianaly i get there and he is waiting...he looks soooooo fucking hot in work clothes...think GQ poster boy....yummmm !!!! im feeling like a highschool kid im all fidgety and a bit creeped out. being in a porn store sober and in the middle of the day may have had something to do with this. anyway we walk around for a sec but that just seems like a waste of our limited together time so off to a booth we go. even inside it was still kinda awkward untel his hands were on me and his mouth was on mine...much better...like instantly lost in a place where nothing existis except me and him. ive had amazing sex before but i havent quite felt such an explosive need for someones hands on me. now this is deffinatly something i could get used to....dont know if the boy's been reading books or what but god damn it was like he was reading my mind...he spent alot more time that ever before teasing me...very nice...by now im dripping wet and sooo ready to have him inside me but once his pants come down and i see how huge and hard he is all i can think is how good he would feel in my mouth...so with out thinking about what kind of nasty substance may be on the floor i drop to my knees....i swear i could feel him get super close to cumming...i think he is real good at holding back...i want to make him cum so bad that i really wouldnt even mind if he shot it all down my throat and didnt fuck me...he didnt come of course but more than made up for it when he picked me up and slid me down right on to him and got me off in less than 2 min...all this from a guy who couldnt get me off for nothing&nbsp;6 months ago.....wow....now all this was awesome but i really just wanted to be bent over and fucked hard..sounds bad i know but it makes me feel so naughty and it feels so good! i get my wish and he gets me off two more times before we are both soaked in sweat and ready to drop. im in satisfied la la land now...all warm and fuzzy...and very wet. now i promised myself before i got there that i would get him to cum even if he had to do it. i LOVE to watch him get himself off...makes me want to get fucked again but this 5 min is all about him...got to cut this short(people just walked in) just want to say that i got a huge load of cum in my mouth and spent the rest of the day walking around with the i just got fucked glow......       now this is my kinda lunch!!!!

When push comes to shove, you just forget about it--it's just not worth the heartache. What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.  You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around.   You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth.   MY RESULTS FROM 20 QUESTIONS TO A BETTER PERSONALITY....OUCH

      i just dont get um at all...why dont they make sense? ok so heres a little background for those of you who are interested ..me n gary are pretty cool together well way cool together and ive been trying for 6 months to not get attached or emotional but still continue to sleep with him. now i realize that thats unrealistic and life just isnt like that but hey he's smokin hot so im gonna try anyway. something about the guy is just addicting. when ive started getting feelings for him before i just kind of gracefully disapear for a few weeks or however long and then we seem cool again. not so this time. its just getting worse everytime i see him. sometimes he a fuck and sometimes he is so god damn mushy and cute around me i have no clue what goes through the guys head...well hey he decided to enlighten me yesterday. it was in guy language and it really seemed to be painful for him to just lay it all out...i think he is kinda in the same position as me when it comes to relationships ( been there done that dont want to again anytime soon) ok fuck this..im really trying to make sure i dont type things that might offend or bother him and that pisses me off so from now on im going to say exactly wtf i need/want to say. i think he likes me i think he really is getting feelings for me. i think he tried to tell me this but either he sucks at spilling his guts or i suck at comprehending things that scare me....dont know. after this odd conversation i kinda just sit around like a complete idiot for about 30 min trying to figure out what just happened and what was really said. i swear we have the most bizarre sport sex relationship. ok after all this he decides to not see me so naturally i freak a bit and think ill never see him again...ooohhhh to be an overdramatic female...so on to today...i miss him..... . .god im sappy sometimes. today was a bit better...well somewhat. i pretty much decided this was all to much for me and said im done. i thought this was something gary wanted also and that it would relieve some stress for us both. well he didnt really seem down for this idea...now this just totally caught me off gaurd and i didnt even know what to say...so right now were pretty much just hangin on to whatever it is that makes us crazy attracted to each other with out really saying that we are. for some reason thats comforting to me...i would be quite content with seeing him once or twice a week and keeping us not serious. that sounds much better than not seeing him at all

      yesterday sucked my mom and dad forgot to call me and i was all depressed so i went and wasted a bunch of money on non sense shit. i got about 10 new panties...some cute jammies and 2 pairs of pants...couple shirts...pink shoes that i just love...hmmm..what else..oh ya a bunch of makeup that i dont think ill use...ugh how stupid. to top of my shitty day i got all dressed up cute for gary and then didnt get to see him. wasnt anyones fault but it really sucked. so its a saterday night and my birthday and i was in bed by 10 drinking naked and alone. whats wrong with me? wade called at 10 my time and was just completely wasted. i think he just wanted to see if i was at home and not out. he talked forever about nothing. lmao at him when he gets his cell bill. i guess at least i got enough sleep to make it to work on time. had planned to go in a few hours late and work tel 6 instead of 2. shane says its a payback from the birthday gods for devoting 5 days a year for the last 4 years to being super wasted and stupid around out birthdays. maybe he is right....

      Last night was all kinds of hot...Much better than I expected. Got a little dressed up and hooked up with Gary around 9...I have to say that he was looking extra hot and being pressed against him was awesome as always. I wasn't quite sure how things would go considering we haven't really seen each other since my whole I like you bit but everything was just fine. I really tried to talk more so he wouldn't freak about me being to quiet but he still said something. I really don't feel like I talk any less than I normally do when im around him. Maybe he is just accustomed to overly talkative people. Anyway...We had a few beers really just extended foreplay for us...I almost thought he was just going to fuck me in the parking lot when I first saw him. I have never really been so instantly ready for sex with anyone before. I swear the guy just makes me drip just by occupying the same space as me for a minute. Now after about an hour we are both very ready to get naked but wanting this bad is hot so I try to drag it out by suggesting we go to a seedy strip club. Great idea...I just want him more when he is paying more attention to me watching naked chicks than to the girls themselves. Finaly we could wait no more and off to the porn store we went. A little different and awkward at first but once his hands were on me it didn't matter where we were I just had to have him inside me. I was super dripping wet...Wow I swear he got me off at least 4 times. Right away too. Of course I didn't make him come..That's almost a given now but I was really into dedicating the rest of the night and the next morning to trying. You would think I would have been satisfied after all that but it was just like a little taste of what I was craving. Wanted more more more!! As bad as this sounds I tried my best to get him to ditch his friend and come home with me but I wasn't successful obviously. He reminded me about the no sleeping rule and that helped a bit but right then I really didn't give a shit. I really didn't expect to see him again tonight but he seems to really want to. Ivy been trying to get ahold of skank a roo all day for a hot threesome but haven't heard back from her yet. She's the only chick I know that I can just randomly booty call for any kind of sex. Most girls take some convincing unless they are super trashed. Just thinking about watching Gary inside of her gets me all excited...Yummy

      hmmm...Have to make this short and quick because im not in a thinking typing kind of mood. Pretty much have just been working the last few days. Not a lot going on. Took the kids and had dinner with wade and kids last night. Got up fairly early for a day off and took him to the airport this morning. Had a nice long day of shopping with the kids all planned out but that went for a quick wrong turn when drew decided his cold medicine was nasty and projectile vomited all over forty thousand dollar leather seats....Nice  very nice. I cleaned and cleaned but I still smell it.... I guess im going to have to take the seat out and try again. Kids are leaving in a bit and I still have no idea what im going to do with myself tonight. im bored and have sex on the brain..im sure that's not good considering both of my sources for sport sex are not going to be around tonight. ohhhh yeah !!!!!!! Just got text from Gary...He's free tonight..Awesome!!!!!! Amazing how something so silly and simple cheers me right up. Sometimes I get some seriously guilty feelings for dividing my time between 2 guys. Even though we are very much nothing serious when im sleeping with Gary I don't have anything to do with other guys including wade. Well until sunriver. I did sleep with him there and I got all conflicted about it. im just not made to be a slut puppy I guess. Better just to stick to one guy at a time. Why is it I always end up feeling like a bad person when 90% of girls I know sleep with a lot more than 2 guys at once and they lie to all of them about it? I don't lie about it but I always come up with something to justify it just to make myself feel better. I wish I was a guy sometimes...I don't think they ever have issues like this. They just don't care as long as there scoring with some frequency. Ok done with this going to get all pretty up for what im sure will be an interesting night....

      mmm I feel much better. Took the kid's and spent the weekend in sunriver at wade's vacation house. ya ya crazy sounding but come on what stressed out chick would turn down a invite to be spoiled in a half a million $ vaca house for 4 days. lmao i so almost deleted that. Makes me sound materialistic and snobby. fuck that. Best bf I ever had was a dirty punk who worked part time as a cook and played guitar all day. Anyway back to the weekend...Got in late Thursday night and went straight for hottub then bed by 10. Driving for 3 hours sucks. Just wears me out. Friday we were up early and out playing in the woods by 8. Rented the kids bikes so we took several long rides...They were loving it. Spent most of Friday laying by the pool sucking down fruity drinks watching the kids play. Saturday we did a little fishing and a lot more laying by the pool. hmmmm very uneventful but was nice to have nothing to do for once. Went to see spider man but it was sold out :( poor drew...Got in a little tennis on Sunday didn't do half bad for once then took the kids into bend to do some shopping and get some junk food that they are accustomed to. Healthy home cooking wasn't going over to well. All in all it went better than I thought. Everyone was happy and relaxed. I shouldn't be sitting here..I have so much to do. Haven't payed bills for weeks have no clean clothes and on and on....Wanted to see Gary tonight but im not sure that's going to happen....might have to wait for tomorrow.

        mmm day off !! to bad its rainy and pretty blah outside. would have liked to be doing something besides this. its monster truck weekend...i want to go but i dont seem to know anyone that is free that wants to go. i have been playing with the idea of asking gary...im sure he would be into that...but im pretty sure he would say no and im still being a sensitive girl so thats not something i want to hear. i wanted to go see him the other night so i asked him what he thought and he said" do what you want" now to me that says fuck no i dont want to see you. if i say that to someone it means i dont like you very much but i dont want to listen to you bitch about me saying no...he says thats not what he ment at all and that i always read into things to much. dont really know. i wish he would have just said yes or something simple. as weird as it was last time i just might go out with annmarie tonight. she has been asking all week and i was hesitant to give her an answer just in case something better came up...i know thats mean..but nothing has so far so i might as well hang out with her...maybe she wont girly freak on me this time....wishful thinking! or maybe girl sex is what i need and will satisfy me for a bit...

        I do need to say that Gary was really sweet and way to nice about all this.  He didn't freak out or yell and was very cool with me. He went out of his way to make me feel better even   though I didn't deserve it from him at all. Being dumped when you didn't even know you were   together enough to be dumped is shitty but this guy sure does it graciously. How could I not love someone this sensitive....

        Ok so I know at least one person has been waiting for this to happen...Saturday heather calls and wants to babysit...Of course I say ok. Drop kids off around 7 and wade asks if I want to go have dinner...I have no plans so I say yes. Now even with all my intense feelings for Gary we have never really even talked about being serious..So I assume that's not what he wants and that he sees other people. Come on I have read in his blog about other girls and he has encouraged me to see other guys as well. This is stupid now but really all I wanted was for him to tell me he thinks it could work or fuck, anything to let me know that he only is with me. I would be estatic. I see wade to keep myself unattached. I didn't want to get hurt. I promised after all I went through with wade that love was not for me and that I would never let it happen again. I was sooo sure it wouldn't. It really snuck up on me and hit me hard. Anyway...So wade and I go to dinner then to mix...Gary is there and I tell wade I don't want to go in. Even if we are not serious I wouldn't want to see Gary with another girl. Of course wade doesn't care so we stay. I felt like throwing up...I hated to be in the same space as him and not be touching him. Crazy things were flying through my head...If I hadn't been so scared of rejection I would have just thrown myself at him. I was to scared that he would tell me to fuck off. There were a lot of questioning eyes and bar tension was very obvious. Was a very very uncomfortable situation for more than just me. Just looking at him makes my heart beat a bit faster...I cant even begin to explain how he makes me feel...After about 40 horrible minutes we leave and go to strip clubs then to feelgoods....Gary is now there...My feelings by now have escalated a bit more due to the shots I threw back trying to calm down. Sometimes this boy makes me feel incredibly psycho.....Girls are dancing with him and im 3 feet away...Jealous..Crazy shit going through my head..I need him and have to be with him always..I try to imagine what would happen if I just told wade to fuck off...I did this to myself...I figure that I have been the perfect girlfriend before...I don't cheat..im respectful...I put my whole self into my relationships and do everything I can to make that other person happy and secure. I always get fucked...Always. So I decide to change my ways and be a snake and OMG its a lot worse than being cheated on or dumped. My rotten choices lost me at least the chance to know what could have happened with Gary and I. How many times does a person fall in love? What if I don't ever again? So far its not going so good for me...Feels like pieces of my insides are missing. Not very pleasant. Once I get alone and try to sleep it really hits me...The one Sunday I wake up without a hangover I wake up with a crying headache...Much worse. I hate crying and I don't do it very much...I have a feeling that im in for a long crying streak now. My first thought when I wake up is Gary...I need to see him. I get dressed and try to drive to his house but I cant do it. I think it was a mix of ashamed of my actions,scared of the reprocussions,and hurt. Not that I had any right to be. I called instead. He is done...I tried sooo very hard to not cry. Didn't work. After a long day of tears I start to get mad...Like my head is trying to transfer the blame. im pissed at him for not saying something...For not letting us be something other that fuck buddies. im really pissed that I've gotten to a freaking out point over someone who I was never serious with. I feel stupid and I despise feeling like this. At least 10 times a day I want to just drop everything im doing and run to him. He makes me feel safe..Not sure why but that's important to me. Seems to draw me to him even more. Why didn't I just give in and give him the time he asked for? God I could do this all night but its making me upset. I need to stop now. im done with guys for awhile...This fucking sucks

      Intellectualizing a problem is useful, but only if you engage your emotions as well. Make sure you don't rule out any of the possibilities just because they seem too far-fetched. Nothing is impossible right now. Someone close to you deviates sharply from the norm, but don't be too quick to judge their point of view. This could be a great opportunity for you to learn a lesson. -
