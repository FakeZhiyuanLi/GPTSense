      Well, sorry I haven't posted in a while. Grounded, as usual. Today was the same as every other day. I finally got my schedule done. First semester I've got Cobined studies, latin 1 and band, and second I have geometry, chemistry, latin 2 and band. Life just keeps getting more and more boring.....not much to type about. To keep you guys occupied, here is a poem written by Matthew Ayers, it makes no sense to me, but he sent it to me forever ago to print out for him so he could have it at school the next day.   After committing the sexcrime, all I can do is think of you. You are doubleplus beautiful. I am fullwise in love with you. I bellyfeel the thought crimes I commit will surely get me killed. I thought strongly of throwing this poem in the memory  hole to escape the ungood consequences. If I get vaporized and become an unperson please donâ€™t  forget me.    Love, Me  Now wasn't that inspiring? Time for the quote of the day.  Quote of the Day: While talking about fast food rules and regulations, Daniel Ponder said,(I think he was trying to be funny but I'm not sure), "Don't put the fat in the oil!"                                                         Man, this guy is coo.....

      Sorry, no post today, just a quote.  Quote of the Day: When we asked Alex if he was in the senior olympics to be famous he responded in a strange accent, "Hey, I'm just tryin' to be a normal guy livin' a normal life in a normal world, wishin' on a normal star."

      Today was really different. I had to come to school dressed in a white shirt, black pants, and tie. I felt really stupid. Performing for evening of the arts was exciting. I got to solo twice, and it was improv. Other than the performances, the day was uneventful and boring. Actually, it wasn't.....I'm just tired and don't feel like typing much.  Quote of the Day:In band, when I was talking with Adam about going to Dollywood and getting wet together, Ashley said she would go in a white shirt with no bra and I said I would go without a bra too.

      Today was ok I guess. The morning seemed to go by fast. After getting to school, I droped my instument off and headed to Wellness with.......(drum roll)..........COACH EDWIN STAIR!!! Once there, I walked and played vollyball for a considerable amount of time. When we went upstairs, he started jabbering nonsense. I decided to time how long it took between his saying "uh". The longest wast 57 seconds, and shortest, 1/2 of a second. In math, Mrs. Connor told me I wasn't going to be in evening of the arts, because I wasn't on the program. After a heated debate, I convinced her I was going to play. As usual, nothing of importance happened in biology. Band was boring. After band, I practiced for tommarow and went to a dress rehersal. Apparently I'm gonna solo. Kinda scary...I guess. Then, Chris drove me home. Thats about it.  Quote of the Day: Daniel Ponder, when asked to fold a piece of paper, responded "I'm not an on hands kind of guy."  Today's moral is as follows:

      Man today sucked. I got grounded cause I hit my brother. Hard. So I really shouldn't be typing this now....oh well. My dad was screaming at me as we went to school. When I went into the building, I went and dropped my instrument off, said "yo, sup" to Adam, Ponder, and Josh, and then i went to English. That class is such a waste of time. I dont think i've learned anything in there, and what I read on my own is a much higher level. Anyhow, after that I went to visit my favorite person in the whole world for Algebra 2....Mrs. Connor. Supprisingly, she didn't seem like she was on her period today, and wasn't extremly bitchy. Chase and I pulled our own hair out and put it in this girls hood. Loads-o-Laughs that was. Until Chase told me to pull one of her hairs out....she didn't take that very well. Our homework was easy; it was over angles. In third period, biology, Mrs. Wey was nice as usual, and it was really easy. I had to take a sax lesson from Smokin' Bob, so i didn't get to eat. Band was fun, I talked  with Tiffany some, and thats about it. After band, i had to go to an AFS meeting, then I just sorta sat there with Ponder for an hour or so. When i came home, i did my math, slept, and am now writing an essay.  Quote of the day: DJ King, when asked his opinion on love at first site by Mrs. Hayes responded, "My door sorta swings both ways on that one."  I'll try to keep updated, but as previously mentioned, I am grounded, so it will be hard.

      Well, ill start my first real post with what i did this weekend. On Friday I came home and sat around, then i slept. On Saturday, my dad woke me up, and wanted me to go ref my brothers AYSO soccer game. I told him to get the hell out of my room. Then i slept some more. When i awoke, i went out and ran the dog around the block. I felt really gay doing it. Then, when i got back, my brother informed me that Daniel Unger had called me about practicing for evening of the arts. So i called him back. He told me that my brother, Dylan, was probably the weirdest person he had ever talked to on the phone. Then, Chris came and picked me up to take me to Michaels house, and with him, Chris, Daniel, and Anne i practiced the music for Evening of the Arts. After doing that for a while, we went out and threw a frisbee around, nearly taking Anne's head off numerous times. Fun-fun it was. Then i came home and talked to people for hours on the internet, and went to bed. Today my dad went to Atlanta, and my brother is out with his skater-punk friends yo, so I've been alone all day. I guess i've been on the internet all day, taking the occasional break to piss, eat, and take the dog out. I should probably do homework now........essay on fate.......damn you fate......

      Well, this is in response to what daniel said about my blog. I know these things are stupid, but I had a lot on my mind, and unlike you, I do have emotions......I suppose I sound gay on here, but oh well. I'm not gonna deny I have feelings for things, and I'm not gonna devote this whole thing to making fun of people, thats getting less and less amusing to me, as strange as that may sound. Oh well, I'm sure this post will get made fun of too. After all, isn't that what makes life so great for you Daniel? Anyhow, don't fear, I don't plan on having to many posts like that.

      ME AND ASHLEY ARE TOGETHER AGAIN!! I'm happier about this than anyone could ever know. Last night there were some problems, but today Ashley sorted things out for me, and now I understand. If your reading this Ashley, I love ya, lol.  Anyhow, here is somethin different. Last night, when I was feeling horrible, Adam Russell sent me this wonderful little analogy, I think all guys can relate to this.  "you just gotta take it man......its really hard to get over a girl that you really care about and have been trying to get for a long time......i know its worse than getting kicked in the balls over and over, but just like that, eventually the pain will go away.....it will take a long time....im not gonna lie to you and say it wont.....but then one day it will all be okay"  Apparently he thought I wanted to get over Ashley. Oh well, he was wrong. But the saying is still hilarious.

      Now I'm feeling down and need some inspiration. Look at this uplifting short essay on friends, by Aleisa Moussa, It's worth a few laughs.  Friends: Why They Are Important      Suddenly, he was stabbed.  Caesar looked down at the razor sharp dagger in his chest.  He placed his hands over the bleeding wound.  In an instant, he collapsed.  Surely he would die here.  Before he crossed over, Julius took one final look at the now-spinning room.  It was filled with snickering faces.  Then he recognized someone, his longtime friend Brutus.  He had been betrayed.  With his last breath he uttered, "And you too, Brutus."      Caesar's head fell against the cold, marble floor.  Julius, the great emperor, had been killed by his best friend.  Brutus' role in history shows the impact of friends throughout the ages.      Have you ever heard the saying blood is thicker than water?  Some people believe that family should come before true friends.  However, friends can be just as important.  A friend could be like the family you never had.  When you can't rely on your family, you can definitely count on your friends. They share a type of connection, unmatched by anything else.  Families can break apart or divorce, but a good friendship is stronger.  Many people would do anything for a friend in need.      Studies show that the qualities you look for in a friend may actually be traits you are lacking.  If you want a dependable friend, maybe you feel you need to be more dependable yourself.  Perhaps you've been lied to or mislead in the past.  This too might explain why you choose to be friends with certain people.      A friend can be anyone.  Many people choose animals for companions.  Most animals, such as dogs, are loyal to the end.  Pets and their owners have a special kind of friendship.  The owners are kind and provide the animal with what they need, and in return the animal supplies the human need of acceptance and love. Most owners treat their pets just like a human acquaintance.  In many ways, they can be some of the greatest friends.  Everyone remembers their first pet.  Though they may not see it, a lot of people act like or share traits with their pets.      People need friends.  All humans must have interaction.  Sever psychological problems can result from not enough exposure to people who like them for themselves.  Just look at the Columbine incident.  Those people who killed felt left out and unliked.  If even one person was one of those boy's friends, maybe none of that would have happened.  By even being kind to someone, you are a friend.  This can make a significant difference in someone's life.  Instead of being rude or mean, try to get along with other people.  You never really know when you might need them.  Maybe, just maybe, if you get along, you two could become good friends.   Aleisa Moussa    Now I feel better........

      Boring day. Sad stuff happened. Happy stuff happened. Started growing bacteria cultures in biology. Kurt swabed his gooch. When Matthew Ayers did it as a freshman, he swabed his bum hole. I guess I should go do homework now.....people should call me, I get lonely. I'd post my number, but you can find it on desks at the school with the words above it, "For a good time call:", so you all can just get it there. Saturday Daniel is supposed to fight this GP guy. Like an idiot I'm gonna back the racist up. Oh well. So I guess I'm goin to the movies friday and saturday........  Look! A really big bass saxophone!!     Now that's what I wanna play next year.  By the way, we will all miss you next year Cassy.

      Man, spring break has sucked. I have been so bored. My vacation has consited of eating, sleeping, pissing, and talking to people online. Maybe things will pick up. Last night i went to a party at garretts. It was oodles of fun. We took a picture of this huge lady in food city with daniels camera phone. Maybe you'll see it on his blog one day. Otherwise, not much goin on. Ill try to start posting more. (So many blogs are popin up now.....its just not the "hip" thing to do anymore.)  Oh, by the way, if you're reading this Ashley, "I love ya back".

      Not much happened today. Saw Bean and Baily in school. Sorta funny, but they were obsessed with the word constipation.  Here is something interesting I found. I was reading video game reviews when I found this review of halo 2. Check out the spelling and grammar.  PEOPLE CALM DOWN......... This game will blow, why? Because its like future and stupid stuff like ugly guns and all that. I dont care what u think about my review. But this is my opinion.... I thick this game wont be a big dial. I thick rainbow six 3 its a big dial. Its real like in real live. And halo its just mosthers and laser so fake.........dont like it...........i mean why would u buy a game that its borring like that. Just because its a new game it doesn't mean evert one will go crazy about it from 1 to 5 ill give it a 11111 it blow.........sucks. Make games that are in the present, not the future.....not proded....

      Sorry I haven't posted in a long time. I've had plenty of other things on my mind and haven't had time. Last week has been pretty good; maybe things are starting to look up, I guess I'll soon see.  Here's something great to keep you guys occupied. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Don't worry, no nudity. You'll need quick time, and if you don't have it just download it when it asks, its fairly small.  urlLink WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!

      Today was the Dollywood Parade. Whoo hoo!!! Dolly was right behind us. Joy above all joys. My brother carried the banner, and according to him, Alysa wants to have mad sex with me.....but I already knew that. Damnit, I know thats not how you spell her name, oh well.  Quote of the Day: When I walked by Mr. Black Guy in wellness, he yelled TALIBAN!!!! at me over and over.  If anyone caught what I edited out of this post....well....guess what that means....I lied.

      Today sucked, as usual. I'm not gonna do what I usually do and tell about every class because that is far to boring. After school, I had marching practice. There is this one 8th grade saxophone girl who's marching skills rival penis-heads playing skills. God she was stupid. I had to do a whole lot of yelling. Afterwards, one of the more depressing things thats happened to me in a long while came to be, but I'm not going to get into that......(I get the strangest feeling other people are reading this other than me)......Doc asked my brother, Dylan, if he would carry the banner in tomorrows parade. Stupidest thing docs done in a long long time. I don't really have much homework, so I think I'm just going to sit here and reflect on today's depressing event.....or jack off, whichever I get the urge for.  No quote today, but if you ever hear anything incredibly stupid, send it to me at HamHamInTheHouse@aol.com

      Well, here is something amusing. We have all come to know at love that famous philosopher Archie Frink. In fact, many of us have wanted to sex him up. Anna sent me this little quote of his and I found it so incredibly stupid I had to put it on my blog.   DingoLiberation [7:57 PM]:  so, let me get this straight...you went from an immature kid in your freshmen year, to a wise 16 year old junior, then back to an immature superficial guy that asked for make out sessions that were recorded, then back to what? a wise 16 year old junior whos going to be a senior next year?  ClintonwasSKA [7:58 PM]:  I try not to apply stereotypes, because they are judgments ClintonwasSKA [8:01 PM]:  I just don't try to sum up my thoughts and actions into words ClintonwasSKA [8:01 PM]:  it's unnecessary for me :)   Ok Archie, we can all see you are trying to play the tortured soul. And let me tell you something, I've been there, done that, and you are overdoing it. Not a fun road to go down either. Man, why the hell has everyone I know liked him at some point? It must be his sexy hair......

      I was talking to Jena earlier and I let my dog off his chain to bring him inside. He ran away. I had to chase him around the whole neighborhood. Eventually, he took this little kid's shoe and ran away with it. I tried to catch him, but alas, it was to late for yon shoe. Funny thing is I think it was this little Indian kid's shoe. They live across the street from me and are terrified of my dog. I'm still working on that audio post, I'll do it later. I guess that's it for now. I must have way to much time on my hands to put in this many posts in on one day. Oh well.

      Wow, Ashley, you really need to learn some manners on the phone. Hanging up on me like that, and calling me a gay mexican, and making me talk to your brother.....tisk tisk tisk...Well, later I hope to try my first audio post. I'm reluctant to do it on my own though, so I think I'll do it 3-way with someone. Anyways, that's it for now.

      Well, today has been ok I guess. As unstable as I am, there are now once again three people that I "have my eye on". Two I have liked before, one is new. Anyways, put on comments who you think it is. Stuff has been so slow lately, I'm so bored. I need people to do stuff with over the summer....I'm gonna be so lonely. So I'm hiring a friend. I'll pay 10 dollars an hour if your a guy, 15 if your a girl. Call me if you want an interview for this job at 453-8868. Anyways....so very bored.  urlLink Go here and take this quiz . It's probably way to easy, but this way I can get mad at people who don't make a 100. Anyhow....so very bored..... I can't wait 'till next year. It's gonna be really interesting with all the new people in band. Apparently Torry's sister (ok, I know that's not how you spell his name) is really hot. Ashley told me that one. Well, since no one would ever like me, I'll somehow hook her up with Daniel Ponder. He hates it when I do stuff like that. In ways I am dreading the summer, in others I can't wait. I will be working, and that's a plus. Also, there are certain things I need to get over that I'm not 100% done with yet (you all know what I'm talking about) and I'm hoping that going through the summer without seeing certain people will make those feelings fade. However, it's going to be a depressing time. No one is going to call me, nor do anything with me. But oh well, not much I can do about that. If your reading this Jena, I'm here for you. Next Thursday is gonna be weird....Ashley is coming to my house, now there's a scary thought. Anyways, that's all for now. I think I will post again later tonight. Gotta call Bob to get that saxophone.....maybe I'll have him meet me tommarrow in band.

      Well, I'm not in a very good mood. There is someone I feel like I'm starting to care about very much (yes, I now like someone else, I guess I'm "unstable" right now.) who is going through a very hard time and I feel like no matter how much I try to help it just won't be enough. It's just not fair, the most horible things happen to the best people. And now someone is just making it harder for her. Worse yet, the other person is another one of my friends. But that doesn't matter. Anyways, I'm gonna do everything I can to help this person, even if it costs me the other ones friendship. I owe this person so much (they were one of two people who really kept me going when I just felt like dying, and she still helps me by just making me feel good every time I talk to her) and I wanna do everything I can to help. If that person is reading this, you know who you are, and I promise things will get better.  Anyways, what else did I do today......I haven't posted in a while cause I've been grounded. Today I went saxophone shopping, and thats about it. Well, the year is about over. Yesterday was graduation, it was sorta sad. I nearly cried when I told Adam goodbye. Anyways, I guess this is it for now. Man, I am gonna be so lonely over the summer.....

      Man my weekend sucked. I got grounded, and band banquet was really depressing. Chris Click pretty much summed it up for me when he said "Andrew can get two dates and you can't even get one, how does that make you feel?" Anyways, thats not all that was bad about it. I don't feel like getting into it now. However, there is one thing that is getting good I'm not gonna get into just yet. By the way Anna, what is going on with Adrian? Uhh....thats really weird....I dont even know her.  Time for Dustin's poetry corner. Today's topic-"how much you love me AND your native american roots." As always, that topic was chosen by Aleisa.  Ahh...I'll do this tommarrow. For now feast your eyes on this

      I'm in such a good mood today. Those three people are now just one person. Very exciting stuff. I think she might even share the feeling. I've got this awards day thing later....I wonder what I'll get. I really don't wanna go, I'd rather got to this band concert to see this person, but I think I have to. Not much else going on. I heard my brother say "fuck" today. Upon hearing this, I ran and found him, threw him on the ground, lightly kicked his bottom, and told him if I ever hear him say it again I will kill him. It's that damned blink 182. I swear he is turning into a skater. Soon he will have nose rings and tattoos. Well, now I'll go back to waiting for that special person to get online.  By the way, start posting coments on my posts. Makes things more fun.

      It's time for Dustin's poetry corner. This is all devoted to Aleisa, she will give me a topic, and I will wright about it. I appoligize in advance if this makes anyone angry. Today's topic is Andrews dick versus mine. (pretend there is a bongo player in the background....Daniel Ponder)  "Triple A meets car battery; You see the triple A, you cant help but gasp; The car battery chills you to the bones; Is there hair to be found on the triple A?; None that I can gaze upon; Is there hair to be found on the car battery?; Why don't you look and see; But despite the size; Everyone loves Andy's sausage; Regardless of the notion that it's unpurbertized; Oh, one can't help but take a mighty laugh when thee sees its size!; My weiner dwarfs Andrew's; I bet he isn't even circumsized; Don't even ask me, I'm a jew; I don't think I had a briss; Though it's something I'm sad I missed; Glory be unto Josh, the puller of the pants!; You showed the world Andrew's dick; And my! what a small stick; The triple A and the car battery; Which will you rely on when you need power?; Think about it, I'll give you....ahhh....an hour....."    Well that was gay. Oh well, when Aleisa commands I must obay. Instead of sending me hate mail just ask me politely to take it off and I will. Next week I will continue Dustin's poetry corner, so until then, farewell.

      Today was slow......things are so confusing right now. Daniel had inschool.....he deserves it, but for a cell phone? That rule is really stupid....and I think Mrs. Connor shoulda told him before he got the slip....oh well. I sat with John Weiss at lunch today. Those few moments were the most excited (and aroused) I've ever been. He has big arms. Very masculine. He sexed up Treffner's sister....ha.....serves Dustin right for stealing my name. From now on I guess I'll just go by my middle name....so from now on, I'm Mitch. I should change the name of this blog to Mitch's Nich.....nah, then everyone would call me Mitch. Well, I think I'm gonna go. I love you all.....in an unhealthy stalker rapist way. Just dont forget that. Ever.   I'm feeling so weird right now........

This little extention is for you, Daniel's xbox live friends, I love you guys........

      This was just so great I had to take it off the comments and put it here...   Cassy said...  This has nothing to do with your post... but YOU of all people should know how I feel about Josh. YOU know I would never do anything to hurt him like go out with Daniel, or anyone, behind his back.. Someone said YOU told him that me and Daniel were going out. That is the most ridiculous thing that has ever come out of anyone's mouth. YOU should know how much I love Josh, I would never do that to him. And if you knew me at all, YOU would know I would never do that to anyone, especially Josh. I don't know what motivates you to constantly ruin people's relationships, and I don't want to know. I just know that I don't want to talk to you for LONG time. And yes everyone does think you're weird, not because of what I had on my blog but bc you hurt people intentionally. I don't know what's happened to you. You've changed.   First off, I didn't say anything that has anything to do with Daniel and Cassy. I talked to Daniel before any of this happened, and he knows I don't care one way or the other and am remaining neutral. Also, since when do I try to ruin other peoples relationships. For the past month, Cassy has blaimed multiple people for trying to break her and Josh up, and every time he does so much as talks to a girl, she freaks out. I'm so mad that I'm getting blamed for something I'm not even involved in, and have so much more to say about this, but for now I have to go. I'll post more later.

       urlLink I always complain about being bored, but when I do, and I really start to think about it, I go to this site and it makes things seem so much better.  I'm just posting this, because once again, I'm bored. Also, no  urlLink philosophical questions  or  urlLink inspirational thoughts  come to mind. So out of boredom and lack of material I leave you with the lyrics to a song I like.  Fruitcakes  By: Jimmy Buffett, Amy Lee  1994  --Spoken:  "You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day she  runs this space station and bake shop down near Boomtown. She told  me that human beings are flawed individuals. The cosmic bakers  took us out of the oven a little too early. And that's the  reason we're as crazy as we are and I believe it."   "Take for example when you go to the movies these days, you know.  They try to sell you this jumbo drink, 8 extra ounces of watered  down cherry coke for an extra 25 cents. I don't want it.  I don't want that much organziation in my life.  I don't want other people thinking for me.  I want my Junior Mints. Where did the Junior Mints go in the  movies. I don't want a 12 lb. Nestle's crunch for 25 dollars. I  want Junior Mints."   "We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers!  We need people that care! I'm mad as hell! And I don't want to  take it anymore!"   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   Paradise, lost and found  Paradise, take a look around  I was out in California where I hear they have it all  They got riots, fires, mud slides  They've got sushi in the mall  Water bars, brontasaurs, chinese modern lust  Shake and bake life with the quake  The secret's in the crust   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "Speakin' of fruitcakes, how 'bout the government?  Your tax dollars at work."   We lost our Martian rocket ship  The high paid spokesman said  Looks like that silly rocket ship  Has lost its cone shaped head  We spent 90 jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars  I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the galaxy (Fruitcakes in the galaxy)  Fuitcakes on the earth (Fruitcakes on the earth)  Struttin' naked towards eternity  We've been that way since birth  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "Religion! Religion! Oh, there's a thin line between Saturday  night and Sunday morning. Here we go now.  Alright, alter boys."   Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa   Where's the church, who took the steeple  Religion is in the hands of some crazy-ass people  Television preachers with bad hair and dimples  The god's honest truth is it's not that simple  It's the Buddhist in you, it's the Pagan in me  It's the Muslim in him, she's Catholic ain't she?  It's the born again look its the WASP and the Jew  Tell me what's goin on, I ain't gotta clue   --Spoken:  "Now here comes the big ones. Relationships! We all got 'em, we  all want 'em. What do we do with 'em?  Here we go, I'll tell ya."   She said you gotta do your fair share  Now cough up half the rent  I treat my body like a temple  You treat yours like a tent  But the right word at the right time  May get me a little hug  That's the difference between lightning  And a harmless lightnin' bug   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "The future. Captain's log, stardate two thousand and something."   We're seven years from the millenium  That's a science fiction fact  Stanley Kubrick and his buddy HAL  Now don't look that abstract  So I'll put on my Bob Marley tape  And practice what I preach  Get Jah lost in the reggae mon  As I walk along the beach  Stay in touch with my insanity really is the only way  Its a jungle out there kiddies  Have a very fruitful day  Hey.   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "That's right, you too. Yeah those crumbs are spread all around  this universe. I've seen fruitcakes. I saw this guy in Santa  Monica rollerskate naked through the crosswalk. Down in New  Orleans in the French market there are fruitcakes like you cannot  believe. New York, forget it. Fruitcake city. Down island, we've got  fruitcakes. Spread them crumbs around. That's right, we want  'em around. Keep bakin' baby. Keep bakin'."

      Well, though a day late, I'm going to call this my Father's Day post. I woke up at 6:30 to make my dad breakfast, then I went to work. Towards the end of the day, three big guys with beards came in. The first sat down, and I began talking to him. We spoke about AFS, because he was curious where the Russian girl that works with me was from. Then he told me the two people with him were foreign, one from Germany, one from Denmark. He also went on to tell me I'd be after his daughter, because she is 15 and foreign. He seemed to approve of that thought, and spoke with me more about his daughter. Then the two foreign men came and sat down. They asked where their coffee was, and I said I would go check for them. The German one started yelling, "No time! Meeting is now!!", while the other two told me to ignore him and go check on the coffee. So, I went and got their coffee and brought it to them. I then came back a moment later, and the German stuck his finger in the coffee, and splashed it on me and said, "dieser Kaffee ist, geben mir mein Geld zurÃ¼ck, Sie schmutziger Jude kalt!" Which translates to: "this coffee is cold , give me my money back,you dirty Jew!" Anyways, I'd rather not go any further with that story, but I will say the manager got involved. And no....I don't think he said anything about Jews....But I found putting that appropriate. But he did speak in German....And he did yell...And shake his fist..And splash the coffee on me. From there I went up to the mountains with my dad, and we shared a beer...Or two.That's it for that day. For now, "Ich bin aus". Or, for you English folks, "I'm out".  By the way, I'd like to thank Aleisa for the translation. Good luck with AFS.

      Ok, look what I found on Cassy's blog.   hamhaminthehouse: Why cant we all just look to the heart and find what is special about that one person and bring it out in their charecter   Ok, I'm weird, but I'd never say anything like that. Besides, I know how to spell the word "character". Thanks for being a great friend, never lying to me, and  never  making a mockery of me. Like I said in a former post, class of '06, I hate most of you guys. I really need to pick and choose the few friends I have more wisely, don't I? Well, time to go take a bubble bath with candles, meditate, and listen to New Age music to get this off my mind. People suck.

      Well, I'm starting to settle back in to the every day, no changes routine. This is what I dreaded summer would be, and so it is becoming. I really wish there were some people out there to do stuff with, but hey, make the most of what you've got. The reason I haven't been posting lately is that I have been grounded do to unforseen circumstances. If this has caused any inconvienience, make me aware, and I will contact our manager promptly. As for the comments on the last post....I know one of the anonymous ones was Aleisa, as she hates my personality, though I'm not sure if she hates me. As for the others, well......I'm guessing one is Justin, and the other is Ponder...Though I thought he was more timid with such matters. Let me know if I was right, because if not I think I have someone visiting my blog that I really need to restrict. If you don't let me know who you are, I'm going to have to turn off anonymous comments, and if that doesn't work, comments altogether. Sorry, but once again, I think one of those people may be someone I really don't want on my site. With that note, I'm out.

      Well I'm home again, and not the same person as the one who left on that trip. First off, I'm never gonna be depressed again. Also, I refuse to be a  braggadocio any longer. Things are starting to really look my way. After tomorrow maybe I will be able to say that for sure. A few of you might know why. Work sucked, due to an unexpected bus-load of old people. And with that incredibly short post, I believe I shall depart. I'm out.

      Well, I now post from my humble home as I have returned from Hotlanta. I'll go ahead and begin by summing everything up that happened after that last audio post. The dance is the first matter worthy of discussion. Daniel went around asking every girl he saw to dance with Andrew. And almost all of them said no but they would dance with me. I ended up turning 5 people down. That was really weird. Then this one girl met me.....It is a really long story I don't feel like getting into, so I'm just going to leave her out of this post, but bear in mind we were walking around with her in six-flags as well. From the dance, bed. Andrew picked up some girls at the dance. That Temple is a real pimp, he had 5 girls following him and T-Love around. They gave him their phone number and everything. While we were in Atlanta we came to love DMX. I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go.......Inside joke, but anyways, we tried to get Will to add that to his farewell speech..He chickened out. I guess it was the five-thousand people he had to present the speech to that did it. The mall was fun (I got a book and a CD), and half our club got stuck on the subway. That was hilarious, there was one girl pressed up against the window nearly in tears as the train drove away and they were stuck....Sad, but like I said, funny. Six-flags was probably the best part of the trip. Daniel Ayers got his pants pulled completely down in front of about 50 complete strangers, but that's a story to be told in person. Justin, Ponder, and I went around riding everything. On Superman, we kept trying to spit on each other every time the ride turned. Daniel met a lot of black people, and believe it or not, found one he liked. It really makes you think that there is still hope left for this world, does it not? So, after much walking around and making complete idiots of ourselves, all that came to an end, and we returned to the hotel to partake in our favorite hobby, elevator joy riding. We would go to the top, and then come down, and no matter how many people were on there, we would throw our arms up and yell "Whoooo!!!" the whole way down. Today we packed and left for home. On the way I discovered a rising freshman and a rising 8th grader like me. I don't think I'll comment further on that matter. So the trip came to an end, and we all said goodbye to all those crazy people from other states we met. It was a good trip, but I'm not sure it compared to the Orlando trip. So this post comes to an end. I'm out.

      Well, today was slow. Only exciting thing that happened was that these British girls I met at work came back. Their dad asks me every time they come in if I'm married yet. Real nice people. Anyhow, this really big girl's dad wrote her phone number on a menu for me today. Man it was awkward. Other than that, not much is going on. I'm supposed to go to Splash Country tomorrow but I can't get through to anyone to find out when and where we meet. I am going to be really pissed if this doesn't work out. Someone better call me with the info   tonight  . You can tell by how I put that in bold  and  italics that I'm damn serious. That's it for now. I'm out.

      Well, it's my day off work and no one will or can do anything with me...except Cassy, but if just me and her went off and did something that would definitely give off the wrong idea. So at home alone I sit around all day. I am so bored. If anyone reads this before the end of the day that wants to do something, call me. I had to get up at 6 this morning for a saxophone lesson, and it was really embarrassing. I really need to practice more often. At least I think I know which new saxophone I'm getting. Well,  urlLink this is it . I just put those pics there cause I'm really bored, hence the title of this post. Well, I'll add to this later.

      Well, Jared's party was last night. It was fun, though I did at one point get hit in the face by a cell phone. The damn thing just came flyin' outta no where. After a while, I went to sleep, because I had to get up early to go to work. I woke up at about three or four covered in purple sun tan lotion. It was really cold and sticky, and it ruined my clothes. However, they got it everywhere, and it stained the carpet, so everyone had to stay up forever cleaning except me. Today, at work, I met a very very interesting person....Sorta skanky. It's gonna be real interesting working with her. She made fun of me for being a virgin....I found that pretty funny. From work I came here, and thats about it. Talking to some people and thinking about my situation with these two girls....things just seem to go up and down. I don't know where it's going, and I'm just gonna be really careful. I really don't wanna get hurt again.....Well, I guess that's it. I'll just let time go by and see what happens.

      Things are getting really confusing...The whole thing with Ashley is starting up again. I'm just afraid to act in any way, cause she is about to leave for the next six weeks or more. But who knows, maybe we can work something out. Also this thing with that girl I was talking about earlier (her name is Brittany) is getting more and more confusing. I don't know her well, and I would really like to get to know her better and then see how that goes and go from there, but I don't know if her friends are gonna let that happen. I just wish I knew what was so horrible about me or what I did...Anyhow, I'm the old me again. We will see how this all works out....and I really hope it works out where I can make everybody happy, but it seems like if it makes me happy, no one else is. I guess that's it for now. I'll keep you guys posted. People just need to mind their own business.....Check back tonight for an audio post, it may be late, but I wanna try to make one from Jared's birthday party. I'm out.

      Man I am in such a good mood. Today, I met someone that honestly just took my breath away. She was really nice, and I just felt I could really relate to her personality and sense of humor, not to mention that she was drop dead gorgeous. Anyways, Ponder and I went to the movies, and 'twas great fun. Although he sorta looked alone....oh well...Anyway, I hope to get to know this special person a little better. It's really a relief to meet someone like that. I guess thats it for now...I think I might have a good summer to look forward to after all. And Sarah, if you read this, I'm really sorry I made you upset. That's all for now, but I will post something else later. I still need someone to do another audio post with.

      Well, I'm an asshole. Plain and simple. I over-react to everything, and as of late I have been to dramatic. It's just cause of everything I have been through this year. First off, Ashley, no matter what happens between us, you are always if not my best, one of my dearest friends, (I don't like to say I have a best friend, but if I did, maybe it would be you). That appology you gave me was the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Anyhow, maybe she can forgive me. That's it for now. I'm gonna miss some people so much....I will be the old me soon, I promise.

      Here is something else that just fuled my anger. She calls me and asks whats wrong. I tell her. She gets angry. She sorta blames me. Then she angrily says, "Well, sorry I ruined our friendship!", and hangs up on me.....man life sucks. The worst things come from the best intentions don't they? I think she hates me...oh well that's not a new thought.

      Ok, I'm in a really bad mood. But it's a good thing. 'Cause it's not a self-loathing depressed bad mood, it's a mad as hell bad mood. First off, I've decided I hate the entire class of '06 with the exception of like 5 people. One of those rising juniors who I considered a close friend is treating me like shit and I've just been coming back over and over like a dumb dog. Anyways, the last straw was after I have been treating her nicer than almost all of my friends she posted things on her blog (and quiz) that make me come up as a sex-obsessed immature pervert, that's not worth anyone's time. Not only that, but I'm sick of the unearned criticisms that she dishes out at me every time we talk, after all I do is give her compliments. Anyways, if she ever wants me to even consider her a friend again, she has a hell of a lot of apologizing to do. I'm so sick of people like that.....  Anyhow, on a lighter note, I will make an audio post with Cassy as soon as I can get through to her. Also, the last quiz is now invalid, as the question on who I like no longer applies (in fact, it should be rephrased to, "Who have I lost all respect for and is a backstabber?") Well, that's it for now. I'm out....

Also, even if it looks like you have clicked on the link, trust me, it's new (it's just the same URL, but a new quiz). Anyhow,  urlLink here it is . If you get 100 on the first time...uhh....well....I'll let you make an audio post on my blog saying whatever you want. Well, that's it for now. I'm out.

      Well, today has been really slow....So, here are some crazy but true laws.       In Macomb, Illinois, it's illegal for a car to impersonate a wolf.      In Florida, anyone found underneath a sidewalk is guilty of disorderly conduct.      In Rumford, Maine, it's against the law to bite your landlord.      In Tennessee, it's illegal to drive a car while sleeping.      In New Jersey, it's illegal to slurp your soup.      In Marshalltown, Iowa, it's against the law for a horse to eat a fire hydrant.      So, people, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't drive while asleep. Not only is it illegal, it's morally wrong.   &nbsp;

        Well, things have been really strange lately. One of my friends sounds like she's dying...but I'm not sure I have much sympathy after some things she said to me. On a much happier note, nothing worked out how I wanted, but now that I have things cleared out with that one person, I think I might possibly have a slight chance. Maybe.        &nbsp;    Now for the lyrics to the song we are gonna do for the talent show.        &nbsp;  well i thought about the army  dad said, son you're fucking high  and i thought, yeah there's a first for everything  so i took my old man's advice  three sad semesters  it was only fifteen grand spent in bed  i thought about the army  i dropped out and joined a band instead  grew a moustache and a mullet  got a job at chic-fil-a  citing artistic differences  the band broke up in may  and in june reformed without me  and they'd got a different name  i nuked another grandma's apple pie  and hung my head in shame  i've been thinking a lot today  i've been thinking a lot today  oh, i think i'll write a screenplay  oh, i think i'll take it to LA  oh, i think i'll get it done yesterday  in this time of introspection  on the eve of my election  i say to my reflection  god, please spare me more rejection  'cause my peers, they criticize me  and my ex-wives all despise me  try to put it all behind me  but my redneck past is nipping at my heels  i've been thinking a lot today  i've been thinking a lot today  i've been thinking a lot today  i thought about the army...      &nbsp;      &nbsp;

       Remember the funk band I was in last year for the talent show? We got 2nd place, and I was the only freshman in the whole thing. Great stuff. Well, with the class of '04 gone, I decided I wanted to do something similar anyways. So, The International Funk Conspiracy Part Two will hopefully come to be. Right now, I want to use Daniel, Tory, and Anne, but I'm not sure. There is a ton of work I gotta do if I want it to work.   urlLink  This   &nbsp;is the  very  basic and rough idea of what I want to do. Listen to the whole thing, the best part is towards the end. There are lyrics to, but I think I'm gonna make it more jazzy, change the instrumentation, and ignore the lyrics altogether. Let me know your thoughts. I'm out.

I&nbsp;caught my gay co-worker up to some shananagins with his "partner" in the back room at work today.

      Well my mysterious anonymous fan, as is the reason for most of my extended periods of absence, I have been grounded for stupid reasons. Glass not in dishwasher. Table not clean. Dog jumped. Dog barked, ect. The list goes on and on. Only reason I am able to post this now is that I'm at a friend's house. However, being that I don't see getting the computer back in the foreseeable future, I will begin with some fairly constant audio posts. Now...What has been happening lately....  Cassy isn't moving. That's one important thing. Kinda weird, I went all year thinking that at the end I'd be saying goodbye, but now it's two more years with her around. Definitely a good thing, just weird.  A God forsaken commie nearly got me fired. The damned russkie, (her name is Zemifra) told the manager that I "barked" at her and was making her do everything on her own. The manager came out and let me know if I piss her off again and she quits I'm fired. In truth, some crazy guy had pulled me aside and I was just trying to earn a tip. I got my revenge later though, when she started to choke on some bread. Then she started throwing up and crying saying she wanted to be back in Russia with her mother.  I also bought a watch. And so concludes this long anticipated post. I bid you all farewell for x amount of time. 'Till then......I'm out.

      Umm, okay. Dustin keeps pressuring me to update with whatever. Peer pressure is Dustin's fault. I'm talking to Ponder because I'm going to quote him in a second. There's a whole lotta fireworks goin' on outside right now. I was just in Grandview watching 'em. When I was in Florida, I saw a firework stand on the side of the road called, "Betty's Fireworks: The Biggest Bang In Town!" Hmm...pretty ironic, huh? Enough for now....I'm just going to sit hurr and wait for Ponder to find me a decent quote. Uh oh, he's typing; OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 So, Ponder says:  PigsIsBeautifull:   Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree? I travel the world And the seven seas-- Everybody's looking for something. Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you Some of them want to abuse you Some of them want to be abused.  -Lacie

      Well, I've been grounded two weeks. That explains why I haven't posted. By the way, screw Independence Day, today is Appendix Day. One year ago now Micheal Dill wished death upon me and God heard his cry. Everyone wish me happy Appendix Day! I'll post recent happenings later. FOR DANIEL....I'M OUT!  By the way, Cassy, if you read this, please forgive me, after we talked I thought, and even if I didn't mean it the way it came out I realized I did wrong and hurt you. I just want things to be how they were before.
