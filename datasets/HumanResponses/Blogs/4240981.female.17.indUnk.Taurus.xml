      It seems like I have so much to do in so little time! How can school be almost here already?  Yesterday I ran over to school with Greg to try to fix the locker shelf situation. Sadly, my master plan didn't work but it just occured to me in the car today that maybe I can con Nick into trimming down my shelves...hmmmm... I talked to my counselor about some college stuff as well. It's weird because I have to think about some options that I never even thought would be there. I just wish I knew where I would end up in a year right now without having to go through all the applications! After stopping by school I went over to say goodbye to Stina. As sad as I am to see her and everyone else go, and it'll be weird not being able to just call them and have them come over, I feel more okay with them leaving this year. I already know how my friendships with people that left last year have held up and I think that my friendships with the people leaving this year are strong enough to handle it. I still fully expect Jules to call me when she starts dating and Stina to call when she makes the shows and Garth well...he just better call me! At least now I know what to expect. And hey, it's only a hour and a half drive! After that I went to babysit my cousin Jack for the rest of the day. It was really fun because he lives out in Boston and I've missed him growing up (well, he's two so not really grown up yet, but still). He's a really active kid though! Good thing he goes to bed early! Today I went out to lunch with my friend Steph from church, who I throughly enjoy. I've missed her! After that I went to Archiver's and I got a membership! So now I get 15% off  and  a free tote bag! I don't get it yet, but when they get a new shipment in I will! Cut to a couple hours later and I spent quality time shopping with Kevin Fields. Sadly, not much luck at Old Navy. We watched the Olympics with Julie and then Jules and I met up with Rachel, Joel, and Sean. It was good talking with them! I don't like the fact that Rachel misses Scotland a lot, but since she can't be there this year, I'm really glad that she'll be around for a semester. I've missed her!

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY JEFF!  Well, aside from hanging out with my friends a little later (whoooo Olympics and Jeff's birthday!), today wasn't particularly fun either. I feel slightly more resolved...but still. My mom told me a while ago that I'm a very logical person, so I just really want to there to be a perfect plan to fix everything. The problem is that there's no such thing. And I can't even tell you how many times I've been crying and upset telling Mr. U about something and he's said "Sarah, you can't make everyone happy." So I always feel bad if how I feel clashes with other people. I want to constantly be okay with everything and smile and talk but it just...doesn't work that way. I guess all I can do is try my best. I just still feel like that isn't good enough.  So today I was thinking about how fast things change. Exactly a year ago today (well the 17th...I'm posting a few minutes after but whatever) anyways, so exactly a year ago today I started dating someone. And just to think about how much has changed since then absolutely blows my mind. Exactly a year ago I was freaking out about the first TC meeting because I had to sit up on the stage. I was deathly nervous but soooo excited for Proposals. Dan called me on days that he knew something big was happening, just to see how it went. I was training for FMP. I didn't even know my baby brother. I had no idea I was going to be really sick this year. I had no idea my sister would be really sick. I was dealing with close friends going to college for the first time. It was really weird when I was at Ashley's today because all her stuff was by the door and I remember a year ago when I was in her room and she was packing. Thinking about it, this has probably been the worst year of my life. But I'm grateful for it. Even though it's hurt a lot, I've learned so much. I've lost some people, but I've gained some too. I think I'm finally starting to learn to do what's best for me. I may not be good at it yet, but at least I can recognize if something isn't healthy. It's just crazy how fast a year goes...and how much changes.  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.

       Well today   started out being really good! I went downtown with Cass, Al, Alex, Greg, and Audrey (sorry Kevin!) and although I wasn't allowed to buy anything Al held my hand and all was well. And hey, it's not like I wasn't just there :). We took an early train home and went over to Alex's and can I just say that I enjoy Mrs. Griffith more every time I see her! Quality mom. So then we headed over to Stina's for her going away party, but I'm exceedingly glad that I didn't have to say goodbye to her today, I'm stopping by Weds. So anyways, Stina's. Well...I had lots of fun times with friends and it was good to see everyone in one place again but...there was some stress. My friends were all really great tonight though (and Mama Belgio). It's good to know they care so much. As much as I try to handle things well, there are some things no one seems to know how to do. I try to think about it in a hundred different ways and it can all make sense and I have the perfect way of dealing with things, but when the problem is staring me right in the face I freeze. I want so badly to just smile and talk and act like I don't care but I do. I guess it would be one thing if you grow apart from a friend and just gradually don't feel like you can't talk to them about important things anymore. But when it's sudden...it's hard...really hard. I feel like I've lost a lot this year.

       Hey guys! Well, everyone else is getting these blogs so I figured, what the heck. Well, I've had a really hard week but at the same time an amazing week! I got some news Tues that was pretty hard to swallow, but instead of sitting there in my house moping around I called Alex and Alicia and was like ummmm...so can we hang out? It didn't take me long to cheer up a little. I still have my moments, but as long as I think about it the right way, it's alright. I have to really start thinking about what's best for me too. I just have a feeling that I may be handling this better than some people which is a little hard considering the situation. Well, we'll see! So anyways, that was the crap part. Moving on! So I was with them all on Tuesday and we just ended up hanging out at Alex's house. Wednesday night I was really excited because I was planning on making smores in my fireplace but then we went over to Greg's and made smores over a real fire because despite what Mr. U says, I think I could die from the gas in my fireplace! Who knows. It was really good to see Amy Starkweather and Brian Martin again, I enjoy them! Thursday Alex, Sarah S. and I went into the city and I got lots of really fun clothes! I'm excited that blazers are out this season, as is purple corderoy (I got a skirt!) And I got a jean jacket which excites me because I love them, even if I've been informed that I don't look good in them...only by one person however, b/c the general opinion on Thurs was quite good. Thanks for helping me pick stuff out guys! Moving on to Friday I met up with Greg, Karin, and Alex at registration. Overall, my schedule is pretty good, I'm really glad that Karin has 6th hour lunch with me so we can go out! Then I had brunch with them and Peter and mucked around downtown w/ Alex. I went to Steak and Shake with a bunch of people and I'm really glad that I got to see Alison before she left, I really miss her a lot. Sadly, I didn't concentrate on saying goodbye to her much b/c I thought I was going to see her when I dropped off brownies later but she wasn't home. Oops! At least she knows I was thinking about her! Then I went out shopping w/ Jules and her mom, quality time there! Yesterday I felt really sick (crappy Julie Krause did it! but that's okay b/c I like her) but then I felt a lot better later and went over to Greg's. So my dad was kind of pissed b/c I was supposed to have family time but I was sick when he asked me about it! Oh well, he's over it already. But anyways, so last night we discovered that you should  never  play poker with Alex but other than that, good bonding time! Alright well long first post, but it's really good to know that even if there are sometimes crappy circumstances, I still have great friends there for me. Thanks for making this a good week overall!
