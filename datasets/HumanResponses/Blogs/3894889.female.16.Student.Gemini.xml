      Watch out, then, because you do not know what day your Lord will come.  - Matthew 24:42God Speaks Bible    An old legend recounts how Satan once called three of his top aides to a special meeting so that they might make a plan about how to stop the effectiveness of a particular group of people. One of the aides, Resentment, proposed, "We should convince them there is no God." Satan sneered at Resentment and replied, "That would never work. They know there's a God."   Bitterness then spoke up: "We'll convince them that God does not really care about right or wrong." Satan thought about the idea for a few moments but then rejected it. "Too many know that God does care," he finally said.   Malice then proposed his idea: "We'll let them go on thinking there is a God and that He cares about right and wrong. But we will keep whispering that there is no hurry, there is no hurry, there is no hurry."   Satan howled with delight! The plan was adopted, and Malice was promoted to an even higher position in Satan's malevolent hierarchy.   If you have never given your heart to God, NOW is the time to reach out to Him. Don't be deceived. Today is the day of decision; tomorrow may be too late.

      I have set you an example for you, so that you will do just what I have done for you.  - John 13:15     The story is told of a Christian missionary who was lost at sea and by chance, washed up on an island near a remote native village. Finding him half dead from starvation and exposure, the people of the village nursed him back to health. He subsequently lived among the people for some twenty years. Since he could not speak their language, he could not confess his faith or preach any sermons to them.   However, when the people were sick, he attended them. When they were hungry, he gave them food. When they were lonely, he kept them company. He taught the ignorant and came to the aid of those who were wronged.   One day missionaries came to the village and began talking to the people about a man called Jesus. After hearing what they had to say of Jesus' ministry and teachings, they insisted that He had been living among them for twenty years.   If you have experienced the miracle of God's love and grace, you may be anxious to share that with others. Just remember that your words will never be as important as your actions. Those around you will know that what you have found is real by witnessing the difference it makes in your life.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  if you want to find out about my weekend then go to xanga.com/aajunkieintrainin.

      We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him.  - Romans 8:28   One Christmas Eve, a man was driving two young women to church when they came upon a multiple-car collision. They were unable to stop on the slick road and slammed into the back of a car. One of the girls, Donna, was thrown face-first through the windshield. The jagged edges of the broken windshield made two deep gashes in her left cheek.   At the hospital, the doctor on duty happened to be a plastic surgeon. He took great care in stitching Donna's face. Nevertheless, the driver was devastated by what had happened.   A short time later Donna's family moved away. Fifteen years passed before the driver happened to see Donna's mother, who gave him the following report. "Donna was so intrigued by her hospital stay that she became a nurse, got a good job at a hospital, met a young doctor, married him, and then had two children. God took a stormy day and created a beautiful rainbow. Donna told me that the accident was the best thing that could have happened to her!"   God is not the initiator of tragedy and suffering in our lives, but He is always there to bring some good to every situation. If you are in the midst of a fierce storm, don't lose hope. Look for the rainbow!

         todays devo brought to you by godspeak.com             I will answer him because I am merciful.      - Exodus 22:27  God Speaks Bible             Many people see God as a stern judge, just waiting to pounce on those who break His laws. Others see Him as the supreme power of the universe, distant and remote, uninvolved in their lives. But there are also those who enjoy a loving, open relationship with their heavenly Father.   How we perceive God has a direct impact on how we pray. If we see God as a stern judge, we may not be brave enough to speak to Him at all. If we see Him as distant and remote, we may dismiss Him from our lives completely. However, if we see God as our loving, generous, heavenly Father, we are likely to talk to Him about everything.    How do you see God? The Bible says that He is filled with compassion toward us and is ready to hear us when we call out to Him for help. Yes, one day He will be the great judge of all the earth. But you have been invited to know Him first as Father and friend.    God has made an eternal commitment to love and nurture you. At great personal cost, He has opened the lines of communication so that you can speak to Him without fear. He has promised to hear every word. What are you waiting for?             Well today the kids are all gettin baptised i might take pictures havent' decided yet i know my g-ma is takin her camcorder to record it then my lil cousin justin is gonna go with us. he is so cute.

      Well lets see i jus got this so i could post comments i hope i remember to post in this thing.  Saturday, July 10, 2004 devo:  What no one ever saw or heard, what no one ever thought could happen, is the very thing God prepared for those who love him.   - 1 Corinthians 2:9 God Speaks Bible   In Beyond Ourselves, author Catherine Marshall tells about a problem she faced as a young person. She and her family lived in a small town in West Virginia that had undergone severe financial struggles in the aftermath of the 1929 stock-market crash. The two railroad shops, which were the only industry in town, were nearly shut down. Even with the promise of a small work scholarship and the $125 she had saved, Catherine was several hundred dollars short of what she needed to attend college.  One night her mother came to her room and found her sobbing. Her dreams of college seemed dashed. Her mother suggested that they bow together and ask for God's help. "Whenever we ask God for something that is His will, He hears us," her mother said. "If He hears us, then He grants the request we have made. So you and I can rest on that promise."   Soon, Catherine's mother was offered a job writing the history of their county. She made enough in this job to pay for Catherine's college expenses with a little to spare.   Do you have plans and goals for your life that seem impossible to achieve? Ask God to help. He will open doors of opportunity for you that you never imagined. He is committed to your success.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Well lets see i finally got my lawn mowed after talkin about it for 2 days. oh well atleast it got done before i had to leave. Well lets see I didn't wake up till after 11 today and had to be at the park by 12:30 and still had to go get amy's baby shower gift from my mom's and wrap it and didn't get into the shower till after 11:30 but i ended up not wrappin the gift cause i couldn't get into my house to do it. oh well. Well i got home from that at about 2:30 then sat here most of the day then at about 7 i started on the lawn and was done with it all by 8:30 and that included taken a break. so i was happy i got it done. Well tomorrow dylan, skylar, dusty, jordan, and chelsea all get baptised and there all my cousin's i dont' knwo if anyone else is gettin baptised or not. it is taken place in a pond cause we dont' have a baptisimal last time we had a baptism to do we rented the pool at the middle school and done it there. so that is kewl.
