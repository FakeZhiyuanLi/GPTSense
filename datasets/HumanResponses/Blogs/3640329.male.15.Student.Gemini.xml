            It has been described as Asia's Best Kept Secret. Now the secret is out. Sarawak is the place for history, mystery, romance and exotic adventures. The land of the fabled White Rajahs, the hornbill and the orang utan, Sarawak is the largest State in Malaysia and by far the most exotic.  Its rainforest, the size of Austria, houses the world's richest and most diverse ecosystem. It is also home to the world's largest flower, the Rafflesia, the size of a coffee table, squirrels and snakes that fly, deer the size of cats, plants that eat insects (and small mammals) and species of flora and insects still waiting to be discovered.   More importantly, this ancient virgin rain forest is home to 27 ethnic groups; people each with their own distinct language, culture and lifestyle. Their ancient cultures may differ but they have one thing in common, their warmth and hospitality. You can experience this by spending a night in one of their longhouses listening to legends that go back to the Stone Age. Whether it's an lban, Bidayuh, Melanau or one of the many Orang Ulu groups you stay with, the welcome will be just as warm.   In the towns you can mingle with Malays or the many different Chinese communities that have made Sarawak their home.   Arrive in Sarawak and you step into adventure. How much adventure is up to you. You can stroll for a morning in a national park near your hotel, or you can trek for days through pristine jungle, sleeping each night in a different longhouse. If walking is not your style try mountain biking the jungle trails. Want to get out of the sun? Spend days exploring the world's most extensive cave system, 310 kilometers of passages with more waiting to be found.   If history thrills you, visit caves that were inhabited 40,000 years ago, learn how Indian and Chinese merchants traded for Sarawak's exotic products centuries before the first Europeans came here. Hear stories of princes and pirates, of headhunters and explorers.   But, if that is more excitement than you need, relax on our beaches by the South China Sea, scuba dive off reefs where you will be alone with the sea, or just enjoy a round of golf on one of our excellent courses. Sarawak has something for everyone and a welcome for all.   After all, "Selamat Datang", "Selamat Datai" are some of the different ways to say welcome in the many languages of Sarawak.
