      One minute until the new issue officially goes live, ya know. I mean, it's been up for an hour, but you've been waiting for midnight because you're obviously on the honor system.  More here in the next day or so. I've decided that after two days of edits and layout, sleeping might be nice!

      Okay, just a few quick thoughts about Reagan passing away:  Of all the imagery that I've seen on the television over the last week (including the two mornings that The Early Show did an "Extended" version and pre-empted by ritual watching of Regis and Kelly), I think the the most poignant one was the one I only saw once.  With Reagan's casket set up in the Capitol Rotunda, Gorbachev came to say goodbye. Now that was an image the kind of hit me -- a man who was once the President's bitter enemy, then cautious colleague, and lastly a sort of co-bringer to the end of the cold war, stood in the US Capitol building, in front of a flag-draped coffin, and paid his respects. A very powerful bit of counterpoint in my mind.  As for the whole argument as to whether Reagan was one of the greatest Presidents we ever had, my take is this: Okay, his administration did more to damage public education than most in recent history. That irks me, as does the fact that he drove the Republican party to new extremeties of the right. But regardless of what you thought of the man's politics, I think there's no argument in that he gave a command performance in the role of President. He was the kind of President that they ALL need to be -- he gave America back its sense of pride and esteem. He made us care about our country, yet not in the we've-been-wounded defensive patriotism that's been around since 9/11. Reagan, being the "Great Communicator," made it grow from the very soil of the country.  I'm not a student of politics, nor am I particularly qualified to speak historically about it. But I grew up right in the middle of it, and I remember how it felt.

      Hey, hey! Who's looking forward to a FAn-tastic week at the office!??    ::crickets::    Yeah, me too. Anyhow, I'm jsut trying to cope with a little bit of the ol' "why the hell is everyone on vacation, and how do I get some of that" feelings. Just been in a grind--a good, steady grind--but I can slowly feel my batteries starting run a little on the low side. Couple that with the fact that I've actually been feeling creative lately, and you end up with a nice feeling of "man, I could use about a week jsut to bum around and work on my own personal projects."    But it will not be this week. Oh well.    New issue's looking good, though! I should have all the edits and layout done by tonight, which will leave me a nice amount of time for spit and polish. My compliments to the pool of contributors, as they really turned in some great stuff this month. Gold star!

      Lo and behold, I have written the rough of the August column, and is now in my lovely editor's inbox. I was pleasantly surprised that it had nothing to do with any of the previous posts. And verily I say unto you, it does not suck.    Also, I now have Gmail, and lo it was indeed good! Thanks be to girlfriend for putting out a plea for help on her own blog, although I'm sure it was more to get me to stop bugging her about it. =)

      Okay, here's something that might seem random. I was watching "Hackers" again last night, and it occurs to me that I've STILL never really had a consistent handle. I've got a variety of login names, sure, but I've never really stuck with one real awesome identity. I guess the closest I've come is my fark.com handle of "ForbiddenDonut," which doesn't really sound that badass. So I brainstormed for part of today, and I've decided that my awesome hax0rs ident is going to be "Johnny Killswitch."  Uh huh. Hack the planet.  Banging around a couple of ideas for next month's column. Nothing concrete yet -- here are my top three ideas as of right now:  1) Your life defined by what your favortie comic strip is.  2) Shaving off my hair  3) Something really wacky. Only issue being I have no idea what this might be.  So, stay tuned, I guess and see what it ends up being...

      Now, as a supplement to this month's column:  I'm told by she-that-is-my-girlfriend that I should be getting my Gmail invite tomorrow. This now leaves me with two rather pressing concerns.  First off, I've got to go to the trouble (albeit pleasurable) of picking what my new address/user ID is going to be. It's not going to be something using my name, because that's what my domain registrations are for. So I'm going to pick something fun and with potential for anonymity. I thought about it at length yesterday, and here's my short list thus far (subject to availability, of course):  1) aspiringsupervillain@gmail.com 2) screwtape@gmail.com 3) burninator@gmail.com 4) ForbiddenDonut@gmail.com 5) pvenkman@gmail.com  The second issue to contend with is the "rational voice" that I mentioned in my column. As much as I try to ignore it, it still has a point -- what in the name of Thor's ball-peen hammer am I going to do with another email account?  So I'm going to now sit down and map out all my email usage, tinker with some forwarding, and maybe ::gasp:: axe a few of these things out of usage. Sure as hell beats actual work, now doesn't it?

      In relation to this month's column:  I went to the Reds game yesterday, and had to suffer through the usual rendition of you-know-what. As a point of clarification, friends, you don't remove your hat for that song. It's not the National Anthem, nor is it in any way the offical song of any organization you belong to. Thus ends today's PSA.  In other news, can someone explain to me why I don't read anymore? I've been sort of cleaning my apartment, and I keep coming across these stack of books that I've purchased or borrowed, and I've cracked most of them. Is it because every time I sit still long enough to read, I fall asleep? It's gotten to the point where I can't even open the latest Harry Potter (kindly on loan from the Heather Grovemiller collection). And that's a children's book, you know... I can't even get around to tearing though a CHILDREN'S BOOK?  I've decided to blame Robert Jordan. I've been a fan of his Wheel Of Time series for almost 10 years now, tore though all the back reading (five books of 300-500 pages each) when I became acquinted, and dutifully bought the new ones when they became available. But after waiting two years for "Crossroads of Twilight" (book ten) to come out, I cracked it open, read the opening and realized I didn't have a clue who any of the friggin' minor characters were anymore, because the whole thing had gotten so drawn-out and complicated.  To really do the right thing, I should go back and re-read the last couple books--if not the whole series. And you know, I think that's when my passion for consistent reading died. I just didn't have it in me to go back though all that. So "Crossroads" is still sitting on my shelf, unread, and it's sort of damned up all this stuff behind it. I've got book constipation.  You know, I'm trying to think of a "Reader's 'Digest'" joke here, but I guess I just don't have the mental fibre to come up with one. Couple of good concepts, but nothing beyond a few bits of roughage.
