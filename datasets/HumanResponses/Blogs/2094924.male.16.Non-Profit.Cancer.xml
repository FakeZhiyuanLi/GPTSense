      Tonight was great! The car/pirate ship was awesome. It's too bad I didn't get to go to the party afterwards, but it's all good. There's another one tomorrow night that I wanted to go to MORE. So there.  Erika is my best friend ever. She lives in Sandusky and talks to me more that a lot of people in Lapeer (that's where I live!). Like Danielle for instance. She will not talk to me at all on the internet. It's always "I can't talk to ya, talk to you later." What a load of poop.  That was the end of the marking period today... I think I did all right. I hope I did.  CoNfLiCt Of InTeReSt? No, I gOt InTeReSt In CoNfLiCt.

      The "project" is almost finished.... I LOVE IT, it looks sweet. I can't wait!  It sure doesn't take her long, does it? It seems Becky already has another unsuspecting guy lined up... pray for him, please. He probably doesn't know what he's getting into.  How many times do I have to tell people that I was actually GLAD to be kept back on JV this year? I mean, yeah, I got screwed out of a spot warming the varsity bench, big deal. They sucked this year. As in 2-12-2 sucked. We, however, were 6-7-3. Booyah.  YoU dOn'T hAvE a ChOiCe In ThE mAtTeR: gEt YoUr HaNdS uP!

      D00d! This Pirates Who Don't do... is going to BE SWEET! I just have to figure out the costume thing, but it's still gonna be sweet!  Praise God. My Bio grade is back up to an A.  This just in: going to the dentist still sucks. No matter what flavor the fluoride, it still tastes nasty. No matter what posters are on the ceiling, I'm still concentrating on the person poking my mouth.   If I wErE a NiNjA, yOu'D bE dEaD rIgHt NoW!

      So sorry for the confusion. The trick is actually called a ROASTBEEF, not meatloaf. Still sounds funny though.  I did my first two hours of NHS community service today. Tutoring, games, you name it, I did it. I had no idea what I was doing, but I did it anyway. Hehe. It was fun.  It's so friggin WET AND COLD! Why does it have to be this way?  I hate it when I stand right next to people, or right in front of them... not a word out of them. Most of the people I meet are pretty friendly, and I think I'm pretty friendly too. Unfriendliness gets on my nerves.  InTeLlIgEnT, mAtUrE, cHrIsTiAn GuRlZ: gEt In LiNe!

      I am so bored. And I've got connective tissue drawings comin out of my yin yang. Today was sooo exciting (yay).  I dunno how I'm gonna get my crap together before Halloween. You see, me and my friend Kevin are gonna be the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything. Catchy, yes? But I don't know how to dress like a pirate, so I guess I'm sunk. Thar she flippin blows.  The music on Tony Hawk (see previous) was bugging everybody, since it is a demo and only has one song. So we tried turning off the music, but like the Devil it turned itself back on again with mysterious voodoo magic. So we had to stomp the devil game by turning down the main volume. Goodbye sweet sloppy trick sound. At least when my brother tries a Meatloaf (it's a trick, isn't that awesome?) and lands it sloppy, I can always say, "That was a sloppy meatloaf." So he laughs and screws up. Again, to point out the obvious, I am easily amused.  SaFeTy CoMeS fIrSt! Ya, ThEn PuLl ThE tRiGgEr.

      My brother got a new obsession! It's called Tonyhawkproskatertwophilia. It's not even the full game, either. It's really quite sad. But the noise that lets you know you pulled a sloppy trick is really funny, it's like a scratchy recordy thing. I dunno why it's so funny, but it is.  I wish I was a sophomore or a freshman. Then I would understand their jokes. There goes that "sloppy trick" sound again! I love it!  I was so happy that I got an extra hour of sleep this morning. We should have that every day. It would be the coolest thing.  YeStErDaY iS jUsT a MeMoRy In My HeAd... He PaVeD tHe WaY aNd DeLiVeReD mE oF mY dEbT, mY hInDsIgHt Is 20/20 NoW sO iT's SaId... CaN yOu BeLiEvE iT?

      Hm... got back from Gladwin today smelling like burning leaves and body odor. Dude. I wanted to go to Alli's party. I wouldn't have come home from THERE smelling like this. But... never say never.  I was so happy that we didn't have to miss the Spartans game today because there WASN'T ONE! Ha! I even got home in time to catch the last half of MXC.   I should take a shower... but I probably won't. Pray for the neighbors.  DoN't DoUbLe TaKe, YoU cAn Go To ThE sToRe- AnD iF tHeY'rE sOlD oUt, TeLl 'Em PlEEz GeT mOrE!

      Hey, I'm slackin here! Okay, after a whole week, and it's been juicy. Comme un bon steak.   Just got back from a conference in Chicago... that was sooooo sweet! I had so much fun! We played laser tag and laughed till our sides hurt and everything. Good times.  The only bitter part about it was the end of me and Becky. I mean, that might sound like our friendship ended, but it didn't. In fact, I think it may be better this way. I'm MUCH better at being a friend anyway. Point stated... no more girlfriends till I'm married.  Call it plugging if you want... you people have to hear Tobymac: Remixed if you haven't already. It's off the hizzle. For shizzle, my nizzle. No dizzle.   ThOuGh YoU sWeAr YoU'rE tRuE, I sTiLl PiCk My FrIeNdS oVeR yOu.

      Well. Day numba two. It got cold... real quick. I was freezin my (expletive) off at practice today. Last practice... whee! At least Kyle was cool and gave me his sweatshirt cuz he was getting "hot." Showoff.  My dog still stinks like that swamp-thing she jumped in. It may seem cruel, but I really don't wanna pet her.  Geebus. It's raining again. I do  NOT  wanna go to school tomorrow. But who does?  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm...... ! crap. I forgot my French homework... pray for me!

      Hey I just got this new blog thing it's sweet. No, I forgot you can do this kinda stuff. So I'm gonna do it now. And if someone makes a lot of money off my life story, I better get paid or someone's gonna drop. Anyway. Our soccer team won again today... 4-0; we're doing awesome, well at least now we are.  I gotta think of a song to sing with Nick, man. My mom shot down "Above" by Pillar... blowing out all the old people isn't a high priority with her.  Becky and I decided to hit the restart button... going back to the point where talking amongst our friends almost killed our relationship. It was her idea, too. She may be smarter than me... look out.

      Hey, I'm still alive, believe it or not! Now. My cousin is living with us now. He's a crack up. There's some family crap going on... blah. He's gonna be like our family now.   Isn't it wierd? Becky's  talking  to me now! It's great... most of the time. Hehehe. But really,  I'm gaining lost ground  here.  No MaTtEr WhAt YoU sAy, YoUr Ex-BoYfRiEnD iS sTiLl A lOsEr.

      I feel wierd with my head all different. I like it. I should do this more often.  I'm doing a project on the Manhattan Project... it's depressing. Like, when I start typing about all the people that got killed. It's almost frustrating. By the way, it was around 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima alone. Sobering, eh?  I'm starting to fight the Styx out of my head. Slowly but surely.  Parent teacher conferences are tonight... I get to see my report card when my mom gets home. It may sound stupid to you, but I'm actually worried about what my parents will say. I mean, I don't think that this report card is going to be like all the other ones. Pray for me.

      Oh man. The next time that a group of people, such as our quiz team, decides to make idiots out of ourselves, we should do it when nobody's around. Nobody. We sucked today. 0-4 sucked. WE WENT ALL THE WAY TO LANSING TO SUCK. Boy, that's awesome.  That's basically all I did today. Nothing real important. Humph. Oh! I did throw a piece of fake bacon at my brother. I'm tired of him getting Styx stuck in my head!  We ShALL kIll GaToR, aNd EnD tHe StYx! STOP SINGING THAT FREAKING SONG!

      The mellowing of the out continues (see previous). From now until forever. Hehehe. Ain't no stoppin me now.  I'm not kidding, I cannot be stopped. Muhahahahaha!  See the funny poem I got in a forward?: A peach is a peach, a plum is a plum, a kiss ain't a kiss without some tongue. So open your mouth, close your eyes, and give your tongue some exercise!  I think it's funny, if not that truthful at all. humph.

      Things are looking up in this life. I think I'm starting to return to emotiostasis... aka I'm mellowed out again! I'm so happy. You should be too.  Funny story: At the dinner table, my mom, Gator and I were discussing how Gator doesn't like shots. "I hate it because it hurts more in the arm, where there's muscle! See all the muscle? It would hurt less if it were fat." Then my mom says, "Then maybe they should have stuck it in your head." It was so funny. I could not stop laughing. It may not be funny to you. That's okay, you'll recover.   I made a sign that says: NO LOAFING and put it in the teen room where we practice for quiz. I dunno, it might help our team. Don't count on it.  This is my rhyme I'm workin on, so don't take it!: See people worshipin their hair and clothes, buyin fast cars and blastin steroes, pickin up hoes and rolling in the dough; I don't want any of those, I want my Savior who ROSE!

      Today was one of the rare good Tuesdays....  Except for the fact that I'm stuck in this game, Renegade. I can't beat level 6 on Soldier. Il me fait fache. Oh well, if life was a video game, I'd be waiting for the level to reload so I can try again...  Kids Cafe was actually pretty cool... but this third grader swore at me. It was kinda awkward because I'm used to hearing it from my classmates, not third graders! I made the most of it anyway...  I think I'm actually going to ace the quiz in AP US History tomorrow. Humph. Call me crazy, but I actually know this stuff.  OmNiVoReS fOr MeDiOcRiTy!

      I'm soooo tired. I didn't get a wink of sleep last night. I was trying, know that, but those people who still had energy left for some unknown reason (Ben, Erika, Cody, Zoomer, you know who you are) kept waking me up! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!  Cody needs to be in my blog. He's my homedog. And also, whenever I wear this sweet shirt that reads CHOKE ON IT LAPEER EAST, he tries to strip it off me in public. So now it's also guys that can't keep their hands off me. But seriously, he's cool... in some respects...  I'm living in a nightmare where everybody likes losers. Don't ask me why. It's my nightmare, I don't have any control.  Okay. Enough is enough. There were only a select few that went on the Chicago trip. I was one of them. Nick was as deserving as anybody, leave him alone. This was not a "youth group event," as Pastor Paul put it. It will probably be open to more next year. I'm sorry that everyone couldn't go; but there's no use bringing people down and complaining about it. I feel better now.  I'm having trouble getting my groove back. Maybe I should ask Stella how she did it.  PrEsSiN oN, aLl My DiStReSs Is GoInG, gOiNg, GoNe; PrEsSiN oN, pReSsIn On...

      That's right. I fell off my chair. Big stinkin deal.  Tomorrow is New Year's Eve. The day after is... New Year's Day. In between: a barn-burner of a party! Can't wait. As long as I remember how to get to Jessy's house.  I didn't know there was a website devoted to degrading our national leader! www.misleader.com I think... how completely horrible! I mean, we're supposed to unite behind our President, not trash him. Liberal screwballs.    I didn't     mean to       lead you on...

      I'm gonna do the whole blog usin nothing but lyrics...  Hehehe.  It's burning up in here! Just relax, take a breath... it's okay.  But I can't get there from here. I'm sick of smiling, and so is my jaw. I fell in love with this beautiful girl... if it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt. Softer than the lightest snows, watch her as the moment slows, in my face the door will close... and there she goes! The fear of never falling in love, and the tears after losing what you thought love was; like the dirt swept up under the rug. I don't know man, but I'm here to take the game back. The game is officially mine, OFFICIALLY MINE! So am I still waiting? I'll show the world! In the end it'll be all right. Open your eyes, it's time you realized and reached out for the prize! So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice that I could be so foolish, thinkin I'm all right. If only I could find the words to say. I'd rather die than spend this night here without you; now every day is ugly without you. I'm not ashamed to let you know, cuz it's a shame to be ashamed! I'm gonna prove it to the world, so here I go! If you don't wanna say anything at all, I'm happy wondering. It's in your hands. The rest is up to you.

      That's right. The OLD meaning. The meaning without going to three places to celebrate. The meaning without going to Wal Mart on the 26th to trade in all the stuff that you didn't want. The meaning that still called it "Christmas Break" instead of "Winter Recess." The meaning that emphasized the birth of the world's Savior and family, and not holiday sales indexes and material things. I love that meaning. That meaning gave me more joy this holiday than any present could shake a stick at. More joy than seeing my relatives. More joy even than seeing someone open a present that I gave them, then see the smile on their face that tells you that you hit the nail right on the head. This joy is... supernatural. Sometimes you feel it when you wake up or pray. Sometimes it takes a work of God right in front of our faces to bring up this kind of joy within us. It's always there, just not always obvious.  When did this world steal my JOY?

      I'm in shock! I can't believe we finally got SADDAM. Everybody wants to put him to death. I think we can do better than that. You wanna know my suggestion?  Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway, dangit.  I think we should lock him in a white room. He gets a white sink, a white toilet, and a white pillow. All of his food is dyed white... and he gets the same food everyday. Eventually, the grief will kill him... if the back problems from sleeping on the floor don't kill him first.  Hehehe. He'll go nuts. Did you know that the normal human starts to lose his mind after about three days in solitary confinement?  Hehehe. x2    Etc.   :   A sign that makes people think that you know more than you actually do.

      Gator and I created a NEW game... HAND HOCKEY! It's like air hockey, kinda. You use your hands and try to swat a bottle cap into a ten-inch goal. Lots of fun. We turned our kitchen table into a huge hand hockey court/rink (undecided). Yeaaaaaaah baby.  I have uncovered the hidden treasure in Yahoo! LAUNCHcast radio! I turn it to the Christian Rock station whenever I get on now and hear SWEET music. I give it two bruised thumbs up (flippin hand hockey!).    Being consistent isn't always good.

      It's very late. I feel... tired. It's crazy, I know. Call your friends.  Kevin, Nick, (possibly Cody), and I are singing "Angels We Have Heard On High" during a Christmas program the Sunday after next. I'm going to pray: A) That Nick learns the chords for the bass B) That Cody can play drums so we sound decent C) That my voice doesn't crack and I don't saturate the platform with six gallons of manly perspiration and D) That the congregation will ike our new twist on the old French carol.

He can take on Jordan like he's cake. He also reminds me of a black Zach Koerner with an afro. Hehehe.  I did AWESOME on my Bio II test today. I, in lamen's terms, took it out back and beat it like a bad stepchild. It was a complete massacre. I feel good.    Why do slim chance and fat chance mean the same thing?

      Dad's flippin out over the computer again, so there's an ensuing wave of deleted programs. Why, oh why every time?  Somehow I've been designated the official "Youth Group CD Burner Operator." I've been charged with about 8 total copies of two CDs. Bloorg.  I actually feel sorry for Burt sometimes. If he could stick to one single task for an extended amount of time, he could get all his homework done in less than the normal FIVE hours.  That quiz was a bad idea. Two days in a row I've been blasted with "You have 23 unread message(s)." That ain't cool.    My music's got a foolproof warranty. Try it, don't like it, you don't have to listen- I'm not sure about a refund, but you're welcome to dis it!

Tomorrow is the last TFC concert for a whole month. That's not cool. I'm gonna miss you guys!  My cousin is cheating at a dinosaur hunting game. He's hacking away at a T-Rex with a bow. I'll let you know how he's doing later.   I'm so happy that my room is clean now. You can walk around and... move and stuff. It's a spiritual thing. It really is.  Burt's still going. Keep pluggin, buddy.  Maybe I should make my own CD. I think I need one. I have extras, ya know.  I don't think Burt's going to ever take this thing down. Oh well. It's the thought that counts, and the ginormous lizard is not pleased to have 50 arrows lodged in his back. Why can't we all just get along?

      James needs money, if you didn't already know. My dad gave me the run through on the car insurance, and it ain't pretty. If it wasn't bad enough that I HAVEN'T EVEN TAKEN DRIVER'S TRAINING YET. Sheesh.  I wrote an AWESOME SONG. And thanks to the omnipotent Kevin Lipsey, it has music too. And he says it ROCKS. Coming from a kid that's all about music, I'll take   that   as a compliment.  Working hard at school, workin hard at home, also. It seems like that's all I do anymore...

      www.homestarrunner.com/whatsinthebag.html    My pre-calc test today was kinda... traumatizing. I got halfway through the test trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, there were eraser rubbings all over, I think I might have been sweating. Sick, eh? I look at my calculator... I'm still in radians. No wonder I was getting them all wrong!  Get to go to TFC's tomorrow! It never gets old. I just love everything that goes on there... singin, acting, devo's, eating (btw, Durand has awesome lasagna), and hangin out. It was well worth camp (and how strenuous that was!).   My report card was withheld... I owe $80 in pay-to-play. Guess I'll have to look up my grades later.

      Because there's no other that can compare to STATE! That game last night was so good... came back from a 23 point deficit on Minnesota to win in overtime. That's a game, I don't care who your opponent is. You know what would happen if the Blue and Maize were down by 23? Their defense would take a crap and they'd lose by 36. That is what would happen.   Gotta go back to school tomorrow... bleh. I don't wanna! It's cold, and snowy... well, actually the snow isn't so bad anymore. It's got a kind of beauty to it, if you wanna call it that. You probably have to look beyond the ice part... now I'm just not making any sense at all. Crap. I was afraid this would happen.

Today was pretty cool, in the fact that I didn't have to do a freakin thing. Except shovel snow, which wasn't a big deal. Yep... only things I did included: I wrote a song (without music, just like the rest), I slept, ate, watched Fresh Prince and King of Queens, took a family poll on who should win the Super Bowl (go Pats!), and hacked apart orcs with good-old Gimli. In the computer, not my brain.   I really have nothing else to talk about. Today was pretty uninteresting.    What's stuck in my head:   "Here We Go Again" by The Hot Flashez    This is really frustrating! I'm getting really frustrated!

      Spring Arbor University found it in their heart to send yours truly a free t-shirt. I'm sold now. hehehe... like I wasn't before. Gator asked me why he didn't get a shirt. I told him, "They love me." -"Well, when do I get mine?" -"Maybe when you're older." I just love messing with him. It makes my day.  I am apalled at my recent laziness. I can't see how I was so fired up on Monday to start walking towards God, and now, six days later, I act as if I had forgotten everything I said. I've broken rules and hadn't felt remorse until now. This has got to end. I can't be perfect, but I can try; this brings me closer to God.    What's stuck in my head:   "More Everything" by MXPX    I can't think of a quote tonight... I'm really tired.

      That's right, they're taking over our world and there ain't a flippin thing we can do. There was a meeting at our school for a new club. This ain't your grandpappy's school club... it's a gay club. AT WEST. You'd think they'd meet at East, right? hehe sorry. I'm not kidding though, a lot of people are talking about picketing. And you know what? I'll be right there beside them if they do.  Every time I look at the Democratic lineup, I laugh. I can't help it. It is absolutely absurd to think that any one of those MORONS could ever take down Bush. Now... back in 2000 when all the primaries for Republicans were going on... my vote was on McCain. But of course, that vote didn't count. Alas, I was twelve. I say that to say this: I don't agree with everything that Bush says or does. I DO think that he does more for this country than Clinton ever did and any of the nominees could ever do.  He's got the freaking Presidential Seal on his cowboy boots! I'm glad we've got a cowboy on Pennsylvania Avenue.    Ya can't look a man in da hairy eyeball and tell him his whiskey's got too much sap!   - Albert Soady

      What a day! Too much thinking on my part was recommended... not needed and by not thinking about it at all has proven to make it easier on everybody.  "...love keeps no record of wrongs. It is not self-seeking..." Isn't that in the Bible somewhere? I hope certain members of my youth group look that up sometime...  Today has convinced me that Nick's composure is not great, but his resolve is beyond measure. He has the light of God in him, and it gives him wisdom.  I went to Seaton again today. I'm telling you this, teacher help is a lot of work, but it is very rewarding. Those kids are so cool. Just by being around them you feel like a superhero, because you   are   one to them. When you try to teach them, you can't use a conventional way of speech, you have to try to get down to their level so that they can do it without your help. It's easier said than done.    Da scroll, da scroll, da buttons, da buttons... scrollin so smooth, like da butter on a muffin.

      That's my new favorite song. It's just so cool!  The House brothers have joined our youth group, and with them brought all kinds of different, but familiar problems. Eh. We'll survive... we always do.  But it's just so STUPID! I can't believe so many disagreements can be started over TWO people joining the group. It's insane.  Anyway. I'm doing great... as in... never been better. My friends rock... no school tomorrow... it's all good. It's too bad nobody else feels the same.    The doctors say that I'm not crazy after all      The doctor said take two of these and give me a call

      Exams are finally over. Five Scantrons and a few small crises later, the first semester is over. I know I can say that I graduate next year... and a lot of people tell me, "Oh, you're so lucky. You get to graduate ahead of everyone else your age." That's a metric ton of bullcrap. You get to go to COLLEGE and do it all again, only more difficult.   Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.  Burt's leaving tomorrow. A part of me is happy to see such an annoyance gone, but the other part is reminded of what he's going back to: not much. I'm going to pray for him. It's all I can do now.

      I'm not kidding. In the morning... spilled some COCO WHEATS on my pants. Bad omen. Went to get a hair cut, ended up getting butchered. She doesn't know how to cut hair, so she gave me a load of crap. Cassie (my dog) ate my new earphones. The Spartans lost. Again. Today, quite frankly, SUCKED.  Tomorrow, Burt's coming back to live with us. Joy joy joy! Can't freaking wait.  I want school to come back. I want to see my TFC homies again. This is complete and utter madness.

      Quoth the Scoop, "I'll kill you!" And that's what I wanted to do today. Well, not exactly. But close. Gator and Nick just felt like being... (donkeys) today. I was gonna go over to the church for a funeral with them, but they left and I didn't even see them leave! I mean, sure, I could walk. But there was no, "Hey James, you wanna ride?" or, "Hey, are you coming?" So I just didn't go, I figured they didn't really want me to come. It seems that after they cleaned up after the funeral, they went over to parsonage and helped move furniture. And as a reward, they went to go see Miracle. That's right, Miracle. The movie I've been waiting a month to see, and they just blew me off.  Was I angry? Ticked off? FUMING? You freakin bet.  When they got home, I gave em an earful, for sure. I asked them, "Why did you just go over to the church without me?" And the response was:  Excuses, bullcrap, and more excuses. I had enough. I acted out of anger... that was a mistake. But I only have so much patience! It's more than most, but it's still limited.  I'll still go see the movie. I'll take the whole flippin youth group.

      I wrote a song about a week ago. It's probably one of my best, even though it's like all the rest and has NO MUSIC.

I guess I wasn't feeling it or something... I don't know. I promise the next one will be much better. PROMISE.  I was really tired today. And kinda sick. I didn't eat much at all... that's really not like me. I don't know what's the matter with me! Is it the Red Wings doing bad? Is it the Tigers doing good?   This is not good for me.   I'm fairly sure of that. I hope Katie can come to Ichthus with us. She has no youth group... I think I should get her involved withours a little more. Sure, this is easier said than done.

      Hm. Who can tick me off worse than Gator? I didn't see the actual conversation between Katie and my brother, but she said it went something like this:    Katie  : i have to go in ten minutes, can you let James on?   Gator  : no, I'm on my time I have a life too you know  It made her upset... really upset. And it made me ANGRY when I heard about it! She's leaving for Canada tomorrow morning, I'm not going to be able to talk to my precious gift from God until Saturday, and Mr. High and Mighty "I have a life too, it consists of playing games over the internet and screwing my brother out of talking with his girlfriend" can't give up ten minutes of his life for anybody. What a jerk. I'm gonna go kill him. If he was doing something important, then I'd understand. But he wasn't. Stubborn little moron. He'd rather hurt people to make a point than perform what would have been a nice gesture.  I didn't go to Bible study today. My youth group's driving me nuts for some reason and I just needed to disengage. It's not permanent by any means, and I just needed some time for myself.  What a way to start the vacation... I feel like I'm on top of the friggin world. At least the Red Wings start the playoffs Wednesday. What else do I have to look forward to this week... oh yeah, NOTHING.

I'm tired of all the mindless work, the stupid people, and the redundant, ritualistic teachers. Less than three weeks, James. Three weeks.  I'm hungry. I don't know why. I just ate.  AHHHH! I wish Katie was here. I can't see her this weekend cuz we're all going up to Gladwin and there's no room in the car.  I get to see her once a week.  If I'm lucky.  A lot of people ask: "Why do you keep doing this? If you can only see her once a week, why not just... stop? And besides, she might just be playing you. You can't see everything she does."  Do I need to? I'll give you the single reason this continues: I love her. I don't think God crossed our paths and meant for this to "just... stop."

      I'm really friggin sick of people doing one of the following:  1) Chastising me for how I act... because I don't act "normal." (SCREW THE NORM!) 2) Being bitter about little stuff that I've done. (I'm over it, you should be too. Believe me, I feel guilty a lot more than most.) 3) Excluding me because I'm not like you! (I WILL NEVER BE LIKE YOU!)  Maybe that's the problem. I think I need to lead rather than follow. Yup. So if people want to make a small, walled-up clod of friends, I'm okay with that.  I'm thinking about getting our group together and resubmitting the proposal to get our bible study on the church agenda. We have a new youth pastor (ERIC!) and it will most likely work this time. Hopefully.  I think I'm going to blow up sometime between now and June 10th. I really don't think I can stand three more weeks of school.   Stuck in my head:  nothing good...

      But I have come back to you, Blogger! Mainly because Katie's blog put mine to shame. :( I don't deserve her. Or a lot of other things. I bought a sweet hat! It's felt, and striped green and white (GO STATE) and it's like three feet tall. It's great. I wore it to Super Walmart and kept bugging Gator about how dumb his hat was. Kevin rocked last night! I didn't know he was that good! That may have been the last free show I'll get into before he's famous. He's growing up so fast! I have nothing more to say. End.   Stuck in my head:  "See the Flames Begin to Crawl" by FIF   The crowds recoil, demand our survival Fists in the air, mouths caked with saliva But you are the ones, the spark that was spawned Who picks up the pieces and passes it on!

      We went to the storage unit today, and it is looking more like a junk hole than ever. However, I did manage pick up some sweet junk to put on my wall and a couple of t-shirts that fit me when I was nine; and still do. It's sweet! The rest of the crap we're gonna throw away or sell. I think we might get through the entire shed... sometime. Not likely. There's a lot of nothing in there.  Then I went to the Sonshine concert at my church. It was really good, it sounds like they've been working hard. This year's gonna be good for Sonshine, it kinda makes me sad that I didn't try out. :( But that was God's decision, not mine. Numerous times I have to keep telling myself that. When I walked through the door of the church, I was surprised to see how many people just walked up and gave me a hug, or said, "Hey, you feeling better?" I didn't know that many people knew I was sick, or even cared. It made me feel a lot better, I'll tell you.  Afterwards, we went with the Page clan to retrieve a wooden swingset and set it up in their backyard. We were paid with Big Macs :) and it was fairly easy. I got a huge splinter though. Meh. It's just wood. Anyway, we upstairs and watched TV in Sarah's room after. I didn't know how much abuse that was going to be! I was trapped, sitting there watching Jeff Foxworthy (which, while he normally is VERY funny, he wasn't very interesting on this particular occasion unless I pretended to laugh) while Sarah and Gator sat on the bed and cuddled... kissed and stuff. You know the deal. It burned a friggin hole in my heart. Where's my Katie when I need her (probably as much as she needs me!)? It always hurts being this far away, but that piled it on EXTRA GOOD tonight. bleh.   Stuck in my head : "Simply" by Pillar  You simply love Despite all the stupid things I've done It's hard to remember That you simply love

      I promise not to be ridiculously whiny and complain like I have in the past few blogs. I am sure you are deeply grieved that I had nothing better to write about than being sick. Forgive me, for now I am almost as good as new.  I GOT MY CD YESTERDAY! :D! I preordered the new Pillar CD, "Where Do We Go From Here" at Ichthus and have been desperately awaiting its arrival. IT CAME... dum dum dum. It is so good! It's a perfect blend of their first two CD's, "Above" and "Fireproof," with a hint (nay, a smidge) of punk. Amazing. No more words.  I hope I'm 100% by the end of the week... I wanna go down to the church sometime and bother the Sonshiners. I mean, come on. They're at my church... WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. :P I'll have to go hassle them a bit.  One of the downfalls of summer is this: there is nothing even close to good on TV until 4 in the afternoon. When I have to be up at 8:00 in the morning to take a pill, I'm not planning on going back to sleep so that's a lot of stupid TV! Well, there is ESPN. But it's only baseball, and that's really boring stuff. >sigh   Stuck in my head : "Hypnotized" by Pillar  Where do we go from here How did it disappear It's hard to see with our own eyes These lies, we've been hypnotized

      Quoting Dustyn after last night's concert at our church. I was in the bathroom, lying down next to the toilet. How often DO you see that? I had to get off the stage during the closing prayer because my stomach was threatening... well, you get the point. I just changed my shirt, came home (and left my skates at the church), got on the internet for about half a minute, and went to bed. How selfish am I... that I cried (THAT NEVER HAPPENS, I SWEAR) last night because I was hurting so bad, yet failed to cry at a depiction of my Savior's betrayal and gruesome death (I told you that never happens)? That's what I did. I climbed into bed, closed my eyes, and held a stuffed animal as tight as I could (Wow. I'm definitely turning into a sap.). Of course, I struggled to get maybe two hours of sleep last night. It was definitely not my best moment.  This morning I woke up at about 6, 6:30, 7, 8 (drugs!), 8:30, 10, and finally at 11. My throat was REALLY dry and sore, and my neck hurt because I'd been sleeping on it wrong. My headache eventually went away after taking almost-almighty asprin, and I tried to eat.  I despise sickness. It's not just because it's so disempowering, but I know that this kind of sickness is not from God. You feel so... helpless. Even in this day and age, with so-called "super drugs" and the like, you know that control of YOUR situation is not in YOUR hands. Maybe that's why it can make you selfish. It's taking an awful lot for me to realize that all I have the power to do is pray and obey.

      Man, I sounded like an idiot for most of the day today. I had a mouthful of spit, and people just misunderstood every word I said. Why so much spit? I couldn't swallow it! It was actually laborous to get the guts to gulp it down. It hurt really bad. It's getting better now, but I'm not sure if it'll stay till morning. I hope it does, because I don't wanna sound like the wrestling announcer who can't swallow his saliva tomorrow at the concert. That would rock... most definitely. :D  VBS is over. Our church will look like Hawaii for two more days, then it will be gone. :( It was fun while it lasted, though. I got to help (which involved a lot of sitting around, doing nothing) and I got a shirt out of it. So it's all good. It was over so fast though! Dang. Like a friggin... lizard. I dunno.  I'm getting a little sick of Nick (whoo that rhymed!). He just comes over whenever, and goes through our fridge and eats our food. AND HE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY! I swear the kid's a machine! Gator doesn't have a problem with it, but he doesn't have Nick sleeping in his room, either. It's stupid. He' over here all the time... I'm about ready to say, "Dude. You have a home. Go eat there. Sleep there, too, while you're at it." Some people.   Stuck in my head : "Rawkfist" by Thousand Foot Krutch   Hold up your rawkfist If you're feelin it when I drop this! Oh! I just might let it go that's the sound when the rock hits... (WHUMP WHUMP) That's the sound when the ROCK HITS.... (WHUMP WHUMP) THAT'S THE SOUND WHEN THE ROCK HITS!!!

      bahhhh! I hate being sick. I'm not really "sick" as in I could stay home from school if it were still going. Does that make sense? Well, it better, because I'm not clarifying. I just have a sinus infection and a really sore throat. So I gotta take antibiotics every 8 hours (midnight, 8 in the morning, and 4 in the afternoon. gotta love my timing) and I take Actifed just because. No, actually it helps. I don't know how, but it does.   Moving on!  Nick hit a cow with his car. It's all very interesting and long, so if you get a chance, ask him about it. I AM SO GLAD THE PISTONS WON LAST NIGHT! hehe I said they would win in six games, but they managed to do it in five. Absolutely amazing. Did you know that the odds of the Pistons winning the finals was 5-1? that crazy... I thinks that's like 20%. There's nothing to do around here. I basically spend my time reading (NICOLAE!) or on the computer... it's really sad.   Stuck in my head : The Great Houdini by New Found Glory  But I'm saving myself from you  And did you notice anything  The change is me  Now it's safe to say  You will never change your ways  You would give up anything  To prove your point  There's nothing left to say  You will never change your ways   p.s.- this isn't because of Katie. I love her... this was a song that got stuck in my head after I broke up with Becky. ;)

      Ronald Reagan is dead, man. Our last good president... kicked the bucket.  AND IF JOHN KERRY WINS, HE'LL TURN OVER IN HIS FRIGGIN GRAVE!  whoo. One more week of school. One final day, then three days of sheer terror. Yay exams! I think Wednesday's gonna be the hardest because that's French IV and US History. AP US History. buhh... know everything that happened in America since 1865 and I'm set! Thursday will be real easy since I don't even have an exam in psych and Pre-Calc/Trig is simple. Bio II and English? Well, ya gotta love a good crap shoot cuz that's exactly what that is.  I slept till 2:30 today. That's really crazy... but it's probably cuz I've been a little sick. This headache sucks! Asprin is useless.  I didn't know dogs got beef flavored toothpaste. That's so cool. I'm going to have to try it.  I got paid $49 today for being a ref... that brings me up to 63. I NEED 75 or I don't go to TFC camp! ahhh I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

      I love that song! It's been stuck in my head since I got "Revenge of the O.C. Supertones" for my birthday. Which... since I haven't written in here since before July 10th, I am 16 now. Kudos to everyone who hates me for letting me get this far.   But I digress.  I did not have the kind of birthday I really wanted. Of course, you might be able to guess where I REALLY wanted to be. But Lapeer would have been nice. Or Bay City. Or Davison, even... but it had to be GLADWIN. The name of that city puts some kinda loathing of what all goes on there, and what sticks to the walls of those peoples' hearts. You could break one of their pencils and they'd remember it till the day they die! Which leads to another feeling I get about Gladwin: shame. I know that a lot of people aren't "proud" of their families, but this is a very special bunch of rednecks that never ceases to amaze me with their relentless grudge-holding. And of course there's that one thing... that happened... which I can't talk about! hey! so good luck guessing what it is.  I can't wait till Family Camp. I love the Hills. And there will be certain elements (psst! That means Katie) that will make this year so much better. :)  I went to go see David Crowder Band, Mercy Me and Michael W. last night! It was a really good show... even though the ground was pretty hard and my but kept going numb. :/ But the real treat was the ride home when Sarah fell asleep on my brother. I kinda just looked out at the rain while (>SNAP  My dog is very itchy. Scratching has become her hobby.   Stuck in my head : "We Shall Overcome" by the O.C. Supertones   Now here's what I do, I hope I get through So cling to what's true and tell the world too Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers These kids that smoke weed, these kids that drink beers Don't wanna hear what you have to say And they shut their ears and laugh cuz you pray But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God, but I was empty.   RIGHT ABOUT NOW I'D LIKE TO HEAR EVERYONE SAY YES, O YES, WE SHALL OVERCOME! MY FRIENDS GOT A JOB, ARE THEY GONNA GET IT DONE? YES, O YES, WE SHALL OVERCOME!

      I spent the last three days at camp co-counseling with Kyle! Before I get into details, I had a great time, and I'd do it again if I had the time or energy. We had a total of seven (7) Discovery campers. They were 8-9 years old... and they had lots and lots of energy. We had a kid who had "disciplinary" problems. We took him to Kim on the last day, but took him back because he was having more fun with Kim than he was with us. That always happens! Why must you feed them, Kim? THEY'RE BAD! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PUNISHMENT! Anyway, we had another kid who was high-functioning autistic and was on a gluten-free diet. He required quite a bit of attention... we almost had to call a lost camper. He just wandered off and didn't tell us, and it freaked both of us out. We eventually found him, and there was no harm done. But I was about ready for a nice, long nap.  I sincerely belive that Kyle would have been dead or close to it if he had not requested me to come help him. He was cool, though. The experience really paid off. Now if I hustle and get the money I need for TFC camp, I can go to family camp! (yay)   Stuck in my head : Some song by John Reuben, I don't know what it's called but it's NEAT! (hehe. I just said neat.)   When you rappers start rhyming Or the singers start whining Just remember to not look like you're trying

      I'm now into the fifth book of the Left Behind series: Apollyon. He's supposed to be some "Chief of the Abyss" who leads some legion of demonic... locusts? I dunno, I guess I'll find out when I read it. But Nicolae Carpathia (if you don't know who he is, he's basically the king of the world at this point in the series. READ THESE BOOKS, they own) isn't really "ruling" per se, he's just fuming about how terrible everyone is and plots to kill them. What a jerk. He's the worst king of the world ever. And he's the Antichrist. So you know, he's kind of a guy who you "love to hate." Which I do. And he's not even real! HAHA I hate that man.  What an icebreaker. Okay, now to something that MIGHT be relevant.  TFC CAMP WAS AWESOME! I had an awesome time, and I really opened myself up to let God do something in me. I can't wait to see myself (hey stupid, that doesn't make any sense!) after He's all done. It could have been truly something... but there was a cabin which I shall not name that soured the whole experience a bit. They did some things that you normally would not expect to see from Christians at a Christian camp at least. I don't know what to do! I think Dan already knows, but I would expect some kind of scolding... or even just some kind of stern word that's like, "Hey, don't do that. That's not cool." I want to tell him that all this "activity" concerned me, but I really don't wanna look like a whiner or a snitch or something like that. Whatever.   We lost again in softball. (sigh) You'd think that if the other team was down three people we could pull off a win. Sadly, no. We got beat by like 10.  Anyway, our last game is on Thursday and we're in a tourney next Saturday. >REDEMPTION!<>     I know there's more to write, but I can't think of it. Especially not at this hour... I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M A SENIOR! It feels so wierd cuz I'm used to treating everyone like I'm younger than them... which is true. But I can't get away with that when I'm a senior. Hehe. That's right, I own you. :D    Stuck in my head:  "What It's Like" by Downhere   In the wake of the last decades and centuries past   Who's to blame for this mess?   And who's gonna take the rap?   We're quick to judge and discard   A God who lets you choose whom and what to love   Isn't it always the question?   Do You really know my position?
