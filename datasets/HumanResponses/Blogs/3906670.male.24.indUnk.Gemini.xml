      Yesterday nite, I ended a relationship wif a friend I knew outside... Not I ended of course, she ended it. This friend of mine, though can be quite lame sometimes, but is quite nice and funny. But she's a bit too temperamental. She told me before that she blocked off some of her frens in msn and deleted their numbers off her handphone if she find them boring or there's nothing to talk to them. I wonder that if she does that, she might really miss those that can really be her friends instead of some that she currently has. I really scared that she fell into bad company again. She got into trouble once and went into Girl's Home. Now she's under probation. But I also pity her because now she cant even go out of her house, she can only stay in her house till this October. If I were her, I would feel super bored also. So sometimes I can understandwhy her behaviour and attitude to people are like that.   But just yesterday night, I told her on the phone that i want to brush my teeth first and then continue my conversation with her. She rejected at first, asked me to continue to chat with her. Then I chatted with her a while and asked the same question again... She rejected again. Then finally, She say "Okie" and hang up my phone suddenly. Then in my MSN, she messaged me saying "eh we dun contact ler. bb ~ =P". Believe or not, when i saw that message, it was so hurting. And like that I lost a friend whom I want to guide so that she won't go the wrong way in her life.&nbsp;I thought I would able to meet her during the October but guessed that won't be possible le...   Now I'm listening to the song "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"... Suddenly I feel like saying sorry to her if I have agitated her or wat. But I have never regreted of being her friend...  Sigh... dun wanna blog anymore now... No other words to express my feelings inside me...

      Last friday, i went off for a chalet at Aranda Club which is near the Pasir Ris Escape Theme Park. That's why i wasn't online all these days. Wonder if there's people missing me these days... haha~~ Anyway, it was fun and the place there is so nice, compared to the Costa Sands and NTUC one. The place looks like a hotel room to me, with nice beds to sleep on, air-con in everwhere you go. But only a few of us turn out in the first day. Most people came for the BBQ which is on the second day, but left in the night of the same day. So still left the pathetic number of us that night, but still.. overall is fun. Over there, we discussed about some things like the singer, Ou De Yang Ocean, coz he din reveal his real looks and we felt that his looks must be cannot make it, but voice is good. Then we also played FIR songs, with my friend playing guitar. My friend&nbsp;is pretty good in guitar and he managed to catch some of the chords for FIR songs which&nbsp;I heard that it's pretty hard because their songs modulate a lot. And also we try&nbsp;hear more Ba Gua news from each other because we have&nbsp;a long time never heard of each other's news... haha~~ That's the trend in my group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would want to stay a bit longer over there on Sunday, but too bad that I have promised a friend to watch Mean Girls on that day. And I have to rush all the way from&nbsp;Pasir Ris&nbsp;to the Boon Lay... the two extreme points of a MRT trip. &nbsp; I think I fell sick during the stay, because the air con there is so cold. No one knew how to off it till the clever me saw the switch at the ceiling. Now I got a bit of cough and flu, but think it's recovering by itself... Oh yah, talking about Mean Girls, it is very nice indeed, plus I use free tix to watch, so double nice~~ Then spend the whole day with my friends, went to play arcade games which i seldom go these days. But over there, I pick up car racing and pretty like much about it. By then I was pretty tired, so decided to go home and touch my computer which i haven't done for these days... &nbsp; But coming back home makes me think of doing my project... which is... sigh. Still have to do it though, maybe later... before I go for choir practice today, which is dancing. But maybe I can't dance because I am a bit sick... well.. see first then

      Sigh... well, another boring day has passed. Supposed to go swimming in the morning but stupid rain spoilt the day. But I can get the chance to sleep longer. Recently I have been slacking a lot... like to lie on my bed till 12 plus before i wake up, though i was already awaken.  At least I did something productive today, finally get the mood to read my project stuffs and found some new materials. Spend the whole day doing that, quite boring though, so i played my synthesizer to kill the boredom. Gish.. think i shld brush up wif my key scaling, getting worse... But I found the kick in playing Lonely Season by David Tao and of course the song itself is so nice... coz it describes most of my feelings inside me.  Talking about Lonely Season, the feeling of being lonely has been a norm to me all the while. So I might be found being anti-social by some people but please, I don't do that on purpose. I guessed that's me sometimes, likes to be alone, though i also joke and make fun with my friends around me. That's why some of my friends in Music Clinic found me quiet at times and they thought something happen to me. Especially Zhunming, though he's juz a kid, he tries to be adult-minded and questioned me on my weird behaviour recently. Haha~~ I'm glad that he is so concerned with his friends. He's really a great friend who is well-liked by all people in the choir. Anyway, I'm also sorry to make the others worry for me like tat.  There's one time when I and Zhuming talked about girls that we liked.. haha~~ Guessed most people know about the girl that Zhuming is aiming for =P. For mine, the girl whom I treated her as my gan mei mei, is attached with someone i also know of and I expected that she would be with. She said that I am very chi(1) qing(2) which i actually think that it's quite true =P. I still try my best to win her heart despite that she told me she only treat me as her god brother and that kind of self-struggle lasted for more than a year. Because I always thought she is the one that I am looking for, but well, too bad that it doesn't go as what i thought. But now I am very happy for her, considering that she had a bad experience with the previous one that hurt her feelings a lot. Though I cannot be the one to take care of her as her boyfriend, I hope that we can still treasure our relationship as close friends and god-siblings.  Maybe, getting into relationship is something that I'm not up to. Everytime i try, i fall. The more i try to get into it, the harder the impact it is to me. So sometimes i tell my friends that i will be going single forever, but actually deep inside me, I yearn to find someone whom i can take care of and love her wif all my heart. People always tell me that love will come when it suppose to come. I don't think it applies to me... haha~~. Recently I tried once though and it didn't work out for me as expected.. haha~~ In the meantime, I just keep a neutral feeling about this. Maybe scared of its consequences again.   Anyway, I'm not writing all these to win pity of the girls out there. Gosh.. I rather be single like tat.. haha~~ Just wanna write something out from my heart.

      Today has been a busy day outside. First I went to my friend's convocation ceremany for some phototaking session. Today's is ARTS faculty one, so see most of the students wear blue gown with pink strips. Heard that Computing one is ugly.. orange colour.. yucks.   After that, I went to watch Brotherhood with my friends. Quite nice though, considered that it's from Asian production, very much like Band of Brothers. Oh yah, maybe before you go watch this movie, go check up when the Hershey's chocolate started. Is it before 1950 or after 1950? Haha~~ Because some snacks pop up in the movie which narrates in the year 1950. Surprise to see Hershey's chocolate in a 1950 war movie =P. Moreover, it's the same packaging as now. Don't tell me they never change the packaging for over 50 years. And wonder why the movie is call "Brotherhood"? Me and my friends come out with this reason that in the movie, most of the time you will see the brothers "hood" each other. The word "hood" in Hokkien means beat, so tat's why it's call "Brother Hood". You may find some things amusing in the movie, but still it's quite a nice show. I wanna watch Mean Girls next time, since Trish says it's nice.   Then we went over to Bukit Timah food centre to eat my all time favourite BBQ Stingray!! Not only that, we ate carrot cake, pan fried dear meat, fried prawn noodles, Ju(2) Kuey(4)... Oh my... too much unhealthy food, so oily some more... But still it's nice, so don't care much lar.  Anyway, today my handphone went flat in the day. So I suppose some of my friends wont be able to contact me. Should have charged it yesterday. Then today I just knew a surprise news, heard that one of my friends is attached. He's from Music Clinic one.. but not from the choir, so people from choir... no need to think so much about it...  Okie, enough for now... may continue later...

      As the title has said... how I wished I don't have this final year project so that I can enjoy my holidays without much worries and extra burden. Now I am in super holiday mood, I have not seen my lecturer for more than 2 weeks... guessed she misses me... haha~~ not me lar, it's my work, so don't get the wrong idea wor. As Trish complain to me about her projects and essays, I kinda understand her situation as well, though I told her learn to bear with it for the start and she will enjoy the fruitness of the result once everything ends. I kinda of lied to her a bit.. haha~~ because sometimes when a project finishes, the end-results may not be what you are hoping for, so... cross your fingers =) Now I'm trying to consolidate the stuffs that I have read for my project, so that I could let the lecturer see I got do some stuffs (In fact, not much lar). Okie.. enough of my project talk =)

      Now it's 7pm. Just came back from tuition, finally got out from the torture hands of my students... haha~~ Today's kinda of a bad day... hot in the afternoon... den starts to rain when i am on my way to tuition. Why it cant be a fine windy day.. no hot sun or no heavy rain... Anyway.. wat's for lunch?? Yummy Johnson Duck... long time never had those. Maybe next time i go buy one whole roasted Johnson duck for my dinner... it's real nice.. especially the tasty tender meat... yumm... Now that I'm back home, i'm suppose to carry on with my project... but seems like there's no motivation in doing it. Feel like playing games again... someone can stop me from doing that?? haha~~ Please.. i need help in it.. someone to control me from playing those games. Oh... 91% already... 9% more to finish download the episode 122 of Prince of Tennis. Just came out this morning, so I left my computer on to download till I come back home. It's a very nice anime about tennis, so maybe those who like to play tennis could try watching it. Ok I shall stop here.. will continue later if I could...   (2 hours later...) I spent some time doing some modifications to my blog and here it is!! Added a midi song so that when you browse my blog, you can get to listen the wonderful music... now playing is "Nothing's gonna change my love for you" by George Benson. And also I add links to other people's blog like Tricia's. Don't know if others got blog or not, so that I can link to theirs also.. Hehe~~ Okie.. now finished these, I go and watch my anime now... just finished downloaded the stuff... BRB...   (Several hours have passed...) Well, as expected, I haven't even start reading my project stuffs and guessed what i have been doing? Playing gunbound... haiz... It has become too addictive for me. Must find a way to kick this habit.. if not, my lecturer will come after me for my work... how? how? Someone must stop me leh~~ Okie.. now i try to do some reading for my project...so I log off a while...

      Now it's 2.35am... still idling around in the late night.. doing nothing much. Now i'm watching a very old TV show... remember it's a channel 8 serial show during my primary school times. The song for this show is written by Lee Weisong also. Very old show le... haha~~ Actually I going to sleep soon, going to school in the morning to print some stuffs coz it's cheaper over there. But just dunno why still dun wanna sleep. Yesterday I did nothing much. Laze at home, waiting for time to go to Music Clinic for choir practice. Raining some more... good time for lazing... And the practice is on diction. There's a difference between diction and dictation... anyway it's not important. As usual, my chinese diction is not good... but i'm glad that i can still remember some chinese words which some dunno... to think that i lost touch in chinese for dunno how many years...haha~~ OK.. time to sleep le... bui bui~~

      As of my title... today's actually is another fine day for me... but someone twist it for me... and i suspect some of you all know who tat person is...  Today's should be a nice day... learn dancing mah... Then during in the middle of the practice... she came to me and said, "You did it again..." I said I did what. She said that I started to order the other choir members around. I said, "When did I order the people around??" She said, "Never mind, later I tell you..." From there, my mood start to drop... I kept thinking when did i order the people around. I just merely asked the choir member to gather, to listen when our dance teacher is talking. Nothing's wrong right?? Guys (from choir of course)... if you really think that I did order you people around... please tell me... I truely don't know if I had did that. Did I ever use a harsh tone to talk to people?? No.. Did I say "You better do this.. You better do that!!"?? No... I wonder if she is too sensitive already. Anyway, after that, I didn't bother to look for her to clarify the matter.. because I too sianz to talk to her... I even asked my dance teacher if I am harsh to my choir member or did I order them around. She said no ar. She said all I do is to gather the people around and to listen to her talking. That's all lor. I even asked some of my fellow choir members. They even said no lor. I guessed she's too sensitive le. Anyway, someone told me that there's one time that I did order my choir member around. And I admit that is true. For that, I got nothing to say... because I really did that mah, for the reason that I hope that all of us will have our best performance and maybe I was too eager to do so and didn't reallise myself for being demanding. For that, I'm truely sorry to my choir friends. And because of that, there's a period of time where I am quite quiet, didn't talk much to other people. Hiaz.. I dunno how to react in front of her... seeing her makes me sianz, makes me think that she got something against me.
