      Friday night was "Lock In" at the middle school.  A twelve-hour event, "Lock In" is basically a crazed, mass sleep over at school.  There was an obstacle course, faux jousting, a dance party, two movie rooms, a video game room, billiards, ping pong, an open gym, a slam dunk contest, and a soccer tournament.  About 60 students attended.    I worked the 12 to 4 am shift and ran the soccer tournament.  When I played, I got massively kicked in the ankle.   The students mingled and wandered. Some sat.  Some stayed at an event for much of the time.  The ping pong attracted one crowd; the dance held quite another.  Some of them kids were manic, revving with adrenaline and carbonation.  Others were laconic, glum with freedom not to sleep but unsure of what to do with their new power.   In one collection of couches, a group of ladies found glee with tweezers. A young man, who had hit the jackpot of female attention--in that sad way that some young men would prefer borderline abuse to the emptiness of disregard--offered up his eyebrows to their soft hands.  Tweezing as a proxy for . . . .   Not a bad gig.

      We haven't been at it too long, but it does seem that the kid goes to sleep at 7:30/8, or not at all.  It's now 10, and he's wild-eyed.   We've tried overfeeding, rocking, singing, and, soon, the nightime drive on the freeway.  We shall see . . .

      The tutors at Gunston Middle School, provided through a program called "Gear Up", generally follow groups of students from course to course and respond to academic needs.  First semester, I worked with Jimmy C., who was outstanding.  From New York, Jimmy C. provided a vivid example of how to grow up if you're poor, Latino, and from the rough part of town.  The students looked up to him and craved his tutoring.   This semester, David is my room's tutor, and he's completely incompetent.  Through his tutelage, my students have completed assignments incorrectly. They miss the points of lessons, more so than if they had just remained in class.  When his small tutoring groups are assigned a story to read, he makes fun of the story, mispronounces words, and misses the point, the theme, the message entirely.  And he doesn't care.  He's a raging detriment.  I have to correct his behavior as often as I do the adolescents. He plays with his cellphone in class, checks his e-mail, and chats with students during lectures.  He throws paper at students, gets into wrestling matches in the hallway, and offers easy distractions.    He might even be a perv.  He goes out of his way to chat with the pretty, popular girls of the 8th grade.  He does not have the same attentive manner with the less attractive, gawky students.   HE NEEDS TO GO.
