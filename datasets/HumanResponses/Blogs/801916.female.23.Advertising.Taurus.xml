      the only thing i think i hate worse than moving every year is finalizing your class schedule. man. this is def an intricatly detailed form of art that, even tho i am a senior, i have yet to master. i just found this class - engl 361 - the literature and culture of youth in 20th century britain. (OMG what an awesome booklist u have NO idea: a clockwork orange, trainspotting, you name it - i wanna read it) but it conflicts with other classes ive got. so i should drop one, but then if i do that then i only have one advertising class this semester which is fucked up cuz thats my major - not engl (in which i would have 3 classes). oh boy. im still trying to maintain my no classes on friday schedule. so far its lookin good. only prob now is that 361 is closed - eeek! when did that happen?? it was open last week....=( hmmm must go to class at 1230 and check it out tho - its a new prof ive never heard of b4 - and ive taken a lot of engl classes here - i bet hes probly young, considerin the topic, i hope he doesnt suck tho.  ~~side note~~ kurt called me yesterday (small yay) i miss the kid. i left my cell in my car tho so i didnt get the message till today. ill be givin him a call soon - i cant believe hes at eastern - only like 45 mins away!!! awesome =) for those of u who dont kno kurt, we dated in high school - ive known the kid for yrs tho - he went to my church and stuff too - yeah yeah yeah i kno its cute - cool thing is, that even after a big mess in high school we remain friends. im really glad abt that. hes an awesome person. id really miss him if he ever went completely out of my life.   ok now off to the 361 class to check it out. and its only upstairs! =)  i love how the freshmen havent discovered the computer labs other than the union yet - its great! =)

      ok so i havent written on here in QUITE a while.....today is the first day of classes (yuck) and ive only had one so far - it looks pretty cool tho - the teacher is my counsler and shes pretty funny - it doesnt look too hard and it seems pretty interesting - ADV 394 - persuasive response - if any of u are interested in takin it if u can (go comm majors!!) anyway, bringin ya up to date: life is pretty dang good. i am happy with my life and the ppl in it. my roomies are lookin dandy, i have a new boy in my life who keeps makin me like him more every time im with him (which is pretty freakin cool lemme tell ya), im realizing who is going to remain my friend forthe rest of my life and who is cool to hang with for now - this is a lil important cuz i just chilled on the quad for a bit with paul (whos mom btw SUGGESTED that we live together - go mrs. tongyoo!!) and i kno that wherever i go in life ill always be able to count on him and that he'll always be there for me - thats an incredibly secure and safe feeling that i am loving.  and the best thing is, is that i kno that hes not the only one. i can name a few people that i am completely sure will never be apart from me (emotionally - not physically cuz u cant take your friends everywhere u wanna go - but if u could that would be hella cool - imagine takin business trips to japan with friends - hell yeah!!) anyway, back to why i am so glad to be here. its funny, this is my last yr at u of i and admittedly i am glad to leave (no one misses the south farms - ick) but i am more sad than i thought i was gonna be. many ppl and things fall into this catagory of makin me just more than a lil blue abt leavin here. most recently rob was added to this list. he keeps sayin that we have this yr - which is totally cool and im def up for - and at the same time it makes me sad cuz all we have is this yr. then again im getting ahead of myself here - we could break up like tomorrow or anytime after that. and while i kno this is true and im as ready for that as one can be, i kno that ill always remember the time ive been with him - hes really a cool kid (plus hes got my name - who can beat that?)  anyway, must go. rhet starts at 2 and its onthe third floor. all this walking!! i sure didnt miss that this summer. ill write more when i get a chance. c-ya kidz!

      ok so today was incredibly hectic - give it to the last remaining days of work for it finally to get interesting =Þ anyway, since i didnt *confirm* with a friend of my dads to get together tonite he made other plans (ouch) - nuthin like bein brushed off by a 40 yr old man to make ya feel insignificant. i wonder what his other plans are....maybe he doesnt have any and just wants to  seem  like he does....yeah thats it (saving my ego a lil here) so yeah, til i kno who reads this i dont really wanna post some stuff - mainly if i write sumthin bad abt ya and u read it here and then go torch my car - ive got noone to blame but myself. i do think we'll use made up names if it comes to that - i dunno - havent really decided. or maybe ill just not write negative stuff abt ppl - that works too.    speakin of: school is lookin waay up. i got to see many faces ive missed this summer on mon and tues - esp my good friend tim who im secretly gonna marry (well, after his perfect gf somehow disappears *wink*) ive missed him a lot more than i thought - hes completely awesome to talk to (and the change in look is a plus - verrry nice timmy - it suits him  real   well) and hopefully sometime this yr we'll get around to those guitar lessons we've been talkin abt since frosh yr (he plays amazingly well - i dont) ileana is back - after a horrendous scare of her not returning to school (bad illie) but we're all happy campers again in the apartment of death  eric, rob, and ethan all live less than half a block away - who knew?! and dereks place is pretty close - very nice. jenna lives across the street, and yeti's gonna live in my parking spot! ok, so the last ones a lie, but thats a crazy amount of friends to all live w/in 500 ft of me dontcha think?  ive paid off my credit cards (correction: my mom did and now i get to pay her for the rest of my existence) - at least this way im not creating more debt with damn finance charges and what not. gotta love mommy! =) note: i had to sign a contract telling her the payments that im gonna make, on what dates, and how much each will be - my moms not like yours "sure honey pay me when u can.." nope. mine straps you to a chair and makes you sign ur life away b4 u get up. shes been doin it since i can remember. how many of u had to sign and date a piece of paper sayin when your room was to be cleaned by? thats right. none. cept me and my bro - well even not that - technically me. i used to say that she was a tyrant, now i just think she did whatever the hell she could to get me to cooperate - i was quite the kid ill tell ya that. talked my way outta a lot of stuff - only way to get me to stick to sumthin was to make me sign it i guess - tho dont think that stopped me - i remember signing funny and then telling her later that i didnt have to abide by the contract cuz i think she forged my signature cuz it doesnt look like mine. after that episode she paid careful attention to how i signed. just be thankful that none of u had me as your child - i dunno how my mom got thru it some days....but hey - now im a well-adjusted, likable, 21-yr old who has her whole life looming in front of her. looming is a great word for that. its totally how i feel. the more i wanna get away from IL and the whole mid-western area, the more things (mainly ppl) tend to pop up that make me wanna stay. these few kno who they are, and if i do go away u will be greatly missed (as well as emailed a whole bunch) =)   cool thing tho: if i get into grad school at u of i, stayin is lookin a whole lot better =) new ppl to hang with, a new roomie possibly (tim, the more i think abt it the more i think itd be hella fun - hey and id quit smokin for ya, thats a plus on all accounts) and some old friends id never have to say goodbye to (paul and ruthie fall into this category in a major way - dont worry, so do u em!!) at least until the next yr when i go to portfolio school....=(  oh i think i got another job too - so now ill have two jobs again at school - one at FAR and the other at the DI - ill be workin in the ad production dept designing ads and layouts and other stuff - it pays next to nothing but at least it gives me some real design experience besides my just messin around with stuff. we'll see how that goes considerin the last job i had at the DI (*shudder*) but this is a diff dept so diff experience, right? right.   i think im abt to head out - too much workin for today. check u kidz lata

      if i coulda built an ark today b4 headin to work i woulda gotten here faster - ok, maybe not an arc, but at least a canoe or boat of some kind. the streets were all flooded and the expressway was closed (yikes!) it took me an hour and a half to get here - ugh.  but bright side: tomorrow is my last day (does little happy last-day-of-work dance) - i slept for 13 hrs last night (insane!!) i got back from work hella late, ate dinner, and went to bed. abt 5 ppl called me and i never woke up - that ususally never happens, i tend to wake when my cell rings - so now i get to apologize to yeti and ru cuz i woulda loved to see u kidz, i was just in a slight coma and wasnt able to =(  i have internet again (obviously) and thank god - all i had yesterday was telnet - and u think u check ur email a lot - count how many times u check it when thats ALL u can do cuz u have no work or anything - its scary....   well im off to lunch - if i can think of any more pointless dribble i will post again  lata

      last day at school - and this is the FIRST time ive touched a computer - i swear im goin thru withdrawl. im abt to head up back to chicago to work for a bit, but i might just work wed and fri and end up coming back down for thurs - BUT thats a hell of a lot of driving so i might just tell my boss that i cant - sux but true. i hate this mandatory shit. anyway, after the apartment horrors which i will go into detail at a later time, so far school is def looking up for the year =) many reasons....will have details later if i feel like it now i gotta get some food b4 i fall over from hunger!!

      why is it in this day and age (yeah im realizing that im sounding old here) that when we need something done, a phone call doesnt suffice? all i want is this box that weighs as much as 3 elephants to be taken down to regulatory cuz if i try and move it again i think im gonna break sumthin. but does the phone call work? no. i need to send her a freakin email. why u ask? i dont kno why either. all i can think of is that there needs to be a paper trail in case we get audited and they want to kno who needed which boxes moved from the 4th to the 3rd floor.   ok first rule of work etiquette: make friends with the mail guys. eurie just took the box - no email required, no paperwork needed, simply took it cuz i asked - GO EURIE!!  gotta luv those mail guys.

      ok so i thought that today i wouldnt be able to post anything cuz theyre supposed to take away internet access on the 15th for sites not "work-related" - but hey, either im lucky, or they consider all the places i go everyday (bank, hotmail, creditcard, etc) to be work-related - either way im gold. plus today is the last day of work (sort of). i go down to school tonite and just hope to god that ileana will be there on fri mornin with her money - i havent talked to her in waaay too long to just leave it up to chance (teeny bit scared here) i gotta be in my apt tomorrow cuz theyre delievering my desk and everything - oi. i have a feeling that today is gonna go majorly slow - i have no work as usual, and actually no meetings today (thats a shocker) and only one pump request to do cuz i dunno how to do the med-ex ones.....fun fun fun - lunch with mom today too - hopefully that will go smoothly, but who am i kidding?

      another change in template - cant seem to make up my mind - this is not new - applies to a lot of things in my life - esp when the thing i cant decide on isnt good for me, but i want it *shudder* thats when things get rationalized and it just ends up ugly (ira we both kno all abt this) but on to new things - school starts on the 28th and i am  SO  ready to go back - this summer was a lil too much bonding in the family category for me. my mother was all into it cuz its my last summer home and all that jazz - honestly, it was nice, but wow was i bored. also she was so quick to tell me that this is the first summer in 3 yrs that i havent had a boyfriend while at home - she thinks this is awesome - i thought it was kinda cool but mostly boring. as chris, my friend in the navy, always says when he *finally* comes home (hint hint there chris): "so. nuthins changed much. same ole skokie." maybe thats why i had been looking for relationships in other states this yr - that was weird - hell of a lot of drivin basically.  this yrs lookin up tho - its my last (scary yet niiice) and new ppl are def welcome - if we could just get our friends to stop confessing their love, eh rups? i kno u love me, but yeti will just have to satisfy you for now - we can go on another "wakeboarding" trip later ;-)

      ok so today just started and i already have a headache - sux. pam's not at work yet so i have no work to do (hence this posting at 945am) it was kae's bday on the 12th and i forgot - oops. it was in my calendar and everything. cant believe i forgot. well she isnt really in my life anymore, but itd be cool if she was again. i miss her. not as much as i used to, but i still miss her. imagine having a bf for 6 yrs (we met orientation day of high school and never really parted) and then her finding the person she wants to marry, which is cool, but then she disappears with him never to be heard by any of us again. itd take a lot of time to try and rebuild what we once had. recently i found out it might be worth it too - she still wants me in her wedding (pink dress and all) so i think theres still hope. not so sure as i once was tho - words a friend once said: trust is so easily destroyed and painstakingly rebuilt. very true.

      ooh i must explain the title - it is taken from an ad i saw once, pretty appropriately stated if u ask me, concerning the advertising industry - where i am destined to spend many years manipulating minds.  advertising = mass manipulation.  and the ppl who work in the industry are doing precisly that: pimpin' for the Man.

      last night celebrated cyd's 21st....it was fun....i remember enuf. thats all im sayin abt that one.   today my english teacher was awesome - it so freakin hot on the third floor so he said anyone could motion to end class anytime after 20 mins of class was done. if 2/3 of the class votes yes, we end class - no question. so guess what happened at min 21 hehe....i luv that guy tho - totally awesome.  a lil waste tho for lauryn this mornin - i was runnin hella late and she gave my ass a ride to class (very cool of her) then i saw cyd and ruth outside the engl bldg - where of course i yelled "cant talk! sooooo late!!" and ran inside hearing their knowing laughter behind me. you cant impress or fool friends youve known for years - they kno u too well. to others it mightve looked like my lateness was a chance thing, but these two kno me, so they kno better.  not much to report. life is getting hella busy. AMA, AAF, DXP, PBL, and MCA meetings all this week. not to mention lacrosse practice starts next week. robs cute - said hed come watch me. dont think he knows i hate that tho. never really liked it when ppl came to watch my games and i knew. if at the end i saw them and they had been there, cool, but knowing that certain ppl were gonna be there (ie mom or bf) i get stoopidly nervous and shit.   betas still alive - been rethinkin callin him lucky - i think that might be pushin my luck. (ignore that pun)  im now secretary of my sorority. im wondering if im takin on a bit much this semester. i have to pull really good grades, im involved in a hella lot, and joined a sport, and have to study for the GRE. if i start to think abt it i think i might get an ulcer. ugh. might have to cut out a few things. what sux is that the sorority cant be cut out. PBL, MCA, AMA, and UC hip-hop might be seein less of me this semester. thats one thing i think really sux abt life: sometimes theres just not enuf time in the day to do all that you want to. but to be honest, this is lookin like a great semester and im happier than ive been in quite awhile. as cyd said last night: "it feels fuckin GOOD to be alive."

      omg - i cant believe i didnt post this:   joey died.   last night at abt 12am.  for those of you who didnt get to kno joey in the brief time that she was with us, she was my beta fish that i bought yesterday from petsmart. bought at around 5pm, died at abt 12am. short time u say? yes, unfortunately that is true. but the bright side is that petsmart guarrantees their fish for 14 days - so its all good. but no beta could ever replace joey - cept joey II perhaps? we shall see...

      alright - so class schedule is finally completed. oi. that hurt a bit. so we got adv 934 (class abt persuasion and propaganda - how to interpret and decipher propaganda and be able to use it to your advantage without getting taken over by it -  this class was made for my friend brian), adv 312 (adv history - kinda interesting, we go from 1920s to now - pretty much an easier class), engl 365 (comedy in plays - AWESOME teacher - kaufmann kicks major ass in my book - he's hilarious!), and rhet 204 (intermediate narrative writing - we'll see how i do in this class considering i didnt take beginning narrative writing and i dont have a lot of experience in the subject, but i think ill fare well). i go from 930-3 on mon and wed with a 3 hr break so i can do things such as post on this till my internet at home gets workin (shady SBC ppl), and from 11-2 straight on tues and thurs - with no class on fridays (huge plus ppl) - and thats this semester. fun fun - actually im pretty happy with it - i like all my classes and i dont go late on any day (grrr to late classes)  ok so today was interesting. woke up at 8, didnt get outta bed till 9 (thanx rob) no i really shouldnt blame him i kno, but its easier than sayin i just didnt wanna leave =)  today is the last day to return bks at TIS - damn TIS ppl. dont u kno that we dont sort out classes till 2 wks into the semester?! yeah. so i gotta return my 291 and 391 books but i dont remember which ones they were. dont u hate that? u buy all these bks at once, costing u your right leg and half your upper body, and then when u want to return them they ask for blood plus a bit of your other leg. do that enuf times and you wont be able to  crawl   away from the bookstore.   so im supposed to be writing my rhet response paper at the moment. obviously not happening. its on the second week of school and im already slacking. whats wrong with this picture?

      so i found out yesterday nite that no one is gonna be home for thanksgiving at my house.  my brother is goin to canada to see his gf, my mom is going to atlanta to see her best friend, and ill be at home all alone - shaaaadIE!!! so yeah im not even sure if im gonna go home then. i dunno. rob invited me to go to thanksgiving dinner with his family - oh boy. ive never done the significant other's family thing.  well, not as an introductary thing anyway. ive done bday parties and easy things like that - ill admit im a little scared of it.  it was real sweet of him to ask me tho.  perhaps ill bring him up to chicago so mom can meet him b4 she leaves - shes already a little miffed that dad got to meet him first.  kinda funny.  i dunno. i have dinner with his dad next thurs - we'll see how that goes.  ira thinks we're "sooo cute" - actually pretty much everyone thinks that we're really cute - it is an overly used word in our presence.  i think that its cuz a lot of ppl knew us separately and now we're dating so its cute - i guess. also i think its cuz of rob - hes so tall (6'6) and acts sheepish sometimes - hella cute.  esp when he gets that look of "i love you and i think youre wonderful" on his face like last nite. hahah soo cute - he was just so happy. ok, now im digressing. gotta write this paper for my 2pm class - but have to volunteer for the taffy apple sale b4 then - ugh. must go. BUT late lunch/early dinner with ben today - havent seen that kid in ages - thatll be nice.  man im hungry...wheres paul at?

      sometimes i wonder how some ppl make it thru the day.  it seems to take so much out of them.  and yet at other times i find myself being one of those ppl - wondering how its so easy for everyone else. funny thing: ranjit told me that i was the only non-depressed friend he has.  i was flattered (and a little worried abt him) but im not sure if that is true.

      ok just took the 312 test - not bad, not bad.  I think i pulled an A, which will help me insanely cuz i have a 2% for quizzes out of the 30% that quizzes are my final grade - basically i NEEDED to do supremely well on this exam - as well as the final. i cant believe i let those quizzes fuck me up like that - i bet a get a goddang B in the class just cuz of them. damn quizzes.  now i have to write my paper for 365 (which includes me reading the entire three plays in order to do - im not sure this is gonna happen), and i have to do the extra credit paper for 365 that i've been meaning to do forever, and i have to hand in the 394 paper that was due last friday that i ALREADY got an extension on and that will probly lower my grade a whole lot.  dang. i just cant seem to hand in shit on time this semester.  i do fine on tests but i keep handing in papers late - no goddang motivation. suckage.  its my moms 54th bday today. go mom.  cool thing: i got into the engl 300 class i need to graduate (thank god), but the cool thing was is that its taught by this prof that i had my freshman yr for 116 and he goddang remembered me! weird as all hell. i had that class second semester that yr and i havent seen him since (thats abt three yrs) - why the hell he remembered me? i have no clue.  but i think its a good thing.  he was a pretty cool teacher.  my schedules pretty much down for next semester - adv 311 (classic campaigns), adv 310 (consumers and the public - i might drop this), comm 221 (american gangster films - ooooh yeah), engl 260 (afro-american literature), and enlg 300 ((dis-)integration of american minorities in american writing).  im pretty happy - only sucky thing is that i have class every day of the goddang week.    ok now i must get back to home to eat and hopefully get one of those many essays done by 4pm on friday - arrrggg!!!

      ok. since i was yelled at for not updating this thingamabob im gonna do a short update in the little time i have: school is weird, im coasting, i shouldnt be, but i am - i havent handed in anything on time yet i dont think and i still will have at least all Bs for the semester. i miss home. i havent been back there yet and to be honestly i think that this is the longest that ive been away (not incl summer).  beta is still alive and kicking (which is pretty amazing considering how many times ive forgotten to feed him on time). my senior pics came in - oh those were hilarious.  if youre buying a yrbk just flip past me quickly, with your eyes closed, and all will be right in the world. i dyed my hair black (and yes, naturally my hair is black but its been like 4 diff shades of brown/red/shitty-looking lately) and i have magenta highlights in the front - i like it a lot =)  um i have lots and lots of shit to do cuz i was hella sick at the beginning of this week. puked in the union - the high point. i have no money. im soooo broke. its scary. so feel free to donate to the GMTNR Fund (thats the Give Money to Needy Robyn Fund).  I will be accepting donations till i die.  So if you dont have the money now, you will at somepoint, and then you can give it to me - see how that works? dandy.  i must go - my disaster-area of a room needs to be cleaned up and many other very important things need to be accomplished today.  lets see if i get to more than 2 shall we?

      does anyone else have trouble sleeping or is it just me?  i used to sleep like the dead when i came home, but this time its just not happening. i lay awake and think.  i resorted to reading till i pass out, but sometimes that doesnt work when the book youre reading turns out to be hella good (if u havent read Angela's Ashes go do it now - great book). and a few nights i soooo just wanted to take some tylenol pm, but does my mom keep anything good like that in our house? nah all we had was regular tylenol.  im so tired lately but i cant sleep. it sux. my brain is going miles a minute while i lie there in complete stillness.  then i shove the pillow into my head and cover my face with the blanket in hopes that pretending im in a cacoon will somehow force me to drown out the thoughts in my head and just sleep.  u might think this works....it doesnt.    i think im gonna start running again.  i kno thatll help me sleep.  but try to convince your paranoid mother that running at night isnt a weird cult thing like the phat pants u wear sometimes that shes so sure someone else influenced u to wear.  cuz u cant do anything on your own mind u. no no. your the good kid.  the smart kid.  the pure kid.  not like those other kidz.  your smoking, yeah that was the cause of an ex-boyfriend.  the drug use a few years ago?  yeah that was cuz of the people you were hanging out with: bad crowd; wore the big pants and did the drugs, influenced your baby into becoming like them, frightened you are for her.  and now that shes legally able to drink, shes an alcoholic if she goes out one night a week on a regular basis - ONE night - and man, its not even that regular...ok well that just caused some stress to reveal itself. interesting. perhaps the reason i cant sleep is cuz im sleeping right above all of this stress - literally.  hmmm more things to chew on.  perhaps while i go running.  tho the great thing abt running is sometimes u dont have to think - your mind clears and all you feel is the solid pavement beneath your feet and the rhythmic sound of your breathing.  you fall into a motion that your body knows so well that your mind lets it take over.  you feel the wind on your neck and your muscles stretch and burn. the pain becomes numbing as you continue on, propelled by something you cant quite understand and dont want to, because if you do youll stop and then itll be over.  ok yeah, now i really wanna go running.  too bad im stuck in this 10x6 cubicle in the middle of nowhere, oh wait - this place is called work right?

      this weekend both kicked ass and sucked ass.  went to a pretty sweet party on sat and broke up with my boyfriend on sun.  so yeah.  i feel pretty....blah.  hung out with debs, ira and kae on sunday - reunion of the four forces - was pretty cool - we're all a lil diff now tho, so its not quite the same, but the same dynamic is there and it was hella fun to chill with them.  not sure what im gonna do on NYE now - was gonna go to 608 party down at school, but now im not so sure i wanna see rob - thought i did, now not so sure - he had wanted to talk, but theres not really much else to say is there? yeah i dont think so either. my friend sean told me abt this thing his friend is throwing in indy - im considering going to that, but i dunno - i dunno if i really belong there/want to be there.  *sigh*  well, i kno that ill miss the kid, but as ira said "in the end, its best" - i just hope ill come away from this stage in my life feeling that and not regret.  *shrug*  we'll see.

      so today was my first day at work (i obviously passed that drug test thing - go me =)  and honestly i was about to slam my head against one of my cubicle walls and just end it all: straight data entry for 8 hrs with no music and no internet.  kill me.  my mind was going haywire.  i starting singing songs in my head that were all of a sudden coming out of my mouth at an alarming loud volume.  i need some music - gonna go more insane tomorrow and the next week.  cool thing: the lady who im currently doing a project for has the strongest russian accent and we did a little chatting in russian when she was explaining the project to me - verrry cute - reminds me of my bestf's mom a ton.  speaking of ira, i was hella pimped out today too - and it stuck out all the more cuz it was a CASUAL WORK DAY today - i never got the memo.  i was also over an hour early and had to wait outside in my car till 8am hit (thanx mom and kate for telling me to give it an hour and a half - hour and a half my arse) - props to stanish tho for amusing me / relieving the boredom of post-dawn in that wee hour - go bri.  now abt to go see a movie with my paulie (big awwws to this)  but its NOT a date - have to set that straight (he insists).  even tho he IS picking me up, AND paying for me, AND.....hahah no way - j/k with that one - he's all yours lizzo =)  i best go - toodles.

      back at home...already bored...when did i get here? oh yeah, yesterday.    spent time with ira the past two days - thats nice i havent seen her in ages and its good to feel that the bond is still in place =)  and i found a job - workin for walgreens at the corporate headquarters in bannackburn, il - which is up by half day road - yeah, all the fuck up by half day rd - for those who dont kno where that is its abt a lil over an hr north of my house - hell of a communte ill have - anyway, had to take a drug test for it and my fingers are crossed that i pass - not cuz im bad mind u, but cuz i hang with bad ppl (well not neccessarily bad, but not exactly law abiding) so we'll see how much "contact pot" ive accumulated in my system over this past semester - enuf to flunk a drug test? lets hope not.  so i seem to be going to my dads tomorrow at 3 - i say seem cuz no one directly told me about this visit, but apparantly i *supposedly* knew abt it and had said i was going. i think they lie. i dont remember any such conversation.  and if said conversation was had during finals, or the previous week, then i say it simply did not occur.  any conversations or events that happen during those weeks are null and void in my book.  i attest to nothing of the sort and frankly do not believe any such conversation happened. there. ive said my piece. i bet i end up going anyway.  i kno u were thinkin that too.  my friend gets off of work at 4 - i told him to go ahead and gime a call when he gets home, but i think i might be passed out by that time.    i still have yet to take the GRE and i have to do it soon.  hella soon.  and i have yet to fill out my apps to grad school which i also have to do hella soon.  what sucks is that as bored as i am here, i cant get things done.  i am incapable to do work in the chicagoland area.  anywhere.  it sux.  all i really want is to be back at school, but with no responsibilities cept work every now and again and some casual reading - thats something i do do here tho - casual reading.  with no tv to fall asleep to, ive begun to read again and honestly its nice - i do miss that - i dont do it at school enuf, or the reading that does get accomplished at night isnt as interesting by any means.  i miss certain ppl.  i wish they would email or at least call.  others i wish would stop calling.  yet others i wish i was close to again.  and then there are others whom i got close to again only to realize that i no longer want that.  we live in confusing times.  im feeling old.  like i should know what im going to do with the rest of my life, seeing as its coming in 5 months....but i have no clue.  im scared.  i thought i was past this.  i hate going home.  it brings thoughts like these into my head.

I got to see some ppl i havent seen in awhile, made xmas and new years plans, played with Cleo (who is the sweetest dog on the planet) and generally just got to hang out and take it easy.  it was a great way to end the semester.  and now, with a slight headache, im gonna pack and get my shit outta here - anyone else bet i dont leave till like 7? yeah i think so too.

      so finals are over - i survived.  thats abt all i have to say abt that.  grades are posted on the 2nd of jan - check in to see how im doing then.    mostly ppl are gone, but the few of us who remain are gathering at pete's for a celebratory keg and then out to tierney's for some good ass music - if youre still here call my cell and come along.  i still dont have a job back home yet - ill probly be buying my books in installments - do they allow that? they hella should - cuz then when u dont make a payment and they seize the book, youve already used it for tht part of your class and ya never look at it again anyway...yeah they should def consider installment payment for books.    im tired as hell and not sure why - cept i think its cuz of that one day where i had to stay up till 10am for work - yeah im sure many of you remember the "omg im still awake and consequently going insane" phone calls at odd hours of the early morning - sorry abt that btw - i had to stay awake some how - and thanx to those who suffered with me - u get a check plus on my list.  now im headin out - gonna drown some post-final sorrows in some alcohol and take my time getting back to the city - everything thats there will still be there tomorrow so dont be pissed that im not back today (u kno who u are - ill see u on mon instead - its one day - youll live.)  check u ppl later.

      alright. so its been awhile since i posted anything - sorry to those who have complained yet again.  good news: i survived that hell week of writing papers pretty well, and bad news: now its the weekend b4 finals. all the merriment in the air, the yultide joy, etc, another xmas reference, etc along with all the cramming, coffee binges, stress, etc is present at the moment.  i just want it to be over, and on Wed it will be.  one point to stress: ALWAYS find out when your finals are BEFORE the weekend b4 finals so you can avoid the feelings of "HOLY SHIT" when u realize (as i did last night) that one of your finals is on mon at 8am, not wed at 430pm - which needless to say is a bit important to know.  this revelation led to another night of alcohol last night - go tierney for the kick ass idea of chasing a shot with another shot - what the hell was that stuff anyway if anyone knows - i liked it a lot - anyway, i believe that my tolerance is getting higher, which i could believe seeing as ive gone out a helluvalot this past month - but i kno that im still slackin (shut up em - youre like 3 yrs older than me!! - thats not an excuse and yet it is - figure that out)  ok todays rambling is hardly making sense to me either right now - well i DID just get up not too long ago so i believe im granted at least that much.  ben is having Thanksmas dinner tonite - on account of al the turkeys bein on sale doug bought one and we're havin what i believe is becoming a tradition in their house - sounds exciting? we shall see. im just thankful that im gettin a decent dinner at no/minimal cost (i have to bring dessert)  had some friends visit from purdue for frequency on thurs - the verdict is  urlLink in  on that night.  ok that looks like a big enuf chunk to satisfy u ppl - g/l with finals - and congrats to the december grads - u will def be missed =)

      oh boy. so break was nice, but exhausting and weird.  it gave me a lot to think about so i think im gonna be chewing on those events for some time.  as for the rest, school is almost over - we have two more weeks of classes including this week, and then finals week.  ira will be home the week of finals so hopefully she'll be able to come down here and meet some of u folks.  i slacked off during break instead of gettin my shit done, tho i did read all three of the plays for that paper that was due last thurs which is now due tomorrow for me - i have a lot to get done this week: please ask whatever higher being you believe in to help me out - even tho i kno i probly dont deserve it.  hopefully ill get through this and my grades wont suffer too badly.  i luv u all - remember that i care and give yourself a hug from me. *hug*

      interesting.....and a bit ironic.....    -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy places. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     u can all thank  urlLink natalie , along with me, for wasting some of your time....

      To my friend:  When you are sad, ...I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the bastard who made you sad.   When you smile, ...I'll know you finally got some. When you are confused, ...I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.  When you fall, ...I will try to keep from laughing.  ok so i didnt  exactly  do the last one today....im sorry amy, but it was just  too  funny! =)

      so weekend review. lots happened and lots to think abt, so here are some thoughts in no particular order:  1. why is it that the best conversations always happen with philosophy majors? 2. sometimes things happen that make you feel incredibly lucky 3. and sometimes things happen that make you feel incredibly shitty  4. i wonder how some ppl function - are they robots, basically reacting to things that happen to them? or do they actually have evolved minds where they contemplate things and ideas and conjure up realizations and conclusions of their own? it seems like the majority of people are the former rather than the latter. 5. people do not listen to the outgoing message on answering machines - they proceed to leave a message on your machine for someone who doesnt live there even after the message states that only melissa, ileana, and robyn live at the number you dialed - and these are the kidz who go to college 6. if you dont call ppl back when they say its impt they get awful mad at you - even if you were tired as hell and sleeping when they called. 7. sometimes hanging with old friends is the best medicine. 8. if you say youre gonna call someone and then dont call for a week, dont think that they wont call you and be mad - they did call, and they were mad, and im sorry 9. i wonder when ill make that peace with god thing ive been throwing around for the past few yrs 10. and i dont really have a number ten, but i figured i should round out the list.

      i didnt have enough of these classes this week:  "We all have recollections of our first day back in class following a long, sleepy and enjoyable winter break. We stumbled into class like a bunch of semi-hibernating bears. We did not want to be there. Then, our instructor  invariably bearing an uncanny resemblance to the actor Ben Stein, he of the monotonous, droning voice  read the course syllabus aloud. Then, it was time to go. Then we would leave. That is, if we were still awake." - Univ of Nevada  maybe im just going to the wrong school.....its the first week of class, and ive had to attend every lab section and every discussion section and im already behind on homework.  i ask you, wheres the justice?

      alright so time for the review of the first day of school:  1. was late to my first class - this was to be expected.  was also late to my last class - this was also to be expected. 2. fell *really* hard on my butt outside my apt on ice that was disguised by a sidewalk covered in a thin layer of snow. this was not that embarrassing - just hurt a whole lot.  i fell, said "damn that hurt", got up and brushed myself off, only to hear the muffled laughter of a guy who appeared out of nowhere and asked "wow, are you okay? that looked like it really hurt."  - duh. no, it tickled ya moron. now my ass is sore and it hurts to sit.  i love ice.  3. classes.  they actually went really well - im gonna talk a lot in my tue/thurs classes it seems - one class has 5 ppl in it....yeah, thats right, 5.  wtf?! smallest class ive *ever* had in my entire life.   4. its going to be 1 degree on thurs.  wtf??? (sorry just hear my roommate in the living room yell abt it) 5. today was long, tiring, and im glad its over. 6. high point of the day: i had a great conversation with ira (man i miss u girl!!!) that kept me laughing thru my 6-8pm class 7. this is my first rest of the day.  i went from school, to work, then back to school, with only an hour break to eat. yeah suckage.  BUT highlight: if you call me, ill feel better. trust me on that =)

      why do people have to smell the same? i mean, so say u use a certain kind of cologne when youre in high school, now that youre  out  of high school you would probly want to change it to a more mature scent, right? wrong.  people tend to hold onto scents that they wear for years.  which brings me to the current, gripe i guess.  but dont think this is centralized on store-bought scents alone.  this totally applies to house smells, and car smells, and most of all: skin smell.  people have the same skin smell forever (obviously, cuz you cant really change your skin).  but still.  this becomes a small issue when people recognize you by smell.  i have to admit that i am def a person who identifies memories and feelings with smells.  the annoying part of this is that when you see someone later that you havent seen in say years, you remember quite vividly how you felt about them after giving them a hug and smelling their neck.  grrr to this.  id like to have more control over what memories rush into my head at what time.  in fact i think id like to have control over what memories *other people* have at what time.    just give me time.....i will take over the world.

      since there is time to be wasted, here comes another post.  i had some interesting moments driving to work this morning.  could be cuz i didnt have any ciggs (no, not cuz im out paul - but if u keep bumming off me every-frickin-day and never reimburse im gonna crack your face kid), but i just think today is a lil weird. some kid and his family moved into millie's old house on my block - millie was this kickass old lady who used to give out whole candy bars at halloween.  anyway, she died this summer and now another family moved in sometime while i was at school. so i came home last night kinda late and it turns out that they have a son with really cool hair who goes to west.  (all im gonna say about that encounter is that its EXTREMELY funny to be hit on outside of your own house - esp by a kid you very well could go to jail for - the kid has balls i must say.)  anyway, this kid and i end up leaving at the same time this morning and played car-tag down some streets.  (granted you cant go all that fast near my house in the morning - lots of traffic and lil kids going to school - but it was fun - i havent done that in years)  so that was one event.  the other was that i thought i saw kae and luke on the expressway but it turns out that it was just some white hippie people - very weird. (the scary thing was that the white girl really did look like kae (who is a dark filipino girl) from far away. of course i didnt realize it wasnt them till i almost had an accident.  new rule: if you think you see someone on the expressway, just call their cell - dont try to get their attention.

      so today is my last day at work.  YEE-HAW!! (yeah i just yee-hawed - shut it.)  and as all last days of work, something always happens.  today that something is my login expiring.  now, normally this would be pretty simple to fix, but the kid whos in charge of that stuff (yes, theres only one god help him) is in meetings all day at some other Walgreens corp location.  (did u kno that there are a lot of those up here?? weird....) so. now i cant login to novell to get to PBS to do MCs. i think theyre trying to come up with something for me to do.  i wouldnt mind bumming around all day if i had not done that most of this week.  and i was all about getting some shit done today.  (note: i can freely say this cuz i am unable to follow-thru on the comment).

      "The only limits are, as always, those of vision."  -- James Broughton  smart man that james.    i had an incredibly long post up this morning, but i took it down cuz it said a few things im not quite sure i really want to say (tho it did so in my usual vagueness and crazy metaphorical way).  today seems full of unanswered questions, and right now i just dont feel like asking.  i dont want to know the answers.  they could be good, yes, but they could also hurt - so for right now i think im just gonna lay low and chill.

      Your bass line has got me feeling fine Its filling up my mind  Ive got two pale hands up against the window pane Im shaking with the heat of my need again Starts in my feet, reverbs up to my brain Theres nothing I can do to revert the pain Im looking down to the street below Theres nothing in the way they move to show They too know what I know, They too hunger for the beast below  Listening to the radio I feel so out of place Theres a certain something missing that the treble cant erase I know you can tell just by looking at my face A word about my weakness Im totally addicted to bass a-waowa-ow a-waowa-ow  Theres nothing I can do to be cool I dont sleep till Ive had my fuel It frustrates if Im deprived A hunger that grates from deep inside Feel like Im doing time Imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime In my mind I must overcome the need to define Solitary silence of a faceless crime  Standing by the stereo Im feeling so alone With my back against the speaker and Im moving on my own Surrounded by so many and theyre staring at my face Theyre picking up my problem Im totally addicted to bass a-waowa-ow a-waowa-ow  Your bass line is shooting up my spine a-waowa-ow Your bass line has got me feeling fine Its filling up my mind  Summers at my window, I look down on the street People I see everywhere are tapping their feet Suddenly I realise in that look that I was wrong Everybodys grooving to their own song  Down at the scene below Theres something in the way they move to show They too know what I know They too hunger for the beast below  Rhythms running over me to wash away my fears The back beat of humanity it sweetens my tears There's something that's connected us down throughout the years Theres no need to feel so lonely Everyones addicted to bass a-waowa-ow  (a-waowa-ow)  Your bass line is shooting up my spine (Your bass line) Your bass line has got me feeling fine Its filling up my mind Your bass line is shooting up my spine (a-waowa-ow) Your bass line has got me feeling fine Its filling up my mind Your bass line is shooting up my spine (your bass line)   puretone.....kayla made me luv em....well that and the phat bass line =) gotta dance......gotta dance soon.....

      "omg - feel like im gonna puke. maybe if i just keep on writing ill be able to make it to 430.  i had planned on leaving(?) at 440 but that doesnt seem to be working out so well. wow, sickness. ugh. sickness.  i need to sleep.  which is ironic cuz i went to bed last night at 630pm, or wait - 730, it was after simpsons.  anyway, that was 730pm-7am and im not ired at all but i sure as hell feel lie i could get some sleep(?) in.  maybe i can sleep in the car? should i go home early? i feel like i should.  see, but if i stay till 330 then why cant...."                         -- my ramblings as i was fighting the urge to puke at work.    as you can see i didnt win.  i left off there to take care of business.  its amazing i can even read what i had written - its all lookin like scratches, barely forming words.  lil piece of advice: do NOT eat anything from the taco bell / KFC on dundee in waukegan.  i ate there for lunch yesterday with a pal and i was at my desk 20 mins later feeling like shit.  then i got to hurl, pack my shit up, and drive the hour long commute home. yay. fun.  much thanks to lauryn and illie tho for keeping me from passing out on the road - u guys kick major ass (and i hella miss u kidz too!!)  now back to the grind....

      ok so sometimes you come to realizations in life that hurt. wow, yeah hurt. and theres nothing that you can do to change it.  esp cuz you  had  a chance, but didnt do anything due to whatever reason, and now your just screwed.  im currently in this predicament in more ways than one.  im not sure what to do.  it just seems like from a whole lot of different angles, the bullshit just keeps coming.  its funny tho, cuz im not really depressed-sad, im more angry/cynical/annoyed-sad.  i mean yeah, some stuff has happened in the past few months of my life that had made me feel pretty crappy, but then theres also been some stuff that had made me quite happy - give and take as they say.  well, im thinking that ive undergone my share of bull, tho i kno that its not gonna be over till may when i finally figure out what the hell im gonna do with the rest of my life.  so for now theres this unending tunnel i seem to be in.    dont like tunnels.    im ready to go back and start school, and yet once i get there i kno im gonna be itching to leave.  im restless. i feel like ive gotten all i can from this place and point in my life and im ready to move.  then i get scared.  i know this. i know this area, i kno these ppl, i kno this life.  the unknown can be scary.  and yet quite thrilling.  the chance to establish your roots somewhere else.  somewhere less transient. somewhere thats yours. build a life. a career.  maybe finally get that dog ya always wanted.  *shrug*   then theres all the work that has to be done in order to do any of this.  and that is ugh.  i have no clue whats going to happen to me after graduation.  i know where ive been.  i know what ive done.  proud of some things, ashamed of others.  for the people who say they have no regrets, i am incredibly jealous of you.  i def have regrets.  but none that i wish to completely do over.  i think that the decisions that i made at the time were what i felt - and yet, i wish that i could have waited on some things instead of letting my impatience get the better of me, yet others times it was this impatience that got me things i never knew i even wanted to begin with.  another give and take.    i had a talk with a really old friend yesterday that made me realize that ive changed quite a bit over the years.  a little scary to hear cuz i kinda think im the same ole robyn of yesteryear, but i guess not.  a lot of the elements are the same, he had said, but the overall package and point is now different.  makes me sound like an essay.   ever realize that you didnt turn out to be the person you thought you were gonna be?   i guess i should take some advice from that writing metaphor.  my life kinda seems to mirror how i write stories.  theres always the little blurb of something to get me started.  the main idea, or theme if you will, that i branch everything else off of.  it sits there at the top of the first page, gets reread a dozen times, and in the end gets completely contradicted.  my stories never match the blurb in the beginning.  and im always completly surprised by this.  i ususally always end up taking it out cuz it confuses the reader to the point where they hate it (many ppl in my rhet class said this repeatedly). other times i would integrate it into the story in a different way by expanding on it and altering the original idea to fit the now completed story.  and then there are those few times where i just leave it the way it is.  leave the confusion and contradiction that it causes, and simply love the contrast of it all.    its almost like blindfolding people and having them walk forward, telling them that theyre almost the the edge of the building.  just a little more, keep going, a little more.....  but theres no edge to fall off of. just the wall thats 20 feet away from them which they might eventually get to if they just accept the fact that theyre bound to fall and walk steadily ahead.  they'll reach the relieving conclusion sooner this way, than how they cautiously creep along the floor, foot extended, hoping to catch the edge before it catches them.  i always end up removing the blindfold and showing them the truth.  some get mad at the ruse, some are disappointed (as if they  wanted  to fall), some just shrug, and others simply laugh.  its the ones who laugh that i love.  them, and the ones who walk steadily ahead knowing whats there and confronting it head-on.  the ones that laugh have my friendship, the ones that aren't afraid have my admiration.  the contrast of the blurb in the beginning with the rest of the story seems to be how my life goes.  i always have some idea of what i want to do or what is going to happen, and yet something different, if not the complete opposite, thing happens.   lesson to learn from this: dont have expectations or plans.  its never gonna turn out the way you envision.    and yet, if you dont have any plans, will you ever get anywhere? so maybe the lesson should be altered to: have plans, but expect them to change.  yeah, i think thats actually the best idea for right now.

      ok so stayin a lil late taking advantage of the sweet internet connection at work, and i decide to buy me a  urlLink beanie  to replace the one that got stolen from shady indiana people on new years eve grrr......    >>>>  anyway, me being the girl that i am, keep looking and come across a  urlLink swimsuit  that i really like - and also subsequently buy. grrrr. sometime i hate being a girl - its hard to afford.    when guys say they simply cannot afford a girlfriend i completely understand. hell, we're  expensive .  i mean, even if u kidz go dutch, it still costs money just to do things - rent a movie, play pool, etc.  and the cheap part where u kidz can just sit and talk for hours abt anything and everything, or just sit in silence, or hang with mutual friends, and all that jazz that takes up most relationship-time, doesnt come till AFTER youve spent all the money on the movies and pool and pizza and what not as youre "getting to know one another". ugh. annoying.   hmmm solution to problem? seems to be staring ya in the face: date people you already know.  saves money. and subsequently saves time as well.  but how much fun is that? hell if i only dated people i knew from when i was a kid id have dated that korean kid from cub scouts who gave me flowers and told me i had nice legs (in the 2nd grade mind u!!  - he obviously had an older brother), or the kidz i played spin the bottle with in junior high - ugh, um no thank you.  or better yet id still be with kurt the "saga" from high school - or worse: i couldve dated david adelman!!! (ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!)  whew. ok now THAT was scary.  ok, so dating people you already know doesnt look like the answer.  what if you just found people that were cool enuf on their own? meaning that they didnt need an outside event to make them interesting to you - now that would be cool.  to never do the "getting to know u" awkward thing and just throwing yourself into the pit of the mind.  you would quickly find out who had conversational value and who did not and would be able to make good, concrete decisions off of that.  also youd hang with your friends right away and they be able to tell ya if s/he was weird or not before you got blinded by "love".  ok well thats as bitter and cynical as i want to be today.  time to go home.

      did u ever have to refrain from saying something that just  wants  to come out? but you have to "bite your tongue" so to speak.  sometimes its almost like a physical thing.  the quip just wants to come out all on its own.  sometimes you let it, cuz theres no harm. other times your sharp tongue gets you into trouble and u kno that you shouldnt say what is in your head.  you clench your teeth and make a fist in frustration.  you have an answer that will  cut   your opponent, but you  cant  say it.  it sucks.

      theres nothing like relistening to saved voicemails to make u smile and laugh remembering friends and events of the past month.    lisa shouting abt finals being over for us and its time to go drink, lauryn needing to get her "stoopid fuzzy pants" from the apt, ira drawing out two words (im home) into a 5 minute message, brian asking for directions after hes already left, paul beggin for food cuz he has no meals left for the week, my mom swearing mid-lecture as she realizes that im still upstairs sleeping and not out "gallavanting" when i should be at my dads, wanj and rups yelling happy new year at the tops of their lungs, gino wishing me a happy kwanza and just about every other celebration that exists, and last but not least, ira giving a majorly loud burp into the phone mid-sentence.  yeah, that ones a classic.  i love my friends. =)

      so i got my computer fixed and it only cost me 100 bux. not bad considering i now have a 5x bigger HD and twice the memory that i originally had.  go rico.   prob is: i lost everything. the HD had died. damn HPs. so now i have to rebuild my software and music collections.    anyone who has quark gimme a call asap - i need it for next semester.  everyone else, im begging/pleading for everything practically, so if u can help me out id really appreciate it (plus youd get hugs, and depending on what u gave me perhaps a kiss - i did say  perhaps   so dont be expecting one or nuthin)   so gimme input kidz - what u got?

      ok explanation of mass email with really old pics:  my uncle sent those and i had JUST gotten shit the other day abt dresses once again and the pic made me go "ha! im wearing a dress in there - told him i wore dresses."  and u can follow the thought process from there.  and question ruthy gal - what praytell is so wrong with using a password containing hackers-with-the-cutie-JonnyLeeMiller ?  oh yeah, cuz u kno mine is!! yeah i havent really changed passwords in yrs - i kno i kno - bad - but no one knows but u and i trust u (hey if u cant trust a kid you threw up on who can ya trust) so no worries....just dont hack into my shit or ill have to break your face k? *smoochies*   so i got here a lil late today and all the coffees gone.  what office ediquette is that i ask u?? when u take the last cup, or next to the last, u make more - duh.  this is something i learned when i was 18 and had my first cubicle.  ppl are older here.  they should kno by now.    paul just got a job up in waukegan doin some web page design stuff for some company ive never heard of (perhaps cuz they dont have a webpage designed yet?) hopefully we'll be able to hook up here in white-mans town usa - then he could teach me thai (the lil that he knows) and we could talk abt other ppl while theyre in the room like my friends did on sunday - damn u dima and eugene - ira, i need your ass there to translate cuz they talk too fast - but debs and i got back at them by discussing some of their physical traits in tagalog hehehe   the girl in the cube next to me just put on some tribal music - verrrry nice  today looks good so far - only 8 more work days to go....

      Hey purty, it's me Ruthy!  I totally appreciated being one of the blessed on the mailing list that got pics of you in girlie dresses not to mention mom, pops, bro ...... like 12 years ago!  You are one straight up weirdo.  Well, I think I've seen em in your house for some reason.  Or is that just the gooooooood crack talking?  (you know, that crack I use all the time)  Anyhoo, I guess I've joined the blogger community and for anyone that really cares to impersonate me in this medium ... my password is so ridiculous.  Ok the password is NOT Hackers-with-the-cutieJonnyLeeMiller stupid, but really stupid.  But who would CHOOSE to be named Ruth?  No one believes that I'm not a Jewish girl with red hair OR an old jewish lady in her 80's (notice the recurring thing about Jewish girls ... I've been prejudiced for some reason thinking Ruth is a Jewish name ... but the ones I know are fabulous, really!), but get this, an American of Korean parentage.    So Rob!  My lovely friend of so many years, it all started in the 4th grade ... do we still talk?!  HELL YEAH!  Ok admittedly, not much ... but I guess its because I'm just not as fun as you are.  But that's ok.  I don't smoke either, so does that mean I see you more?  Or is that already down the hole?  Either way, we don't get together much, but it's all right ... you know I'm always here for you.  Really.  We Skokie girls, we got that bond fo life, word!  Well doll I may sound in this post, like I'm a few cards short of a deck, etc ... it's the Skokie fumes (you would know, the water reclamation plant yo).  So I'm going to call it quits and hope you live through another day at work.  S.W.A.K. see you soon.

      today seems long.  i have two more whole weeks left before school starts again.  to be honest, break has pretty much sucked.  there have been some good times, but overall its blown.  dont get me wrong, im hella glad im not runnin around trying to put out fires all day like i have to at school sometimes, but im def ready for a change of scenery in my life.  new surroundings, new work, new people, new life.  ever think that sometimes youre meant to do something, but u cant figure out what it is? maybe not even so much as "meant" to do something, but *want* to? its just really hard to put your finger on it....you have an idea, but thats all.    lately ive been sad.  multiple reasons for this, but in the end ill be ok.  everyone will.  remember that kidz.

      WARNING!!   Sentimental post ahead.  Do not read if you do not wish to feel a little mushy and reminiscent.  ok well i warned you......  so today i saw all these kids going to school (thanx to the major accident on the edens) - i passed all grades, middle school, junior high, and high school - deerfield has a kickass football field btw - while i watched them struggle with heavy bags and hang out with their friends outside the school buildings, i couldnt help but smile.  i almost missed being little again.  at the age where u didnt drive to school or take the bus, ya walked cuz it was only 4 blocks away (remember ruth??) and the crossing guard knew who u were and teased you if your brother was already there but u were late (as we all kno i always was), and you had to waddle a bit cuz of all the layers you had on to keep the frost from biting you (very scary thing when i was little - the frost could bite and biting hurts dontcha kno).  and then high school.  where u didnt take the bus unless u had to walk instead, sometimes taking the pace bus to get dropped off at the mall and get coffee or something to eat before going in, where ya car pooled with bunches of friends and yeah there was work, but there was also volleyball practice, basketball practice, and track practice practically year round (this morning i really wanted to go running deb - i think its the coldass weather - nuthin like years of running in snow to make your body think its time to get in shape again around this time) - for the many days that i was glad to get out of high school, when i look back now the bad times seemed to have faded and the good times shine with an almost golden hue - as if the days of hanging in the lunch room (did they ever get those pickles off of the ceiling?) and rollerblading thru the school (i cant believe we took on stairs with those things) and chilling in the hallways before classes started (the second floor of C hall will always belong to us af far as im concerned - that corner was mine) will be forever etched in my memory as days that i wish i could revisit from time to time.  there was such security and sense of facing the world with peers and friends who would stand by you for anything.  u never knew that you would drift apart or that people would die or that you would look at yourself years later only to realize that nothing is what it seems and essentially youre just trying to distract yourself from the impending end that will find you no matter what you do.  hmmm.  perhaps not the end per se, but more like reality.  youre surrounded by people who you call friends, but who would really be there if u needed them for something big - in reality about 5% of them, 10% if youre lucky - and of that 5/10%, how many are your childhood friends? overwhelming majority eh? yeah.  this is also something u learn.  theres a difference between kidz u hang with and kidz who youll talk to in 5 yrs.  this doesnt diminish the importance of the kidz u hang with, cuz without them you be hella bored a lot of the time, but it is impt to figure out who is gonna be there for the long haul and make sure you dont lose them in the shuffle.  theyre the impt ones.  the diamonds in the rough.  heres to those kidz in my life.  u kno who u are.  ive told you how ive felt at one time or another (probly with the aid of alcohol) and i love every one of you.  im your confidante, best friend, bridesmaid, soon to be roommate (hopefully in boston girl!!), relative, childhood playmate, teenage angster, teammate, classmate, and countless others.  you are all important to me in different ways and im thankful that youve been there for me when i needed you and im so grateful that i kno youll be there when i need you again.  *luv-n-hugz*

      ok so abt that no sleeping thing.....i pretty much passed the hell out last night at like 11 after getting off the phone where i nearly fell asleep on my friend (nah not that boring just that tired). and what do i wake up to? my brother and his gf making out and giggling, yes giggling, in his room which is about 6 feet away from mine. i wanted to throw something large and heavy at them.  but it also made me think - if i can hear them and both our doors are closed - e-gads!! i bet hes heard me and bfs before - majorly gross.  then u start listed the times where it would be bad if that happened, then u start to think abt people u havent seen in a long time or thought about in years and then u lie awake thinking, again. damn. there went that great sleep.  needless to say im at work and hella tired once more. when is break gonna be over so i can go back to school away from home stuff?   i think my job ends today - im sad and yet at the same time i wanna go back to school and be around ppl i miss - granted a lot of them would still be at home, but there are plenty of ppl there now (namely em, yeti, and lisa - i miss u kidz!!) home seems to have a lot of things attatched to it - this is both good and bad - but great thing happened: debs said that she def wants to move with me when i go to grad school. (omg awesome)  for those of u who dont kno debbie, shes been a friend of mine for like 8 yrs now and will graduate from art school in chicago with a graphic design degree - but anyway, coolest thing cuz to be honest, i feel a whole lot better abt leaving everything ive ever known now - you kno, now that i can take part of it with me =)  seriously tho, this really kicks ass esp cuz we had been talking the past few years of opening our own adv/graphic design company - real life is still scarily looming, dont get me wrong here, but it seems more bearable today.

      so the new year has brought many new paths with it and im still sittin on my butt in front of the crossroad sign.  grad school, portfolio school, job, etc - all are looming in front of me and deadlines are fast approaching.  be afraid. be very afraid.    my life seems to be cyclical lately: things coming back into it that had been there before but have since vanished.  and things seem to be leaving, ones that i counted on being there and others that i was surprised even became connected with me.  not intentionally trying to be philosophical today, it just seems to be what im thinkin.    another one of my friends broke up or is "on a break" with her boy - what is this? did i not get the break up memo?    "To Whom it May Concern,   This is to inform you that the months of November through Februrary are designated "end the relationship youre currently in" months.  Therefore, if you find yourself in what could be defined as a relationship of any sort during this time period, you are hereby required to end said relationship within two weeks after receiving this notice.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, The People in Charge"  yeah that memo.  well as for nyr's the biggest one i have is to quit smoking. yes, quit smoking. shut up all of u, i can SO do it.  granted, itll take me a while which is why ive given myself till the end of may to do so.  i may have new friends by that time seeing as 90% of my friends smoke, and im not too good with that self-control thing.  so dont be offended if i stop hangin out with ya - well, if i stop but u dont smoke, then i guess u can go ahead and be offended, but dont tell me - it might drive me to smoke again and u dont want to be responsible for killing me do you?

      so today is sad for numerous reasons. first, i have two essays to write that im still not done with.  granted i have had ample time in which to accomplish these, yet i still procrastinate.  i believe this is partly due to the fact that in reviewing my film paper assignment i saw that my teacher not only allows us to rewrite papers, but she encourages it. so basically that took care of any anxiety in that paper.  and my engl paper is so simple that i just cant seem to do it. why do things work like that? it is so easy, so just DO IT. no. u dont. u cant. cuz its too easy. youll do it later. cuz man, its easy as shit. it wont take you long. no worries. itll be easy. etc.  all that leads to just more procrastination and more munching (i like to eat when i "write" papers).  the second reason today is sad is cuz Beta, my illustrious fish, passed away today. it was a horrible feeling when i walked over to feed him and saw that there was no water in the bowl and he was laying on the gravel not moving.  turns out he was still alive (that crazy fish was a fighter lemme tell ya) and i put him in water where he began to hover and periodically flip out.  he swam diagonally as well.  yes, we all knew he was probly not gonna make it.  found out the reason there was no water was cuz the bowl cracked all around.  i found this out when i picked up the bowl to see how the hell all the water could have gotten out during the night and it basically shattered in my hands.  remaining water and the plants and the gravel went all over the table and the living room.  that was fun to clean up.  lesson learned: dont buy a glass bowl that is not fish specific when it is to be used to house a fish.  and finally the third thing that made today sad: mr rogers died today. today my friends, is a sad, sad day.   [10:04:46] BrwneyedQT69: did you hear that mr. Rogers died today? [10:04:51] daed513: WAHT?? [10:04:55] daed513: no!!!!!!!!!!! [10:05:02] BrwneyedQT69: yeah.....how sad [10:05:14] BrwneyedQT69: he was 74.... [10:05:18] daed513: omg [10:05:23] daed513: whered u hear this? [10:05:28] BrwneyedQT69: all over the news [10:05:35] BrwneyedQT69: everyone loved mr . rogers [10:05:41] BrwneyedQT69: he was a popular guy as you can see i was obviously shocked and appalled. *tear*  and now onto the essays again....but first, i think ill have a cigg....

      ive used 2,111 whenever mins so far this month.  its a good thing i have 889 whenever mins left till march 2nd.   (dont be jealous of this - i pay up the ass for those mins)  it seems i still have to write this paper - admittedly the hope that i had of it writing itself is dwindling...  whats up with the 13 hrs of sleep i had today??  plus the fact that im tired and this paper was due at 5.  i only have a page so far.  writers block sux.  how come u get blocked for the paper, but not for blog writing? like ever? oh yeah, cuz blogs are just mindless wastes of time (at least this one is) and papers actually have to say something intelligent.  grr to papers this week.

      i hate it when youre looking thru a catalogue of prospective classes to take for your masters, and you see a curriculum that you wish you had in undergrad.  damn art school.

      so the two apps that were late got accepted anyway (go boston and u of i).  i wasnt really excited to find that out tho. ive been really "eh" lately. dont really kno why, just feelin eh. i didnt do jack yesterday all day, but today looks good so far. im done with class till 6, and i have a ton of shit to do, (laundry, rent, etc) but im happier today.  its so nice out right now and i *swear* i smelled summer when i got out of my engl class this mornin, but by the time i actually stepped outside the smell had disappeared. =( i think natures bein tricky today. i have 4 essays due next week (one in each class cept for my campaigns class which doesnt have any essays - thank god) but im not worried yet.  check back on mon night tho and im sure thatll have changed.    i got an email from wanj today - i miss you wanj!!  it sux when friends that you used to chill with everyday go away to italy....and then they call you and tell you how they just went snowboarding in the alps....and all youre doin is checking your email in the engl lab....grr to ppl who have exciting lives at the moment, im waay jealous of you.  so ive been thinkin abt this spring break thing.  small roll call here: who has the week to do something other than work (paul u SUCK) and has some money to blow cuz im thinkin of goin on a road trip somewhere - it would be much fun.  im all abt the open highway, wind in your hair, nothing but time and road ahead thing.  im thinking of cali - if anyone needs to check out schools and such def think abt comin (we'll probly make a short stop at a few).  thinkin abt visiting nate too, so for those of you who havent seen the kid since he took off to start his "career" im sure he misses ya and you should come along. but yeah - the ideas out there - now lemme kno if you can/wanna go too.  for now i think im gonna take a lil nap, tho go me for waking up at 915 and making it to my class at 930 on time (it was awesome)   later.

      ugh i am so awake.  i royally fucked myself over last night by fucking around and missing the deadline by HALF A FREAKIN HOUR for one of my apps.  oh, and the other one cuz was on EASTERN FUCKING TIME so it was late.  so. yeah. i am offically the DUMBEST person on the planet.  do i even WANT to go to grad school?? apparantly not, cuz if i did i would have had all that stuff in on time right?? or perhaps its cuz i dont want to go to either of the schools who's deadlines i missed and im only applying to make my mother happy? hmm... id love to blame it on that idea, but have to take a lil responsibility here and just say that i am THE stoopidist person.  ugh i want to sleep and cant.   i want coffee but its cold out.   i want to feel like i didnt just fuck up my entire life.

      sometimes u want to change but its hard to.  you dont see the wrong until its everywhere.  sometimes you realize that youve hurt someone but its too late.  you wish so hard you could go back, but its impossible.  all thats left is you feeling horrible and the fact that you made someone else feel worse. and sometimes the worst feeling you can have is when you let a good friend down.    em, im really *really* sorry.

      so the past few days have been sort of horrendus.  ok not sort of, they pretty much sucked major ass.  and today, for some reason, i am smiled upon.  course of todays events:  i met with my dean to do a graduation audit and im all good - plus i can drop my media class if i want (which im thinking abt but i think lauren and the three other ppl in the class would kill me).  took a test in that class actually but i was no longer worried abt it cuz i can drop the sucker!  then was told that we're not gonna have a viewing in that class tonite - that means class was over for me for the day =) also, they had this HUGE book sale in the union - .50 per book or all u can carry to the cashier for 20 bux - hell i carried 30 bks (11 hardcovered textbooks too pal) - twas a sight to be seen - and alls i paid was 16.36!! yeah i got me some adv bks, mktg, psych, fiction stories, a play by congreve (hells yeah!) and some other misc shit that i found interesting.  illie had to come get me from the union - it was awesome.  and then to top today off, i got this email from my mom:  Rob,  Just wanted to say that I'm extremely proud of the way you're handling everything. I know it's not easy keeping up with classes, working on grad school applications, writing essays, chasing down letters of recommendation, etc. You're so amazing!!!  I love you, Mom  yeah. today rocks.

          OH-MY-FRIGGIN-GOD!!!   my mom is THE dopest woman on the planet. she just convinced the admissions ppl at U of Texas to take my application even tho its past the deadline (this is after i called myself and tried unsuccessfully to do so.)    fyi: u of T @ austin is like THE school for masters/portfolio grad degree (aside from VCU where i would give my right leg to attend)  so now i still have a chance there - and get this: she mentioned that im graduating from UIUC and the lady was all abt hearing abt me - so i guess the fact that we're rated no. 1 in the nation for undergrad in advertising  does  matter  =)  oh my god - i didnt royally screw myself over after all  this is def one of those times where i feel hella lucky to have her as my mom - she fucking kicks ass!!!

      ramblings that occurred at work today:  what happens when you avoid something for so long that you convince yourself that it never truely existed - only to have it thrust upon you with such force that you physically collapse from the sheer force of the unveiling?  Tears spring up from behind your eyelids and you can barely breathe from the heaviness in your chest.  Your stomach feels full of lead, and the scream inside you is building...and building....you clench your fists, digging your nails into the palm of your hand, trying to silence the pent up anger and dread that now surges thru your body.  You want to move but cant.  You want to leave, but that seems impossible.  All that exists is the reality you have been so desperately avoiding, the emptiness that is you, and the realization that you have to step up. now. this instant.  i hate it when you know someone so well that you notice little things about them that you are certain were for your benefit.  More specifically, them wearing a certain article of clothing, styling their hair a certain way, putting on certain cologne, etc. ARG!!! id rather just not kno, then kno and feel shitty abt it.  esp when it turns out that you cant be so sure that it was for you alone after all...  man, i want a cigarette....

      interesting thing a friend said today: dont simplify the situation, keep its complexity - give it what it deserves.  this can apply to so many things in my life that i tend to simplfy in order to make decisions, or to merely come to conclusions quicker.  i wonder how much ive been overlooking/missing out on/dismissing due to this way of thinking.  i def kno that ive made mistakes by doing so.  scary thought - what if all the decisions you made would have been different if you had just thought about them more?

      recap of break: did a lot of driving. saw some ppl i hadnt seen in months. was spoiled by the large amt of time i spent with my boy =) ate at some good restaurants. became really *really* broke. didnt get as much work done as i hoped (of course). and didnt sleep as much as i wanted. but overall it was nice.  now i wait for my roomies to come back home. living alone for the past few days has made me realize that i cannot live alone. id go insane. im too much of a ppl person. i crave human contact at all hours. only abt an hour till they return. yay =)

      i wonder if the drunken phone calls will be a nightly occurance.  i received a second one tonight and enjoyed it.  if they continue, i shall look forward to them.  on another note, i got a B on my 311 test.  this kidz is frankly quite amazing considering i only read 2, countem 2, of the 25 articles that we had to read for this class.  i expected to bomb this test.  i spent the weekend screwing around and then tried to cram stuff in my head that day of.  i was completely happy with the C i figured i got on the test considering i had put little to no effort into preparing for it.  however, it turns out that amy's mad crash course an hour b4 the exam helped me enuf to get a B (well that and the fact that the prof curved the test after the highest grade was a 86 - but whos keeping track)  also in todays good news, i blew away my media prof in class - and he *offered* to give me a rec letter for grad school - way cool of this guy.  im really enjoying his class - it makes me realize how much i love my major and how much im gonna enjoy my job when i finish school.    now i get to read a mystery novel b4 i sleep - big yay - this semester is kickass, im not doing an insane amt of work and im really genuinely happy with my classes. now if only i could say that abt other stuff in my life....*shrug* leaving that for another rant on another day.

      ok so ive only had one class so far, but already the drunkeness that is Unofficial St. Patricks Day has been revealed.  this kid came to disc so drunk he could barely enter the room. he had one of the leprechaun hats on and a bunch of stickers on his face.  i wonder if he knew he reeeked of beer - quite funny cuz my TA commented on it and he looked all surprised. anyway, he took the quiz, then left with a bellowing "HAPPY SAINT PATTYS DAY!!"  then on my way to the lab, a crowd of kids dressed in green came stauntering down the quad and one yelled "ITS UNOFFICIAL ST. PATRICKS DAY!!  IF YOURE NOT DRUNK,  GET  DRUNK!!"  the visiting kids and their parents probly didnt appreciate that so much (yeah today is some all college visit thing day as well as engineering open house - way to be smart u of i - next yr u might not want to schedule events where there are tons of visitors on campus the same day that tons of kids will be drunk off their asses and wandering the streets)  so far today has been on the amusing side.  ran into amy, courtny, paul, and lisa so far and everyone is in good spirits.  it might be the weather, yes, it might be cuz green beer is good, but it also might be the fact that everyone i kno is either getting drunk or going to get drunk b4 the sun goes down.  ahh how im going to miss u of i traditions =)

      i dont mean to do a carry over of yesterdays rants, but i find this incredibly weird. my mom gave me 500 bux this morning. yay u say? not really. only $300 of it is for rent (rent is $358) and the other two hundred are advances of my next two years christmas gifts ($100 x 2). so basically i dont have any christmas gifts for the next two years.  now, granted i am older and this shouldnt bother me, but it does a little. at the same time i probably wont be home next year or the year after, so lack of gifts wont be the thing on my mind. (see, im rationalizing here)  the scary thing is, is that i owe my mother so much money that shes now taking it out of future gifts. (daaamn) anyway, today is a new day (thank god) and its friday (big ups to this) and i have a lot to do (im a fan of using parentheses today)  i think i need a lil DIF to start the day....illie, i am NOT obsessed!! =)

      my dad just called me to get sympathy cuz hes just leaving work. dude. youre an accountant. and what season is it? oh yeah, its TAX season. so perhaps you might have a lot of work to do, whodathunkit.  (you might think that this is unfeeling of me, but if u had to listen to him whine abt every little thing all the goddang time like  he  was the kid and  you  were the parent, youd be annoyed when he does it too.) anyway, he did give details that my bro is currently in canada at the moment and grandma mert (my stepmom's mom) is having a birthday party next sunday that i MUST attend.   interesting that my mother didnt tell me abt my bro being gone, tho how could she with all the yelling. but this does explain the extra attention ive been getting the past few days, which ive def noticed by the increase in the length and frequency of yelling.  if shes busy i get shot a quick email. if shes not, i get a phone call at 730am that lasts abt an hour.   be glad that you are not her child.

      theres nothing like getting woken up at 730am with a phone call from your mom yelling her head off at you for something u did. the one nice thing was that i was still comatose so i didnt really start listening till abt 15 mins in, but that caused more yelling and now its almost 830 and i just get to start my day. wow, today already sucks and i havent even left my room yet. [that post got recovered by blogger - go them] now im off to class...

      today has started off SO great:  Hi, Robyn! I have discussed your situation with prof. Deck. We have  finally decided that your exam will get full credit points.  Best, Cristina  this was an issue cuz i was a dumbass and went to the wrong disc section for my midterm. yeah, id never done that b4, but i choose the day of the midterm to do it - AND it said all over the study guide, as well as the actual test, that if you were enrolled in the 1pm section you CANNOT take the 2pm section test, and vice versa. i took the test anyway cuz i didnt kno what to do, and was hella pissed at myself thinking that i just blew the A i had in this class - i scared a girl in the bathroom of the engl bldg when i was kicking the wall and mumbling obscenities in there after the test - BUT good luck prevails and everything ended okay as you can see above. yay! granted this just kinda adds to my whole slackerness-type qualities that are quickly developing (or emerging) this year, but i am happy. - plus i didnt have work today and got to sleep in =) if it just wasnt so damn cold out....

      ive been reading these  urlLink articles   by eric santos and i agree with some of his opinions and wholly disagree with others.  i think his  urlLink first article  was great at capturing the idea that he was not speaking for the entire minority population, but this second one moves a bit from that.  ive personally met this kid and he def had some strong views that are toned down for his articles.  even tho i dont always agree with him completely, i wonder if that is a good thing...i mean what hes asking for, and commenting on, seems to call for swift action.  action that seems to be best fueled thru strong, solid opinions.  in reality tho, these articles make me supremely sad.  i believe that attention needs and deserves to be given, but unfortunately the articles are also representations of the vast amount of hate present in the world and on our campus. sadness.   however, what i find amusing abt the whole thing is that he is now writing for The Conscience - an independant news source soon to hit the CU area - because of his strong feelings on the lack of minority coverage in the DI.  interesting that he said this mon night, and yet these articles run till next week....weirdness, and yet im comforted by the fact that a lil recognition is def not enuf for this kid. i like that hes on my team.

      how cute is my mom: "I forgot to mention that if we do end up getting you that lap top for graduation, you probably should get a Mac, which I understand is better for graphic displays, etc. (I learned that from Felicity - that was what Noel believed anyway!!!).  Then you'd have both your desk top PC and the lap top Mac - that is if you need them both, of course."

      This week has been the week from hell.  I just want it to be over with.  First off, I found out that someone tried to get a credit card with my name and had to spend hours on the phone trying to fix that (which I am still not done clearing up yet and probly won't be for a long time).  Then I got in semi-big trouble for neglecting to do something that I should have taken care of at the beginning of the semester, but cuz I'm a lazy-ass I didn't and got a written warning for it.  That day sucked.  Home life sucks.  I am actually beginning to hate coming back to my apt cuz on account of a certain someone.  I also don't call the apt for fear she will pick up.  The hostility is just something that I don't feel is necessary and I hate how it divides my friends, esp my other roomie (cuz she's awesome as hell). I've been told that it's not my fault, but if it's not then why doesn't she just get over herself already and start acting like a normal human being to me.  I'm also going through pre-graduation freak out cuz I still have no plan yet as to what I want to do with the rest of my life.  And there are some things that had always seemed so important that now I don't even give two shits about.  Also I'm feeling distanced from people - I don't know who is doing it, me or them, but I can def feel it.  It's not fun.  This whole week just sucks ass.   I want to cry, but can't.   I want to scream until my voice gives out.    I want to be away from here.

      This goes out to Nate the "Oregon-Recluse": Yo dawg - since you skipped town with my cds, then came back during break but DIDN'T give them back to me, and proceeded to vanish into thin air, I've had to replace the cds you took - only I tend to be a trusting friend with a bad memory, so I don't know which ones you have.  So you BEST get in contact with me so I can get them back from you b4 I leave the state and vanish.  Ring me up kid.

      So today I broke down.  I had 4 drags of a cigarette.  Today was just one of those days that sucks the will-power right out of you.  At least I lasted over a week, including two house parties.  Funny thing, I actually coughed on my first drag - it's def been a while since I've done that. I don't plan on taking it up again any time soon tho - esp cuz that fourth drag made me dizzy as fuck.   I def am not a fan of today tho.  Yes, April 27th 2003 can suck my dick.  side note: Mike this had nuthin to do with your birthday kid - hope you had a great one =)

      I'm not sure if she was being sarcastic of not, but I def laughed when I read this:  -------------------- Hi Rob,  Another possibility just occurred to me. Wouldn't it be great if you got the internship at Millward Brown, and they liked you so much they offered you a full time position in the fall? Let's say they made you a great offer for a permanent position including full tuition reimbursement - in fact it would be so good, you couldn't possibly refuse. You accept the great offer, get an apartment in Lincoln Park with Debbie, and take evening classes at DePaul!!!! [I bet you anything, most of the classes will be offered in the evening since most people work on their Master's while working full time.] Voila!!! You'll have it all - you'll be close to Brian, have your own apartment, AND be working on your Master's degree which would be fully paid for by Millward Brown so you wouldn't end up with massive loans that you would be spending the next 10 years paying off!!! How's that??? [Just remember, every great success story starts with a dream, which somehow gets formulated into a plan, which then gets executed, and eventually becomes reality.]  Let me know what you think of this great possibility.  I love you, Mom --------------------  Sometimes I think she's on crack.  Honestly, it would not surprise me.  Some legalized form of crack that is approved by the FDA, that's non-habit forming, and that she doesn't have to snort, shoot, or otherwise taste.  Um....yeah.

      Update: Still no ciggs - 113 hrs/5 days strong. No patches, no gum, no nothing but myself. I rock.  This started out as a mere "I'm just don't feel like buying ciggs today" and has developed into a "Wow Robyn, you quit smoking?" Since I have never actually tried to quit smoking before,  (I knew I had to stop at some point, I was just politely ignoring when that point would happen), the plan was to cut down gradually, smoking only on weekends, then only when drinking, etc. Actually, maybe I should have reversed those two....Anyway, I have yet to be really tested on this kick, so we'll see how things go.  The physical addiction is not the problem - not at all actually - the mental change is what's getting to me.  I have to actually decide  not  to have a cigarette more times during the day than I decide to pee for christ's sake.  Anyone ever notice that when you smoke you're the only one who's smoking, but when you don't smoke everyone and their DOG is smoking? Yes, dogs smoke.  It's a filthy habit that they really must break, but at least it allows them to wear those smoking jackets which are adorable on little dogs.  (Ok, if you know me at all you will know that I am completely kidding about this.  Dog clothes are one of the dumbest inventions this world has ever come up with, and the people who subject their animals to such humiliation should be taken into the street and shot.) On a less murderous yet related note, I was pleasantly reminded of how good of a movie Pulp Fiction was in film class last night, but damn is there a lot of smoking in that movie.  I guess I better get going on writing this paper.

      I got a second interview for  urlLink Millward Brown !!  They were "very impressed" with me and want me to come up to Chicago within the next week and a half to do a formal interview.  Yay!  Granted, this is not my dream job - far from it in fact, I like to get paid when I work, but it def beefs up the resume.  Now if I could only get a paying internship to go along with this non-paying one, I'd be set for the summer =)

      I love it when you leave the house pissed, get in your car, and drive off to Offspring blasting in your ears.  It's funny how little things can make a world of difference.  (I'm still kinda mad tho) - I hate how certain people just get under your skin no matter how hard you try not to let them.  There are certain people at UIUC that I will def NOT miss when I leave.  Yeah, they know who they are.  And if they don't, I'll be sure to let them know by the time I'm gone.

      I swear to God I have a guardian angel.  That's the only way I can explain my luck sometimes.  The tape that I was to use for my paper is damaged, so I can't do that part of the paper (abt 5 pgs) - it literally cuts my paper in half and now I'll def be able to finish by 1130am when it's due.  I emailed my prof last night and he's cool with me borrowing a different tape and writing that portion of the paper later.   Insane my world sometimes is.   Incredibly lucky am I.

      I just came from 4, count'em 4, different libraries.  This should not have surprised me considering we have the largest public university library system in the world. (I know this because it is listed on my school's webpage Stanish). Anyway, I was searching for the Journal of Popular Film and Television - which I ultimately did find in the English Library (which interestingly is not located in the English Building like a normal person would think, but on the third floor of the Main Library, all the way in the back where no one would ever know that its there).  The Main Library is way cool btw - I'd love to get locked in there one night so I could go around and just explore. Like that book we read when we were little about the brother and sister who get locked in a museum. I don't remember the title, but the girl played the violin and paintings by Michaelangelo were muy importante in the story. I bet Stan knows.  I loved that book in like 3rd grade, or whenever it was that I read it. Wow, tangent. Currently I'm in the Undergrad (technically the 5th library I have been in today) waiting for some photocopies to be made by this bitchy woman who informed me that I could charge copies to my student account (which I was incredibly happy abt considering I only have a dollar to my name right now), but that I would have to wait an hour.Dang. Well I'm not in the best of spirits either considering this morning has been filled with run-arounds and its so dang cold out. What happened? This weekend was beautiful, and now this.     Also, I want to apologize in advance if I snap at anyone or seem bitchy in any way, shape, or form: I haven't had a cigarette in over 24 hrs.  I dont know if this is gonna continue, all I know is that I've been smoking at an alarming rate for me recently and I think is a good idea to take a step back sometimes.  Anyway, this seems to becoming a challenge (thanx Kara), so we'll see how long it lasts.  Lina's in front of me in the lab right now working on her Econ that she hates - Hey Lina!! =) (she's such cutie)  I think I'm gonna go grab from coffee from espresso - thank god for frequent buyer cards - and chill till my class at 4.

      days have been good this week. ive been happy =)  i have work to do, but im okay. school is almost done, wow. where did this year go?? im really grateful for a lot of things in my life.  i guess this whole graduating thing makes you reflect more than usual, but i def am happy with the years ive spent here with all you kidz. i look forward to whatever comes next: be it grad school, portfolio school, or *gasp* a job.  time will tell.  i finally got to the point where im just kind of chillin waiting for it all to wrap up. admittedly i am sad, but that is to be expected.  mostly i am happy that i got to know so many of you kids through the years, and im thankful that i have made some really great memories that i'll take with me when i leave.  wow, this post got sappy. u kno i luv u tho =)

      my mommy came to visit this weekend for moms weekend.  it was fun - i love being the baby =) scandal tho: she took off the side-view mirror of a car in my parking lot. i was pretty sure no one saw and was willing to look the other way, but my mom has this conscience thing and there ended up being a phone tag/police involved thing. ohh fun. but on the up side, she had a lot of fun and she was happy with the weekend (yay - lots of planning usually goes into these weekends so when they go good im happy) and she bought me a graduation dress - which is cool - and surprisingly i found this other dress that i loved that she also ended up getting for me. yeah i kno, i bought a dress for no occasion other than i thought it was cute. ill turn into a girl eventually i spose. now i happily get to nap before i work on homework =)

      i love my gangster film TA.  i wrote him an email telling him that i screwed up on my paper (i used an article from a time period that was off-limits) and was wondering if i could get the go-ahead to use it anyway (even tho i have yet to write the paper - yeah yeah i kno, im writing my 260 response so chill) and this is what he replied with: "Robyn, 	I am very pissed. Words cannot descirbe how mad I am right now, I want you to rewrite your paper at 37 pages long and you must incorporate all the films and all the articles. 	Actually, what you're doing is fine. Nevermind. Elliot Enjoy the sarcasm."  anyone else think he went to the bars tonite? =) nevertheless, he kicks ass. (and yes chassie, he is a cutie)

      sometimes a heartfelt "i miss you and im glad you came to visit me, i really needed you" is all it takes for you to smile and feel really good about something small you did for a friend. that was the good part of today.  (as well as it being mel's bday and me being a lil intoxicated as i attempt to write my paper now) but the fact that i am here trying to do my paper, and not out getting even more drunk, is proof of my ability to tell others no - or to avoid them so i dont have to. sorry chucky. =( and i will start on my paper now.  well, after the cigg im abt to have. then i start. i swear.

      Time for a mindless rant. (This is your forewarning).  Theres an incredible amount of stress that I feel lately and a large weight of uncertainty that seems to be certain (ha!) to bring me to my end - or otherwise pointless existence that occurs post-graduation.  As many, if not all, of you know - I do not have plans as of yet after graduation.  (Schools that you have applied to, but have yet to get IN to do not count Chris). I dont like not knowing.  The not knowing is literally making me push the daily thoughts of impending doom back in a corner of my mind, to be dealt with at 430am when I cant sleep and cant help but think abt them.  I have talked to diff ppl abt the situation, but have found solace in none. I almost just want to move to NY (even tho I dont want to live in NY but its the adv Mecca of the US) or to Cali (which has a surprising number of adv jobs listed) and simply see what happens. Anyway, basically I dont know where I'm going or what Ill be doing and there are only 5 more weeks of school left.  This summer Ill be in Chicago. I know that much. Yay for that. But after? Endless possibilities swarm around me with outside factors of varying degrees inflicting their opinions and the result is a def: I dont know what I am going to do.  I know that some of you cannot relate (go Leslie, Jennie D., Mike, Tom, Beth, and Doug - u kidz get my congrats on the jobs and secure futures u got going on), but as for the rest of us - I feel like running till I get to a large field.  And then I keep running till I lose all sense of direction and am left lying on my back staring at the sky and breathing so hard I cant think.

      i have a gripe abt my campaigns class.  well, classes in general that do this i suppose, but this class has done it twice: make you buy a book and then decide not to use it, but not telling you till its too late to return the book and basically making you keep the book cuz its generally better to have a $25 book in your backpack than $1.50 in your pocket.  we were to learn abt Nike and its campaigns throughout the recent decades (which i was cool with), but we arent reading Nike anymore and i now own a $25 book on the Nike campaigns of the 20th century.  which, mind you, i would be completely happy reading for free in my local bookstore, but owning? not so much.

      and u thought your mom was sarcastic? nuh-uh. my mom wins top prize in that category:  Since there's going to be a party over at Emily's tonight, you'll have to drop all your school homework, grad school applications, search for summer employment, search for summer sublet, and rush over there - they'll be waiting for Robyn, the party animal, to whom socializing with friends takes top priority over everything else. Please keep this in mind.

      So I had a stimulating conversation with one of my friends yesterday that really got me thinking.  I'm at the point in my life where I can do anything.  I can move to a diff city, I can travel around the world (which I would love to do and if any of you would like to finance my European excursion, please let me know), I can find a job, get an apartment, and generally start my life.  Yeah I'm scared.  I know this grad school thing is a way of avoiding that inevitable, and that scares me too.  I wish that I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life, then I would at least feel somewhat comfy in the fact that I *had* a plan.  What is most disheartening is that more than one person this week has told me that I seem to have no "focus".  I agree, but I'm not sure how I am to find this so-called "focus" - it eludes me and I wish that there was some sort of focus-homing device that I could buy off the internet or something.  Also, I almost see myself trying to land a job in Chicago and living with Deb on the north side for a few years, which, don't get me wrong here, would be awesome, but I know that I would always have this yearning to go somewhere else.  I think this is the best time to do that, but it also makes me sad cuz at the same time there is a lot here for me.  *sigh*  Sometimes life decisions are a lot more complex and difficult than I once thought.

      Okay so I had this semi-long post that got deleted when my friend sent me a link of our pal Ryan who I haven't seen in over 3 yrs.  Since his pic deleted my post, I'm posting his  urlLink pic . See, now the funny thing is, Ryan was an Abercrombie-model type guy when I hung out with him.  Nice muscles, beautiful tattoo, gorgeous eyes, and all round nice guy.  Now? Well, I think he could be mistaken for the can guy.  And what is with the iguana??

I can't breathe, I have a fever, I'm coughing up a lung every two minutes, and I want to crawl in a hole and be put out of my misery.  I hate being sick.

      I've finished my undergraduate career.  Scary, yet thrilling at the same time.  Great to be done, but scared cuz I have no idea what I'll be doing after August.  Graduation went well considering everything, and I'm just really glad I didn't fall on my face when I walked across the stage (which btw I now have on video thanx to Brian).  I'm really tired.  That's about it really.  I have a lot of things to get done in the next two weeks, which I'm going to try and cram into one week if possible.  I'm not extremely excited yet either.  Perhaps the "graduated" feeling will hit me sometime soon, but as of right now I want to go back to bed. =)   Cool things abt yesterday: My parents didn't kill one another or break out into a screaming fight or anything, my friends from home completely got along with my friends from college, I now have my name carved into a table at Murphy's thanks to Emily, I don't have to do any more papers for school (I gotta do grad school appl papers tho but they don't really count), and my life isn't determined until grades come in on Thursday - so talk to me then, I might not be as relaxed.

      Confirmed B in film theory. This rocks. Well, not really cuz I was pretty sure I was gonna get a B anyway.  I wonder if I had done the extra credit paper if my grade would have changed.  Ah well, no matter.  I'm currently working on my media final study guide thing.  These things are always so goddang long.  If I get straight Bs this semester I will not only be shocked and amazed but thankful as all hell - I was a killer slacker this year.   Small up: I calculated my jr/sr gpa and it's 3.33 (go me!)

I want to leave here. I want to leave everything that is here, here.  Cept some ppl - don't worry Em, wherever I am you know I'll call u  =)   Back to the grind that is not over till Friday night....

I think that's the order of importance too.  Well, the rewrite and the final paper will probly change themselves around.   Damn today. Damn, damn today.  And for those of you who call me a slacker, and I'll admit rightly so sometimes, I actually *could not* do work last night cuz of the tornados that were in our area causing all of us to stay inside and use candles and such - damn tornados.  I hate living in central IL.

      My mom sent this to me b/c it made her think of me....hmm....I would def agree!!  Once upon a time, in a land far away, a beautiful, independent, self-assured princess happened upon a frog as she sat, contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle. The frog hopped into the princess' lap and said: Elegant Lady, I was once a handsome prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me. One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper, young prince that I am and then, my sweet, we can marry and setup housekeeping in your castle with my mother, where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy doing so.  That night, as the princess dined sumptuously on a repast of lightly sautéed frog legs seasoned in a white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled and thought to herself:  I don't f---ing think so.

      Today was full of ups and downs.  I'll do a comprehensive list to make it easier:  Ups: I got tickets to my graduation even though I was past the deadline. Now my mom won't murder me. This is good. I got another extension on my engl paper that is taking me forever and a day to do. My roommate is being nice this week.  It's nice when home life isn't really stressful. I totally got an A on my Afro final and I got an A on my Afro paper that I got back today - each 20% of my grade - w00t!!  Downs: I found out that I got a C in 311 - by TWO questions!!! No, she doesn't give extra credit, or pluses or minuses, or change grades.  So my 79.6 could have been a 70.1 and I would have gotten the same grade. wtf?! Fair? I think not... I'm being phased out of a group of friends.  I know I'm leaving and that they'll still be here next year, but being replaced really hurts. I wrote over 15 pages of test essays today and my hand feels like it's going to fall off. It's my birthday tomorrow and no one can celebrate with me cuz it's finals week  - even I can't celebrate cuz I have a final on wed =(  That was today.

      Happy late 21st birthdays to Ileana and Melissa - you kidz rock =)  In other news, I was offered two internships this week.  I'm not sure which one I'll be taking just yet, but I think I might be taking both if I can swing it.  Yes that means I'll be working my ass off, but it also hopefully means that I'll have money AND work experience this summer.  The down side is that none of you will ever see me.  Wait - not true.  Ruth, you probly will but I think that's mostly cuz you live 7 blocks away and the commute isn't too strenuous.  Finals start today.  Luckily I don't have any till Monday, but I go till Friday at 430. Bogus. I'm hella excited abt graduation tho - I want it to be now.  All good things may come to those who wait, but I want my fun now =)  Today was actually a good day.  Not much happened, and I'm happy (I get to see my boy tomorrow).    Now on to the endless paper writing.  I don't think I'll miss that much when I leave.  Small grrr to the papers.

      So I was complaining a few weeks ago that I had no plans for the summer and that I didn't know what I was going to do.  Now I think I have too many things to do.  Why can't life ever be balanced?  Better question (or at least more specific to my needs at the moment): Do you take a job that pays well, but will probly be annoying as hell and a waste of your time? Or do you take a job that pays nothing but is good experience and will probly help you land a job in your field in the future?  Then there is the other path. (Which has not presented itself yet, but it'd be awesome if it did): The job that pays well   and   is in your field, thereby giving you the benefits of both previously discussed jobs. *sigh* Why can't life ever be balanced? Or I guess the real question, Why can't life ever be exactly what you want it to be?

       Christopher Zuehlke , you have just made the list of  People Robyn is Pissed Off At . Granted this list has been growing, it seems exponentially this week in fact, but you are on it nonetheless.  You know why you are on it, and no, I do not know when you will be off of it.  Def not by this weekend though, so you might not want to come by me at Devo's party.  I will not take any responsibility for what I may do if you take that risk.  Sorry and good day.

      Quitting smoking is really hard when you're having the week-from-hell. The week-from-hell also increases your alcohol intake three-fold. Four-fold if you don't smoke while drinking, and take a drink every time you want a cigarette as I tend to do. Only seven more hours till I'll be at the bar.  Ahh the anticipation.

      Mondays sometimes bite, but today is actually not that bad.  I just got into my second job for the day to watch everyone in my department take the new guy out to lunch - this means: 1. I missed a free lunch, damn. 2. They'll be gone for at least an hour and a half.  So that means I get to bum around the submissions room and play on the internet for a bit.  =) At least I don't have to stare at Acrobat just yet (very grateful for this).  It's nice out today, but too hot.  I'm a mid-seventies girl.  I like t-shirt weather and love sweatshirt weather. Explains all the sweatshirts I own huh? Recap of weekend: Went to Zentra on Friday night (apparently this used to be a pretty diverse place but is now overrun by Indian and Asian people) for Debbie's bday.  Twas muy fun.  I drank more than I thought I should have, but did not puke  and  I got props on my dancing from the best dancer in the club (that was awesome as hell).  Overall I had a really good time - and Debs fell a couple of times heehee - she got drunk off of two shots!! Well, she is pretty little... Saturday, after fighting a harsh hangover, I hung out with Stanish downtown.  We went to the Museum of Contemporary Art which was awesome.  It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be tho, but the exhibits were kickass.  You should go.  General "you" that is.  Then we had dinner with my mom.  Yeah that was fun.  Having two people who love to pick on you in the same place able to join forces? Not a good idea.  Why do the ones I love always have to make fun of me? Oh yeah, cuz I make fun of them first! =) Then later that night I traveled down to U of I and hung out with my Paulie.  Yeah the same Paul who got the brand new Civic for graduation.  But get this: since it's a graduation present, and he doesn't technically graduate till he finishes summer school, his parents aren't letting him have the car till he's done. Hehehe.  I love the Tongyoos. Did some chilling with Em and Sean as well and packed for the last 5 hrs b4 loading up my car with everything it could hold and heading back home.  How the hell did I acquire so much stuff??  I have about a month left to determine what's going on with my life.  Hopefully I'll be able to make a decision soon, and it'll be one I'm happy with.  I think the biggest fear of it all is being stuck somewhere I don't want to be or stuck in something I don't want to do. *Ahem* current jobs *Ahem* Yeah, so I better go get something done b4 they get back - can't lose the only job that pays.

      This weekend was really nice.  I went down to Purdue to visit some friends and help Stanish move some stuff (okay so I didn't help all that much, but I carried an amp and a rice cooker - they count).  What was best about the weekend was that I didn't have to think about all the stuff that's been majorly stressing me out the past few weeks (ie post-college life). It was really cool just to relax and hang out.  Hell we watched movies for 4 hrs on Saturday - it was great.  I miss not caring what time it was till late and it was time to go out.  I miss hanging out with ppl till 4am.  This weekend was a nice reminder of how cool my friends at Purdue are, and how much I'm going to miss college life.  All in all, lots happier tonight than I was in a long time.

      Yeah haven't written in awhile - seems to be the trend with ppl tho.  I've been working 12 hr days in different cubes, yet still in the same trapped hole.  The last thing I want to do when I get home is to get back on a computer and write about anything.  Sorry folks.  Life has been less than happy lately.  I've also been extremely tired and I'm wondering if I even should go to grad school.  I hate the indecision.  Especially when it's coupled with the fact that my mother keeps telling me to get a job and move out of the house.  Yeah, that's fun lemme tell ya.  Basically, I'm wondering when I'll be in a good mood.  When that happens I bet I write something nice, or at least somewhat interesting.  Life post-college seems to be sucking. A lot.

      Currently typing up my last grad school essay (small yay) and I thought I'd give you kidz a lil excerpt (mainly cuz it made me smile): "I believe that I would be an asset to this program because I am currently typing without looking at the keys.  This is soooo weird!!  When was I able to do this?? Personally I do not think that I should be able to be typing so much without looking at least a little bit.  Its kida vcool " And then I stopped cuz I screwed up.  Ahh the fun of the college application essays.....

      Why do people leave messages that start with that phrase?  Who is this "me"?  I am guilty of doing this myself once or twice - in fact I think I did it today - but I start to wonder when I check my messages and three out of the four start with "Hey Robyn, it's me" - that's nice.  Now who are you?  Granted I do know who these ppl are, so I think the point of this post is merely to voice my intrigue about why everyone uses this phrasing when leaving a message, but I felt compelled to write about it.  I also wish to comment on voices/tones that people use.  I have recently been accused of this (wrongly accused I think) and I would like to know who gets the "special" tone.  You know what I mean.  That tone of voice that is softer, sweeter, and more gentle than your regular voice.  And guys don't cop out on this - you completely have a voice - I've witnessed it too many times.  Boyfriends and girlfriends get the tone, but who else?  Is the voice locked into one particular person or one particular emotional state?  Perhaps it is related to where you place the person you are talking to in your life - meaning your little niece or nephew gets the voice, but your 25 yr old sister doesn't.  Therefore age becomes a factor as well.  These are the thoughts that run thru my head as I mindlessly mess around with acrobat all day.  Fun huh?

      Why is it that people who come in late in the morning always have food with them?  I think they do this just to torment the people who have been here since 730 without food and who are almost passing out from lack of sustenance.  It's scary how delicious McDonalds smells when you haven't eaten anything for over 10 hours.

      I bet everyone feels this way, but today I have the need to voice my opinion on the topic.  This weekend was fun, I got lots of sleep, got to hang out with friends, and generally relaxed a little.  I didn't do anything on Sunday except Becka's graduation party (the family one) so I came home with lots o Filipino food (that I'm probly not going to eat) thanx to Mrs. Ranchero.  I'm so tired right now it's not even funny.  In fact I feel a little sick too.  I hat this - I need to be getting more sleep.  Oh btw - Becka's non-family gathering is this Wednesday at Fullerton beach 5pm - I was told to spread the word, since I'm lazy this seemed like the easiest way to do that. =)  Updat on SF:  I found a place to live - it's not permanent but it will do till I can find an apt somewhere and get my stuff shipped to me.  I leave on the 30th or 31st of August (have yet to buy plane ticket)  It's getting worse.  I feel so sick right now.  I think I might not go in to my other work, but damn I need the money.  Shit.  I really don't feel good right now.

      This week, or more specifically the last two days, have completed the week from hell.  I am looking forward to this weekend so much, I think I'm going to leave work today at 2.  I am frustrated and tired and in need of relaxation and hanging out with my boy =)  I won't go into details here on what went on (mainly cuz it'll have a bunch of cuss words and probably won't make much sense cuz I'll be ranting (like that never happens) - basically the week just sucked.    Thanx to everyone who has called me the past few days to congratulate me on SF.  Is there like an underground communication system that I'm not aware of? - ppl who I never thought would have known have called, and I feel really loved cuz of that.  So thanks kidz =)  Now I'm off to grab a donut before they're all gone.   mmmmm......donut......

      This seems to be a theme in my life lately:  I got into the MFA Advertising program at the Academy of Art in San Francisco.  I was happy about this, yesterday.  Before I actually talked about how I was going to get there and what I was going to do etc.  Oi.  Before I talked to Deb about not living with her this year (I am so so SO sorry about that sweetie), before I actually thought about how far I would be from everyone that I love.  Moving cross country seems to be a very big deal.  I am going to miss so many people it's insane.  That's the emotional part that's hard.  The physical part is also difficult.  Esp when you don't have a car to take and will probably end up living far from your school.  ugh.  I hate that.  But I got fully financially aided and all that so it won't be so bad, but they don't have assistantships or scholarships for grad students (ugh annoying) so I'm going to owe them my soul when I get out.  How much does it suck that what you want to do costs so much??  So right now I'm looking for an apt close to campus cuz apparently it's cheaper to live off campus than it is to live on campus.  Wow. Shocker.  I think I found a furnished apt with a 6 month lease tho (this is awesome cuz then I don't have to take much at all and if I want to move out after first semester I can).  I'm already sad though and nothing has happened yet. How come timing sometimes really REALLY sucks?

      This is a question I've been asking myself for the past year, but with increasing volume and repetition recently allowing it to reverberate in my head, therefore causing me to want to scream at the top of my lungs on numerous occasions.  Fun.  I wish I had the answer to this question.  I wish that I didn't have to know the answer rigth now (and to all those people who say you don't have to know, well I don't want to spend $40,000 on school and then come to realize what I actually want to do is be a botanist or something.  I also have this feeling that the school loans I'll have to take out won't repay themselves when I realize my true calling of performing rabbit impersonations.  Not many people can move their ears independantly, and I believe I should get paid for that skill in one way or another.)  Anyway, back to the griping. (I also wish I didn't do that as much either).  I want my life to calm down or something.  To decide what it is going to do, and just do it.  (See how I'm absent from this process?)    This weekend was so nice cuz I actually forgot about all of this stuff for awhile and just got to hang out and get completely wasted.  There's nothing like drinking with friends down at school when you want to forget about something back home.  Ask yourself this question tho and let me know what your answer is.  I'm curious as to what other people want to do.  And don't be annoying and say you want to take over the world.  There are enough Brain's out there (myself included).  I'm talking about the immediate future.  And don't be vague and simply say, "graduate and get a job" cuz that's everyone's plan.  Get a job where, in what, for how long, where do you want to end up at that job, where do u want to live, work, breathe, etc.  Lots o questions.  Gimme some answers people.

      I dunno, but the University of Florida sure wants me to be!!  I got an acceptance letter from them today =)  This is insane.  UFL has the 3rd best Advertising program in the country.  U of Texas is No. 1 (they rejected my ass pretty quickly), U of IL is No. 2 (didn't apply there, I've had enough of central IL thank-you-very-much), U of FL is No. 3 (they evidently want me), and U of MI is No.4 (eww who wants to live in Michigan? sorry Angela).  Wow.  Still reeling.  They're program is really, really good.  The professors are amazing and the research down there is known throughout the world.  It's a huge honor that they want me.  Wow.  Yeah.  wow.    If I go there I can go wakeboarding with Timmy all year round (this would be a plus if I liked water) and have a year round tan (this would also be a plus if I wasn't already kinda brown).    I can't believe I got in.  No really, like shit-on-me I got in?! No frickin way!!  Wow. Still reeling.

      Where did summer go??  There's only 7 more weeks till I leave (to go to Boston, San Francisco, or to move in with Debs).  When the hell did that happen? Usually I start the summer off loving it, cuz there's no homework and I'm not running around all day trying to get everything done and get to meetings etc.  Then after working for about a month I start to miss school, I miss my friends, generally I start to feel a little school-sick.  Then comes the trudging through the next few weeks feeling incredibly tired and bored cuz home sucks and no one lives here anymore, all of my friends live at least 20 mins away, and I have no money cuz I've been paying off all of the credit card debt that I incurred over the school year.  Then comes Aug and you start to get everything ready for school and you count the days till you get to stop working and have time to hang out with your friends who now live 5 mins tops away from you.  This is the normal cycle.  This year the cycle has been disrupted and I seemed to have missed the weeks of trudging.  Granted, home has not been all merry this year but it doesn't seem so dead-ended.  I've had my share of freak outs too (as many of you can attest to) and the indecision is still there, but at least I have options now.  Options are good.  Summer is flying by and I feel as if I cannot slow it down.  It's a little scary, but at the same time I feel tons better about my situation than I have in a long time.

      Finally.  My stupid portfolio is finished.  It's going out in the mail today and then I just have to wait and see.  I disappointed a few people this weekend in order to get this thing done, and I am extremely sorry to both of you. On the up side, I don't have to do it anymore so no more bitching from me =)  Small update: I got an assistantship from Emerson (based on my academic merit hehehe), but it doesn't pay as much as I thought it would. Hmmm. So now I wait for the Academy of Art to get back to me and if I get rejected from there, Boston here I come! If not, then I have an awfully big decision to make in less than a month. Eeek.  btw did anyone know that Kinkos is  hella  expensive??  I dropped over 80 bux there last night. ugh.

      Today I am the latter.  I've been here at  urlLink Millward Brown  since 730am and have accomplished nothing.  Cuz no one is here!!  I have three bosses and they are all gone.  Plus there are 4 other people who randomly give me work who are also all gone.  It's like the Twilight Zone or something.  If I'm gonna waste my time I'd rather be doing it at  urlLink Fujisawa  where I actually get paid for being there.  Grrr to pointless jobs that you initially wanted, but don't anymore, and have to keep for your resume.

      This is way cool - if you don't know =)   urlLink Emerson College  is a communication and arts school in Boston that is hella cool (and hella expensive - $26,000/yr tuition only).  This school was my number one choice last year when I was applying to grad schools.  It is a huge, HUGE ego boost that they accepted me.  The program I got into is their  urlLink Integrated Marketing Communications Program - Creative Track  - this was exactly what I was looking for a year ago.  That's the problem tho.  I'm not sure if this is still what I want.  Don't get me wrong, I am ecstatic that I got into Emerson (I've wanted to go there since last summer) but I'm really thinking about it cuz it's soooo much money and I'm not guaranteed a high-paying job when I get out AND unfortunately I do not have $26,000.  So basically I need to find out how much money they will give me.  Best case senario: they have assistantships left and I get one that pays for almost all of my education.  Most likely senario: I will have to pay a good amount and I can't.  This path leads to deferment.  In fact I think that might be the way I end up going - especially if it will allow me to get an assistantship for next year (cuz it's so late for this year) and allow me to decide if I really want to incur such a huge amount of debt.  Ugh.   Overall: Happy that I got in, but going is quite complicated.

      yet, not in the work that I'm currently supposed to be doing.  Today at MB they had nothing for me to do (I think everyone was recovering from the long weekend) so I ended up writing all of the copy for all of the ads that I still needed to complete.  I rock.  I was blocked last Sunday, and this Sunday I was just so tired and I didn't want to work on it at all.  There's something about just being at work that makes me do work sometimes - even if it's not the work I'm getting paid (or in MB's case not paid) to do.  I'm kind of excited abt finishing it.  Cuz now all I have to do is do the stupid graphic work and then I'm done.  (I only said "stupid graphic work" cuz I suck at it and it takes me quite awhile to do things sometimes, not that I think graphic artists suck - quite the contrary actually.  If you saw my use of Paint you'd understand - it's just sad).

For the people who have to work mon-fri every week of their lives, I feel such pity and sympathy for your life.  I don't want to be you anymore. I want to go play again.

This means a few things:  I will not be as bored, I can check my email without being all sneaky like in the Submissions room, and there will be many more posts on here throughout the rest of the summer.  (Till they realize what we've done and block me or something - but let's hope that doesn't happen).  Today gets a smile.  Now I'm off to go play =)

      I got the job at CDW so I'm leaving here today (thank god).  I'll miss Scott and our incessant coffee runs, but that's about it.  This new job is probably going to suck just as much, if not more, but at least it's in the mktg dept of a Fortune 500 company...and I won't be here.  (I kind of don't like it here if you haven't figured that out yet).  Anyway, tonight I get to visit with friends down at Purdue which should be a nice relaxing vacation full of reading and alcohol, and alcoholic reading.  Yeah.  And now onto the last CRF report that I will have to mess around with in Acrobat. **does crazy-last-Acrobat-CRF dance**  (and smiles)

      Today is the day before my last day at work....or so I thought.  They offered me a position to stay yesterday.  I really wasn't expecting this.  And when my boss made the offer, she apologized for the events that transposed on last Friday (If you don't know what happened, just ask) and told me not to pay attention to Cheryl.  I don't want to work here.  The work is boring and the people suck - exception: Scott.  I have an interview today for an administrative position in the marketing dept of CDW. Ooh someone pinch me I think I'm dreaming.  (sarcasm)  I didn't think I went to school for four years and got a degree to be a frickin secretary.  Christ.  But it'll be better than here if I get it, and I'll be around younger people (this is a huge plus - the average age of workers at Fujisawa is 35-40) but basically, I don't want that job either.  Yeah I know, I'm being picky.  Yeah, I know I can't really afford to be picky.  The CDW job (which btw really REALLY sucks cuz I was thinking of applying for a position in their sales dept that I'm qualified for, but now I'm interviewing for a administrative assistant position?! sorry, not so happy about that) was supposed to be a 5 min phone interview and then a real interview if they liked me, but they loved my resume that they got YESTERDAY and wanted to meet me asap.  Well duh, I'm a little over-qualified for the position dontcha think?  Anyway, money is money as of late, and I will not be keeping that job (if I get it) for the year I'm taking off from school.  The only thing that really sucks is that I wanted to work downtown and CDW is in Vernon Hills which is far from downtown (as well as my home).  I hate jobs.  And I found out last night that Paul is leaving to go back and live in Champaign.  WTF?!  1. Waaay jealous cuz I'd love to do that.  2.  How can you leave us here all alone?? (us namely Ruth and I, but still) and 3.  You just got here and you're already leaving.  *sniff sniff*  yeah, you should feel guilty.  The only semi-promising thing that I am excited about is this meeting that I have with a friend of a former boss who is gonna help me hit up jobs in pharmaceutical advertising agencies.  Granted, I don't want to do that either, but agency work is agency work and I'm basically groomed for pharm adv.  I would DEF, HANDS DOWN, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT rather be doing that downtown than working here or at CDW.  But for now, that's all I've got.  At least I'll have money coming in no matter what - that's the good thing about all of this I guess.  I can't wait for my mini-vacation to Purdue.  I miss you kids!!  I went to BandN last night to get some books to read when I'm there and spent over 80 bux - I love bookstores.  They have so many things that I want to read, they're just so dang expensive.  *sigh*  Now I must get to work.  Hopefully this will all end sooner than I expect.

Today is Friday, I get to leave this stupid job on Wed of next week (only 3 more days!!), following that I get to spend a significant chunk of time with my boy where neither of us have to get anything done or have to be anywhere (this never EVER happens), I was just told about a position in the marketing dept of a company that starts on Sept 2nd that my staffing agency wants to send me on, it is gorgeous outside, and today is Lyd's birthday!!  All around, this is a great day. Smile!

      Alright, so maybe this doesn't apply to you.  Maybe you're one of those ppl who gets up at 4 in the afternoon, eats something, then goes back into hibernation till it's time to go out.  I envy you greatly, and personally I think you should die, but nevertheless  I  am def lacking sleep.  This past weekend was fun, but man I wish I had been able to get more sleep.  I'm a perpetual yawning machine at work today.  Speaking of work, if anyone knows where I can make a decent living (meaning the lowest I'd go would be $12/hr before I suck it up and go work at the mall) please let me know cuz my job at Fujisawa ends on the 27th and as of right now I do not have any other work set up.  A little reflection is going on right now as all of my friends who are still in school get ready to go back, and the ones who aren't are panicking like me cuz none of us have jobs (exception: Devon and Rupal) and student loans payments are quickly approaching.  I remember being jealous of my friends who had graduated and didn't have to go through more papers and tests or pull any more all-nighters trying to get everything done in time (the lucky ones I thought) and now that I'm a "lucky one" I've come to realize that we're not that lucky.  I'd rather be in school right now - hanging out with my friends and cramming papers and tests in on the side - not fighting this horrible economy trying to find a job where I won't have to ask "Want fries with that?"  To be honest, for as much stress that this summer has had with grad school plans, I'm glad that I'm not going anywhere just yet.  The whole process was so rushed.  And the money that you borrow in loans doesn't seem real till you figure out what your payments will be when you get out (and then compare that to what you will most likely be making - then after you pass out from shock you realize that you might have to rethink this whole grad school thing). Speaking of grad school (the guy on the radio kept doing that "speaking of" thing this morning and I think it became contagious) I can't apply to Miami Ad School till 2005.  Long complicated story, but basically I wouldn't be able to get the FASFA loans that I would need till then because of their stupid rules.  Anyway, so the plan has been altered yet again.  Now it looks like I'll be applying only to VCU for next fall and if I do not get in there then I'm off to U of FL.  After U of FL who the hell knows, but at least there is a plan that I like now.    Ok, so I know a lot of you are wondering what the hell is going on and why I didn't just go to SF.  Basically, I figured out that the program would not do for me in the industry what I thought it would have. (Yeah I know I should have found that out sooner, but I'm a procrastinator).  It was that coupled with the fact that I would have to borrow at LEAST $18,500 /yr for 3 years and work at LEAST 30 hours a week in order to make it by monetarily.  Rent is expensive in SF.  I think they even charge you to take a leak in a public restroom.  Swear to god.  So that bascially just sucked monkey balls.  I figured out that I would have to pay so much money for a degree that wouldn't give me the same amount back (At least not in 10 years which is the cut-off date for my loan repayment).  For some reason MFAs don't have as high a starting salary as JDs yet this school costs around the same.  Funny how the world works like that.  Anyway, and the reason I am not going to FL this fall is cuz 1. Too soon - school starts next week for christ sake. 2. I had applied past the fellowship/assistantship deadline so I wasn't considered for any aid other than loans, and I'm going to reapply for fellowships and assistantships for next fall in February. 3.  It's the most affordable. And 4. It just happens to be the best advertising program that I got into.  (Neat little coincidence there).    Now onto the question many ppl have asked me:  Why didn't you just apply to VCU last year when you applied to all the other schools?  Answer: cuz I'm chicken.  I didn't think I would get in at all so I didn't even apply.  They only take 60 people per year, and only 20 for what I want to do.  So basically, competition is extremely fierce and I didn't think I would cut it so I didn't make the effort.  Yes, I know that was stupid.  Yes, I am kicking myself now.  Especially cuz I got into U of FL and I DEF wasn't supposed to get in there.  So now I figure, I should at least try to get in to VCU, and if I don't make it I have a hell of a program to fall back on.  I've been told by a very wise person that it's a good idea to have a back-up plan. (Just don't say I-told-you-so or I'll punch you in the face). *smooches*  Anyway, this got long and I think I best get some work done before they fire my ass and I don't have a job till next week after all.  Toodles.

      Nothing much to say as of late.  I'm basically now looking for any type of work that I can do till I get my other applications in to VCU and Miami Ad School.  The plan is that if I get rejected from them then I'm headed to U of FL next fall.  That's the plan this week.  The plan seems to change quite often tho, so pardon me if I do not keep this updated enough.  Still at work.  Stupid submission was SUPPOSED to be submitted today, but now it looks like it won't be cuz we still need this one guy to sign it and he's a pain-in-the-butt to deal with.  Fun.  Oh god, I have work related stress.  How annoying.  I'm getting tired of lots of things lately.  I kind of just want a fresh start somewhere away from all of this, and then I know that I'd miss everything too much.  I really miss Ira right now tho.  I hate that your law school is so freakin far from Chicago girl!!  I need you.  Speaking of needing people, when the hell are you coming home Paul?? Seriously.  Home is sucking and I need you to come and make it bearable.  And Wanj I'm sorry, but you need to visit more cuz this seeing you once every 8 months just isn't going to cut it for me.  Oh and Ru, if you can't think of anything to get me from Italy or Spain it's ok - just send a postcard of some hot european kid and all will be forgiven =)  I think that takes care of the bitching to my friends bit.  And now I'm off to see if this stupid submission is going out or not.  We only have till 6 - what do you think is going to happen?

      why is it that sometimes the smallest thing can make you feel like you've just been run over by a freight train.  Sometimes, especially lately, I want to fast forward 5 years and just go from there.  Everything would be figured out and I would simply be living my life.  Doing my thing (whatever that may be).  Anyway, if you don't know already I'm not going to SF anymore.  Yeah, I know - last minute change.  I'm not going to go into detail here but it seems like I'm going to be in Chicago for a bit.  At first I was pissed cuz I felt like I had no options, and now I'm mad cuz I feel like I have too many and I don't know what to do.  University of Florida - this is where I would go to get my masters in advertising.  Problem is I need a portfolio too and I don't get that from UofFL so I'd have to go to more schooling afterwards. (bonus: the program is a year and a half long) Solving this problem would be to go to Virginia Commonwealth University AdCenter - they offer a joint masters/portfolio program.  Problem there is their acceptance rate is less than 30% and steadily decreasing.  Not a good sign.  And I've already missed the deadline for this year (obviously) but they start accepting applications for next year in October so if I applied I would hear back pretty soon.  I didn't apply here at all cuz I thought I wouldn't get in - I probably still won't but what the hell - I guess I'll try. Maybe. Miami Ad School is another portfolio school that gives a masters degree with Florida International University.  This program is a year and a half, which is awesome, and you get to spend part of it abroad if you want (also awesome) but what the hell is FIU? I've never heard of the school before and it's not an excellent program for a masters degree in mass comm - plus you have to pay tuition at both schools - yeah that sucks.  Basically there are still things I want to look into and I also feel like I'm constantly spinning my wheels.  Why can't I just make a freakin decision and stick to it?

      I feel like kind of an ass right now cuz as much as I hated going to this job cuz it was so far, and they didn't have a lot of work for me to do, and they never explained how to do anything - they gave me a going away present.  Thoughtful, sweet, and made me feel crummy cuz I lied about why I was leaving so early.  =(  They got me a Barnes and Noble girft card for 40 bux so I could buy a book on SF before I go to school and a book to read on the "vacation" that I'm taking with my family.  See? sweet.  dammit.

      Today is most def not sunny (rainy and gray and cloudy in fact) but I am happy as a clam.  (Are clams really happy? Who even determined this?)  Anyway, I made amends with a really old friend last night.  We've had our ups and downs during the past years, but I'm really glad that we talked and that we now know where one another stands and we understand why things happened the way they did and I can honestly say that I could hang out with him and not have it be all stressed and annoying-like.  I haven't felt good about that relationship in years and it's nice to know that I can now walk away with no hard feelings on either side and a sense of finality to it all.  But the bigger plus to today is that it's Friday (small yay) and I just found out that I get to see my boy (big yay).  Plus today is my last day here at  urlLink Millward Brown  (even bigger yay). No more 630-730am commutes for me!!  If I could only stop smiling....

      Since I just got that incredibly cool job at  urlLink Euro , I decided to celebrate by buying a car.  Seriously.  Well, maybe not to celebrate, but my car was 13 yrs old - I needed a new one badly.  So I got myself a 2000 Celica GTS.  See  urlLink pic .  I've been running around all day getting financing straightened out, getting it checked by Brian - my mechanic (who ROCKS!!!), making an appt to get my stereo system switched out and put in the new car (the GTS is the upgraded model and the sound still sucks - wtf), and going to city hall to get a sticker and what not.  Ugh.  Getting a new car is SO much work.  BUT the coolest thing is I allowed 300 for car payments in my newly made budget and my payments ended up being $298.30.  Kick ass.  So everythings working out.  Plus, and this is a lil weird, my dad decided to buy the old car for $2,800.  That's insane.  I thought we'd be lucky to get 2000 for it.  BB value is 2750 so it's pretty good.  Plus he's paying in installments so it works for him - all in all a good deal for everyone involved.  Bad thing tho, my insurance DOUBLED.  That sucks monkey balls.  Price you pay I guess, but dang.  I'm exhausted right now and it's raining so I'm gonna go take a nap.  Toodles.

      I got offered the position this afternoon!  I was shaking.  Literally shaking.  I'm a lot calmer now than I was then, but that has to do with a lot of conversations that I had with some people over certain issues that will remain unsaid.  I am currently happy again tho (yay!)  and am celebrating tonight with Ruth and Paul.  Anyone who wants to come out with us please do - just give any one of us a call.  I start on Monday.  Insane.    I still can't believe I got it.  I rock.  Undeniably, I rock.  (has anyone seen my boyfriend? I can't seem to get ahold of the buttmunch)

      I remember  urlLink this ad , but I had no clue how much it had helped Sting, or that it was his manager's idea.  The pairing of a music artist and a product has happened before (and done badly: think Enrique Iglesias and Doritos - bah) but I had liked this one, and apparently I wasn't alone.  Granted I don't have the money to buy a Jaguar, nor am I a fan of Sting to much extent, but I did rather enjoy the ad and the article brings about the great idea for the music industry to use the resources of major companies to promote their artists.  Quit blaming poor kidz for stealing your money by piracy (which will always exist no matter how hard you try) and think of new possibilities of how you could try to regain some revenue.  Then again, having cpg companies foot the bill is kind of a larger, more literal way of selling out.  mmm interesting.....  But does anyone think that artists who sign to a major label (who would be the only ones able to make these deals anyway) would mind?  I didn't think so either.    What is scary is that although this couple worked well, people have not seemed to take it a step further at all.  Celine Dion paired with Chrysler recently in an ad; having her drive the car while her music is playing and simultaneously singing along.  Again, not a huge fan of Celine either but I felt that the Sting&Jaguar couple fared better than the C&C music factory production.  Copying someone else's successful idea doesn't make your product successful as well, in fact it makes you look like a cheap copycat who isn't smart enough to come up with their own shit.  (bullet-time commercials anyone?)  Although I think that these commercials bring up an interesting idea, if not done well they could easily become like the OTC ad fad and end up being the butt of many jokes.  (Enrique, why don't you come on over tonight and eat some of my Doritos......*growl*;  I've got the best Doritos in town baby!!; etc)  Don't you love how advertising affects society?  Or is it just me.

      Kinda sleepy today.  Went to bed at 10, but still kinda tired.  Waiting on Euro as well doesn't really help with the sleep factor.  Hopefully I will find out soon, but I'm told that sometimes it takes FOREVER to let ppl know whether or not they got a job.  I think it might even be inevitable that I will start at Performics.  This is not so bad, but I wish I would know if it was for good or if it was just until I heard from Euro, ya know?  The waiting kinda kills.    Going down to U of I this weekend (who hoo!) so that should be fun.  mmm tired.  I want to go back to my warm snuggly bed right now and hang out with pooh bear and read.  Yes, that sounds so perfect right now....mmmm pooh....

      That's my new phone number.  Learn it, use it, love it.  (props to Illie for that phrase) I will be changing my VM on my old phone to tell people of the new number, but after Oct 1st my old phone won't work.  In fact, I think I might forward all calls from my old phone to my new one, except then you people don't realize that my number has changed.  Oh well.  I need to keep the old number for awhile cuz all of my business contacts have that number, but sometime next week I'll just be forwarding all calls to the new number.  Confused yet?  Yeah, me too.  Bottom line: I got a new number.  Update your shit.

      You'll never guess who just called.  Guess.  Fuck you no.   urlLink Euro RSCG  called!!!  I have a second interview on Friday of this week!!!! I thought I completely BOMBED the interview I had last week.  Seriously.  Bombed.  Like starving-children-drinking-radioactive-water type of wreckage.  I was crying before I had even gotten to the corner of the street.  How in the world I have a second interview I'm amazed.  Well, I know I rock, but I was completely sure that the lady who interviewed me didn't think I did.  I usually charm my way into their hearts at some point, but she stayed cold and unforgiving and I felt like I completely fucked up.  She didn't like that I just got out of school.  She didn't like that I couldn't pick a favorite brand quickly, or determine their target audience and why, and their competitors' target audiences and why, and the overall theme of the brand and the themes of its competitors and taking everything I said into consideration make up a commercial that fits into the paradigm I have created for the brand and its competitors where the key qualities that make my brand different from the others stand out while reinforcing the general qualities that help define my brand in the marketplace without alluding to any of the other brands key qualities that I believe make them different from my brand.  Yeah.  That interview was FUCKING hard.  And I got a second.  INSANE!!!!!!!!  Wow, I'm still reeling.  I was so crushed by this interview.  I was convinced that I was going to have to enter advertising from another way since the direct way didn't seem to be working.  Wow.  Well even if this doesn't go any further, I am happy that I got a callback - if anything this makes me realize that I have no idea how my interviews go at all and perhaps the world is full of dumb luck.  Then again, maybe I just rock.

       urlLink Performics  called me during lunch to tell me that they are going to match my pay! This is great cuz I was going to take a cut in pay by taking that job, but now I don't have to =)  The HR lady talked to the VP of the department and the CFO (wha?? insane!!) to ask them their opinions and it turns out that they really want me to come work there, so they are going to match what I make now (how cool!)  I rock.  Happy lil bdays to Bridget out in sunny Cali (no sweat-ter weather there I bet) =)  I'm gonna transfer my cell phone to Sprint by the end of the month.  (I'm sorry Ranjit, will you still be my friend? *makes puppy eyes*)  I'll try to get ahold of as many of you as I can, and I'll also post my new number on here.  They have a kickass deal right now for regional people (IL, IN, WI) - 1,000 anytime for 40 bux a month (extras cost extra of course) - it's cool for me cuz I save money on this plan and get more anytime mins, plus I get to call you for free Ira! No more .40/min charges for me =) - tho come to think of it I probly won't be using as many daytime mins anymore cuz I'll be working....meh, it's costing about the same as I pay now so no biggie =)  No other news; everything looks quiet on the western front.

      Today I am wearing a sweater at work.  A sweater. Sweat. Ter.  As you can see, I am disturbed by this, esp seeing as it should not be sweater weather yet.  No no no.  I refuse to accept sweater weather yet.  The redeeming quality of today is that they have those big smiley face cookies with the free bagels this morning.  I love smiley face cookies.  It almost makes the sweater-weather bearable.  Almost.

      I told my manager today that I'm leaving on the 25th (yes, it's a Thursday - I want a lil 3-day-vaca before I start my new job at  urlLink Performics ) and ironically I got an email today that says my job will be replaced by a computer program by the end of October.  So I guess it's best, tho I fell a bit bad that I won't be here till then cuz they will have to have someone else come in and they will only get to be here till then - unless they decide to give my replacement more responsibility, which I doubt.  They were too cheap to hire someone to do this work so I highly doubt they will make more work for whoever comes after me.  Anyway, kudos to me on the new job - KUDOS.  mmmm kudos....  So now I have only 9 days left here which is so weird cuz I've only worked at  urlLink CDW  since the 2nd.  Should you put a job that you've worked at for a little less than a month on your resume?  Yeah, I don't think so either.  Anyway, back to the illustrious job of faxing.

      I disliked the new McDonald ads when they first came out - announcing publicly that I thought they were dumb, unsuccessfully trying to gain a younger audience, and attempting to be "hip" but failing miserably.   urlLink This guy  not only agrees with me, but takes it to a new level: connecting it to rave culture??  That is a bit to much I think.  But the ads still suck.

      At my old work I had tons of time to think, play on the internet, and generally waste time cuz pharmaceutical companies don't exactly move at the speed of light. (Ex: it takes a little over 10 years for a drug to go from discovery to the open market).  I know that the job I currently have isn't exactly rocket science (hell it isn't even science at all) but it did keep me busy - but apparently that was yesterday cuz today I've had only two folders all morning and my Inbox (yes, I have an Inbox) has been empty for the past 3 hours.  This, compared to yesterday when I had tons of work to do and my Inbox was never empty, is weird.  I have to learn to waste time again, so as you know that means: more posts. (small cheer)   I have my interviews tomorrow and to be honest, I am sufficently scared.  A job at Euro could mean a lot, so of course I'm getting a little nervous.  Nightly drives have been a normal occurance this week.  I'm apprehensive about tomorrow, cept I know that I don't know nervous till I get to the place and I'm in the waiting room.  oi.  I'm currently waiting for Paul to get here so we can grab some Panera (yum!)  Cool thing I just found out too: Rob works at CDW =)  We'll probly get lunch one day next week or something.  But now, my tummy grumbles as I wait for Paul to get here....*grumble grumble*

      Sorry I haven't written for awhile - things have been kind of hectic.  I started at  urlLink CDW  last week, in my resume I describe the job as:  "Associate Advertising Production Coordinator, CDW, Vernon Hills, IL  September 2003-Present. Marketing department.  Working with media and product specialists to achieve accurate and complete catalog ad placements with vendors from around the country.  Using Excel and FilemakerPro extensively, I communicate with vendors for the company concerning their approval of advertising in CDW catalogs." But all I really do is fax all day. Fun huh? Today was actually pretty crazy - we had an acquisition announced today and the day was filled with meetings and spontaneous projects not allowing me to get my actual work accomplished.  No worries tho, it's waiting for me when I go back there tomorrow.   As for good work-related developments (sorry ranjit but that's all that's been going on lately) I have two interviews on Thursday.  One at  urlLink Performics  and the other at  urlLink Euro RSCG  (omg!!).  Hopefully all will go well.  For now Im hanging tight and seeing how things pan out.  Shout outs to Ru, Wanj, Paulie, Dev, and Lyd - post-college life is def better with you kidz around. *hugz*

      At least that's what my fortune cookie says.  (we have this great Chinese place a block and a half from work, but I digress)  This "fortune" is one that I would normally laugh at and think would be funny, but last night my mom sat my brother and I down for the routine "If I should die...." talk.  Now I've had these talks pretty frequently growing up (I think that comes from being a single parent raising two small children) and I've had my share of fights as to who gets what when mom dies (yeah well I'm sure your family wasn't normal either).  But this time it was just sad.  She's going on a business trip to Japan for a week (party at my house next week - w00t!!) and she had just gone and redone her will yesterday.  Scary shit.  When I was little I was scared of these talks at first, but then they just became routine every time my mom would leave on business (which was hella often), but this time she was very certain about what she wanted us to do: with her body, with the assets, with the compensation we would get from her company.  She insisted that the money be used towards something productive.  My brother was to buy realestate and I was to pay for grad school.  This "compensation" is a HELL of a lot of money I found out - abt 3 times my mom's wages (which ain't too shabby by themselves).  This made me feel very awkward and uncomfortable.  I felt as if I couldn't do anything with that money - it's death money.  ugh.  (I pretty much didn't want to think about it.)  Then she made me PROMISE that I would use it for grad school, and if there was money left over I was to buy a condo.  Why do we always have to have these stupid conversations??  They make me so goddang sad now.  When I didn't have to think about it I was fine.  Knowing exactly what is going to happen and what I'm supposed to do (where my mom wants to be buried, what she wants her headstone to look like) - it's a little unnerving, and I want to be little again.  I want to think that this is all part of the routine and that my mom will never die - that she can't, she'd never let death get her - she's too feisty.  Bottom line:  I hate reality.

      Went to visit U of I this weekend.  Lots happened, had tons of fun, missed being a college kid.  I miss my party friends more than I thought I did, and I missed my good friends even more.  This led me to visit Elliot's old column (my gangster film ta and overall good friend). His last column made me sad, yet there's not much else to do now.  Work is work (and work sucks btw) and today I downloaded the application to VCU.  Ha.  We'll see how far I get with that.  UFL is still an option - a viable one - and unless I begin to love this job it might be one I'm checking out more than I thought I would.  Basically, today is a day of missing and reflection it seems.  Def not work conducive.    In unrelated news, I miss my pooh bear.  That is all.

      and I am happy.  You never really realize how much you miss Ding-dongs till you have one again.  mmmm...yummy.  Today has been "okay".  Basically meaning, I have not been yelled at in an unfair fashion yet.  I say yet because it's only 2 and there are still many hours left in the day.  Ding-dongs rock tho.  (Sorry there's two in a pack.)  I have been slowly making it through the days here.  It's weird because as I am learning and I want to be good at this, I am also coming to the conclusion that I might very likely be going to U of FL next fall.  Depending on how much I want to keep this job / find another.  In other news, my brother just received his diploma.  Yesterday.  Mind you my brother is 2 yrs older than me and was in school for 5 yrs.  His diploma is dated June 16th, 2003.  This offically makes me the first college grad in the kids in my family (granted there aren't a lot of kids but what the hell).  That's a little weird, but I'm glad he FINALLY has the damn thing.  Lazy, underachieving people are not my favorite people to try and work with.  And yes, family life is work.  Trust me.  Other news:  we now have hot water again.  Our hot water heater broke this weekend and we have been taking cold showers since sunday.  Well, I've been taking them every other day.  It's DAMN cold and I can only suffer so much.  Besides, girls don't smell.  (Brian, do not fight me on that.)  I'm trying to keep happy, but lately there are a lot of things that make me a bit sad.  I'm fine, no worries, I just wish sometimes that things in my life were different, ya know? (yeah like none of you know how that feels.)  Quote from outside cool-as-hell source that won't allow me to post on here: "believe we should believe in something we don't know for sure acknowledge the range of possibilities  unlimited by what we see move reality with imagination  we decide what our destinies will be." ~staceyann chin

      Thank god.  I still got yelled at, but this time she realized that her direction wasn't clear enough after she finished yelling.   And  she actually asked me if she had answered a question I asked her after she rambled a bit but didn't answer it!  Yay =)  I think progress is happening.    And even though I'm having such trouble with some people, my director is awesome.  He's always encouraging and supportive of me, and I really feel as if he's in my corner.  I love that.  Plus he makes me feel like everyone who works here isn't a flaming bitch.  Remind me to tell you of my yelling-obscenities-over-rows-of-cubicles story that occurred this morning.  *shudder*  Also, I googled Rupal cuz I was told not to and found this iiiinteresting  urlLink page .  hehehe  Love ya Ru!!

      I have just had the most STRESSFUL day.  Full of ups and downs and freak-outs and lectures and tears and frustration and anything else you can think of to make the day more crappy.  My god.  I swear I've never had a job like this EVER.  I don't know if I'm up for it.  These people are INSANE!!  And EVERYONE seems to have a different way of doing things as well as the gusto to tell you that you're doing it wrong.  Plus the fact that there are like 9 different processes all going on at the same time and I only know snippets of each one and I keep getting questions thrown at me that I can't answer.  I don't think I've ever had a job this hard.  Who ever said advertising was fun - I wanna get to the fun part, when does the fun part come?  After you feel like dying???  I wanna go home.  And I don't think I can =(  I hate this.  The dubs aren't going to go out today and there's nothing I can do about except make a list of things I need to double-check the status on on Monday.  Plus I just got yelled at by an old woman who works in traffic - that was not pleasant.  It totally reminded me of 3rd grade and the teacher I had then yelling at me.  Yes I cried.  Gratefully I could close the door to my office, but I def cried at work.  This is insane.  Speaking of offices, we're all moving soon to accommodate 150 people from another division in Chicago,  urlLink Brann .  This means I will be losing my office (sadness) but hopefully (and my fingers are SO crossed on this) I will get to share an office with another AAE so I can bounce questions and concerns off of them so I don't feel like a goddang idiot every time I have to ask Vickey or Becky a question.  It is not fun when Vickey looks at you like "why are you asking me this?" all over her face.  I want to go home but I can't cuz I have to wait to talk to Vickey to see what's going on with the client (what she told them or what I have to tell them) and if the revs are going to be fixed by Monday.   I want to go home.  Badly.    And I desperately need a hug right now.  =(

       - If I had a quarter for every meeting I've had this week I could ride the train for free every day.  - I had a meeting with a lady from Traffic today who has a kid who goes to Gemini Junior High and I'm an idiot so I tell her about how I used to go to East Prairie and we would compete with Gemini in Battle of the Books competitions.  If you don't know what BOTB is, then you were not as much of a nerd as I was in junior high.  (Ruth you were SO sitting right next to me so don't even THINK of trying to act like you don't know what I'm talking about.)  - I saw a really nice thing at lunch today:  A pretty cute filipino guy bought lunch for this homeless man.  The situation: Scary? a little.  Sweet? you bet.  - I really think that sometimes I just miss the annoyingly-obvious things:  Chicago's football team is the Bears, and its baseball team are the Cubs.  That's annoyingly cute.

      I JUST got an email from  urlLink Bernard Hodes Group  asking me to come in for an interview.  I had sent them a resume close to two months ago.  This interview is for the SAME job I had applied to then.  People are insane.

      Jason (kid at work) went to the game last night.  Needless to say it wasn't the best time he ever had, but he did get a photo-op with Eddie Vedder.  Weird! Cuz I didn't even recognize him at all in the photo.  He was at Murphy's - which is kickass, but he def looks weirder than I remember - looks kinda like Kato actually (scary I kno!!)

      1.  It smells like chocolate outside.  This is not a good thing as one might imagine.  It is actually pretty nauseating.   2.  I like to be at work when no one is here and I'm free to get my shit done and ask questions if I need help, not because I feel like I should - and I esp love that no one bothers me.  I am left to my own devices and am doing just fine thank you. 3.  I have not had a cigg in a week today.  (Smoking while drinking does not count.)  -- Do not congratulate me on this.  I just want to see if the not smoking fits into my life as of now.  Plus the ppl who smoke at work all talk funny - raspy and stuff - I don't want to talk like that. 4.  The more I talk to planners the more it seems a good fit for me.  That both excites and scares me. 5.  I miss security.  I miss being able to say, "I kick ass at blank, blank, and blank" and being certain that I was going to be great.   6.  I am now def more reserved than before.  I'm beginning to long for a time when I felt more "at home" with myself.  The solace that I have found lately exists only in old friends and the people I've grown to love and care about deeply.  I remember a time when I felt safe and protected...too bad I was only 4 - I might be able to remember more if I had ever had that when I was older. 7.  I wish that the Cubs had won yesterday so I could go dance my butt off to some DnB.  Instead I will be at Champs tonight, drinkin some Corona with Paul and watching them win.

      as much.  =)  I found out what I want to be (I think).  From what I've heard and from what I've read, I would be perfect as an Account Planner.    "Account Planning  the art of knowing how to speak to people in a way that moves them. It is for the deeply curious who wonder how everything ticks, that love culture and the forms of communications that work with consumers. It also requires a passion for the creative product, for it is a planners insights that serve as a roadmap for creating an ad. They inform the thinking behind the ads."  It melds account management (which I am beginning to think I really suck at - which I also told myself before I even graduated, so I knew even then) and the creative side of adv (which has no job security and pays low, but is hella fun and something I would love).  I needed something inbetween I guess, and this seems like a good choice.    We will see tho, as I have changed my mind on so many different things this past year, but I am def happy that this job doesn't seem like the dark endless tunnel of crap that it seemed yesterday.    Tomorrow is another day.

      Or something to that effect.  I need to think up some skills on how to deal with people here - it's getting to be problematic, in the sense that I'm losing my sanity and that's a problem.   I just spent almost the entire day working on a statistical analysis for my manager and when I came to her to ask how detailed she wanted the graphs done, she looked at me and said: "what else should you be working on?"  I just stared.  I had spent this whole morning trying to get the data ready for her to present at the 3pm new business meeting.  I had *thought* that was more impt than anything else I had going on, but apparently I was wrong.  She lectured me on how I had let my supervisor leave without reminding her that she had to give me an example of this POV that I'm supposed to do by the end of the week, and that I really need to be more "on the ball".  wtf.  No offense lady, but you ASKED me to help you get this done before the meeting and I had checked with my supervisor to see if it would be okay for me to help you instead of working on my other crap, and now it was all for nothing cuz you just basically yelled at me for not doing my other stuff.  I don't understand this.  It's so dang frustrating!!    I do not like the corporate world.

      I know, I know.  I raved about my work.  Now it's time to gripe about it.  First of all, I hate being thrown into situations without being given any direction whatsoever and expected to "sink or swim".  That's bullshit.  Give me SOMETHING to go on please - I don't think that's too much to ask.   And I don't care if you want to see how I do - give me some direction so I don't have to redo the thing ten million times, or look like a complete moron to other people when I have to go ask them for things that I have no clue as to why I am asking them.  Ugh!!  And don't just expect me to know stuff - pretend I am 3 yrs old and all I know is how to tie my shoes and form sentences.  Just pretend.  Then perhaps we will get along better and I won't disappoint you as I seem to be doing.  That is probly the most frustrating thing of all.  I get the feeling like I am not meeting my supervisor's expectations, but how can I if I have no clue as to what I am doing and I am thrown into every situation with a "good luck, let's see what you come up with."    I am beginning to have some frustration with the love of my life.

      Possibly.  Not sure tho.  I recently have had trouble breathing (recently meaning past two-three days).  Originally I was really scared cuz I thought that I smoked too much and my inability to breathe had something to do with that.  When I eventually told my mother because I was scared and had no idea of how I should go about treating this without going to the doctor first, she came up with many motherly suggestions:  I have lung cancer.  I have pneumonia.  I have lung cancer.  I have developed asthma.  I have lung cancer.  (Lung cancer was quite popular) but after much explaining about how I could not possibly have lung cancer from a mere 3 years of light/medium smoking, she decided that I had lung cancer.  It was a great conversation let me tell you.  Esp cuz I was heaving and panting through all of it cuz I couldn't get the breath to yell or anything, so I think my points were ineffective.  Anyway, after talking to a bunch of people and describing the pain to many (as well as it going away a bit last night) I now think that I just strained a muscle in my chest.  Granted that's not exactly a good thing, in fact it hurts like a BITCH, but it's better than say, lung cancer.  The pain has moved to my left shoulder and collarbone area (which also sucks) but I think that's from sleeping on my stomach with my left arm above my head - the only comfy position I could find in the past three nights.  So now I'm looking forward to seeing Ira, she's home for the weekend, and getting some major sleep with my new pal Aleve.

      Rupal - cuz she's been actively looking for an apt for us AND cuz she conceded to Jo's urgings and is taking a Salsa class and loving it! Paul - cuz even tho he hasn't heard a yes from the company yet, he hasn't heard a no either. Stanish - cuz he got an A on his Econ test (and of course for all the other reasons I love the kid) Illie - cuz she's pulling her weight this semester and I know she'll come out on top. Lauryn - cuz she got into the masters accounting program at UofI and will make tons o loot when she gets out (don't forget abt me hon!) Chandni - cuz she is my new lunch buddy down here. My work - cuz I just noticed that on a wall on my floor they have a life-size pixelated art piece made of square leather pieces that form Mario, from Mario and Luigi fame. and the post office lady - cuz she just let me borrow 10 cents =)

      1.  I've noticed that the stairwell in the parking garage at the Howard station smells like summer camp.  I can't explain it, but it makes me smile every time I'm in there. - And no, the smell is not piss, tho I could see how you could think that might be it.    2.  There was a Legolas look-alike on the red line this morning.  Long blonde hair, clear cut jawline, high cheekbones.  And he was dressed like a hippie.  It was odd, yet really cool.  I kept staring as he was drinking his coffee and looking around at the passengers.  I was in awe a little even though I know I was being dumb - Legolas would never dress like a hippie.  3.  It's SUPER nice outside - I picked a hell of a day to stop smoking.

       urlLink How are you viewed by marketers?   I am:  You are an Up & Comer  Up & Comers make up 16% of the U.S. population. Many of them live on their own and lack family obligations. They tend to be self-focused and interested in fun and adventure, though not at the expense of their social consciousness. Ambitious and upbeat, they are extremely enthusiastic about technology and enjoy using (and owning) computers and surfing on the Internet. They feel comfortable with all of the information available today, are open to new ideas, and tend not to be cynical about the modern world.  Up & Comers describe themselves as creative, intelligent, self-confident, and funny. They are definitely not old-fashioned. They are concerned about keeping up with the latest fashions and trends and are extremely active. For fun, they enjoy playing sports, hiking and camping, shopping, spending time with friends, watching television, and attending cultural events.   Finances are not a high priority for Up & Comers. They are not very concerned about planning for their financial future or living within their means. They are more concerned about their personal health and staying in shape. Up & Comers also have a strong need to know themselves better and map out clear life goals as well as get more pleasure out of life.   Up & Comers tend to be single Generation X non-parents.

      I have been running nonstop at this job.  Granted that hasn't been the easiest thing to do, esp with my dang ear not working and hurting on a consistent basis, but I've done it.  Now I can finally take a lil breather and step back from it all.  This job rocks.  No, I mean it really, really rocks.  The place is amazing, I want all of you kidz to come down and visit me at work - the space is incredible.  There are TVs in the walls that play Simpsons every day and when there's a game on they play that - it's ubercool.  And my office is a HUGE plus - I never know how much I would like an office.  I mean, I know I hated cubes, but the alternative wasn't within my reach - ever - so I didn't even dream.  I want to give everyone an office.  But not mine.  I like mine. =)  I've made it through my first week at a top 5 worldwide agency and all I have to say is wow.  It's overwhelming and there is a ton, a TON, of work that I will be in charge of, but I'm really excited about it.  And the best part is that all that stuff I learned in school about advertising applies to my job and actually HELPS me do it better.  Insane huh?  My clients are Summer's Eve and Hillshire Farm.  I actually like working on SE more right now (probly cuz more is going on with them) but I've wowed my bosses a few times with my industry knowledge (yeah, I rock) - my director actually called my memory of an 5 yr old commercial "amazing".  Yeah, I rock.    The funny thing is that even though I left school I still have homework.  My director gave me a book on the industry that he wants me to read and to come to him with any questions I have on it and I have to read an agency orientation and brand review on SE before Monday so I can sit in on the conference call and actually have something relevant to contribute.  Working at a big agency is simultaneously thrilling and scary.  I still can't believe I got this job.  I feel like they are going to surprise me one day and tell me that my time here is over.  It's really an amazing opportunity and I feel like I'm being introduced into this little club of the agency world or something.  And even weirder is that they all think I'm smart - they've actually said that to my face.  It's really weird when something that you think you'd be really great at is finally put in front of you by people who think the same thing and are waiting for you to show your greatness.  My director keeps telling me that he knows I'll accomplish great things here - I'm 22!!!  It's great that he thinks that, but there is def a pressure factor that I'm not sure he realizes he's putting on me.  And I think I just set the record of using the word "great" in a paragraph.  Well, I have to get some more work done before I can leave tonight.  Hopefully I will see some of the Purdue folks later on tonite.    *big breath*    My life is just beginning.

      To an existence where you don't have to pay nearly $300 when your ear breaks.  Fucking sucks.  The meds plus the doctor's fees was about $290.  Insane!!  And to top things off, last night my ear drum perforated.  Yay.  That means that icky ooze came out from my ear and it hurt like HELL cuz the ear drum basically ripped.  Yeah.  Not fun at all.  Another bad thing about today, sorry I'm on a roll, I was late to work cuz there's no parking at the frickin yellow line anymore - there was like 3 years ago when I worked downtown, what the hell happened??  So I had to wait around till someone decided to leave - which totally doesn't happen cuz everyone parks there to get ON the train to LEAVE the parking lot.  Ugh.  Anyway, I also have to take my car in today to Brian to have him check out what the dealer kidz did.  And if he needs to fix more shit I'm SOL cuz I have like NO money.  Right now it's lunch time here but I only have 5 bux and that's not gonna buy me anything good down-frickin-town.  Sorry.  I'm a lil peeved.  Haven't had any ciggs either today.  I think that's what I'll buy with my 5 bux.....hmm the first good idea I've had today besides analyzing feminine hygiene products and sausage products to death.  I will know more about sausages and how women feel about their "downstairs" area than I would ever like to know cuz of this job.  And yes, they call it the "downstairs" area.

Not posting much about job - sorry.  Currently my right ear hurts like hell.  Have an ear infection.  Had to go to the doctor today - my pediatrition mind you, cuz my med stuff is all down at U of I.  Cost me over $150 for meds and visit. Ear hurts.   Want to go home and take advil and sleep.

      Period.  It is my mom's 55th birthday.  She loves the present my brother and I got her.  LOVES.  This never happens.  If you know my mom then you know what I'm talking about.  But she loved it.  And it made me smile all the way to work.  My job doesn't completely blow today.  I'm learning how to massage certain people to get what I need done and by the deadlines.  I'm learning how to schmooze and work around things in order to fix the never ending stream of problems that always seem to pop up.  In short, I'm getting better at it.  I have the best boyfriend in the world.  Nuff said. =)  And to top it all off, I get to leave work at 430 today.  4......30.  Usually I get out of here around 7.  So 430 is unheard of.  I've actually never left that early.  Ever.  (Well except for that time I puked and had to leave at 330, but that's doesn't count cuz I was sick.)  All in all, today is a grand, fine day.

      Finally.  They've been building  urlLink this  since my freshman year.  About time they finished.  Tho to be honest it just enrages me more at the inequality on campus.  Why can't English majors make tons of loot and donate some money so the English building could be updated??  That place is in shambles I tell you, shambles.  I completely agree with  urlLink Anne .  I used to not have an opinion on the chief cuz I didn't want to get into it all, but I've changed my mind in the past years and the mascot is wrong.  I almost don't mind having it left as a symbol so there can be a compromise between pro-chief ppl and anti-chief ppl, but the mascot MUST go.  Cmon guys, it's really not honoring a heritage when it's fake: a white guy dressed up as a Native American prancing around at games (and I do mean prancing, if you ever saw it you could tell it's not authentic - even if you haven't seen any Native ceremonies, tho I have been lucky enough to have witnessed a few).  If an Indian (pacific) dressed up as a hick trucker (ventilated hat, greased shirt, mullet hair, etc) and said he was merely honoring the Trucking heritage, central IL would be up in arms.  That is the same way of stereotyping the Chief represents.  Be realistic ppl, if its not your heritage how are you the best person to judge how it should be honored.  Simple, you're not. And yet, even more compelling is  urlLink this .

      I had nothing planned for today.  I had the agency breakfast in the morning like every Friday, and I had to look at the November billing at 11.  That was it.  Now I'm insanely busy with tons of shit to do.  I have an impromptu mtg in half an hour that I have to prep for (we will be fighting with the client probably), I have estimate revisions to take care of, the other client has issues with the script for the new spot and it probably has to be rerecorded which means the dubs aren't going out today, I need to talk to the production guy except he dropped off the face of the planet, I need to tell the VP  something , but I have nothing to go on as of yet (eeek), and a few more things that aren't as pressing (get 2 more SE jobs opened, talk to talent abt getting estimates for the TM, etc.)  How the hell does work manage to do that??

(i.e. car radio vs. turn signal ticker sound) -- (fyi: this applies to almost everything) *People do not listen.  They really don't.  They think they do, but in reality they're just waiting for you to stop talking so they can tell you what they think, regardless of what you just said. *I take antibiotics waaaay too much. *It's scary how many people I know from home or school who work within a 3 block radius of me. *The fact that I get along with the creatives at work like 10 times more than the AEs says something important. *I'm starting to really like martinis. *Everyone, at multiple points in their life, feels inadequate. *I may not know what I'm going to do with my life, but I do know that it will be interesting. *I hate these little asterisk thingies  Best billboard I've seen lately: [picture of an expensive diamond necklace] "Three billion guys in the world and she picked you. Your friends don't understand it either."

      So I haven't posted here lately.  I know.  I just wanted to ignore all of you. MUAHAHAHA!!  ok, no.  I've just been kinda busy at work and honestly have had nothing to write about in here.  This week went by not fast, not slow, but normal I think - basically it's not Friday yet and I wish I could go home (or at least visit my boy).    What I really want is my supervisor to get back so I can talk to here abt this ACNielsen data and go home already.  I've been waiting since 5.  grrr...

      And I'm loving it!! Sorta, cept that I keep playing with my bouncing Tigger I got from Zarana.  It's a pretty good feeling that I have my shit done and I don't have to run around trying to accomplish anything today.  I've been filing most of the day, something that has been extremely neglected these past few weeks with new business and creative pitches going on.  It's nice, relaxing, and I'm slowly going insane.  Not really, but not doing anything is completely uncorrelated to this job for me and I find myself slightly annoyed that I don't have stuff to accomplish today.  (Yeah I know, I can't be pleased.)    In other news, xmas is two, countem two days away, and I am still shopping for ppl.  I hate xmas shopping this year, which is insane cuz I usually love it.  I think I've just been super stressed lately and I need a break from things.  Unfortunately this isn't really going to happen, but I can try.  I'm moving this weekend and the next, so I'm getting things ready for that.  Thankfully the xmas stuff will be over in a few days (christmas with my family usually extends for like a two week celebration - it's one of the joys of having a broken family, you need to celebrate with each of the parts separately - but not this year [yay])  I'm also doing the first ever "significant other" holiday celebration.  I feel old.

      Ok so it's 7:15am and the director said that she wanted this before her 7am phone meeting, but I had called her to tell her that when she gets in she should come by my office to get the Categories as I am still working on it. She did not come. She is not in her office. I am getting the feeling that she either does not have a 7am mtg, or she's just being mean. I want to go home. I haven't yet.   The scarier part was that I wasn't here alone tonight. We are pitching a new client this afternoon and there were about 20 of us who worked into the night, and about 15 of us who stayed here. This would explain the shower at work. "Why would a company have a shower? Oh. Right."   Man, I don't get paid enough for this....

      So I get to the el this morning and I realize that I forgot my transit card at home, AND I have no cash on me.  I blow.  I have to get cash, fast, and get on the train cuz our agency meeting is this morning. (ack!)  But the coolest thing happened: a homeless guy, seriously homeless, let me use $1.50 from one of the transit cards he had in his hand.  [Why the guy had transit cards I have no clue] I was shocked.  And extremely thankful.  He then told me to not forget about this if I saw him on a corner.  Man, I'm lucky sometimes.  I'm also planning on giving that guy 5 bux the next time I see him at the station, which will most likely be tomorrow morning.  I love my guardian angel.

      Those of you who thought sharing an office would be cool raise your hand.  Now put your hand down fool.  Man, I was excited about sharing an office.  I thought that I'd be able to make some friends and possibly rag on the people in my group with others (okay so probly not that, but at least the friend thing) and now I shouldn't worry cuz I've got four of them in my new office with me.  FOUR.  There's a total of 5 of us in one freakin room.  And I do not like any of them.  Insanity.  I again hate my job.

      on December 14th.  I am SO excited.  I haven't seen this girl in AGES and I miss her way too much.  Best friends are not meant to move far far away from home.  I just talked to her for a lil (today is her bday - happy 23rd girl!!) and she doesn't want me to go to UFL cuz I might never come back - psssh.  Please, who wants to live in Florida?  The weather sucks and there's nothing to do there. hehe okay so maybe not =)  But it's super sweet to feel loved.  I just realized something.  I have two weeks off of work for *free* and a TON of books in my house that I haven't had time to read.  Ooooh baby.....  I am way too excited about reading right now. =)  To happiness......*clink*

      Have you ever gone through your ramblings in a journal years later after everything has worked itself out?  It's scary how much you really knew back then, but wouldn't listen to yourself.  I sometimes ignore my ramblings but if I had read them carefully I would have seen a lot of insights sooner.   Incoherent thoughts sometimes hold the most clarity.  "Scarred and hurt I lie in myself - a contrived cell Differences are vanquished, Conformity is law, and all is Hell."  "She is the sum of yourself and             your dream. As for me, I am a watercolor. I wash off."

      Ok so the past few days have been really hard to get through.  As the post below states, my friend Adam died last week.  I've known him since I was 14, we went to high school and college together.  He was a good friend of many years, who I expected to be around for many more.  He wasn't the straightest of arrows or the happiest of people, but he had an incredible energy about him that was simply contagious and wonderful to be around.  I will miss him greatly and his passing is a loss for all who have known him.  He will always be in my heart and his memory will be kept alive by all of us.  This tragedy has made me contemplate life a lot lately.  I believe that sometimes things happen that just kick you into gear and make you realize what has been or will be.  Adam's death, coupled with the fact that we have had layoffs consistently for the past several weeks, has renewed my interest in  urlLink VCU  and attending graduate school with a vengeance.  I have about 25% of the application completed (I still have to have my GRE scores sent and fill out my FAFSA etc, but I'm well on my way.)  I know that even though life seems desolate at times, change can and will happen - you just have to make the first move sometimes.

(Which sucks as everyone knows I'm sure).  I am trying to expand my horizons, I just want it to get warmer first.  50s-60s would be nice.  That's all I ask.

      It's funny how sometimes you predict things without realizing it.  You seem to inherently know what will happen in the future even if you deny it or make yourself believe something else.  I have found this to be true in three different people this past week.  I feel as if sometimes people don't listen to themselves enough, cuz if they did they would hear the outcomes of their lives SCREAMING at them in multiple ways.  Lately I've been having all these thoughts and all these feelings that I almost feel I shouldn't be having, that I shouldn't be feeling - that it's almost WRONG to do so.  Today I realized that it's not wrong.  It's merely me trying to figure out what's going on, trying to figure out myself.  I have so much growing up to do its insane.  And while my mother keeps telling me that I'm "on my own" and she's so proud of me, I feel ridiculous: living "on my own" is just like living in college, only now I pay  all  of my own bills and pay her money as well.  I have been listening to a friend talk about how he wants to move away from the midwest, that he needs to "get out of here" - I understand that feeling all too well.  I feel like I merely pushed the adventurous part of me to the back and left it there.  It's starting to stir.  And it's scaring me.  Sometimes you can look back over the past year and feel like you've grown so much.  And other times I look back and feel as if I'm still trapped.  Still peddling uphill without knowing where the fuck I'm going.  I want change.  And I almost feel as if it doesn't happen to me on it's own, I will burn bridges, breakup with friends, say goodbye to someone I love, goodbye to everyone I love, and make it happen my-goddang-self.  It's funny how a day that was relatively good turns bad in less 5 mins.  I want another good day.

      Dear Technical Support:         Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall does not work on this program. Can you help me, please!!!        Thanks, A TROUBLED USER    --------------------------------------------------------------------------   Dear TROUBLED USER:        This is a very common problem men complain about, but is mostly due to a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES & ENTERTAINMENT program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run everything. It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained.  It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than with the original system. Look in your manual under "Warnings-Alimony/Child Support". I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation. I suggest installing background application program C: \ YES DEAR to alleviate software augmentation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs).  You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause. The best course of action will be to enter the command C: \ APOLOGIZE. In any case avoid excessive use of YES DEAR because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the operating system will return to normal.  The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high maintenance.  Consider buying additional software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0. Do not, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system.         Best of luck, Tech Support

      It's amazing how disappointing someone at work makes me feel depressed.  Like I just got a bad grade on a test or didn't have time to do a homework assignment and went to class anyway and had to tell the teacher that I didn't have time to do it.  Ugh.  Lately work has been busy.  No, BUSY.  We have three new business pitches in the coming weeks and I have all this other crap to get together in the mean time and I'm not sure how it all is going to get done.  Not to mention all this crap I have to do in my own personal life: groceries, cleaning, laundry, cable guy, etc.  It's so weird, when I wake up in the morning I'm thinking abt work: what I need to do today, meetings I have etc.  I do this and plan out my day a lot during showering, putting on clothes, and getting my ass out the door.  Then the outside hits and my mind blanks until I rise up again to the street half a block from my work and get pummeled with meeting agendas and people I need to meet with before noon.  Arg!!  Then when I leave at the end of the day I start thinking about everything that I have to do at home and what time I have left to do it in (cuz I usually don't leave till around 7pm).  And the sad part is, that as I'm falling asleep I'm running through a list of things that I have to get done in my head for tomorrow.....when the hell did my life become about tasks and completion dates and meeting times and everything else that has made me want to scream all day today.  And for those who think the weekend is a welcomed break, well it's not.  Not just cuz I have tons of shit to do at home, but cuz I don't get a break from work - I'll be here this weekend trying to finish this presentation before Monday cuz I'm booked solid that say and it has to be done by end of day Monday - ugh.    I am annoyed with my grown-up life.

      First, I just found out that we are shooting in either Prague, Vienna, or Buenos Aires for the new Summer's Eve spots.  And I also found out that I MIGHT be able to go along!!!  Fingers are crossed people, fingers are crossed..... And second, I just received a bonsai tree from my Hillshire client as a holiday gift.  Super-sweet yes, and I am excited....but I'm pretty sure the thing will die.  Have you ever looked at caring for a bonsai tree? It's insane!  You have to water it every 2-3 days, it needs at least one hour of sunlight a day, and should be kept between 40-60 degrees all day long.  And to water this sucker, you have to immerse it in 2 inches of water in a pan, and spray it sometimes with a water mist in order to keep the mineral deposits from forming on top of the soil....please!!  So much work.  Anyone wanna give a timeframe on this thing before I kill it?  I'm thinking a month. Tops.

      How important does a person have to be before they are considered assassinated instead of just murdered? Why do you have to "put your two cents in"...but it's only a "penny for your thoughts"? Where's that extra penny going? How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good idea to put wheels on luggage? Why is it that people say they "slept like a baby" when babies wake up like every two hours? Why are you IN a movie, but you are ON TV? Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then put money in binoculars to look at things on the ground? Stress is when you wake up screaming and then you realize you haven't fallen asleep yet.

      I was going through some stuff that was in my desk in Skokie, and I found a letter that someone had written to me a couple of years ago.  It made me well up with tears after the first two sentences and I had to put it away cuz my Mom was getting a little suspicious.  I vaguely remember this letter and I felt horrible about that.  It was a letter that I should have never forgotten, and have now promised never to forget.  I read it last night before I went to sleep, and as I was crying I realized that sometimes it takes things like this to make you realize how far you've come in life and how much one person can care about another.  Sadly, it also made me realize that feelings change and people who once felt so strongly about someone, can have only lukewarm feelings for them (if that) years later.  It was nice to be reminded of how strong a bond once was however, and to know in my heart that I will have that again.  At the time the letter was given to me it made me cry for days.  This time I still cried, but felt the love that surrounded the words and was appreciative to have been so important to someone.  I felt loved and cherished years after that letter was written.  I felt lucky to have been a part of it.

      I just came back from a baby shower for a girl who I grew up with.  We used to play ball in the street, ride bikes, and get each other into (and out of) trouble.  I'm feeling incredibly old and was a lil tired of all the "aww-ing" by the end of it (it was 4 hours long).  I love Mandy - she kicks ass - but dang girl, a baby?! Wow.  Lil Vanessa or Kayla is due at the end of this month, so my childhood playmate will soon be a Mom.  Yeah, we got old.  I must have been sleeping when that happened, cuz I don't recall when all of us got to this point.  It's scary and I don't really want any part of it right now.  Wouldn't it be awesome if the problems in your life were about getting to go to bed later and whether or not you could ride your bike to a certain part of town?  I miss those days.  Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about where my life will lead me in the coming years, but to be so certain and definite about my life is something I think I'll always miss (unless I freakishly acquire that again, but I've been told that it's just a pipe dream).  Lately I feel the need to stretch my wings or something.  This is literally happening as I just moved into my own apt (yay!!), but I think it's also more in a emotional way.  I'm not sure.  I want to DO something.  I feel like all I really do is work and talk to the ppl I've been talking to for the past 6 months (no offense to you kidz cuz you know you rock).  I just miss meeting new ppl and having new experiences.  Doing more than the 9-to-5 thing with some movies and bars on weekends.  I miss being incredibly busy with things and always having something to do and someone to do it with.  I need to branch out.  I need to have more going on.  When I figure out exactly how I'm going to accomplish that I'll let you know, but for now I'm on the prowl.  I figure I've got pretty good chances as I'm now actually living in Chicago - there's gotta be something that I'll love right?  Now my goal is to simply find it.

      I received a journal for xmas and have since been putting a lot of my thoughts in there instead of here.  Sorry about that.  It's just more portable and what not.  Curling up in bed surrounded by blankets and pillows and just writing.  I missed it more than I thought.  And I've become more introspective as a result. (Kind of hard not to when you're pretty much pouring out what's in your mind).  And I've come to a small conclusion.  I need to make a decision.  A decision about my life.  And it must happen this year. - actually by August.  I've been putting it off since last fall, and if I don't make the leap now the opportunity will slip from my fingers.  And that is def worse than making a wrong decision.  At least I'll learn something from a wrong decision, if I make no decision then I've left the outcome in the hands of others, and that  will not  happen.

      So Rupal went to this performance thing last night (her new and exciting hobby - it makes me want to get a hobby) and she meets the guy who she gets along with really really well.  And as it turns out I KNOW THE KID!  I worked with him all through college and he was my buddy since freshman year.  We lost touch after he went to Europe right before graduation and I was super sad, but had gotten over it "just one of those things."  Well, apparantly it wasn't "just one of those things" cuz him and my roomie are gonna do a show together and collaborate on some projects and what not and he is back in my life!!  I'm so super excited about this it's insane.  I smilied all the way to work today.  And then I saw Asad on the train - that was kickass.  Today has a nice glow to it.

      Where deals, and meals, are done.  Yes, I had one of those today, and YES I DO feel better about my bitchy boss and my crappy-ass job.  I found out that not only does she suck with me, she sucks with EVERYONE and there are more ppl at work who hate her - BUT I resolve to adapt (till I leave here anyway).  And another job should be easy to find, as long as I'm not too picky - which I dount I will be considering I'm off to grad school in 6 lil months.  6 months!!  That's such a short time.  Ira made me swear on my life that I'd come back to Chicago after school - I said I would, but I also didn't say when! =)  I actually smiled today.  Wow.

I have had it with this place.  I'm so sad all of the time.  I work amazingly long hours for amazingly low pay.  I hate the people, I hate the atmosphere, I hate everything about this place that makes me feel less than two inches tall on a daily basis.  I'm out.  Let the searching begin.

      Today is already the BEST day of the past weeks.  The presentation from hell is over, it went well.  All of the major projects I've had are now complete and I only have to deal with my daily 18-25 different things.  Plus the musician at Washington on the Blue line decided to play "How Deep is Your Love" today and had me smiling and singing on my way to work.  I went to bed last night at 8 (I didn't see the end of The Apprentice so if anyone did please fill me in), and we have Monday off cuz of President's Day.  GO PRESIDENTS!!!  I'm going to a party tonight at the  urlLink Darkroom  where an eclectic mix of downtempo, afrobeat, latin, electro, nu jazz, and house will be playing (yeah I got that from the website, but at least that's more clear than "world music" which I was going to say originally.)  Wow I'm smiling.  This hasn't happened in weeks....  Today looks like it's going to be a good day.

      So I thought that yesterday was the shittiest day at work that I've had in quite a long time.  Well that day was just topped by today.  I cried in the bathroom for like 15 mins after being yelled at for about the same time.  I simply can't understand how one person can have a horrible viewpoint of your work, while others rave about you.  It doesn't make sense!!  Except for the fact that she doesn't see 90% of the work I do and can't understand why it takes me so long to get her work done.  This job is insane.  This job blows.  I don't think I'm cut out to do this.  School is a hugely welcomed vacation compared to this hell.  I can handle school.  School doesn't make me feel 2 inches tall and make me cry when I get home.  School is Jamaica compared to here.  And yes, I'm still in hell.  I'll probly be here till at least 9 tonite. Again, School is Jamaica compared to here.

      Today blows.  I feel so alone.  Rationally I know that I'm not, but I miss having someone close to me nearby.  That didn't make sense.  I mean I miss having someone who knows me, really really knows me, within a 10 minute drive.  It seems like I went from having many people I could talk to and share almost everything with - all within an arms reach it seemed - and now.....yeah lonely.  I want someone who I can grab some coffee with this second cuz I really need to talk, and have them just understand me from my body language.  I don't have to say anything really.  They just know that having them across from me is all I really need.  I needed to know that they were there and that they understood me without me having to say anything at all.  I need them to know me that well.  I miss that.  I want that.  I need that.  There's so much in my head right now.  It needs to come out, but there's no one to tell it all to.  And that makes me cry.  A lot.

       Invictus  Out of the night that covers me,  Black as the Pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.  In the full clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud, Under the blugeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.  Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.  It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.  ~William Ernest Henley

      I share an office with two other women and sometimes it just sucks that cliques exist at the agency and that my boss is in theirs.  It makes it hard to be anything more than cordial with them, and when ppl share things - I'm not included.  I'll be honest, it hurts when I'm in the same-freakin-room and not acknowledged by them or ppl in their group who come by.  It's kinda like - what the fuck??  But I know I: 1. Don't wish to be in their group - they're not really my kind of ppl and 2. Can't be in their group cuz they hang out after work together and my boss, my direct boss, will always be there.  She even dated the brother of one of my "roommates".  See what I mean??  Clique.  It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't in my face all dang day.  It's just frustrating at times, and one of those times happens to be now.

      My boss is leaving for the rest of the week to go skiing.  I am now incharge of all of the processes since she is gone.  I'm not as scared/freaked out about that as I thought I would be, but I'm still not that ok with it.  There is SO MUCH to remember and remind ppl about and schedule and manage that it's insane.  That coupled with the fact that my manager is not too happy with me at this moment.  (That sucks btw, I need to fix that somehow - I always seem to disappoint her).  I am now going home, and its only 7:54pm - how wonderful.  I have my first meeting at 11:15 tomorrow so I think I'm going to come in a lil late (say 9:20) cuz I'm sure to be here late tomorrow and I have the SE creative presentation at 8-freakin-am on Wednesday.  Ok.  So can anyone say "swamped"??

      Congrats to  urlLink Rupal  for finishing the race within her target time!!  I *might* participate next time - if I don't wimp out like this time.  Sorry Rups.  This weekend was tiring - after having a mental breakdown on the highway on Friday after hanging out with Paul, I decided to spontaneously drive down to Purdue.  This was elongated by the fact that I sat through 3 rounds of traffic jams and it took me like 3 hrs and 30 mins to get there - ugh! But my boy was super happy that I came and all was well in Robyn-land. I apparantly gave some kickass advice to a friend, as you all know I am exceedingly good at, and had major cuddletime with my boy that was def appreciated. I left feeling happy - and that rocked cuz I was so sad on my way down.  I'm not sure what I did, but G-d decided to punish me with a cold this week.  I'm all stuffy and I have a headache.  And I *almost* sneeze like 5 times a minute.  It's kinda sucking.  But Paul's mom gave me some free meds and I'm gonna head over somewhere and by more - nothing like working all doped up on cold medicine.  Lunch with Juliet is today (you rock Juliet!!) - I miss that girl a lot.  Our 1030am coffee runs at Cosi *sniff sniff*  But thank god we still talk, I'd be way too sad if I lost her as a pal.  Rumors of a trip to Las Vegas are circling in Robyn-land.  We will see what pans out on this, but I've wanted to go to Vegas forever.  I'm extremely excited abt this rumor. =)  And that's abt all I can think of to update ppl on my life thus far. - I know a certain someone wants to know whats been making me so sad lately, and whenever we are actually home at the same time and neither one of us is hella tired, we shall talk.  Till then, I bid you all "good day."

      And here is  urlLink an article  on the layoffs I was part of.  There are about 50-60 ppl letf at the agency now, which is so sad.  I feel bad for the company, but I'm so happy that I don't have to worry about any of it anymore.  I know, that's mean and selfish, but I can't help feeling that way.  And I want to buy  urlLink this book  on oppositional culture and it's ability to be simultaneously mainstream using the Simpsons as an example.  So kickass.  I want I want.

      So yeah I still hate my job.  What is it now?  Almost 6 months later?  This place has not gotten better - I've just become more used to being bludgeoned every day and feeling 2 inches tall consistency.  Wow.  Fun.  So I decided to take a position with Performics.  I was offered a job by them before, but turned them down for this (crappy) one.  Now I'm returning to them and they are giving me more money (a plus), an acct. coordinator title (plus), and a hourly wage (minus!) with no benefits (minus!!).  But in 2-4 months I'll be moved up (depending on my learning curve) and I will then get the salary wage and benefits.  Added pluses:  Total commute to work including walking and waiting for train: 15 mins (rock!!).  Friend from high school at work who I'm still good friends with: Lydia.  ACTUAL 9-5 job, not saying 9-5 and actual 9-9.  Nice people at work (work people can be nice??).  And last but not least: no more Omarosa!!!!  (People in-the-know will know who I'm talking about.)  So yeah.  I'm supposed to start on April 1st.  I think I'm going to tell them that I want to be laid off.  Once my offer letter is signed and what not.  I'd rather be let go from a job I've worked for less than 6 months, then leave it.  *sigh*    Also talked to the people at UFL - I'm all set for enrollment this fall. Yay!! Supercool, and now I get to book my flight and what not to Gainesville to visit.  I'm super excited abt that =)  Change is occurring.......get ready for one hell of a ride.....

      Yeah I know, I complain about her, I whine about her, but in the end she always has my best interest at heart and she really does love me a whole lot.  Evidence:  she just signed up for a Bally's membership and added me on as my birthday present.  This is WAY cool as I looked into the whole thing and found it too terribly expenisve for me to do right now.  The drawback? No digital camera. =(  But considering what I was willing to pay for the membership, I'm sure I can save for the camera.  I think I'll use any birthday money I get, plus any lil I can save, to buy one.  I can't believe she did that.  She knows I was so sad that I couldnt afford a gym membership right now, and granted, she's making me go with her to the gym at the beginning till she gets used to the place and what not (super cute), but I am WAY happy abt this.  Plus I get free raquet ball, which apparently you usually ahve to pay for - so watch out, I might just take up the game.  I'm really excited she did this, plus feeling extra loved.  My mom rocks.

      Happy 25th Birthday Mike!!  Gran Prix weekend was a lil rollercoaster of emotions, but ended so sweetly.  I truly am super lucky to have someone in my life who I love so much.   I'm really tired lately.  I think I need two days of nothing but lounging.  Not gonna happen tho.  Sadness.  Tonight is my bro's birthday dinner, wed is possible movie night, thurs is round-up-laundry night (yes, this takes a whole night), and friday is girls-night-in (which I am looking forward to a great deal cuz I haven't had one of those in ages.)  This weekend: hopefully laundry will get done, my room will be cleaned, chores will get done, groceries will be bought, and I will be able to sleep - a lot.  That's the plan, I hope everything goes accordingly, but who am I kidding - stuff never goes according to plan.  But isn't that what makes life great? (eh Rups?)

      I am FINALLY done with my Target landing pages work.  Ugh.  That literally took me 3 days to complete.  I want to shoot myself.  And I never want to see the Target.com page again in my life.  Kill me, kill me now.  Ileana has an interview here tomorrow - I'm excited cuz I think this would be a great place for her to start her career.  I know she'll do well.  I miss my boy.  He's far away and we don't really talk all that much lately.  We need to reconnect.  Hopefully that will happen this weekend, but its Grand Prix so everyone and his mother is coming down.  Should be fun tho.  I def won't be drinking anything more than something casual, tho if I'm still on my meds I'll be drinking nothing at all.  Both sleep and hunger have evaded me these last few days and I want to do all I can to coax them back.

      I know I made a really long post but I need to say this.  It sucks when you lose friends.  for any reason.  But it really sucks when you lose friends because they become someone else's friend instead of yours.  And yes, this does make sense.  Ppl have their own friends, and then there are mutual friends.  But when a friend goes from being your friend, to a mutual friend, to being "his/her" friend it really hurts.  And it sucks.  And I don't want that friend anymore cuz ya know what?  They fucking chose to not be around and not call and not be with me.  So they can go suck their own dicks with their thumbs up their butts for all the damn I give.  Fuck'em all.  And I really REALLY hate, and I mean HATE ppl who use other ppl to get to someone.  FUCK ALL OF YOU PPL WHO HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DOING THAT.  You should first be ashamed of yourselves, and second you should no longer talk to me.  I am done being anything whatsoever to you.  Not a friend, not an acquaintance, and most def not someone you can say you know.

      The thing I think I dislike most abt having an online journal thing, is that people who I sometimes do not want to know my thoughts can easily read them.  This in turn creates an internal censorship of the material I put up here which then inhibits my ability to fully express myself.  That being said, please understand the vague nature of the following post.  I went to visit friend at U of I this weekend.  It was really great to see a lot of them - esp ppl who I haven't seen in ages and really was glad to spend some time with.  I came to an understanding tho at one point during my visit, that although I missed college life and the way things were for me then so badly, I knew that I had changed this past year.  I can't put my finger on it, but I could feel that I was different.  I just wasn't the same person as I was then, and unlike the last time I visited, I had no wish to be that person.  I feel like while I was waiting for life to change, it already had and I just hadn't noticed yet.   Well I noticed this weekend.  And I'm def not a college girl anymore.  I'm slowly adapting to my city life and emerging as a working gal (which is not as scary as I originally thought - seriously!!).  Also, the stupid grad school stuff.  I wanted to go to grad school to further my educational experience as soon as possible.  Meaning, I didn't want to leave college life.  I've actually been able to move past that and accept this transition (which I SO doubted I would like).  I am still interested in grad school, but now it is more about the program I will be going to and how much it is going to cost me, rather than going to the school furthest away from Chicago and the best ranked school.  Don't get me wrong, rankings still matter, but when I'll be $45 grand in the hole I tend to reevaluate how important that ranking is to me.  Most likely, I will be attending UIC in the fall of 2005.  Ick.  Yeah.  So much for attending grad school right out of college! =)  but the program is cool and cheap and easily accessible.  And if my current employer is as felxible as I imagine, I think something would be able to be worked out where I would still work 40 hours a week, but I would be able to take some day classes, cuz UIC's program isn't just at night like hella-expensive DePaul's is.  oi.  But the plan (yeah you all know I always have a plan) is to apply to both schools for the fall of 2005 and see what happens.  I wish I was going this fall, I really do, but it just doesn't seem to be in the cards.  Also a plus would be that I hope to be making more money by then as well, so the additional tuition won't be as much of a strain on my budget as it would be now.  I feel really far away from the college life I used to treasure so much.  The friends that I have kept from that journey are amazing and I love each and every one of you.  For those who have fallen to the way side throughout the years, I wish you well.  For the ones that are falling now, please allow more time for old friends.  We share the best memories.  Please don't let all those great moments die.  While I know I won't be able to keep all of the friends I made, I def feel that I have made some good choices in the ones I have fought to keep.  All in all, this weekend was a learning experience.  For more than just me.  It's nice to actually have a time where you can sit back and really understand that you're on your way.  to what, I have no clue, but I am on the way.  And the road is def less scary than once imagined becuase of the people who chose to walk it with me.

      - My roommates and I had a mtg last night and decided on when we are all available to have parties/get-togethers/shin-digs at the abode.  First one? May 8th.  Mark it on your calendars. - My boy is graduating in two short weeks, and I can't wait!! - I feel comfortable in my life today.  It's nice. - All, countem ALL, of the doctors I've been going to are included on my new insurance - that rocks SO hard. - I finally feel ok that I'm not going to UFL in the fall (for those of you who don't know, those bastards didn't give me enough money) - but I found a program at UIC ironically, that combined what I was planning on creating for my study down there.  Life is really weird how it works out sometimes.... - I miss Ira.  I want her to come home.  Soon. - A friend and I had a fight yesterday.  It was stupid.  Well, it started out being abt something stupid, then it turned out he was using that stupid thing as a metaphor for a bigger thing.  But didn't let on abt that till abt an hour into the fight. grr. I'm sad about the situation.  I wish we could see more eye to eye.  I still don't think that it's that big of a deal, but to him it is and because of that we're taking a little space right now. =( - I randomly ran into a kid who went to North last night, as CTA Blue Line riders had to be rerouted at Washington because some smart ass decided to jump the train.  But it was nice to run into someone who's face was familiar.  Plus I bet we would have been friends in college.  Not high school cuz I was this academic jock the entire time, but college was diff - I def wasn't that anymore. - I want my life to be nothing but what it is today.  I haven't felt that way in so long.  Too long.  It's a great feeling.

      So today is the two-workweek mark for robyn's lackadaisical effort to quit smoking.  I have had one, count it one, cigarette since March 29th.  This is cool, no doubt, but man it is really weird when you feel all crappy and you just wanna release it - and you no longer can in 2 min.  You now have to change, get to the gym, and run.  ugh.  Too much work.  I need to find another quick stress reliever.  I thought abt alcohol, but if I'm pounding a beer every time I have a bad day, that's just asking for alcoholism.  So right now I'm coming up blank on the stress thing and just end up crying a lot.  Like a LOT.  I think so far this week I've cried every other night.  Granted, it is also my week to cry so I'm sure that adds into it, but still! This is too much in my book.  I've also looked into joining Bally's and I think I've found a plan I can do.  I just need someone to join with me - and that blows =(  Unless the plan works for Rupal as well, then that would rock! =)  My fingers are crossed.....

I knowingly, consciously, and purposfully do things I know will make another person mad, sad, angry, etc.  I absolutely HATE doing things out of spite.  And yet it still happens.  I wonder when I'll finally outgrow this.  Cuz it has to be a phase.  I can't possibly be doing this when im 40, and yet there are ppl who I've worked with who have been near retirement and like that.  Damn.  (**realization that i wont grow out of it, that ill have to make the decision not to do it any longer**).  Well right now I'm not ready to be that mature.  Fuck it.  I want to piss someone off and I can so I will.  Fuck being the bigger person.  Screw the jerk-off.  And yet, I just stopped myself from doing something out of pure spite.  Perhaps there is progress, I'm just not aware of it....

      This weekend was fun, weird, and semi-productive.  I am *this* much closer to having a clean room.  The end is near!!!  the best boy in the entire world (aka my boyfriend - so yeah, maybe I'm a lil biased) came to visit and I was very smiley.  He really is a great guy. *sigh*  Ok enuf of that mushiness.  It was also a weekend of old friends, old boyfriends to be exact.  One stopped by randomly and another called me out of the blue - for breakup advice no less!  This I found funny cuz I'm not sure if he remembers our breakup, but it wasn't pretty.  He was pretty much an ass (which he fully admitted no prodding necessary!) and I hated him for a long time because of how he handled it.  So I think I might have been a little too free in giving advice on what he should and should not do. =)  I'm sorry for that, but hopefully the girl will be less hurt, or at least get over it sooner.  That was my good deed for the week. =)  I have many random things to get done this week: laundry, finish cleaning my room (finally!!), figure out Easter plans with the fam, and generally sleep a lot more.  Last week was def missing in the sleep dept and I tried to catch up this weekend (sorry Bri) but I know it wasn't anough.  I'm tired again today. I want to bring back naps.  College made naps kickass, I want to bring them back into the work world.  Lil siestas during lunch.  Yeah, I'd really dig that.

      Today I came to the realization that I will probably be leaving Chicago in August.  It is the most promising avenue for me at the moment.  Sadly I cannot pass up the opportunity I suppose.  I would love to stay here.  How ironic after wanting to leave for so long.  One of the best friendships of my life is currently being tested and I hate having to leave in the middle of that.  It won't be over for awhile and I want to be here to fight for it.  I'm sad that I might lose that not because it was time to, but because I wasn't there to make the effort.  I'm sad today.  I want to go home, curl up in a bed and sleep for hours.  Waking up when the sun has risen again and I can finally feel like the past is behind me, instead of looming in front of me like a shadow.  Taunting me while it hovers all around. I have cried too much lately.  The tears keep coming and I don't know how to make them stop.   I need to run.

      1.  I am SUPER proud of my Mom.  She's currently on the South Beach diet and has been sticking to it incessently.  She's already lost 4 pounds and it hasn't even been a week.  Go Mom!! 2.  My friends lately have been going thru hard times.  I wish I could hug every one of you every minute of every day.  Remember that someone loves you, and you are all cared about. 3.  A certain friend is trudging thru some relationship issues.  To her I tell her to follow what her gut tells her.  If he's right for you you'll know hon - you'll just know. 4.  To another friend I stayed on the phone with waaaaaaay too long last night - I love you.  You mean a ton to me and I am incredibly grateful to have you in my life.  Please don't walk away from an incredible friendship. 5.  And to everyone else struggling with issues out there (I already could name three more ppl here), you'll get thru it.  It'll suck, and it DOES suck, but it does have an end.  It will not last forever, and you will be happy again.  I promise you that.  Love and Hugs to all.

It can be anything you want, so long as it's something that's never happened. Then, of course, post this to your journal and see what people would like to remember of you, only the universe failed to cooperate in making it happen so they had to make it up instead. =)

      The 5-load washing machine.  Yes, I said 5 loads.  That amazing invention allowed me to do my laundry for a mere $15.  Total.  dang!!  I had two laundry bags, and two garbage bags of laundry and all, and I mean ALL, of it got done in 2.5 hrs.  I'm in love with the 5-load washing machine.  Plus, a one load machine costs $1.50, which isn't bad mind you, but the amazing 5-load machine costs $4 - that's a savings of $2, which is more than another load!!  I'm amazed, I'm astonished, and I'm in love with the laundromat by my house.  Did I mention that they're open till 2am on week days??

      is going on lately.  The party on Saturday was awesome - I had an amazing time. My room is **still** clean.  Yeah I know.  Hell has frozen over.  Talk to me in another week and we'll see what's up then =)  I just interviewed for a position at my company and it went SUPER well.  Even if they don't hire me actually talking about everything that I've accomplished and what I believe I am capable of was awesome.  I swear, interviewing is the most motivating thing.  I always leave feeling like I kick ass and if you're too dumb to see that, then I'm sorry Mr. Corporate but it's your loss! =)  I actually think I stand a *really* good chance at getting this job, but I don't have it yet so....  I should find out by next week. Yay! =)  Also, I found out today that the company that bought my company has tuition reimbursement!  In fact, they will be covering a lil over an entire semester per year for me.  That rocks SO much cuz it's like they're paying for half of my degree.  I'm way too excited about that for my own good right now.  Plus, this is dumb and nerdy, but they have e-training and I can learn Java on the side =)  Yeah I know, I'm dumb, but I wanna learn and I never really had the opportunity other than studying on my own (like that'll happen).  So all in all, this past week is going down as one of the best in my life post-college.  I've been all smiley today.  Plus, Irina now works literally two blocks away so we can get together after work and for lunch (like we did today) all the time!!  Waaay excited.  I've missed this feeling.  The feeling that I can take on almost anything and succeed.  I haven't felt this way in a long time.  Since school basically.  I def would enjoy more of this.

      For the past few months, hell since I graduated, I feel as if I've been lugging around anger, disappointment, stress, and a general feeling of ickiness.  I just saw signs last night that I'm starting to come around.  I spent some time with a friend who I've been neglecting. Even tho we live together we never saw one another and last night was some hardcore bonding time.  It was more than that tho, it was a laugh-till-I'm-crying-and-making-baby-sea-lion-noises kind of night.  A yellow-colored-hope-and-muffin-transformer-doll kind of night. It was great.  I haven't laughed that much in god knows how long.  I've missed it.  I've missed  me .  I had a conversation with a friend last week who told me that ever since I graduated I had changed.  I think it takes awhile to find yourself after graduating college. You are no longer defined by your circle of friends or by your major.  You are now thrust into the great big world and I'll admit, I was frickin scared.  I've been told to watch out for a depression that happens after graduating, but I thought that was all crock and didn't pay enough attention.  That "crock" actually turned out to be true, a little too true in fact, and now that I'm edging out of it I can see so clearly.  The whole graduation thing is like going outside into the sun after being in a building all day.  You keep blinking before your eyes adjust.  Then you can finally see and you begin your journey to wherever.  I just stood there blinking for too long, convinced I still couldn't see well enough to move.  Sometimes I wonder what life would had been like if I had gone to graduate school last fall and I'd be coming home right now for summer vacation (or would I??).  But it's so funny how I know for sure that my staying here was the best thing that could have happened.  I hate it when Mom's are right.  This past year I learned so much about myself and about what I want to do with my life.  Career-wise.  I'll be honest, I've been so focused on that aspect of my life that I've neglected just about everything else.  It became all consuming.  Now that I have more of an idea of what I want to do I've begun to look outside of that.  A question that a friend posed a few days ago, "What were your plans after moving to the city?" I stared blankly at her.  I didn't have an answer.  I planned on working.  But I knew that wasn't what she was talking about.  I realized that I had this great opportunity in front of me that I was just letting slip through my fingers.  I made a decision that day that although I learned the value of balancing work and life from my old job, I haven't quite put any of that lesson into practice.  And that's going to stop now.  I don't know exactly what I want to do, but I figure I'll be Rupalish abt it - just throw myself into what intrigues me.  Yesterday was one of the best days I've had in months.  I look forward to more like it.

Or "This purchase will be exceeding my limit."  I think that'd be really embarrassing tho, but then again wouldn't that be the point?

My favorite! 9 pm - Oh Boy! Sleeping in master's bed! My favorite!   Cat's Diary  Day 183 of my captivity... My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant. Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded -- must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair -- must try this on their bed. Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in an attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was. Hmmm, not working according to plan. There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the food. More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to my power of "allergies." Must learn what this is and how to use it. I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The bird on the other hand has got to be an informant, and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room, his safety is assured. But I can wait; it is only a matter of time...

      Monday, May 12 2003 Today was full of ups and downs. I'll do a comprehensive list to make it easier:  Ups: I got tickets to my graduation even though I was past the deadline. Now my mom won't murder me. This is good. I got another extension on my engl paper that is taking me forever and a day to do. My roommate is being nice this week. It's nice when home life isn't really stressful. I totally got an A on my Afro final and I got an A on my Afro paper that I got back today - each 20% of my grade - w00t!!  Downs: I found out that I got a C in 311 - by TWO questions!!! No, she doesn't give extra credit, or pluses or minuses, or change grades. So my 79.6 could have been a 70.1 and I would have gotten the same grade. wtf?! Fair? I think not... I'm being phased out of a group of friends. I know I'm leaving and that they'll still be here next year, but being replaced really hurts. I wrote over 15 pages of test essays today and my hand feels like it's going to fall off. It's my birthday tomorrow and no one can celebrate with me cuz it's finals week - even I can't celebrate cuz I have a final on wed =(  That was today.  ---------------------------------------------------- It's funny how things work out.  Graduation was a small success.  That paper got written in time (thanks to Ira - you rock girl!).  I don't talk to that roommate anymore, and I'm really okay with that.  I ended up getting an A in that Afro class - even tho that was the same class where I went to the wrong midterm (eeep!!).  I ended up with a B in 311 - I guess she found out I dated her daughter's leftovers and took pity on me. =)  The group of friends I though I was being phased out of, actually are still my good friends.  In fact I just ran over to them and cried on their shoulders a couple of weeks ago.  They def rock.  So the essays don't happen anymore, and I'll be going out for my birthday this year.....life has a weird way of working out.  I hope it continues to be that way.

      This is how I feel right now.  My life feels completely stagnant.  I want decisions to be made, I want stuff to happen already.  I want my job to hire me full-time or chuck my ass out so I can find a full-time opportunity.  I want my roommate to find out if she's leaving in August for a year so I can start looking for a studio sooner rather than later.  I want my boyfriend to get a job - any job - just so I'll know where he'll be for the next year.  I want life to start happening already.  It feels so horribly halted.  I feel like I'm running around everyone screaming at them.  I'm at normal speed and everyone else is moving in slow motion - like molasses.  It's so frustrating!!!

      This is how I feel.  (props to Juliet for the quote)  I had extremely little work to do on Friday so I began rereading some old posts.  I noticed a few things. 1. I used to be funny.  Not outrageously funny, but wry-smile funny.  I miss that.  2. I tend to make decisions quickly and often - ending up without making a decision at all.  This has yet to change. and 3. I ramble quite a lot.  I apologize for that.  I like to think it's just part of my charm =)

        You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs.     urlLink   What Type of Soul Do You Have ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I'm oddly tired lately.  (not because it is currently 2am, but because I feel drained.)  I want summer to come.  I want Irina to be home again.  I miss my girl. =(  I'm about to be 23 - one week from today in fact - and I already feel 24.  Craziness.  Lately I've been on this wild ride, and I def feel like it's time to get off.  I want peace, quite, love, and laughter - not in that particular order of course.  I guess I just want to feel free again.  I know that will come, but till then I feel laden with responsibility and expectations.  Sadness? yes.  But also a sense of relief and acceptance that comes with age.  Oh god.  Now I'm really feeling old.  I'm stopping now.

      This past weekend was kind of an emotional rollercoaster.  I'm fine now.  But I wasn't before.  Thank you SO MUCH to my girls at U of I - you helped me immensely this past weekend.  You'll never know how much better I felt after talking to you guys, crying to you guys, and making decisions and conclusions about my life with you there to support me.  I am forever grateful that all of you are in my life.  I felt surrounded by ppl who love and care abt me this weekend.  I don't think I can ever express how much I needed that or how much it meant to me that you freely gave it.  I love you all.

      So that kid from FL who keeps bugging me abt my apt search (see post below) just sent me ANOTHER email.  These ppl don't learn.  In other news, Sophie, a pal of Ranjit's, has decided to move into the apt.  I spent 45 mins last night talking to the girl - we DEF get along and I think she'd be a kickass roomie.  Now to get the others on board - if there are any others.  That's the only thing that's been stressin me lately - where the hell am I gonna live in Sept?  I need to start making some movement and I'm being a lil halted so that will be cleared up soon.  Jo is gonna decide whether or not she will be staying in the apt, and I will be finding out where I want to be living.  Too many options.  If Jo stays then either Debs or Sophie will be movin in.  If Jo goes, then probly both Deb and Soph will come on in.  If no Deb then Soph and I might get a place and if no Soph then Deb and I might get a place.  Either way stuff needs to start happening cuz time is running out.  First off, whether or not Jo will be staying.....

      I just found out today that my unbelievably cool boss is leaving. *tears* *many tears*  I REALLY liked that guy.  I was depressed about the whole work environment this morning.  I've already had a boss from hell, been laid off, been promoted, and now am losing an incredibly good motivating boss.  All in one year from graduating college.  THIS IS INSANE!!  I would like it to end please.  Life continues to be hard no matter what.  That sucks.  Good thing is laundry still smells amazing and I have family and friends who love me.  Cuz we all know that if laundry didn't smell half as good the world would grind to a halt.  (I think the only person who will understand any of that is Ruth and her knowledge of my obsession with laundry smell.)  Anyway, I resolve not to let his leaving get me down - although I am quite depressed abt it today.  Tomorrow is another day tho, and hopefully I'll have dealt with it better by then.

      My computer is now virus free thanks to my amazing, wonderful, talented, intelligent boyfriend.  You rock!!  AND Debbie said that she might be moving in - things aren't finalized, but she's like 80/20 on the idea.  It would be AWESOME if she did tho - we've been talking abt living together for SOO long, it'd be great to have that finally happen.  I am off to play some bocce ball, have some beer, and play with some beagles - the great 3 B's.  Today I am all smiles!! =) =) =)

      The premise: I had contacted a leasing agency at the University of Florida to help me find an apartment when I was considering attending the university.  Since that initial contact they have called me twice a week (phone calls I don't answer) and have sent me emails weekly.  Holy god.  I told them repeatedly that I'm in Chicago and won't be moving till August.  Just to reiterate this fact I sent a lil email to Matt, my leasing kid: ------------------------------ Hey Matt,  Nope, no decision yet. I'll be sure to let you know when I do though - in August cuz I won't be in FL till then. So in August, when I'm able to get down there to actually look at places, I'll be sure to let you know what I end up with. In August.  Thanks, Robyn  PS - Oh and if you couldn't tell I'll be moving in AUGUST - so I'll let you know then ok? Thanks buddy! ------------------------------ No reply as of yet. =)

      I haven't written in this for some time.  Been kinda busy / wanted to get away from it for awhile.  Lately things have been good.  The job is cool, my boss is really laid back and nice, but lately the work has gotten more intense and *harder* - didn't see that one coming.  One major difference that I am completely loving is that my boss gives positive feedback.  Wha??  This whole thing was so completely foreign to me, because my last job basically ignored that it existed and they actually went in the negative direction a lot.  It was really hard to be motivated there, and feedback was 98% negative.  Not a good working environment.  New boss likes to send little emails of: "Keep up the good work" and "You're getting the hang of it" - I get waaay too excited when I get these, and in true Robyn fashion I keep them =)  I know, I'm dumb, but it really is a HUGE breath of fresh air to get those.   As for others, Ira is finally home and I'm way happy she is =)  I've missed that girl a whole lot.  I don't think we'll lose what we have, which rocks to no end.  It probly doesn't hurt that I'm slowly becoming a yuppie which is what she's been since we were like 15 =)  Brian is still on the lookout for a job, but is a finalist (if not the hiree) of a great company he would love to work for.  I'm super excited for him!!  Plus it has an amazing location: just four blocks from my work! =)  Paul is currently in Cali interviewing for Dolby (wow!) and another company.  He's been crazy with the interviews, and I'm sure a company will recognize the amazingness of him and pick him right up (for the right price of course).  Everyone seems to be in a good place right now.  Rupal got into her Indicorps program and will be leaving us in Aug - SUPER sad =(  But it's a great opportunity for her, so GO RUPAL!! =)  On that note, I am looking for a roommate.  At least one, maybe more than one if my other roommate decides to move back home which is a real possibility.  So, if anyone knows anyone who needs a place in Chicago in August for only $360/mo (which you KNOW is a steal) let me know.  Including utilities I only pay $423/mo - that includes rent, heat, electricity, water, cable and internet.  Yeah, its an amazing deal.  So help spread the word ppl@!! =)

      I just reread some of my posts and came to the realization that I always  plan things .&nbsp; This is monumentally  stupid , as my plans have ALWAYS changed.&nbsp; (Rupal reminded me of that last night with the whole  "...and you said he's the one and you're gonna marry him, etc"  referring to someone I COMPLETELY would not want to be with anymore. *shudder*)&nbsp; Plans after graduation have included, but were not limited to: grad school - in san fran, florida, boston, IL, miami, minneapolis, and atlanta.&nbsp;(holy god.)&nbsp; A job - in chicago, suburbs, in advertising, in marketing, in pharmaceuticals, or in computers.&nbsp; Finally I settled into an internet marketing&nbsp;job in the loop, an apt in Bucktown (speaking of which we are having a party on August 7th so come if u can - email me if u don't have an address and want one), and grad school for New Media and Intercultural Communication with an emphasis in Media studies at UIC (way cool and   cheap   program.)&nbsp; And now again, that might change.&nbsp; AHHHH!!!!&nbsp;  There is no constant in the world except change. &nbsp; I've been told this time and time again, but it just hasn't sunken in yet.&nbsp; I think people make plans just so they have something to hold on to - or rather I make plans so I have something to hold on to.&nbsp; Something to look forward to.&nbsp; Something to depend on when everything else is undependable.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; I think I may have control issues.&nbsp; Granted I've known that for awhile.&nbsp; My childhood was full of things I couldn't control, things I had no power over but had to sway within the decisions and actions of others - I * really * hated that after I hit 11 or 12 and fully realized what was going on.&nbsp; I remember deciding that   I   was going to be in charge of my life and I wouldn't let things or people stop me from what I wanted.&nbsp; Then you get older and realize that things are a lot more complicated and a lot less black and white than they are when you're young.&nbsp; ( and sometimes people remind you of this over nice italian dinners .)&nbsp; You learn that taking one thing means leaving behind others and almost everything has a sacrifice - even getting something that you really really wanted  (hint: for you rups.)&nbsp;  As I've gotten older I've become more realistic with my plans - planning for the next year instead of the next 5 years - but lately even those plans seem like too far ahead.&nbsp; I'm coming to the conclusion that we are getting old.&nbsp; "We" as in my ppl, my friends, my comrades.&nbsp; "We" are getting engaged, buying houses, moving cross-country, moving cross-continents, and generally becoming grown-ups with responsibilities and bills and job-related stress. (I  really  hate that one.)&nbsp; And yeah I'm scared too.&nbsp; I actually have a savings account now.&nbsp; Me.&nbsp;  A SAVINGS account .&nbsp; Both my parents are in awe, and my mom keeps checking in to see how much I have in there.&nbsp; It's crazy.&nbsp; I've become the semi-reliable roommate as opposed to the wild one.&nbsp; My bed-time is before 12am on a regular basis.&nbsp; I will actually stay in on a Friday night to clean my room, do my chores and laundry cuz I know I'll be busy the rest of the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people&nbsp;have told me I've changed - I'm not as lax or easy-going anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to someone abt it and they pretty much pinned it on how I&nbsp;don't put up with as much crap as I did before.&nbsp;  Sometimes I just don't want to deal with other people's shit. &nbsp; I want them to grow up and make a decision and I don't want to have to hold their hand the entire time.&nbsp; Everything is not as dramatic as people make it out to be (myself included here - I'm a huge drama queen and I know it.)&nbsp; Time is money. And I'm poor.&nbsp; I care how I'm spending my time now.&nbsp; Granted I still have lazy movie nights with my girls and what not, but I sometimes don't feel like driving 2 hours to go to a party, or staying out late cuz everyone else is still out.&nbsp; Who cares? I'm tired and going home.&nbsp; I have stuff to do tomorrow.&nbsp; Your priorities change.&nbsp; Our priorities have changed.&nbsp; Crap, I can only imagine what that will be like when everyone I know starts to have kids. eeek!!&nbsp; So I dunno, I guess we're all just getting older and reorganizing our lives.&nbsp; It'd be nice to think it stops here, but it never does.&nbsp;   I guess I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping for the best life possible.

      I had an   awesome   weekend, much like  urlLink Rupal's  - and considering we were hanging out a lot this weekend it makes sense! =)&nbsp; Friday was girl night with Ira which turned out diff than expected, but was still fun.&nbsp; Saturday was full of  Rupalness  - I really will miss you  tons  roomie!!&nbsp; The apt just won't be the same.&nbsp; Then on Sunday I fought the worst hang over I've had in a long-ass time and did errands (got to return a movie late without a fee and had my groceries carried to my car by two good-looking black boys - I swear to god that race has a thing for indian chicks)&nbsp;, saw Fahrenheit 911 w/ Juliet who lives *right* by an  Edwardos  (score!) and&nbsp;ran over to my mom's place to visit with my brother.&nbsp; Sad news in his life - his gf broke up with him last week.&nbsp; Way not cool of her.&nbsp; He loves her  so  much.&nbsp; But at the same time I understand her position completely and am actually in a semi-related situation, but I think it took her a real long time to work up the nerve to do it.&nbsp; As much as I'm sad that he's crushed, I'm a lil proud of her cuz I know how hard it was to do that in her case.&nbsp;  Conflicted feelings much?? &nbsp; You could def say that.&nbsp; Lots o things conflicted lately - such is life tho, eh?&nbsp;   C'est la vie!    &nbsp;  The working out thing is coming along nicely.&nbsp; Figured out a good  routine : 30 mins elliptical machine warm-up, then weights (alternating upper and lower body), then abs (holy god they have this machine that almost makes me cry), and then 2+ miles of  running .&nbsp; I'm trying to get that up to 3 by the end of the month, but I'm not sure if that'll happen just yet.&nbsp; It takes almost 2 hours to do all that so I really don't want to be at the gym any longer than that.&nbsp; I also started a blog abt my progress, and don't even think abt it - I'm not giving that URL to anyone.&nbsp; It's mostly&nbsp;just so I can see what I've done etc.&nbsp; I also decided that I'm not gonna keep track of stuff (meaning my weight) cuz it'll just end up getting out of hand.&nbsp; I figure I'll&nbsp;reevaluate at the end of August and see what's happened.&nbsp; The working out part is   way   easier than the eating healthy and low-cal, low-fat, low-taste part.&nbsp; I'm trying right now, but I know that it won't last - I've already cheated a bunch of times.&nbsp;  Damn chocolate and it's hold on me! &nbsp; Apparently ppl can already tell a difference from the working out - ppl meaning my mom (tho I bet Ruth could too cuz she always had an amazing knack for telling me when I gained and lost weight without me knowing it myself.)&nbsp;Then again that's my mom, she's also the one who will periodically stare at me and tell me that I look pretty today - I don't usually, but today I do -&nbsp;so whatever.&nbsp; Her opinion sways with the tree leaves, but I'll be honest, it's really nice running again.&nbsp; I've missed it more than I thought.&nbsp; I dunno if I'll ever have the body I did in high school, but we'll see.&nbsp; It'd be a nice goal to have, but it's too early for that yet.

      Misc ramblings I imagine.  Lately (read past 5 years) I've been gaining weight and not really excercising a lot and Monday proved to make that ever-so apparent when I got fitted for a bra and had increased not only width wise, but I gained an entire cup size.  wtf.  I was pretty pissed.  Now I know that some ppl don't understand this, being mad that your boobs got bigger, but the trick is that it's not just my boobs that got bigger - the rest of me did as well.  I'm currently the heaviest I've ever been in my life, which I know in the grand scheme of things isn't that big, but the bra thing really pushed me to get going to the gym.  I'll be honest it's not that hard cuz I go after work and the gym is like 5 blocks away and there's another Blue Line stop about a block away.  Getting started is the hardest part, right?  So hopefully this will work.  I hate the bra size I have to wear so it's like motivation everyday or something.  Kinda cool, and yet kinda sad.  I hate having to watch what I eat tho - that's the part that really blows and the part that I think I won't be able to continue so well.  Ah well, at least the running will continue. =)

      Deborah Gail Ranchero is moving into the apt!!  Yay!  I'm SUPER excited about this.  Debs has been my friend since I was 14 - we've remained friends throughout different colleges, half a state between us, various boyfriends, development and destruction of multiple friendships with others, and Debs church - which takes up a good deal of both of our time. =)  I love the girl incessantly, and now she's going to be my roomie!! =)  Waaaay too excited!  Now all to get done is have the mother come and see the place, meet Jo, and the three of us get to sit down and talk about everything in the apt.  I'm waaay excited! =)  NOT moving is the greatest thing in the world.  And still being ablt to afford my life is the next best thing! =)  I am currently all smiles.   Funny how today I find out this great news, and today is the same day that I have to say goodbye to my Paulie.  The world always find a way to balance I suppose...

      First off, I'm sick.  My throat hurt a lil yesterday and today I woke up with it all swelled up.  Thought it might be aftershocks from bee sting that happened this weekend (yeah that was a load of fun) but its def sick-throat stuff.  My nose has ceased to be of any use as of an hour ago and my sinuses are completely stuffed.  Basically, I feel like crap and I'm at work.  I have a lot to get done today so I can't leave early, but I am TOTALLY leaving at 5pm sharp today.  I told myself on the train that I should be in bed by 10pm tonight, but now that I feel like 10 times worse I think I'm going to change that to 8 or 9.  I hate being sick.  It blows.  Plus you can't breathe for shit. Secondly, this weekend was weird.  Didn't relax as much as I would have liked, but that's to be expected as I wasn't home a lot of the time.  But I did have fun, although the bee sting on Sat def did a lil number on me.  I dunno, I guess I was expecting more out of the weekend of something - like I feel let down almost.  My own fault I know, but the feeling still exists. Rupal is finally back home - it's good to see the chica once again.  Paul is leaving on Friday for Cali - it'll be really sad to see him go.  I'm slowly getting over the initial sadness of his leaving and into the excitement of his new job, but I'll miss my best guy pal.  We've been really good friends for almost 10 yrs.  The bond is pretty stong tho and I don't doubt we will stay in touch.  I'll always love my Paulie =) The roommate situation is STILL in limbo - yeah it bites.  But hopefully I'll know more at the end of the week.   And one last "ugh": my computer will not start.  Everything is plugged in and connected fine, but the CPU will NOT cooperate.  I have no idea why and I have no clue on how to fix it - esp cuz the dang thing won't even start.  I'm annoyed and thinking that I pretty much lost everything once again.  I hate that computer. Oh and one more ugh, I have mosquito bites ALL OVER my body from Saturday.  I HATE them.  I itch like crazy.  And they're on my face (so they look like pimples) and on my neck (so they look like hickeys) and on my legs (so I can barely itch them thru my pants).  Mosquito bites blow.  Today is a crappy day.  =(

      Aaaa!  Baby, I will miss to teeny tiny Robyn pieces all over the place.  I have had *such* a wonderful time living with you... and I can't believe how much we have gotten to hang out as of recent.  Every moment that we say something weird *at the same time* is like the shock of when the twins first meet in the Parent Trap.  Are we clones?  Like Danny DeVito and Schwartenager?  Meep!   I loves you roommate.  I'll miss you too.

      Right when I thought I knew what I would be doing life threw another curveball.  Never settle into a routine I tell you - it will undeniably get disrupted.  At least I'm smiling about it - granted at first I was a lil sad, but the more I think abt it the more used to the idea I become, and the more it feels like an adventure rather than a problem.  Weird how events can take a twist like that.  Good luck Stanish!!  My fingers are crossed for you for both places! =)

      I know I've said that before, but it really truly is weird. I had gone through a slight depression during the month of July (I apologize to those I put through the ringer) and lately there have just been so many things that have made me realize how lucky I am to have certain people in my life. I think actually being happy with the way things are going in life is a horribly new concept to me that I just can't quite grasp all the time. It seems unreal and I'm just sitting here waiting for the other shoe to drop. I know that this feeling can't last: My friends keep leaving; Irina is going back to school far far away and Rupal is leaving the freakin country, and of course I'm still not in school yet [this is a guaranteed downer at times] so I know that everything is not perfect, but there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel lately. I'm not completely sure if it's there, but the closer I get the more I feel it is.  Ahh but isn't that true with everything? Haven't you ever thought you've spotted a friend, only to go up to that person and when you get face-to-face realize that it is not the person you thought? It's almost like seeing that light is what drives people, but it's only a lil firefly or somthing. I dunno, at least the firefly gets you there, and perhaps once you are there you realize you don't need the firefly... Ok yeah I know I'm digressing but it's my blog so I'm allowed to.  Debbie, Johanna and I signed our new lease for next year this week.  It's kind of exciting cuz I actually know where I'm going to be and what I'll be doing for the next year (this NEVER happens!!)  I think we'll get along fine, I just worry abt the furniture thing: Debs has a lot and Jo wants to buy some - and we already have stuff filled.  Ah well, we'll figure it out.  The last party with Ru is this Saturday and honestly I will miss the chica more than I can say. We've grown real close and I'm going to miss our adventures - esp the movie nights we've been having recently: trying to cram all the movies you want to see with one another into one week has been kind of hard, but it rocks - I just need to quit falling asleep!! =(  Perhaps when you get back Ru, we can live together again.  It was an extremely good time.  I luv ya Ru-bear! =)
