       urlLink     Why do you cry?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You are a.. GOTH! You're sick of the wannabe freaks ruining the scene and making your angst seem superficial. You thrive on the darker aspects of life, have an interest in classic literature and poetry, and probably get a kick out of Halloween. ("No.. that's not a costume, dammit!")    urlLink   The Subculture Label Quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    ((^^ha attitude maybe, but clothes.. ::sigh:: i'd say im a prep.. not by choice, u cant really find good "skater/goth" clothes that fit me or cheap enough for me^^))     You are Belle. Intellectual and self assured, you may catch a lot of flack for your disdain for being like every other girl out there. Love, to you, must be something very special to capture your attention, and you are likely to be strong willed and not easily dominated. All the same, family (and this includes close friends) mean the world to you-- you'd walk through fire to help the ones you love, and you have the strength and courage to weather any storm.    urlLink   The ULTIMATE 'Which Disney Princess Are You?' quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        urlLink      urlLink What Name Should You Have?  by  urlLink Lauren       -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla         My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I hung out with Joslyn for a while... she's so confusing tho! First we were gonna go bowling, but it was closed, then we were gonna go to Ohio Skate, but it was closed.. then to a movie, but her mom wouldnt take us there, so we ended up just going to the mall.. it was fun I went with Joslyn and her friend (i think) Jessica.. they got cappachino and i got a hot chocolate, and jessica had to pee really bad, so she gets up and me and joslyn put 2 packets of sugar and 2 packets of sweet-and-low in her drink.. it was funny she didnt notice for a while.. then me and jos started randomly laughing in the car back to her house, and she kept slapping me so i'd slap her back, now i have a little bruise on my leg!! it was fun... i went back to her house and we went out back and her neighbor Josh, his brother, and a few other people were out there playing "baseball"... so we joined, i didnt want to play so i just sat there but they made me hit the ball.. so i barely hit it and just stood there, it was out anyway... i think josh likes me.. cuz he keeps telling me that i have to go over to joslyn's and hang out... and his brother was like "my brother likes you" and i didnt really hear him at first so i was like "what?" and he wouldnt answer me so yeah... idk josh is ok.. i dont think i'd ever like him tho..   I so cant wait for the finch concert July 30.. its gonna be soo much fun.. :) ha.. lots of fun...  PIXIE STICKS haha andrea t knows!!! IT TICKLES lmao nvm
