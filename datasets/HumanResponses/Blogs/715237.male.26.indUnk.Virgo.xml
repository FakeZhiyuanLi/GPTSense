      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE by Jason Latour     Well, it's another late Sunday night—or Monday morning, rather—and I have decided to write, the response to which I understand causes great rejoicing by the Iraqi people. Honestly I mean not to get into all that war talk again, but what doesn't cause the Iraqi people to rejoice anymore? It's like its free chalupa time at Taco Bell everyday, all day, over there now. Well, at least according to CNN, it is. I think what the Iraqi people need right now is some good service-station-brand ripple to celebrate with. I mean honestly, ripple is always cause for cheer—especially strawberry ripple.   Mmmm ripple...  As long as I'm RAMBLING INCOHERENT-ly™, I saw on Bill Mahr a while back that Texas is trying to increase the laws against sodomy in their state—making it punishable by death or something ridiculous like that. For those of you that don't know, "sodomy" is defined as:   "Any of various forms of sexual intercourse held to be unnatural or abnormal, especially anal intercourse or bestiality."  The notion of outlawing sodomy, is in my mind,ridiculous because—honestly—who defines what is deviant and what's not? Some people might think letting the woman get on top or doing it "doggy" style is deviant. Or strapping on a Louisville Slugger and strangling your partner to the sound of Beethoven's Fifth symphony--- honestly, who among us hasn't wanted to donkey punch our lover now and then? It might be rude but it's certainly not illegal or immoral activity in my eyes. Just stay away from the kids and barnyard animals and you're okay in my book, I guess. But that said, I would probably have sex with a cow, if it had a nice ass and some big sexy breasts...  It brings up the age-old question of who defines what is immoral for another? Take for example myself. I'm the ripe old age of 26, which in my new found home of Gainesville, Florida, is looked upon as being about the equvialent of Yoda or that old guy with the booger finger from THE GOLDEN CHILD. Being a 26-year-old man in a town populated by beautiful, sexually ripe 18–21-year-old women is hard on the constitution. It's unbelievable. Now, I used to say, "I'd never touch a high school girl"—which basically the freshmen girls around here still are—but when it's in your face—and I mean literally in your face—man, let's just say the temptation is GREAT. So great that it makes me want to grab a bottle of that aforementioned strawberry ripple and get REALLY REALLY REALLY schnauzelled. Because under the influence, we all know that it's okay to just say that you didn't know. But then you're entering Kobe Bryant territory and no one wants that.   Ah, Kobe. The whole thing is mind-numbingly stupid. I thought he was a giant idiot when I first heard he married a 19-year-old who was fresh out of high school. When you live in a world where fame and popularity determine sex status so mightily that Demi Moore is jumping Aston Kutcher, you just don't marry a 19-year-old girl (no matter how hot she is)! Then to make matters worse, once you get tired of that "old hag" you've got at home, you jump the first preteen beer-tub girl that slants you the sweet eye. And then he either forces her to have sex with him (when we all know that there are millions of hot young women out there who would do it for free) or he just gets way "too" freaky (based on the bruises and missing hairs and such) and she can't take it when he leaves. When you're in the the public eye you just don't do that stuff. My advice to Kobe in the future is: if you can't keep in holstered then follow the lead of our mutual idol, Michael Jordan. Keep it on the DL with older women who know the deal. A 30-year-old basketball groupie isn't running home crying to her parents—no matter what happens. She's two-way paging her girlfriends to brag about the new Benzo she's pushing with the money you fronted her to keep quiet. Now I know this sounds hypocritical coming from me based on what I said earlier, but you have to realize that Kobe and I ain't exactly playing on the same ball field. He's in the majors and I'm slumming in the optimist league.   So, what did we learn today? That if if you're travelling to Texas and you have a pention for sex with underage barnyard life don't be a Kobe—keep it on the down low!

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE By Jason Latour      I have now officially degenerated to full blown slob. I was eating some Tostitos and salsa moments ago when I somehow unexplicably lost all control of my motor functions and dumped a healthy scoop of "Medium All Natural Salsa" onto my t-shirt. Well like any good American, I just tried to scoop it off my shirt with a new chip only to be foiled by a second "salsa foul" as I redumped salsa onto my shirt again. So now I sit shirtless on my couch eating chips and salsa—my hands pathetically stretching crumbs of chips in hopeless vain for that last glob of tomato and pepper paste goodness at the bottom of the jar.   I have come to the realization that no matter how old I get, there is a certain level of slobbery that will always cling to me. Soon physical exercise  and weight lifting will no longer be neccessary. Much like your dad.   It's just something that dad's have. You reach a certain point and its as if you don't need to work out anymore. My dad, for instance, never ever, ever works out. In a weight room I can lift circles around him. BUT when it comes to twisting a bolt off a washer or lifting a home entertainment center, he's a workhorse. That, my friends, is "MAN STRENGTH." When you can twist off a beer cap with your forearm, you have evolved.   I think we men need a revolution in this country. We need more salsa-ridden slobs sitting half naked on their couches watching WILD ON. We need to say that it's okay if I have a little paunch and, no, I don’t need no damn QUEER EYES on this STRAIGHT GUY, thank you very much. I can twist off a beer cap with my forearm and drive a nail through a two-by-four with my face—can you?   Don’t get me wrong I’m all for the sexual revolution of these times. I like that we can all exist peacefully and not (at least in public) be at each other’s throats. But I say we make the normal man the new J-Lo. She made the big ass fashionable in a time when skinny waifs populated the landscape. Let's do the same for those guys out there who maybe have a little too much back hair or just don't quite smell right. Oh, Al Bundy, where are you when we need you?

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE By  Jason Latour      I am broke. Broke as a joke.   Remember those old episodes of DUCK TALES where Uncle Scrooge would swim in his giant vault of money? Well I recall there was an episode where these mole men cause an earthquake and all the sudden Uncle Scrooge had like one coin and it was rolling around on the floor towards this huge crack. This was a man (well a duck) who had once had it all and that was his last gold coin rolling towards certain oblivion and all he could do was lust forward ---reaching in vain as it fell to the center of the earth.   Dear god the humanity of it all.   It pretty much describes what happened to me in Las Vegas this past summer.   I'm just not lucky. There is no way of getting around it. I mean I need Karma lessons or something because I play the odds the best way you can and I still lose. Now don't get me wrong---I'm not hating on Vegas. I LOVE the place. But it kicks my ass.   I guess the appeal, whatREALLY makes Vegas so great, is that it's just about the only place in this country where almost ANYTHING and EVERYTHING goes. It's a place where anyone with a couple hundred bucks in their pocket can blow off steam doing things that they would get arrested for in Smallville, Kansas. Though as much fun as I have there on my meager budget--- I can only imagine how it would be if I were rich.   Though if you’re rich, I mean REALLY rich, I guess you don’t need Vegas. You can do pretty much anything you want anyway. Which is my THEORY on why rich people are usually so weird—it’s because they’re bored. When you can afford to finally get that swimming pool full of Coca-Cola you wanted as a kid it changes you in really strange ways. It’s like some sort of super marijuana high that just kills all ambition and reason.  But of course that wouldn’t be a problem for me because you see---I have imagination.   For example I would make people climb poles for my amusement---at threat of death or beatings. Now how is that legal or even fun you might ask? Well we’re speaking of rich people here so what’s legal isn’t really an issue. Besides, the Japanese have game shows that are close to the things I'm proposing already. It might seem stupid or lacking in the fun department but unless you’ve ever SEEN a fat guy or a midget climb a pole you just don't understand. The key is you have to to sweeten the deal for the contestants—put a prize at the top, like a gift certificate or a steak or a loved one hanging on for dear life. Imagine the side bets.  See sounds funner than you thought.  Of course gambling with human life isn't the only perk of the super rich---you get to date super models. Though even then you always get tired and all uppity and self-righteous and start having these ungoldly high standards about the women you should date. You start actually expecting your super model girlfriend to not only have perfect breasts but now she’s got to a Yale grad. And it’s not that this girl isn’t out there but trust me she’s harder to find that WALDO when you’re tripping on acid. So my question to the uppity rich is why stop there? As long as this is fantasy perfection, why not find other perfect combinations of women. Say, a  different supermodel for every household task. I'd have a cook-model and a vacuuming-model and a dusting model---a gutter cleaning model--one to clean my collection of model porn. Ah it would just be a misogynistic heaven wouldn't it? Isn't that a dream that we can all get behind? I know I can.   So I guess the point is that I’m glad I get to go to Vegas every year and loose money. Gambling is the everyman’s vice. It’s risky and fun and on the edge without going too far. Sure I could save my money and invest wisely so I could have a better shot at being rich someday, but if being rich means that I have to start getting jacked up on cocaine and Viagra while watching men fight to the death in Thailand to get my kicks----then I just don’t think its for me.

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE by Jason Latour      In a shocking turn of events, pop sensation Britney Spears has been forced to cancel her summer tour due to a knee injury sustained on the set of her latest video shoot with rapper Calvin Broadus aka Snoop Dogg.   "Yeah, I guess she just tried to bust a move and slipped.....slipped on this DEE-IACK!" said Mr. Broadus.    The move will force fantasy owners to scramble for a replacement as Spears was second in the league only to Beyonce' Knowles in AGPS (ass giggle per second)and first in BIYF (boobs in your face). Owners should consider trading for another star with a comprable slut to innocence ratio such as Jessica Simpson, Jessica Alba or Nancy Reagan.

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE by Jason Latour      Tonight was truly a night to remember as Rasheed Wallace and the Detroit Pistons crushed the Los Angeles Lakers 100-87 to win the NBA Finals 4 games to 1.   It wasn't even close.   The Pistons stifling defense made Kobe and Shaq look very human, Gary Payton look like an idiot and Karl Malone look washed up.   And I for one loved every minute of it.   Yes ladies and gentlemen, I did indeed pick the Pistons over the Lakers, though as you might expect I didn't think it was going to be this easy.   Granted I enjoy rooting against them, it makes the game fun. In fact with the possible exception of the Dallas Cowboys, they might be my favorite team ever to pull against. But that said I can't say I'm not glad to see them go.   Next year will bring a much different Lakers squad in my estimation. Leaving us with the question "what happens to this current bunch of Laker superstars?"   Phil Jackson will ride off into the sunset, to smoke peyote on his ranch and go on dreamquests with naked indian shaman until of course another job like say coaching Lebron James or the Dream Team opens up in five or six years. He'll return to the court in Dalhi Lama gear, head shaven, dressed a pink robe, only to discover that Cleveland is no Shangri La and that Drew Carey doesn't really live there anymore.   Kobe will go to prison, not for rape but in a stroke most egomanical-- for sodomizing himself . He will lead the prison league in scoring average for two seasons before being released back into civilization. He will then renounce basketball and his former life and start a religion known as "Kobe-ism" where the central belief is that "one must shoot---one must always shoot".   Shaq...well Shaq will continue to grow, soon eclipsing our sun. This will force our government to propel him into space, where he will roam the universe in search of barren planets to feed on and quench his "Shaq-sized hunger".   Karl Malone will return to Lousiana, move to the bayou and begin a successful career running "shine". He and his pet possum "Cheeto" will become the most feared and wanted shine smugglers since Burt Reynolds played the Bandit.   Gary Payton will replace Rush Limbaugh as talk radio's number one shock jock. His levels of stupidity and egomania will force FCC regulations prohibiting him from referring to himself in the third person---a move which will eventually cause his head to explode.   Luke Walton will forgo a lucrative NBA future and move back in with his parents where he will be submitted to the daily ridicule of playing his father, Bill, in one on one matches. After a decade of studying the technique of delivering severe razor sharp elbows to the face and fused ankle pivot moves he will return to the NBA and win an NBA title, fufilling his destiny.   And all will be right with the world.

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE Seed of the Future By Jason Latour    Disclaimer: The following article is from a message board post I made on my fantasy baseball league message boards. Jason Ollman, Trey Flynn, Jason Wolf etc. are good friends of mine. If you've never seen Jon Maynard's Tron suit website you should  urlLink check it out here.  But I warn you it will make you want to claw your own eyes out. This post was so insanely stupid I just thought it would be fun to post here. Enjoy.    SEED OF THE FUTURE!     Dateline- Gainesville, FL   After a harrowing journey through time and space Space Semen First Class Jason “Jingles” Ollman Jr. is happy to return to the loving bosom of his parents---Jason Ollman and Joseph “Trey” Flynn of Gainesville, FL.   Appearing in a flash of light and heat, the “One true, sperm warrior Tronite” arrived late last evening, interrupting the first quarter of Detroit’s victory over the L.A. Lakers with his blindingly horrid visage.   This strange visitor from another era offered his would be parents a vague but telling explanation of his origins:   “I come from the year 2040, seeking refuge, an outcast from society due to my perfect combination of your horrible, horrible genetic flaws!”   “I now return to the bosom of love that once bore my putrid soul! Take in me and drink of my stench!” cried the geekily clad freak.   Bystanders were then horrified as the three exchanged a heartfelt embrace, which may or may not have included some ass fingering.   “It doesn’t really surprise me,” said Jason Latour. “No, no shock at all. Makes complete sense. He looks exactly like I’d picture him. A horrific freak.”   “If my boy came out looking like that…I’d have to take him out back and put him down,” commented Jason Wolf.   Then greeting his parents a final farewell, this cosmic visitor from the unknown waddled back into his time pod, preparing for a return to his home.   “I now return to my time, relieved to now know that my parents are indeed the reason for my infinitesimal success and lifelong virginity. I am now content to live out my remaining years as head chef at Steak and Shake 2040, where the burgers are always greasy and the chances of success are gloomy. Farewell parental units, may you soon achieve my procreation, either through the miracle of your primitive science or through the force of your combined ass loving.”

      Rambling Incoherence By Jason Latour      A while back I got one of those head set thingies for my cell phone, the goal being to cut down on the cancerous radiation leaking into my brain. Fast forward to today, I have the ear piece thing in so that the deadly cancerous cell phone isn't next to my head, but I look down and low and behold my phone is sitting in my lap---right over my, well  "my boys".   Is that Darwinism at work or what?   What do you choose in that situation? Your brain or your "boys"? Do you wanna be a drooling freak with functional genitalia or still be able to form coherent sentences yet impotent?   It's quite the dilemma.   Though if you think about it cell phones are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the scary stuff that’s out there. These days you’ve got the West Nile and the Mad Cow and a list of STD’s longer than Yao Ming’s arm. The world is a scary, scary place and I think that mysterious cell phone radiation is probably not a viable concern--- at least I hope.  Still it makes one yearn for the good old days of my father’s generation where you could screw a Vietnamese hooker and, if it burned afterwards, that was a sign that you were still alive?

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE by Jason Latour   Time for something a little different today. No straight up jokes. Just a good old "whats on my mind" type blog.     Uconn's Emeka Okafor   So tomorrow (well technically today by the time of this post)is the 2004 NBA draft. A date which for many of you I'm sure is circled on your calendars as you hold your breath in anticipation, hoping that Pavel Podkolzine falls into your teams lap. For the expansion Charlotte Bobcats, which I guess is now my hometown team though I don't live there anymore, it is the inaugural draft. A day where possibly, but not likely, the entire future of the franchise could be forged. So in keeping with this theme, I was watching ESPN and their preview coverage of the  forthcoming draft and the big debate is whether Orlando, who holds the number one selection, should take former UCONN big man and  College national player of the year Emeka Okafor or high school "phenom" Dwight Howard. This is of utmost importance to the Bobcats because they hold the second pick and will likely take whichever of the two Orlando doesn't.     Dwight Howard    Okay cut to the chase, so I'm watching the coverage on ESPN and they begin to interview Dwight Howard. Seems like a good kid all and all, I'm not sure I don't know him. But something about him irks me. He begins to talk about his religion, which I don't care to hear personally. Religion to me is best left out of sports, its a personal experience that has nothing to do with how many points you scored or TDs you threw. It would be like if someone went to work everyday and told you about the bible verses he read last night in the morning meetings. But the thing that bothered me the most about this was that the kid was talking about how he has stopped listening to "all music but gospel" and stopped doing most anything not related to scripture due to his beliefs. Look fine, okay I respect that you want to be a good person and you're entitled to your beliefs but when you're 18 I just don't think its wise to cut yourself off to life experience (which I consider the art forms of music and film,etc. to be a big part of) like that before you've had a chance to form your world view. A small thing to get upset about I know but the clincher was when asked about his acting ability he mentions an aptitude for impressions, then offers up a scene featuring Debo from the movie FRIDAY. Thats right FRIDAY*. Praise Jesus Smokey.     *I love the movie FRIDAY.     Maybe the kid will grow and become more open minded. I hate to paint him as close minded not knowing him or more about him but it just kind of bothered me. I guess most of were different at 18 than we are now. Hopefully if he comes here he'll be a great player and a great citizen and I know he won't have much trouble finding bible studies to attend here in the "bible belt".   Personally I can't decide between the two, I prefer Okafor on a personal level but given that we more than likely won't be in contention for a few years it might work out if Howard falls into our lap. With Okafor and the plan of "fiscal responsibility" (aka tight waddedness) that owner Bob Johnson has laid out, I can see a scenario developing where Okafor stays on our team just long enough to get good, we do terrible and he bolts for a big market pay day. I hope I'm wrong.   Hey at least I'm not and Orlando fan and in my buddy  urlLink Trey's shoes    In other news, my comic book reading "geekness" continues. Which I guess is balanced out by that lengthy sports rant above. I recently have been dropping a lot of the books I read, in some cases out of lack of funds to continue purchasing them regularly and in other cases just sheer boredom. I'm down to basically the following regular titles  urlLink 100 BULLETS,  SLEEPER, DAREDEVIL and I think now a title that will become the surprise entry....wait for it....freaking AQUAMAN.   Yeah you heard me.   Freaking I talk to fish and swim under-freaking-water AQUAMAN.    urlLink        click for full image   But in all seriousness, I always thought it would take a really good story to get me to read a regular freaking AQUAMAN title and I think I've found it. The current arc is moving the character, who quite frankly always seemed either useless or out of context compared to his contemporaries (not to mention rather silly), into a much more relatable and interesting context.    urlLink   click for full image    Writer Will Pfiefer has set up a story arc in which the city of San Diego as fallen into the ocean (either by tidal wave or an earthquake, I missed the first couple of issues). Well as it turns out there are survivors, who somehow are now endowed with the ability to live under water but no longer out of it. As a result freaking Aquaman decides to look out for the safety of these people who are now a society of "fish out of water", all the while searching for the answers to their mysterious metamorphosis. This to me is a nice stroke by Pfiefer in that it puts freaking Aquaman into a context where the stories can still retain a fantasy element but at the same time make the environment somewhat relatable to readers (certainly more so than Atlantis).   urlLink    click for preview    I imagine in the future the new SD will be a new sort of "kingdom" for freaking Aquaman, allowing him to be more of a cop/mayor than an out and out king. A nice story so far, at least enough to get my attention and if nothing else Patrick Gleason's art is pretty nifty, reminiscent of another fav Doug Mahnke. Hopefully it will continue to hold my interest and make an interesting character out of something that's been on the fringe of lame for quite sometime.      Freaking Aquaman.

      RAMBLING INCOHERENCE  by Jason Latour   Disturbing, disturbing news out of Hollweird as Matrix co-creator Larry Wachowski has aparently opted undergo a sex change. No I'm not making this up:    'Matrix' co-creator ready for sex change azcentral.com April 30, 2004  When you're touted as one-half of the creative genius behind the science fiction movie of the decade, morphing between the sexes is probably just another research trip. At least that is one way to describe Larry Wachowski latest move.   According to the Chicago Sun Times, Wachowski, who created the Matrix series along with his brother Andy, is working toward becoming "Linda," surgically and otherwise. "As always, it was impossible to get any comment from the press-shy Wachowskis, but several longtime friends of the Rogers Park native confirm Wachowski is planning to complete the process of becoming a woman," reports the Chicago Sun Times.  When Thea Bloom, Larry's former wife, accused Wachowski of being "extremely dishonest with me in our personal life," blaming the separation on "very intimate circumstances concerning which I do not elaborate at this time for the reasons of his personal privacy," a sex change wasn't the first thing to come to mind. But those close to Larry relate the he has been "living and dressing as a woman for some time."   Talk about there is no spoon.

      Rambling Incoherence  By Jason Latour   Well is seems in the end it was much ado about nothing as far as the Los Angeles Lakers courtship of Duke University head basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski was concerned. In the end Coach K decided to stay in Durham, opting not to take the $40 million dollar deal that the Lakers reportedly laid on the table .     Coach K with Sweaty Robin, the Ultimate Duke 'tard.      Being a UNC Tarheels fan I have to say that the news doesn't really affect me in the way you might think it would. Given Duke's dominance in the UNC rivalry the past few years (yeah I admitted it, at least in the win column) you would think I would want the guy to go. But no in a lot of ways I think that a strong Duke team benefits Carolina much more than a weak one. The rivalry is a great draw for recruiting and on a personal level I don't want to hear any excuses about Coach K being gone when the Tar heels return to form (as they are expected to these next couple of years).   No, what has me more upset is the way all this is being handled by the media. In particular the latest story of how a lowly Duke student was able to convince Coach K to stay at Duke with a letter  he wrote that bascially went---  "Dear Coach K, please stay at Duke. I once dreamed for so long about being a Duke player but given my one inch vertical and lack of opposable thumbs I soon realized it was a dream never to be. However I knew that by going to Duke I had an opportunity to be something greater than the neuro surgeon or third world dictator that my parents hoped sending me there would accomplish, I knew that  you would now be  my coach and I would become your most glorious sixth man.  I could cheer you on with all my heart as a coated my flabby body with blue lead based paint and cheered away until my throat was sorer than Jenna Jameson at the end of a long shoot. (Insert continued verbal mastrubation here). The end."   Please.   Lets be honest here, that godawful, sappy letter had little to no real sway over this decision. This came down to one thing---Coack K using the Lakers to get what he wanted, which was to stay at Duke and to get the adminstration to take notice that he is as coveted as a coach as he thinks he is. I guarantee you Coach K will , smartly, use this as a bargaining chip to get a bigger pay raise at some point down the line. Don't get me wrong, I think he did the right thing in staying but the way everyone is playing it up like he's a saint for doing so is ridiculous and the fact that people actually think this goofball who wrote the letter saved Duke Basketball is fucking retarded.   There honestly was no real choice here. Stay at Duke where you are a certain hall of famer and guaranteed an untarnished legacy that will stand for generations? Or risk a year in L.A. where you've got a team full of egos run amok with more bad drama than a daily soap? Add in the fact that there may have been the possiblity of him coaching a Lakers team sans Kobe and Shaq. Honestly people its not rocket science.     So please spare me the heart wrenching cotton candy B.S. about how some goofy looking kid in stain defender dockers saved Duke basketball I get enough propaganda from FOX NEWS.    PS If someone has a copy of the real letter please forward it my way.

      Rambling Incoherence The Godfather     Marlon Brando 1924-2004  On a slightly serious note:    This July 4th weekend marked the passing of one of the worlds more famous, most enigmatic and perhaps most talented actors as Marlon Brando died of lung cancer at the age of 80. Like many of us, upon hearing of his death I naturally found myself reflecting upon what I knew of his career and of the man himself.     Brando as Jor-El in SUPERMAN the movie.      As a kid I had my first and perhaps most memorable taste of his work as he portrayed Jor-El in the movie “Superman”, certainly not his most famous role but one that connected with my obsession with comic books and in retrospect an unbelievably apt casting choice. It was much later that  I encountered his work as the titular role in “The Godfather” and as Kurtz in “Apocalypse Now” and was startled at his breadth as an actor. And though while I could recognize the skill and ability he clearly possessed, it was more likely the choice of these roles, the sheer outlandishness (especially in “Apocalypse”) and the inherent comedy in that outlandishness that endeared Brando to me the most. I soon learned that this outlandish behavior carried over into the real world, that people regarded Brando as a talented yet off kilter celebrity who had, much like Kurtz in “Apocalypse Now”, left the “real” world long ago. And while this seemed to be the prevailing public opinion, I personally knew little about the real reason’s why he was considered such an aloof and eccentric personality.  I had heard of his son’s murder trial, of his outspoken activism and of his fondness for food and women but I still had no real basis as to where it all came from. His self-imposed isolation seemed odd given his life of renown and fame. Was he simply as he seemed; the poster boy for celebrity gone AWOL? Or was there more to it? The answer intrigues me to this day.     Brando as Kurtz....crazy...like a fox.    Tonight I was fortunate enough to catch an airing of “A&E’s Biography” which helped to shed some light into his life. I was able to see the events of his life in some sort of context and what I took away has in many ways changed my opinion about him. To me Brando seemed like a man who was very much driven by passions and desires that he could not articulate in any conventional means. After viewing the episode I would have to, in my limited knowledge, conclude that the passing of his mother, his struggles love and with his children all seem to mold his odd behavior and by someway form the indulgences and eccentricities that were outlets for his energy. He seemed very much a man who was blessed and cursed with the gift of being special. I think in someway he was searching for answers in his work, something that I can truly relate to. This seems never more evident than in his portrayal of Kurtz in “Apocalypse Now” a role that seems to mirror his own life. A man who steps out of our society and retreats to a faraway land (in this case Vietnam) where he is king of his own private world populated by unspoiled natives. It is oddly reflective of Brando’s purchase of a Tahitian island and subsequent expatriation in the sixties and perhaps very telling of the man himself.   In the wake of his passing there as been the expected media circus, as questions abound about his last days. Rumors that upon his death he owed in excess of 20 million dollars to debtors. I find it interesting that people must now, having truly known so little about him, grasp at straws in their search to find the “real” Marlon Brando. If anything his death should influence us to look past his obvious flaws and instead  revisit his work and take in films we may have overlooked in the past and reflect on what he left behind.

      Rambling Incoherence  By Jason Latour   From CNN.com: LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Screen legend Elizabeth Taylor is fighting a family's claims that a Vincent van Gogh painting she owns was taken from one of their ancestors by Nazis.      Taylor, whose father bought her the painting at a London auction in 1963, has filed a lawsuit seeking a pre-emptive court declaration that she is the rightful owner of the painting, which hangs in the living room of her Bel-Air estate.  In a statement issued last month, Taylor said she has "a tremendous amount of sympathy" for those who lost possessions during World War II and the Holocaust. She said she told her lawyers to thoroughly investigate the ownership history of the 115-year-old van Gogh.   urlLink READ FULL ARTICLE HERE   Just a little commentary on this one:   Sweet Christ let the painting go. Assuming that these claims are remotely valid it makes this thing one of the most ridiculously greedy things I've ever seen. "I'm sorry your family endured horrific torture at the hands of a genocidal madman but the Van Gogh looks great above my couch."   -J La

      Rambling Incoherence  by Jason Latour   Once again another July 4th has come and gone and I for one must interject that it was once again pretty much a disappointment. As holidays go I would rate the 4th behind New Years and Valentines day for holidays with the least actual follow through on the hype. It's a great idea and all but when it comes down to it Independence Day is the Star Wars Episode One of holidays, all flash and hype---little to no pay off.   To me all the build up of waiting around for hours just to watch fireworks has the same allure of a NASCAR race. "Hot damn Honey! I cain't wait ta watch sumthin' 'splode!"   That's not to say that it's a totally worthless day, oh by no means. Any excuse to take the day off and drink yourself into a stupor is certainly much better than your average weekday, by default making it worthy of a holiday. Hell, if it were up to me we'd all be smashed drinking pine sap beer on Arbor Day.It just seems like every 4th of July people have to work the next day, so by the time the party's starting it's ending. Then you've got a totally good buzz wasted over nothing.  And of course there is the food so thats not bad. Yeah I have no problem eating BBQ.  Damn I had to mention BBQ ribs. Ruins my whole argument.   Blasted delicious ribs.   -J La

      Two quick tidbits of humor today.   First off, You have to love these fanfiction movie trailers.   www.theforce.net/theater/nonsw/worldsfinest/   I kept laughing because it looked like it was directed by Buster Gonads. Straight up porn style actors,costumes and lighting.   I just find it funny that these guys spend all this time and energy working on stuff like this. Why not put it to use on something of your own? I mean I guess it's kind of cool in the fact that they love the stuff so much but it's also just a little sad.   I just goes to show you how damn awesome Christopher Reeve was to pull off that costume. These muscle bound clods that everyone tries to use always look horrible.   And from CNN comes this latest brain fart by our presidente':  And hopefully, Bush won't use his new line, spoken at a White House bill signing yesterday. "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."   The only think I'm gonna miss about Bush is marveling in his uncanny ability to put his foot in his mouth.   -J La

      Rambling Incoherence  by Jason Latour   Anyone who knows me knows that Batman is one of my favorite characters/concepts in superhero comics. I'm certainly not alone in this one, I mean he is one of the most popular characters around. I recently stumbled upon something I found pretty cool (which I'm sure boosts me well into the UBER GEEK category and expunges the equity I'd built up from the "regular world" with the thirty or so sports posts I've made in this blog), it's a short essay that archives the number of people Batman has killed viciously since his creation by Bob Kane back in the thirties. The interesting thing is how the modern Batman we all know and love is pretty much considered to be a paradigm of justice, someone who cherishes life first and foremost and believes in second chances. I'm not saying this modern version is completely flawed, seeing as that I believe in many of those things myself, but damn this old style bad ass Batman was cool! It just goes to show how quickly things change when a character suddenly becomes a "property".   Enjoy:   "Batman's Body Count   By Ray Tate   I've always felt the Punisher, not the original but the remake, was something of a wuss, and rereading the Dark Knight Archives supports my opinion. Batman in his early days made the Punisher look like a bleeding heart and something of an amateurish boob. The Punisher is the poster child for the NRA. Batman used guns to kill only once. He instead preferred to slay his foes through brute strength. Observe, and be amazed at his astounding knack for execution.  In Detective Comics #27, his debut, Batman breaks a thug's neck with a "deadly headlock" then tosses the body over his shoulder and onto a rooftop. Following this incident, Batman with a solid left cross whacks Styles, and in anticipation of the 1989 Batman movie, the murderer falls into an acid vat. Batman does not lift a finger to save him. Instead, he chills with the line: "A fitting end to his kind."  In Detective Comics #28, a fool attempts to knife Batman who briskly hoists him over the roof and to the welcoming concrete below.  In Detective Comics #29, he snaps the neck of Jabah, Dr. Death's goon. In a later scene you can still see Jabah's cooling on the floor.  Doctor Death returns in Detective Comics #30 with a brand new goon who finds his neck broken beneath Batman's boot. Batman really liked to break necks in the old days.  For the next two issues, Batman battles against, even when judged today, one of his weirdest foes. The Monk was half-vampire/half-werewolf and perhaps the first creature of mixed heritage apart from Hercules to appear in comic books. I think he even beat out Aquaman and Namor. Using silver bullets and a .45 Smith and Weson automatic Batman dispatches the Monk and Dala his female vampire servant. They were already dead, and technically they don't add to Batman's impressive scorecard. I mention them only for archivists. Though, he does not even question whether or not they are alive or dead. You can easily make the argument that both Angel and Spike are alive, but this Batman was more pragmatic than philosophical and in many ways more pure in his quest to eradicate crime, avenge his parents and prevent others to suffer his loss.  In Detective Comics #33, Batman destroys the dirigible of a would-be Hitler named Krueger. I don't actually know how many men were on the airship nor is the number indicated, but the range must be at least between ten to twenty even when accounting for science fiction additions to the design of the craft. As an encore, Batman tosses a knock-out pellet from his utility belt into the cockpit of Krueger's escape-plane. Just one for the big brain. No more escape planes nor politically correct parachutes. No survivors. Batman got them all. Kruger, now unconscious, smashes his plane into the river, and "the body of Krueger was recovered from the water."  In Detective Comics #34, Batman chokes Duc Docteru--there's that predilection for necks--then lets his car fly off the cliff. Crispy.  In Detective Comics #35, Batman propels a swordsman onto his partner's sword. Batman then throws a statue at the mastermind to knock him out the window. Naturally, you think perhaps a flagpole or a copse of trees broke his fall. Ha-Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! We see blood pouring out his cracked skull in the next panel.  Think Robin's arrival lightened the Darker Knight's demeanor? Think again. Robin actually is no angel. His slingshot has done more than simply knock out his foes. Batman and Robin during the Boy Wonder's introduction in fact calmly watch Boss Zucco toss one of his men off a girder at a mob bought construction site. Robin even takes a snapshot. One for the police and one to pin to his wall. I made that last bit up. Robin didn't pin the photograph to his wall. He probably kept it in his wallet.  In Detective #39, Batman pushes a giant jade idol and a heavy throne onto six, count them, six members of the Tong of the Green Dragon.   Not at all afraid of repetition, Batman uses a heavy marble statue to kill three of the Joker's men. The Joker incidentally miraculously escaped a car crash that the Batman tried to orchestrate. Hey, cut the guy some slack. Batman probably single-handedly killed every mobster in Gotham City. Perhaps, he greeted any newcomers at the train depot and snapped their neck.  In Detective Comics #47, Batman whacks a hood over the head and lets him plow his car into a phone pole. What I believe to be Batman's final act of killing occurs in a classic battle against Hugo Strange. Batman after slipping a noose around the neck--the neck again--over one of Strange's Monster Men whisks the poor creature off the ground and uses the machine gun mounted on the Bat-Plane to riddle him with bullets. It should be noted that this is the only death over which Batman has felt any sorrow. His thoughts aloud went something like this: "It saddens me to take an innocent human life, but in this case, I have no choice." It should also be noted that his thoughts do not contradict his previous characterization. Simply put, criminals are not innocent, and I doubt the original Batman envisioned by Bob Kane and Bill Finger believed they were even marginally human. The Punisher? More like the Pussycat."

      Rambling Incoherence By Jason Latour       Oh where have you gone MJ?     Once again the Summer Olympics are upon us and as usual the only sport I really care about is basketball. Yeah Gymnastics and High Diving and competitive muff diving are great and all but basketball is the only sport that really grabs my interest.   The reasons are pretty obvious. Basketball is my favorite sport (next to football). I also possess a vast knowledge (hey that’s debatable I agree) of the sport and of the players themselves. And third there are no judges, usually pale and gauntly thin psuedo-erudites feigning interest as they flip through an East Latvian porno mag and try not to ash on their designer silk Capri pants.   Watching the original DREAM TEAM (the first US team featuring pro players and comprised of such legends as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley) run through the other countries like a young Hugh Hefner at a sorority house, using and abusing them in every orifice and position, was one of the highlights of my young life.  It was truly amazing to watch, as other teams seemed more interested in taking photos with our team than actually trying to compete against them.   Lately though our guys (being the US, and the NBA players in particular) have pretty much fallen flat on their collectively rich asses. It's a disturbing and harsh reality that the rest of the world has truly leveled the playing field, as evidenced by our disastrous performance in the World Championships two years ago, our 17 point loss to Italy (friggin' ITALY!) yesterday and our 3 point win over Germany at the buzzer today.   Let me say that again. It took a 3-point prayer at the buzzer by Allen Iverson to beat GERMANY! Germany, a team that hasn't even qualified for the Olympics yet. FREAKING GERMANY, with it's great international stars like former Tar Heel Ademola Okulaja and The Baron Helmut Von Zemo! (Yeah I know they have NBA Allstar Dirk Nowitzki)   Christ, we had an easier time with NAZI Germany.   Of course as always excuses abound. There is a laundry list of NBA superstars such as Shaq, Kobe, KG, etc. who turned down the team. We don't have the time to gel like other teams. We have to go to play in countries where they use the metric system.   Bill Simmons, a writer for ESPN and Jimmy Kimmel recently wrote an article about this subject that I think pretty much sums up how I feel about it all. You can read it here:   http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/040804  Over the course of which he outlines the team he would have assembled for the Olympics. Though I find both his reasoning and selection process pretty solid, I still don’t know that I really agree with his team. Here is my “dream” team, selected with the though that the guys who turned down Team USA would still do so.   HEAD COACH –  Larry Brown- Best coach around period. Just give him something to work with and it’s a cakewalk. Let him pick his own assistants, I’m sure he knows better than I.   STARTERS G-Dwayne Wade-Selected on pure talent. A stud superstar in the making. Plus he’s able to penetrate and finish better and stronger than most of the other guys available.  G-Richard Hamilton – Selected with the same caveat as Simmons that he would have accepted had he been asked earlier. A winner and perfect team player who possesses the best mid range game around, he would destroy any zone defense and run wild under international rules  F- Michael Jeffery Jordan- Ahhh the curve ball. Yeah here is where I go out there a little bit. A last hurrah for MJ. The greatest player of all time would still be able to lace them up and go out and compete with the best of them, let alone international players. Sure he can’t play all the minutes you’d like but he brings an intimidating presence to the court along with an amazing inherent knowledge of what to do on the court under any situation. His mid range shooting and post game would terrorize opponents. The other teams would be so busy either drooling over meeting him or wanting to best him that it would open up countless opportunities for the other guys.   F-Tim Duncan- MVP candidate year in year out. Champion. ‘Nuff said.   C-Rasheed Wallace- Since Ben Wallace turned down the team; why not get his running mate? Right at 7 feet, he's a great shot blocker and shooter who has a Euro’s touch and a street baller’s toughness. Sure he has attitude, but after playing for Larry Brown and winning a championship, its been proven that he can sacrifice for the good of the team.   BENCH  F Antawn Jamison- Sort of a tweener, but a guy who hustles and possesses all the intangibles. He can score in bunches without having plays ran for him and likes to rebound.   G/F- Michael Redd- Like Simmons I take this guy for his shooting if nothing else. Everything else he brings, which is a lot, is just butter.   F-Robert Horry- One word- clutch. A proven winner who rises his game when it counts. Provides passing, shot blocking, outside shooting, leadership and experience. Doesn't need to play or touch the ball but when he does he's definitely a threat.  G/F- Ron Artest- A mad dog on defense who chews metal and spits nails. Above average offensive skills and shooting ability. Only question is attitude, something that surrounding him good teammates and coaching eases that worry.   G-Lebron James- Plays multiple positions. Ridiculously talented. Unselfish and willing to be coached. Plus it doesn’t hurt that he is Lebron friggin’ James.   C-Brad Miller- A banger. A winner. A dirt dog on the boards. He would bring toughness and heart to a team needing it.   G. Richard Jefferson- A world class athlete, a winner and a guy I just like.   G – Chauncey Billups.- A great team player, a winner and a point guard who can slash, shoot and defend. Makes the cut above Sam Cassell due to his youth.   ALTERNATES   Carmelo Anthony- Another young stud superstar on the rise. Unfortunately there are just too many people at his position.   Sam Cassell- Again, a proven winner who can run the offense and score in bunches. Wouldn’t need to play a lot of minutes, but could provide tons of experience and saavy.   Wally Szczerbiak- As much as I bash the guy, he is one of the only pure shooters available. So long as he’s not counted on to score he could ease the load on the big guys by opening up sagging defenses.   Now I realize there are some holes on this team. We’re sacrificing 3 point shooting for mid-range ability, but with guys like Duncan, Wallace and Jordan who can all produce down low and a shorter three point line, you’d get a lot more wide open looks and you need guys willing to step in and take the easier shot as opposed to throwing one up wildly. There is also the lack of a true point guard, but hell outside of college you generally run into that problem in American hoops.   Anyways that’s my rant. I haven’t given up hope on our current team. I think they can still win it, which speaks more to my faith in Larry Brown than anything else. I do think the egos aren’t so great on this team and with some time to work out the kinks they could possibly become a force.   I just pray I don’t have to witness the sickening site of our guys piling on after hanging on to a 1 point win over Botswana.

      Rambling Incoherence  By Jason Latour      OFFICE SPACE was REALLY on to something.    In an effort to swing this blog a little more into a free for all of Rambling topics and not just the typical tirade of bad comedy that it normal it is, allow me to wax philosophical for a moment.  It is official.  I’m back in the “Real World”.   That’s right no more hanging out on college campuses, stalking women decades my junior. I have officially withdrawn from grad school and am in the process of transitioning my life back to that of a “normal” 26-year-old adult.   Well---as normal as you can be for a cartoonist/writer/aspiring filmmaker with no job.   Not that I’m really concerned. You see the past 2 years or so I’ve managed to get by on some strange combination of luck, inventiveness and raw desperation and over the course of that time I’ve realized one thing---  Work is for suckas.  That’s been my credo for a while. But before you go jumping to conclusions, let me explain it.   Work, at least in the traditional sense of a nine to five, mindless drudgery where one just shows up in order to live check to check, is for suckas.     Honestly, I recommend to anyone and everyone---unless you truly love what you do---quit your day job. Yes that job that is dragging your soul down into the pits of depression and anxiety and wasted potential. Junk that bitch with a quickness.   I want you to realize something; I am in no way condoning just sitting on your ass the rest of your life and doing nothing. In fact I personally very much value  and respect hard work and sweat and study. So no I'm not suggesting you sit on your ass, collect unemployment and watch Dave Chapelle all day (though it is a GREAT show). I'm suggesting that you find what it is that you have a passion for and seek to make THAT your occupation.   Yeah I know that this sounds all cheesy and inspirational and from me  (a guy who has I guess achieved very little in the traditional sense) it might not hold much water, but I truly believe it’s the only way to true happiness. Sure it’s a pretty idealist and straightforward way to look at it. You’re right it is odd to hear this speech from my typically cynical ass. And yes, for some it’s a much easier road to hoe, but I think the rewards, no matter how tough they are to achieve, usually outweigh the risks.   For a long time I did a comic strip called 4 Seats Left (www.4seatsleft.com when it was up and running). But in the past year or so I’ve sort of abandoned it. Moved my passions on to other pursuits, other interests—writing, etc. Over that time I’ve often wondered why I felt unable to connect with the characters, why I felt unable to write it anymore? Had I simply outgrown it?   You see the main character, Bernie, is basically worthless. Middle twenties, lives at home, no job, no ambition, just a life of ease. But see that’s is all just parody. Parody of the way I feel on those mornings when I get up and feel that I’m a long ways away from what I’m aiming for. And maybe on some level that’s why I stepped away from the strip for a while, because I felt that the character (who was lets face it based on my “dark” side) didn’t reflect me anymore. But now I realize that Bernie is what he always has been, and that is a parody, a coping device for looking at myself objectively at that lack of drive and that complacency, which is really just insecurity, that most artists of any kind feel. And a way for me get that out into the world, have a chuckle about it and then get myself going again.   And in some ways this blog is a lot like that too. All my work reflects some sort of aspect of my personality and I think I’m beginning, after a long time, to understand that.   So find that thing that you’re good at, that you have an aptitude and passion for, and DO IT. It could be becoming a racecar driver, an artist, a doctor, a lawyer, a world dictator, a porn fluffer, it doesn’t matter. Do it. Even if it just starts out as a hobby, because I promise over the course of it you will learn more about yourself than you ever thought.   So maybe it’s not “Work is for suckas” that is my credo.  Maybe it’s merely “A day job is for suckas”
