      I live and work by the beach in the Bay in Northern California. Originally from the South I had this preconceived notion that coastal living was, well, awesome - hot all of the time with the warmest water imaginable.   HA!  Someone forgot to inform me that the water temperature drops as you live further up North and that the Pacific Ocean isn't nearly as balmy as the Atlantic. Duh.  Uh, and can we please talk about the fog? Horrid little overcast that can last for hours on end. It's the coast! It's suppose to be sunny. Was Baywatch a lie?  (Not that I ever watched Baywatch, mind you.)   Fog, water temperature at 54 degrees, not exactly the sunny California I was hoping for. It's definitely not OC.   Unbelievable.

      Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know, I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me, the way girls play, it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground, just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast, so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves, with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football, without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes, Virg, I'm talking about you, and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar, Virg hung onto her breast, to each their own, I guess, Virg you little freak).   So far, on our first tourney we won all three games. I was unable to play because I popped a blood vessel in my eye.  I know what you are thinking - Ew.   Trust me, I ran for my phone so fast to call my eye doctor, Holy Toledo. I wasn't in pain, just had this HUGE bubble of blood in my eyeball, well, that's gone but there is a sea of blood around my eye now.  Of course I now go around freakin' everyone out. My rugger mates told me to come up with a creative story, that taking my contact out wasn't good enough... so here goes:  Two guys, one small room, very little time...
