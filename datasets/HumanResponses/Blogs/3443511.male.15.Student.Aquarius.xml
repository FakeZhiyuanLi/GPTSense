      The last couple of days were really boring.  I just sat in my room in complete darkness listening to the Slipknot c.d. and thinking about stuff.  Usually like, what is life, and the stuff no one can answer.  Before you ask, i am an atheist...  If you hate me because i'm atheis blow off, i hate people who hate others just because of what they are..  anyways, i just went over to my friends house.  We drove a lawn mower with a wagon on the end.  We felt like such hicks.  It was funny, we would wave to people and if they didn't wave back, we would flip them off.  Then of course, we had to do something to get their attention.  so, i flashed them...lol..  It was funny.  This dude on a cell phone looked at me like he wanted to molest me or something...It was funny.  I tried to stand up and pretend like i was surfing, but i fell like eight times, then the wagon fell apart, and i fell on my ass...It was funny..     Yeah, not much really happended....but, you know      ~All of my endings are waiting to begin~

      Yep, the last day of school, i wanted to impress some people.  So,i brushed my hair.  Now, you may not think this is a big deal, but...if you've ever seen someone without their hair brushed for months and then see that persons hair brushed....You will be shocked.  I had my finals in Algebra, Earth Science, and Informaiton Processing III.  I think i passed two of them.  The information processing III test was all on the stuff i didn't pay attention too because it was very boring....and i'm pretty sure i failed it...but the Algebra and Earth Science one.....i think i did fairly well.       I was soooo tempted to put ~You all suck~ and send it to every computer logged onto the server, but i decided not to.  They would trace me down in a second. Only because i got caught once before..  I had the website that the administraters use to do...pretty much everything in that school.  I wrote it on my arm, and a teacher caught me.  I didn't get sunspended or anything (cuz i'm good..lol).  I was pretty much just told to use my powers for good and not evil.  Although this principal i have is a real dick.  The high school principal wasn't bad, but this one....man.  He thinks he's so much smarter than everyone, but he's not and he always loses battles of wits against me and my friends.  It's soo funny to watch him squirm...lol..  Anyways, i don't have to deal with him anymore..seeing as i'm going to be moving down to the high school section next school year.  It's going to be great.  Now, i can actually bring my c.d. player without sneaking it around..     Well, my dad got me the Slipknot c.d. (i had to pay for it, but he went to the store).  The only reason he did this, is because he had time to kill while i was in teen court.  Oh, i got caught with possesion of the marihuana (however you spell it).  But, the sad part is, it wasn't mine.  That's a looong story i don't want to get into.  Anyways, he couldn't get the limited version one, because there wasn't a limited version one at the store.  The c.d. itself was only $16, i just said, kick ass!!!!!  Then, i just came home and caught up on some computer info...      ~The connection between people will always be the same~

      All right, it's Tuesday...the second last day of school.  I actually got 30 minutes to get ready this morning.  I was sooo happy.  I talked to my step-dad last night and he said that he would pick up the Slipknot c.d. on Wednesday.  IT CAME OUT TODAY!!!!  I was pissed because i spent hours working with him to get that c.d. the day it came out.  Now this ass says he can't get it.  I was ticked.  Anyways, now i have to wait till tomorrow night to get it...     Ahhh, yeah, we had locker "check" and cleanup today.  They just looked to see if there was any stickers or piles of crap in the locker.  They didn't even check.  Those lucky people who brought their stash...lol...     I was in my computer class, and i decided to send a couple more messages to the people of my school...  >.> It was quiet fun, i sent a message to that same girl saying it was someone else who sent her the message, and i auto-blocked the person for her.  I not only impressed her with my "computer skills"  but she also thought it was someone pulling a prank on her (about the girl i like).  I was "in the clear."  I couldn't have been happier...lol..  She looked at me differently though...it was kind of funny..     Yeah, this wasn't a very exciting day...I guess i got more admirers than i thought, another girl asked me out, so far, i know that 5 girls like me...and i don't like a single one... Not because i'm shallow or anything, but these girls are either really bitchy or just stuck up little....you know, the real "popular" people...lol...  I just came home and caught up on some more computer security articles.  I'm currently learning JavaScript, Visual Basics, and PHP.  Seeing as i am pretty good at HTML..  I actually made a couple pages on Notepad that goes directyl to a website (.html) for an assignment in my History class.  She was surprised with just basic commands...lol, it's fun to be admired...      ~only when you've lost everything are you free to do anything~

         I skipped Saturday and Sunday because they were so boring...You don't want to read boring crap do you?  You want to read stuff, so it makes you feel better about yourself.  Lol, and this blog is exactly what you need.           Yeah, alright, so i wake up late again (i never wake up early), rush rush this, and rush rush that....At school, i was walking down the hall, and i got more "interesting" stares than normal.  I usually get the "what the hell is wrong with that kid" kind of stares.  But, today i got the "How could that kid have emotions like compassion" kind of stares.  It was actually pretty funny on my part.  I thought, hmmmm....i wonder if she figured it out and told people, who told people, who told people, etc.             I went to talk to my friends, and the funniest thing i have seen in a long time walked around the corner.  It was one of my friends...and he was wearing a trench coat with harley davidson cut-off finger hole gloves.  It was hilarious, if you ever knew this kid, you would probably have fell off your seet when you saw this.  This kid is like a rapper (but not black) and he is not "harley-like" at all.  And when he came walking in in all black and that trenchoat on, everyone who saw him just laughed their asses off.  It was so fricken hilarious.        The day dragged on and on and on...Finally, i was in my computer class (Information Processing III or Advanced Word), i sent a little message to a person i knew was her friend.  Oh, it wasn't an e-mail..  You know when you get those little security boxes that say something like printer not connected, couldn't connect to site, some wierd text boxes that appear on the middle of your screen.  I sent her one of those.  I think i scared her.  It said sent from chs11587 (or something like that) to: (the persons name)..lol, it was pretty funny.  I just really wanted to test it out.  Anyways, i told her to send me an e-mail back if she knew if her friend knew who wrote the note.  Well, she never replied back...then, our system crashed, and it was all chaos.  Crappy school computers.  Oh, and i'm smarter than our computer technicians at school (on computers) so i have some fun...lol.         Anyways, i thought, oh shit, what if she didn't know about the note and was going to ask her about it.  I just gave myself away....SHIT!!!!  Well, i thought, i screwed myself, but, she never talked to me, sent me an e-mail, or anything....I was kind of confused...  But, as i always am.. you know.  Nothing much exciting happened from then on, i just went home, worked out, after a while went on the computer, and decided to make a blog for all the people to laugh at me...        ~Your life is ending one minute at a time, if you were to die tomorrow, what would you do today?~

           Alright, first, i should tell you a little about me...  I am a goth....not the wierd poser goth people, or a raver, but a goth.  Yes, i have had some majorly crappy things happen to me in my life.  I'm not going to tell you what exactly was so bad..  Why you ask, because i don't even know any of you (or so i think)..  Yes, i'm usually depressed, etc.  You get the picture...  I go to a little place called Campbellsport High School, it's filled with hicks...  Well, where i live is also filled with hicks.  Yes, i do live in the middle of nowhere...very depressing...  Well, i'm also very interested in computer security..  I'm 15, (birthday january 24) and i am very different.  You know those wrist band things...well, everyone has one, but i found a way to make mine even better.  My first one, i stuck some safety pins in it, so it formed x's all around the wrist band.  Then, my second one, i wear on my hand instead of my wrist.  Just so i'm different. :)  I have a step-dad (saw my dad like twice that i remember, don't know mucha at all about him or my uncle).  He's kind of a dick, but can be nice at times.  I have a step-sister that loves to tell secrets if there true or not..  I have a step-brother, i get along with him, but he's usually off working.  My mom, she was cool, but now, she's very different.  She was warped into my step-dad's mind setting, and now she's not at all fun to hang around with.  I hang out in my room either listening to music or watching some t.v. with the lights off, blinds shut, and curtains shut.  Lol, yes, i love the dark, why is everyone so afraid of it?  I'm going to start back a while before this blog date, just because that's when the stuff really gets "interesting."  Oh, and yes i'm a male, and yes *ladies* i am availabe...lol.  If you want to e-mail me, i'm at the_original_nights_shadow@yahoo.com..  Anyways, off to the next one.. *and for some reason, you can only go from one blog to another without it not finding the page, so just click back and go to the one you want..*         ~You can no longer sleep quietly once you've suddenly opened your eyes~

         All right, it's friday, and i just made a poem about, this girl i like, yesterday.  Now, i wish you all knew me at this point...all of you would be laughing your asses off..  This is the first time i actually asked a girl out...they usually ask me out...  My hearts thumping, what is she going to say..??  All right, make fun of me if you want for writing poems.  But, my poems are awesome..so shut up.  There not like normal people's poems.  There all about suicide, death, etc.  I made the poem a while back, this girl, isn't like me at all, so i kind of edited it a little bit.  Trying to be as sincere as possible.  Writing a poem sincere, when your me, is fricken hard!!!  Anyways, i get up and (same thing i do every morning when i have about 20 minutes to get ready) i eat some cereal.  Now, if you don't like cereal, your crazy..  Then, of course, i get on my bus for the 45 minute bus ride.  Yes, you heard right, 45 long-ass minutes on a bus..  At that time on the bus, my idol is the person who made the c.d. player...  My heart thumps harder and harder the closer i get to the school.          Anyways, when i get there (being the chicken-shit that i am) i gave the note to one of my friends to give this girl (like i'm going to tell you who..).  When i saw my friend again, she said that the girl said it was sweet, but (why is there always a but...) the more she got into it, it scared her. I was thinking in my head (dammit, i can't be sincere, it's too hard).  I guess, we all have something that we can't get rid off, it's always a part of us, and for me, it's the darkness inside.  Of course, i signed it annonymous, *phew*...  Now, this girl that i don't know said i was sweet, if i told her who i was, she would probably be like, this dude's scary...so, smart mind says....anonnymous...         I went home trying to think as hard as i could about what was scary in the note...came up with nothing..  Oh well, there's only 3 days left of school anyways...  I went on the internet, and learned a lot..  Mostly Javascript, PHP, and some other crap.  I learned some pretty fun stuff that i could pull of at my school on Monday...lol.  Yeah, leave all the messages you want..  Tell me what i should've done, etc.  Whatever...         ~Only as a band of poets, can we achieve what we want~

      Well, i haven't really done anything much...  I got in trouble a couple of times, and most of them were just wierd and strange stuff.  It was those days were everything you did, right or wrong, would get you in trouble.  Well, i got in trouble today.  They had found out i was on the computer...  I thought that i deleted my trace, but when my mom told me that i had been on, i was like...shit..  I didn't get in much trouble, she said next time i was caught, i wouldn't be able to go on ever.  So, i found out how she probably knew i was on....stupid administraters....i used my nifty skills, and put it on anonymous...so no one knows when i log onto the internet...L0L..  Anyways, someone i knew *cough*stalker post*cough* had found this blog.... and now i have to watch out what i write...L0L...Just kidding...  >.> well, i don't know what else to write, it's just a boring summer.....as usual...i have to get new crappy clothes...yep, i'm done here.....so....l8rs  "I have walked the path for so long that i cannot be helped, but help those who are starting the life i live."  (----That's my quote, take it and you die!!!
