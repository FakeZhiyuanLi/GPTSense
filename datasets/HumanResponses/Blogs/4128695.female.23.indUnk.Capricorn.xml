      its been a long day and even this morning i knew it would be...  just not myself today i guess...  i feel so out of place sometimes....  i know why... there just isnt much i can do about it right now... i need some control in my life...  i need that calming influence to help me through my day...it will come eventually... this is yet another exercise in patience...which i've never been particularly good at.  ever feel like you just cant do anything right?  must just be all the stress... too many things on my mind...   food for thought;  " Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ" Gal 6:2  you know... i've never owned a bible... i use to look at it as such a big step, really saying something... but i've accepted Christ in my life... buying a book he meant for everyone to rejoice in isnt a step, its something i should have done a long time ago, though i sort of like sitting in a church, or a library, or even chapters and absorbing the Word... i do find myself at certain points... like now when i wish i had its pages to find comfort in... it is indeed the most reassuring embrace i've ever known... to be enfolded within its pages and enthrawled in its glory...

      my mom's hand running through the baby hairs near my temples,  the way my dad use to hum when he put me to bed  how tight my sister would tuck me in,  the warmth of another body next to mine, curled against my back  the safety of crawling into my sisiter's bed when i was affraid of the shadows  the sweet sound of my bulldog snorring in the next room and how i use to wake in the middle of the night when he was a pup and sit up silently, waiting to hear him breath... hearing him and smiling to myself... and sleeping contentedly once again  the warm feeling of my beautiful neice falling asleep in my arms as i lay on the sofa with her at 4 months old    i bought a new bed today, but i dont get it until i move...  Its SO comfy, pillow top, plus my feather bed on top, it will be like sleeping on a cloud...  I cant wait to make my bed for the first time, me in a feather sandwich... feather bed on the bottom, me, then a fluffy feather duvet and pillows... mmmmmm   things are coming together with the apartment, i'm less nervous than i thought i would be.   i miss my family, i wish i were closer... i wish i could transplant them here...then again, if they were here.. i probably wouldnt be moving out on my own... meh...

         i dont have to work today...  I'm actually considering getting one of those hairless egyptian cats, though i have to say.. i'm still a dog person and i found myself perusing the boston terrier and pug breeder sites this morning...  i think the move to my new apartment will prove to be a little lonely, having a little creature around will probably help when those creepy-all-alone creeks and cracks start up... you know the ones... the sounds of a new place... one you arent use to... sounds that you blow completely out of proportion and once you're done with yourself you're convinced there's a savage killer hiding in your dryer... yeah...anyhow...   off to do some bed shopping... oh and of course a routine stop in at ikea and hmmm... maybe somewhere new... heheh... i kinda like shopping for my new place.. its been fun... now if only i could decide on a wall color i'd be set...

      7am, grunt and roll out of bed  8am, grunt and get in the shower  9am, grunt and fight the crowds at Ikea, buy some awesome dishes and get the heck outa dodge  10 am, sit in a meeting with my insurance broker and pretend like i wouldnt rather be in bed  11am, sit and wait... and wait... and wait to sign a lease to my new apartment.  done... okay.. i'm awake now..  drive towards ikea again... hmmm maybe not so awake... turn around and drive towards work... 7 patients and one hairy back later... my day is done... somehow my car ends up in the HomeSense parkinglot... i dont put up a fuss, i go in and start shopping...  20 minutes later, and 2 bed side tables heavier, off i go to the bank to fight with the ATM to deposit the paycheques... 2o minutes later and 4 ATM receipts too many i eat dinner... at 1030 pm....  off to bed i go with my new favorite gift;  The mathmos bubble ;  urlLink http://www.gnr8.biz/bubble.html   Its SO cool,   I've felt a little out of control these days... must get back on a regular schedule.  I'm considering asking a good friend of mine to mentor me again... to get me back into the right headspace, so that i can feel "right" in my skin...   Not having a consistant D/s element in my life is wearing on me a little...  that element just allows me to handle my every day so much better...  its such a beautiful thing... i'll discuss that beauty next time...   off i go to bed, with a full belly.... bad dreams here i come

Loo just always reminds me of this girl Sharron who was in my program, she's a brit, she use to always excuse herself to the "loo" hehe...   i got the coolest gift last night... details to follow...

      The last few days have been different.  I've found myself in conversation with God more than once, looking for strength, and amazingly enough... finding it in His spirit.  This week seems to be a very trying week for everyone, and its only tuesday, thats never a good sign.  I learn so much about myself when i'm speaking with others, last night i learnt that despite what i originally thought, when i'm upset, the last thing i want to hear is "everything is going to be okay" because really... i mean yeah it will be fine but really its just the passing of time that will make it okay... essentially there's still whatever the issue is that needs to be resolved and that needs to be gone through or dealt with.  So no... everything's not going to be fine... what ireally want to hear is... "i'll be here for you, not matter how hard it gets, and its okay to be weak, because i'm here to be strong for you"    But i suppose the natural reaction to someone being upset is reasurring them, telling them its going to be okay... even if its clearly not.  meh... enough for tonight...   goodnight my sweet Prince, whomever you are.. and wherever you are right now...sleep well and i'll meet you in dream.

       urlLink   The Road Not Taken Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.   Robert Frost

       I don't love you as if you were the salt-rose, topaz or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:I love you as certain dark things are loved,secretly, between the shadow and the soul.I love you as the plant that doesn't bloom and carries hidden within itself the light of those flowers,and thanks to your love, darkly in my body lives the dense fragrance that rises from the earth.I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,I love you simply, without problems or pride:I love you in this way because I don't know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so close that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when you close your eyes, i sleep.    Pablo Neruda  mmmmyummm !! " So close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close than when you close your eyes i sleep"

      I've found myself very deep in thought these days, figuring out how different the last year has made me.  Finding myself again, finding my roots again.  The "jade" green roots refer to my constant growth, green being the color of growth, and "jade" having been the nickname i used when i first started posting here ages ago...  When i first found words rich enough with meaning to put them to who i am, i was like a starved child at a feast, i couldnt help but devour publishings, i took bits and pieces from some of them and integrated the information into an understanding of the frustration i'd lived through for what i felt was such a long time.  I shortly discovered that, as the theme of my life goes, i'd discovered something about myself much sooner than anyone with similar feelings had.  I was 17.   17, and filled with a thirst for self-understanding.  It hadnt taken me too long, as a young teenager, to know boyfriends we'rent what i wanted.  It wasnt long before i grew bored, before i felt like they were too weak.  Why couldnt boys my age be strong, confident, agressive and even Dominant?  They lived their lives on the coat tails of others and even at that young age, ambition was a huge turn on for me, i wanted someone who knew what He wanted for Himself and what he wanted from me.   Talk about a frustrating time.  I tried talking with my then, highschool sweetheart, he thought i was weird.    I felt like maybe i was, but that maybe weird wasnt so bad in a town full of people who werent going anywhere, doing anything, wanting anything or aspiring for deeper, better things.    I grew up in a different sort of household.  I was my daddy's joy, he adored his little girls, but his girls were (in public) to be seen and not heard, and to always look proper.  I like that.  In private i was encouraged to speak my mind, politely at first and if i wasnt able to do so, i sort of felt like he'd give me permission to speak a little more freely, i would and then we'd reiterate in a more proper fasion, the best way to express whatever it was i needed to say.  My parents divorced when i was 9 and i lived with my dad from then on.  He raised me.  Things changed that year, He was busy with work and i found myself in need of structure.  I acted out, but the burden of an intelligent child is that they are rarely caught.  I was never without, at home.  I always had everything i needed, my dad did the best he could and succeeded more than most married parents could have.  He is the most amazing man i've ever met, i dont tell him that nearly enough.  On to college, i turned 18 in second semester, school was interesting, but my ride back to the house was filled with more anxst than the ride to school.   I was anxious to get back home, to get onto the education i felt i really needed, understanding myself and the way i work.  Books, texts, publishings, websites filled my world with words like;  power exchange, trust, love, Dominance, submission, passion, Master, spirit, respect.   i began to understand that what i really needed was a strong Man in my life.  A man i could respect and adore and be loyal to just as it should be, just as it was many many years ago.  I found myself studying the psychology of relationships, power differencials and the like.  I remember feeling a weight lifted from my shoulders when i finally realised i wasnt alone, i was a submissive woman, and there were others like me.  Not only that, but there were men out there who wanted a person like me, who found that desirable, who needed that powere exchange as much as i did and who cherished trust the way i did, but that they were intelligent men, with drive, ambition and who knew themselves very well... needless to say, i was happy.  I suppose thats enough background info on me... for now... if you're interested or currious about what the heck i'm talking about, a fantastic site is  urlLink www.castlerealm.com  which is where i got my nick name _jade.  The submissive who wrote some of the articles, just has a way about her... and though she's now passed away, i believe i do her justice in using her nickname.

      i'm not a "cat person" but recently a certain feline has come into my life and i have to say she's a very special kitty.  I'm quite certain her amazing temperment and layed back ways are thanks to her owner who has loved every hair on her little kitty body since the day she was taken home.   She came up to me this morning and snuggled against my back, purring up a little storm as she walked all over me and decided upon a resting spot above my head.   Thank our Lord for Claritin  Liberators .  I'm sitting at the hospital, half working, half not really here... my heart isnt here today, i must have left it in bed.   i had a fantastic conversation, one i plan to reiterate for myself here,  later on today.  I've been told i'm a complicated person alot these days... i dont think thats a bad thing, i think it just means i have to work extra hard to know myself well... and be able to explain my quirks and needs.   there's a beautiful promise i found in a card the other day and i'll end with it for now;    " My Promise to You"      If you're feeling empty inside, i'll fill your heart with favorite you-and-me stories to make you smile     If neither one of us knows what to say, I'll sit quietly with you in the closeness we share what needs no words.     If you start to doubt, I'll help you find your courage again.     If the climb is steep and long, I'll hold your hand and we'll walk each step of the way together.          And if you say, "who cares?" I'll remind you how very much i do.  Because when i say, "i'm here for you" i mean it for as often and as long and in whatever way you need me        I hope that one day i'll be able to stand and look up into the loving eyes of my life partner and say these words to him.  For now, i rest assured that with words that exist so beautifully, there has to be a relationship level that merits their creation.  I want to be so much for that ONE special person.  That want is such a part of my entire being.  I'm content though, knowing that my path will bring me there, and anxious to think that perhaps i'm already in the process of arriving...

      I've been a fan of Khalil Gibran's writtings for a long time, i particularly found a reflections of myself and my understandings in the pages of his book  The Prophet.      one of my very favorite passages from its pages;  "  And when he speaks to you, believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth"           The Prophet on Love (Khalil Gibran)
