             A dozen roses, a few lilies Could shine away a lady’s gloom But a simple thought that comes from the heart Could touch her soul Like no words can tell  A simple hello with the slightest care Is better than a whole conversation With no feelings, no emotions Like a gift box with blue silverish ribbons So sweet, so pretty, so tempting to all But inside’s just a deep hollow hole Empty and dry  Showing that you care Sounds too heavy to lift Too much to carry Too dark to explore Too painful to touch And too far to reach Though the slightest care Could change tears to laughter And shines away clouds of darkness   DENIAL’s  the door that shuts everything Closed every entrance Shutting out all possibilities  FEAR!  Hide it as you can Shield it at all time so no one can see Toss the key away, to eternity A survival kit though a  COWARD’s  move  Hide your care, love and feelings Or  HURT’ll  be there with no mercy Emotions sealed to be drown Leaving feelingless, emptiness and loneliness Till the key offers its help To unlock the doors with a simple   FAITH  .
