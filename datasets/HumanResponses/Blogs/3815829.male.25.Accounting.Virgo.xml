      I sent this email to a friend today:   Nathan,  Christine and I doubled with Patrick and Hang today. We went to Golden Gate Park in SF for a picnic. Hang broke her sandal while stepping in a gopher hole, so we headed down the street to buy some replacement sandals. Before we reached the store, we stopped by the Thai festival to check out the commotion. We found some lady with metallic and black clothes belting (actually lip syncing) I Will Survive to a quiet elderly crowd. Patrick's jaw dropped in awe. Pouring gasoline onto an already raging inferno, the color guard came out before the lip synchers next song... Whitney Houston's Superbowl rendition of the  urlLink Star Spangled Banner ! I was in an alternate universe. Things like this only happen when you're with Justin.   Yeah, so after we dropped Christine off in San Mateo, we stopped by Han Kook Supermarket in Sunnyvale for some marinated Korean spareribs. Patrick bought a packet of curry for $1.99. Awesome.  So whats new?  Ryan

      Kate Bush is my new favorite discovered musician. Listen to:  urlLink This Woman's Work  (requires iTunes). You cannot dance to this music. Or understand it. But apparently she is a major influence on some of my favorite artists like OutKast and Prince. If you can explain how an eclectic 80's UK pop musician inspired neosoul artist Maxwell to cover her work, then you might understand Dave Matthews Band's appeal. I don't.

      I went door to door today, passing out the following in the  urlLink Futura  typeface:   Gardie Place Way Block Party Proposal  You may have remembered our first (and only) block party in the late 80's. I was in Elementary School. It is now 2004 and the need for a cohesive and friendly neighborhood is greater than ever. The solution is clear:  Let's BBQ Let's have games for the kids Let's eat apple pie Let's watch a movie outdoors  Let's have a block party   I propose to schedule the event on Saturday, July 24 or 31. Please contact Ryan Sebastian at rsebastian@gmail.com or call (408) 425-3136 to participate. Thank you!   Yeah, so it's jingoistic and borrows liberally from the Mini advertisement campaign. I think it will be a blast!

      In a few more days, ICANN will release ryansebastian.com from its  urlLink evil clutches . My former address is floating in domain name purgatory, its 30 + 40 day holding period nearing completion. I need some ideas. Time to steal them.

      They lurk everywhere...hotel lobbies, coffee shops and non-descript office parks. Dressed in suit and tie, they offer you dreams beyond your imagination...world travel, mansions and luxury cars. They only ask for three things in exchange: some startup funds, a bit of your time and potentially most damaging â€“ a change in motives.  So if you are part of World Financial Group, Britt Worldwide, Cutco, Xango, Amway or Quixtar, don't get defensive. If its working for you, more power to you. Some of you are my friends. Some of you are my family. I can deal with that. I know you've been calling me. I've even met some of you for lunch. But I won't do it. I can't afford to change my motives. It would cost too much.

      After almost a year of living in San Jose, I have yet to find a suitable car wash. Who else is going to keep my  sweet  1991 Honda Accord EX coupe in its pristine condition? Even with 222,000 miles, I average one unsolicited offer every month!  I mean, this ride is  sweet . With some transparent fender flares, gold door trim and plastic chrome spinners, you too can have the ultimate Eastside G-ride with rock solid Honda reliability. Let me know if you are interested. I plan to sell it towards the end of the year.  But I digress. One of the best things about Los Angeles is its relatively low cost of living. If you don't mind driving east of La Brea or south of the Santa Monica Freeway every so often, you can really stretch your budget. Just avoid chain stores in the barrio at all costs. You'll be hit with the " urlLink ghetto tax ." It is real and it is severe. I myself have been a victim. Consider yourself aware.  Like visiting any third world country, the secret to enjoying Los Angeles is to know some natives. How can you beat a full  urlLink car wash for $5 ? In San Jose, I'll be lucky to receive the same service for $11. How can the same service in LA be less than half the price? Yes, immigrant labor is awesome.

      Lei, Kashiim, Christine and I purchased our tickets for Prince's  urlLink Musicology Tour . First row for the $50 seats at the HP Pavilion on Saturday, September 11. I wonder if he will ask us to open our Bibles during Purple Rain.

      Spiderman 2 takes on a wholly different track than the typical Hollywood blockbuster movie (ex: Bad Boys II). Instead of turning up the volume on explosions and CGI effects to overwhelm the audience into submission, Spiderman 2 delivers the rare big budget combination of populist, character-based film making. Almost as great as Napoleon Dynamite!

      I am a habitual wedding guest. Most of my trips consist of weddings. I've catered, videotaped and DJ'd weddings. I've had five roommates move out because of marriage. My girlfriend is a  urlLink wedding singer .  My friends Alex and Lorraine are getting hitched tomorrow a mile from my house. We were also at Song and Jennifer's wedding in Los Altos last week. The week before that, my girlfriend performed at a military wedding at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. You would think I'd be sick of weddings. But I'm not. I love these gatherings. And yes, I go to both the reception and ceremony. Excellent.

      What do these things have in common? They all play a part in my underhanded bid to bump my Google page ranking. My old site, ryansebastian.com, once graced the top of any Google search on "Ryan Sebastian." No longer. With a dead web host, I abandoned the site because I didn't want to pay $90 to Globat for a year of hosting (which is an excellent deal). Most likely this won't work, since I really know nothing of search engine optimization anyways. Suggestions?

      I never considered myself to be a writer. If it where up to me, I would write out everything in bullet point, calmly listing various things that I have or plan to do. I've kept a blog before. Four years ago while in college, I posted a random mix of pictures and observations with a webcam sitting on my desk, documenting a year in my life. I called it, "Real World 90007," a total ripoff of a friend's webcam site, " urlLink Real World Irvine ," which is directly stolen from that MTV show that I've never seen. For the most part, I don't watch television. It's like a badge of honor for me.  I view the internet quite differently. I have come to a decision in the past week that I'm on the internet too much. A sad byproduct of working from home. I'd rather be spending time running through a forest (which I try to do at least once a week) or studying 2000 year old religious texts. Yeah, so I decided to start a blog. Which is not entirely contradictory. I won't defend my decision. It is what it is.  So my general plan (must have a plan...or at least plan to not have one) is to write every so often. So, don't expect to hear much from me. Only when I want to. You have my word - I have zero commitment to this blog. It means almost nothing to me. Nothing. My only hope is that I'll draw out deep. And make my girlfriend laugh if possible.
