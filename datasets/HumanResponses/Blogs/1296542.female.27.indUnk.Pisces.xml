       Sitcom Twin Investigation Wrap-Up   My research is complete and the verdict is in (slide your eyeballs down two posts for the details).    Ok, fine...I can see where the chick does look like me in certain instances, perhaps even enough to cause  some  people to think of me when they see her, but not so much that I would consider it a striking resemblance.    But hey, if my friends/coworkers/family want to insist that I look like a cute girl on a show...who am I to argue?  On a side note...after sitting through an episode of this show, I realize that my disinterest was for the best.

       Shake Me Like a British Nanny   I've been a bad bad girl (Fiona anyone?).  I ditched class early tonight. My professor has cancer and tonight was one of her chemo nights.  I just couldn't bear 5 hours with the TA.  My prof is awesome.  The TA...not so much.

       The Zam Sitcom Twin Investigation   I have never seen, nor have even considered watching "The George Lopez Show," partly because it didn't interest me, but mostly because I have class every night.  Recently, it has been brought to my attention (once last week and twice just today), that the character, "Carmen Lopez" on the show (apparently she is the daughter figure) bears a striking resemblance to me.  Hmm...My curiosity has been piqued.  I must investigate this phenomenon further.  I shall set my vcr to tape this week's episode and see for myself.  Stand by...

       Weekly Wrap Up    1. What song (new or old) do you secretly enjoy, but publicly ridicule? Why?  Without Me by Eminem.  I have no idea why, but this stupid song just grew on me.  “Guess who’s back?...Back again…Shady’s back…Tell a friend…Guess who’s back…guess who’s back…guess who’s back?...Dadada…”   2. Do you carry a purse or tote bag or backpack? If so, what's inside?  A purse, the contents of which include:  my wallet, cell phone, car keys, emergency feminine hygiene product of choice (hey, you wanted to know…), a pack of gum (Extra…the green kind), a scrunchie, some make-up, a buttload of spare change (all the change that isn’t already in the ash tray of my car), my work badges, and a couple of pens.   3. Describe your dream job. Why did you select this one?  Photojournalist.  I love to travel, take photographs and do artsy kind of things.   4. You are given an opportunity to live anywhere in the world, expense free, but you can never move again. Where do you live? Why?  Right here in Houston.  I could never leave my family and friends.   5. What do you like about living in your particular city? Would you recommend it to others as a good place to live and work? Why?  Heck yeah!  Come on down to Houston!  We have it all here:  Big city life, small town living, amusement parks, beaches, and awesome theaters and museums.  The population is diverse and if you can't find a job here, you simply aren’t looking.  The food here is awesome and we’ve got the Astros, Rockets, Texans, Aeros, and Comets.  Need I say more?   6. You have a superpower. What is it? What do you do with it? Do you tell anyone?  ESP.  Well, I certainly would not tell the folks at the racetrack!   7. What five people, living or dead, famous or not, do you wish lived on your block?  M.C. Escher, Ludwig Van Beethoven, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edgar Allen Poe, and Homer Simpson.  Can you imagine what the BBQ’s would be like?

       I Dub Me...Unforgiven   Carla's on vacation.  She left without even telling me.  What was I supposed to do?  I needed it bad and Kevin was there.   Her coworker,  Kevin was there.  I had never been with a man, and when Kevin said that Carla would never have to know, I let my need take hold.  I let him have his way with me.    My gosh...what was I thinking?  But his fingers through my hair were more gentle than I could have imagined.  "We won't tell Carla a thing," he whispered.  I knew it was wrong, yet in that moment when I should have spoken a halting word, I wavered and found myself slipping into quiet acquiescence.    In retrospect, I realize that I knew then, as I know now, that I would have to confess everything to Carla.  Carla--who knows everything about me, and I her.  You see?  There is no sense in denial.  She's going to take one look at me and know.  She'll see.  I can't hide this.  I will have to tell her all about Kevin... her coworker,  Kevin...and his gentle fingers.  The tension between them will be insurmountable.    What have I done?  I can only hope that my honesty and assurance that I will never stray from her again will be enough.  I can only hope that she will still see me.   I can't believe that I have been this foolish.   I can't believe that I...cheated...on my hairstylist.

       What's On Tap?   Looks like I'll be heading down to the Juice Box (Minute Maid Park for you non-Houstonians) tonight to watch my Astros whoop up on "Corky" and the Cubs.  Man, I love baseball.  My 'Stros are kicking some serious butt lately!  Aside from church Saturday night and bowling Sunday night, the rest of my weekend will be spent studying and hopefully having make-up sex with my laptop.  I'm not  even  going to get into the nightmare that has been my experience with Dell Tech Support again.  Suffice it to say that, at the moment, my opinion about the folks over at Dell is too raunchy to post.

       Dude!  I Hate Dell!   Well, actually, it's just their technical support staff that I dispise.  I have been struggling with them for exactly 16 days now.  Today, I am ashamed to admit, I finally lost my patience.  I let their supervisor hear all about how unprofessional and retarded they all are (no, I did not use the word, "retarded" in my conversation with said supervisor, but I was thinking it).   He apologized profusely, making me feel a little guilty, however, the guilt passed when he finally disclosed that a part for My Precious (my laptop) was on backlog and would not be in until the 8th of August.    I counted to 10 in Spanish  and  in English before finally saying..."WHAT?!?!  You have GOT to be kidding me!  You guys have had my system at your 'service depot' for almost 2 weeks and you're telling me NOW that I have to wait over two more weeks before my motherboard will even be in?!?"  Supervisor Guy:  "Actually, Ma'am, the part we are waiting on is the palm rest."  Me:  "They are supposed to be replacing the motherboard because my NIC was fried.  Why are we waiting on a palm rest?"  Supervisor Guy:  "Because it was damaged, Ma'am."  Me:  "When and how?  Because the system did not leave my posession with a damaged palm rest."  Supervisor Guy:  "Well, they have to replace the palm rest as part of the left upper mouse button."  Me:  "Left upper mouse button?!?  What the?!?!  They are supposed to replace the mother board!  What happened to the mouse button?!?"  Supervisor Guy:  "I don't have that information, Ma'am.  I can only tell you what's on the spec."  Me:  *after several deep breaths and more counting*  "Was anyone planning to notify me of the additional repairs being made to my system, or was I just supposed to sit here and wait for a month?"  Ok.  Enough with the script version or you guys will be scrolling forever.  I finally told the guy that waiting until the 8th was completely unacceptable.  When I inquired as to how on Earth the palm rest could affect the proper functioning of my motherboard, he finally gave in and said that it didn't but they wanted to replace it "to prevent any future issues."  Whatever the heck that means!    He said that my laptop was functioning fine and that they could ship it out to me tomorrow, sans the new palm rest, and then contact me when the palm rest was in stock and then replace it at my convenience.  To make a long story...crap...if I were trying to be concise I would have started making the story short from the beginning...basically, I should have My Precious back by this Thursday and I will have to send it out again to get the palm rest replaced next month.  Grrrr....  In less annoying news:  I got a 98 on my exam yesterday!  Wheeeee!  Go me!

       Good Times Weekend   What a great weekend I had!  Actually, I am still enjoying my extra long weekend.  In an effort to avoid posting a novel about my trip (and I could, easily) I will simply touch upon a few of the highlights.  Here's the rundown:  Location:   urlLink  Yeargan's River Bend Resort  on the Frio River, nestled in the beautiful Texas Hill Country (a 5-hour drive from Houston).  Fellow Weekenders:  My sister, Jen; my brother-in-law, Mike; my 13-year-old niece, Alexis; my 2-and-a-half-year-old niece, Emily; and my best friend,  urlLink BatoMan5000 .  Highlights:   -  Alexis playing "hair salon" on my head on the way up there and watching other motorists gawk at my ponytail mohawk, braided-stick-straight-up pigtails, and bowtie atop my head.   -  The drive through the Texas Hill Country.  In a word:  Gorgeous.   -  Our cabin (we know how to rough it!):  2 baths, 4 beds, kitchen...right in front of the lake.   -  The Frio River.  A beautiful spring-fed river with crystal clear water.   -  Watching Mike and Batoman5000 dance around and cling to their "boys" as they eased their way into the cold water.  Hilarious!  It's called the  Frio  River for a reason.   -   Tubing!  Wheeeeee!  We floated down the river in between canyons with enormous rock cliffs, surrounded by huge cypress trees and ice-cold natural springs flowing straight out of the rock along side us.  The rapids and shoots were so much fun!     -  Mike: "Hey watch it.  This rock is slippery...*slip* *slam* *slide*...ow...my ass!"   -  Roasting marshmallows and making smores at midnight under a sky carpeted with stars.  I have never seen that many stars in my life.  The shooting stars were a dime-a-dozen.   -  Walking near the lake in the pitch black and almost stepping right in.  Hahahaha!   That  would have been hilarious!   -  Mike, Batoman, and I creeping up on a bullfrog by the lake in the dark (see previous) and having it turn out to be nothing but a crumpled Coke can.  Mike even had me convinced that I was seeing the dang frog's eyes reflecting off his flashlight.  To...freakin'...funny!   -  Mike crawling into bed with a sleeping Batoman, snuggling up to him, and whispering, "My name is Carlos, Man of Love!"   -  Mike:  "Hey watch it.  This rock is slippery."  Batoman:  "*slip* *slam* *slide*...ow...my ass!"   -  Sitting outside at midnight (again) and watching the stars and this time,  the bats  circling over our heads.  Pretty freakin' cool.   -  Jen:  "Hey, how's that hotdog taste?"  Me: "Fine...WHY?!?"  Jen:  "*snickering at Mike* I told you it would be fine."  Me:  "WHY?!?!?"  Mike: "*laughing* 'cause she dropped it in the ashes at the bottom of the grill and came in here and rinsed it off before putting it on your plate."   -  Emily swimming by herself!  Yaaaaay!!!   -  On the way back, driving through San Antonio on a trek to find "The best Mexican food" Mike has ever had.  The place was closed.     -  Stopping in the little German town of Gruene (pronounced "green") and wandering around some really cool arts and crafty kind of shops.  Oh yeah, and the Ice Cream Parlor!  Mmmm...ice cream...   -  Having "the worst Mexican food" Jen's ever had at this little Mexican place in Gruene.   -  Experiencing a two-year-old's temper tantrum in the car (That is all the birth-control I need, right there).   -  Sunblock is essential!  Picture for me the position of one's body when floating down a river on a tube.  The butt sinks down into the water, arms and legs draped over the sides of the tube.  If one should neglect to put sunblock on say....her knees, one would wind up with the most hilarious sunburn on her knees and  only  her knees.  Ok.  It was me and my knees are glowing.  Shut up.    -  Batoman:  "Hey watch it.  This rock is slippery."  Me:  "I think I can make it....*slip* *slam* *slide*...ow...my ass!"   -  Sunblock is essential part II.  Jen:  "I  never put sunblock on my legs.  They don't burn."  And later that evening, "OH MY GOD...MY LEGS...MY LEGS..."   -  Site-seeing drive up through the hills.  Me:  "Hey!  Is that a playground?!?"  Batoman:  "That's a cemetary!"  Me:  "Oops."  (In my defense, the tombstones were quite colorful!)   -  The best beef jerky I've ever had.  Mike picked it up in some little town along the way.  Mmm...mmm...mmm!   -  Early morning fishing in the lake.  The lures weren't working, but damn if Froot Loops and a piece of bread didn't catch us a bass and a catfish!   -  Reading (actually studying for the exam that I have tonight) at the river's edge at dusk.  So peaceful.  And then walking back to our cabin with an endless fireworks show of light-bugs flickering all around me.  There are so many things that I could write about this weekend, but I would be sitting in front of this computer all day (and I need to get back to studying), so I'll stop here.  Suffice it to say that this was an  awesome  weekend.  Pictures coming soon (or as soon as Batoman5000 gets them developed).  ---Fin---

       Weekend Rundown    Friday  - Went to the movies with my best friend and had a great time!  We saw "The League of Extraordinary Gentleman."  I left the theater kind of on the fence about whether or not this movie would get 2 thumbs up.  I've decided that what I liked about the movie was more the  concept  than the actual production, so it gets a thumb and half.  Eew.  Half a thumb...that's kind of sick.   Saturday  - Went to the 'Stros game.  They played Pittsburgh and we had a blast despite the Astros losing 5-2.  We had great seats!  Front row Bullpen Box seats.  Thanks Tom!!!   Sunday  - Church in the morning.  It was awesome (see post below)!  Sunday night is bowling league night.  We won 2 out of 3 games, despite my horrible performance.  It's pretty sad when you would have scored higher by taking a blind (average minus ten pins) and not showing up at all.  Sheeesh!  It was fun, though!  Oh yeah!  How could I forget?  I got a second gig this weekend!  I've hopped back into the concert security thing for grins and giggles.  It's a work-whenever-the-heck-you-feel-like-calling-in type of deal.  Basically, I consult a schedule of upcoming shows and call in if I want to work it.  Can't beat that!  Our group works everything from rock shows to plays/musicals/comedy shows to sporting events.  Can I get an "OH YEAH BABY I'M SO HOOKED UP?!?!?"  On a non-weekend note:  I start school tonight.  Crap.

       and now…a tune from my spiritual ukulele    I began my Christian walk approximately two years ago.  I was “born again” on Mother’s Day of 2001, and have been attending  urlLink  Lakewood Church   ever since.  The services at Lakewood are uplifting, enlightening, and, quite frankly, often move me to tears.  The message from Pastor  urlLink Marcos Witt   this Sunday was no exception.  “Come On / Move On / Hang On” was his word.  It was a message regarding our dreams and ambitions.  He began with three statements about having dreams:   1.  DREAM!  2.  DREAM!!  3.  DREAM!!!!  “Have you ever watched a relay race?” he went on.  No matter how great the first runners perform, it’s the last runner that makes or breaks the race.  If the last runner drops that baton,  everybody  loses.  He told us that our lives and dreams are like that race.  Our spectators are a great gallery of witnesses watching us from Heaven, including the likes of Joseph and David and Deborah and the Apostle Paul.  They are all looking down upon us and cheering and shouting, “Come on!  Move on!  Hang on!  Don’t drop that baton!  You’re almost there!”   ”Come On”  - Marcos said that there are 3 types of people in the world:  The first type of people are those who know that something is happening and jump right into the middle of it and move around in the mix and make things happen for themselves.  The second type of people are those who know something is happening but stand in the background wishing that they could get involved.  They stand there looking up at the sky, waiting for opportunity to drop from Heaven and hit them on the head.  The third type of people are those who have no idea that anything is going on and don’t care (“…and you know who you are!”).  “Come on!” he said.  “Do something!  Anything!  Just do something!”  Even if you don’t know where to begin, just jump in there and start doing.  If it’s the wrong thing, then hey, that’s one thing you can strike from the list of things not to do to get your dream.   ”Move On”  - “Sometimes you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other.”  Marcos spoke here about obstacles or “speed bumps” that will, inevitably, be tossed in the middle of the path to our dreams.  When the price starts to get high, (not financially per se) you must keep on moving.  He quoted a couple of lines from a song here that he had heard (the artist escapes me now), that just cracked me up, because it’s so true – “If you’re catching hell…don’t hold on!”  and “If you’re going through hell…don’t stop!”  Move on!   ”Hold On”  - “Hold on to your dreams.”  At this point, Marcos likened dreams to a merry-go-round that is spinning faster and faster and all you have to do is hold on “with all ten finger-claws, and all ten toe nail-claws, and with your teeth clenched…HOLD ON!”  He called this his, “White-Knuckle Anointing.”  He went on to say that studies have shown, that people who hold on their dreams for five years, ultimately get their dream.  “How many people have dropped that baton at year 4.5,” he asked?  Hold on!  Marcos then asked us to watch a short video with him that, he thought, succinctly summed up his message this morning.  There was no sound.  The video played on the three large screens above the pulpit and Marcos spoke as we watched.  On the screen we saw an Olympic track competition.  We watched as the runners began to circle the track. One runner, Derek Rodman, was in the “Come On” stage of his dream, Marcos said.  Then, something happened.  Suddenly, we saw Derek fall to the ground.  The camera stayed with the rest of the pack.  “Things are going to happen,” Marcos said, “and people around you won’t even be aware.”  The race ended and then the camera panned back to Derek, lying on the ground in agony and then dragging himself to his feet.  He had violated a hamstring and the terrible pain he was in was evident on his face.  We saw Derek begin to limp tenderly on that bad leg around the track, in tears.  “This…is the ‘Move On’ stage of a dream,” Marcos said as we watched the runner shove people away that were trying to get him to quit.  He limped on…and we watched with lumps growing in our throats.  Out of the stands someone came running to Derek’s side.  The man put his arms around his shoulders and Derek wept into his neck and they walked together…through the finish line.  “This…this is the ‘Hold On’ part of having a dream,” whispered Marcos.  “If you will come on, move on, and hold on to your dreams, God will put someone at your side to walk with you through the finish.”    The lights came up and all 7,000 of us had tears streaming down our faces.  The man who helped Derek to the finish ended up being his father, by the way.  In an interview after the race, Derek Rodman was asked why, why on Earth he had kept going in so much pain when the race was already over?  His response:  “My dream was not to begin this race.  It was to finish the race.”  I was so moved by this sermon that I went out to the lobby of the church and purchased a CD recording of it.  It will serve as a word of encouragement to me when I start to bobble my baton, and I will pass it along to my friends when they need to be uplifted.  To all of you who are my friends, (and even those of you who have happened upon my blog by chance) if you guys are in need of encouragement and would like to hear this incredible word, drop me an  urlLink  email   and I would be more than happy to burn you a copy and send it to you.  Peace.

       Nostalgia   The DJs on the radio this morning were having callers phone in their childhood television crushes.  This got me thinking about mine.  Man, was I ever in love with Chad Allen back in his   urlLink Our House   days.  Remember that show?  With a pre-Quaker Oats Wilfred Brimley and Shannon Doherty before she was bitter?  That was my pre-teen soap opera (well, that and  21 Jump Street ).  When I was a kid, my bedroom walls were covered in  Teen Beat, Bop , and  Star  magazine posters.  I used to beg them off of my parents when we would go to the grocery store.  One of my bedroom walls was dedicated solely to (oh man...I just know I'm going to catch such crap for admitting this...)  The New Kids on the Block .  Danny!  Donnie!  Jordan!  John!  Joey!    On my closet door was a door-sized poster of George Michael - another love of my junior high life (that is, before I matured to Sebastian Bach of Skid Row and Kip Winger).  After a brief stint on my ceiling, George moved back to the closet door where he hung so hotly in all his five-o'clock-shadow glory.  But I digress...  This post was supposed to be about Chad.  As a matter of fact,  urlLink this  is one of the very posters that was included in my childhood Chad Allen shrine.  Good God, I was such a cheesy kid....*shudder*  Chad...where are you now?  Have you been banished to that former-teen-idol retirement home called,  Lifetime Television ?  Tell Nancy McKeon I said, "Hi."  Man I used to love that  Facts of Life ...    You take the good you take the bad you take them both and there you have the facts of life...

       Back to School   School started earlier this week.  I have actually been looking forward to getting this Fall semester underway.  I finally feel like I am at a point on my educational path (albeit a somewhat meandering path) where the destination is in sight.  On tap for this semester:  Discrete Math  - It turns out that this is NOT in fact the type of math that people do privately.  It deals with logic and the conversion of statements to symbols.  The professor is alright, if seemingly perplexed by her own lecture at times.  Tonight, we broke out this murder mystery into statements, converted them to symbols and then solved the crime (it was the chauffeur!).  Pretty cool.  I enjoyed it.  Geez...I'm such a dweeb.   Programming w/ C  - The professor sounds like Ms. Swan from MadTV.  I cannot pronounce her name nor am I able to understand half of what she says...should make for an interesting semester.   Programming w/ Java  - I haven't been to this class yet, but it should be fun.  Stay tuned...

       Honky Tonk Man   I am always amazed at how much authority is attributed to a flashlight and an “Event Staff” shirt.     Much to my amusement, the Dwight Yoakum concert was sold out Thursday night.  I stood at the entrance to the venue rummaging through ladies purses.  Now, I know that I accumulate a lot of crap in my purse, but from time to time, I clean it out, leaving nothing but the minimum essentials – wallet, make-up, cell phone, emergency feminine hygiene product, etc.   Some of the purses that I examined that night were just ridiculous.  I was dumbfounded by some of the junk that women had in their bags.  I feel much better now about the collection of gum wrappers and receipts in mine.  We were set up at the entrance guys to guys and ladies to ladies.  Meaning, any gentleman wishing to enter the venue would have to first be electronically frisked (or wanded) by our guys and any ladies wishing to enter the venue (with a purse) would have to submit to a bag search by our gals (me and a few other girls).  I assume this was to spare any embarrassment that may be felt by a lady carrying a purse full of tampons (as was the case Thursday night – if I’m lyin’ I’m dyin’!) or the mutual discomfort that may be felt by a 6’5 cowboy and the 5’6 girl that would be doing the wanding.  The latter, of course, would exclude the handful of “gentleman” who requested an old fashioned hand frisking by me personally.  I am generally not attracted to cowboys (AKA “kickers”) but I nearly agreed to a couple of those frisking.  Some of those guys were hot in their tight Wranglers and boots.  Yeeeehaaaw!  When the flood of people entering the building slowed to a trickle, I wandered over near the stage and watched the show for a bit.  Actually, I watched for as long as I could take it.  I’m not a fan of country music at all, however there are some artists that I can stomach and even enjoy.  Not the case with good ol’ Dwight.  His style is old fashioned twangy country music.  Not my thing at all, but his fans seemed to love him.  By the end of the show and after umpteen trips to the various bars in the venue, his fans seemed to love  everyone .  I stood at the exit asking people to kindly dispose of their drinks before leaving the building, and wishing them a good night.  I was the recipient of at least a hundred drunken embraces (I call them ‘beer-hugs’).  It was hilarious to see some of the same folks that had smiled and thanked me on the way in, stagger out and slur a drunken “g’night.”  Many of them still wanted to dance - I almost learned to two-step.  Too funny!

Your foot will change direction.  Wild   The sad thing is...I tried it.

       Weekend Rundown   …and a very nice weekend it was:   Friday :   Freddy Vs. Jason .  I knew it was going to be cheesy but I just couldn’t resist!  It was classic ‘b-movie’ fun – blood, gore, nudity, and moronic, horny teen-agers.  Too funny!  The final battle seen was pretty cool.     Saturday :  Dinner out on the patio of The Fisherman’s Wharf (great seafood place) and a cruise along the beach with the top off of the Jeep with a good friend.  Can’t beat it.  We parked on the seawall, walked down to the beach and out onto a rock breaker bar that juts out into the water.  We sat out there and talked and watched the waves crash around us and looked up at the stars and Mars.  What a nice night!   Sunday :  Let’s hear it for the ‘Alvin Total Chaos!’  Wooohoooo!  That’s my niece’s soccer team.  They won the championship and my niece made a sweet play to score a goal.  It was hot as hell out, though.  Sheeeesh!  Sunday night is also bowling league night.  We had too much fun tonight - laughed our butts off.  This buddy of mine that’s on another team comes up to me and says that “a certain someone” on his team has ‘a thing’ for me and sent him over to find out the scoop on me.  Unfortunately for me, he made this inquiry in the presence of some of my teammates.  It should go without saying that hilarity ensued after that.  I told him that I wasn’t interested and thanks, but no thanks yadda yadda yadda.  Then he comes back over and says that the guy wants to know if he could talk to me.  I said ‘Hell no!  I don’t care what you tell him!  Just get rid of him for me!”  It was like junior high all over again.  I was half expecting him to pass me a note:  “I like you.  Do you like me?  If so, circle ‘yes’…”  I caught so much crap from the team the entire night.  Too…freakin’…funny!

        935 Days    ...until I “turn” gay.   I am to have this epiphany when I am 29.    This impending turn of events was revealed to me by an openly gay coworker approximately four years ago.  Evidently her gaydar was set to ‘ESP’ that day.  I shared her revelation with a handful of my coworkers back then, creating an endless source of workplace amusement and teasing (at my expense) among us.  If I recall correctly, the conversation went something like, “Oh my God!  You guys are NOT going to believe what ‘so-and-so’ told me!”  To this day I have not been able to work a solid week without having someone comment on “The Countdown.”  As I walked into the office this morning, one of the guys gave me a thumbs-up, wink, and a “29, baby!” and the thought occurred to me that I should include my blogger-friends in the hilarity of “The Countdown.”  So there you have it.  March 7, 2006 – mark your calendars folks.  Ladies, please be patient.  Gentlemen, the clock is ticking.

       Are You a Web Addict?   According to  urlLink  this article  , we could all be spending an unhealthy amount of time online.  The article lists a few criteria (cleverly contained within the acronym MOUSE) that could be potential problem areas.  Based on the following, I too am an addict:  • Excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online.  Excessive thinking has always been a problem for me.  I can’t help it.  I am a reflective person by nature.  Since reading this article, however, I realize that all of this thinking could send me tumbling toward addiction.  I am resolved to change.    From this day forward, I, Zam, will curtail my neural synapses when not online.  I will no longer partake in excessive thinking at home, school, and certainly  never  at work.  Instead, I will sit glassy-eyed, in a vegetative state, allowing drool to trickle from my lips.  Perhaps I should adopt a new offline handle – a moniker representative of the stream-of-consciousness-run-dry going on in my head.    I’ve got it…  Hence forth, I shall be known as “Tumbleweed.”

       'til Death Do We Part (or Until I Am Offered More Money)…   My 5th anniversary with my company is fast approaching and with it comes my very first "Employee Service Award."  I received a catalog in the mail yesterday from my company containing all of the lovely gifts from which I may choose:  a lovely crystal bowl, a couple of watches, a pair of binoculars, a couple of figurines, some desk accessories, and a Samsonite tote bag.  Included in this catalog are the gift pages for the 10, 15, 20, and on up to 30 year service awards.  The 30 year service award is followed by a "Premier" service award and finally, a retirement award.  As one would guess, the gifts get nicer with the passing of each milestone.    After thumbing through the catalog and perusing all of the gifts, I am left with two observations:    1.  The luggage sets get progressively larger with the passing of each 5 year service award. 2.  The binoculars get progressively more powerful up to the 20 year award, at which point they graduate to telescopes.  I can only conclude that as the years go by, I will be in need of an extended vacation and severely near-sighted.   That is, until I retire.    On the retirement gift page sits one solitary item.  One token, that supposes to sum-up all of my years of service to this company.  The culmination of all of my hard work and decades of loyalty…  One…very large…plaque.

       It Never Fails...   ...everytime I'm outside washing my car, one of my neighbors will inevitably come over and say, "You gonna do mine next?"  Why?  Why is this asinine banter necessary?  On the outside I respond with a smile and a sarcastic, "mmmhmmm..." In my head I have turned the nozzle on the water hose to "pressure wash" and am cackling wildly as they roll around on the lawn screaming.    In my head I am saying, "You know...if you'd manage to work up a little sweat by say,  washing your car , and in the process expend more energy than that which is minimally necessary to roll out of bed and onto your couch, perhaps your ass wouldn't be so large.  *sigh*  I fear that I have made painfully evident the fact that this blog is PMSing...

       Reality TV Confession #36   The best laid plans are often thwarted by a  urlLink  Trading Spaces   marathon.  It always happens the same way.  I begin my day with the best intentions - my head a virtual itinerary of things that I will accomplish.  I flick on the tv as I'm putting on my shoes to catch the baseball scores.    What's this?  Trading Spaces is on...and it's the last ten minutes of this particular episode.  I'll just watch "the reveal" and then I'll be on my way.  Wait, what's this?   Another  episode?  I haven't seen this one...  And so it begins.  Before I know it, it's midafternoon and I'm still sitting there...barefoot.  Damn you Paige Davis!

       WHAT?!?!   An  urlLink article  from  Rollingstone.com : 	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 		Florida Band to Stage Suicide  		Hell on Earth plan to host fan's death at upcoming show  		Death on stage?  		Florida industrial rockers Hell on Earth are planning to                          host an on-stage suicide during their October 4th show                          at St. Petersburg's State Theater. A terminally ill                          member of a euthanasia society, whose identity and                          condition have not been revealed, intends to raise                          awareness for the cause of dying with dignity by                          committing suicide during the concert, according to the                          band's singer, Billy Tourtelot.                          "I support the right to die with dignity," Tourtelot                          says. "I got an email a few weeks ago from this person,                          who is a fan of the band and who stated an interest in                          doing this."                           Tourtelot, 33, says he will reveal the name of the                          person on the day of the show. "I was skeptical at                          first, but we did some research and talked to the person                          and met, and they're going to do it."                          In a press release issued Monday the fan wrote: "I thank                          the Lord that Hell on Earth is giving me this                          opportunity to end my suffering. I just want to say as                          my last will and testament that this is my God-given                          choice to end my life. I'd prefer to have a                          physician-assisted suicide but until the laws are                          changed, those who are in pain like me will either have                          to continue to suffer or do it themselves." According to                          Tourtelot, several suicide methods have been discussed,                          among them a plastic bag over the head, but the person                          has not yet decided.                           If Hell on Earth -- whose songs include "Toilet Licking                          Maggot" and "Raped by the Virgin Mary" and whose past                          stage stunts, according to Tourtelot, include having                          intercourse with cows and drinking blended rats -- go                          through with the plan, they could be hit with secondary                          felony charges for assisting in the commission of                          self-murder. The punishment for such a crime is fifteen                          years in prison, though, according to a police                          spokesperson, the statute has rarely been enforced.                          "What they're proposing to do is a crime," says Bill                          Proffitt of the St. Petersburg Police. "I don't know if                          this is a publicity stunt, but we will most likely try                          to head them off at the pass and show them the statute.                          They may not be aware that it is a crime."                           Tourtelot denies that is a publicity stunt or a crime:                          "We have legal representation, and this is not illegal.                          I'm definitely not assisting in any suicide . . . What                          I'm doing may be immoral, but it's not illegal."                          GIL KAUFMAN                         (September 17, 2003)  	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Setting aside any moral issues with euthanasia in general, if I, as an unsuspecting concert-goer, had to witness a suicide, I would be scarred for life.  And just what are they planning to do with this person's body?  Toss it into the crowd for a postmortem body-surf before rigor mortis sets in?  AND A PLASTIC BAG OVER THE HEAD?!?!  Are you kidding me?  Could anyone actually bear to watch that?  Sheeeesh...

       Helluva Weekend   I bring you - My Weekend Rundown:  The weather was gorgeous and the company was even better.   Friday :  Dinner at my favorite Mexican place -  Café Adobe , and a movie -  Underworld , with my best friend.  Wonderful evening.  TQM, Juanito.   Saturday :  Another awesome evening.  Went out boating with a friend and docked at this great little place on the water for dinner -  The Sundance Grill , then hopped back on the boat for a night-time cruise and a walk along the  urlLink boardwalk .  What a beautiful evening.  Had a blast.   Sunday :  Football (Go Texans!) and Church (Go Jesus!) and homework (Go…aaw man).  I spent some time today reflecting on this weeks Church service – the message was about enjoying and appreciating every aspect of your life - which caused me to think about my life in general and the people in it.  I came to the conclusion that I am one helluva lucky girl.  All I can do is thank God for the life that He has given me and for the people that He has allowed me to share it with.  I can honestly say that everyone that I have ever come across has been a blessing to me.  My family and friends are the obvious, but even those few that have offended me were a gift, for He used them to teach me patience, tolerance, and compassion.  God is good folks.  God is very good.    "You are my shield, my strength, my portion, deliverer, my shelter, strong tower, my very present help in time of need."

       Dear Pittsburgh,   I write to you as an Astros fan and a friend.  I realize that the Pirates being 13 games out of the NL Central lead does little to play up your sympathy for a team battling for first place, but it is September.  You know what September means to baseball fans in the middle of a pennant race.  So do us a favor?  Get out there and inspire your Pirates to sweep the Cubs for us?  Pretty please?  How about 2 out of 3 games?  See, the Astros won last night (Go ‘Stros!) and the Cubs lost (thanks Cinci) so this puts the ‘Stros and the Cubs in a tie for first.  We sure would appreciate a little support from our friends…nay…our  brothers  to the North East.  You know, often times, I will be in a public place and hear folks around here commenting that if they couldn’t live in Houston, Pittsburgh would be the place to be.  It’s true…  I ask you, what has Chicago done for you lately?  So how ‘bout it?  Help a brother out?  Sincerely,  Houston

       Reality TV Confession # 47   I watched the season premier of  urlLink The Bachelor  last night.  Pathetic, aren't I?  Shut up…  One of the girls that did not receive a rose, and in effect, received the boot, was  urlLink this girl  - Christine is her name.  Now, the other nine  bootees  took their rejection rather well, I thought, but not our girl, Christine.  My God, with all of the sobbing (and I mean  sobbing ) and heaving and carrying on that she did, you would have thought that her marriage of thirty years had just come to a cataclysmic end.  She had only spent a few minutes with the guy!  What a freak.  Good call on that one, Bob.  Frankly, I think Christine should have taken a lesson in how to handle rejection from fellow bachelorette,  urlLink Alanis Morissette .  Now,  she  handled the rejection gracefully.  I mean, taking time from her busy rockstar schedule for a chance to court Bob, only to get passed by on the first night?!  Wow.  No crocodile tears there.

       Busted   I got my first parking ticket of the fall semester last night.  I use the word, “first” to indicate that there will be subsequent parking tickets.  I unintentionally parked in  Staff Parking .  I use the word, “unintentionally” to indicate that I have been known to  intentionally  park in  Staff Parking .  I respect the fact that the Professors have paid their dues and earned their premium parking rights on campus, nevertheless, it always chaps my hide to have to park in the back forty and then walk through a half acre of empty parking spots, directly in front of the building, that are reserved for said Professors.  Besides, I only park in  Staff  when it’s raining…or when it’s cold…or when it’s hot.  But I really didn’t mean to this time.  This is my first semester at this campus and I thought that I had parked far enough out in BFE to avoid any so-called  Staff Parking  restrictions.    Apparently, I missed the signs.  Four of them.  I came out of the library and walked the fourteen miles to my car.  As I approached my vehicle, I noticed two things in rapid succession - 1:  a pink slip of paper tucked under my windshield wiper, waving in the breeze, its tongue sticking out and its fingers planted firmly in its ears as it sing-songed “nanner-nanner-nanner” at me.   2:  the campus policeman who left me the little love note two vehicles down from mine, writing another ticket and dancing a little jig, his tongue sticking out, his fingers planted firmly in his ears singing “nanner-nanner-nanner-if-you-had-come-out-here-two-minutes-earlier-you-wouldn’t-have-gotten-busted” at me.  I snatched the ticket from underneath my wiper blade and sauntered over to the officer, preparing to use my low-cut blouse and tight jeans to their full advantage.  “Hi,” I said, plastering on my best I’m-a-cute-girl-so-you-should-let-this-one-slide smile.  All the while, I was thinking, “Hey, he’s cute…I’ll be accidentally parking in  Staff  more often.”    “Hi.  What can I do for you tonight, Ma’am?”  You can start by giving me your phone number.  I held up my ticket.  “I guess I’m not supposed to park here, huh?” “No…sorry.  This area is reserved for  Faculty Parking .” “So it seems.  This is my first semester on this campus… you should give me a tour ”  This is where he was  supposed  to fall prey to my siren song and let me off the hook.  Instead, he illuminated the  Faculty Parking  signs (that I had driven straight through) with his flashlight.    “There are signs.  Four of them.”  Damn gay Campus Policemen…

       Survivor Office Pool Update    urlLink My guy’s  still there!  Unfortunately, I’m rooting for the  other  tribe.  I hate to jump to conclusions this early in the game, but based on what I saw tonight, it looks like Ryan Opray (my guy) is going to be this season’s Mister Cellophane.  There’s one every season – that guy/girl who hangs out in the background, virtually unnoticed by the viewers except for that occasional chance glimpse of them as the camera pans past them to focus on something more interesting like tree bark or mosquitos.  They appear on camera just long enough for you to think, “Who the hell is that?” immediately followed by, “Oh look!  A monkey!”   In case you were wondering about the first schmuck voted off the island, it was Nicole - The Whiney Drama-Queen.  Yes, that is her official title.  I would also like to take this opportunity to nominate Rupert as tonight’s Episode Hero.  Rupert, who, in capturing the true spirit of this year’s pirate theme, plundered the opposing team’s shoes and bartered them for fruit.  Rupert, who speared six fish for the Drake tribe.  Rupert, the big burly SOB in the baby blue skirt.  Rock on, Rupert!  Fìn.

Baseball Tonight barely mentioned them.  Instead, they focused on the 2nd place Chicago Cubs.  Come on ESPN.  What gives?

For instance, someone recently visited this jolly little blog by keying the following into a  Google  search prompt:  “horny wranglers guys”  Since the proprietor of this blog is neither a wrangler nor a guy, I can only imagine the bitter disappointment of this person as they sat there in their underwear at 3am with beads of anticipation-sweat pooling under their armpits.  I realize that using the words “horny wranglers guys” in conjunction in this post (twice now) will only cause this blog to be moved higher on the list of matches for searches containing the words “horny wranglers guys” (three times), so allow me to take this opportunity to reach out to my newfound demographic.   I say to you whom have stumbled upon my blog while searching for horny wranglers:   Hold on now.  Wait a minute.  Don’t go away.  Put down your jar of Vaseline and wad of toilet paper.  Sit back for a moment and enjoy a good read.  You surely will not find any pictures of sweaty cowboy man-meat here, but my blog is simple yet informative and mildly entertaining.  Also, the odds of chafing anything or developing prickly heat while cruising through these pages is almost nonexistent...almost.  So go on, gentle reader...read on.

       Blues Clues   Remember this name:  urlLink  Joe Bonamassa      This man is going to be a legend.  He opened the Peter Frampton show tonight.  Joe is one bad bad blues man.  He had the crowd on their feet and hanging on every wicked lick.  He's also got one hell of a voice.  Powerful and gravelly - a dirty blues kind of voice.  He did a few songs off of his new album,  urlLink  Blues Deluxe .  In a word:  awesome!  He puts on a great show.   What was that name again?  That's right...Joe Bonamassa.  Don't you forget it!   Rock on, Joe!  You made a fan out of me.  Oh...yeah, Peter Frampton was there too...big whoop.  I'm not a fan of him at all.    Peace, Love, and Crabs y'all...

       Funny Funny Men   I worked security at the  urlLink Comedy Central Live Tour  last night.  The tour features  urlLink Mitch Hedberg ,  Insomniac   urlLink Dave Attell , and  The Daily Show 's  urlLink Lewis Black .     What an absolute riot!  I nearly peed myself.  Mitch was my favorite.    After the show I got to meet Dave Attell and got his autograph for my brother.  I love his show,  Insomniac , on Comedy Central.  Watch his show, dammit!  He's a nice guy!    He hung around after the show signing literally anything people would bring him and taking pictures with fans.  He even stood outside and had a cigarette and chatted with people.  Did I mention that I love this security gig?    On tap for tonight...Peter Frampton!  Ha!  This is going to be one of those shows that I go into thinking that it's going to be hokey and end up knowing every single freakin' song and loving it.  I'll let you all know tomorrow.  Peace, Love, and Crabs.  (ps:  I just ran Blogger's new spellcheck feature and it wanted to replace " freakin' " with " foreskin .")

       Remember Next Week…   I, for one, am tired of reading all of the “Never-Forget” emails today and seeing those ash covered faces on every news site and paper under the banner:  “America Remembers.”    As if anyone could ever forget.  Tomorrow these same sites and papers will all go back to reporting the real news:  JEN AND BEN’S WEDDING POSTPONED!  And where was all of this patriotism throughout the rest of the year?  Hell, where was it yesterday?  It’s like those people who are suddenly stricken with religion on Christmas and Easter.  Man, this blog is awfully bitchy tonight...

       Reality TV Confession # 53…    Survivor …it’s starts the 18th of this month.  There is a perfectly good mortician on the show this season, and I wind up with the Boo Berry Cereal guy who “is most proud of having had many jobs.”  Sounds like you’ve been fired a lot, dude…  By (un)luck of the draw, I have pulled  urlLink Ryan Opray ’s name out of the proverbial hat in the office Survivor pool (yes, we have one of those).  He’s my guy this season.  If he winds up being the ultimate survivor, I get  oodles  of dough.  If he is the first schmuck cast off of the island - and let’s face it folks, this is a very real possibility for a guy whose other favorites include:    Playboy , Beef Jerky, and Jack Daniels - I am rewarded with a season full of snickers, giggles, and sideline viewing.  So come on you guys…say it loud and say it proud:  GOOOO Ryan!

       Blog Tired   It’s Friday and once again, I’ve failed to post a single thing this week (excluding Monday, but that was a holiday).  Between work, school, and my security side gig I’ve just not found the time or the inclination.  Also, my life is supremely uninteresting these days.  I suggest that you scamper off and read two of my favorite blogs until I can drum up some minimally interesting content or some maximally fascinating lies.  The World’s Funniest Blog:   urlLink  Dave Barry’s Blog   The World’s Bitchiest Blog:   urlLink  Rabbit Blog   What are you still doing here?  Scamper dammit!

       Twirlin' My Growl Towel   On Saturday night I worked a security gig at Robertson Stadium: The University of Houston Cougars vs Rice University's Owls (both local schools).  Go Coogs!  You didn't think that a silly little tropical storm was going to get in the way of Texas football, did you?!?  It was a trouncing, if ever I saw one.  Final score:  Cougars: 48, Owls: 14.  Luckily, we didn't get much rain during the game.  Not that it really would have mattered, since yours truly was assigned to guard  The Luxury Suites  at the stadium - and by guard I mean stand around and meet and greet all the local politicians and rich folk and get all kinds of goodies.  Hee!  From all of this schmoozing I took away a bit of inspiration - my very own fragrance.  I shall call it simply,  Money  and it will smell like silk ties and hair coloring with the slightest hint of menthol.  I despise politicians and avoid being drawn into political debates with friends or strangers by any means necessary (including, but not limited to plugging my fingers into my ears and chanting, "aaalalalalalala" and that old beloved fail-safe - "No hablo ingles").  So you can imagine my delight when a certain politician - I will withhold her name, however, suffice to say that were I to take the time to compile a list of the politicians that disgust me the most, her name would appear multiple times - attempted to waltz right around me and into the suites without first presenting for me a pass.    Now, I knew very well who she was - being the camera-whore that she is, it would be nearly impossible for me to have not recognized her - and I could have let it go.  However, rather than being remiss in my duties in protecting the general well being of the public by not requesting to view her pass (and subsequently giving her whatever miniscule satisfaction she would have drawn from the slightest indication that I knew who she was), I smiled and very sweetly said, "Excuse me, ma'am?  May I please see your pass?"    He he he...  She whirled around haughtily, attempting to melt me with the lasers of contempt and indignation beaming from her eyes.  Her expression was priceless!  I continued to smile as she rummaged roughly through her purse for her credential.  Inside I was giddy with the anticipation of possibly being able to further detain her if she could not produce her pass.  Alas...she found it.  She ripped it from her purse and held it to my face with a bitter scowl.  I stifled the urge to take it from her and study it closely for several minutes.  Instead I peered around her outstretched hand, knuckles white from the scornful grip she had on her pass, and grinned ear-to-ear as I wished her a lovely evening.  She shot daggers at me.  I shot my best Colgate-smile at her.    I love this job...

       Tru Dat, Yo   Tonight was a big TV watching night for me.    I watched the premier of  Tru Calling  starring Eliza Dushku.  I won’t get into a synopsis of the show, because if you didn’t watch it, then you won’t get half of what I’m talking about.  But hey, look, the show even has a  urlLink blog .  First thing’s first - can we get Tru a car?  I mean, I understand that she just graduated from college and is strapped for cash, but how about writing in a little old used something for her?  Maybe Granpa’s old Pinto?  Perhaps even a Vespa?  A 10-speed?  Cab fare for crying out loud?  Get the girl some kind of mode of transportation!  There must have been at least 18 scenes of Eliza running.  Run-run-running hither and thither.  It’s no wonder they emphasized her character’s former track-star status from the beginning.  I was exhausted just watching her.  Thank goodness the morgue, her sister’s office, her brother’s hang-out, the hospital, the restaurant, the bar, the apartment and the university were all conveniently situated within sprinting distance.  Then there’s the issue of her acting.  Ok ok, I’ll be nice.  She’s not a horrible actress.  I liked her as Faith on  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and I liked her in  Bring It On.   Heck, I even liked her in  Wrong Turn  even though the movie itself bit.  My issue is this:  she always has that same damn look on her face.  You know the one – like she’s trying to do long division in her head.  Her brow furrows and her eyes glaze over.    Eliza, show me fear…Action!  *ok…ok…697 divided by 17*…Aaaaand cut! Ok, Eliza, now you’ve just found your brother beaten within an inch of his life…Action!  *ummm….ummm…451 divided by 14*…Aaaaand cut!  Frankly, I thought the show was a little cheesy and given Fox’s quick-with-the-guillotine past when it comes to new shows, I give  Tru Calling  about four episodes before it’s pulled.  A network like The WB or UPN maybe would give it more of a shot, but on a Thursday night opposite  Survivor  and the final season of  Friends …not a snowball’s chance in h-e-double-hockey-sticks.  And since I’m on the subject of television…I also watched  Survivor  tonight and I'm happy to announce that my guy’s still in it!  Good ol’ Ryan O’ has outlasted, outwitted, outplayed…ok ok, so he’s  outlasted  longer than I thought.  Now, if we can just finagle him into the final two so I can get some money out of this…once again, not a snowball’s chance in h-e-double-hockey-sticks.  Good night, y’all.  I’m off to bed to read a book that  urlLink PDawg  recommended:   Postmortem , by Patricia Cornwell.  I’m about halfway through and I’m diggin’ it PDiddy.  Thanks!

       Traumatized   A coworker licked my face today.  Well, not in so much as his tongue touched my skin, but it may as well have.  I was chatting with him in his cubicle when it happened.  It was a smudge, a smear, a speck.  I had been rubbing my eye so perhaps it was a dab of makeup or a bit of ink from the marker that I had been writing with that morning.  Regardless…he licked my face.  Right there in the corner of my eye socket.  Before I could raise a defensive arm or instinctive knee to the groin, he licked his finger and used his saliva to remove whatever it was on my face that had guided me into this misfortune.  I stood there for a moment, fighting my every urge to run screaming down the hall and into the ladies room to scrub my face.  I could not, however, stop myself from wiping my face with an exaggerated swipe akin to the way a child will wipe away the kisses of their overzealous Aunt Mildred.  It’s not that I have any sort of phobia regarding germs (I am sure that there is a word for this that I am obviously too lazy to look up) - although I have been known to carry my own toilet seat covers and to kick the handle of a public toilet rather than use my hand to flush – it’s just that this was the alien spit of a  coworker , as opposed to the more familiar spit of my family and friends.  That’s just nasty.  Don’t do that.  Do not, under any circumstances, rub your saliva on the face of someone that you know only casually.  I managed to maintain my composure long enough to  thank  the little freak and walk shuddering down to my office where I could gag in privacy.  *letch*

       Not Just Any Fish Tale      The Marlins beat the Yankees in six.  The Marlins, who were supposed to be swept by the mighty Yankees, beat the Yankees in six.  The Marlins, who, if you ask anyone in Chicago, wouldn't have been in the World Series if it weren't for  the fan , beat the Yankees in six.  And what a Game 6 it was.  Two Texas boys facing off on the mound.  Josh Beckett from Spring, Texas vs. Andy Pettitte from Deer Park, Texas (incidently, Andy graduated from the same highschool that I did, in the same graduating class as my brother and sister, and lives just about 10 minutes from me...sorry, Andy, my heart was with my Fish).    Josh Josh Josh!  You shut 'em out, baby!  Josh Beckett went all nine innings for the Marlins last night.  Pudge called every pitch and Josh executed with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel.    Hey!  You people in Florida better start getting your butts to Pro Player Stadium and supporting your team!  These boys deserve it.  Alas...this moment is bittersweet for me.  The Marlins won, yes, but the victory last night signifies the end of baseball until April.    *sigh*    I suppose I will watch hockey.  After all, my  urlLink  Aeros  are the defending champs again...but my mind will be on next April.

       The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men Go Oft Astray…   Tomorrow is my best friend,  urlLink  Juan’s  birthday.  Saturday is our regular church night and with Juan newly assigned to the church choir, there is all the more reason to attend (not that I needed any).   urlLink Ashley , my brother’s girlfriend and friend to both Juan and I, decided to attend church with me tomorrow night so that she and I could take him out for a late birthday dinner at a restaurant that will sufficiently humiliate him with obnoxious singing and funny hats.  One of the things that I have truly cherished about my friendship with Juan over the years, is his uncanny ability to unwittingly thrust himself into the center of the largest conundrums ever witnessed by man.  Somehow, my little buddy has managed to arrange for not only Ash and I to be present at his birthday celebration, but also the girl that he is currently dating - which would be fine except for the facts that a) she has a history of not liking me and b) Juan's ex-girlfriend (who still has feelings for him) will be present as well.    Aaah, but wait...this gets better.  Juan's two sisters will be joining the party.  Juan's two sisters do not like is ex-girlfriend (actually they hate her with a passion that, while wildly amusing for me to hear about, is not something that I necessarily ever wanted to witness).    For those of you not taking notes, what we have here is the ex-girlfriend sitting very near, if not right next to the new flame; the new flame who may or may not harbor ill feelings toward me sitting very near, if not right next to me; the sisters who dislike the ex-girlfriend sitting very near, if not right next to her; and Ash sitting back with a bucket of popcorn and a large soda enjoying the show.  Tune in some time on Sunday to find out how this one plays out.  If, per chance, there is no such post found here…I am either dead or in jail - the latter coming to pass as a result of my kicking the ass of anyone who does anything to ruin my friend’s birthday.

       Thummose Wummere the Dummays   Last night I was chatting with a friend about childhood memories.  It’s funny sometimes, the things from our childhood that we carry into our adult years.  When I think of being a kid, one memory in particular always comes to mind first.  It’s of watching Saturday morning cartoons with my brother.  I guess I was probably around eight or nine years old.  My brother and I used to get up at the butt-crack of dawn on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons - when Saturday morning cartoons were still worth getting up for, that is.  He would come into my room and wake me up, and we would drag our blankets and pillows out to the living room while everyone else was still asleep and turn on the ‘toons.  We used to drink  Quik  too, except we didn’t call it  Quik .  We called it “bunny milk.”  He would always drink the chocolate and I would always drink the strawberry.  I even remember what kind of cups we used to have – they were tall, plastic, pastel colored cups.  We would make our bunny milk so that no matter how much you stirred it up, there was still like an inch of sugar at the bottom of the cup, and when you were finished drinking the milk, you had this glob of syrupy stuff left.  It was great.  If memory serves, we used to start our mornings with  The Smurfs , followed by  The Gummi Bears .  We would sing all of the words to the Gummi Bears theme song before it even started, and talk about what we would do if we had  real  gummiberry juice.  Man, I tell you…those were the days.   Dashing and daring, Courageous and caring, Faithful and friendly, With stories to share. All through the forest, They sing out in chorus, Marching along, As their song fills the air.  Gummi Bears, Bouncing here and there and everywhere. High adventure that's beyond compare, They are the Gummi Bears…

       Super Saturday   It's Saturday and the weather is gorgeous!!  So naturally most, if not all of my day will be spent indoors.    I will be getting all spiffied up here shortly (I actually do that from time to time) for my friend's wedding this afternoon.  I'm going with my best friend.  He's already two inches shorter than me, and the three inch heels I will be wearing with my dress should make for an interesting afternoon.    Following the wedding  inside  the church is the reception  inside  the hall.  After the wedding and the partying, Shorty and I will be meeting some friends at  urlLink  our church , as Saturday night is church night.  Once again... indoors .    After church we're going to rush out and catch the late showing of  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre .    Thank you, Jesus.  Amen.  Now on with the bloody, chainsawed bodies!  Yeah baby!

       Mad About Madea   Man, I am just having the best time working  urlLink  Tyler Perry's   Madea's Class Reunion .     Its    It's   Its - dammit!  I was just cruising through  urlLink  The Procrastinatrix's  blog (I got there from  urlLink  PDawg's  blog) and one of her posts mentioned something about the proper use of  it's  versus  its .  Now I'm questioning myself.  Dammit...  Anyway, back to Madea...the show's stint in Houston runs from last Tuesday through this Sunday.  Nine shows in all.  I'd advise that, if you are in the area, you rush out and buy tickets, but it's sold out.  Every show.    By the time the show leaves town I will have seen it four times and still be ready to see it another four.  It's  that  good.  I can't get over the vocal acrobatics of the cast.  My goodness, those people can sing!  Holy crap, Batman!  Oh yeah, and I met Kelly Rowland last night.  She came to see the show.  I know, big whoop.  It was funny, I was seating people all around her, and either nobody recognized her, or nobody cared.   It's not like she's Beyonce...

       Busy Little Dweeb   Whew!  It's been a busy week, kiddos.  It's been work, school, other work, baseball (GO MARLINS!!), my best friend's audition for the Lakewood Choir (he made it!), a lovely evening involving dinner and a movie...er...dinner  urlLink  during   a movie, and more work and other work.    Sheeeesh!  Work is work as usual.  Other work involved security at the Rockets game this week and tonight I am working a musical:   Madea's Class Reunion .  I sincerely hope that it is a good show as I will be working this gig FOUR times.  The dinner and movie date was last night.  We saw  Kill Bill .  In a word...EXCELLENT.  It was the bloodiest movie I have ever seen and I loved every minute of it!  The production was just really well done.  It's classic quirky Tarantino, and I must say, he outdid himself this go 'round.  I can't wait for Vol 2.  I haven't enough thumbs for this one, so I will recruit my big toes and give it a whopping 4 thumbs up!  I have decided to kick my slacking up a notch and take a vacation day tomorrow.  I will not be in the office, but fear not....Milton stands fast.    Hmm...if only I could teach Milton to blog for me...

        If necessity is the mother of invention, then curiosity is the stepchild of stupidity   I just  had  to know what was in that nifty little stress ball on my desk.  It was a little yellow stress ball with stubby little yellow arms and stubby little yellow legs, no bigger than a tennis ball.  That is, it  was  before I opened it up to see what the squishy stuff inside was.    I couldn’t just leave well enough alone.  It wasn’t Play-Doh as I suspected.  It was  sand .  Black sand.  Actually, upon further inspection, I believe that it may be some sort of pulverized rubber.  I know this because it’s all over my desk now.  Oops.  Not to worry.  All is not lost.  It was actually no more than a balloon filled with the black sandy rubbery stuff, then vacuum packed and tied at the top.  I merely undid the knot and, upon making a mess and realizing that I had no means of re-vacuum packing it...I blew it up!  Hee!    So now I have a stress  balloon  and, though no longer fit to function in it’s intended manner, looking at it cracks me up, and that’s stress relief, right?!    I named him Milton, by the way ( excuse me, I believe you have my stapler ).  And the little bit of black sandy rubbery stuff that didn’t spill out all over my desk remains in Milton’s bottom causing him to sit up straight!  You may be wondering if all of this could be a direct result of the “Mountain Dew Latte” that I concocted this morning (see previous post).  Sadly, no…this is quite typical of my fumbling inquisitive nature, but if anyone asks - it was the caffeine O.D.  Scary, ain’t it?  Oh hey…check this post again tonight!  I will edit it to add pictures of Milton on my desk.    Peace love & crabs, y’all.

       I Feel Like Crap   Man alive!  I got my flu shot yesterday and have been flapping my wing ever since.  My arm is killing me and I feel like crap too.  The stink of it is that I went over yesterday morning, got my flu shot and then came back to the office and read in the paper that a.) Houston is getting hit with the flu early this year and b.) the flu shot is not helping this particular strain.  Dammit…  Anyway, my point, and I  do  have one, is that I am totally torn between Meredith and Kelly-Jo on  The Bachelor .  Meredith seems like just an all around nice girl and my heart went out to her, having lost her grandmother while being away from her family.  Kelly-Jo just seems like a lot of fun.  She’s not so prissy and she likes to have a good time.  For the most part, I think the entire group this season is just a better group of girls than in the past.  They seem to be significantly less annoying than their predecessors…for the most part.   Then there’s Leeann.  The wretched, evil, little shrew who casts a shadow on the other, nicer girls.  Stay away from her Bob!  Shield your eyes.  Run away and don’t look back no matter how much she makes out with you on next week’s episode.  Leeann spent much of last night’s episode alternating between pouting because she wasn’t voted “most compatible” with Bob, pouting at the thought that she may have been voted “least compatible” with Bob, and generally pissing off the rest of the girls with a rant about how jealous everyone is of her.  Can they vote her off the island?   Or maybe pour a little Turbo-Lax in her tea just before her date with Bob (a la  Dumb and Dumber )?   Even with the kicking and the scratching during the initial drag up the stairs,  urlLink defenestration  would be wildly exciting to watch and certainly worth the risk.  There’s a ratings booster if I ever heard one…

       Coming Soon...   I'm thinking of changing up my blog layout a little...or alot.  Yes, I know, this would mark the third layout in about as many months, but I can be so fickle with things like this.  I'm also thinking of changing the title.  I never liked that title -  End of the Internet  - it's dumb.  Besides, changing it would quell the large number of people who wind up here by actually searching for "the end of the internet" via Google or some other search engine...of course, I suppose that would do nothing to lessen the number of folks who get here by searching for "horny wranglers."  Hmm...  I am open to suggestions and feedback, positive or otherwise as long as the criticism is constructive.  I must warn you, however, non-constructive comments are liable to cause a  urlLink vitriolic  rant...and nobody wants that.

       Fine!   Alright alright...  So I haven't posted in several days.  Big deal.  With the exception of two, maybe three people (on a good day), nobody really means to wind up here.  And it IS my blog, you know.  I am free to post or not post at my whimsy.    Finefinefine!  I'll post something!  Geeez, get off my back already!  I DO have a life outside of this blog.  I have work and school and a side job and friends and family.  Gaaaah!  Stop judging me!  If you weren't so dang finger-pointy to begin with, we wouldn't be having this discussion!    What do you mean you didn't say anything?!?!  Let me tell you something...you don't have to flap your jaws to communicate!  Your silence says it all, Charlie Chaplin!  That's it.  I give up.  I don't have the time or the inclination to deal with you.  I'll post, but not because you screamed at me in silence.  I'll post because this is  my  blog and I feel like posting now.    Soooo...how 'bout those Marlins?    Pudge is the man!  Florida's goin' all the way this year.  You heard it here first, folks (ok, maybe not, but you're hearing it again now).  I've been rooting for the Marlins (my other home team) since my 'Stros were eliminated.  Forget  CSI ,  Without a Trace ,  ER , and the like.  If you're looking for real drama, people, tune into one of the several AWESOME post-season games going on in MLB.      If you are not a baseball fan, first, what the hell is wrong with you?  And second, you are missing out on some epic battles this year.  On the menu tonight:  Florida Marlins vs. Chicago Cubs.  It's Willis vs. Zambrano!  This is going to be a pitcher's dual.  I can't wait!  ~Fìn

       What's On Tap   It's going to be an action-packed weekend:   Friday :  In honor of the Halloween season and our love of horror movies, my best friend and I have a classic horror movie marathon planned for tonight.  Well, classic for me and the rest of the world - save a small population of pygmies in the Republic of Cameroon...and my best friend who has not seen any good horror movie.  And by  good  I mean those movies that do not feature giant alligators or backward-swimming super-intelligent sharks.    We will begin the evening with  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  (mostly because a:  he hasn't seen it, and b:  we are both eagerly awaiting the release of the newest version of the movie on October 17th), followed immediately by  The Shining  (a personal fave of mine and again, he hasn't seen it), followed immediately by our feature presentation:   The Exorcist .  We will sit huddled in front of the television with our eyes half shielded and our mouths full of pizza.  Hee!  It's going to be a fun night!   Saturday :  Laundry and errand day for me.  I need to go pick up a gift for an upcoming wedding (not mine) and do some other shopping and puttering about.  In the evening I will go to church with some friends.   Sunday :  RENFEST DAY!!!  Wheeeeeeee!  I love the  urlLink Renaissance Festival !  I go every year, usually twice and sometimes three times.  It's just impossible to see all of the shows in one day, and plus, I get such a kick out of the atmosphere.  This year, I will be participating in the  King's Feast  for the first time and it looks like the weather will be absolutely gorgeous.  Pictures to follow...  Somewhere in all of this, I will have to find time to study and get my photoblog setup so that I can share my RenFest pictures with my faithful few readers.  I am going to be one weary wench come Monday morning.  It's all good times, though!  Peace out...er...Fare thee well!

       Slacker    I’m very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical, I understand equations both the simple and quadratical, About binomial theorem I am teaming with a lot of news, With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.   (William S. Gilbert,  The Pirates of Penzance , 1880)  Throughout this long holiday weekend, I have been trying to get my  Discrete Math  homework done (it’s due on Monday night).  Finals are a little over one week away and I am behind.  I am a slacker.  I freely admit this.  I have been off from work since Wednesday, and will return on Monday morning.  I did no homework on Wednesday because, well, it was the first day of a five day vacation from work.  I had to relax.  Besides, I had plenty of time.  Thursday was Thanksgiving.  I did no work on Thursday because, well, I was busy giving thanks and spending time with my family and participating in a gluttonous game of pass-the-yams.  I had to relax.  Besides, I had plenty of time.  Yesterday, I did manage to get some work done, but between pausing to blog, pausing to play with Mr. Stinkers (the cat), pausing to eat leftovers, pausing to watch  Judge Joe Brown , pausing to nap, and pausing to watch  T3: Rise of the Machines , I didn’t manage to get as much done as I had planned.  Go figure.  Today, I got up early, once again, determined to get some work done.  And I have.  Some.  Yet here I sit, blogging instead of working, and, in approximately two hours, I will be leaving for the Auto Show with some friends and then heading to church.  Perhaps I will pray for the kick in the ass that I deserve for putting off all of this work.  Tomorrow, I am working all day.  I have to be out at Reliant Stadium at 7am, because, well, that’s when the tailgaters begin to arrive.  I should be home by 5 pm.  6 pm at the latest.  I have plenty of time.     *faints*

       I Had Cheesecake for Breakfast   It’s the day after Thanksgiving and you know what that means:  leftovers!  Turkey sandwich, turkey salad, turkey soup, stuffing, and around my house – arroz con gandules, yucca, flan…  For a lot of people, the day after Thanksgiving also means:  shopping!  Not me.  Uh-uh.  No freaking way.  Don’t get me wrong - it’s not that I don’t like to shop, because, let’s face it, I’m a woman.  I was born with the shopping gene, which causes me to gravitate toward shoe sales and instinctively park at the opposite end of the mall from where I know that the item I came to purchase is located.  I have been clocked at charging speeds in excess of 150 mph, however, I flatly refuse to join the madness that is the  Biggest Shopping Day of the Year .  Actually, I find myself doing more and more shopping online.  Department store shopping has become more sport than necessity for me and those trips to the mall are, of late, more of a social occasion, satisfying the urge for us girls to  hunt  shop in packs.  The advent of the internet with its 24-hour, everything-under-the-sun, shopping and its next-day shipping, and its secure online payment option may very well become the bane of society as we know it….nah!  Not as long there are  Foley’s Red Apple Sales !

       What’s On Tap   Today is Friday!  Wheeeeeee!!!  Oh don’t worry, I’m still ticked about the butt-load of work that I have to do today (slide your eyeballs down one post), but I’ve never been one to stay mad for more than five minutes at a time.  Tonight is date night.  Mmmhmm…I said it.  I have a date.  I have an evening of boating and fine dining in store.  The weather has been absolutely  gorgeous  lately.  It’s going to be such a lovely evening.  Tomorrow I will be studying, going to my thirteen-year-old niece’s softball tournament, and studying  at  my thirteen-year-old niece’s softball tournament.  Afterwards, I’ll head to church with date-guy and some friends and then possibly for a bite to eat after the service.  Sunday:  working the side gig.  I will be overseeing the general well being of the public at the  urlLink  Verizon Wireless Theater  (not at the Texans game as I had planned).  It’s just as well, though.  I really wanted to see this play -  Why Did I Get Married?  (sorry, couldn’t find a link to it), and now I get to see it twice, as I will be working both shows on Sunday.  That’s the plan, Stan.  Six days until Turkey Day!  Woo hoo!    Happy weekend, Y’all!

       Today is Friday, Dammit!    If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."  *  Today is Friday, dammit!  As a self-proclaimed slacker (ok, so others have brought this fact to my attention as well), I should be enjoying a heightened state of slackery and experiencing an increase in personal dawdling and else-doing.    I had hardly enough time to thoroughly express my outrage over last night’s episode of  Survivor  during our weekly office  Friday-Morning-Round-Table-Survivor-Debate , before I was forced to dive into the piles of work on my desk.  "The cause of the pile-up" you ask?   Meetings!   I had Five (5) of them yesterday!  Five scheduled instances of formal group non-productivity!  Today, I have no meetings because it is Friday and Friday is set aside for slacking and newspaper reading and general nonsensical behavior - none of which I am participating in (well, not on the grand scale that is normally reserved for Fridays, anyway) due to the mountain of paperwork on my desk.  Ok there.  I’m done bitching about work.  I feel better.  Don’t you?   *  To whom ever sent me this quote (or something to this effect, seeing as I am quite sure that I butchered the original) last week:  thank you.  I apologize for not remembering, who, specifically.  Please forgive me, I have slept since last week.

       Reality TV Confession # 49   Last night, Bob chose to spurn cool, pretty, funny, sweet Kelly-Jo, in favor of a non-proposal to mousy, elfish, annoying, baby-talking Estella.  You’re an idiot, Bob, with your idiot laugh and your idiot nose and your idiot hair.  Tonight, in a shocking turn of events (well, for him anyway), Rupert was cast off the island through a conspiracy between back-stabbing Burton and that little weasel Jon.  Bastards...     I can’t take many more stunning disappointments.  If Malena forsakes Adam for one of the hot "new" guys, I may almost vow to never watch reality TV again…almost.   If you understood this post without hesitation, congratulations...you are an RTVJ (Reality TV Junkie) like me.  Don't be ashamed, revel in it.

Thusly, it is my duty to inform you that we, here at The End of the Internet, take a firm stance against Mondays*.

       Survivor Office Pool Update   Dammit…  Well,  urlLink my guy ’s out.  To tell you the truth, I’m surprised the little dumbass made it as far as he did.  I took one look at his bio and let go all aspirations of winning this thing before the show even started.  I’ve been cheering for Rupert since Day 1, anyway.  Can I get a ROOP ROOP?!?!  In other, more pressing news…I got my hair cut this afternoon.  It’s short.  Really short.  I don’t know that I like it, so when you see me, be sure and go out of your way to tell me how much I  don’t  look like a little boy who’s been playing dress up in his sister’s closet.  I’ve been going to the same hairstylist for about five years now.  I see her roughly every six to eight weeks, and I’ve found that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time I spend in her chair and the amount of personal information that I am willing to reveal.  In roughly one hour, we catch up on two months of each other’s personal lives.  Our criminal prosecution system has got it all wrong.  There’s no need to “good cop / bad cop” a confession out of someone.  All questioning should be done in a salon, in a chair that tilts back, with the suspect’s head over a sink and warm water running over their heads.  They’ll sing like the fat lady never did.

       Surreal Life   Last night I saw something that I have been waiting my entire life to witness:  Men.  Dozens of men…  …standing in line for the restroom.  I was at a concert last night where the men outnumbered the women 10:1.  There was no line at the ladies room.  Women were free to roam in and out and potty at their whimsy.  At first, a few ladies stood in line out of sheer force of habit before realizing that the restroom was actually empty.  It was as if  Porcelina, Goddess of Lavatories , smiled upon them and said, “Come forth my daughters, there is room here.”   Meanwhile, the men, relegated to “the line,” were the picture of poetic justice.  Some of them were even shifting foot-to-foot with their hands over their privates, simulating a sort of surreal pee-pee dance.  Several of us ladies just stood there, huddled together in motionless silence, trying desperately to preserve the moment.  Others pointed and laughed.  My favorite, by far, was the lady who went skipping past the line of whimpering men and into the ladies room singing, “Look at me!  I’m going to pee!”  It’s the little things, the small joys, that make life grand.

       Fainting and Vomit and Brawls, Oh My!   The crowd at  urlLink   The Strokes   show on Friday night was…interesting, to say the least.  I should have known this night would be special when I arrived at the Verizon two hours before the show would begin only to find a line of fans that spanned several city blocks (many of them dressed in fishnets and tinfoil…that’s right -  tinfoil ), waiting for the doors to open.  I hate general admission seating.  I picked my way through the crowd and into the venue, then got my security garb on and sat and watched the bands warm up for about an hour.   urlLink  Regina Spektor  was the show opener.  I had never heard of her, but her voice reminded me of  Bjork .   urlLink   Kings of Leon  were up next.  They were alright, I guess, though I’m not going to rush out and buy their album (Neither will I take my time and  eventually  buy their album).  I watched  The Strokes  warm up a couple of songs (including a Julian Casablancas / Regina Spektor duet) before heading out to the front doors to await the tidal wave of misunderstood youth that would be pouring in.  If you haven’t been to a concert or sporting event in a while, you may be surprised to find that the days of ticket-tearing are over.  Handheld scanners are now used to scan a barcode found at the bottom of every ticket.  One click and two beeps later, you’re in…unless of course you try to pass off a bogus ticket or a ticket that has already been scanned, which someone has already used to get in and, thinking that since the ticket is not torn, they can give or scalp it to you, which you stupidly take or buy and then hand to me to scan, causing my little scanner to go, “beep-blaaaaaat” and a message to pop up that says, “ticket already used,” and I look at you and say, “Where’d you get this ticket?”, and you stupidly reply, “Uh…um…I just bought this at the box office,” and I say to you, “No you didn’t…the show’s sold out.  Get outta here.”  In other  Friday Night at The Strokes Show  news - I’m an idiot.  No, really.  I am.  As I was scanning tickets, and giving exasperated shouts of, “HAVE YOUR TICKETS OUT FOLKS!” one of the security supervisors walked up with four guys and asked them to wait just inside the door behind me.  At this point there was a lull in the crowd of people coming in, and one of them said to me, “Busy night?”  “Yes, very, and quite an interesting crowd,” I replied.  So the five of us stood there and chatted for a couple of minutes about the sold-out show and the kids coming in.  We all had a good chuckle about the tin-foil people.  A minute later the security super came back, this time with the owner of the Verizon in tow, who handed each one of the guys an  All Access  pass and said, “Right this way, guys.”  We said our goodbyes and I continued scanning people in.  A bit later I inquired to said supervisor about who those guys were.  “Oh,” he said, “That was  Third Eye Blind .  They were playing next door at  Bar Houston  and wanted to check out the show.”    *Mental head slap*     I can’t believe I didn’t recognize them.  I really need to watch more MTV.  Hey…that would be a good name for a band - “Up next, we’ve got  Mental Head Slap  with their debut single, “I’m An Idiot.”   Anyway, I missed the opening two bands because people just would not stop coming in.  Judging by their rehearsal and the amount of people standing outside smoking during their sets, I think it’s safe to say that I didn’t miss much.   The Strokes  took the stage an hour late.  That’s just ridiculous to me.  You have a couple thousand people standing pressed together like sardines, waiting to see you.  Your asses should be on that stage on time.  People where getting hot, hence, the fainting.  People were getting more and more drunk, hence, the vomiting.  People were getting pissed, hence, the brawl.  I caught the entire Strokes show from a speaker platform, atop which my presence alone was meant to dissuade people from climbing.  I had an excellent view of both the stage and the sea of people that  did  pay to see the show below me.  For the most part it worked, although I did have one guy climb up and try to do “the bump” with me and several other people who climbed up to get a better view.  They were all gently persuaded to climb back down by a hand on their backs and a flashlight in their faces.  I don’t know much about  The Strokes , except that I never understood what the big deal was all about.  I think they’re ok.  I bought their first album,  Is This It?  and the only song that I ever really liked on it was, “Last Night.”  Actually, I’d forgotten how much I liked that song until they sang it at the show.  It’s a catchy little tune.  The rest of their set all sounded the same to me.  Every song.  And if I pay to see a show, then entertain me, dammit (yes, I know I didn’t pay to see this show, but that’s beside the point).  These guys just stood there.  All of them.  Up until the closing of the last song, when he jumped into the crowd, Julian Casablancas’ movement on stage was limited to sipping his drink and lighting another cigarette.  He literally just stood there.  The crowd seemed to be into it, though, so what the heck do I know?  Peace out, Y’all.

       What’s On Tap   After work today, I’ll be heading down to the  urlLink Verizon Wireless Theater   to work security at  The Strokes’  show.  Yeah, ok, very funny.  I know what you’re thinking.  And so what if I’m only 5’6” and a 125 pounds?  I’m tougher than I look and I can appear quite menacing while radioing for police backup.  Tomorrow will be a day of four-wheelin’ dating fun!  Yeeehaaw, baby!  Yeah, ok, very funny.  I know what you’re thinking.  And as a matter of fact I  do  date, and so what if I’ve never been on a four-wheeler before?  I’m stronger than I look and I can appear rather attractive while strapped to a gurney.  Afterwards I’ll have to run home, pick the underbrush out of my hair and get cleaned up for  urlLink  church .  Saturday night, as always, is church night.  Sunday, bloody Sunday, will be spent with my nose in my  Structured Programming Using C  book.  I have an exam on Monday night.  Programming exams are the worst.  I’d rather have a Pap smear.    Happy Friday, Y’all.

       Blog It Forward   What a neat idea!  Did you know that today is  urlLink Blog It Forward Day ?  Apparently, some guy named Buzz came up with it.  See, what you do is give a shout out to one or two or several of your favorite blogs and then drop a comment on  urlLink Buzz's site .  For example - and you may want to take notes here - one of my very favorite blogs is  urlLink  Poetic Champions Compose .  The gal is a riot and any blog that encourages commenting in haiku is just plain special.  Another daily read of mine is  urlLink  Diva Diversion .  She's a good friend and really one of the sweetest people I know.  Also, she changes blog skins like most of us change our shoes.  A bit of exaggeration there, but only a  bit .  And finally - oh hush, I'm almost done - I'm rather partial to  urlLink Inspired Procrastination .  She runs a petsitting/dogwalking service and is trying to procreate with "the rock star".  Puppies and boinking...can't go wrong with that.  Ok ok...one more then I'm done,  I swear .  Check out  urlLink  Natalieville .  She cracks me up, plus, she's a fellow Houstonian.  What can I say?  I'm biased.  Go on now...Blog it forward!  Daylight's a-wasting!  Peace out.

Give it a whirl...or spin it right 'round like a record baby...and let me know how you do.

       Doce Uvas y Un Caldero de Agua   That’s  Twelve Grapes and a Pot of Water  for my non-Spanish-speaking friends.  New Year’s Eve is almost upon us, and as Cuban-Americans, my family has a couple of traditions that will come to pass each and every New Year’s Eve, come Hell or high water.  For instance, at precisely the stroke of midnight, we must all consume twelve grapes – one for each month of the New Year – making a wish with each grape.  Be careful not to choke.  I have no idea where this tradition comes from, or even if it is limited to just  a Cuban Thing , but for as long as I have been old enough to chew my food, I can remember waiting for the New Year with a cup of grapes in my hand.  And during those few times that I have spent the Eve away from my family, I brought my own grapes to the party…just in case.  Much hugging and kissing ensues after the eating of the lucky grapes, at which point my mother runs to the kitchen, grabs a pot, and carries out our other Cuban tradition:  the throwing of the pot of water out the front door.  Like the eating of the grapes, this is also meant to bring good luck in the New Year.  It is a symbolic washing out, if you will, of the things old, thusly, making room for the new and wonderful blessings of the New Year.  Twelve grapes and a pot of water.  This is our tradition.   Regardless of how you do it, celebrate the New Year.  Don’t sleep through it.  Stay up and hug and kiss your family and friends.  Tell them you love them.  May this New Year bring to you all that the last year did not and then some.  Feliz Año Nuevo

       Half Time   Day six of my twelve day vacation has come and gone.  To tell you the truth, I haven’t really done much.  Thus, I am well on my way to achieving my goal of doing as little as possible during my time off.  As a matter of fact, the biggest excitement of my day is found in the time spent attempting to pill my cat.  Near-death experiences are always good for a thrill.  And really, I’ve found that I can get by just fine with the use of only seven fingers.  Besides my adventures in cat-pilling, I have been spending quite a bit of time with my nieces and nephew – ages 13, 3, and 1, respectively.  Those kids just crack me up.  Their personalities are all so extremely different, that I sometimes wonder how on Earth my sister’s house has not imploded.  The thirteen year old is going through the  ”You’re Ruining My Life!”  phase.  The three year old is going through the  I Can Talk Non-Stop  phase, in conjunction with the  ”No!  I Don’t Want To!”  and  I Will Freak Out and Act Like a Little Temper Tantrum Throwing Mutant for no Apparent Reason  phases.  And the one year old is in the beginning stages of the  Baby Learning to Walk Drunken Stagger  and the  Let’s See What I Can Find to Break  phase.  I love those kids so much it’s ridiculous.  Thank God they aren’t mine.  Let’s see…what else do I have to show for six days off?  Reading.  I have been reading.  Anything and everything I can get my hands on.  Currently, it’s  Body of Evidence  by Patricia Cornwell.  I love to read and am taking advantage of the fact that school is out until January 20th, at which point perusal of my textbooks will be the extent of my literary diet for four and half months.  *blech*  Quality time with my guy is also on the vacation menu.  That’s always nice.  Nothing like a good snuggle on a warm winter evening.  Cat-pilling, kids, books, and the guy.  That about covers it.  Six days gone; six days left…

       HELP!   Would anyone out there have any advice to offer me on getting my cat to take a pill?  I spent quite a bit of my Christmas day at the Emergency Pet Clinic with my cat, Mr. Stinkers.  My poor baby was having trouble peeing and when I noticed some spots of blood in his kitty litter, I took him in.  Turns out he has a bladder infection.  After having to chase him around the clinic and then being bitten, the vet on duty was none too forthcoming with advice for me.  She made it abundantly clear that she wanted me and my little hell-spawn out of her office.    When I inquired of her how I could possibly get him to swallow a pill, her exact words were, " I...don't...know ."  When I inquired of her an alternative to pills, her response was, "A shot.  Daily.  And not here."  I had her administer his fist dose of the antibiotic by injection before we left (much to her dismay) and then took the rest in pill form.    Feel free to comment or email with any help.  Please and thanks!

I’ll give you a moment to wrap your minds around that concept…  It’s what you’ve always wanted for Christmas, isn’t it?  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus…

       Blahgger   My blog has been neglected for almost a week.  Bad blogger!  Bad…bad…bad!  I offer no excuses.  I have been lazy and unmotivated.  And shopping.  I have been shopping.  Oh, yeah, and working.  A lot.  Those sound suspiciously like excuses, don’t they?  After 4pm today, I will be on vacation until January 5th.  Blogging will be sporadic at best.  No excuses there, either.  I will continue to be lazy and unmotivated.  And sleeping.  I will be sleeping.  Oh, yeah, and watching all of the DVDs I will be getting for Christmas.   Perhaps I will get out and snap some pictures for the  urlLink PhotoBlog .  Of course, this would involve shoes, and one of my main goals, while vacationing, is to try to avoid any activity that requires me to wear shoes.  Perhaps I will simply take pictures of all of the DVDs I will be getting for Christmas…or I could just drive around town barefoot…

       Family Circus   On the same day that my one-year-old nephew taught himself to dial 911 - thus causing four police officers to show up at my sister’s house - my three-year-old niece, driven by whatever force of nature causes children to be inquisitive about what, exactly, would fit up their noses, jammed a plastic bead up her left nostril:    Me  (in the middle of helping my 13-year-old niece, Alexis, with homework, over the phone, at 10pm):  …what’s all the racket about?    Her:    Dude…I gotta go.  Emily shoved a bead up her nose and Dad is trying to suck it out with a straw.  I have to help Mom hold her down.    Me:    Whaaaaat…    Her:    *click*    After waiting several minutes to allow for things to settle down, I called my sister to check on Emily:    Me:    Is everything ok?    Her:    No.  She snorted and it went further up.  We’re on our way to the hospital.   That, right there, is all the birth control I need…

       Weekend Rundown Part II:  Her Name Was  Ruffles    I asked her if she had ridges - she didn’t laugh.    I thought clowns were supposed to laugh.  Not  Ruffles …freaking evil clowns. Don’t believe me?  Here’s a pic of her gritting her teeth and strangling a poor, defenseless, chicken:     See?  Pure.  Unadulterated.  Evil.  Much to my dismay, all of the kids at the party were well behaved.  Not one of them shrieked in terror.  Not one of them kicked her.  Not one of them could even muster a little spit-up for me.  Dammit…

       Weekend Rundown – Part One:  The Boat Parade   I think I was home for every bit of fifteen minutes this weekend…  The boat parade was a blast!  Eleven people carousing on a twenty-nine foot boat made for quite an evening.  As the night wore on and the alcohol loosened the inhibitions of some of our fellow carousers, we found ourselves on the verge of being caught in the middle of a really bad  Girls Gone Wild  video (as opposed to a really  really  bad  Girls Gone Wild  video).  Suffice to say that two of the girls were putting on quite a show for passing boaters and onlookers, and that the words, “Don’t flash the judges!” and “Don’t drop your pants!  You’ll fall in!” had occasion to be heard that evening.  Despite the number of people packed on the boat, I can honestly say that I have never been so cold in my life.  Perhaps if I had partaken of the vast amounts of alcohol on hand, I would have warmed up, but a.) I don’t drink, and b.) I didn’t want to have to use the same potty that the two girls-gone-wild strangers were using.    I felt very prepared at the outset - thermal top and bottom:  check; two pair of socks:  check; blue jeans:  check; fleece top:  check; ski jacket: check; mittens:  check; little hand-warmer packet thingies:  check; Santa hat:  check – the parade took us about three hours, and as we made our first pass down the parade line, I was feeling pretty good…then came the turn.  The parade route had us cruise out of South Shore Harbor and on down past the Kemah waterfront, out to the first marker and then turn…into the wind.  Some several hours later, on the drive home with the heater on high, I managed to regain feeling in my toes.  I can’t wait until next year…  Oh yeah!  Check out the  urlLink PhotoBlog  for pics!

       What’s On Tap   Friday!  Wheeeee!  Let’s see, what am I going to do  to  with myself and other people this weekend?  (Stop it…perv)  After work I am going to hit the mall with my mama for a little Christmas shopping.  God bless the  Foley’s Red Apple Sale !  Afterwards, I will be heading down to the docks to get a jump on decorating the boat (shut up, pdawg) for tomorrow night’s boat parade (rain, rain go away…).  Tomorrow I am sleeping in, dammit!   Do not call me before 9:00 am !  Grrrrrrr… My little baby nephew’s first birthday party is tomorrow at noon.  There will be a clown there.  *shudder*  I hate clowns.  They give me the creeps.  I hope one of the kids throws up on him.  I’m going to jet on out of there and head down to the harbor to help out with any last minute boat decorations and just general hanging out, and then it’s parade time!  We’ll be cruising in a Scarab with a chimney and Santa on the bow and a butt-load of lights.  It kicks off at 6:00 pm so if you’re in the South Shore/Kemah Waterfront area, come on down!  If I can manage to stop shivering enough to hold the camera steady, I’ll snap some pics of the boats for the PhotoBlog.  On Sunday morning I will heading to  urlLink church .  This weekend will be a historic one for Lakewood.  We are breaking ground at what will soon be our new place of worship - The Compaq Center.  What it means to the Christian community to have such a visible place of worship on the busiest intersection in the fourth largest city in the nation is beyond words.  I’m excited!  Peace out.

I mean, come on, most games were over in seven innings with Dotel coming on in the 8th and Wagner closing out the 9th.

       Come On, Ride the Train, Hey, Ride It…WooWoo   Just when I was beginning to wonder what, on Earth, I would possibly do with all of this spare time on my hands now that the Fall semester of school has ended, it appears that the overtime train has pulled up to the station.    With a major project taking up most, if not all, of my entire regular 8-hour workday, plus the software enhancement testing that I have to do for another project, and the day-to-day issues that come with a job in IT, it looks like I will be coming in early, staying late, and possibly spending at least one day of my weekends at work for the next couple of months.  Time-and-a-half is a beautiful thing, however, I would much rather be home slacking off.  I will draw the line at working through our upcoming, two-week, Christmas holiday, though.  No way, uh-huh, not gonna do it.  Besides, that period of time is set aside for else-doing such as vegging and reading and picture-taking and blogging and quality time with my guy, and oh yes! – team-blogging with my  urlLink co-conspirator .  All of this OT, while lovely for the checking account (especially during this time of year), also means that I will have little, to no, time for my security side-gig.  Oh well…did I mention that time-and-a-half is beautiful thing?

       Of HotRods and Jim   The Jim Brickman show tonight was pretty nice.  I was surprised that more people didn't show.  Out of 3000 available seats, approximately 950 were sold.  It made for an easy night of work for me.    The AutoRama was fun.  What can I say?  I'm a chick that digs cars.  I posted a few pictures in my PhotoBlog.  Slide your eyeballs to the left, click the  PhotoBlog  link and browse through the AutoRama gallery if you're interested.  If you aren't, do it anyway just to humor me by increasing my hit count on that site.  Peace out...

       Stuck In My Head    Galaxy Glue, Galaxy Glue, life would go to pieces without Galaxy Glue...   Remember that?  From  The Incredible Shrinking Woman  with Lily Tomlin?  I woke up with that little jingle stuck in my head.  What the heck was I dreaming about?!?!  Man, I haven't seen that movie in years!  I first saw it when I was five or six years old.  Remember the gorilla?  And the garbage-disposal scene?  Ha!  Now I want to see it again.  Anyway, I'm rambling and I have no time to ramble as I will be leaving for the Autorama in just a few minutes.  Yeah, I know, I said I was going last weekend, but little did we know that it had been postponed until  this  weekend.  I'm bringing the camera along, so I'll post some pictures in  urlLink my photoblog  later...possibly tomorrow.  Oh yeah!  I almost forgot!  I'm working the  urlLink Jim Brickman  show at the Verizon tonight.  I love Jim Brickman!  Yes, I know, this is a bit of a stray from my steady diet of  Tool ,  Toadies , and  White Stripes , but I'm allowed to indulge in a little romantic-girly-music from time to time, aren't I?  Don't worry, I'll purge my system on the way home from the show with a little  Godsmack  or possibly some  Chevelle .  Happy Saturday, Y'all!  And if you're in Houston:  isn't it just absolutely gorgeous out?  It almost feels like December!

       What a Dweeb   It's Friday night and I am at home studying.  This is date night.  I shouldn't be here.  I should be carousing about the town.  I should be snuggled up with my guy on this chilly evening.  Yet, here I sit, with my nose in my math book.  Finals are on Monday night, you see?  And by chaining myself to my desk tonight, I can spend the day with my guy tomorrow and not feel panicky because I feel that I should be studying.    It still doesn't change the fact that I'm here.  At my desk.  Doing math.  Alone, and unsnuggled.

       Things That Suck Part Deux   I worked security at the Chris Rock show last night.  I was supposed to work the second show tonight, but I had to cancel because I had to work late at my  real  job.  It's just as well, since I was supremely disappointed in the show last night.  I had never seen Chris Rock's stand-up, however, he seemed funny in his movies and interviews.  I realize now that he was faking.  It was only  pretend  funny.  Frankly, I was bored to tears last night.  His ninety minute set consisted of approximately 12, nonconsecutive, minutes of funny, 39 minutes of "white/cracker" jokes (incidentally, isn't he married to a "white" lady?), 22 minutes of political rants (not even jokes, just rants), 11 minutes of (excuse the word here) "pussy" jokes, and, in my estimation, 6 minutes of Oprah name-dropping (he must have said her name at least a dozen times - again, not even within the context of a joke).  And all of this was punctuated by at least 792 occurrences of the  F -word...give or take.  He was getting maybe a smattering of laughs here and there, and people began to trickle out of the theater in the middle of his set.  And the ticket prices?  Holy crap!  The center floor seats were $60 a piece!  I've seen comics come in at less than half that price (e.g. Mitch Hedberg, Dave Attell, and Lewis Black on the  Comedy Central Live  tour) and maintain deafening levels of uproarious laughter throughout their entire sets.  Chris...dude...just be funny.  Nobody gives a rat's ass what you think about our foreign policy, or even freaking Oprah, for chrissakes.  Sheeeesh!

       It Was a Crime Scene!  A Crime Scene, I Tell Ya!   I got back the results of one of my  C Programming  exams tonight.  The abundance of blood on the pages lacked only the yellow police tape to complete the crime scene.  Why do professors (or teachers alike, for that matter) have to grade in red ink?  Couldn’t they use a less obtrusive color, like a nice, soothing, lavender that says,  Yes, this answer is incorrect, and granted, the programming world has no room for a half-wit like yourself, but it’s OK, because people like you and invite you to parties and your slacks are pressed with that perfect crease in the front of each leg.   Instead we get a searing, blood-red scrawl that screams in the voice of the late Sam Kinison,  AAAAAH!  WRONG!  WRONG!  YOU FREAKING MORON!  AAAAAAH!!!   *sigh*  One more week of school…I think I can.  I think I can.  I think I can…

       I'm Tired   I just got home from working the Bud Bowl concert at Minute Maid Park, featuring Staind.  Their opener, Endochine, was a band from Austin.   Take two parts Coldplay, one part Nickelback, water it all down, and there you have Endochine -- shaken, not stirred.  Actually, they really weren't bad.  I liked a few of their songs.  Staind put on an excellent show.  I like Staind, but was never really a huge fan.  After seeing them live tonight, they have been bumped up a peg - still not a huge fan, but perhaps a bit more husky.  I love their lead guitarist.  Man, that guy just thrashes all over the stage.  He is fun to watch.  As enjoyable as both bands were, the highlight of my night came after the show was over, as I was shooing straggling fans toward the nearest exit.  This guy approaches me, looks down at my shirt, then looks at me and says, "What's the five and the little star for?"  My failed attempt to curb the sarcasm in my voice as I stated, "It's for  5-Star " was beyond reproach (5-Star is the name of the security company).  However this did not stop the guy from smiling and making his second ridiculous statement - "Has anyone ever told you that you look like Sandra Bullock?"  WAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Hold on.  Ok.  Whew!  I'll give you guys a minute to wipe away the tears and regain your composure (especially those of you who know me).  It's a wonder that I am sitting here blogging now, what with barely being able to get my head in the door and all.  His name was Dave, by the way.  I know this because he introduced himself to me after insisting again that I look like Sandra Bullock.  For the record - I  do not  look like her at all.  Good ol' Dave must have been wearing his beer goggles tonight.

       Worth It?   So I get to work this morning and waiting in my email in-box is a message from someone who, at one time – or more specifically from 5th grade to 12th grade – was my very best friend in the entire world.  I’m talking joined at the hip, inseparable, practically lived at each other’s houses, here.  Obviously, the words  at one time  and  was  in the previous paragraph indicate that we grew apart.  The last semester of our senior year in high school we hardly spoke to each other, and when we did it was short and mostly left me feeling very hurt.  The day before she would leave for college we got together and she apologized for the way she had treated me and explained her actions.  I spoke my mind.  She spoke hers.  We kissed and made up, so to speak.  After she left for school, I didn’t hear from her for months.  She would come home and never let me know that she was in town.  After the second time that she came home and called every one but me, I basically just wrote her off.  She eventually emailed me and we made plans to get together, but by that time, I had given up on the friendship.  We went to dinner and talked and to say that the mood was distant and even a bit awkward is an understatement.  She emailed me once a couple of years later and I responded but never heard from her again…  Until this morning.  She tells me that she has been thinking quite a bit about getting in touch with me.  That so often things will happen in her life that she wants to share with me.  That she doesn’t know what, exactly she expects, but perhaps we could begin by just emailing each other random stuff, and that eventually, maybe the pieces of our friendship would come together.    Honestly, I don’t know how I feel about this.  Eight years have passed.  Eight years of growing and changing and shaping in both of our lives.  I absolutely have no idea who this girl - who was once like a sister to me - is.  Nor does she know me -  this  girl whose sentences she used to finish - at all anymore.  I know that I don’t feel any anger or animosity toward her or really much of anything.  I know that if I get to thinking about it, sure, I would have to admit that I miss her friendship, but I couldn’t just jump right back into sharing every little detail of my life with her like I once did.  As a matter of fact, I can’t see myself  ever  being that close with her again.  I replied to her email.  I did.  I told her that it was great to hear from her and that we would give her idea a whirl.  I expect nothing to come of this.  I expect that we will email here and there for a little while and then she will drop off of the face of the earth again, only to resurface years later in an attempt to rekindle some tiny fiber of our friendship, and we will continue this cycle well into our nineties.  Dude…this post is way too sober for a Friday.  I am going to stop here.  I’ll drum up some frivolous content later.

       What’s on Tap   - the Thursday edition…  Friends, we, here at The End of the Internet, have one helluva busy weekend in store.    For most of this month, I had been telling myself that I would not get caught up in all of the Super Bowl madness that is sweeping across the city.  Having a side gig in event security affords me the opportunity to participate in many of the events going on downtown, filling the role of a petite, yet menacing security presence.  However, I told myself, and others, that there is  no way  that I would be caught anywhere near downtown until the silly little game was long over.  But as all of the  urlLink  celebrities  began arriving this week, I got to thinking:   Well, just one little concert wouldn’t hurt.  I mean, how often does this happen?  The Super Bowl.  In Houston.   So one thing led to another and here I sit, with a weekend of very little sleep ahead of me.  Tomorrow night I will be overseeing the general well being of the public at the  Staind  (featuring  Endochine ) show at Minute Maid Park.  This should be a goodie.  It is part of the  urlLink  Bud Bowl  festivities.    On Saturday night I will be providing my petite, yet menacing security presence services at The Verizon Wireless Theater for a part of the Super Bowl Concert Series featuring Toby Keith with guest appearances by Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sammy Hagar, Darryl McDaniels (DMC of Run-D.M.C.), Wayman Tisdale and Willie Nelson.  I am so not a country music fan, and frankly, have no idea who Toby Keith is (according to some of my coworkers he is good), but this show should be great fun.  Also, it will be broadcast live on CMT, so check your local listings and look for a petite, yet menacing security presence on your television.  Super Bowl Sunday – my biggest error in judgment for this upcoming weekend.  I will be reporting to Reliant Stadium at *gulp* 6 am to assure the safety of…actually, I have no idea what we will be doing there at 6 am since the game doesn’t start until 5:30 pm.  Nevertheless, out there I will be.  Don’t freak out - I won’t actually get to see any of the game.  I will be outside of the stadium, probably around the Blue Lot directing traffic and hanging out with the tailgaters, as this is my usual post for the Texans games.  I decided that since I am really not a fan of either team, it would be fun to get out there and just be a part of it all.  The Texans fans are a blast so this should be crazy fun.  Not only that, but our entire security team will be receiving nifty Super Bowl XXXVIII commemorative jackets and caps.  Not too shabby.

       Bring Your Rock Star to Work Day   The good thing about all of the media hype surrounding the Super Bowl being in town is that the odds of running into a celebrity have drastically increased.  Aerosmith visited us at work today.  They were filming a tribute video for the Crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia, as this Super Bowl Sunday also happens to be the anniversary of the tragedy.  They were kind enough to spend a few moments (a very few) with us for photo ops.  Now, I understand that there are those of  urlLink  you  who cringe when I say that Steven Tyler is HOT for an old man.  But come on.  He is.  He is a sexy old man, and I have been an Aerosmith fan since I was about twelve or thirteen.  So you can imagine my excitement in getting to see him today.  I did manage to refrain from throwing my underwear at him, but it wasn’t easy.    And then it happened – The blunder that nearly caused the upset of a perfectly good physical attraction.  Steven Tyler stood there (looking hot) and actually said to us, a large group of  Houstonians , that he couldn’t wait to kick the roof off  The Superdome  this weekend.  THE SUPERDOME IS IN NEW ORLEANS YOU NITWIT!  A collective groan followed by sighs of resignation swept through the crowd.  Steven, honey, you are hot and I still love you, but COME ON!  Anyway, here is a picture that was taken at the event this morning…before the big let down:

       Reality TV Confession #...Crap, I’ve Lost Count   As if it were not bad enough that I am currently hooked on five reality television shows and am already counting the days until the season premier of Survivor:  All Stars, now I have allowed myself to be sucked into the lowest of the low in television viewing.  My goodness, I am almost ashamed to admit this one.  Friends, strangers, misdirected web-surfers, I come before you tonight prepared to admit the depths of my poor television habits.  I realize that many of you are not aware that things had gotten this bad with me.  I apologize in advance for the shock of this confession:  I have been watching…  A Spanish soap opera.  It’s called  Pasiòn de Gavilanes  and before you judge me, let me give you three reasons why I watch:  1.	 urlLink  Franco   2.	 urlLink  Oscar   3.	 urlLink  Juan   If this is not enough, here are three reasons for the rest of you:   urlLink  Jimena, Norma, and Sara

       Half a Slack is Better Than No Slack At All   I fully intended to put in a full 8-hour day today, (yeah, I know, Sunday, but my plate is quite full these days) however about 4 hours into it, I succumbed to the sunshine and 75-degree weather.  Wait, I’ll say it again -  seventy-five-degree-weather .  Today could have arguably been the most gorgeous day in recent Houston history.    It took only one phone call from my thirteen-year-old niece to persuade me to leave the office and go outside and play – literally.  I went over to my sister's house and picked up my two nieces for a lunch date and a little shopping.  Afterwards, the entire afternoon was spent playing in the driveway and front lawn with the two girls and my one-year-old nephew.  We ran inside and all changed into shorts due to the unseasonable warmth of the day.  The Ice Cream Man even made an appearance in the neighborhood.  You better believe we chased him down and all sat in the yard with blue lips from Bombsicles and fingers sticky with chocolate fudge.  I think the highlight of my day, though, had to be teaching my three-year-old niece the phrase,  "shake it like a Polaroid picture"  and the dance to go along with it.  I can’t wait to get  that  phone call from my sister!   Man, what a great day I had!  Hope yours was too…

       And Now, a Tune From My Spiritual Ukulele   My pastor spoke something this weekend that struck me.  I am blogging this because it applies to several people that I know – not that they read my blog, but I figured that perhaps some people that I do not know may stumble upon this jolly little blog and get something out of this message.  He said to stop letting  yourself  talk to you and instead, start talking to yourself.  When you wake up in the morning and yourself is telling you that nothing is ever going to get better, and that there will be no good for you this day, get up and boldly declare to yourself that this will be a great day.  Declare God's favor upon your life.  I do this every morning.  The first words that come out of my mouth every single day are spoken while still lying in bed and wiping the sleep from my eyes.  I thank God that I am alive and healthy on this day.  I thank God for the health of my family and loved ones.  I thank God that I have a roof over my head, a job to go to, and a car to get me there.  I declare His favor upon my day before my feet even hit the floor.  Throughout my day, when I encounter even the smallest obstacle, I pause and declare victory in His name.  I don't ask for it.  I declare it.  I expect it.  And you know what?  He has never let me down.  Not even once.  My final words before sleeping every night thank God in advance for the day that is to come.  It is this attitude that causes me to triumph over every challenge.  I firmly believe that your attitude is a magnet that draws a physical manifestation of your feelings.  If you walk around depressed and defeated and never expect any good to come to your life, then you will get just that.  You will attract nothing but negative people and negative situations.  The molehill will become the mountain over and over again.  Me?  I walk around with a smile on my face and happy just to be alive.  I expect to succeed.  I expect wonderful things to come into my life each and every day.  It is this expectancy that causes me to get out of bed each morning looking forward to what is in store for me that day, like a little child waking up on Christmas morning.  It is this attitude that draws so many good things and good people into my life.  I have people that say to me all the time, "you are so lucky."  I am not lucky.  I am blessed and there is a difference.  I have God's favor over my life.  Not because I go to church or because I live free from sin - because, let's face it, I am so not a perfect Christian – it is because I constantly praise the Lord in even the smallest things and declare my day blessed before I even get out of bed.  I live my life knowing that there is nothing that I cannot overcome – physically, mentally, professionally, financially, personally.  I live with such a feeling of peace that sometimes it just brings me to tears.    Don’t misunderstand me, this is not to say that I never feel upset or stressed or that things always go the way that I plan them.  I have my moments.  I am saying that these moments are few, far between and short-lived and that my unfaltering trust in God always sees me through.  I know that if He brings me to it, He will bring me through it.  It is amazing to me how God will pour His favor into even the minor details of my day.  I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I have been getting ready to pull out into heavy traffic and almost immediately, someone will just stop and wave me ahead of them.  It shows in the way that on more than one occasion, a police officer has pulled up beside my speeding car and motioned for me to slow down instead of pulling me over and writing me a ticket.  In the way that I have been told so many times that, "there is just something I like about you."  These are not coincidences.  These are but a tiny example of God's favor in my life.  My pastor likes to say that these things don’t happen because of who we are, but because of  whose  we are.  I love that.  [/ukulele]

       Greetings, from Stinky Stinkerhead!   According to Professor Poopypants’  urlLink Name Change-O-Chart 2000 , my silly name is  Stinky Stinkerhead .  Ironic, isn’t it?   This thing cracked me up enough to cause me to question my assessment in my previous post that I am getting old.  What is your silly name?

       Bubba-Dogg   I skipped the jog yesterday.  I know, but it was for a good cause!  I left work and instead of heading out to the track, I drove forty minutes to my niece’s junior high school to watch the Alvin Mustangs whoop up on the Harby Hawks.  Basketball.  I’m talking about basketball, here.  Final score:  Mustangs: 41; Hawks: 20.  As I sat on those wooden bleachers, inhaling the musky smell of the gym, and sitting on my hands to discourage myself from reaching out and tripping the next group of kids that went racing up and down the stands, I couldn’t help but reflect upon my junior high days.  I came to the conclusion that neither I, nor any of my friends were this obnoxious back then.  Sure, we had our moments of childish indiscretion, but we weren’t  that  bad.  I felt like twisting ears and putting my belt to a few of these kids.  I wanted to shake some of them and scream, "Pull up your pants and straighten your cap!  You’re WHITE and you live in a small hick town in Texas!  You are not a 'Playa', 'G' or any hyphenated phrase ending in 'dogg'!"  And those were just the boys!  I’m not  even  going to get into what some of those little girls were wearing.  And that is exactly what they are,  little girls  – little girls who suddenly have boobs bigger than mine.  I just don’t know what some of these parents are thinking when they let their kid walk out the door these days.  My God, if this isn’t evidence that I am getting old I don’t know what is…

       Put a Smile On Your Face – Company is Coming   As I was getting ready for work this morning, I caught a story on the local news about our dear mayor’s effort to prepare the city to host this year’s Super Bowl.  Now, keep in mind that most of this early morning newscast was viewed backward in the mirror and heard over the roar of the hairdryer.  However, I am almost positive that what I saw and heard was that our mayor has launched what amounts to a citywide be-on-your-best-behavior campaign, including, but not limited to billboards that read:   Put a smile on your face.  Company is coming.   The story went on to say that the mayor requests that we all be extra patient with the increase in traffic due to the throngs of folks that will be heading down to our fair city Super Bowl weekend.  The billboard thing is a bit much, no?    Ok, Mr. White.  We will behave.  But if you remove our public spittoons and forbid us from tying off our horses to the meters on Main Street, I fear that your chances of reelection may be jeopardized.

       Random   What follows are several disconnected tidbits that were too minute to warrant separate posts:   1 :  I cannot seem to get the new Incubus tune,  Megalomaniac  out of my head.  I like the song.  I like Incubus.  And this blog is going on record to state that Brandon Boyd is HOT.    Hey megalomaniac You're no Jesus Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Wash Your hands clean (or Yourself) Maniac Step down Step down …   B :  I watched football all day today, and after watching both games, I think that I have found the nexus of the NFL in the irony that exists between Payton Manning throwing four interceptions that would ultimately result in a Colts loss to the Pats, and Ricky Manning nabbing three interceptions that would ultimately result in a Carolina victory over the Eagles.  Weird…  In any event, I am rooting for Carolina to take it all.   III :  I can’t help but feel a sense of excitement and hometown pride in watching the NFL playoffs this year and seeing all of the signs in the crowd that say things like, "Houston Bound" and "Houston Here We Come" and "Next Stop:  Houston."  It’s silly, I know, but still, it gives me a warm fuzzy.   Cuatro :  I spent several hours at the office this morning.  It is amazing how much I can accomplish in so little time when I am allowed to work without interruption.  It turns out that the top of my desk is actually a light gray.  Huh.  Who would have thought?  It was just me and the county constable on duty this weekend.  No ringing phones.  No knocks upon my door.  I drove home with a feeling of accomplishment that had been largely lacking all week.  I’m actually not dreading going to work in the morning.  The seemingly insurmountable has been surmounted…for the moment.

       What’s on Tap   Last night was date night.  The guy and I went out to this Cajun hole-in-the-wall and wet our appetites with fried alligator, boudain balls, and shrimp.  For the main course he had some kind of stuffed ribeye and I had the Cajun grilled chicken.  Mmmm...Mmmm!  After dinner we hit the local Cinemark for a showing of  Along Came Polly .  It was pretty cute and funny.  I am a Ben Stiller fan to begin with, but as soon as I learned that Hank Azaria was also in this movie, I just had to see it.  Playing a French nudist scuba instructor, Hank did not disappoint.  And really, does he ever?    Oh, by the way, I skipped the jog yesterday.  Okokok…but it was raining!  I swear it was!  I did go this morning, though.  I woke up around 8-ish and, borrowing a page from  urlLink The Procrastinatrix , immediately decided to put off going into the office until tomorrow morning (yeah, I know it’s the weekend, but work is so ridiculously busy lately).  So I rolled out of bed and onto the track for a nice jog in the cool, damp air.  I will be heading to church in about an hour and then out to dinner with the guy and some friends.  Tomorrow, Sunday, I will drag my slackin’ butt out of bed early and head to the office to tackle the mountain of work on my desk that seems to grow rather than diminish no matter how late I work during the week.  I plan to be out of there by noon, seeing as football starts at 2pm tomorrow.    Speaking of football…I have an announcement to make:  Tomorrow afternoon and evening, I will be watching football.  Do not come by unless you are coming over specifically to watch football.  Do not call unless you are calling specifically to discuss football.  Period.  End of story.  Hope everyone’s weekend is going along swimmingly!

       For the Last Time…   There is much talk around the water-cooler and among my friends about the upcoming elections.  Bush.  Dean.  Republican.  Democrat.  Warmonger.  Tree-hugger.  It has been my experience that people have difficulty grasping the concept that I do not label myself with any party seal.  That, coupled with the fact that I am disgusted with politics and politicians, leads me to withhold my views.  No – I do not have to choose a side.  There is no platform that, as a whole, encompasses my beliefs.    Fine.  If I must be barcoded, then label me with:    | |||| || |||| || ||| || | ||| || ||.  What?  Is that not clear?  Go ahead.  Scan it.  It will tell you only that I am a Christian, which speaks nothing of my politics – merely that I do not look left or right for answers, but up.  As November draws nearer, it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid unwelcome importunities to comment on my political affiliation.  I realize that my refusal to be baited into these heated discussions is a source of irritation for some of my friends and coworkers.  Yeah, well…Get over it.  The fact is, that while I enjoy listening to the largely outraged opinions of those around me, I prefer to remain private about my own.  Do not fret over my silence and occasional murmurs of accord – or was that protest? - But sleep well in knowing that you are right and always will be.  Yes, you too.  And you.  And you, as well.   Clear as mud?

       WTF?!?   So I’m sitting here, working my fingers to the bone (as usual) and on my radio I am hearing Melissa Etheridge covering Greenwheel.  WTF?  Is it just me, or is this a bit odd?  I’m not knocking Melissa or anything, ‘cause she rocks (shut up,  urlLink Pdawg ), but usually an artist will wait until a song is good and dead before they cover it, no?  See?  There it is again - that chorus that brought me to tears the first time I heard it because I had just broken up with my boyfriend of three years:   …Longing for home again But home Is a feeling I buried in you  I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe   It’s  Breathe  by Greenwheel.  Sorry, Melissa, your version just doesn’t do it for me.

       Get Healthy Plan Update   Ok…so maybe 3 miles was a little ambitious.  I jogged a full mile, walked a second (briskly) and entertained thoughts of beginning to jog the third when my legs gave out on me last night.  I was encouraged by the fact that, up until that point, I had experienced no soreness.  Good God are my legs killing me today!  I had planned to spend as much of my day as possible hiding out in my office but suddenly, everybody needs me to run up the stairs to  their  offices for this, that, and the other.  It’s murder!  Murder, I tell ya!  And THEN…  No sooner do I decide to start eating better than one of my coworkers comes in this morning and drops a warm, gooey, cheesy, Italian kolache stuffed with pepperoni on my desk.  WELL!  I couldn’t be rude and  not  eat it, could I?    And THEN…  Another of my coworkers came down to my office this morning, and after stating that due to the fact that he always raids my candy dish (which I keep stocked with chocolate candy because I don’t like chocolate candy), drops a GINORMOUS bag of assorted candies that I  do  like on my desk.  I’m talking about all my favorites here –  Bit-O-Honey ,  Slo Pokes ,  Tootsie Rolls , and those little square caramel chewy thingies in the clear wrappers!    Work with me, people!  I guess it’s my fault, really.  I haven’t mentioned to anyone that I am on a fitness kick.  Mostly because I’ll get "the look" followed by "the lecture."  I don’t need to hear about how skinny I am when a.) I know that and b.) Regardless of the fact, I don’t feel healthy.  I’ve been sick more often than not recently and have been sluggish and not sleeping well.  So for lunch I had healthy white rice and veggies from the Chinese place down the road and I’ll ignore my aching legs and hit the track again this evening (rain, rain, go away!).

       And This Time, I Mean It!   Well, I did it.  I got off of my lazy butt and went jogging yesterday evening.  I’ve decided that it is high time that I start making an effort to get into some kind of exercise routine again.  Not because of the new year - because let’s face it, any New Year’s resolution that I have ever made was gone about half-assedly (it’s my blog and I can make up words if I want to) at best and fizzled out by mid-February - but because I have been feeling pretty slovenly lately.  It’s not that I am overweight (I would do well to gain about 5 pounds), I am just so darn out of shape and scrawny and I feel quite unhealthy.    I really do not eat well at all – I say this as I systematically wipe french-fry grease from my fingers before touching my keyboard.  I really ought to save myself the $5 - $10 per day and start bringing a healthy salad or tuna sandwich to work for lunch.  It’s just so darn easy to drive up or down the road in any direction and get lunch.   Chik-fil-A  is my vice.  I justified going there today by telling myself that it  is  chicken after all , and that  has  to be better than a burger or pizza or Mexican food.  Mmm…Mexican food…cheese enchiladas…*drool*   I walked a mile and jogged a mile yesterday.  I know, it’s not much, but hey, it’s a start and this evening I will tack on another mile.  My goal is to be able to take a five-mile jog every evening.  It has been quite a while since I could say that I could jog five miles - not since way back in the summer of…ok, it was never.  It was the summer of never.  There is a park near my house with a winding track that measures exactly one mile.  Somehow I do better on this track than when I try to jog four laps on a standard quarter mile track.  It’s a mental thing, I know, but damn if one lap on a mile-long track doesn’t seem shorter than four laps on a quarter mile.  I will try to post a blurb on my progress (or lack thereof) each day.  I will take this opportunity to post advance notice of the extravagant excuses I will conjure  when  if I miss a day’s jog.

       The Rocket’s Red Glare   It’s only fitting that the town known as the  Space City  and home to the Rockets, Astros, and Comets would come to acquire   The  Rocket  himself.  I cannot even begin to describe my giddiness at first the wooing of Andy Pettitte, and now the romancing of The Rocket.  If I had to paint a picture that captured the mood in Houston right now (for sports fans, anyway), it would be of a lone chill bump.  Although, to hear New Yorkers tell it, we are, as a city, one collective boil on the ass of the Yankees.  Yet another reason for us to celebrate…  Welcome home, Roger.   April won’t come soon enough.

This is the part where I pretend to have remembered that today is Blog It Forward Day, when in reality, I was cruising through  urlLink Natalieville  and upon reading her BIFD post, did a mental head slap and rushed over to my blog to post.  The blogs that I have chosen to forward for your reading pleasure are three new visitors to The End of the Internet.  They all seem like swell folks with impeccable taste (obviously), so go check 'em out:   urlLink The Soap Box :  Her name is Jen and she seems to be sick as much as I am.  Go pour your well-wishes upon her.  Also, she is a cat person, so you know she's good people.   urlLink Logical Sara :  Her name is Sara and it turns out that this gal went to high school with me.  You may be thinking, "Whoa...guilty by association," but I assure you, this is not  always  the case and at any rate, I have not had ample time to corrupt her.   urlLink SpaceMonk :  His name is Mike and he's into jazz and yoga.  That just oozes all that is cool in the world.  What are you still doing here?  Go read!  Shoo!  Dammit, SHOO!

       Monday – It’s No Funday   I realize that I have made more than clear my angst concerning Mondays, however, this Monday is more spectacularly crappy than the usual, moderately crappy Monday.  This Monday happens to be my first day back in the office since December 23rd.  Christmas vacation plus one week of software training downtown equals an insurmountable pile of crap on my desk.  I arrived this morning before the sun came up, shuffled paper around until I located my chair, and then sat and just stared in slack-jawed silence at the mess around me.  Who needs E and voice mail?  By God, there was a Sticky-Note revolution on my desk!  Relying only on keenness of perception, I have concluded that the Purple-Stickies, embittered by the long-standing Blue-Sticky reign over my workspace, gathered in the West and began their onslaught of the Blue-Sticky Empire in the southern recesses of the desk area.  At some point, the Blue-Stickies called upon their allies to the North and East - the Yellow and Pink-Sticky clans, respectively – who, after scaling Mt. Monitor, marched across the northern hemisphere of my desk and flanked the Purple-Sticky army from the East.  Speaking of email – I failed to activate my out-of-office-auto-reply message before I left a few weeks ago.  D’oh!  I knew I forgot something.  Consequently, after shuffling more paper around until I located my keyboard, I discovered that I had 207 emails  urgently  awaiting a response.  Do you know how many times I actually typed out, “Happy New Year to you too!  I realize this comes a bit late, however…” before I finally wised up and used the copy/paste function?  Geez…It’s going to be a long one.

       Searching for Klickitat Street   My thirteen-year-old niece is a smart kid - straight ‘A’ student and an incredible athlete to boot – however, she hates to read.  I am quite sure that she inherited her distaste for books from her mother (my sister), who, when tasked to do a book report in school, would either rent the video, or make sure that she picked a book that I had read.  Recently my niece spent a couple of days with me, and seeing me curl up in bed every night with a book when there was a perfectly good television in front of my bed all but made her gag.  She pointed to a book shelf holding my collection of Stephen King novels and asked if I had actually read all of them.  I told her that I had, and then she made that gagging noise again and asked why I would waste my time reading.  I pointed out several of them and told her what the stories were about - this seemed to get her attention.  Without pressing the issue, I picked out one of the shorter novels,  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon , tossed it in her general direction and told her that she might like that one.  I must admit feeling a certain sense of satisfaction when 3am came and went and the kid was curled up in bed beside me reading the book.  After lunch the next afternoon – and the stunning revelation that she had never been to a bookstore in any of the thirteen years of her life – we headed over to  Barnes & Noble  towing a promise that I would buy her any books of her choosing in return for an oath that she would read them and be prepared to discuss.  And coffee.  I promised the kid coffee.  She’s actually been holding up her end of the bargain.  I’m so proud of her.  I’ll make a dweeb of her yet…  I think the first book I ever read was  Superfudge  by Judy Blume.  Ha!  I was attending JP Dabbs Elementary - we were the  Dabbs Dragons  - and in our library we had this cavern of paper mache called “The Dragons Den”.  On library day we would select our books and crawl into the Dragons Den and lie around on bean bags and read.  My teacher’s name was Ms. Cloud, if you can believe it.  I lived for library day.  I would immerse myself in classics such as  Blubber  (Judy Blume),  How to Eat Fried Worms  (Thomas Rockwell),  The Mouse and the Motorcycle  (Beverly Cleary), and the entire  Ramona Quimby  series (also by Beverly Cleary).  Good God…that was almost 20 years ago!

       Miserable   I am sick - again.  My cat is sick - again.  I am forced away from my pleasant morning drive to work, with the lovely trees and the pretty deer, into the teeth-clenching, tire-screeching, bumper-to-bumper madness that is rush-hour traffic, so that I may attend software training downtown this entire week.   Rush  hour?!?  What rush?  Where?  Who?  Certainly, they are not referring to the herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter that I encountered on the freeways this morning and afternoon.     What a miserable freaking Monday.  Every time I visit my sister’s house I am ill within 24-48 hours.  Those miserable little twerps, with their snotty noses and their spit-spewing coughs…I swear to God, if I could file a formal injunction to have my sister’s house quarantined until all three of those kids are in college, I would.  And then there is the damn cat…I spent Christmas Day at the emergency clinic with Stinky, risked life and limb to force pills down his throat and even changed his diet to encourage a "healthy bladder," only to have to drag the little hell-spawn to a second vet (because the first vet will see neither hide nor hair of us again) tomorrow.  If this bladder infection doesn’t clear up, I am going to have buy him a wig and dark glasses in the hopes of finding a vet in the area who hasn’t gotten the memo – complete with composite sketch - about my "extremely aggressive" cat.  Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to drink a quart of NyQuil and curl up in my bed with my miserable cold and my miserable, slow-pissing cat, until such time that I must, once again, thrust myself into that miserable commute downtown.  *grumble grumble*

       Four couples, a  Chick Flik , and a Party   Really, it was more of a get together - a gathering, even – of about twenty or so people, bringing together food and alcohol, for the purposes of hanging out, watching the Dallas / Carolina game, and general goofing around.  An excellent time was had by all, punctuated by the fact that Dallas lost.  Hee!  I love it when that happens…  This get together was after the other get together - the gathering of the four couples for the purposes of watching a movie.  Four girls, four guys, all coupled up, watching  Mona Lisa Smile , the new Julia Roberts movie.  The general consensus among the guys was that, given the choice, they would have all gladly chosen a swift kick to the scrotum, rather than have to endure a movie with no explosions, nudity, or car chases.  This was, by all accounts, a  chick flik .  It was a movie about girls, starring girls, and featuring girls…fully clothed.  During the previews we were treated to sneak peaks of other, upcoming,  chick fliks .  From a vantage point directly in front of our row of eight, an onlooker would have witnessed the following routine at the conclusion of each preview:   the four of us girls, in unison, turning to each of our guys, with a "I want to see that and you’re going to take me" look, at which point each guy responded with vigorous head-shaking, eye-rolling, and / or head-slapping.  Honestly, I found the movie a little long, but enjoyable nonetheless, and was pleasantly surprised to find Tori Amos in the film, cast in the role of Wedding Singer, in a particular scene.  I do however, call into question this term, " chick flik " that has been so, cavalierly, associated with this movie by so many people (myself included).    What exactly  is  a  chick flik , anyway?  I am a "chick."  And while I did enjoy this movie, I did not enjoy it as much as, say,  The Lord of the Rings ,  Pirates of the Caribbean , or  X-Men , and quite frankly, I am of the opinion that  Kill Bill  was, arguably, the best movie of 2003.  Does this, by virtue of the fact that I sit here, in a perpetual state of chickness, not render these movies  chick fliks  as well?  I’m a chick.  I like these fliks.  Hence, these are now  chick fliks , no?  My point - and I do have one - is that this was a swell Saturday.  Hope yours was too.

       No!  I’m Not Ready!   Yesterday was the final weekday of my two week vacation – a vacation that flew by, in what seemed like, the time span of a long weekend.  I’m not ready to go back to work on Monday, the Worst Monday of Them All – the Monday after a vacation.  Ugh!  Perhaps I simply should not.  Perhaps it would be in my best interest to be suddenly, and inexplicably, stricken with some kind of 24-hour virus.  The good news is that I will not actually be returning to work on Monday.  My annual  Oracle  software training is scheduled for this entire upcoming week.  It is still work-related, yes, but rather than sitting in my office working, I will be sitting on the 15th floor of the Allen Center downtown, munching on free bagels and chocolate chip cookies and learning new software development techniques.   For those of you who know me personally, and thusly, having been afforded knowledge of my email address at work, attempt to hurry along your workday by sending me umpteen million emails (not that I would  ever  spend valuable work time engaging in conversation via email) – you’re on your own this week.   Fear not, my work-slacking friends, for I shall provide for you an alternate means of being ostensibly productive – I give you:   urlLink The 100 Greatest Online Games .  My recommendations:   Fowl Words ,  Table Tennis ,  Gutterball ,  Mini Golf ,  Keepy Uppy , and  Space Out .    Have fun!

       Quizzes!   I just got home from work and I'm AWAKE and I'm bored.  So I'm taking quizzes!  I found this one over  urlLink here :        You're  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn !   by Mark Twain     With an affinity for floating down the river, you see things in black and white. The world is strange and new to you and the more you learn about it, the less it makes sense. You probably speak with an accent and others have a hard time understanding you and an even harder time taking you seriously. Nevertheless, your adventurous spirit is admirable. You really like straw hats.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     Came across this one  urlLink here :    Heart of Crystal    urlLink   What is Your Heart REALLY Made of?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Found these on my own:    You're a Harp!    urlLink   What Type of Alcoholic Beverage Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy places. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    There you have it, friends.  Concrete evidence, in the form of reliable online quizzes, that I am perfect...and really like straw hats.

       Ow…   You know, I have been exercising pretty regularly.  I have been going to the gym three to four times every week, and really making an effort to get into shape.  I even think I found a muscle somewhere on my arm the other day.  However, this condition – that of my having an actual muscle on my body - must be in remission, because I can’t seem to find it anymore.  My point being that I have been feeling pretty darn good about my health and fitness lately.  That is, until this morning.  This morning, my legs, lower back, and even by butt all feel like they are in traction.  Why?  Well, allow me to explain:  Last night I worked security at the Story of the Year / Hoobastank / POD / Linkin Park concert at the Toyota Center.  It was a sold out show and due to the perceived nature of the crowd that would be in attendance, security measures were tightened over and above our general bag-searches and wandings to include full pat-downs of each and every patron entering the facility.  For a solid two-hours, yours truly stood just outside one of the entrances of the Toyota Center rummaging through ladies purses, patting down patrons and confiscating everything from cameras (no cameras allowed at last night’s show) to pepper-spray (no pepper spray allowed ever) to chains (no chains either) to lighters (at the request of Linkin Park).  My pain and suffering today stems partly from being on my feet for several hours, but mostly from the pat-downs, which required me to repeatedly squat and stand as I passed my hands over people from shoulders to ankles.  This squat/stand motion was repeated almost non-stop over the course of two hours and hundreds of people who happened to choose to enter the Toyota Center via the Bell Street entrance.  Damn you all!  As I grew tired, I must have begun to favor my right leg in squatting and standing because the entire right side of my body, from lower back to the right side of my rear end, is KILLING me.  Add to that the hoarseness of my voice from shouting, "NO LIGHTERS; NO CAMERAS; NO CHAINS; HAVE YOUR BAGS OPEN AND POCKETS EMPTY; GUYS THIS WAY; LADIES WALK TOWARD ME," what seemed like eighty-nine thousand times, and I am quite the picture of unhealthy this morning.  And because I was outside nosing through bags and feeling people up, I missed Story of the Year, however I managed to catch the entire Hoobastank performance.  This worked out great, since Hoobastank was my favorite act on the line-up.  They ended their set with a high-pitched rendition of Cindy Lauper’s "Girls Just Want to Have Fun."  Excellent!  POD and Linkin Park also put on good sets, however I didn’t hang around for all of it.  I milled around the concourse and just trotted into the arena to watch each time I heard a song that I liked.  Good show.

       Let It Rain…   I drove home this afternoon in a downpour of the type that slows traffic to a crawl and forces us to lean forward from our normal fair weather, slouchy driving to grip the steering wheel a little tighter.  There was a lot of water on the roads and as I pulled into my driveway, I had already decided to skip the gym tonight.  About an hour later, I noticed that the rain had stopped and my own guilty conscience – which was absent when I was changing into my jammies an hour  earlier  - led me to quickly change my clothes again and head to the gym.  Let me tell you…I am so thankful that that nagging little voice caused me to go outside when I did.  As I rounded the corner toward the park behind my house, I stopped at an intersection and caught sight of something so beautiful that I immediately made a u-turn and went home to snatch up my camera.  Picture this:  An intersection.  A park directly in front of you.  The sun is setting to your right, over the trees in the park.  To your left, the rain-soaked sky is a misty blue, and the setting sun is reflecting the most beautiful rainbow, seemingly out of a single fluffy white cloud.  Having trouble?  Don’t worry.  Remember, I said I ran home for the camera.  Here is half of the story - the  urlLink rainbow  .  And one more shot of it just for good measure.  In  urlLink this one   you can see just a whisper of a second rainbow in the background.  And then there was the  urlLink sunset  .  These pictures really don’t do the scene any justice.  I wish I were a better photographer.  Even so, you just had to be there.  Oh, and I did eventually make it to the gym - in case you were taking notes…

       Ex-Boyfriends Suck Big Donkey Gonads   Particularly my most recent ex – we broke up over a year ago.  Yesterday morning I walked out to my vehicle to find a note tucked under the windshield wiper of my vehicle.  Actually, it was two cards sealed in a plastic baggie because it had been raining.    And a happy Monday to you too…  The first card read, "Thank you for the card.  I love you.  Love, [jerk]," and contained three smaller cards inside, the covers of which were art prints that he knew I would like, the insides of which were blank.  The second card read, "Thank you for the basket.  I think about you constantly.  I love you more, [jerk]."  This isn’t the first time he does this, you know.  Oh yes!  He has left little notes on my vehicle or in my mailbox since our break-up… over a year ago .  He leaves me alone for several months at a time only to resurface in the form of annoying little love notes - paper and ink reminders of his existence.  The last time he did this was last September…I think.  I have never responded.  I always just throw them away.    This one however, has me baffled.  I don’t know what to make of it.  I didn’t send him a card or basket.  As a matter of fact, I never, in the history of our three-year relationship, bought him a basket of anything.  Nor have I contacted him in any shape or form since the day of our break-up… over a year ago .  Perhaps this is a ploy to get a rise out of me.  To get me to respond.  To call him - not gonna happen.  Or perhaps someone (maybe his psycho mother) sent him a basket in my name and he actually thinks that it is from me.  A bit far-fetched, but I just don’t know what to think.  IT’S BEEN OVER A FREAKING YEAR FOR CRAP’S SAKE!  I have been joking about this the last couple of days, mostly to mask my annoyance and the fact that I am more than a just little creeped out.  I feel like my personal "bubble," if you will, has been violated.  There is no stamp or address on these cards – there never is.  This guy, whose welcome expired… over a year ago , physically walked up to my home and deposited these items on my vehicle.  In retrospect I realize that I should not have even opened the cards.  That I should have – and will from now on – shred them, unopened.  I am allowing this person whom I cast out of my life for valid reasons rule my emotions.  It would be easy for me to say that I am annoyed and upset because he caused me to be annoyed and upset, when in fact, I am annoyed and upset because I have allowed him to make me feel this way.  What ticks me off the most is that I recognize this error in myself and yet I continue to let it bother me.  *slap*  Whew!  I needed that!  There.  I’m done with it.  Really.  I am.

       I Am On Hiatus - This Post is a Figment of Your Imagination   Well, I went to see  The Producers  last night.  It was excellent!  Very funny and the production/sets were just very well done.  It was also a very nice evening to get out and walk around downtown.  There are numerous shows coming to town as part of the  urlLink Houston Broadway Series .  I'm really looking forward to seeing many (all?) of them.  This entire week has been a blur of work and suddenly it's Friday afternoon and the weekend is but a half hour away (well, for me anyway).  I have no idea what the guy and I are doing tonight, if anything at all.  This may be a veg out kind of night for me.  I promised my niece – the soon-to-be-fourteen-year-old - that I would take her and her best friend to see  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen  tomorrow afternoon.  I'd really rather gouge my eyes out with a Popsicle stick, but a promise is a promise.  I tell you...the things I endure for that kid.  I suppose I'll pick up the giggle-girls (as I like to call them) early and take them to lunch before the movie.  I may even drag them off to church with me Saturday night if I haven't managed to get them out of my hair by the time evening rolls around.  Sunday is my brother's birthday, or "Ralphmas," as he likes to call it.  He will be turning thirty.  Thirty!  I can’t believe that!  Man, we're getting old, Bro.  Before I go on my merry way, I would like to give a shout out / eat your heart out to my friends to the North:   Local Forecast for Houston, TX:   77°F  Feels Like 78°F   Don’t hate…

       I’m Not Even Inclined to Think Up a Clever Title   I realize that posting here, at the End of the Internet, has been sporadic of late.  I really just haven’t had much to say recently.  I sit here now, searching for even mildly interesting topics of discussion and am coming up goose eggs.  Nada.  Zero.  Oh-fer.  I guess I could comment on my weekend for grins:  It was nice.  And short.  The weather has been beautiful here this week…and uh…crap.  I have nothing else to say regarding the weather.  See?  I am completely lacking motivation and enthusiasm for blogging lately.  I am considering a brief hiatus from the blogging world.  Perhaps some time away will provide an escape from these posting doldrums in which I currently reside.  Of course, the instant that I announce this break I will no doubt be suddenly and inexplicably stricken with unprecedented inspiration.  We’ll see…

       Just In Time For Valentine’s Day   No, I did not write them – they came to me in an email for possibly the fourth or fiftieth time over the last couple of years.  As email-lore goes (I got an email, so it must be true!), what follows are entries to a Washington Post competition asking for a rhyme with the most romantic first line and least romantic second line.  I thought these were cute and funny and the ones that I came up with were too raunchy to post, so I am sharing these.  Feel free to share your own via the comments link below.    Love may be beautiful, love may be bliss But I only slept with you, because I was pissed.  I thought that I could love no other Until, that is, I met your brother.  Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you. But the roses are wilting, the violets are dead, the sugar bowl's empty and so is your head.  Of loving beauty you float with grace If only you could hide your face  Kind, intelligent, loving and hot; This describes everything you are not  I want to feel your sweet embrace But don't take that paper bag off of your face  I love your smile, your face, your eyes- Damn, I'm good at telling lies!  My darling, my lover, my beautiful wife: Marrying you screwed up my life  I see your face when I am dreaming. That's why I always wake up screaming  My love, you take my breath away. But what have you stepped in to smell this way?  My feelings for you no words can tell, Except for maybe "go to hell"  What inspired this amorous rhyme? Two parts vodka, one part lime.

       Is Nothing Sacred Anymore?   From the AP:    Trouble in doll-ville: Barbie and Ken split in valley of the dolls   NEW YORK -- Just like J.Lo and Ben, the romance is over for Barbie and Ken.   After 43 years as one of the world's prettiest pairs, the perfect plastic couple is breaking up. The couple's "business manager," Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel, said that Barbie and Ken "feel it's time to spend some quality time -- apart."  "Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end," said Arons, who quickly added that the duo "will remain friends."   Truth be told, the announcement was prompted by the fact that Mattel is releasing the Cali (as in California) Girl Barbie, arriving in stores now. Ken will still be in the picture -- only now he's "just a friend," Mattel claims.   Whatever. The important news is that to better reflect her single status, Cali Barbie will wear board shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a deeper tan.   This new style already has attracted a new admirer, Blaine the Australian boogie boarder.   Barbie -- the most popular fashion doll in the world, according to toy maker Mattel -- met Ken on the set of a TV commercial in 1961, and they have been inseparable ever since.   Arons hinted Wednesday that the separation may be partially because of Ken's reluctance to get married. All those bridal Barbie dolls in toy chests around the globe are really just examples of Barbie's wishful thinking, she explained.   Another possible factor is Barbie's career. The doll who was "born" Barbie Millicent Roberts in 1959 has been everything from a rock star to a military medic. According to Mattel, every second, three Barbie dolls are sold somewhere in the world.   So where does that leave Ken? Said Arons: "He will head for other waves."     This is an outrage.  I demand a congressional hearing.

       Survivor Office Pool Update   The new season of  Survivor  (all-stars, this time, even) began a few weeks ago, and we all know what that means:  I have once again tossed my hard-earned cash into the office pot in the hopes that my randomly selected player(s) will win the whole shebang, rendering me insignificantly more wealthy.   This season I plucked not one, but two players out of the proverbial hat:  Ethan Zohn, and Rob Mariano (aka Boston Rob) – or the nice guy and the jerk, respectively.  Over the last three seasons, I have managed to go "oh-fer" in this cruel, cruel game.  This season, however, is my season.  I can feel it!  One of these two boys is going to win it all for me.  Goooo Ethan!  Goooo Rob M.!    Ps:  I heard Fake-Wham! and Fake-B-52's at the gym last night!  Hahahahaha!   Your tiiiiiiiiiiiiin roof...rusted   just doesn't convey the same emotion unless Cindy Wilson is yelling it.

       Eat Healthy.  Move Healthy.  Get Healthy.   It occurred to me that I have not held true to my commitment to keep you abreast of my  Get Healthy  progress.  Oops.  It’s been going quite well, actually, thanks for asking.  You will be happy to note that I have managed to stick (for the most part) to my  Eat Healthy  plan, achieving a drastic reduction in the ingestion levels of French fries and pizza.  The  Move Healthy  plan was modified from jogging to joining a gym.  I joined Curves with a  urlLink  friend  and have been going three to four times a week for the last few weeks.  To be honest, I hated it at first – the whole circuit training with old ladies thing – but it has really grown on me.  It took me a couple of days to get used to working out in thirty second spurts, but now it’s all good.  Plus, I find the background music wildly entertaining.  They play fake-everybody-from-the-eighties.  It just cracks me up.  Last night, I heard Fake-Madonna, Fake-GoGos, Fake-Soft Cell, and, if you can believe it, Fake-Eddie Money.  It’s all of the original music, and the people singing sound, at times, to be the genuine article, so you’ll be bopping along to  Holiday  and all of a sudden it hits you:  Hey!  This isn’t Madonna!  I don’t know why I get such a kick out of that, but it has been a steadfast source of amusement during my workouts.

       It’s Been Awhile…   Forgive me Blogger, for I have sinned.  It has been nearly a week since my last confession.    I have been busy and frankly just lacking enthusiasm of late and this post is nothing more than a lame-ass attempt to post something for the sake of posting just to get some of  urlLink you  off of my back.  Let’s see, what’s been interesting and fun this week…Oh!  I know!  I went to a  urlLink  hockey game  on Thursday night.  I love my Aeros.  They whooped up on the Utah Grizzlies for my viewing pleasure.  Oh and dinner at The Spaghetti Warehouse was yu-uh-uh-mmy!  I got my hair cut yesterday.  My hairstylist did what she has managed to never do in the five years that I have been climbing into her chair – she ripped one of my earrings out with her comb.  It was the one way up top in the cartilage.  Yow!  After the haircut I went shopping with my thirteen-year-old niece.  I needed some clothes.  I swear it was like being on an episode of  What Not to Wear  with that kid.  The words, "Oh my God - You are  not  really getting that are you?" followed immediately by exasperated sighs came out of her mouth more than I care to admit.  I finally gave up and just let her pick stuff out for me.  She actually didn’t do too badly.  Most of my day today was spent working.  Quiet day at the office.  Got a lot done.  Not too shabby.      And that, folks, sums up the last four days of my life.  Yeah, I know.  I should have followed my lack of enthusiasm into another postless week…

       Weekend Tidbit # 4:  Fans Are Crazy   What a blast!  I am so glad that I decided to work crowd control at Reliant Stadium on Sunday.  I met so many nice out-of-towners with hysterical accents (well to me, anyway).  I was the recipient of a myriad of hugs – drunken and otherwise - and lots of bounty from fans that were all too eager to have me ride around on a golf cart sporting their team’s colors.  One chowder-head who had pestered me to pose for several pictures with him and his sons and who kept calling me "pretty lady" and "Pam Anderson" (don’t ask, 'cause I have no idea where that came from), rewarded me with a Pats hat and patch for my trouble.   Another Patriots fan that had a bit too much of the sauce walked up to me after the game, hugged me and then refused to let go.  Luckily for him, just as I was getting ready to bop him on the head with my flashlight, two of my security buddies came to my rescue and pulled him off of me.  He said that he "had always wanted to hug a Texan".  Good times…

       Weekend Tidbit # 3:  The Beautiful People…The Beautiful People   Am I the only person that had no idea that MTV casts its audience for live broadcasts?  I walked into the Verizon Wireless Theater, where MTV was filming the Toby Keith concert, on Saturday night and was greeted by over one hundred model-types.  It was like the  American Eagle  itself had swooped into the theater and pooped pretty people.  Little pretty bird droppings in designer clothes and hair gel.  See?  They put these Kens and Barbies right in front of the stage so that when the camera pans to the audience, the world is not scarred by the image of us average Joes and Janes.  And God forbid that Toby Keith would actually look down as he was singing and have to see people with bad hair and greasy foreheads.  *shudder*

       Weekend Tidbit # 2:  David Carr Smells Good   I know this because  urlLink  he  was standing mere millimeters from me.  His crisp white shirt brushed my arm.  I looked up at him.  He looked down at me.  I smiled.  He smiled.  We had eye-contact, people!  We had a  moment .   Eeeeeeeee!!!   I didn’t think it was possible, but the man is actually more gorgeous in person than on television.  Did I mention that he smiled at me?    I think he loves me.  Of course, he may have only smiled at me because he thought I was Sandra Bullock - but hey, I’ll take what I can get.

       Weekend Tidbits   I had such an incredibly good time working Super Bowl stuff this weekend (and basically being a groupie disguised as  Event Staff ) that I cannot even begin to organize everything into cohesive thoughts.  So I’m not gonna.  Instead, I am going to blog random tidbits as they pop into my head.  For instance, on Saturday night I had the surreal experience of witnessing Toby Keith, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Ted Nugent, Sammy Hagar, Chad Smith, and Willie Nelson share a stage.  I was awestruck.    What an incredible performance.

       Guilt-Water   Oh me.    The strangest thing just happened.  I must preface this story by telling you that I recently gave up drinking coffee and sodas and basically anything but water and juice.  It's not for any reason other than the current health kick that I am on.  I have been doing well with it.  Once the caffeine headaches subsided, it has been smooth sailing.  Now, this morning I got to work and for whatever reason I got this wild craving for a Coke.  I mean, strong.  I thought to myself, "Self, you have been good.  You have been exercising and eating salads and sandwiches and soup instead of burgers and pizza and cheese enchiladas (*drool*).  You  deserve  this Coke."  So off I stomped up the stairs to the soda machine, salivating and resolutely un-crinkling my dollar bill.  I slid my dollar into the machine and depressed the Coke button.  I heard the usual clanking and knocking noises associated with a 20 oz bottle falling from somewhere inside the recesses of the machine and on down to the reservoir at the bottom.  Now comes the weird part – as I reached down to snag that bottle of caffeine-injected, syrupy goodness, I heard more clanking.  I straightened and waited.    Would you believe me if I told you that a 20 oz bottle of Dasani water rattled its way down and landed right on top of my Coke?  Well, it certainly did!  Guilt -- it came to me this day in a plastic bottle with a blue label.  Twenty ounces of filtered guilt, purified through reverse osmosis and fortified with minerals for my drinking pleasure.     *mental head-slap*  I silently cursed the soda machine and snatched up both bottles, stomped back downstairs to my dungeon, deposited the bottle of Coke on a coworker's desk and scowled in response to his thanks.  Thus, here I sit, perched bitterly atop that proverbial wagon, sipping my freebie water.  *sigh*  Guilt-water.  It's all the rage.

        I Can Be Such a Girl…   I drink loads of water during the day.  Loads.  Every weekend I buy a case of bottled water to keep next to my desk at work.  It’s heavy and awkward to carry and once I get it out of my vehicle, I have to walk across the parking lot to the door of my building and then either set the case down or balance it on one arm and one knee so that I can fumble the badge hanging around my neck out of its holder and swipe it through the reader on the door so that I can get in.  Not to mention the fact that these darn doors, with their magnetic locks, are ridiculously heavy and the cause of audible, albeit often exaggerated, grunting among we, the employees of this company of choice.  Once inside the building, I have to again, either set the case down or balance it on one arm and one knee so that I can fumble the key, also hanging around my neck, into the lock on my dungeon door.  I have no problem doing this.  I do it all the time.  But today, I just did not feel like going through all of the rigmarole.  Plus, I have a bum ankle.  So, I simply sat at my desk in my dungeon with the windows that face the smoking area and the very parking lot where my vehicle, containing said case of water, happened to be parked.  It was not long at all before the smoking circle became occupied with several of my guy coworkers/buddies/pals/friends-o’-mine.  At which point I grabbed my keys from my purse, headed out to my vehicle and got about two steps across the parking lot with my heavy load before one of the guys stamped out his cigarette, trotted over to me and said, "Hey, lemme get that for ya…" and relieved me of my burden.  Ta-da!  It’s all in the timing, you know.

        Have a Sip of My Pants  and Other Tasty Tidbits From My Weekend   Very soon I will be needing a weekend to sit and do nothing from 4pm on Friday afternoon until 5am on Monday morning.  I'm thinking next weekend may be a good candidate weekend.  I will call it my  Cabbage Weekend  and it will be a splendid display of inactivity.  I was going to call it my  Vegetable Medley Weekend  but such a title seemed just busy enough to belie the gravy boat of inertia in which I plan to be swimming.  This weekend started out with a quiet dinner date for four at  urlLink  Perry’s Grille   on Friday night.  After dinner, our strung quartet headed over to  urlLink   Bojangles Blues Bar   where we bopped our heads to the blues stylings of  urlLink  Dave Nevling and the Blues Kats  .  Those boys can play the blues.  Our table for four was adjacent to the stage and it was not long before we were chatting with the guitarist, Adam, between songs.  He is quite talented, by the way.  It was when we decided to buy our new buddy, Adam, a beer that things went awry for me.  The waitress, for whatever reason, chose to set the beer down in front of me – the only one of the four of us that was not drinking and did not already have multiple "empties" in front of her - and wound up spilling most of the bottle into my lap.  She could not stop apologizing.  Fearful that the girl would burst into tears at any moment, I grabbed both of her hands, which were wildly trying to mop Budweiser off of my legs, and said, "It's Ooookaaaaay," for the hundred-and-thirty-seventh time.  She squeaked out another, "Ohmigod, I’m sooooo so sorry," and then turned and ran off to cry somewhere.  I'm sure of it.  Leave it to me to drink water all night and still go home smelling like a brewery.  Saturday was mayhem.  I spent the day at my niece's softball tournament, then sped home with just enough time to get cleaned up and make it to that night’s church service with a member of the previous evening's quartet.  On our way to church, we received a phone call inviting us to do some  Extreme Bowling  at the local AMF (which occurs from 11pm to 2am on weekends) later that night.  Naturally, after spending an exhausting day out in the sun watching 14-and-under softball, then rushing home to get ready for church, and running out the door with bible in hand and nothing but concession food in my stomach, the idea of bowling until 2am sounded, well, like a darn good one!  And bowl we did.  Six of us.  Until 2am when they switched on the lights and turned off the music and strobes.  Today.  Today was a bit more sedate.  Our first meeting of the  Knittin' Kittens , founded, named and organized by  urlLink  Sara  (way to go, Sara!), gathered for Sunday brunch and some stitching and bitching.  It was fun.  Nice people (something like ten of us, I think), good food, and long pointy objects.  What more could you ask for on a Sunday afternoon?  After the knitting lesson – and, Sara, just so you know, I finally did get it.  I am a stitchin' bitch! -  I had a nice long nap (hence, I am still up) and then sat on the couch and quietly fidgeted with my needles and yarn until everything that Sara and Mindy and John were trying to teach me earlier suddenly worked.  Oh, yeah, and I boo-hooed over  Extreme Makeover:  Home Edition  again (see previous post).  Bring on the cabbage!

       The Wussification of Me   I say again, I am emotionally and physically unable to watch a single episode of  urlLink  Extreme Makeover: Home Edition   without being reduced to a teary, sniffling, blubbering idiot.    *sigh*  I love that show.

       "The Wussification of America"   That's what the guy on the radio this morning called it, and frankly, I have to agree.  The discussion centered on the banning of dodgeball in school districts across the country.  Austin was the first to make the move.    Way to go, wusses.  It's dodgeball for crap's sake.  It's not dodge-the-sharp-pointy-things.  It’s not dodge-the-ball-because-the-fate-of-your-entire-educational-career-hangs-in-the-balance-not-to-mention-the-state-of-your-fragile-prepubescent-psyche.  "Emotionally scarring" is a phrase I heard tossed around by people pushing to have the beloved game yanked from Physical Education curricula.  Are you serious?  Were any of you emotionally scarred by dodgeball?  Honestly, I want to know.  I remember dodgeball in elementary school and junior high.  Back then we called it "battleball," and it was a privilege to be treasured and earned by a week of hard work and good behavior.  It was the one day of the week that, for those of us who were and always will be non-athletic types, the walk to gym class was hurried and the stench of the locker room was as welcomed as the smell of cookies in the oven.  The rest of the week, when we had to suffer through the indignity of actually taking the entire twenty minutes to run the twenty-minute-mile, we always had Battleball Friday to look forward to.  When it took all of our strength to muster that one chin-up and so we had to just dangle there because we still had thirty-seven seconds left on that stupid stopwatch (talk about emotionally scarring!), it was ok, because Friday was coming.   And when we had to endure aerobics to the beat of  Pac Man Fever  blaring through gym speakers, the only thing that got us through was the glimpse of that rack of red rubber balls as the coach pulled jump ropes from the equipment room.  One woman called in to offer that the 'E' in PE stands for  Education  and that dodgeball does not teach kids anything but humiliation at the hands of the more athletic children.  Well, I beg to differ, lady.  When we would huddle together before the game and plot a group effort to take out the stronger kids who threw hardest first, we learned strategy and teamwork.  When, instead of running and hiding behind the fat kids, we would turn and catch that ball, we learned to face our fears.  And by Joe, when we got creamed in the face by that red ball two seconds into the game and sat on the sidelines waiting for the whistle to sound our opportunity to get back in there and nail that kid, we learned resilience.  I can only shake my head at this one, folks.  First the nipple-seen-round-the-world and now this.  Somebody better call a waaaaambulance 'cause there's a country full of crybabies looking for a ride.

       Just Let It Go   I have been struggling lately with a friend of mine over relationships and friendships.  About not allowing people whom have shown themselves to be untrue in their intentions and dishonest in their actions have the power to make or break your day or to rule over your emotions.  I was cleaning out email today and came across what I have included below in italicized text.  I am not sure who wrote this, but I found it to be quite relevant to the issue at hand:   There are people who can walk away from you.  And hear me when I tell you this.  When people can walk away from you, let them walk.   I don't want you to try to talk another person into staying with you, loving you, calling you, caring about you, coming to see you, staying attached to you. I mean hang up the phone.   When people can walk away from you let them walk.  Your destiny is never tied to anybody that left. The bible said that, "they came out from us that it might be made manifest that they were not for us.  For had they been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us. " [1 John 2:19]   People leave you because they are not joined to you.  And if they are not joined to you, you can't make them stay. Let them go.  And it doesn't mean that they are a bad person it just means that their part in the story is over. And you've got to know when people's part in your story is over so that you don't keep trying to raise the dead. You've got to know when it's dead.   You've got to know when it's over. Let me tell you something. I've got the gift of good-bye. It's the tenth spiritual gift, I believe in good-bye. It's not that I'm hateful, it's that I'm faithful, and I know whatever God means for me to have He'll give it to me. And if it takes too much sweat I don't need it.   Stop begging people to stay...LET THEM GO!   If you are holding on to something that doesn't belong to you and was never intended for your life, then you need to...LET IT GO!  If you are holding on to past hurts and pains...LET IT GO!  If someone can't treat you right, love you back, and see your worth…LET IT GO! If someone has angered you...LET IT GO!  If you are holding on to some thoughts of evil and revenge...LET IT GO!   If you are holding on to a job that no longer meets your needs or talents...LET IT GO! If you have a bad attitude...LET IT GO!  If you keep judging others to make yourself feel better...LET IT GO!  If you're stuck in the past and God is trying to take you to a new level in Him...LET IT GO! If you are struggling with the healing of a broken relationship...LET IT GO! If you keep trying to help someone who won't even try to help themselves...LET IT GO!  If you're feeling depressed and stressed ...LET IT GO! If there is a particular situation that you are so used to handling yourself and God is saying, "Take your hands off of it," then you need to...LET IT GO!

       LOL!   A coworker just apologized for looking down my shirt!  Oh me!  Is my face red!  I can’t seem to stop laughing about it!  He is an older gentleman, in his early sixties, and he was standing at my desk discussing his weekend with me.  He left and then came back just a few minutes later and said, "[Zammi], I just need to apologize to you for looking down your shirt a minute ago."  I burst out laughing and could feel my face turning every shade of red imaginable.  Then he says, "Well, we were talking and try as I might to fight it, my eyes just slid down to your chest and then I saw your hand move up to your blouse and I thought, 'Busted!'  I’m really sorry, I guess this ol’ man’s still got a little kick left in him!"  WAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  How else do you react to something like that?!?  I just could not stop laughing and blushing!  I didn’t even notice him do that.  I didn’t even notice myself move to adjust my shirt!  It must have been a subconscious reaction or something.  I mean, I guess my shirt  is  a little low-cut today.    I don’t think I will even be able to look at him today without emptying the contents of my bladder into my pants.  I better just stay in my dungeon this afternoon or cut back on the water…or maybe both.

       Good Times Weekend   It was an on-the-water weekend for me!  Woo!  What fun!  I ditched work early on Friday and cruised around the lake and out into the bay all afternoon and evening with friends.  There are all of these restaurants and bars right on the water with docks, so you can just pull your boat in, tie it up, and head in for food and drink.  Man, we must have been out on the water until about 11 o’clock on Friday night.  The overcast skies cleared up beautifully on Saturday morning.  Oh my goodness!  What a gorgeous day - high of 83 degrees and not a cloud in the sky.  We cruised all over the lake and bay from around noon to 8pm, stopping to hit the Crawfish Festival at the Seabrook Beach Club twice.  Let me tell ya…I can put away some crawfish!  When I finally got to bed on Saturday night, I would close my eyes and still feel like I was on the water.  I was totally fine on the boat, but once I laid down and relaxed, I got a little queasy.  I thought I was going to lose my crawfish and potatoes for a minute there.  Luckily, it seemed to pass pretty quickly and I slept like a rock after that.  On Sunday I vegged out most of the day and then worked The Strokes (featuring The Sounds) concert in the evening.  I didn’t care for The Sounds at all.  They especially ticked me off when they decided to hold an impromtu autograph/photo session at eleven-freaking-PM when we were trying to clear the house.  Bastards.  As for The Strokes, they put on a good show, but I’m not a huge fan of them either.  I like a few of their songs but I’m still not rushing to whip out my  Is This It  CD that I purchased a couple of years ago because I couldn’t seem to get enough of the songs "Last Nite" and "Take It Or Leave It."  I did enjoy those two songs live, though.  And that, my friends, was my  fin de semana.   I hope yours was a swell one too!

       March Madness, Indeed   I let myself get the best of me this week.  I never do that.  And the odd thing is that this week wasn’t really any different than any other week lately.  I am busy at work and have been since December and know that I will continue to be for the next several months, yet I felt myself getting stressed out and down right cranky.  Instead of pausing at the onset and telling myself to cut it out, I indulged the moodiness and plastered a weeklong frown on my face that grew to an out-and-out scowl come yesterday afternoon.  The alarm rang this morning and as I lay there thinking up a myriad of reasons and creative illnesses that could potentially keep me home and in bed, something finally snapped inside and I got a hold of myself.  Myself is a slippery little sucker but I caught her by the hair.  Oh yes, I did.  I smacked her around this morning and showed her who was boss.  Bitch.  I drove to work this morning with Shakira blaring from the speakers (Shakira is my dirty little secret – her Spanish stuff, not her English stuff.  Shhhh…don’t tell anyone) and a smile on my face.  My usual chipper self restored.  I met a couple of friends that I had not seen in a while for lunch a little bit ago.  We had Chinese down at the East Star and talked and laughed and smiled sweet and sour sauce smiles.  It was great to see them.  Work will be cut short today.  I am leaving early to hop on a boat and cruise around the lake with a sweetheart of a guy.  Though the sun seems to be away on business today, we are holding out hope for it to catch an early flight back to town.  And to think, I almost let myself steal another day with her scowl and creased brows.  What a waste.

       I've Got A Theory   Now all I need to do is produce the scientific evidence to support my hypothesis – That long weekends are actually shorter than regular weekends.  They are.  The instant one makes the decision to ditch work on a Friday or Monday, something happens to the temporal and spatial coordinates of the physical reality determining the extended weekend, thusly, resulting in a shrinking of the space-time continuum governing said time period.  That "something" eludes me.  I will continue my research over the course of subsequent "long" weekends.     It could be bunnies…or maybe midgets.  Stand by…

       Thursday For You, Friday For Me   It ain’t Friday, but it’s just as good!  I took the day off from work tomorrow.  Wheeeee!  Oh, come on now.  Don’t hate.  That’s so unattractive.  Besides, it’s not going to be all fun and games - I have to have Stinky at the vet’s office by 8 am.  Ok, so, sure, I will probably go back home and crawl back into bed until they call me and tell me to come pick up my freshly bathed and groomed kitty, but I still have to make that initial effort to get up early on a day that I don’t have to work.  And just getting him to the vet will be an ordeal.  I have to sedate him and then risk life and limb dragging him out from behind the refrigerator, or from under the bed, or from between the washer and dryer.  But you can hate me if you wish.  After all, I will be spending the afternoon enjoying the beautiful weather while you are stuck at your various places of employment.  In other Thursday news…I will be heading over to the  urlLink Verizon Wireless Theater  tonight to work the Rufus Wainwright show.  I must tell you that I am really looking forward to this show.  I picked up a couple of his CDs several months ago when a  urlLink buddy  turned me on to him.  His music has been jangling about it my head in some form or another ever since.  Joan As Police Woman is opening up for him.  I know nothing of her music, but this Joan person seems interesting.  This is going to be a swell night, indeed.

       I Smell Like a Boy   I put on perfume this morning.  I did.  Little dab here, little dab there, as I do every morning that I am not streaking through the house in that frenzy that can only be brought by hitting the "Off" button as opposed to the "Snooze" button.  And really, I would have saved myself the time and dabbing had I known that I would be sitting here now, smelling like a boy.  Or, more specifically, smelling like whatever cologne a male coworker decided to marinate in before coming to work today and hugging me.  The guy must have started the soaking process last night for it to have permeated his clothing and oozed out of every pore of his being to cling to me this way.  I imagine that he went home yesterday and had dinner, maybe watched some TV or read a book like a normal human being is apt to do after a long day at the office.  But here is where I get a little shaky in reconstructing the details of his previous twelve to eighteen hours of activity – did he put on the clothes he is wearing today  before  climbing into his giant bowl of cologne, covering himself with cellophane and settling in for a peaceful night’s slumber next to the milk and the eggs and that jar of mayonnaise that was empty two sandwiches ago, but continues to be scraped?  Or did he go naked, and then just pour the excess marinade over his head  after  getting dressed this morning?  Hmm…We may never know.

       In Brief   Man, I didn’t realize it had been a week since my last post.  I don’t even know where to begin.  I do, however, know that this post will be eighteen pages long if I go into detail, so here’s what I am prepared to do to spare you of my ramblings and keep your forehead from slamming into your keyboard due to the sudden attack of narcolepsy that my posts have been known to cause - I will post about my week from last Wednesday through today allowing myself exactly ten words to sum up each day.  Ready?  Here goes:   Wednesday :  Can’t remember back that far.  Must not have been interesting.   Thursday :  Work.   Survivor  night.  My guys are still in it.  Woo!   Friday :  Yngwie Malmsteen at Verizon theater.  Really, really, really, really sucked.   Saturday :  Shopping.  Church.  Xtreme Bowling 'til 2am.  Had a freaking blast.   Sunday :  Happy Birthday to me!  Boating.   urlLink The Great Caruso .   Cabaret .  Wonderful!   Monday :  Idiot.  Clumsy idiot.  Twisted my ankle at the gym.  Ow.   Tuesday :   Hobbled to work.  Hobbled home.  Fat ankle.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.   Today :  Beautiful day.  Ankle’s less fat.  This was a stupid idea.   Just keep in mind that I did this for  urlLink you .  Admit it - you counted every freaking word didn't you?

       Random   I saw exactly 4.2 seconds of  Forever Eden  the other night before cursing under my breath and physically getting up to turn off the television.  If I forget to use the remote in my haste to rid my living room of horrible programming, something is very, very wrong with a show.  And is it just me, or is this  Paradise Hotel  all over again?  ********** Susan Wright was found guilty today.  Wright has been convicted of tying her husband to their bed with neckties, stabbing him one-hundred-ninety-three times (I spelled it out to remove any doubt of a typo), and burying his body in the backyard all in a scheme to get at her husband’s $200,000 life insurance policy.  She was arrested a week later when the family dog dug up his body.  I found myself glued to this trial not only because the details of this local case are so bizarre, but because I have become a fan of Kelly Siegler, the Assistant DA in the case.  This woman actually hauled the bed where Wright killed her husband into the courtroom – bloody mattress and all – tied another prosecutor to it, then straddled him and feigned stabbing him to death for the jury.  Go Kelly!  The details of the case can be found  urlLink  here , and if you click on the video links on the right, you can watch Kelly the Super DA in action.  **********  urlLink Kingdom Hospital  starts tonight and I must admit that I am pretty psyched.  Not only does this show bring a welcome break from my near exclusive Reality TV diet, but it’s Stephen King, man!  And it has an outstanding cast.  Check it out.  ********** A couple of observations leftover from my jaunts around town this weekend:    You should not wear jeans that are "extreme low rise," with panties that aren’t.    If you require the aid of curb-feelers to successfully navigate your vehicle from point A to point B, GET OFF THE ROAD!

       I Always Say…   As I was out and about this weekend, I drove passed the scene of an accident, or better stated,  attempted  to drive passed the scene of an accident when the line of rubber-neckers in front of me caused me to catch the light at the intersection where the accident had occurred.  The scene was directly to my left.  As I waited for the light to change, I glanced around, looking for the damaged vehicles, seeking an opportunity to apply the Wapnerian Physics I learned during my years of watching litigants move play cars across the whiteboard in  The People’s Court .  No wreckage. No tell-tale shards or broken tail lights. In fact, no sign of cars at all.  Hmm…  What I did find, to my horror, was a body covered in a white sheet, lying in the middle of the road, not ten feet from my vehicle.  Shoes that were on the living, breathing being that had been reduced to a shell of humanity under a sheet on wet pavement, where situated haphazardly in the road.  As if this person had casually kicked his shoes off before lying down to his death.  The light changed.  As I drove away, I was surprised to find that more disturbing to me than the shrouded body itself was the image left in my mind of the shoes in the road.  How strange.  But there was something about seeing those shoes that drew a direct correlation to the way that I open my front door and leave my own shoes strewn in the foyer.  It gave me a shudder that lasted the rest of the way home.  My nosey nature – or, as I like to call it, my inquisitive tendency – led me to inquire of my coworkers as to the details of the weekend’s accident.  I learned today that the shoes in the road, as well as the body, once belonged to a ninety-year-old man who, minutes before my arrival to the scene, had suffered the terrible misfortune of being struck by a Hummer.  How sad - To live to be ninety only to be struck by a Hummer on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  Tragic, even.  Heck, better to be struck by a Hummer in your nineties than to be struck by a Hummer in your thirties.  I  always  say…

       OH FOR THE LOVE OF...Fabio?   I deserve it.  This is what I get for willingly submitting to the lobotomy administered by network television also known as reality TV.  Last night’s finale of  Average Joe  was the most insanely stupid crap I have ever admitted to watching.  Of  course  Larissa broke Brian’s (the average Joe’s) heart.  Of  course  she went scampering off into the sunset with Gil because, though lacking...oh, I don't know...a PERSONALITY, he would look good on her arm.  And the surprise twist?  There are no words in my limited vocabulary for the stupidity of it all.  For a week the network had been touting this "secret" from her past that would shock everyone.  This "secret" that would creep up through our television sets and persuade us to lean forward in anticipation so that it could reach it’s slender hand through our screens and slap our faces, leaving us slack-jawed and wondering what just happened.  Naturally, I was a wreck all week.  What could this be?  This hint of darkness in Larissa’s past?  Ooh!  A kid!  No, no!  A divorce!  A porn video that she made in college featuring the midget from the  Littlest Groom !  No, no!  Balls!  She has balls!  Larissa is a MAN, baby!   Alas.  None of these wonderfully delicious skeletons arose from Larissa’s closet to don a red zippered jacket and do the dance from the  Thriller  video.  What she confessed to Gil was  – and I hope you are sitting down because the sheer ridiculousness of this is sure to bowl you over – that her ex-boyfriend is none other than…  *cue dramatic music*  …Fabio.  Fabio.  Her big "secret" was Fabio.  I’ll give you a moment to wrap your minds around the absurdity of dramatizing a "secret" that involves the  I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter  guy.  This "secret," the very one that caused me to lean forward in anticipation, did not reach out and slap my face!  It touched my nose and then shoved its thumb between its first two fingers and shouted, "GOT YOUR NOSE!"  This blog is stating, for the record, that a concerted effort will be made to reduce the amount of reality television consumption sustained within said blog’s home.  PS:  Upon learning of Larissa’s sordid history with Butter-nuts, Gil packed his bags and left her sobbing and wailing in paradise – "I rejected 25 guys and now  I’m  being rejected!"    *cue Nancy Kerrigan screaming, "Waaaahaaahaaaahy?!"*

       Squeaky Clean   I have showered the funk of the gym from my body.  My hair, neatly tucked behind my ears, is wet and smells of  Herbal Essences …now with Hawafena!  My toes, perched carefully on the casters of my chair, are a freshly painted  Sun Spark Orange .  My legs are newly shaved and smooth thanks to  Venus  and  Skintimate – Raspberry Rain .  My face is clean and soft, cheeks pink from exfoliation, emulsification, and moisturizing.  Eyebrows are tweezed.  Ears are clean.  Fingernails are trimmed and filed.  All of this grooming can mean only one thing – it’s Monday night and there isn’t a dang thing on television until 9 pm when the season finale of  Average Joe  will begin.  *sigh*    Stubbly legs and dry skin - another tragedy in the wake of the evil that is reality television.

       What’s On Tap   It’s finally Friday!  Woo!  Hey, is anyone else having a hard time believing that tomorrow is already May?  Man, this year is just zipping right along…  Anyway, back to the matter at hand – the weekend.  Woo!  Tonight I will be heading down to the Juice Box (that’s Minute Maid Park for you non-locals) to check out my  urlLink Houston Astros  (I love them and they are mine).  Roger Clemens is on the mound for us tonight.  The Rocket!  Can I get a HELLYEAH!  He’s 4-0 and if he snags a win over Ken Griffey Jr. and Cinci tonight, he’ll be the first man in an Astros uniform to ever pull off five wins in April.  GO ‘STROS!  Tomorrow is kind of up in the air, depending on the weather.  Even though there is like a 70% chance of thunderstorms (some possibly strong according to the weather channel) we are attempting to use the power of positive thinking to summon that remaining 30% chance that the skies will hold their water so we can go to the annual  urlLink  Keels & Wheels  classic car / wooden boat show.  Keep your fingers crossed for no rain tomorrow for me.  Sunday is also up in the air (yuk-yuk) as it is time for the annual Wings Over Offats (that’s one of the bayous down here) Air Show.  It’s smaller than the bigger annual air show that takes place at Ellington Field, but it should be cool all the same.  I love air shows…  All three days should provide plenty of photo fodder and I will be bringing my camera along, so keep your eyes peeled for  urlLink  Fotografìa  updates.  Have a good one, y’all!

       Henny Penny   You ever have to work around people who scare easily?  Who get frazzled at the slightest hiccup in their routine?  I’m talking about the kind of people who will swim in an ocean but drown in a glass of water.  They will be going along just fine.  Working and functioning like a normal human being (lemming), and then the tiniest twinge of pressure is applied to a given situation and WHAM-O!  they are molting -- running around squawking and shedding feathers like a chicken with a wild dog in their coup.  Just wondering… IloveMyJobILoveMyJobILoveMyJob

       Word of the Day   (from  urlLink Merriam-Webster Online )   milquetoast    milquetoast  • \MILK-toast\  • noun  : a timid, meek, or unassertive person    Example sentence:   Brian was such a milquetoast that he agreed to work extra hours on Sunday even though he had already told his boss that he needed that day off.    Did you know?   Caspar Milquetoast was a comic strip character created in 1924 by the American cartoonist Harold T. Webster. The strip, called "The Timid Soul," ran every Sunday in the New York Herald Tribune for many years. Webster, who claimed that Milquetoast was a self-portrait, summed up the character as "the man who speaks softly and gets hit with a big stick." The earliest examples we could find "Milquetoast" used as a generic synonym for "timid person" date from the mid-1930s. Caspar's last name might remind you of "milk toast," a bland concoction of buttered toast served in a dish of warm milk.   Ok, so, I’m such a dork that I peek in on the  word of the day  every day.  Yeah, so?  I’m not afraid to admit that.  See?  No milquetoast here.  No sir.  Besides, I like to think of myself as more of a banana bread – sweet and sort of nutty.  Anyway, I thought this was a cool word so I am sharing.  - Zambanana

       Little Girl You’re In the Middle   I arrived to work today to the news that a coworker passed away early this morning.  I didn’t know the man as well as I know some of my other coworkers, but I liked talking to him because I enjoyed his thick east coast accent.  It reminded me of what my family in Florida sounds like and what I must have sounded like before my speech was diluted by so many years of exposure to East Texas drawl.  The atmosphere around the office is always so strange when a coworker passes away.  It seems to turn into this weird amalgam of people who are feeling the pangs of losing a friend, people who didn’t know the person at all, and people in the middle of the two extremes.  The friends gather in small groups and speak in tearful, still tones; the not-knowers speak loudly and carry on about the weather/news/sports, unaffected or simply oblivious to the passing of “that guy that worked over in that department,” leaving those of us in the middle to tip-toe around both groups not knowing exactly how to act, so we offer comfort to the friends in the form of hands on shoulders and still-spoken “I’m-so-sorry”s and then wind up in a cubicle loudly carrying on about how much we hate the Lakers.  The result is this sort of loud hush that I suspect can only be sensed by those of us in the middle.  Those of us for whom the deceased was an acquaintance – not a friend and not a stranger, just a friendly white-haired guy who spoke with an accent that made us smile and reminded us of family.

       Cyn In the Flesh   Let me just preface this by saying that Cyndi Lauper has replaced Rufus Wainwright as the best show I've seen all year.  I worked security last night at her show.  I got there extra early to watch sound check, as I always do when it's someone that I like.  As soon as I walked into the building I heard that unmistakable voice coming from the theater area -- she was talking to the sound guys.  I just love her accent.  So I walked into the theater and grabbed a seat and watched for a bit.  She sounded amazing.  It’s like her voice only gets stronger as she gets older.  I watched her sing pieces of her set and direct the sound guys to put more “balls” into her bass lines here and there, and after a few minutes, I got up and began chalking the floors (we mark the rows of seats with letters to help people find their seats).  I was going up and down every isle chalking every row on the floor section, standing and stooping, stooping and standing as she was warming up.  Then I heard her say, "What does this sound like out there?  I want to hear from down in the audience (awwdience)" and I didn't look up to see where she was going until she was standing directly behind me.    I nearly ran right into her.  I stood up to move to the next row and there she was, right in my face!  She said, "Hi there!" and I said, "Hey there!" and she smiled and I smiled and I stepped out of her way and she clomped off (because she doesn't walk -- she clomps) to the mixer board behind me.  I finished up the floors and went beaming into the security office to tell my cohorts about my "Cyndi moment."  One of my security buddies, who was sitting off somewhere watching the sound check also, said that Cyndi actually had her arms out to grab me so that I didn't back into her and just as she was about to grab me, I stood up.  I think I would have fainted had someone grabbed me from behind and I turned around only to discover that it was Cyndi Lauper.  I know -- how professional, but it was too cool!  And the show was so amazing!  That woman put on such a great performance.  She opened the show with “At Last” and ended it with “Girls Just Want To Have Fun.”  She had just the right mixture of old and new stuff (which wasn’t really “new” stuff per se, since her latest album is a collection of “standards”).  She was dancing all over the stage in the quirky Cyndi Lauper style that is amusingly reminiscent of Elaine Benice from  Seinfeld .  She was workin' it.  She had the whole place on their feet for the entire performance – and not just because the wig on the head of the drag queen in the front row was blocking the entire stage.    What really struck me about her was that she interacted so much with the audience that she just made it special for everyone.  She actually had a red staircase leading down into the first row of seats and she kept clomping down the stairs and running up and down the isles.  She was standing on people's chairs in the middle of the floor section and singing to people.  She was hugging everybody and loving on our security guys.  People were bringing her flowers and necklaces and little gifts, and she wouldn't just take them and walk off, she would take that extra second to smile at the person or shake their hand.  I have so much respect for an artist that isn't too big to actually physically interact with her fans.  Helluva show.  Gosh!  I’m still gushing, aren’t I?  Here’s the set list:  At Last Stay Drove All Night If You Go Away All Through The Night Walk On By Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood She Bop Sisters Of Avalon Change Of Heart True Colors Shine Hard To Be Me Money Changes Everything Time After Time Girls Just Want To Have Fun

       De-Lovely   And speaking of music…  The other night when I went to see my drag queen / show tune movie (incidentally, it was called  urlLink  Connie and Carla ), they showed a preview for a movie that is coming this summer, that I have GOT to see.  It’s called  urlLink De-Lovely   and it is the story of Cole Porter, starring Kevin Klein and Ashley Judd with performances by Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Cole and Robbie Williams.  I was sitting there, watching this preview, one arm poised in midair with a handful of popcorn and the other giving my guy the you’re-taking-me-to-see-this elbow.  I love that era and that music.  And the movie just looks excellent.  Man, I cannot wait to get my hands on this soundtrack!  Oh, and check out the provided linkage.  The film’s website is very well done.  Peace!  Y’all have a good weekend…

       Food Groups   I had my monthly today.  Monthly staff luncheon, that is.  Once a month our entire department (all 12 of us) goes out to lunch to celebrate birthdays.  We descended upon the buffet at Ryan’s Steakhouse like locusts to a cornfield.  We gathered around, elbow-to-elbow, at our table for ten with two extra chairs crammed in, and somehow we got off on the subject of bands and singers with food in their names.  Oh my word, did we laugh and laugh at this silly game.  We spent over an hour eating and discussing this and that and the other and every few minutes someone would shout out,  Fiona APPLE !  or  Blue OYSTER Cult !   MEATLOAF !   KORN !  And the funny thing was that we would be having a serious conversation and then suddenly, the person speaking would just stop mid-sentence and shout,  Smashing PUMPKINS ! and then continue on with what they were saying.  Oh man…I guess you just had to be there.  And the fun hasn’t stopped since we’ve returned to the office.  Oh no...we’re playing this silly game via email now:  LEMONHEADS!  BLIND MELON!  NENAH CHERRY!  Ya gotta love Fridays around this place…

       Feed Me TV   I went out last night with a guy -- actually, THE guy (the management staff here, at The End of the Internet, had a meeting and decided that this guy deserved a promotion) – who decided on a whim to take me to a movie about drag queens and show tunes because he knew I’d get a kick out of the singing.  I am  so  keeping this guy!  When I got home I watched the tape of the Wednesday night TV that I recorded, because God forbid that I would go one night without feeding the reality TV beast that lives in my belly.  I watched the American Idol results show…actually, no, I forwarded through most of the crap and stopped on the actual results which take place during the last 1.4 seconds of the thirty-minute show.  I don’t even know what to say about the travesty of all that is just and fair and talented that continues to occur on this show.  I am still too upset to get into this.  If you don’t watch the show then you neither care nor have any idea of my outrage.  If you do watch, then there is no way that you can convince me that you agree with the results of last night’s show.  I suppose I have no room to complain since I have never actually picked up the phone and voted, and for this, I apologize to you, Jennifer, but rest assured that I will be phoning in my votes for Fantasia and LaToya from here on out.  After dislodging the remote from the wall (I was aiming for the TV, but missed wide-right), I watched The Bachelor.  There is this one chick on that program named Trish -- we’ll be referring to her on this blog as  Skankasaurus Rex  -- that has admitted to sleeping with more men than she can count on both hands and feet combined, having a free-for-all romp with at least two other women, and has all but come right out and uttered the phrase, “I am a gold-digger.”  Not to mention the fact that this Skankasaurus is also a primo bitch that fancies herself smarter, prettier, and -- goshdarnit -- more sophisticated than any of the other girls in the house.  And yet, despite the pleadings of his best friend (a spy in the house posing as a bachelorette), our winsome bachelor continues to provide Skankasaurus Rex with the coveted roses.  Hey, I said he was  winsome , I didn’t say he was very bright…and really not that attractive either.  Ah, well.  An hour well spent...

       An Orgasm On a Stick   With a little cup of maple syrup in which to dip it.  That’s what I had for breakfast today and I swear I needed a cigarette afterward.  I swung by Sonic… America’s Drive Thru  on my way to work this morning.  I’m usually not a breakfasty-type person (although, I have been known to enjoy a late-night diner breakfast), but after inhaling all that second-hand pot last night, I had the munchies.  I ordered a  pancake on a stick  because I’d heard that they were good.  Thank you, truth-teller for telling me the truth.  It looks just like a corndog, but tastes just like heaven…on a stick.  It’s a breakfast sausage, dipped in pancake batter and then deep-fried and served with a side of maple syrup.  It’s on a stick and it’s delicious.  I have lots of favorite things – favorite movies, favorite songs, favorite foods, favorite drinks, favorite people.  What I had not realized until this morning, however, was that, all along, I have been lacking a favorite food-on-a-stick.  I now have a favorite food-on-a-stick and I tell you…I am a complete woman because of it.  And I am telling you now that the vacuous reaches of my soul are empty no more…oh wait…those may have just been the vacuous reaches of my stomach.  And should the vacuous reaches of your stomachs need filling, might I suggest the tasty, aforementioned stick food?  Try it.  You’ll scream its name and thank me later.

       Death By Wagner   So last week, Britain’s RAC Foundation for Motoring  urlLink reported  that  the  most dangerous song to listen to while driving is Wagner’s  Ride of the Valkyries  -- presumably because the loudness is distracting.  Among the list of “safe” music was Norah Jones’  Come Away With Me  -- presumably because the softness is more conducive to a safe driving environment, though they say nothing about motorists dying in car crashes after being lulled to sleep.  OK, so I thought I would take a quick poll to find out what you guys are listening to while driving, and thusly, find out whom we need to avoid on the road.  Here’s what I want to know:  What is in your CD (or cassette) player in your vehicle right now, and 4 other CDs (or cassettes) that are stashed in your car, just waiting to kill us.  And if you’re like me, you have dozens of these WMDs (Weapons of Musical Destruction) either in a CD case or visor holder in your car or truck.  But I just want four (4) random samples.  Mine are as follows:    In dash:	  Lakewood Church -  We Speak to Nations  In stash:  Shakira -  Donde Estan los Ladrones? , Toadies -  Rubberneck ,  Joan Osborne -  Relish , A Perfect Circle -  Thirteenth Step   Humor me people…

       Confessions of a SciFi Dweeb   I must admit that I am excited about the return of  urlLink  Farscape  - albeit, a somewhat abbreviated return in the form of a brief four hour miniseries.  You know what killed this show?  Yeah, I know you don’t care because you probably didn’t watch the show, but I’m going to tell you anyway.  What killed this show, besides the budget-sucking sets, was that you couldn’t just jump into it without having watched from the beginning.  The plot was difficult to keep up with even for those of us who loved the show from the start.  Man, if I missed a single episode I had to read the Journey Logs before the next one or I would be completely lost.  They didn’t have enough (if any) stand-alone episodes to draw new viewers, and there was just no way to tune in and be able to figure out what was going on with whom.  Dang shame.  I liked that show.  And the sad part is, this four hour return will wrap up the plot that was left hanging during the final season and I can’t remember what the heck was going on.  It got so confusing towards the end.  But Ben Browder is hot and so I will watch and attempt to piece together what I remember and then be distracted by Ben’s leather-clad legs and then give up and just ogle him.  Did anybody else watch Farscape, or have I planted the flag in  Dweebville :  Population – 1?

       Kill Bill Vol. 2   I’ve heard that many folks have not liked this film.  I, however, really enjoyed it.  It was what I wanted – an end to the story.  If fans of Vol. 1 were hoping to see more blood and violence on the same scale, I can understand the disappointment.  Vol. 2 is prone to long scenes of dialogue and character interaction minus all of the blood-letting that was so rampant in the first film.  But if one takes into account the fact that these were filmed and intended for release as one epic picture, the transition from decapitation and dismemberment to extended discourse and moderate mutilation is a smooth flow.   Kill Bill Vol. 2  is not a sequel to the preceding film – it is the last two hours and fourteen minutes of a movie that was chopped in half.  And so, given Quentin Tarantino's history of non-linear scene sequencing, it makes sense that the second half would be more exposition than exhibition.  Well, it does to me, anyway.  Don’t get me wrong – there is action and there is death, but the focus here is on the relationships between the characters, rather than the relationship between Uma Thurman’s sword and the bloody wake of death it leaves behind.  And I have to tell you that if the only action sequence in the entire film was the battle between Uma’s character (we do find out her name, but I won’t ruin it for you) and that of Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, the movie would still be worth watching just for that scene alone.  Oh, and Gordon Liu as Master Pei Mei is a hysterical homage to those Saturday morning kung fu movies that I used to enjoy as a kid.  Two thumbs up, friends.  Fo’ sho’.

       She Said / She Said   She said:  “You’re CUUUUUTE!  How old are you?”  And I could feel the fire creeping into my cheeks.  Then  she  said:  “Hey…do you have a boyfriend?”  When I pointed at a random man, she countered my gesticulation with, “That’s ok, honey, I had a fake boyfriend once too.”  And then  she   said  SHOUTED:  “Hey babe-at-the-door!  What’s YOUR name?!?”  My head was shaking, blushing, and laughing all at the same time for much of last night.  It’s my red-faced-giggle-shake and it goes a little something like this…  In all honestly, for all of the red-faced-giggle-shaking that I did, the crowd at the  Indigo Girls  show last night was a lot of fun.  Sleep well, Houston, the lesbian community was well represented.  Everyone was well behaved and no one staggered out under the influence of too much alcohol or under the influence of we, the security staff.  Thanks for an easy night, ladies!  Oh, and you too, handful of gentleman.  This was my first IG show, and though I have never been a huge fan, I must admit that what these two gals are able to do with just their voices and a pair of guitars is amazing.  My favorite songs of the night were “Closer to Fine” and “Least Complicated.”   Thanks, y’all!    Cordero  opened up the show with 45 minutes of Latin-infused alt rock that had my head bobbing and feet heading straight over to the merch booth to pick up two of their CDs – “Lamb Lost in the City” and “Somos Cordero.”  The band autographed my CDs.  Excellent!  And to the girl that informed me that I would get her to date a man before I would get her to throw away beer – I am still giggling over that one!

       Kill Bill – How Do I Love Thee?   I picked up  Kill Bill Vol. 1  on DVD last night.  Yes, as a matter of fact, I do realize that this was the very same day that it was released.  And yes, I was aware of this release date months in advance and have indeed been poised, ready to spring like a…a…like a  Deadly Viper Assassination Squad  at the opportunity to own this piece of cinematic genius.  I love this movie.  It was my favorite movie of 2003 ( Kill Bill Vol. 2  will undoubtedly be my favorite movie of 2004).   It’s smart, fast, fun, and if I could physically  love  this movie – in  that  way – I would.  This movie is sponge-worthy.  Am I a horrible person for finding intense satisfaction in a movie so bloody?  So violent?  For wholeheartedly delighting in the Pussy Wagon and the Crazy 88s and the samurai swords slicing and the kung fu fighting?  For laughing out loud at heads flying from bodies and stumps spurting blood from hollows where appendages used to be corked?  I like to think not…  But wait!  There’s more!  It’s not just the creative, almost artistic, presentation of violence that draws me to this film.  It’s the way that, in classic Tarantino fashion, it starts in the middle and ends at the beginning.  It’s the use of color and stop-motion.  It’s the way the vengeful main character’s name is inexplicably withheld from us by a long “booooooop” sound every time her name is uttered.  It’s the brilliant use of anime that knows that there could have been no other way to effectively express that scene.     I even forgive the DVD version for its lack-luster packaging and much-left-to-be-desired insert and extras.  I suppose the Vol. 1 and 2 box set, presumably available around stocking-stuffer time, will offer the full-blown goods.  And yes…I am already eagerly anticipating owning the DVD of a film that I have not yet seen – but you better believe I will be seeing it and  loving  it this weekend.

       Dude…That is So None of Your Business   So here’s the thing…  The other day, a coworker called me up and asked if I would be interested in meeting a friend of his.  I said, "thanks, but no thanks."  It’s not that I wasn’t flattered that he would think of me, but I just don’t do blind dates.  Ever.  I have faith that I will eventually run into the person that I am supposed to be with and when I do I will know it and we will go skipping off into our happily-ever-after.  Not only that, but I would never date a friend of a coworker.  That’s almost as bad as dating a coworker.  I never want my personal life to so carelessly commingle with my professional life… again .  So now when I run into this coworker, I get the feeling that he is slightly upset with me.  As if, in rejecting his friend, I have somehow also rejected him.  Or that maybe I think I’m too good for his friend or something.  You see?  This little "drama" is typical of the minor annoyances that occur daily around my work place.  This is why I rarely leave my dungeon…excuse me… pit of despair …anymore unless I have to go deal with some work-related issue.  People around here feel too free to tread right over that personal boundary and intrude upon private lives.   Zam, was that your boyfriend I saw you with at lunch today? Hey, Zam, what are you?  About a size 4? Hey, girl, what’s your salary like these days? Hey, Zam, I saw you leaving the restroom.  Number 1 or number 2?   Ok…so maybe that last one was a bit exaggerated, but I would never dream of asking a coworker, someone whom I’ve known only casually, some of the crap that I hear around here.  And I’m not talking about the few people here that I consider to be friends.  I am commenting on the other 98% of the workforce that are practically strangers to me.  Who are you people and what on Earth would make you feel that it is perfectly acceptable to inquire about my "status", or the last time I’ve been to the gynecologist?  Freaks...

       You Know, This Ghost Town Ain’t No Fun…   I was running late this morning.  I came flying out of my house and tearing down the street and onto the feeder road of the tollway.  I was a flash of steel and rubber. A streak of gray and black.  One would think that getting my very-first-ever speeding ticket last Sunday would have cured my leadfootitis, but one would be wrong.  I was late, dammit!  In my haste, I failed to notice that I was driving the ONLY vehicle on the road until I was forced to stop at the red light in front of the Stop ‘N’ Go where I often pull in to get my coffee on days when I am not running late.  Days when I am decidedly grouchy enough to warrant a jumbo French vanilla cappuccino or am in need of a pack of gum or one of those Snapple meal replacement vitamin drinks because I have a meeting first thing in the morning and no time for breakfast.  There was only one vehicle in the parking lot to the side of the pumps.  It was a glossy-red Ford Ranger Sport truck with fat tires and shiny rims belonging to the lady behind the counter.  Her name is Myra and she has a mullet and she always shouts, "Hey girl!  How’s it goin'?," when I come into the store no matter how busy she is.  The light changed and suddenly I didn’t care that I was late.  Suddenly I was bitter that I was driving to work at all today.  Suddenly I was bitter that Myra was already at work today.  Suddenly I decided that I would get to work whenever I got there and would take my time about doing so.  I put on my Eastmountainsouth CD (because even my favorite radio morning show is on vacation today) and relaxed.  I drove through my ghost town on roads absent of school buses and other motorists, save the occasional bitter-knuckled fool like myself, regretfully opposing the gravitational pull of their beds and heading in to the office.  I got to work five minutes early.  Determined to be late, because, well, dammit, it’s the principle of the thing -- what thing, I have yet to determine, but I am at work and, chances are, you are not and that is principle enough – I pulled out of the office parking lot again and headed down to Einstein’s and bought breakfast for my dungeon-mates.  I got to work seven minutes late and smiling.  Thanks for having to work today too, Myra.  I wish I could have bought you a bagel and schmeer.

       What’s Your Price?   The morning show I was listening to on the radio this morning was playing this game -  What’s Your Price?  - in which they throw out several scenarios and poll the listeners on an acceptable sum of money to subject themselves to each.  I thought it would be fun to incorporate that game here, at the End of the Internet.  And don’t cop out by saying there is no amount of money, because, come on folks, really, we all have a price…  So here goes.  How much money would you have to be paid to:  1.     Lose a pinky finger? 2.     Lose the hearing in one ear? 3.     Watch your parents get it on? 4.     Live the rest of your life without any hair (brows, lashes, all of it)? 5.     Eat the same meal, for every meal, for the rest of your life? 6.     Never watch television or see a movie again. 7.     Never read a book or any form of printed media (ie: magazines, newspapers) again.    My answers:  1.     I could do without my left pinky finger for a cool $1,000,000.  2.     $4,000,000…hey, I have another!  3.     I lack the amount of necessary disk space to append the appropriate amount of zeros to any number…crap...I said no cop-outs.  Ok…umm…$10,000,000,000.  That would be enough to fund the Zam Memory Extraction Research Institute of America.   4.     $1.75 million – I could buy lots of cool hats and wigs and eyebrow paint with that, and besides, I’d never have to shave or wax again.  5.     $3 million (And just FYI: I would eat baked red fish, arroz con frijoles negros, yucca, and lemon poppy seed cake).   6.     TV would not be a big deal and I love movies but could live without them for $594,832…and 99 cents.  7.      Oh happy dagger, this is thy sheath.  There rust and let me die !  This one would KILL me, but $5,000,000 would buy me a lot of books on tape.   Looking back over my answers, I can say with some certainty that were the cash actually dangled in front of me, my prices would be significantly reduced (what a ‘ho!) but these are my prices here in Southeast Hypothetical County.  Humor me, people…what’s your price?

       78   It’s almost a 'B' and I’m sure it was a good year, but alas, 78 is too fast for the 610 Loop.  Friends, I got my very-first-ever-in-the-history-of-my-driving-existence ticket yesterday.  I totally blame it on the fact that I was on my way home from, like, three hours of knitting with the knitting gang.  All of that sitting still and the slow process of knitting had a direct effect on the weight of my foot on the gas pedal and my sudden need for speed.  Not to mention the fact that we all sat around discussing the worst thing that had happened to us all week and I said that finding out that  urlLink Sara  doesn’t have to be at work until 10am was the worst thing that had happened to me all week.  Well, there you go Sara!  I retract my previous answer and insert  getting my very-first-ever-in-the-history-of-my-driving-existence ticket .  *Sigh*  I was a traffic stop virgin, a rare breed of motorist with an unblemished record.  However, my white dress was soiled by HPD on the eastbound lanes of the 610 Loop yesterday.  Thank you Officer Starks.  Was it good for you too?  Alright alright alright…I have no right to complain.  I was speeding.  I was.  I have a lead foot.  I admit this freely.  And though I wasn’t actually passing anybody, I was, in fact, exceeding the posted speed limit.  There were people whipping around me because, evidently, 78mph was not fast enough for them, but I was indeed throwing caution to the wind and violating traffic law.  I was surrounded by other cars moving equally as fast and/or in excess of my speed, but I was, after all, guilty of  going with the flow , if you will.  It was just luck of the draw.  He was going to get one of us and I happened to be the one he pulled out of the pack.  And in all honesty, he was nice about it.   Officer :  "Ma’am, is there any reason why you were speeding?"  Me :  " Umm…because I didn’t see you there.   No, Sir.  I’m an idiot."  Officer :  (chuckles)  Me :  "You know…this is going to be my very first ticket ever."  Officer :  "Really?  Then I won’t site you for your right tail light being out.  Get that fixed."  Me :  (mental head slap)  "Thanks!"  Officer :  "Do you know how fast you were going, Ma’am?"  Me :  "Probably about 75…"  Officer :  "Actually I clocked you at 78."  Me :  " Really?  'Cause I clocked me at about eighty-five .  Oh."  Officer :  "Do you know what the speed limit is on this stretch?"  Me: :  " No Officer, I was driving so fast that all of the signs were just a blur of black and white .  65?"  Officer :  "Actually, no, it’s 60."  Me :  "Ouch…"  Officer :  "Tell you what…I’m only going to write you up for 70 in a 60 but slow it down and get that tail light fixed."  Me :  "Thank you!  Hey, you have a wonderful day!"  *sigh*    So now I have my very-first-ever-in-the-history-of-my-driving-existence Defensive Driving course in my near future so that I can get my very-first-ever-in-the-history-of-my-driving-existence ticket dismissed.  I figure I’ll just rent the videos or  urlLink  take it online .  Grrr…

       My New Favorite Show    urlLink  Wonder Falls .  Line from last night's episode that caused me to snort in laughter:    Beth (after matter-of-factly confessing to girlfriend Karin that she isn't really gay):  "…is this going to be an issue?" Karin:  "An issue?!?  It's a subscription!"  I am so stealing that little office supply for personal use.  Dude, I love this show.  Who's with me?

       Bitter   The problem is that I wanted this weekend too badly.  I longed for this weekend.  I craved for these days of bliss that I would spend frolicking on the water with my guy and among friends.  During a few frustrating moments at work, I clung to the image of a long holiday weekend that loomed in the not-too-distance.  When I awoke early on Saturday morning feeling downright  ill , I didn’t have the presence of mind, amidst all of the vomiting and churning of my stomach, to feel the bitter disappointment that would hit me the next day.  I slept.  All day.  The frolicking on the water went on without me, as I was not able to stir from my bed, other than those unspeakable trips to the bathroom, until late Saturday evening, when I managed to hold down a bit of dry toast and a glass of Gatorade.  And then I was wide awake -- exhausted, yet unable to sleep.  I slept away the morning today, Sunday, and by midday was happy to be feeling almost back to normal despite my horror, when stepping on the bathroom scale revealed that I had lost almost five pounds over the course of the previous day’s violent expulsion of fluids.  But by midday, any hopes of my joining day two of the merriment on the water were already dashed.  I was feeling better, but not yet well enough to be bounced around or drug behind a boat on an inner tube.  And besides, no one really wants to be around the chick that is getting over the stomach bug from hell.  Hey, I wouldn’t either.  So I hung around the house.  I flipped on the ballgame only to find that it was not being televised (you bastards), and reluctantly sat through a countdown of  100 One Hit Wonders  on VH1 ( Macarena  was number one…go figure), followed by a broadcast of  Footloose , also on VH1; the latter coming about mostly because I was lying on the couch and the remote was  all the way  over on the coffee table.  So this is how I have, thus far, spent this weekend for which I have been so longing:  ill, miserable, bored, and disappointed.  If I continue to think about it, I will no doubt become quite cranky, so I will continue only long enough to tell you that despite the evident moodiness of my tone here, it hasn’t been a  complete  loss – I got restless this evening and went to the bookstore for a couple of hours.  On the recommendation of  urlLink a friend , I picked up John Irving’s  A Prayer for Owen Meany  and Gregory Maguire’s  Wicked:  The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West .  I also snagged a copy of  Candide  by Voltaire because I’d read this in high school and have always wanted to read it again.  Oh, and I picked up a CD too:   Land of Milk and Honey  from Eliza Gilkyson.  And there is always tomorrow.  The beauty of a long weekend lies in that, even when Saturday and Sunday reach levels of frustration previously uncharted in the history of all weekends, there is still one…more…day.    Go 'Stros.

       How Rude of Me   You know, I often post about my weekend or my plans for the weekend, and as far as I can remember, I have never bothered to inquire of you, my faithful handful of readers, as to your weekend plans.  How rude of me.  So I ask y’all:  What’s up for the weekend?  Or, if you are reading this entry post-holiday-weekend, how was it?  Tell me.  I am interested.  Go 'Stros.

       Today Is  Thursday , Dammit…   Today just  felt  like a Friday.  I was off by an entire calendar day.  I hate that!  I spent the better part of the day reminding myself that tomorrow is not, in fact, Saturday, and that I will indeed be chained to my desk for one more day before the long weekend.  My body kept slumping lower in my office chair – this is correct posture on Friday afternoons in the workplace, you see – and then bolting upright when some tiny neural synapse reminded the rest of my body that it was  Thursday .  Dammit.  My fingers kept rolling my mouse’s track ball over to the games folder and then a tiny little voice would whisper, “Ah ah ah.  Today is  Thursday …”  Well, it sure felt like a Friday, dammit.  Oh, and hey!  I finally got around to posting  urlLink my pictures  of the Art Cars from earlier this month.  Yeah, I know, that was several weeks ago, but it sure felt like a Friday, dammit!  Go ‘Stros.

       Rule of Three   Three is that most enigmatic of numbers that will render truth from coincidence; fact from happenstance.   Even in science and mathematics, three occurrences is proof or theorem.  Three strikes, you’re out.  Third time’s the charm.  “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!”  "…I have said it twice: That alone should encourage the crew. …I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true."  --  Lewis Carroll (from something I read a long time ago and cannot remember the name, only that it was Lewis Carroll…I think)   Dorothy had to click her heels three times to get back to Kansas, and I always knock three times on wood (not on the ceiling…).  My point is this:  On Friday night, while attending a small party at a friend’s house, I had an instance of three.  As we stood in her kitchen looking at pictures from the last little get together, a woman, leaning over my shoulder and peering at a photograph of me, my guy and said friend, spoke up:  “Hey…you look like Sandra Bullock.  Has anyone ever told you that?”  I nearly spewed a mouthful of soda all over the pictures.  This is the one, two, third time in recent months that a complete stranger has said these words to me.  And though I disagree and guffaw at the comparison (on this most recent occasion, I actually snorted), really, who am I to argue with a person making claims that I bear resemblance to a hot Hollywood star?  Besides, you know those blind mice?  Yeah, there were three of ‘em.  Go ‘Stros

       I Can’t Believe This…   I have just been made aware that there are  urlLink people  in this country who have never experienced the taste of, nor ever even heard of a  urlLink kolache .  What kind of world is this?  Where people can walk around their entire lives oblivious to the warm gooey treasures baked into a golden flaky roll?  That’s what's wrong with the world you know:  all of these people walking around grumpy and frowning and killing and bombing each other.  See?  All of the world’s problems could be settled by a platter of warm kolaches and a tall glass of milk or even a piping hot cup of coffee.  It is physically impossible to be angry about anything with a kolache in hand.  It is my wish that this post should start a kolache awareness movement that will sweep every corner of the kolacheless world…beginning with a tiny town in Pennsylvania.  The End of the Internet:  Making the world a better place, one kolache at a time…

       An Apple  Martin ?   Gwyneth!  Chris!  What were you guys thinking?   Apple  for crap’s sake?!?  That child is condemned to live a life of ridicule!  One day your daughter could slip while playing on her favorite climbing tree and the headlines would read:  “Apple Doesn’t Fall Far From the Tree”.  Or when she’s a teenager:  “Apple Blossoms,” the papers would cry!  Such things must be taken into account before saddling a child with the name of a fruit.  And you can certainly count on a photo of your crying child gracing the cover of the  Enquirer  or some such toilet-publication, with a heading proclaiming her to be a “Sour Apple.”  You can put money on that one, Gwyn.  And God forbid that she marry a man named Adam, for she would henceforth be known as “Adam’s Apple.”  And the wedding kiss?  An “Apple pucker,” of course!  And if she were to get seasick on her honeymoon cruise?  She would be a “green Apple” for crying out loud!  Oh!  And let us all just pray that young Apple stays away from fashion design.  Her first pair of pumps would render her “Apple cobbler” for the rest of her life.  Well, I think I’ve beaten this joke to death.  I’m sure y’all are as tired of hearing about this story as you all were with the whole wardrobe malfunction bit earlier this year.  Of course, comparing a new baby girl to Janet Jackson’s boob is as, well, apples to oranges.  *wink*  Go ‘Stros

       Weekend de Zam   Karaoke night at the pizza parlor:  we chewed our slices of pepperoni and managed to swallow only what did not fall back out of our gaping mouths.  We were being serenaded by a rather largish woman sporting a t-shirt with a confederate flag and the words “The Republic of the South” on the front, and shorts long enough to just barely peek out from under her t-shirt.  She was singing Bon Jovi’s, “Wanted Dead or Alive” and in that moment, when the deafness of her tone was so baldly displayed for all the dining room to cringe, she was indeed a cowboy on that steel horse.  Ride on, Maggie.  Ride on.  But don’t take my humble opinion as gospel.  Let’s ask the experts:  Randy, what did you think of that performance?  “Yo, yo, yo, dawg!  Sssssssss…aaaaaaaaaaaah…I don’t know, dawg.  You know what, it just wasn’t there for me, dude.  It was pitchy in spots, yo.  I mean, you know, I just wasn’t feelin’ you on this one, dawg.  Sssssss….”  Paula?  “Oh, don’t listen to him.  You’re beautiful and your personality just shines like the oil in your hair.  I loved that song on you, I love your outfit and America loves you.”  Simon?  “THAT was terrible.  I mean just awful.   I can go to any pizza parlor in America and see that exact performance.  You and singing go together like chocolate and an onion.  Absolutely abysmal.”    Redneck karaoke was but a small, albeit memorable, dollop of my weekend:  there was also a birthday party for a guy named “Mophead”; bowling; work, which, incidentally, interfered with my knitting plans – sorry, Sara; and much ripping of the CDs and loading of the MP3 player (the track count sits at 1071 this morning.  Woo!).  Go ‘Stros…

       I’ve Been Slackin’   OK, it’s been a week since I’ve posted, so I suppose I should get caught up before some of  urlLink you  start whining.  Then again, some of  urlLink you  also haven’t posted in a week and so now I am the one who is whining.  Post something, dammit!   Let’s see, what have I done since last Friday?  Hmm…I guess I should just start with last Saturday, the day before Mother’s Day and only several hours before prom night for several local high schools.  So for whatever reason I picked THAT day to go to the mall.  Stupid, stupid me.  It was worse than Christmas.  And then I went to church and did some Extreme Bowling that night.  Mother’s Day found me in the office for a few hours in the morning and then doing the family thing.  We ate crabs; we watched the baseball game; we hung out and doted on Mama.  It was nice.  Monday was nothing special, but on Tuesday I went to see my Astros and was there to witness Roger Clemens go 7-0, baby!  Go ‘Stros!  The last couple of days have been spent working and ripping my CD collection and uploading the music to my new whiz-bang MP3 player.  Woo!  I love this thing!  Tonight is date night, and so I will be heading out to dinner and such with my guy.  I think this weekend will be pretty low-key.  Church tomorrow night and then possibly a movie or more bowling.  I’ll have to spend a few hours of my weekend in the office.  Hopefully that will not interfere with my Sunday knitting plans over at  urlLink  Sara’s  (She thinks I’m coming over to knit but really I’m coming to play with her cats.  Shhh…).

       There Were Penises Aplenty   I pinned a paper penis to a poster of a “Macho Man” wearing only a strategically placed bulls-eye.  I was blindfolded and dizzy and I think I missed wide-right.  There was a pink penis piñata.  Someone has multiple photographs of me wearing a tiara -- without the matching  Gold Digger (like a hooker…only smarter)  t-shirt to complete the skank-ho Trish ensemble.  There was a pink penis piñata.  I learned that  Assablanca  and  Slap ’er in ‘er Crapper  are not, in fact, real porn films, and the shady meanings of seemingly innocent words such as, “vegetarian,” and “parachute.”  This can only mean one thing – last night was my first experience with  urlLink H-Town Bloggers ’ Tiara Happy Hour night, and the top floor of the  urlLink Flying Saucer Draught Emporium  was our playground.  Why all the penises, you ask?  Well, because last night’s THH was one part happy hour, three parts bachelorette party – shaken, not stirred.  I don’t know, though -- I have my suspicions about this group and their penis fetishes…  Here’s who I got to meet:   urlLink The Diva  herself:  OK, so I’ve known her for a while, but she was my date for the event and I couldn’t leave her out.  I do have to say, though, that she was a perfect gentlewoman…although, I’m pretty sure I caught her looking at my ass once or twice.   urlLink The Big Pink Cookie :  The evening’s blogger of honor, the bachelorette herself, Ms.-soon-to-be-Mrs. Christine.  Congrats, Christine.  It was lovely to meet you and watch you run around the bar soliciting kisses and chest hair (you didn’t really do that one did you?) from strange men.  Oh…and the seduction of the bartender was priceless!  The Hostess With the Mostest…penises:   urlLink I Don’t Think ’s very own Emily.  The games!  The prizes!  The penis shaped straws!  Hey, do you do office parties?   urlLink Chica Chic :  Three words:  In.  Freaking.  Sane.  The lovely Chica was disqualified from the Pin-the-Penis competition after breaking the no-touching-the-poster-of-the-naked-man rule by instituting her own strategy – humping-the-poster-of-the-naked-man.  And I have a picture of this.  Oh yes, I do!  Contact me to negotiate a price, Chica…   urlLink  Natalie! :  My fellow Texans lover!  My partner in trash-talking!  It was so nice to meet you.  Thank you for being the one to select my paper penis for me.   urlLink  Katie! :  She has a cat.  She’s tall.  She’s an attorney.  She’s being Katie.  And that, my friends, equates to cool.  Kidless cat owners unite!  I was sassed by the sasser, herself:   urlLink Sassy McSmartpants .  Sarah, dude, you freakin’ crack me up.   urlLink  The Girl :  Hey, Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft  is  hot.   urlLink  The Neurotic Fishbowl :  Seems like a fun type o’ gal…   urlLink  The Cybertoad :  It’s always nice to meet a fellow Cubana…OK, well, not  always , but in this particular instance, it was nice.  And a few others that I met and regret not really getting a chance to chat with:   urlLink  Unmixy Things ,  urlLink  Jenn ,  urlLink  Mrs. David Boreanaz  (glad you dragged your anti-social butt out).  Did I mention there was a pink penis piñata?

       Cinco de Mayo   What the heck is it?  Well, I'm glad you asked!  Most people don't know that back in 1912, Hellmann's mayonnaise was manufactured in England.  In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York.  This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico.    But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.  The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss.  Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day.  The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as:    Sinko de Mayo.   (Credit:  Dad, Ralph, Doug, Jim, Amy, Marge...STOP SENDING THIS TO ME!)

       It’s Not Mean If It’s Hilarious   It is not nice to laugh at people being injured.  And really it’s not even funny.  So do NOT laugh at  urlLink  this video  of the misfortune that befell a news reporter on live television.  And under no circumstances should you adjust the volume so that you can hear the woman yelping like an injured Bassett Hound or surmise by the smirk and simulated compassion on the faces of the in-studio anchors that the entire studio busted a gut as soon as they went to commercial…'cause that would be  wrong .

       All the Birth Control I Need   I spent the day on Saturday marooned at my sister’s house by an apocalyptic storm that could only have been the result of a gross lack of finger-crossing on your part (see previous post).  Thanks, guys.  If only we could summon your powers for good and not evil…  I wound up sleeping over at my sister’s house on Friday night after the ballgame (go ‘Stros!) so that I could baby-sit the two little ones ( urlLink Emily – 3 yrs and Brandon - 17 months ) while she accompanied my oldest niece ( urlLink Alexis  – 14 yrs) to her early morning softball game.  They left at 6am and I got up to wish my niece luck and threaten my sister with bodily harm were she to return even one minute late from that game.  I went back to bed until I heard  urlLink Brandon  whining through the baby monitor around 7.  I trotted to the kitchen and fixed him a bottle before plucking him from his crib and changing his diaper.  I sat on the couch with him on my lap while he drank his bottle and rested his head on my chest.  I played with his hair and nuzzled and kissed his little head while we watched  Jo-Jo’s Circus , followed by  The Wiggles  (and here I thought that the gayest men on television were on the Bravo channel).  Emily emerged from her room in pink jammies looking like some kind of curly-headed troll doll, in time to curl up on the couch with us and watch  Stanley  and  Rollie Pollie Ollie .  And the sweetness of a Saturday morning spent on the couch watching the Disney channel under a blanket with two sleepy-eyed kids ends here.    By the time  House of Mouse  rolled around the kiddos were fully awake and had shed their sweet angel skins, exposing the mutants they harbored underneath.  My sister and Alexis strolled in from their rained-out softball game mere moments before I had decided that locking the kids in the clothes hamper would be a good idea.  They brought the rain with them.  It rained and rained and rained and rained and rained.  I kept telling myself that I would make the 45 minute drive home just as soon as it lightened up a little.  Uh-uh.  Didn’t happen.  I spent the entire day at the mercy of three kids who didn’t want anything to do with my sister because I was in the house - someone new to torture.  I was a horsie.  I was “it” for a thousand games of hide-and-seek.  I played an endless game of airplane (accomplished by lying on the floor on my back and balancing a kid on the top of my feet).  I participated in a tea party with a frog, a bunny, two dogs and Barney the Dinosaur.  I was the official booty-wiper -- I have to tell you, there is nothing like hearing the words, “I’m doooo-OOOOne!” and walking into the bathroom to find a three-year-old with her rear-end in the air.  I managed to escape around 4 pm with a busted lip that occurred when Alexis accidentally elbowed me in the mouth while jockeying for position on the couch -- hey, you snooze you lose, dude; and a severely bruised knee that occurred while performing a triple-lutz triple-Salchow combination on the kitchen floor and slamming all 125 pounds of myself directly onto my right kneecap at precisely the spot where one of the little freaks had spilled some water; and a tender, yet thankfully, not visibly bruised cheekbone after hearing the words, “Hey [Zammi]!  Catch!” and turning just in time to take a tennis ball to the face delivered by the three-year-old mutant child who was standing mere inches from me.  And there are people who purposely bring these little monsters into the world?  I tell you, I love those three kids more than life itself, but a day with them is all the birth control I need.  They exhaust me.  My sister spent the day laughing (she did the pee-pee dance when I did the Michelle Kwan on her kitchen floor) and proclaiming, “Welcome to my world!”  I don’t know how she does it.

       Undeniably Monday   I got into my vehicle this morning, set my stuff on the passenger seat, turned the key, flipped the radio station over to my favorite morning show and drove for a couple of blocks before glancing over at the bag of cat poop sitting on the seat next to me.  Cat poop.  In a little grocery store baggie.  On my seat.  I don’t know why I was so surprised; after all, I put it there.  Somewhere, along the course of rolling out of bed at 5am, showering, dressing, and primping, I cleaned out the cat’s litter box, scooping the soiled clumps of litter into one of the little plastic vegetable baggies that I  steal  save from the grocery store, with the intention of depositing it in the trashcan in the kitchen on my way out the door.  I walked to the kitchen twice, bag o’ poop in hand, before I left the house, and  still , I carried out to my truck -- along with my purse, a stack of CDs for a coworker, a banana, and a little carton of orange juice -- a bag of kitty poo.  What is  wrong  with me?!?  Some sort of early form of Alzheimer’s?    I suppose the fact that Mr. Stinkers’ turds didn’t make it all the way to my office with me (I swung into a gas station and tossed the bag into one of the trash bins next to the pumps) could be counted as evidence against the theory that I am losing my mind.  Although, perhaps not enough to raise reasonable doubt…  Go ‘Stros.

       A Snack's Lament   Why is it that when you are munching away at your desk and happen to drop a piece of whatever you might be eating, it always seems to gravitate precisely into the path of one of your chair’s casters?  It doesn’t matter which direction you move -- left, right, back -– because your chosen snack will get up and dive under the nearest wheel, as if preferring to commit snack suicide rather than succumb to the Three-Second Rule and be popped back into your mouth.  Not that I would  ever  do such a thing…  I was recently…Ok, am  currently …nibbling on a  Hershey’s  bar, a morsel of which abandoned all hope for a better life and leapt from its wrapper and onto the carpet of my Pit of Despair.  I sat perfectly still so as not to roll over the thing and mash it into the carpet, looking all around.  Failing to uncover the chameleon chocolate, yet, refusing to be outwitted by a piece of candy, I faked left and rolled right.  *crunch* ( ...with Almonds )  This was clearly a candy suicide, as I dropped the thing on the left side of my chair and it was killed by on-coming caster traffic on the right.  Perhaps that crunch was the lament of a candy on the brink of despair.  After all, it must be a stressful life behind that glass; watching friends and loved ones, one by one, inexplicably and without warning, take a plunge off the edge of the cliff, never to return.  I’m not sure what the suicide rate for snack foods is around your desk, but the  Rold Golds  and  Cheetos  are leading the pack around mine.  Go ‘Stros.

       Poor Puppy   As promised, here are some photos of the living conditions of my neighbors’ doggie (I apologize for the quality and poor angles; I was in a hurry so as not to be noticed hanging over the fence and snapping pictures).  Notice the muddy bog that has become of his living room, and that domed shaped thing in the front right corner is the master bedroom –- which he will not enter, for whatever reason (but I am guessing it is because it is wet inside)-- and so just stands out in the rain and cries.  Also, take a gander at his kitchen-swamp and the bowl of dirty RAINWATER that he has to drink.  Click to enlarge:    urlLink            urlLink         I stopped by my vet’s office this afternoon to pick up some pet food and talked to her about this situation.  She gave me some numbers to call (Humane Society and SPCA), but said that as much as it angers and breaks our hearts, if he is being fed and has some sort of shelter, there is nothing, legally, that they can do.  She also told me that because of the nature of this situation, the case will most likely be pushed to the bottom of the list because he’s not being physically harmed (like beaten or anything), but that I should call anyway and keep calling if they don’t show up to investigate within a few days.  I feel so bad for this dog.  He’s all muddy and wet and really has no dry place to lie down.  The least they could do is throw a tarp over the top of the fencing for a little shade and shelter.  Perhaps I am making too much of this and poking my nose where it does not belong, but I simply cannot understand how those people can just ignore his whines and whimpers.  I mean, he’s pretty healthy looking, so someone is feeding him.  How much trouble is it to throw a stick or a ball and let him run around the yard for a little bit?  To pet him a little?  He has such a precious little face.  He’s a good looking little fella.  Go ‘Stros.

       WWYD?  What Would Y’all Do?   Here’s the thing:  A couple of months ago, I noticed a new dog in the backyard of the house next door.  It is a lovely young yellow Lab (or so it appears to my untrained eye).  Now, they have a pretty good-sized backyard; nice green grass and plenty of room to run and play, yet, the dog is in a cage.  Morning, noon, and night, that poor dog is in its cage.  It’s probably a 6X6 cage (again, by my untrained eye) and in this cage are the dog’s food and water bowls and a little doggy-igloo thingy that I suppose is intended to provide shade or shelter or whatever.  All of this is in the dog’s cage along with the dog.  I cannot say that the dog has never left that cage, I am only suggesting that I have never  seen  the dog outside of the cage.  It is there when I get up in the morning, when I get home from work in the evening and when I go to bed at night.  Even on the weekends, the dog remains locked up.  Obviously, someone is feeding and watering the poor creature and cleaning his poop out of the cage (yes, he poops in there too, which indicates to me that they are not walking him).  This is Southeast Texas.  The heat index was 105 degrees this weekend and, this week, it has rained almost non-stop.  The grass is soaked and for whatever reason, the dog won’t go into its igloo (perhaps because it is waterlogged), so it just stands there, in the rain, whimpering.  It breaks my freaking heart.  Every time I go outside, he peeks at me through the boards in the fence as if begging for help.  He’s soaked.  He’s shivering.  And those dang people have a covered patio back there!  If they don’t want him in the house, they could at least put him in the patio while it rains!  Why would they take this dog if they were only going to ignore it and lock it in a cage?  I would not feel comfortable knocking on these people's door and suggesting to them that they are being cruel to this animal -- they are very rednecky –- so, I am thinking about calling the ASPCA (anonymously); however, I don’t know if this is a situation that they could actually do anything about.  I mean…can they force people to pay attention to their dog?  And what if they come out and my neighbors lie and say they walk him twice a day and play with him and such?  I feel like I have to do something for this poor baby.  Help!  Go Stros  (they need help too) .

       The Day Eddie Fell In   On Saturday, I participated in what was officially called The 19th Annual TOPPS Poker Run, but, for a few of us, will forever be known as The Day Eddie Fell In.  Main Entry: 1pok•er run Pronunciation: ‘pO-k&r run’ Function: noun 1: a gathering of dozens upon dozens of performance speed boats for an all day water event, culminating in a hand of poker in which the winning boat captain will walk away with thousands of dollars 2: the consumption of alcohol beginning at 10 am and ending at 11 pm; especially on a boat with your friends, some of whom are flashing bystanders as we zip by  That wasn’t us -- the winning and the walking away with the thousands of dollars, I mean.  Entry number two – THAT was us.  All we had was a lousy pair of fours, but we sure had fun!  Basically, we had to race over to five stops (various on-the-water bars and restaurants spread out so that each stop took us 30 minutes to an hour to reach by water), and for every stop, our captain (my sweetheart of a boyfriend), received one playing card, so that at the end of this very long day, each captain had a hand of poker to play.  Whomever drew the best hand out of the seventy-five participating boats, won.  Simple.     But I did not write this post so that I could tell you that all we had was a lousy pair of fours; my intent was, and is, to tell you the circumstances surrounding The Day Eddie Fell In.  With so many boats participating in the Poker Run, none of the various establishments on the map had enough docks to accommodate us all – we traveled in one large pack so that we arrived together and left together (it was quite a sight if you were in the area) – so we had to stack our boats.  Meaning that the first boats arriving to a location would tie off to the dock and the next line of boats would tie off to those boats and so on, and then you would simply walk across everyone’s boats to reach the dock.     At the particular stop in which Eddie fell in – now a historic spot in our memories – we were the last boat on a stack of at least ten or twelve.  Eddie, God love him, successfully picked his way over all of these boats, only to reach the dock and look up as someone called his name, and took that fateful extra step…off the dock and straight into the water.  My guy’s best friend and not a small man by any stretch of the imagination, Eddie plunged off the dock and sunk like a rock, straight to the bottom of the bay.   My guy and I and the two other friends that were on our boat with Eddie, along with about a hundred other bystanders, all stood there on the dock, waiting for him to come up, for what seemed like an eternity, but was actually only about three seconds.  Just as my guy was about to jump in after him, Eddie, whose plunge into the bay landed him all of twelve feet under water and calf-deep in mud, popped up like a cork and cracking up.  And the man never let go of his shoes.  Proper boat-stacking etiquette, if there is such a thing, teaches one to remove his/her shoes before walking across someone’s boat.  Eddie fell into the bay with his size 11 tennis shoes in his hand and managed to kick his way free of the mud-hole that he had fallen into, and never let go of his shoes.  I don’t know if it was the relief that I felt upon seeing his jolly face pop up out of the water, or the thought that I almost had to put my CPR training to use for the first time on good ol’ Eddie and not on Orlando Bloom as I had hoped, but I found the site of him, treading water with his shoes in one hand, hat in the other, absolutely hysterical.  I had to walk away so as not to laugh in his bobbing face.  This particular stop also happened to be our lunch stop, so after Eddie changed into some dry clothes (Boating rule # 1:  Always be prepared) he sat across from me at our table tilting his cell phone back and forth and pointing out how the water moved the bubbles around the screen, while I made a money-tree out of the soaked bills from his wallet and the floral arrangement on our table.  And this was only stop number two of five on our journey to a pair of fours.     Go ‘Stros.

       Nary a Shred of “Hot Monty Action” To Speak Of   Summer is upon us, and along with the stifling heat and bad-hair-day inducing humidity comes crappy television programming.  That’s how you know it’s summer.  The nationally syndicated train-wrecks offered up by the networks herald the summer season more accurately than the tilting of the earth’s axis.  Honestly, you can use your TV Guide to gauge the seasonal shift.  What’s this…a new season of  Who Wants To Marry My Dad ?  Well, I guess it’s time to take the cover off of the pool.  Did I just see Paris Hilton on TV again?  I better go move my sweaters back into the hall closet.  I watch very little television on summer evenings.  Unless my Astros are on, I am most likely to be found away from the TV.    The only show that I am currently following at all is  Last Comic Standing ; although, I must confess that I did sit through this week’s premier of  Next Action Star  (I seriously dislike Viviana).  I don’t actually plan on watching this show again -- I stumbled upon it after becoming so infuriated with the Astros game on Tuesday night that I nearly broke my thumb stomping through the channels, in hopes of seeing someone, ANYONE get a hit (come on guys!).  I don’t know.  Maybe I am missing some quality programming out there.  What are you guys watching these days?  Go ‘Stros.

       What About Bob?   I had my company-mandated CPR training this morning.  I am naturally opposed to anything mandated, but I didn’t mind the class.  It’s something that I have been telling myself that I needed to do anyway, what with all of the time I spend with the midgets and all.  Bob.  Just plain ol’ Bob.  That was our dummy’s name, and let me tell you, Bob died a thousand deaths in THAT class.  Ok, so maybe it was more like a dozen or so, but every one of us let Bob die at least once.  I killed Bob out of spite for the instructor -- Sorry about that, Bob, but she was an idiot (that lady was TOTALLY picking on me!).  And the most hilarious question goes to the coworker, who so seriously inquired of our instructor, “So…what if you are having to perform CPR on a woman with some kind of jumbo breast implants and you can’t get to her breastbone?”  …With hand gestures indicating BOTH size and shape.  It is a valid question, given that the chances of a guy stumbling upon an unconscious Pamela Anderson increase dramatically upon CPR certification.  It’s true…  Go ‘Stros.

       I’m Giddy   …Over Jessica Simpson.  Wait!  Let me explain!  See, the tickets that I purchased for the show next month just arrived in the mail yesterday.  Wait!  Let me explain!  It’s not that I am at all a fan of Jessica Simpson.  I am not.  Shakira is my dirty little secret-pop-music-indulgence, not Jessica.  I did buy tickets to the upcoming show, but only because my 14-year-old niece LOVES her.  See?  It’s  her ; not  me .  My impeccable musical tastes would never be sullied by an affinity for something so…so cheesy.  So then, why the giddiness over the cheese-girl?  It is because my niece, who LOVES her, has absolutely no idea that I purchased tickets for the show, and it is the anticipation of the look on her face when I spring them on her that has me all psyched.  I can’t wait.  I haven’t yet decided how I will do it -- the springing of the tickets on the little girl who LOVES Jessica Simpson -- but I will definitely wait until the day of the show.  I should probably keep an extra outfit handy for her due to the elevated risk of pants-peeing.  I will have to lie to her as to where I am actually taking her.  I’m thinking that I may fabricate some story about how a pair of Comets tickets fell into my lap and that I will be picking her up after work if she wants to go (the show is on a Wednesday night).  Then I would wait until we were actually walking up to the arena to hand her the ticket that says  JESSICA SIMPSON  across the face of it.  Of course, I run the risk of having her show up to a Jessica Simpson concert in a Tina Thompson jersey, but that’s a minor detail that can be remedied by a quick trip to the merch booth.  I haven’t thought about this at all…  Hee!  I can’t wait.  I keep thinking of her little face and just grinning to myself like an idiot.  I am not yet considering the fact that, once I get to watch her die and squeal and pee her pants, I will have to sit through the actual show.  Thousands of teenies squealing, “Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!”    Ah, heck…it’s totally worth it.  Go ‘Stros.

        "Money, it’s a hit. Don’t give me that do goody good bullshit…"    I was having a conversation today with someone (off the crapper), who was relaying a story to me about going through the drive-thru of a fast food joint today and being handed back the wrong amount of change.  The cashier made an error in his favor, and he ended up driving away with free food and extra money.  I just can’t do that.  I always give the money back even if it means that I have to drive back to the restaurant or store.  It would eat at me.  My conscience, it would.  I am of the opinion that it is not my money to keep.  Some people are of the opinion that the extra cash is recompense for the many instances of screwed up orders and missing ketchup packets.  Point taken.  I’m the kind of weenie that will drive all the way back to an establishment to return their money, but will not turn the car around to complain when they get my order wrong.  Others argue that lost change here and there is just the price that these places pay for hiring incompetent employees who are unable to make proper change for a twenty, even with the correct amount flashing on a screen in front of them.  Point taken.  So my question to you guys and gals is this:  What do YOU do?  At one time or another, each of us has been faced with this situation.  Do you pocket the cash or give it back?  Or does it depend, for you, on whether or not the cashier was friendly?  Humor me people.  Go ‘Stros.

       Public Service Announcement   My brother called me a little bit ago.  He and I are pretty tight and I was ranting about a couple of things.  Mostly I was expressing my case of the wiggins over finding yet another note from my  urlLink  psycho ex-boyfriend , wrapped in plastic and tucked neatly under the windshield wiper of my truck this morning.  Yeah, I know, creepy as hell, but I am resolved to not let it get to me.  I’ll pause here for a moment to allow you sufficient time to pat me on the back…ok, there…get off me.  But Creepy Creeperton is not the point of this post.  Oh no, ladies and gentleman, I have a much more disturbing agenda -- the point of  this  post is to make public the fact that I sat here and poured my heart out to my brother for a good twenty minutes before realizing that he had been ON THE CRAPPER the ENTIRE TIME.  And some of  urlLink  you  who are dating him need to know this!  Oh yes, dear brother, I am calling you out!  I’m calling you out as a toilet-talker!  A potty-prattler!  A john-jabberer!  A  can-caller !  After all, it was YOU, who called ME!  Were you bored?  Had you not a SINGLE THING to read in the apartment?  Good God, man!  Have you no shame?   There I was, chatting away ON MY LUNCH HOUR, when he actually said the words:  “Hey, can you hang on for like 30 seconds?”  “Sure, go ahead”  *nibble nibble on my sandwich*  [toilet flushing in the background]  “Dude, my legs were falling asleep...”  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!  That is so freaking gross!  *letch*  Go ‘Stros.

       I Need a Haircut…Maybe   I have reached that proverbial fork in the road.  The fork though, interestingly enough, rests on my head and my hair is wrapped around it like so much spaghetti.  I have been floundering for weeks now about what to do with the mop on my head.  The length of my hair has reached the awkward state in which it is too long to be short, and yet too short to be long.    My hair, normally bobbed to just below my ears, has sprouted like a Chia Pet watered by my indecision, and is now dangling precariously just above my shoulders.  It grows incredibly fast, you see.  A fact that I like to attribute to the beehive of activity going on in my head, which causes my hair to be shoved through my scalp as my brain swells with brilliance; and  not  to some sort of conspiracy contrived by my hairstylist and the manufacturers of whatever goop she plops on my head and swears is just a cream rinse.  Should I cut it?  I like it short.  I enjoy being able to just tuck it behind my ears and be done with it.  And it  is  almost summertime (though, judging by our 95 degree weather here, you would have thought that summer started about a month ago).  And I like being able to just slap my Astros cap on my head and not worry about my hair sticking out all over the place.  But when it is short like that, I can’t pull it up in a ponytail to keep it out of my face when I need to.  And I can’t do my pigtails.  I like my pigtails.  It is already almost at my shoulders; if I cut it now and then decide that I really want to let it grow out, then I will have lost all of those inches.  And if it does reach my shoulders, then I will have “shoulder-length hair” and not something in between not-short-enough and not-long-enough.   That , my friends, is the long and the short of it, and I still have no idea what I will do.  Ch-ch-ch-Chia!  Go ‘Stros.

      I reached a television watching low tonight reminiscent of that time I lost the remote and begrudgingly sat through an episode of  Forever Eden  when I refused to physically get up and change the channel because doing so would somehow mean that the television had won.&nbsp; It was in the bathroom…the remote, not the TV.  Only this was worse because the remote was sitting right there, in plain view.&nbsp; It wasn’t hiding in the bathroom; it was raising a brow at my viewing choice, mere inches from my right leg.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I was watching the Astros game and actually  flipping back and forth  between the game and this show…on purpose.  I watched  Amish in the City  tonight…on purpose.  It’s true.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; And what’s worse is that I am planning on watching next week.&nbsp;    Somebody help me…   Go ‘Stros.

      My first post-op visit to my podiatrist today was eventful, to say the least. To my credit I only almost fainted once….ok, so it was twice, but the hyperventilation was short-lived and the tears minimal.   Oh, didn’t I tell you? I am the biggest wimp there ever was. Having never broken a bone or had stitches or anything more serious than a sprain in my entire life, my body, and consequently, my mind, have not been conditioned to process pain well at all. And here I am dealing with a broken bone in my foot and stitches and pins all at the same time. My poor guy had no idea what he was getting himself into when he so gallantly offered to drive me to the doctor today. He was so supportive, though, holding my wimpy little hand and making me laugh like that. *sigh* I tell you, this guy of mine, he’s a keeper. But that’s a story for another time and a different post.   When the bandages came off my foot today, I couldn’t even look. Already well acquainted with my squeamishness from my pre-op visits, Alberta, the nurse and convincingly the sweetest old black lady I have ever met in my entire life, leaned the bed back so that I wouldn’t have to watch her slowly unwrap my foot before me like some kind of macabre gift. Curiosity got the best of me and by the time she was down to the last bandage, that last shroud of gauze, I peeked.   I really shouldn’t have done that.   It was black. And purple. And yellow. And this exquisite shade of green that I would really love in a blouse. And there were stitches and this little white knobby thing that was the head of the removable pin that has been living in my foot (which, incidentally, looked really cool on the x-ray today), along with the two more permanent pins, for the last week.   Alberta had me lean back and avert my eyes while she removed the catheter that had also been living in my foot for the last week. I whimpered for no reason at all; it didn’t even hurt. It was mostly just the fright of having someone touch my foot.   What did hurt and cause me to hyperventilate and tear up and nearly faint was the removal of that blasted pin. Alberta, the sweetheart, held my hand and patted my head and coached me through the whole thing. Get me some ice chips, I was giving birth! My podiatrist, ignoring my pleas to just rip it out quickly like a Band-Aid, attached some kind of little crank to it which he turned and sloooooooowly removed the pin.   After cleaning up the afterbirth, the good ol’ doc informed me that I am to keep my butt planted at home and off of my foot for another week…at least. ANOTHER WEEK. I have already been climbing the walls for the boredom! I was actually looking forward to going back to work tomorrow, though I had no idea how I would get there, since I can’t drive and can barely muster up a good hobble. Oh well, I suppose I should stop complaining about being bored and thank God that I have a job that provides insurance to cover all of this and is paying me to stay home and recover.   But I’m not good at being bored, dammit…   Go ‘Stros.

      Well, I got all registered for the fall semester of school today, and I will confess that I shuffled a class from Tuesday nights to Thursday nights to accommodate The Amazing Race (and Last Comic Standing).   Sad, but true.   And how much do I love Charla and Mirna? Those two just  kill  me! If they don’t win it all I will be bitterly disappointed in this, my freshman year as a TAR fan. There is just narrowly a runner-up for me in Linda and Karen, but even they are a far cry from the unwitting slapstick of the midget and her cousin.   Ah, but for every love there must be a corresponding hate, inversely proportional in its own grotesque beauty. For me, this elegant loathing is manifested in the doughy existence of brothers Marshall and Lance, the consummate assholes. I love to hate those jerks.   Go ‘Stros.

      Man, I have to tell you, I am  gorgeous  today.&nbsp; My foot is in a sling; I have a zit on my face – courtesy of that ass who filled my candy jar with Hershey’s Caramel Kisses – tentatively named Mt. Popapimple, but will be dubbed Crater Lake as soon as she blows; and hair that looks as if I’ve spent the day rubbing a pork chop on my head because I have failed to shower today.  &nbsp;  I feel  so  pretty…  &nbsp;  And it’s not that I did not have time to shower today, because, let’s face it, I’ve had nothing but time on my hands since my foot surgery this past Thursday (Goodness…is it Sunday night, already?).&nbsp; It’s that showering, and anything that requires me to stand or walk for that matter, is almost more trouble than it’s worth.&nbsp; Oh, and there is the small matter of my having discontinued the use of my pain medication as of yesterday evening, thusly, making anything that requires standing or walking  that  much more trouble.&nbsp; Honestly, I move from the bed to the couch, from the couch to the bed, spending much of my day in a battle of mind over bladder, because, sure, I have to pee, but peeing is one of those activities that requires  both  standing  and  walking.  &nbsp;  Sure, Doc, I’ll be back to have my other foot done just as soon as this one is all healed up…  &nbsp;  I stopped popping my pain pills every four hours, as directed, because, while they do dull the throb in my foot, they also make me sleep, and consequently, miss hour after hour of wholesome daytime television.&nbsp; My weekend was narrowly rescued by the fact that my Astros had televised mid-afternoon games  both  yesterday  and  today.&nbsp; I panicked yesterday when I turned on the television during one of my swims up from my medicinally-induced groggy fog, only to realize that it was  Saturday  and there would be no Spanish court TV on for me that day.&nbsp; That  Sala de Parejas  on Telemundo is something else -- love that Judge Ana Maria Polo!  &nbsp;  Foot-fetishers at the ready!&nbsp; Below you will find a picture of my beautiful foot, resplendent in all its bandaged glory and accessorized in a sturdy, yet fashionable blue post-op shoe (I spared y’all a picture of the volcano on my face…you’re welcome).  &nbsp;      &nbsp;  The stickers are courtesy of my three-year-old niece, who fixes every "bo-bo" with stickers and kisses (aww...), and the roundish-looking container taped to my foot is a medicinal pump attached to a catheter that injects .5ml of relief directly into my foot every hour.&nbsp; I suppose this small miracle of modern medicine is the liquid courage that has allowed me to forego the extra pill-popping with discomfort, yes, but only real pain when I stand or walk.&nbsp; It comes out on Tuesday, by the way (God, help me).  &nbsp;  Mind over bladder, friends…  &nbsp;  I am not scheduled to return to work until this coming Thursday, and with my days of convalescence no longer spent in a drug-induced coma; my surgically-induced home confinement; and the veritable fruitcake of programming offered by daytime television –  Sala de Parejas  only lasts an hour, mang -- I have loads of time on my hands.  &nbsp;  Thus, I am happy to announce that coming soon to your very own End of the Internet is:&nbsp;  Extreme Makeover:&nbsp; Blog Edition .  &nbsp;  Some of you are chuckling and others of you are wondering what is so funny, because, really, the Extreme Makeover thing, while cute, is not all that amusing and perhaps  urlLink Gretchen  was right in worrying that the funny would be sucked right out of this blog along with my pelicula.&nbsp; But, see, the chucklers are chuckling because they know that, over the course of the past year (can you believe this blog is a year old?), I have threatened and re-threatened to makeover this blog and, like orange to green and back again, nothing has materialized.  &nbsp;  Only, this time, I mean it.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Stop chuckling, chucklers, I have already begun to work on a new layout.&nbsp; I have decided to go with something much more clean and minimalistic (if that isn’t a word, I fall back on my temporary, yet handy, excuse:&nbsp; it’s the drugs talking).&nbsp; Take some time to say your goodbyes to Le Fils – the apple-faced gentleman on your left – he shan’t be making the move; though, I have decided to keep the title,&nbsp;"End of the Internet," in an effort to accommodate the thousands – nay,  scads  -- of you whom have been so generous in reserving a few precious pixels of blog real estate for a link to this blog (seriously, thank you for that).  &nbsp;  And now, I&nbsp;shall hobble slowly, oh so slowly, off to bed where I will&nbsp;close my eyes and dread the shower that I must, for the love of Judge Polo, take in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You know, this really could have been three posts (as far as you are concerned,  urlLink Peggy , this  is  three posts!)…  &nbsp;  Go ‘Stros.

       Two tickets to the Jessica Simpson concert:&nbsp; $110  T-shirt, program, and glow-stick:&nbsp; $65  Taking your 14-year-old niece to her very first concert:&nbsp; Priceless   &nbsp;      &nbsp;  Her reaction to reaching into my purse for what she thought were movie tickets and pulling out Jessica Simpson tickets was priceless too:  &nbsp;  “  Oh!    &nbsp;    My!    &nbsp;    GOD!!!  ”  &nbsp;  *claps hand to side of face and stares at tickets, mouth agape*  &nbsp;  What a great night.&nbsp; The look on her face is forever burned in my memory.&nbsp; I told her that we would be leaving in an hour and her brain went into overdrive:  &nbsp;  “OMG!&nbsp; How should I do my hair?&nbsp; Up or down?&nbsp; Will we be sitting or standing?&nbsp; Are there seats?&nbsp; Will it be loud?&nbsp; How many people will be there?&nbsp; Will Nick be there?&nbsp; I wonder where she is right now!&nbsp; Can we find her dressing room?&nbsp; I wonder what songs she will sing…”  &nbsp;  On the drive to the arena she kept telling me that she was going to throw-up for the excitement.&nbsp; The kid couldn’t sit still.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; We got to the arena and found our seats and naturally, the show was almost an hour late in getting started.&nbsp; Some dork named Ryan Cabrera opened the show.&nbsp; I had no idea who he was, but according to my niece (who didn’t really care for him either), he is Jessica’s sister’s boyfriend.&nbsp; Go figure.  &nbsp;  After his set and another thirty minute wait, Jessica took to the stage amidst the high-pitched shrieking noises that can only be produced by girls 16 and under.&nbsp; My niece was grinning ear-to-ear and screaming and waving her  Jessica Simpson:&nbsp; Reality Tour  glow-stick and singing all the words to every song.&nbsp; I didn’t know any words to any song but I screamed at all the appropriate places right along with her.&nbsp; I had so much fun just watching that kid squeal.  &nbsp;      &nbsp;  Our seats were decent – on the floor and about 20 rows back from the stage.&nbsp; After Jessica said, “Goodnight, Houston!&nbsp; I love you!” and everyone in front of us began to file out, I grabbed my niece and pulled her, against the flow of rookie concert-goers, to the front of the stage.&nbsp; I whispered to her, “There’ll be an encore.&nbsp; She hasn’t done the ‘t-shirt’ song yet.”&nbsp; So we waited for a minute or two and sure enough, out came Jessica to sing that blasted “t-shirt” song (the only song that I actually knew most of the words to, due to my niece forcing me to listen to it a million times).  &nbsp;      &nbsp;  The kid left the arena on a Jessica Simpson high that I suspect lasted throughout the next day (she slept in her concert t-shirt) while she was calling all of her friends to inform them of her whereabouts the night before.  &nbsp;  This night, a night that neither of us is likely to forget, was well worth the month that I had to hold my tongue and lie to her about the tickets.  &nbsp;  Go ‘Stros.

      In less than an hour, my beloved Houston Astros will hold a press conference to announce the dismissal of Coach Jimy Williams and the subsequent beheading of the entire coaching staff.   Now, I agree that my ‘Stros have had a lackluster first half -- after leading their division for the first month of the season, they have since dropped to 10.5 games back. Inexcusable, yes, given the off-season acquisitions of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, and, more recently, Carlos Beltran, but is it really fair to dismiss the entire coaching staff when it is  the players  that aren’t producing? Not to mention the fact that the two players that  are  doing beautifully this year are two guys that we traded? The Mets are loving Hidalgo about as much as Philly loves Billy right now.   I understand that you can’t fire the entire team, but you can coach the heck out of a player and that still isn’t going to make him get a hit (*cough* Bagwell *cough*) or not commit an error (*cough* Kent *cough*).   I love you guys, but man, y’all look like a JV team out there.   This was supposed to be  our  season. We should be at the top of our division – and we were…for about a minute. What good is The Rocket if he can’t get run support? He’s 10-3 and two of those losses I will saddle, arguably, on the backs of our hitters. Come on, guys, there is just no excuse for losing a game 1-0, when Roger strikes out ten plus.   I hated hearing our own crowd “boo” Jimy Williams at the All Star game last night. I just don’t see our lack of production being a coaching issue. It’s the players. I love each and every one of them, but this season’s downward spiral belongs to them.   I guess we shall just have to wait and see what happens after this house-cleaning. Maybe the boys will wake up and start playing some ball in the second half.   Go ‘Stros.

      Tonight, friends, is THE NIGHT! Wheeeee!!!   Aww, c’mon…don’t y’all remember? I’m talking about  urlLink  this   night!   Yep, I get to surprise my fourteen-year-old niece with tickets to see Jessica  Simpleton  Simpson tonight. My goodness, that kid has  no idea ! She whimpers every time she sees/hears Jessica Simpson  anything . For the last several weeks she would just look at me with these pleading eyes and I would just say something like, “Oh…she’s coming to town?” and just blow her off. She finally abandoned all hope for going to the show when it was brought to her attention that tonight, the night of the show, is my Dad’s birthday, so the family will be taking him out to dinner.   She has no freaking clue that she and I will instead be going to the show! I can’t even begin to tell you how hard it has been for me to sit on these tickets for over a month now and not let on that I have them!   I can’t wait to surprise her! I’ll post her reaction sometime tomorrow. Hee!   Go ‘Stros!

        From the EIP (End of the Internet Press)  :   The latest inductee to the  Hey Zam, Has Anyone Ever Told You That You Look Like _________ Club  is none another than Kiran Chetry, Co-host of the  Fox and Friends  morning news program on the Fox News channel.     In a rather unceremonious event, the Chetry Zam-alike was unveiled this morning when an employee approached an unsuspecting Zam as she responded to a technical support request from another user:    -Hey Zam…do you watch Fox News in the mornings?   -Umm…no. I watch myself tearing through the house and running late every morning. Why, what am I missing?   -You look like Kiran from Fox and Friends. I watch every morning and I always think of you when I see her …   And with that simple phrase, club membership, nearing societal proportions, grew to three.   Previous inductees to the HZHAETYTYLL_C include the likes of Sandra Bullock and Masiela Lusha of George Lopez Show fame:    &nbsp;   Zam, who thus far has remained dubious, incredulous, and equivocal on the matter, was quoted as stating simply, "It must be the bunion, mang."   Go ‘Stros.

       (#4 on Merriam-Webster Online’s  urlLink  Top Ten Favorite Words   list)    Does anyone know what the big kerfuffle (#9 on the list) is with Paige Davis and Star Magazine?   I was perusing my hit list today and noticed that among my usual weekly recurrences of referrals from searches for "mature drunken ladies," "horny wranglers in tight jeans" and "Sandra Bullock’s Adam’s apple," I have a plethora (#5) of hits on this blog coming from various search engines with key words: "Paige Davis + Star Magazine" / "Paige Davis AND Star Magazine" / "Star Magazine, Paige Davis," etc.   Paige Davis? I mean, really, who cares about that persnickety (#8) old hag anyway? One of my  urlLink favorite blogs  refers to her as "that woman who crawled out of Satan’s ass." I love that.   Anyway, I was just wondering what the buzz ("onomatopoeia" is #3) was all about.   Go ‘Stros...Pretty please?  Go  ‘Stros lest the second half of the season suffer the defenestration (The #1 word) of the first.

      You are a thoughtless cretin, bubbling with insensitivity and heedlessness for the delicate complexion of your coworkers – namely, mine! - and will be held personally accountable for each and every blemish on my skin for the next decade. I will name every pimple after you and trail you around the office pointing at it and swearing at you; I will! I fill that jar with candy that I HATE for a reason, schmuck-o!   Well of course I have to eat them! What’s wrong with you? Have you tried these?!?

      Baseball’s All Star Game is in town next week along with my personal favorite: The Home Run Derby. I love baseball. More than any other sport, I am drawn to the crack of the bat and *thwap* of a 95 mile-an-hour fastball hitting leather. I make my way down to Minute Maid Park as often as I can every season to see my Astros in action. So, you can imagine my anguish at having to turn down the opportunity to GET PAID to attend both the All Star Game and Home Run Derby via my security side gig. Oh no, friends, that was not the crack of the bat you heard, but the breaking of my heart.   It’s my feet, you see...   I visited my podiatrist today. I didn’t have a podiatrist before last week, when the pain in my feet became so pronounced as to cause me to bite the bullet and do something about it. As it happens, that  something  involves surgery, next week, on my right foot – the more outspoken of my phalanges.   The All Star festivities are on Monday and Tuesday and I won’t be going under the knife until Thursday; however, I am not able to spend the ten to twelve hours on my feet that each of those events will require.   Ah well, I will sit snuggled tight with my guy and watch from the couch. And really, that’s better anyway, right?   Go ‘Stros.

       Kannst du micke fange?   I’m a sucker.  I freely admit this.  I give homeless people my money and telemarketers love me.  I will politely decline to purchase anything before allowing phone solicitors to get too far into their spiel (I’ve never been able to just hang up on people); however, the telephone survey people always get me to participate.  Radio and television surveyors call me at least once or twice a month.  Earlier this week, the latter group persuaded me to allow them to send me a video of a sitcom pilot episode to review as part of a test audience.  The show was called  Dads  and it was absolutely deplorable.  It featured the guy from  Soul Man ; Ross’s lesbian ex-wife from  Friends ; Blanche from  Golden Girls  with an inexplicable and positively abhorrent German accent; and a handful of nobodies.  The plot (and I use that term loosely) surrounded three guys, all with cutesy little children in kindergarten.  I am a fool if there ever was one.  The thought of possibly throwing my two-cents into our loathsome-of-late television programming was too much to resist.  “Suuuure!  Send me the video,” I volunteered.  Being the  gullible idiot  innocent that I am, it never occurred to me that there could be an ulterior motive involved here (duh!).  Long story short, it was all a marketing scam.  The video arrived with two booklets of household product surveys for me to fill out, and the video itself was littered with commercials – incidentally, as I sit here, I cannot seem to recall even one of the ads (go figure).  I should have caught on to the ploy when I realized that there were dozens of questions about the products and only four questions about the actual show itself.  The return call to retrieve my feedback, the time verified and re-verified by the caller, was to arrive yesterday evening.  Unfortunately, I was out and about with my sister and the midgets until about 11pm last night (oops…), so I suppose I missed my opportunity to express my disgust at being misguided into a product survey under the guise of a television pilot.  That’s what I get for sitting still…  Go ‘Stros!

      I joined this Yahoo! Group the other day that was set up to help gather up everyone for next summer’s ten-year high school reunion. The class of ’95.  My  graduating class. So why is it that I have no idea who any of these people are?  I’ve been hanging in the shadows, just reading everyone’s posts and conversations, and I feel so completely alienated from these people. I literally recognize enough names to count on one hand. Not only that, but many of these people are married with children already, and some of them have been married, divorced, and remarried in the years since we graduated.  These people all seem so foreign to me that I see myself going to that reunion and walking out twelve minutes later and rushing home to check my yearbook for my picture. “Yep. There I am. Class of ’95. Now who the heck were  those  people?”  I still talk to two (2) friends from high school regularly. High school was not at all a bad experience for me; I actually really enjoyed it (not that I’d want to relive it or anything). I wasn’t one of the “popular” girls in school, but I talked to everybody and had many friends, including a tight circle of close friends throughout. Where are  those  people? And if I see them again, will we have anything to talk about beyond the padded, superficial social resume that seems to automatically spill from people’s lips?  I have not yet made my presence known in this Class of ’95 group, and I don’t know that I will. Perhaps if I see a familiar, friendly name pop-up, I will feel compelled to say, “hello.” I may have made a mistake in joining this group at all. Watching all of this chatter is causing me to question even going to the reunion at all.  Go ‘Stros.

      It seems that a cold front has swept through the greater Houston area today, dropping temperatures as low as a nipply 88 degrees.    Brrrrr…is it Thanksgiving already?  Ok, alright, but 88 degrees is way better than the 100-degree days we’ve been having all week.  Heat indices have been hanging consistently around 120 and  that , friends, makes for one honkin’ bad hair week.  We’re expected to have a  gorgeous  weekend, though, which will be perfect for a birthday party.  And not just any birthday party –  urlLink Sara’s  birthday party!  Woot!  I really have made no other plans for the weekend.  I think the guy and I are going to hang out tonight, maybe get some dinner and go see a movie.

      Who’s with me on this show?  Anybody?  I have to say that I was sorry to see Tammy Pescatelli and Kathleen Madigan go last night, as I thought they both were way funnier than Gary Gulman and John Heffron.  I loved Jay London’s sense of humor, but after only the first couple of shows, his stuff just became more chuckle-funny than haha-funny.  His endearing one-liners and the quirkiness of his look began to wear, also.  I do think that the best comic remains in the top three, though:  Alonzo Boden.  His material has been solid week after week, and I picked him to win it all from the beginning.  I was really hoping to see Alonzo, Tammy, and Kathleen in the final three.  Gary Gulman just isn’t funny to me, and John, well, he doesn’t make me laugh either.  I’m predicting Alonzo Boden will be the Last Comic Standing in a landslide victory next week.  Who’s with me?  Go ‘Stros.

      City Kid:  “You’ve never heard of Reggae?!?” Amish Kid:  “Ray Gay?  Never heard of the dude…”  Well, I told you I was planning on watching again…  I am totally fascinated by this train wreck of a show.  More so for the insight into the Amish culture, albeit edited for content and greatly exaggerated and misrepresented for entertainment value by the network bozos, I’m sure.  But it’s fun to watch, nonetheless, even if I could do without the snotty, ridiculous “city kids.”  I mean, where did they  get  these people?  You have the one girl, Ariel, a vegan who claims that cows come from outer space and that eggs are “chicken abortions;” Nick, the ass from Boston (why do they only put jerky Bostonians on television?) who refused to volunteer at a community center for the mentally challenged with the rest of his housemates because he “wouldn’t be able to stop himself from laughing at them” (I told you he was an ass…); Whitney, the hand-waving, attitudy, inner-city girl; and three other kids that manage to piss me off only slightly less than the aforementioned three.  I do this all the time, you know – I watch these reality shows and realize that I hate everybody involved, only to tune in religiously just to gripe about the atrocity of it all.  So last night, our wacky Amish protagonists were exposed to a bus ride, a raucous argument with the city kids, pasta, “fajitos” and “enchilados,” volunteer work, gambling at the horse races, and their first-ever concert (who knew that Arrested Development was still touring?  By the way, the second concert I ever went to:  En Vogue, featuring Arresting Development…ha ha ha…).  I was relieved to see that the previews for next week’s episode show the Amish kids being exposed to the less glamorous sides of the city, with homelessness and a more normal living environment at Whitney’s house in South Central LA.  I mean, I realize that you and I live in houses with swimming pools on the roofs and mail that drops down a chute into our giant living rooms and bills that pay themselves, but I’d hate for these poor Amish kids to give up their Amish way of life thinking that they will be rock stars like us.  It just doesn’t work that way, mang.  Happy Thursday, Y’all…  Go’ Stros.

      Protocol requires that before an employee may return to work after a medical leave of absence, they must have the company nurse rubber-stamp a work release obtained from his/her physician. Upon clearance from the company nurse, said employee is granted permission to retrieve their badges, revoked upon leave, and is regranted database privileges, also revoked upon leave.  I hobbled into the headquarters building of my company and stood at the security desk, quietly explaining to the guard that I was returning to work after being on medical leave for over two weeks. I signed in and was granted a temporary badge that allowed me to walk, unescorted, through the building. I ambled gingerly on my tender foot back to the nurse’s office. The nurse, a largish woman, pleasant in blue scrub bottoms and busy-patterned scrub top, looked up at me and smiled, and without giving me a chance to offer an explanation for my presence before her, said, “Maternity leave?”  My left eyebrow involuntarily shot up over my head and landed on the table behind me. I realize that I spent two weeks creating a permanent dent on the couch in the shape of my rear end, but geez, woman, maternity leave?!? I have been accused of being thin, skinny, even scrawny, so I must say that “having recently given birth” is a new one on me. I shook my head and gave her my best no-way “UH-UHHH” and pointed down at my booted foot.  Thus began my first day back to work after my extended convalescence. That being said, I must tell you now that there is something to be said for having great coworkers. I walked into my office (my Pit of Despair) to find a “HELP WANTED” sign taped to my computer and a large handicap decal taped to my chair. Oh! And foot-shaped notepads! Foot-shaped notepads! Cracked me up…  I am so blessed to work with some of the sweetest, most thoughtful people ever. I cannot count the number of great big hugs and I-missed-yous and just general well-wishes that I received today, and even a prayer from our resident weekend-pastor. Not to mention all of the phone calls that I received daily, while I was away. Sweet, sweet people.  Not a bad Monday for having been deprived of sleep by an out-of-whack sleep-schedule brought on by two weeks of staying up late and sleeping in. 5am rolled around very early this morning, my friends.  How was your Monday?  Go ‘Stros.
