      So it is 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of?  The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right?  So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight. I think it is my new favorite show. Just hilarious. Quite crude at points, but still just hilarious. I think my roomates and friends are starting to love it too. We have vowed to stick with it weekly on Tuesdays.  Canada Day approaches on Thursday, which means a stat holiday and no work. This affords me the oppurtunity to go out on Wednesday night and sleep in the next day. I promised Jenny and her roomate that we could go out dancing at a club, cause neither of them have ever been clubbing before. I'm quite looking forward to it, and really can't wait to be dancing again. Hopefully it won't end up costing me too much.  Anyways, back to work then on to bed. Oh to dream..........  Shalom.

      Well it's the day after the election here in Canada. The Liberal Party has a minority government in place with the Conservative Party as the leader of the opposition. For those of you unfamilliar with the Canadian system of government, it is unique certainly, but not to complicated. Certainly not as complicated as that of our neighnours to the south. Man, I can't begin to understand how that works.  Life is busy for me at the moment. Working hard daily, fixing computers for friends in my evenings, and keeping very involved with my church. (Leading a musical worship team often, and ministering as a youth leader). Jenny and I find time for each other as much as possible, and I try and keep my social life balenced by hanging out with my roomates and friends as well.  Speaking of friends, I've come to some disturbing conclusions today whom I can count as such in the bunch of people I work with. For the second time in a row, I find myself purposefully not invited to a social gathering by the same young lady here at work. This young lady works in an affiliated department in my division, and as a division we are all relatively the same age and social standing. Thus we work as a division and play as a division. I have always gotten along well with this young lady (so I thought), yet for the 2nd time in the last couple of weeks (3rd in the last month or so) I find myself intentionally not part of the social activities she organizes. What a blow. I am certainly outgoing, and definately have the tendancy to be loud or even obnoxious at times, but I would like to say that in the end, I get along with everyone, and most certainly have no problems getting along with me. Still don't know the end result of all these feelings, but we shall see........  Oh the drama of it all, eh? *laugh*  Anyways, I will continue with the mediocrity of my existence for now, plot and scheme of how to obtain the finances I require for the next year in a short period of time, and try to continue to write about these things here. To any who decide to see this, peace and blessings.  Rooster

      So coming home from church this morning, I decide to use today as my day to work. I'm going to get my cell phone repaired (courtesy of Bell Mobility), do like 4 loads of laundry (I'm almost completely out of clothes) clean my room and then head back to the house that I am house sitting. Don't know why, I just feel motivated to do stuff rather than sit around and read, or play video games.  Tomorrow is federal election day here in Canada. I plan on voting conservative of course. I was thinking about this recently and realized how odd it is that an extremely artsy person like me, who is so in to personal freedom and epotimizes a new generation of thinking in so many ways is only comfortable with traditional Judeo-Christian family valess (like those represented by our federal conservatives). Meh. Who knows.  Anyways, off to take in the world in a series of small chores and need-to-do errands. With any luck I will find bundles of cash on the street somewhere, and no longer be poor. *laugh*  Shalom.

      Well, I am new to blogging, and let me tell you that a week in the real world goes by fast. It's been since last Friday since I have recorded my thoughts onto this page that no one reads.  This week has been one of ups and down. Got screwed over by my potential insurance company when applying for the auto insurance for the car I recently came into possession of. They quoted me one price, assuming I had taken a driver's training course as a teenager, which of course was the wrong assumption. Upon my attempt to seal the deal with the company, they realised the error of their ways and demanded more money from me in order for me to get insured. I can't afford to pay them more than what they were initially asking. Long story short is that I am poor, have no insurance, thus no plates, thus my car remains parked in the underground parking facility beneath my apartment.  On a happier note, it's time I did something important. Let me introduce the world to the woman I love. Her name is Jennifer (Jenny for short) Gay. Yes her last name is Gay. Insert joke here. I've known this young lady for near to 10 years as her father was the former pastor of the church I regularily attended growing up in Peterborough, Ontario. This lady has been a dear friend for about a year, and an intense friend that my heart beats for passion with since late January of this year (2004). Well, our blooming friendship has progressed to the point where I believe that she is the woman I am to marry. (This is not just some flight of fancy, but being a deeply religious man, I believe that this is divine revelation to me) So I love Jenny and she loves me. We want to marry each other and shall some day. However, as in any good relationship we have our ups and downs. So last night was a night that started as a down and moved to an up. I was upset about the insurance thing getting screwed up. She was moody and cranky cause I was across town housesitting (forgoing any social connection with her for the next few days) combined with (dare I say) a little PMS. We talked on the phone for long hours into the night, and the result was that we both lightened each other's loads. Jenny felt her fears of my actions representing apathy / or poor treatment towards her in our relationship slip away, and my day / night was brightened by the action of reaffirming my love to my love. I can easily say that God has His hand in our life, 'cause only he can facilitate communication like that.  So all is well in the land of Rooster and Jenny (although the Rooster continues to rave at all car insurance companies and brokers) and life moves on as always.  I resolve to blog more often, but also realize in all reality that it's a discipline that needs to be honed. So here's to hoping that I hone it sooner rather than later. At this point in time, it certainly makes no difference as no one reads this blog, but perhaps, just perhaps one day, someone will run their mouse through my archives and explore the inner workings of my mind. Now, as to the meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything......  Rooster

      So another week has come to an end. I am sooooooo glad. I am exhausted. Have had a very physically and emotionally tiring week. It will be nice to have a weekend of relaxation and rest.  I work in an IT department, so really it is quite amazing that I am just starting to blog now. Isn't that the stereotype? That as a geek my entire life is online somewhere? *S*  Hoping to post tonight. We will see. Love and peace.  Rooster

      So if you haven't visited this site and watched this parody yet, you must have been living under a rock for the last week.    urlLink Funny americans at JibJab.com   Though apparently as of recently, these fine young upstanding gents are facing a cease and desist, not from the politicians that they are poking fun at, but from the company who is mad for their alleged "breach of copyright".   urlLink Read about it here   So this brings me to a pet peeve of mine. Digital media copyright enactment. So many people are uninformed and misled by the popular media about this topic. It's even stereotypical to hear comments like "file sharing is wrong" or "isn't that illeagal?" And after the most recent rounds of RIAA bullying the common consumer and internet user, people just get the wrong perceptions altogether about things like MP3s, DIVX and XVID versions of Hollywood feature flicks, copied PC software, etc.  You want to know my viewpoints? Then ask me!  imtherooster@gmail.com  Rooster

      Does it ever seem to you like you can never get ahead? My job pays well enough, and I live cheap enough, but I can never make enough money it seems. I am frugal and even keep a good budget, but I will still be short when it comes to tuition in the fall. (Less alone getting my car on the road)  Work, work, work, and for what?  Now that is the question isn't it?  Rooster

      So a whole weekend passes without me posting. That feels a little odd, as I have become accustomed to posting almost daily. But I had a busy weekend, so I suppose I shall not be too hard on myself. ;-)  Saturday included sleeping in, eating a massive breakfast, working out and playing worship on church. Sunday was church again, a 15k bike ride, an 8k hike up a mountainside, some reading and finally sleep.  I've felt out of time at the end of each day lately, and I think it's cause everyday of mine is so full. Maybe I need a holiday. *laugh* Too bad I can't afford to take one. Yay for the life of a student.  Finally, if you are a fan of politics, political humour or if you are American, i would sugget you check out this little  urlLink cartoon . One of the funniest things I have seen on the internet since the  urlLink Ghyslain the Star Wars Kid  was passed around a few years ago.  Anyways, I don't know when I will get a chance to actually post this musing, as my computer is running a virus check and port scan right now, so hitting other internet sites may be unadvisable. Perhaps I will throw it up when I get to work. Shalom all.  Rooster

      Ever have a morning where you wish that you could stay in bed? Where you wish you could hit snooze one more time? (Or in my case, that you could reach the cell phone that you use as an alarm clock a little quicker to shut it up!) Ever get so busy in life that you just want some down time when none is in sight in the forseeable future?  Just wondering.  It's a friday, so I can't complain really. Half day at the office, evening off from my extra-curriculars, and a chance to sleep in tomorrow if my body will allow it. Rather jam-packed weekend aside from that. Church, hiking, weiner-roast, etc. but I guess that's alright.  Maybe this morning is not even a bad thing, right? Building discipline, maintaining a schedule, budgeting finances and time and all that........  Still, I wish I could just float for a month or two, or (glory of glories!) a year. Does anyone else ever think how great it could be if someone would just carry us for a while. So you don't have to worry about schedules, and budgets, and whatever? If you could just do as you please for a small amount of time? *smile* Maybe that would be nice. Then again, what would that make me into at then end of all things? I guess I'm thankful for early mornings in the end. Even if I don't like them at the moment. It's still another day, and I have the air to breath and a roof over my head. Can't be sour about that!

      So 35 years ago now, mankind first landed on the moon.   urlLink Read about it here   35 years ago people around the world, specifically concentrated in the USA, were watching as Bazz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in the Eagle. Phrases such as "The Eagle has landed" and "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" were embedded into popular culture and folklore, and it was proclaimed that a new age was born. As with any event of this magnitude, there was controversy a-plenty to accompany. For years, left-wing extremists accused the government of the United States of abandoning domestic problems to sink resources into the space program, while right-wing extremists took hold of that same issue but claimed money would have been better used arming soldiers in Vietnam. Conspiracy theorists would grab hold of this moment and find their theories of government manipulation of the masses vindicated (at least in their own minds) by claiming the whole event was staged and televised in a New Mexico desert. What one generation will remember as a whole though is watching in utter awe the unification (in general) of a nation behind one dream, one goal.  Where is that unification now? What did landing a man (or men) on the moon attain for us in the long run?  In related news, Joe Schmoe 2 was the most entertaining thing on television tonight.  Shalom.  Rooster

      So 2 weeks ago my Papa (grandfather on my dad's side) fell at our family land and cottages in western Quebec and broke his hip. On his stay at the hospital much more was discovered than the most astute way to heal and rehabilitate his fractured hip. Apparently Papa has had a series of small strokes over the last while and is suffering from Parkinson's disease in his twighlight years. This is compounded by his diabetes which he has suffered from for all of his life.  Now here is the dilemma I face. I live almost 4000 kms away from my Papa, and see him as often as I can, but certainly not as often as I would like. So how do I engage with him even more now and make the most out of the decreasing time that we have left together?  How do I express my faith to him in a way that moves him and touches his heart? How do I support my family (mom, dad, brothers and sister) while being so far away from them? Do I start to engage in the fact that Papa could die soon or is that fatalistic? Is it even realistic to expect death soon when I believe and live for a God who does miracles? So many unanswered questions.  I've spent the last 4 days with the family of my beloved Jenny. It's been an intense experience for me as their family is so different from my own. Her dad is a pastor and someone I have always looked up to as a mentor in my own life. For 10 years I have known Pastor Rick and his family as role models and beloved people to me. I look at the way he and his wife interact as my example (not solely, but primarily) as a healthy example of marriage. They interact with me and their own children in a way that is so foreign to me that I find it envigorating and frustrating all at the same time. They (we) do things together as a family and this concept speaks volumes to me, and makes me extremely uncomfortable as well. I was raised by wonderful parents, but we didn't spend hours at a time sitting together, playing together, eating together, walking together. All these different perspectives on family have influenced my thought on my particular familial situation at the moment too.  I think of potentially the times that could have been if my family spent the time together that the Rick, Jan, Randy, Bryan and Jenny do. At the same time my family can have a hard enough time getting along without a lot of added time together. I don't know really. I'm not drawing all these circumstances and events into one conclusive thought really at this moment, just reflecting on the actuallity of the events. Using my blog as a sounding board as it were.  So what to do? Well I suppose I will do what I always do. Live life. Love the best I can all those around me. Trust that God is sovereign and ever seek to let Him do His work in my life as I live on. My life will change (eg. as it has with the recent "family visits" and the Papa situation) and my life will continue as long as God sees fit, so spending that life in His presence seems like as good as it could ever possibly be, all bad news aside.  Shalom.  Rooster

      This morning I sat in a church service at Central United church. This is a congregation made up of many different elements that worships together weekly in a downtown facility here in Calgary. This is not something new to me. I attend worship services regularily at my own church (Bow Valley Alliance) and as a matter of fact since engaging in my Theology degree, I could even make justification for a statement saying that I am even over-churched. I have been to countless different services in different traditions, and being brought up in an evangelical Christian subculture, have had even more exposure to various "christian" atmospheres growing up. Yet I found this morning unique for two reasons.  The first was the socio-cultural makeup of the congregation. It was a mix of church-goers who were most likely very comfortable with traditional United services which are usually ecumenical in nature (which means it feel liks a "high church" with scripted readings, creedal recitations, corporate prayer, etc.) along with people who inhabit this particular area of downtown Calgary. Now this particular area of downtown Calgary is inhabited mostly by the homeless, and various types of social miscreants (drug dealers, prostitutes, and ladies and gentlemen who openly and actively engage in the homosexual sub-culture here in the city). What this cultural mixing displayed to me led to the second unique thing I saw: A true demonstration of love.  Pastor Rick Gay (insert joke about the last name here) observed to me this morning that in comparison to the service we attended last night at Bow Valley there were similarities and differences. The similarity was primarily that the spirit of God was present and moving at both services. The difference would be in the way people expressed themselves and that was most amply demonstrated by the loving attitude prevelant in the unique cultural mixing. It is out of the every day norm to see an older united church lady sitting next to a prostitute or a transsexual. It is even more out of the every day norm to watch them share coffee and hug each other after a church service.  I can't say that this experience is a shocker for me, or is something I've missed out on having done some previous work with inner city ministries and outreach to homeless and other socio-cultural groups, but it sure was refreshing to see love poured out like that. I walked away thinking how good it would probably be for the common, average middle-class attendees of my church to go down and visit Central United for a Sunday morning service. I wonder if they would simply walk away thinking, or if they would walk away moved to demonstrate love in a different or new manner. I also walked away thinking the same thoughts as applied to myself. For me, this morning, downtown was definately where it was at....  Rooster

      So the advertising emphasis of this year's Calgary Stampede has been "Calgary: The Capitol of the New West". I suppose this is supposed to appeal to the traditional attendees of the stampede by bringing back mental imagery of the old west, or the wild west or whatever, while appealing to a newer, younger, hipper audience by adding the word "new" to the title. (Honestly, it's amazing what one word can do to our perception of something!) While I was standing in line for Ralph Klein's stampede breakfast on Monday, my boss made an incredibly astute statement that has stuck with me through this week of cowboy madness in my current city of residence. Kirk (my boss) said that "six-shooters had been replaced with cell phones and PDAs as the weapon of choice in the new west". Wow. How true that is. We no longer need to take lives and kill to settle our disputes and quarrells, now we buy and sell and merge and deal and dally and whatever else. However the final effect is the same. Lives are changed for better or for worse and people either prosper or suffer. Perhaps this west isn't so "new" after all...  So in the following few days, aside from my bout with some sort of cold, (which I am now firmly convinced was brought to me by my roomate who works as a shipper/receiver for a furniture company. Yes I am totally certain he imported some form of rare virus to my bedroom) I have been observing the going-ons of Calgary during this, my second, stampede.  Stampede breakfasts are the event of choice to participate in for most. For the uninitiated, a stampede breakfast (or lunch in some cases) occurs when a business or service decide to host either a public or private meal for everyone to come and have food and fellowship at. Breakfasts traditionally cater pancakes (among other breakfast staples like sausages, etc.) and lunches usually entail some sort of dead animal on a BBQ. (Preferably beef or pork so I've been told) Having attended 4 stampede breakfasts this week, I'm constantly amazed at the willingness and good intentions of local (and international) companies in Calgary and the effort and obvious money put into giving people free food, just 'cause it is Stampede week. This morning I went to the breakfast hosted by Shell Inc. (the oil/gas company) and there were no less than 2000 people there being cattled through lines at fully catered breakfast tables. Country music being D.J.ed and even bales of straw to sit on. I have never seen another city (for a week and a half at a time no less) willing to divert from routine for one event. Roads closed, businesses shut or on odd hours, and people willing just to do anything to get involved with the stampede. There is a window-painting business here in town that does nothing but paint temporary murals on store-front windows. I spoke to an employee there, and apparently 96% of their business comes during the stampede. They paint murals of cowboys and horses and the such in large business windows, and practically go on holidays for the rest of the year. And they make PHENOMINAL cash doing it too. I'm talking like $50,000 a year for a grunt with an airbrush and a stencil that only works 1 day a week aside from the month prior to stampede.  All this to say that I am discovering more and more each day that I live in an extremely unique city, at a point in time where it is nothing but advantageous for me to be in Calgary. I've caught myself calling this city home from time to time too. Although part of me will always reside in my home province of British Colombia, and an even larger part of me in Ontario where I was raised for the majority of my life, Alberta is starting to look something I can say is a piece of me as well.  Shalom

      In the news this morning is a story of a tourist who bought a suitcase at a flea market in Australia for the price of $36. This seems like a bit of a rip-off for a tattered, flea market suitcase. Apparently though, upon examinining the contents of this suitcase the buyer assured himself that he had procured a rather good deal.  The suitcase contained a treasure trove of The Beatles' memoriabilia inculding original photos, concert programs and previously unreleased recordings and mixes of songs off of Abbey Road. Speculators think that this was the luggage of a former Beatles roadie and sound-tech that was killed by police for brandishing a fake firearm.  I could only imagine. Everyone examines flea markets looking for good deals, looking to fulfil small needs, real or imaginary and to stock their homes full of treasures that have all but been cast off by the seller or the original owner. Whether this tourist was simply looking for some luggage to take home some memories from down under or whether this was a buyer who was quite happy to land on the reciprical side of the age-old addage "caveat emptor", this tourist scored a treasure of high value at this little Australian flea-market. I hope that this tourist deems it prudent to place these treasures in a position that makes them accessible to the ever-marching veritable army of Beatle-maniacs that still walk the earth, rather than simply sell them to the highest bidder (although the two ends there could very well be in the same person).  One can only hope that in the future more sleeper-treasures will continue to be unearther in regards to musical legends.  Speaking of sleepers.....  Between the hours of 8pm on Tuesday July 13th and 8am Wednesday July 14th I slept 10 hours in total. Now this may seem unimpressive to the average person, but if you know me in the flesh, you realize that an amount of sleep like that lies somewhere in the realm of miraculous. I generally sleep between 3 and 6 hours a night (and have done so for many years) and experiencing that much sleep has thrown my body for a bit of a loop. Although I'm sure it is related to the head cold I'm battling through, it is still a little disconcerting to know that my body can take over my regular habits and patterns of living and make me a slave to it's desires.  I'm taking a full day off of work today to return myself to tip top condition and further enable myself to resume my professional and personal responsibilities on the morrow. This also gives me 8 extra hours of time while I rest today to occupy myself. Not being a fan of daytime television, this gives me the oppurtunity to clean my apartment, get some laundry done and perhaps work on the computer a little towards some projects and hobbies I have had on the back-burner for a while.   For the dozen or so of you who have already submitted your pics to the blog for the advertising contest, I know I told you they would be up on Monday or Tuesday. I want to beg your forgiveness, and reassure you that you will see them up and going by the end of the week. This cold took the wind out of my sails a little and I seem not to have the energy or concentration to do much.  So to all I wish a great day and shalom unending.  Rooster

      So today marks my 2nd day at work this week where I will be doing some good ol' fashion manual labour rather than IT related tasks. This is a good thing. I've always enjoyed working with my hands, and although it it simply disassembling and reassembling furniture and the such, I find such diversions envigorating from time to time. On the other hand, I would find this diversion much more envigorating if I wasn't sick today.  That's right, it seems I have woken up this morning in the midst of a phenominal head cold. Knew it was coming to some degree, but that doesn't excuse the inconvenience, nor pardon it's intrusion into my life. I have beeen so sick this last year since moving to calgary. In the 5 years prior to moving to calgary, I may have been sick a grand total of 3 times. In this last year though, easily 6 or 7 times now I've been incapacitated from my everyday activities by either head or chest colds, or stomach viruses or something of the sort. Honestly I don't get why, but I must conclude that it has something to do with the environment which I reside in. Either the apartments I live in make me sick, or it's the city itself. The air is much dryer out here than anything I've been used to before (I was born in the lower mainland of B.C. and grew up in humid and wet south-eastern Ontario) and I think it's possible that this contributes to my condition.  Still, it's infuriating to have a city so beautiful make you so miserable.  If this keeps up, I'm going to have to take off time from work. I can barely see, and my nose is threatening to drip onto my shirt.  Dirty praries, and dumb mountains. Bah.  Rooster

      Each year, thousands of athletes around the globe train vigorously to keep their bodies in peak physical condition so they can (or at least attempt to) attain and maintain dominance in their sport of choice, whether that sport be team based or personal. With the upcoming Summer Olympic Games in Greece this year, I recently took a moment to reflect on this fact and wonder.  Now the moment I took to reflect on this fact was at 7:00am on my Sunday morning. You see at 7:00am this morning I was awakened by over 6000 people standing outside my apartment building for the watching of, and/or participating in the event known as the Calgary Marathon. The bozo who organized this event thought that it would be prudent to start their course and set up their sound booth and speakers DIRECTLY in front of my building, beneath my 3rd floor balcony no less. So with sappy music blaring (aside from the starting moment where Yanni's "Chariots of Fire" supplimented the sappy music) and a single-barrel 12-gauge shotgun used as the starting instrument rather than a starting pistol, 6000 people screamed, cheered, and congregated in front of the building where I was trying to sleep.  You can only imagine, during this moment, the particular types of reflection that I was doing in my mind on the physcological stability and social ineptability of athletes, professional or ameteur, and how they interact on the culture around them.  All that being said....I'm going to try and get some more sleep.  Shalom.

      And they're off! Today was the official beginning of the Calgary Stampede here in Cow Town, the capitol of the New West as it were. As so at the beggining of every stampede, the Calgary Stampede Parade kicked off the festivities this morning. Now if you are not a native Calgarian, or have no child hood memories to feel all warm and fuzzy about, most would find the parade rather boring. Lots of horses and wagons, wannabe cowboys shooting blanks from their guns, and some local quality floats. Nothing really compared to the Toronto Santa Claus Parade, or the Macey's (sp?) Thanksgiving Parade in NYC. But the thing that sets the stampede and it's respective parade apart is the excitement in the air in the city. Every local business and even the guber-national corporate towers are decorated for the stampede. The usual suit and ties are replaced by Wranglers and cowboy hats, and there are Stampede Breakfasts given out for free everyday by someone different. At night, for those so inclined, the bars, pubs and clubs go nuts with country themes, live performances and special events. All this for a Conklin Fair built around a livestock show and a week-long rodeo. They even gave me the day off of work to "watch the parade". Not too shabby.  So on my day off I fixed a friends laptop, and played a video game or two. Well, that is really just a figure of speech I suppose as really I only played one game. Final Fantasy XI of course, my current obsession. *laugh*  This promises to be a relaxing weekend, and I can't wait to see it through.  BTW did you know that a flock of geese is called a gaggle?

      So there is a technology consortium known as SEO and it recently held a competition to see what website could get the highest rating on Google. This was done by making up a word. "nigritude ultramarine" was the word invented. This consortium invited web denizens everywhere to use the "best search engine enhancement" that they could in order to get the highest spot on Google's search; eg. when you type in "nigritude ultramarine" on Google, you want to be the first website listed. Apparently there is a huge market out there for people who "optimize" your website to be more search engine friendly.  Well the gent who won the contest for the month of July is none other than Anil Dash. Anil lives in NYC and is a famous blogger and online media mogul-type. All he did to win is ask the people who read his blog to link to his page with a link on their sites that read "nigritude ultramarine". *laugh* How simple was that? Other people reprogrammed quads of HTML and virtual scripts, and all to be beaten by a blogger and his fans.  This brings me to two topics. Advertising and consumer capitolism. We live in an age where the almighty dollar rule western society (meaning North America, western europe, and any other post-industrial-non-socialist states). In order to survive the battleground of corporations vying for your hard earned case, you have to understand the methods said corporations use to obtain that cash from your wallet. Their primary weapon is advertising. Whomever has the best advertising wins. If you are old enough, you will most likely remember a time when Reebok was a much more trusted brand for sports products above any other. Or Adidas before that. But in the mid to late 1980s that change. Nike signed an endorsement contract with a basketball superstar named Michael Jordon. Now Nike sits upon a throne in the sports marketing industry that is unlikely to topple to any usurper due to the prestige marketing has brought them ever since. Another example aside from prestige is memorability. How many of you can hum the original McDonalds jingle that was on TV and radio for almost 40 years? How about the new McDonalds jingle "lovin' it"? (The new jingle by the way was written by Justin Timberlake for the fast food chain) Think of how familliar you are with jingles or ads off the TV ("zoom, zoom" for Mazda, the "NBC" tones for the TV network, etc.) and compare that with your familiarity with cultured things or even popular things. (eg. The latest top 40 music list, or famous musicals, operas or symphonies) Advertising is most likely one of the most powerful forces in your life. So is it really a surprise that kids these days want the latest $300 Nike runners, or need $400 for a PS2 and all the trimmings just so they can hear that cool sony "vvvvmmmmm" sound when they start their game console up? Advertising = mass choice in our common social structure (that is capitol consumerism).  On that note, I have received my first official entries to my advertising competition. Keep the photos coming everyone. In case you missed my last entry, I'm looking for digital pictures of you (or your family and friends) holding up a clearly readable sign that reads "Rooster's Blog". I'm looking for photos of all types. Funny, intense, creative, sexy, etc. Most importantly I want the photos to grab people's attention. I will be using them for advertising and the best entries will end up on the web.  So no holds barred, send in your pictures to imtherooster@gmail.com and get your post on the blog. Happy picture-taking.  Rooster

      So my contests and advertising campaign for this blog has started. I have some links going up soon, but most importantly the homemade picture advertisements are coming.  I have friends promising to hold up signs with "Roosters Blog" written on them. I'm expecting some phenomenal ones in from my a group out of south-western Ontario by Friday. As a thank you to them, I will be putting up a post dedicated to the organizer of this little group, an old friend of mine, Cheryl Bechtold.  On this note, if you are here and would like to get involved, I have a request for all my readers: I want your digital pics of you (or whomever) holding a sign that says "Rooster's Blog" on it (body art is also acceptable) and the picture must be one that I can use to advertise the site. So be creative!  I've been keeping track of my daily hits, and I want to see if this contest and the photos that follow influence traffic. Email pictures and questions about the contest to imtherooster@gmail.com  Looking forward to seeing your entries!  Rooster

      So I am now the proud owner of 2 gmail accounts. (I think I have also found a way to make myself unlimited accounts. Gonna try that later) I don't see what all the fuss is about. I don't even know that I like the interface that much, and although the "search" bit of the program certainly seems clever, it can be annoying too. Wish I could turn it off. Still. I have the 2 gmail addresses that I really want reserved for me, and me alone. That's gotta be something right?  As usual, people were just about desperate to display their power, and by surfing and posting on www.gmailswap.com I managed to get one bozo to email me an invite for nothing whatsoever, and actually found out that one of my coworkers had invites, and I ended up with another account via him.  So can you believe it? The hottest invite on the net and in the space of one morning, I score two? Maybe I'm right. Maybe an invite is just not something to fuss about. *laugh*  Then again, it could end up revolutionizing Life, The Universe and Everything...  Rooster.

      So Google's massive free online email service is still in the beta phase. So to receive an account, you must be invited by someone already enlisted in the program. Of course, living in the capitolistic society that we do, there is a website that advertises for people to swap items for an invite to the magic email accounts. I understand the appeal. 1GB email storage with 10MB attachments is unheard of in the free email world, and for the computer literate, a definate boon.  Needless to say I have shamelessly taken advantage of www.gmailswap.com and posted many lucrative sounding offers to see what kind of response I could get. It took 5 mins. Only 5 mins to get my first invite. Not bad, eh?  Anyways, I will let you all know the final outcome, and whether or not I end up with a gmail account. This should be fun. At the very least it is an interruption from my everyday routine. *laugh*  Shalom.

      So after viewing the big-budget summer blockbuster Spiderman 2, I walked away impressed, yet somehow unsatisfied. Yes the movie was good. It had a reasonable plot for a superhero flick, stunning visuals, majestic music (props to Danny Elfman yet again) and far better than expected character development (a well done acting job by Toby Maguire). Yes the movie even surpassed the first as far as movie enjoyment goes. Yet somehow I still felt like I missed out on something. I think if it was anyother movie, I would have called it a great movie, but because this blockbuster is set to break almost every box office record for initial release, and probably has a shot at sitting high on the top-10 grossing films of all-times list (at least for now) I think I was expecting something more. Come to think of it, I felt the same way after the first Spiderman movie as well, around similar circumstances to it's release no less. So the question of the hour is: Did this movie deliver? Well, as great a movie as it may or may not have been, I think I was justified spending my $8 to see it (plus $4 for a drink), though I just think a movie this widely accepted should give me something more. I walked away like I had just seen the 2nd part of a trilogy (eg. The Two Towers, or The Empire Strikes Back) resigned to the fact that a year or two from now, I must spend another exhorbant amount of money in a theatre to see the next piece of this drama. Well perhaps that is what this movie was designed to do in the end. Perhaps this is more a commentary with my emotions linked to it speaking to the design of Hollywood to generate revenue rather than to truly entertain and fulfill. Or perhaps this really says that entertainment can ultimately never be fulfilling...... oooooohh...... That's deep! *laugh*  So on Sunday night after an odd set of circumstances at my church, and a rather envigorating sermon on sex (that broke the mold of church-types preaching and railing against sex as a dirty thing of the world) my lady and I engaged in some swing dance lessons. Oh my! Now I can dance per se, but I have never tried "real" dances with complicated steps (eg. swing, tango, cha-cha, etc). I can waltz, line dance and club to my heart's content, but this was something new to me. The 1-hour lesson went rather well, and then the floor was "open" for another couple of hours as the instructors filtered through music of various sorts in order for their students to practice their newly learnt steps. Well aside from one nasty incident of stepping on my partner's toes, the whole night was somewhat enjoyable, rather unique, and seemed to bring no end of delight to Jenny. Though I don't think I will become a dancer of any sort, now or ever, it remains to be seen if this is an activity that I can repeat from time to time just to break the monotony of my regular routine if anything.  Upon return, I had a quick bite, thanked my dear lady for working diligently to provide me with clean laundry, and tried to head to bed to be well rested for the morning. I had a great sleep I'm sure, and much longer than usual for me, but as had been the case for the last 4 mornings, I woke up totally exhausted and wanting to sleep more. As a matter of fact, today I did sleep more, and re-wokeup just 15 mins before I had to be in the office. Oy! Don't know what frustrated me more. The breaking of my morning routine, or the inability to shower properly before work. (I hate feeling dirty or grimy) Thus my evening is undoubtably going to contain a nice shower, some light cleaning at home, and hopefully some indulgence in my favorite video game at this point in time, which of course is none other than FFXI. (Final Fantasy XI for those of you uninitiated into the world of SquareSoft Inc.)  So upon reflection of my weekend, I find myself in an odd mood. Not that it was good, not that it was bad, not that it was empty, not that it was full. It was just unique. I look forward to having a bit more free time than usual this week (having no commitments other than being a youth sponsor with the youth group on wednesday) so perhaps my week upcoming will benefit. Although, I've been told idle hands are the devil's tools.....  Rooster

      Well Canada Day left me feeling about as patriotic as a blustering jihad warrior entrapped in an FBI training facility. Meaning of course to say that I don't feel patriotic at all. I didn't celebrate the holiday of the birthing of my nation, paint my face red, or even proceed to the top floor of my apartment building with the other residents in order to catch a glimpse of the fireworks being launched from the Canadian Olympic Park that lies just a little distance to the west of me. Instead I partied the night before at a cool little club downtown (and did cheer in the rolling over to midnight as a matter of fact, midnight of course signifying Canada Day) then I slept in, cleaned my apartment and played my current video game of choice (Final Fantasy XI). With this quasi-anti-patriotic churning down in the bowels of my very existence, I find myself waiting for the end of my work day so I can celebrate something else this weekend.  I'm ready to celebrate the summer.  Being a student, and someone who is involved in various aspects of life (my church, my friends, my job) I find between September and April to be ridiculously busy. No free time, and if I squeeze some personal time in somewhere, it is because I am putting something else off. Well from May to August that is different. Aside from working 8 hours a day, and a night or so a week with my youth group or my worship team, I am largely commitment free. That means tonight, as I go out to BBQ and hottub, I can do so guilt and worry free. I will come home, stay up late watching a movie perhaps, then pass my saturday away playing video games or something.  Ain't life grand?  Shalom.  Rooster

      So I've been playing Doom3 a bit lately and been quite impressed. It's quite the bit of entertainment. Video games just don't hold my attention like they used to. I sold my XBOX this summer as well, and aside from my periodic stints with FFXI and now Doom3, I really couldn't be bothered with video games. Not that I don't still find them entertaining, it's just that they aren't as good as they used to be (the developed games that is) and if I devote too much time to playing them, I feel guilty cause I have so many other things going on in my life.  Speaking of other things, my biological father is coming down to visit this weekend. He's stopping through Calgary on his vacaation here in Alberta. It's going to be great to see him (as I haven't spent significant time with him since October 2002 and haven't even seen him since May 2003). He's just here for a night, so we will probably go out for dinner and chill afterwards. Maybe have brunch the next day or something. I'm looking forward to introducing my dad to Jenny. I hope they hit it off. I know he wasn't too fond of my ex. (With good reason I suppose in retrospect)  Isn't it odd how we can worry about the interactions that go on between the people that have us as the mutual relationship? Person A and Person B only know each other because of you (Person C). I will refrain from approximating equasions at this point in order to draw the conclusions that you (the reader) are more than capable of ascertaining without such analogies.  Anywho, one more computer to do tonight, and I am done my mad spree of favours. Since last Friday, I have built 4 brand new computers from scratch, repaired 3 and upgraded 2. Lot's of work, but it's worth it to know that my friends and colleagues aren't going to get ripped off by "the man" when obtaining their computer products and services. *laugh* Oh man. Just read that sentance 5 times in a row. I am such a geek.  Anyways, if you pray, keep my friends Melissa and Angela in your prayers right now. Both are going through their own experiences and in the process of going through them, God has to lead them through some hard places. I'm praying for them, but it can't hurt to throw one or two more prayers out there, eh?  Love and peace everyone.  Rooster

      3 days since my last post? Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!! Why am I so busy? This is supposed to be summer, when I have no commitments and all sorts of free time! Since getting back from Summerland after the long weekend around the first of the month, it seems like I've had no time to myself. I run straight home after work, work some more, then either go to church or out to some pressing engagement that I have.  Not that I am complaining. No real stress involved or anything. I'm just getting tired.  Anyways, I have more plans this weekend believe it or not. I have family from BC coming to see me for a night. Don't know what we are gonna do yet. Something fun I hope.  So my love Jenny has determined that she is going to try and buy me a gift. I don't know why, and she can't really explain why to me either. She just wants to do it. What's more, she wants to buy me an expensive gift. I really don't want her to. People don't buy me expensive gifts, and this is an odd sensation, but she is determined. Not that I don't love her, or want to stifle her love for me, or don't appreciate the thought and feeling she has put into this expression, but I just have a problem with people spending large amounts of money on me. I don't know really.  I guess this is the power of a blog. I can express it, and articulate my thoughts in a way that may someday help me understand. (Not to mention the record kept of these things)  Ramble, ramble, ramble...........  Anyways. More work calls.  Shalom.

      So I spent most of my Friday night and half my Saturday so far working on computers. Building new ones, switching cases, upgrading old ones. Only none of it was for me. *laugh*  There is something so great about spending other people's money, but at the same time, when I have all these cool new computers sitting in my living room, it's hard to think about how I don't get to keep them.  Built 2 brand new computers for professors at the university/college I work at last night, upgraded the machine my Jenny's brother owns and am about to repair my roomates machine.  No profit or anything, just something nice to do for the people in my life, so they can save a few bucks.  Keeps me out of trouble I suppose too. *laugh* Besides, I will enjoy the look on their faces when they see their new computers. People generally like new toys and gizmos, so this should give them all something to be happy about at the very least.  Church tonight and tomorrow morning. Singing my heart out as usual. Then tomorrow is a special day for Jenny and I. 6 months since we mutually expressed our feelings and desires to move beyond plutonic friendship. *smile* Jenny is excited. That REALLY makes me happy. I love her so much some days it hurts.  Lots more going on really, but I don't feel too expressive right now. Meh.  Shalom.  Rooster

      So after a 6 day haitus I'm back and find that I don't necessarily have a lot to say, though what I will say should be worth your reading.  I spent the weekend out west, and that was more than satisfying. The town of Summerland in the Okanogan Valley was hot and tourist filled, as I personally discovered. Good times on the lake, and too much food (thanks to my hosts) made for an enjoyed visit, if not rushed.  Coming back to the booming metropolis of Calgary, I found the temperature 15 degrees lower, and that I felt rushed and harried in all aspects of my life. Needed to get this done, had to work on this, have this coming up, etc.  With impending deadlines and pressures building, I've found myself neglecting some of my more standardized daily disciplines, and have set today as a starting point to reorder my time and get those disciplines back on track.  I have been occupied by worry a little as of late too, which is odd for me, as I am definately not a worry-wort. I have a friend in Mississauga who is trying to get her life together, and while I offer her all the encouragement and help I can, I worry for her and the outcome of her efforts.  I have another friend who has had a tough couple of years (in the previous 2) and is returning to school this coming september. I worry for her, and pray for her, but am feeling more and more unsettled about her situation as time goes on.  Finally I worry about myself. I worry that one day I won't live up to all the things I need to. That I won't be there for the people who depend on me, or I won't be able to give all that I need to, or come up with the finances I must find time and time again, etc.  I guess I'm just a little short on peace lately. If you have a little to spare, drop me a line.  Rooster
