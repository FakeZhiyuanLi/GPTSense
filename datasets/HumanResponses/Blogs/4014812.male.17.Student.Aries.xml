      ARGH INDEED.... Well today me and James were suppose to go swimming.. but he was too lazy to pedal his ass over here... so we just kinda stayed home.  Then ashley phoned me and threatned me to goto a movie.. but i didnt want to cuz i didnt have a ride home... and i really didnt wanna take a taxi because they are really expensive and i dont exactly have alot of money to use this weekend so i must use sparingly...     Yeah.. me, Wes and James played Warcraft for like 2 hours straight... until about this point where im typing up this thingy... yeah.. we were playing this Diablo RPG thing and the players were being gay and using stupid moves, but i dont think you wanna hear about that.     yeah.. going downtown tomorrow apparently but i dunno what for.. or when.. cuz wes never gives complete instructions... DAMN YOU WES... YOU N YOUR GENGER BREAD MAN... hahaha Wes cant spell..

Bush... and that im  Slutty.... lol... news to me!    LOL... besides all the questions things it was a fairly borng day... I didnt do anything at all. Just kinda sat around all day and chatted to the very limited amount of people that actually talked to me.    I also cleaned up my contact list a bit... I deleted all the people that dont talk to me... or that do talk to me... just never... and when i try to talk to them they just kinda run away... (audra)... but i didnt delete her... cuz i wouldnt do such a thing... but yeah... i deleted just useless people from my list cuz they are boring and they dont deserve to be on my list anymore :D    Anyway... my parents are still going away this weekend and im looking for something todo... so if anyone wants to do somethign this weekend just ask me or something and we can get something organized or something and we can hang out:D    OH YEAH... im eatting a fudgesicle... hmmmmmmm

      Well... today i got called back from the Art Institute in Burnaby about their programs that i am looking forward to going into. But i havent recieved the stuff they sent me yet so i guess they are gonna call me back in like a couple days or so, so we can go over the courses and stuff.     Also today i told my grandparents that i wont be making it to Calgary this summer due to much difficultys in the past couple of days. Stupid Christians work and lack of money to purchase plane tickets. But thats ok... i think that my parents are planning for me to go out there for Christmas which will be absolutely awesome cause i havent been out there for Christmas for about 10 years.     My parents are going away this weekend.. so if anyone wants to doing anything *wink* *wink* tell me alright lol....    WES AND JAMES... we need to talk.. about this upcoming week cuz i need to know if we are going camping or not...     ok thats all for today :D...

Im probably gonna be doing a list clean up soon so that i can delete the people that dont talk... or just the people that are really annoying.     Yep... Just thought id fill this in before i go swimming... cuz i probably wont be back on the computer till tomorrow... So yeah, were going swimming at the Aquatic Center from 6 to 9... anyone who wants to come is more than welcome too :D...     ok off to swimming i go    **EDIT**    w00t.... just got back from swimming... was are fun :D... James are scared to jump off the diving thingy... Wes CANT jump off the diving thingy.. cuz the first time he tried he just kinda ran off the board and it was very HAR HAR like... LOL. Waterslides were also fun... Steam room... ERRR no can breathe in there... its like a sweaty bath... and your on fire :D.    ok i go sleep now

But tomorrow... tomorrow me and James and possibly Wes are gonna go swimming at the pool across the street from me and we can go ZOOOM down the waterslides and other misc fun THINGS... LOL. I havent been swimming for like a year, even though i should go more often because im a really good swimmer. Just no one to go with since Christian left to goto Princeton... STUPID CHRISTIAN...    **EDIT**    LoL... Steph sent me these randoms pictures... Just thoght id share with everyone lol       (drew hearts on their tounges for some reason?)

      Well its basically 2:30.. and the heat is still rising... GRRR... But oh well, I got a pool in the backyard that I can go jump in anytime i want :D. Currently I am, sitting here typing this out, eatting some noddley soup and hating the heat. Probably gonna go jump in the pool soon cuz its like 31 degrees right now and im sorry but thats far to hot.   HAHAHA James and Wes had to goto this tournament for tennis today in this scourching heat... I wouldnt be surprised if when they got back they were sunburnt. I laugh now HHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA... sucks to be you guys :D.   Yup... only 14 more days till Calgary, Cant wait. Have to talk to Christian later cuz he needs to get all this information ready otherwise we are gonna have alot of problems coming up in a matter of minutes... and thats just NO GOOD whatsoever.   **EDIT**  Well, Christian decided to come home. Apparently he cant get the day off work cause of some stupid japanese people that are coming to visit the mill he is working at, WHICH IS REALLY FUCKING STUPID CUZ ALL HE DOES IS SWEEP FLOORS! But whatever, I guess hes just gonna have to cut down on his time in Calgary. FUCKING JAPANESE...  Well, we've still gotta talk a little bit later... so ill keep it updateing when I get more info.

      Well, well.... I finally decided to make one of these bloggy things because most people have em nowadays and yeah... didnt wanna be left out :P. LOL... anyway its like&nbsp;1:20 now... and the temperture is a bombing 32 in my house. Im sorry, BUT THATS WAY TO FREAKING HOT... But i guess the good thing is is that my parents bought this like pool thing that you can sit in... Provides much coolness indeed.   We had a little mini earthquake here a c0uple days ago. Happened at like 1 in the morning, i felt it as i was still awake from the heat... STOOPID HEAT...   Ill be going to Calgary in about 15 days. Probably gonna be even hotter there... but there i can go swimming everyday at the pool in the clubhouse :D. James is coming along this time.. but isnt stay at my grandparents. So me, James and Christian can go Go-Karting and Paintballing and stuff together this time :D. Happy Fun Time:D.   As for summer so far... It's been boring as hell... Pretty much all ive done this summer so far is gone to see Spiderman2, IROBOT. They were both awesome movies, but it still doesnt beat hanging out somewhere with someone... But of course most people are going to rivers and stuff.. I dont like rivers... PAIN....   This is why i dont like rivers :(...      (for those of you who dont know what that is... Its the bottom of my foot)   Yeah...&nbsp; took like 10 stiches to heal up like that... Dont have a picture of it all bloody.. was quite the site though :D   **EDIT**  It like 8:18 PM now.. and I just got back from a little swim in the pool in my backyard.... SOOOOO REFRESHING!!!!&nbsp; Ive never experienced so much pleasure in a 20 minute period... Cooled me down greatly in the heat!... AHHH... lol yeah..  I called Christian a little earlier and he was being a complete dumbass. EXAMPLE**&nbsp; 4+4=?... yeah took him like 3 tries to get it right... Yeah hes got work tomorrow and if he doesnt ask his supervisor person about taking some time off im gonna have to kill HIM... and hes gotta call the bus station to see if we can purchase tickets from here to leave Princeton otherwise this is gonna get alot more complicated... Which is really not gonna help..  Ok done for today

At like 1:30 me and dimitri left to go swimming for a while... so we went swimming... made some splash's... then went home.  Ate some food... played a little more CS and Wind Waker.  Then at around 7:30 we went swimming again. Made more splashs. Then went home... I played a little more Wind Waker... STUPID GAME.... cant find the freakin triforce crap. Anyway... i played that for a while and then i went to bed... watched wrestling for a while until i finally fell asleep.

      Well... today was another one of those interesting days i guess.  Um.. it started off with waking up at like 9 cuz Christian had to go back to Princeton today. So we were up and about and listening to the Punisher soundtrack until his grandma came around to pick him up.  After he left me and Ashley made plans to go to Steph's house and watch movies... So we did that.  There was like 5 people there... more were suppose to come... but they didnt but whatever.. it was all good cuz it would of been really really really really cramped in Steph's room cuz its so small.  Anyway i went over to Stephs around like 6 and didnt leave until like 10:02... watched Not Another Teen Movie... it was quite odd... but again it was funny lol.  Anyway... ima go play my Wrestling game cuz it has to go back tomorrow :(.

      Well today wasnt such a good day... Well it pretty much started off with Christian saying he was gonna be coming over at like 2.. but actually didnt even arrive until like 7... But whatever.. at least we got to hang out for a while. Yeah... anyway before all that crap happened things werent going so well. Well apparently mine and Steph's friendships are over... I tried to fix things but she just didnt want it to be.. so whatever... life goes on. Ashley and me are now semi friends i guess... We were kinda semi friends before but now so more i guess?? i dunno really lol.  Anyway... me n Christian went out with Audra tonight... we pretty much drove around town looking for somewhere to go, but didnt actually stop anywhere cuz we all had to be back at a certain time which kinda sucked but oh well... anytime with Audra is good time :D.  Yeah anyway, ima go sleep now cuz i got a headache lol.

      Well... today was one of those not so good days.. Steph n Ashley kinda freaked out about my last blog post.. and then i got in alot of trouble from them.. Trying to fix this now..  Talked to Audra for a little while about my whole "insecurity" issue... trying to work on that.. cuz that seems to be what is not helping me out lol.. steph said that and so did audra so... ima work on that...  Yeah anyway... pretty much the whole day i just kinda sat around waiting for 6 to come around so me James and Dimitri could go swimming. Ashley and Jessi were there.. but we didnt talk to em.. i dont like Jessi much.. and i really wasnt in the mood to talk to Ashley... but anyway.. yeah we went swimming and had fun :D... came home... watched a little bit of TV... then played Heres Come The Pain for a while until i finally fell asleep.

      Well.. today Dimitri was suppose to come over at like 11 and deliver me my free game of GTA Vice City.. But he was too lazy to come, but thats ok cuz i wasnt even awake at 11 cuz i wasnt feeling good last night.  Yeah... the rest of the day i installed World of Warcraft and The Suffering. Both are awesome games but World of Warcraft has its problems!...  Yeah i played this games for a little while then James came over and we went swimming... Ashley and Steph decided to join along this time... Glad they did cuz i finally realized something about both of them, which will soon come into effect.  Yeah.. after the swim me and James left before them... cuz we kinda just didnt care anymore..  Gave James his copy of World of Warcraft... He was all happy joy... And then i sat here and made some food to eat which im eatting now.  Oh yeah.. also learned that Christian is coming over on Thursday which will be good :D... He's also coming back another week sometime but i dunno when yet but thats ok.  Anyway, im gonna go and watch THE AMAZING RACE now.. cuz its like the reality show type thingy ever.  **EDIT**  I forgot to update my blog yesterday... all i had to put in yesterday was a picture of my friends!... heh anyway... hes a pic of Mir, Kris and Aly    (Mir is on Left, Kris in Mid, Aly on Right) Mir says they look grubby.. but whatever.. its only a picture lol  I have another super picture... which was taken on our super party night... but i wont post that cuz dont really want too lol.

      Well... today was boring... except until like 7... cuz at 7... james, wes, bret and dimitri came over and we all super partied all NIGHT :D... even though it wasnt all night. but it probably will be cuz were only at 12pm and were all still alive and hyped up on happy sauce. In otherwords... wes and james sprayed this like bug cleaner all over the place and now it smells really bad!... pretty sure we will be up all night. lol.... ok im gonna go cuz bret and wes are freaking out lol  *EDIT* Well.. its the next morning now and its as if we all got drunk. Cuz we were all pretty much hungover... even thought there was no alchohal at all.. but still we were all tired and didnt feel to good lol. As for the night... well... it started off by watching Ashley and Steph on webcam... not gonna go into the details of that event... then they got really boring and started to freak out so we moved on over to Miranda and Kristy.. now this was a happy fun time INDEED. They um.. turned on their webcam to say the least lol.... cant continue on from there cuz Miranda will kill me. lol after we made them sad for leaving them we pretty much all went to sleep. Well pretty much being me and james. Wes, Bret and Dimitri pretty much stayed up all night playing video games and watching movies. I on the other hand wanted my sleep because i wasnt feeling good and i still dont as im writing this. Need to go find some damn tyonhal.. (cant spell) anyway.. thats about it for this GREAT day... i wish everyday was like this... just without the hungover feeling lol

      lol... ignore the name... just all im thinking about at this current moment. LOL anyway today was a fun day because i actually did something. It started off by me waking up.. and getting a call from Ashley. She said they her and Steph were gonna be coming to my house for some visiting at like 11 or something so i said ok to that.  Around 11 they showed up and pretty much looked at my year book for a while. Steph signed it for some reason... even though she doesnt even goto my school. After that they both left leaveing their drinks behind. MESSY GIRLS!!! Like an hour after that James showed up and he watched me play Vice City for a while until Wes and Bret got here. After Wes and Bret got here we left for downtown.  As we were waiting for the bus to show up, we kept commenting on James new lover, "The Wunderbar"... dont ask... its an odd and stoopid story. lol anyway, when the bus got there we noticed that Ashley and Steph were on the bus cuz they missed their stop somewhere in Comox to go see Steven. So we talked to them for a while.. or i should say they talked to us for the bus ride. At the post office this guy came on the bus. We was pretty cool, we taked to him for a bit after they got off the bus about Steph's abnormal BEAUTY, and how annoying Ashley is sometimes lol.  After that we were at the mall and we got off and headed over to Future Shop. James bought this anime DVD thing about some thing... dont really care cuz i dont watch that type of anime lol. Wes bought Spaceballs and Rise of Nations the expansion. Bret bought.. a pop... i bought... a pop. lol after that we headed to Walmart and we bought nothing. After all that we ran to catch the bus back to the bottom of Ryan hill.  Here we stopped at Blockbuster and i rented this game called BUJINGAI.. or something like that, its a game like Devil May Cry. Then we went over to Superstore and Wes bought another 2 games. He bought Megaman Zero2 and Tales of Symphonia. Both of which arent really that good of games but whatever floats your boat Wes. After that we caught the bus home and watched Spaceballs.. FUNNY MOVIE.. CUZ ITS SO STUPID IN MANY A WAYS.  lol.... after the movie was over everyone left. At like 7 we played warcraft 3 until about 10:30. Then i downloaded some porn... watched that for a while... got bored with it.. and decided to update my blog. As i was updating my blog i was talking to Audra and Steph... Audra i didnt really have much to say too because she doesnt exactly create conversation, and i hate trying to start a convo when the other person doesnt say anything lol. As for the convo with Steph... that was pretty much just about her boobs lol... And how i adore them so :D.  lol i think ive written enough for today... ima go sleep now or something... possibly shoot myself
