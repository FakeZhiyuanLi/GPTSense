      Maybe I mentioned in my hiplog that I had hoped to take off every friday in the month of June (or at least work from home). My wife believed in me. And I think that I have pretty much accomplished that. I know I have been at home and being at home considerably more than I have for the first six months of 2004...  So, like I said, my wife believed me. When one of the women that she works with approached her to sell Tonya-Yvonne a chicken dinner for a church fund raiser, my Tonya-Yvonne thought, "[Randy is going to be at home so I'm sure he'll appreciate a chicken dinner.]" That's just how thoughtful my Tonya-Yvonne is towards me.  It is so sweet that she looks out for me the way she does. I really appreciate it. I'm sure I don't always handle it right, but I'm not used to it. By now, I should be used to it from her, because she is thoughtful of me very often.  Anyways, she went ahead and purchased the meal for me, so I was gonna try, with everything that I am,  to stay at home so I could eat that meal. The week turned out not to be looking too good for me to stay at home on Friday. It was because of the royalties project. The accounting department was having some difficulties that pushed our month-end commit date out to the end of the week.  Fortunately, ithe chips fell such that I was able to go into work late. I was able to stay in Richmond long enough for my food to be delivered to Tonya-Yvonne so I could go pick it up and enjoy it like she intended. It was worth it, because the food was pretty good. I I got to receive the benefits of receiving my love's gift.   urlLink

       urlLink    I've always liked playing fighter jet sims. My first was "Stealth Fighter" (or something like that) for the Atari 2600. For a while I played fighter jet sims on the PC. Now that I play games on the PS2 almost exclusively, of course I'm going to play "Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies."  Right now, I'm stuck on Misson 09: "Operation Bunker Shot." I just can't figure out what the real objective is. Once, I almost made it to the end of the mission, but then got shot down. Talk about heart breaking. I hate to do it, but I'm about to go searching for information on how to get through the mission. Hey, a good pilot operates on good information, right?  That's one of the things that make gaming more enjoyable for me, though. Rather than waste time going through missions over and over and over again, I can browse the web for advise and get through the missions much quicker and with less frustration for not being able to figure it out. I look forward to winning this mission.  Gaming brings me joy!

       urlLink    You see, I have made a lot of progress this week. On the same day that I had reduced the amount of reminders, I also reduced the number of unread e-mails I had. I know, I'm really stuck on this right now. You don't understand, though. I'm struggling to keep up with the things I need to do. I'm getting better, though - as evidenced by me getting through all those e-mails (though I just deleted a lot of them). Many of them are just automatted e-mails that come from my database servers anyway. They go to real users. I just include myself on the CC list to make sure they actually go out. Anyways, cheers to keeping a handle on my e-mail. :-)

       urlLink    This is so frustrating! I came into work late, today. After opening Microsoft Outlook, the reminder window popped up. Today I have 59 reminders! That's disheartening since I was down to 40-something yesterday... :-( Well, I have some time. I'm waiting on the accounting group to finish posting transactions and print checks, so it seems that I have some time to go look at my reminders. Let's see how far I can get them down to now.

        I came into work late today. I'm gonna be working this evening, running some month-end jobs. Today was the best ride into work I've enjoyed in a while. It was half sunny outside. I ran through a couple of rain showers, but nothing bad. In some spots I was driving in rain where the sun was shining too! I tell you, between the beautiful trees of VA, the picturesque sky, the comforts of my Accord EX, and the tunes blaring from XM, I was almost in heaven. The only thing that would have made it better would have been to have Tonya-Yvonne and my mom, dad, and younger bro in the car with me. Well, the experience would have been different then, so I'm just gonna value that hour drive for what it was worth. :-)

       urlLink    My last post didn't include the screen snag that I was hoping to post. I found this information at  urlLink http://www.microbe.org/microbes/virus1.asp .  The text actually says:   When is a life form not a life form? When it's a virus.  Viruses are strange things that straddle the fence between living and non-living. On the one hand, if they're floating around in the air or sitting on a doorknob, they're inert. They're about as alive as a rock. But if they come into contact with a suitable plant, animal or bacterial cell, they spring into action. They infect and take over the cell like pirates hijacking a ship.

        I've been reading, off and on, Matt Ridley's book, "Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters." My boss had told me that it was a really good book. He was saying this and got me really excited about reading the book myself. So I went out and bought the book and started reading it myself. It is very well written and it does help me understand human DNA a little better. So far, I have read through chapter 6. I got off track with reading, because I've been at home for the last two months almost and so I've been playing games more so than reading.     I woke up yesterday morning and caught an interest to research the book a little on the web. The first interesting site that I came across was at the link below.   urlLink  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/jan-june00/genome_2-29.html      The interviewer, Ray Suarez asks a question:     RAY SUAREZ: Well, a lot of scientists have said over the years that when faced with the option of complexity or simplicity, that nature has a bias toward making things more simple. So why do we have this thing that's billions of letters long, replicated hundreds of millions of times in every one of us?    So I started thinking about it a little myself. What a brilliant question that was! Anyways, I thought, well, I know viruses have DNA. In fact some of the ways that DNA engineering is performed is by training viruses to use DNA that we want it to use. That's not exactly the right way to say it, but I'm not well versed in DNA engineering.   Anyways, I wondered, "how many DNA are in viruses?" I mean, if we carry "hundreds of millions" of DNA in our body, how many DNA are in a virus? Viruses are so small you can only see them under a microscope, so they can't carry that many DNA, right?   Well, I did a quick search on Google. One of the things I found is below. Its an interesting thought. I guess this could be one form of evidence that humans AREN'T viruses, right?

       urlLink     So every day I come into work, log onto the network, open Microsoft Outlook, think about actually learning a new trick or two, and then get to working. I have been using Outlook's reminder features of e-mail flags and tasks for a long time now - probably about 5 years. Looks like I've gone crazy with them, but it really is more that I have had so many things to do that I never get back to the things that I have tried to remind myself to do. The reminder count was up to 62 at its height this week. I've been averaging around 55 for the past 4 months! It makes me feel like I'm not accomplishing the things that I need to accomplish. New tasks keep coming up. Heck, tasks fly at me so fast now that I don't even bother adding them to Outlook. You see that the number of reminders is down to 41. I'm hoping I can spare time this week to review some more and clear them out or do what I wanted to do when I set the reminders. Note that there are almost as many tasks in my task list that don't have reminders... One day, I'll be better organized. I pray...

      I just found out that "Star Wars: Battlefront" will be coming to the Playstation 2! In fact, it will be released on my birthday. This along with the DVD release of the original Star Wars episodes. I guess I might as well get ready to shell out $100 on my birthday. It will be worth it all, though. I can't wait!!!  urlLink

      This is a pic of Tonya-Yvonne just before we started playing spades. Why she doesn't like me taking pictures of her, I just don't know. She is like one of the most beautiful women on God's green earth. So many people tell her she ought to be a model. I've always thought that. The girl can dance, too! Anyways, in this picture, she's telling me to not take a picture of her. Guess I didn't listen, huh?  urlLink

      For a while, Darrel and I were playing one-on-one. Why do I look like I'm all broke up? I was just playing around. I act stupid while guarding people. At least when I'm not being serious. And why does it look like Darrel is running a football more so than playing basketball? Darrel is Charlene's husband. Charlene is my brother's cousin.  urlLink

      This is a pic of my mom, Darlene, waiting on the chance to shoot the ball. Actually, I think she was talking or something. Later on she put up a couple of nice shots. The event is funny, because I heard her dribbling before I walked around the goal. Its funny, because I didn't know my mom could dribble good. It surprised the hell out of me. It was so cool to see her playing, though. J  urlLink

      So this is me taking a shot. Look at the concentration. Look at that form. Check out the fro! I could be in the movie "He Got Game." Lookout Denzel... You know, they used to call me a prep when in grade school, because I wore collared shirts and stuff. My mom bought nice clothes for me. I couldn't help that. Ironically, I work in an office environment and thus have a lot of collared shirts. I had no plans to play basketball, but it just turned out that way. Would a prep play basketball in his good clothes and shoes? :-)  urlLink

      My brother threw a surprise on Saturday. We hosted the party over at our Aunt Shirley's house. My brother orchestrated the party. Aunt Shirley, Aunt "Boo" and Aunt Wanda prepared the food. I cooked the meat on Aunt Shirley's grill. After eating we all somehow ended up shooting basketball. That was a rare event and an excellent photo opp.   I'll post a couple of pics from the event. It was really nice. Everyone enjoyed the food and the good time. Me, Tonya-Yvonne, James (my brother) and Aunt Wanda played spades for a while. That was cool. I'm really happy that we all have the opportunity to hang out on happy occasions now-a-days. For a while we were only getting together for funerals... Now it is more or less happy times, which is so nice.  urlLink

      I'm sitting in my car listening to XM satellite radio waiting on my  baby-boo to come home. She's bringing chicken home for us to enjoy this  evening. I had planned on cooking, but I left work later than I had  hoped I would. A fiasco went down at work this evening that I'll  unfortunately have to conversate about tomorrow. It's not so much a  fiasco as it is a question of accountability.  Anyways, I'm just happy to be home and out of the weather. It started  raining halfway home and now its just nice to be chilling under our  carport. I can't wait to see Tonya-Yvonne!

       Another day of feeling like blah. Its not like me as of late. I suppose my wife, Tonya-Yvonne, would beg to differ. She hasn't said it lately, but she thinks I can be a rather gloomy person.  I am abosulutely happy to be at home with her. Maybe I'm just not feeling great about being at work right now, because I'm not at home with her. I could be getting bored of my daily chores, too. I just came out of a very intense 6 months of development on this project that we finally rolled out.  I pretty much spent the last six months of my life writing and debugging Microsoft Visual Basic .NET code. I've been doing a ton of data manipulation and validation as well. Could I be burned out?  I took a couple of days off almost two weeks ago. It feels like ever since then, work just hasn't been as enjoyable. I think I got used to having some free time. Now, when I go home, I play games and interact with my wife. Lately, I've been cooking, too.  Take tonight for example. I look forward to listening to some more of Bill Clinton's book, "My Life," while riding home to Richmond in my 2004 Honda Accord EX. Then I look forward to whiping up something for me and Tonya-Yvonne to eat. I'll be hanging and putting away our clothes after we eat, because Tonya will have washed clothes this evening. After putting up the clothes, I'll probably play a game or two while Tonya-Yvonne studies. My woman is going back to school to pave the way for better career for herself and a better lifestyle for us.  Anyways, come on 5:30 PM EST!

      I've been a fan of Samurai Jack ever since I checked it out after Tonya's nephew, Westley, told me about it. I had put off ordering the season one DVD, because I hadn't budgeted for it. I saw it on DVDEmpire.com last week for basically the aame price as a lot of other DVDs, so I went ahead and bought a copy.  The box arrived, today. I can't wait to peel it open this weekend to watch it. It is my favorite cartoon ever! Good plots, cool fight scenes, great sound. I think the sound is what impresses me about the series so much....

      Today was just the gloomiest day I've had in a while. it has been wet  and humid all day. I know - everybody always talks about the weather.  I'm no different. Its always a good icebreaker.  It rained on my way to work. It rained on my way home. It rained while I  was at home. It rained while I was at work.  There was a time that I prefered rainy days. I don't know when that  changed. I really don't. I just know that today's weather was not  preferable in my opinion. The events of the day didn't make my day  anymore enjoyable, either.  Today, a data integrity issue caused one of our programs to suffer  technical difficulties. An attribute of one of the licenses in the  database was changed, which caused generation of a new statement for  royalties payments in our application. Well, daggonit if the new  statement didn't violate a duplicate statement constraint that I had  created in the application.  It took me two hours to debug what happened. Seems like I just hadn't  forseen this problem coming. Its the problems that I'm not able to  predict that always seem to bite me in the ass the worst.  Anyways, I don't want to start my blog off on the wrong tone. Seems like  I have, though. Trust me, though, I'll send mostly positive and up-beat  entries. You'll see. ;-)

      Yesterday was a trip. This week has been a trip. Yesterday, I found out  that one of the Oracle service that  I thought I had running properly  wasn't running properly after all. I just so happened to reboot the  server where the service was running and then when I opened the  management console to connect to the service, I received an error obout  the service not being up! Back to the drawing board. Its time I start  writing manual scripts to achieve my goal instead of relying on this  quirky service.  Anyways, I didn't get to play Madden either. I'm looking forward to  getting some gaming in this evening, but it really all depends on when  I'm done with upgrading one of our database servers.  I'll actually probably spend time on the web, registering on a league,  rather than play Madden. The strategy guide recommends doing that. It  gives links to some Madden sites to find all that kind of stuff. I had  no idea about those sites. Its like a whole new world has been opened up  to me. I'm looking forward to getting registered and getting some  regular gamage going! -Randy  Read my daily rants and raves on my blog at: http://rha_de_osolage.blogspot.com/  Check out my online photo album at: http://community.webshots.com/user/rha_de_osolage/.

        I just came to a realization that I'm starting to look at work not so much as half of my life, but as 48-hours that I spend at work. This is an interesting shift in the way that I look at life. I mean, for the majority of my career, I've looked at work as a part of my life.   Perhaps this is the outcome of me working so much earlier this year. Is this what it feels like to be "burned out?" I personally don't think that I've gotten to that point, yet. At least I hope I haven't.   I'm thinking that&nbsp;it may be because I'm actually comfortable with home life now. Not that I was incredibly uncomfortable with it before, but it was pretty unpredictable. Now, I pretty much know how the evenings are going to go. That in itself is comforting.   Anyway, it was very liberating to think about work as a time-based thing instead of however long it takes thing! So I feel like I have a life now. I guess that's what I like about it.

        So I was thinking on my way back from Chen's Restaurant about myself. Doesn't that sound so self-centered? Anyways, I began to think about some of my flaws. The way I see it, these are my three greatest flaws:        I don't know how to make friends.   I am a chronic procrastinator.   I have a chaotic personality.    Now, while I know there's nothing I can do to change my chaotic personality, I'm sure I can change the other two. I just need to find a way to focus my energy on changing.   I guess I will write more about this later this week. I'm too distracted by "Six Feet Under" to go into great detail, now.

        Whatup?   It was either raining or gloomy all weekend, here in Richmond, VA. I guess it was like that for most of the state. I didn't pay much attention to the doppler radar this weekend. Anyways, it made for a mood to stay indoors. Tonya-Yvonne didn't even leave the house once since she got home on Friday!   I on the other hand, left the house to get food for us. I did go over to EB Games, Friday night, to get the collector's edition of the Madden 2005. The book is only marginally helping me out.   Anyways, I ended up playing a tournament against the CPU, yesterday. I won the tournament. I realized that I'm not good enough to play at the All Pro difficulty. I'd like to, but I'm just not that good. So now, I'm playing at the Pro level and liking it.   I created a team, today. I think I'm gonna start a franchise tonight. Either that or start a tournament with fantasy draft turned on. I guess we'll see.   Tonya-Yvonne has been playing "The Sims" all weekend. She is really enjoying it now that she has learned that she can create malls and restaurants and places other than homes. I think she's hooked on the game. I can't wait to see how she reacts to "The Sims 2". I, myself,&nbsp;am partially looking forward to "The Urbz: Sims in the City," except for the fact that I haven't finished either "The Sims" or "The Sims: Bustin' Out" for the Playstation 2.   Anyways, I feel like I've been rambling in my blog, lately. I don't know what's up with me. Am I bored? Am I content? Its weird. There's no drama in my life, with the exception of being broke, so maybe I'm not feeling interesting enough to think that I'm contributing to the interest of my blog. What's up with that, man?

      I'm at the West Broad Honda dealership right now, waiting on a ride back  to my house. I took a sick day, today, because I felt pretty lousy this  morning. My body didn't want to wake up this morning. It is nice to have  sick days and the option to take them.  Anyways, I'm up to 22.5K mi in my 2004 Honda Accord EX, now. I had to  run over my regular maintenance window, because I've been broke all  month. I can say for a fact that I'm not rolling a phat wad of $20s in  my pocket this month. If I do it will be so that I have it instead of it  being drafted out of my freekin' checking account.  Its all good, though. If I can just maintain through mid-September, I  think I'll be a'ight. I have on more game to buy, Nascar 2005, before  that. And maybe if I can swing it, I'll buy a Logitech steering wheel.  That's dreaming, though. But I have to get the game.  Anyways, its amazing how much time I spend reconciling my checking  accounts. I used to spend a lot of time using Microsoft Money  religiously to track and project cashflow. I haven't devoted as much  time to that practice this year and I see the results.  I may not always be on target with my budget or with the timelines I'm  supposed to pay bills, but at least Money has empowered me to make  conscious and educated decisions about what I was going to pay and when.  More importantly, Money afforded me the confidence to live without fear  that I might not be able to fill my gas tank so that I can get to and  from work. Two weeks ago, I was counting change for gas! (That is the  worst feeling!)  Anyways, I got paid today, so now I can afford to get my car serviced,  fill my tank, and take my beautiful wife to a movie. Yeaaaaa! Its the  simple things that mean so much, right now.  The moral of this post? As Dr. Dre says, "You better get cho money  right!"

      So I've been looking forward to Nascar 2005 coming out. I realized, though, that I would want to create my own driver and car and stuff like that, so that I would enjoy the game better. As I thought more about it, I realized that I would want my created driver to look as close to me as he possibly could. So what does that me? That means he has to be black!  Hey, I'm not "playing the race card" or anything like that. I'm just being real. Why would I have even thought about this in the first place? Because to my knowledge there weren't any black drivers in the Nascar Nextel Cup Series. According to one of the posts in my thread on EA's website, there may be a black driver or two. I need to research this.  Anyways, I was thinking that because of the fact that there weren't any black drivers in Nascar, the developers of Nascar 200x might not have thought to make the create-a-driver interface accomodate for different races. I mean, I want to win this game and when I see my character in the game I want him to look like me.  I'm hoping that Nascar 2005 will allow me to model my character. I mean, Madden and The Sims and other games allow you to customize the way your players/characters look. Why wouldn't Nascar 2005?  So I'm trying to figure this out. So far, EA hasn't responded to my question. I hope they will answer.  I checked Nascar 2004 out from  urlLink gamefly.com . It is very good so far. I'm having troubles controlling my car. I'm thinking about throwing the Action Replay into the PS2 so I can get the max upgraded car and parts and stuff so I can have fun from the outset. I feel okay about doing that since I'm not going to be playing this game that long. I'm all about getting the 2005 game.  Anyways, I created a driver. I wasn't able to customize the drivers look. So I'm really wondering if they'll ever show "me" in the game and if they are, I'm interested in what "I" will look like.  At the end of the day, all I really care about is whether EA allows me to customize the way my driver looks. It'd be cool if they allowed us to customize how the pit team looks, too.   urlLink 14@0.B5cMaVYAxVw.2@.2ce1aca5">

      Now this is what I call level design. I think it'd be a very surreal experience to drive through a tunnel like this for real, but since I don't know where one is, I can't wait to drive through it in NFSU2.  Does anybody know if this tunnel is modelled after a real tunnel and if so where is it?   urlLink Need for Speed Underground 2 Screens for PlayStation 2 at GameSpot

        Whoa! I just finished my first game. I had to get at least one in before the night was over. I played the teams that came up by default. I was Tampa Bay and the computer was Cincinnati. It was cool, because Tampa Bay is my favorite team, anyway.     I started off doing very well. Then I got into some defensive&nbsp;AND offensive trouble. I ended up almost losing. Cincinnati had 7 points with 15 seconds to go. I ended up passing for about 65 yards and then another 6 for a TD and a FG. Tied the game with 5 seconds to go. Went into overtime and beat the Bengalis! Great accomplishment, right? Yeah, right.     So I like this game a lot better. The cheerleaders look better. The game is more crisp all around. So far, I don't see the big deal about the hit stick. It is hard for me to remember to use it. The options for defense are a whole lot more plentiful. I still find it hard to play defense after the ball is snapped, though. I should probably slow my game down until I get used to playing. It has been two years since I played.     So far, I'm not all that impressed with the music. The special features were pretty cool, though. Overall, I love this game! Thank you, baby-boo, for buying it for me. My wife is soooo awesome!

        Was listening to "The City" on XM Radio, this morning.&nbsp;Xzibit was on there. He's a cool dude. I was first introduced to him back when Madden 2000 came out for the Playstation 2. I still didn't know much about him until "Pimp My Ride." The DJ was playin' some of the cuts off Xzibit's new album. Sounded really cool. Maybe I'll have to check out his back catalog. I need some fresh stuff. And I'm talking some non-bling-bling based hip-hop. I can't stand braggarts...

      I've had Madden 2005 for two whole days, now. I figured I'd've played it  a little by now. I'm hopeful that I'll play it before the weekend is  over. This is the first one I've bought in two years.  I ended up cutting grass, today. The yard looks really nice, now. Hey,  I'm a grown man with responsibilities... If only I could be as  passionate about doing indoor housework as I am about doing outside  work. I'm sure that would make Tonya-Yvonne a lot happier. I want, very  much, to make her happier.  Anyways, she bought Madden for me. And she wouldn't let me settle for  the regular version. She encouraged me to get the collector's edition  even though it costs $10 more. How awesome is she to do that? :-)

      It took me four tries, but I finally got through Ace Combat 04 mission  "Whiskey Corridor."  I tried using the A-10, first, but was quickly shot down by some F-117s.  That sucked, royally. I wasn't expecting the enemy to have those planes  at their disposal...  I ended up buying an F-2 Attacker and equipped it with some long-range  air-to-surface missles. That proved to be a better combination, because  I was able to take out the SAMs and AA guns long before they were able  to take me out. That made taking all the other ground units out a piece  of cake!  The F-2 was great for taking hordes of planes out also. I did have  trouble keeping up with the F-22s. I can't wait to get my hands on one  of those later in the game.  I love the F-22s. I don't know whether Ace Combat 04 has the directional  thrusters in the F-22s so I'm hoping Ace Combat 05 does. I keep seeing  info about those planes on the Discovery Wings cable television channel.  Oh, if only I had perfect vision - I bet you I'd be inline for one of  those puppies.  I doubt I've mentioned this in my blog before. When I was younger, my  dream was to be a kick-ass fighter pilot. I wanted so bad to be a part  of that elite set of aces in the sky that so many movies exemplify. And  "Top Gun" just through me over the top. I had dreams that I might be  able to be an astronaut also. (I wonder how many other brutha's from  Appomattox County had dreams or wishes like that... At least in my  graduating class, it seemed like I was the only one thinking that kind  of stuff,)  Alas, in the 9th grade, my mom took me to an optometrist who found that  I had poor vision. I was far-sighted AND I had astigmatism. My  aspirations of flying anything during combat were dashed. If I hadn't  played football that year, I think I'd've wallowed in misery over my  loss  and just become a bitter young man. Thankfully, my mom and  step-father supported me playing sports. That gave me something to focus  on.  Ever since that, I've known the closest I'd come to air combat was  playong games. That's why I'm so happy about the Ace Combat game series.  I'm really impressed with Ace Combat 04, because it really puts me into  the cockpit. I think as I progress through the game I may post some of  the  strategies that I'm starting to master while playing. I guess we'll  see huh?

      I found a picture of a snakehead fish. http://contaminants.fws.gov/images/NorthernSnakehead2USGSFCSClg.jpg  I had no idea this fish was as bad as it is. Check out more information about it on U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Division of Environmental Quality website. http://contaminants.fws.gov/examples/snakeheads.cfm

      I was browsing around for interesting information about Richmond, VA when I ran across the Virgnian Department of Game and Inland Fisheries ebsite. I began browsing that site and came upon this url detailing some troubling information about snakehead fish invading the Potomac River. It seems like this is a pretty serious deal as the snakehead fish is a "top-tier predator in the ecosystem." I wonder what one looks like...  http://www.dgif.state.va.us/newsroom/pr-070904-Snakehead.html

        Man, talk about a lot of weird occurrences this week...     So this week the accounting department started processing royalties for the new month. We all had a conference call to discuss timelines and when we should expect to commit the data into our ERP system. They gave us the expectation of committing on Friday. A conference call was scheduled today to discuss their progress.     I wasn't available to be on the conference call because I was interviewing a DBA candidate. So when I get out of the interview, I asked what they talked about during the conference call. My partner in development of this app told me that the accounting department had said that they'd be ready this evening. This evening! That's one whole day early.     I was floored. It was a good thing I was sitting down. I think I sweated for about a half-an-hour. I don't know why. I should have been completely elated. Perhaps it was because I wasn't on the conference call. All I know is that I was full of energy and mixed emotions all-of-a-sudden.&nbsp;While on the one hand I was excited about the success of the application to allow them to be ready so fast, I was still incredulous about the fact that it was happening so fast. You have to understand, we were right down to the last week of the month for the last two months. Now, we're through the month in less that a week. Wowssa!     Anyway, hats off to me and the other developers of this application. Hats off to the accounting team for working diligently to get to this place. I'm completely ecstatic about this all, because I poured my life into this process/application over the past 6 months and it is really nice and satisfying to see the application have this much of a positive effect on the process. Normally, it takes the accounting department about 8 business days to complete the process. Now, its down to about 4 days. How awesome is that? And this process is more auditable AND it actually feeds the ERP system so that they don't have to enter data into spreadsheets and then enter the payments, by hand, into the ERP system. Wowwssa!     I'm finally okay with it all. I just couldn't believe my ears when I first heard my dev partner tell me the good news. I'm still a little freaked out by it, but I'll be a'ight.

      A'ight. I've known from a very early age that God was on my side. I mean there are a lot of situations that I've been in that could have gone completely wrong. He has also blessed me with opportunities that a black kid from a rural town like Appomattox County, VA would NEVER have.  So yesterday, I was on my way home. I'm trying to stretch my last paycheck as far as I can so I was hoping and praying for a little better gas mileage for the week. Normally, I get 200 miles to half-a- tank. Yesterday, I got just a little better than 250!  50 extra miles to half-a-tank of gas is a big deal for me. I mean the trip from Charlottesville to my home is 66 miles. If my car can pull another 50 out on the second half of the tank, then I will have almost stretched my gas out by a whole day. Now that is amazing.  It really gives me something to brag to my dad about. Everytime I tell him how good of gas mileage I get out of my car he says, "You gotta be shittin' me." Well, he's not EVEN gonna believe this.  I've crossed 20,000 miles in my car, now, so I wonder if it is the fact that I've broken it in has anything to do with it? I'm also a couple hundred miles over needing and oil change. It sounds weird, but I wonder if older oil makes my car more fuel efficient?? Whatever it is, I'll take it until I can afford a little more gas!!!!   urlLink
