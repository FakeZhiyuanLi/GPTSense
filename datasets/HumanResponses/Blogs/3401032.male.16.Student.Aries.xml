      Well, I know that I promised that I wouldn't type again until June 1st, and that I would keep a journal over everyday of the summer, but ya, that didn't last long. I woke up this morning, Friday, and my little sister is still asleep. My parents forgot something after they left for work this morning, so they came back home, beating on the door to wake me up. I let them in and then tried to go back to sleep, but couldn't, so I got up. I took a long shower, and then I got on the internet. DId you know that the New Yahoo Messenger is finished Beta Testing? That means you can download the whole thing now. Go to http://messenger.yahoo.com to do it. It is really cool. SO, I was experimenting with my avatar too. For thos of you who don't know wha an avatar is, it is this little person on Yahoo! that you can customize to look like you. So, when you chat, people can kinda know what you look like, unless you are a real perv and you are a 40 year old man with an avatar that looks like a 12 year old girl. Ew. Gross. So, right now I am listening to Beyonce's "Naughty Girl." Good song... "I'm feelin sexy...I wanna hear you say my name....If you can reach me.....you can feel my burnin flame......." Really good song, EVEN THOUGH I think it is directed towards the female community, the remix w/ that guy is cool. Excuse me, I mean KEWL. Anyway, today, my 20-something year old cousin who just graduated college and is finally home for a while is taking me to play tennis. She is really good at it, and I suck at it. Hopefully, I can learn a thing or two, sense [or since, whichever it is I don't know] I bet my friend Shyla that me and Hugo would play tennis next school year. So, I have to learn how to play tennis over the summer, and I have to be good at it. Okay, now Britney Spears's "Toxic" is playing. "...it's dangerous.... I'm fallin.....There's no escape, I can't wait, I need a hit, Baby gimme it, ure dangerous, I'm lovin it....." That is another good song. Destined to be a classic. Better than that "Everytime" crap she is currently singing on TRL and MTV. So, I still don't know how I promote this site or blog or whatever it is called. I would really like some feedback but I don't know how to get it. Hmmmm. I wonder.... Well, for now, I don't care. According to my site or blog statistics, I am the only one who has viewed it. That means that I am really typing to myself, and as I mentioned earlier, THAT freaks me out. But, I am going to continue 'typing to myself'. "Intoxicate me now...with ure lovin now... I think I'm ready now....." Good song. Now, Eve 6's ......Oh crap, hang on, cuz my new yahoo messenger just finished downloading......OK. Anyway, now Eve 6's "Think Twice" is playing. Good song. Okay, I just finished installing it. It is no different from the Beta version that I have been testing. That's good. Anyway, my wrists are getting tired from typing, so I am going to leave now. Later.

      Well, I know I said I would try and post everyday, but, let's face it: That didn't happen. Oh well, life's a bitch, then you die. So, let me see... to feel you in on what all has happened ssense...or is it since? Oh who cares. Anyway, to feel you in on what all has happened sense or since the last post, it was the last week of school, which was boring. I was exempt from all of my tests accept the Biology test, because the teacher is Satan. No actually, my 17 year old cousin is Satan. Well, maybe her mother is Satan. Well, there is a lot of evil whores where I live. So, things between me and Brandi got kind of wierd. We both knew that we like eachother, yet no one would do anything about it. I had been planning to do something about it for a long time, but never had the guts to, so finally, a couple of days ago, I wrote her a letter. I told her that I still liked her, and that I had a feeling that she still liked me. I asked her if we were going out, or kind of going out, or not. She hasn't answered me yet. I am still waiting, but her dog died the same day I gave her the letter. Talk about a bad omen. But, I think that was what she had been waiting to hear. In other news about my life, today, I finished a comic strip that I had to have finished by May 31st for an Art Project, for Art School. I am entering it in a contest. Hopefully, I will win. Also, I forgot to mention that I am currently writing a book. It is about a man that owns a company that is very successful. He then finds out that a crime organization is operating out of it secretly. The owner of this organization finds out about this, and plans to have him killed, but the company owner gets wise to this, so he changes his name, and joins the crime organization. He is assisted by another organization that cooperates with the FBI trying to stop the bad organization. So, the company owner really works for the good guys, but is undercover with the bad guys. He is trying to find out what the 'Master Plan' of the bad guys is too, while he is undercover. Also, he is trying to track down his new friend, who has disappeared strangely. Little does he know, she has been brainwashed and thinks she works for the bad guys. What is to become of her? What is the bad guys' 'Master Plan', and how will the good guys stop them?!?!?!? Even I don't know...yet, anyway. My friend that I haven't told you about likes to write too. She is 17, and she has written several novels, but they haven't been published. She's cool. Her name is Amanda. She likes to draw, too. She is like the female version of me! It is really wierd. She writes sad, depressing stories though. Not exciting, adrenaline pumping action thrillers. That's okay, though. So, I wonder what all I will be doing this summer. You know what, when I just typed that sentence before this one, I realized that I should keep like a diary/journal thing over the summer EVERYDAY, so I can always remember that summer. And I should post it every night on the net. That would be so cool. Right now I'm listening to Petey Pablo's "Freek-a-leak". Good song. I just burend a CD today, too. I have a CD Series that I make. It is called "My Music". I can hear the Microsoft employees screaming 'Copy-Cat' as I type this. Well, have you ever heard of MACINTOSH, Mr Gates? Can someone say MAJOR COPY CAT! WINDOWS IS THE ONE THAT IS THE COPYCAT! Anyway, what do I care? I am using a Windows Maching to type this! I'm such a hipocrite! LOL, atleast I admit it. Okay, so, this summer, I will try to write down everyday of my life starting from June 1st to July 31st. I won't do the end of May, or the beginning of August, becuse we go to school atleast a week in each of those months. So, the only TRULY FREE months are June and July. Now, I'm listening to Outkast's "Roses". Another Good song. Oh yea, back to the music thing. There is My Music, Volume 1 through My Music, Volume Seven. That is like...uh...let me do the math...a little less than 140 songs in less that 6 months. Wow. That is not very much. Oh, and speaking of music, I'm just going to say upfront that I am all for the music downloading thing. It rocks, so the RIAA can kiss my ass. Anyway, this summer will rock hopefully, and maybe the situation with Brandi will get better...and hotter. LOL. My goal for this summer is to kiss Brandi. Sense, or since, I didn't get to do it before the summer [which was my original goal], my new goal is to do it before school starts. Wish me luck, and I will see YOU on June 1st, if all goes to plan. Later, and stay kewl B-) [Like Me!] LATER!

      Well, I didn’t get to post on Thursday, like I had hoped. Actually I did get to post on Thursday, but it was a repost from something I wrote on Wednesday. So, technically speaking: I didn’t get to post on Thursday. So, to fill you in on what happened Thursday: nothing. Ok, now on to today…Friday! Let me see… hmm… today… absolutely NOTHING happened. Well, in Athletics (Me, and most of my friends plus a bunch of other kids are actually in P.E., which is also called Non-Athletics) we played basketball. It was 6 boys against 5 girls. Now, I know that sounds unfair, but those girls are GOOD. So, technically it was fare. So, when the game was half way over, the girls started complaining because we were actually winning. It was 12 to 0, so the coach was like, “Okay, I’m gonna play on the girls’ team now. So, he started to play and when the game was over it was 22 to 18. The girls won. But, it was fun anyway. Kayci almost broke my neck during the game, but that’s okay. Tomorrow, I may go with Brandi to the mall for my sister’s birthday. That is another thing: Brandi is also friends with my 12 year old sister. Well, she is about to be 13, but still. I think that is so dumb, and it irks me. But oh well, who cares. So, I’m kind of new to this blog thing. I would really like some feedback. I wonder how I get that? Because unless I do start to get some, it’s kind of like I’m writing to myself. And THAT freaks me out. LOL, well anyways, I said the next post would be shorter, so I guess this is a good spot to end it. Well, until the next post, later!

       NOTE:  You must know that the post below was actually written yesterday. I originally had it posted on another site. But today, after school, I found this cool site, so I had to repost on this site since it was so much better. Well, here it is: The First Post. Enjoy.  Well, today as slightly boring. No, I take it back. It was more than slightly boring - it was intensely boring. My science teacher, who is a bitch, was a bitch today. But I did get to see my friends. Oh yes, my friends. Let me introduce them to you. There is L.D. -- the obnoxious, perverted guy with jet black hair and glasses. He raises chickens and has gone to school with me since Kindegraten. And he is extremely annoying to the point of where you want to punch him in the face. But he's my friend anyway. Then there is Hugo. Hugo came to our school in seventh grade. I was the first one in the class to befriend him, then he met L.D. and then during ninth grade, they were best friends without me. That pissed me off, but Hugo isn't as good friends with L.D. as they were. That's probably because Mac is now in High School with us. Mac and L.D. are really good friends, considering the fact that they've been friends since they could talk I guess. I'm not too knowledgeable in the history of Mac, but I do know that in elementary school he was my best friend, until he was homeschooled, then he came back two years later: in a lower class than me. Anyway, we are all friends now. And then there is the guy that is friends with Mac and L.D., so I guess that qualifies him as my friend too, right? Eh, who cares. Anyway, Nathan is like a mixture of the funniest man in the world, with the most obnoxious man in the world. If you mix them, you get Nathan. Need I say more? Then there is Mac's ex-girlfriend: Kayci. Kayci rides horses and she is hilarious. I guess that's why I'm friends with her: because she shares the same sense of humor as me. But Brandi and Violet do too. Violet is afraid of dogs, and kinda weird, but funny. And Brandi is the 'good-girl' of the bunch. She's funny too. Last year, I asked her out and she said no. This year, she asked me out. I said no. We are both idiots. I have a feeling that we will be going out before too long. I still like her, and she still likes me. We both know that, and we don't try to hide it. Right now: we're friends that flirt...a lot...a real lot. Everybody always asks if we are going out, and we always say, "I dunno." or "Maybe." or "I guess." We are, I guess, even though we don't even know it. Anyway, there is the somewhat manly Sondra aswell. But Kayci and her hate eachother. They used to be best friends in Jr. High. Then they got into the biggest fight over the stupidest thing. Now they hate eachother. But I'm still friends with her. Oh ya, I'm a sophomore in High School, and so is L.D. and Hugo. Mac, Kayci, Nathan, Brandi, Violet, and Sondra are Freshmen. The school year is almost over [YAH!] and so I will soon be a Junior, and they will be Sophomores. Anyway, today is Wednesday, May 19th, 2004. It is nearly 6 in the afternoon, and as far as I know, all of my friends our at our town's current favorite hangout place. A little restaurant on the corner of Main Street. I didn't feel like going. I HAD TO TYPE THIS! No, that's not really why. Kayci, Brandi, AND Violet are all there...at once. That is not good because this week, Violet and Brandi are fighting with Kayci. A couple weeks ago, me and Brandi were fighting with Kayci. Next week, though, it will be someone completely different. But we all try to just get along. TRY being the key-word. OH YEAH! I forgot to mention another guy in my class. He is Kayci's 'soon-to-be-boyfriend'. His name is Younger. He is kinda shy, but he is cool. Definitely the outdoors type. But Kayci is too. Well, I'm about to go to Wednesday Night Church. So, until the next update, which will hopefully be tomorrow and not as long, LATER!

      Well, I did it again. I lied. I said that i would post on every day of the summer, and i didn't i am NINE days behind. I am so sorry to anyone who is reading this. Which is probably no one but me. So, I am going to pick up where I left off. Ok, I am at the summer school camp thing i mentioned earlier. The first week was kind of intersting. Two kids, one of whom was my friend. His name was Chaz. Anyway, Two kids at the camp got kicked out for posession of illegal drugs. It was a shock. I am still keeping in touch with Chaz, and he said that the other guy, who was a senior, pressured him into it. But, Chaz is still cool and he is really kicking himself for doing that. Other than that, nothing much has happened. Two girls got in a fight over me. THAT was cool. Also, i dyed my hair. It is brown now. So, one of my advisors needs to use the computer, becuase hers is not working and it is pissing her off so until the next post, stay cool. [LIKE ME ]Later!
