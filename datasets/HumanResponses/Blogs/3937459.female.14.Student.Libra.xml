        anime is good. i am ABSOLUTLY going to see "Yu-Gi-Oh" The Movie! August 13, 2004....Kaiba is a SEXY BITCH!. i love that cartoon. i have some really good cards too. if you are a huge yu-gi-oh fan like me, you would have figured out by now that my screen name is based on my two favorite yu-gi-oh cards. my screen name is mysticalamazon14. card 1, mystical elf. card 2, amazon swordswoman. and 14 is for my age. i don't know who i'll be for halloween this year. lets see, 2000 i was a 60's hippy person. 2001 i was a victorian vampress. 2002 i was a leopard (corey was there for that...he put on a scream mask and ran around scaring little kids..lol....i liked that night). and 2003 i was Ishizu Ishtar....from yu-gi-oh.               love is good. love completes people. they grow to need it. well i know i do. when you love somebody, you as a person change. it becomes uncontrollable to fight back that feeling. it is the best feeling in the world to love somebody. it is the worst feeling in the world to love somebody.....and not be loved by them in return. thats the story of my relationship with corey. i really can't get into it fully, or id be here typing for a year. no one really knows the WHOLE story cause its so long. the only people who know the WHOLE story is Corey Sites and myself. we lived it. and i know deep down inside of him he needs me, he thinks of me all the time, and he misses me. i don't need him to tell me, i don't need to hear lies from his brother or friends. i know. i can see right through his emotions. i wish we had those days again. he will understand my love for him someday.               video games are the best. i love video games. so does corey. that was one factor of why we got together. i love metal gear solid, the sims, and grand theft auto. actually corey turned me on to those pretty much. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas         October 19, 2004. i will get it. and i will make sure corey has it, and he will have a ps2 to play it on.
