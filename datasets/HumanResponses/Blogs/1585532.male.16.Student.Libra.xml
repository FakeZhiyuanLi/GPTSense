      Ahhh, the greatness of technology, computers, the internet, and computer crashes.....Yup, thats right, my computer crashed this last thursday night, and I'm now screwed because I have no pictures for MLIP.  I'm still trying to scrounge some up, but it's looking pretty dismal.  I'll of course though, keep working on the site, and hopefully next week (4th of July, where something weird is BOUND to happen), I'll have some pictures.  I'm uploading stuff so uh, ta.

Okay, over it.  Yeah I get to do some photos for a website since the admin's too busy to do it right now.  I've done photos for him before.  The place would be http://kweb.us.  Anyways, nothing much new going on in my life.  Bought a new CD, Rammstein Live Aus Berlin.  Nice CD.  Just a live concert from Berlin, all there songs.  In other news, my friend has set up her message boards here http://www.bigassgoldfish.com/community/.  Meh, its all hot in here, going to go dump some water on me or something...Ta.

      Well I'm back!  And with pictures too.  Theres about 35 or something of them, and thats all you'll be able to see about my life this week due to the fact that I have to do some photo work for another website.  I actually ditched Sea World because it was lame as hell!  I went to this place called Belmont Park and rode the Giant Dipper.  It was pretty damn good.  It was like built in 1925 or something.  Anyways after that I went to Knott's and rode some coasters and crap, took a few pictures of things there too.  Anyways I'm hungry as hell right now.  So I'm going to eat some food.  Ta.

      O. M. G!  School's finally out!  We're completly done now!  All I have to work out is summer school....blah.  MLIP is going very well!  It looks like it's going to be up on Friday.  I'm not really sure about how I'm going to keep schedules, but it will work out eventually.  Anyways the last day of school was fun!  I ripped up my math final and went online...but I accidently showed my friends "Robb and Elissa's Cedar Point Trip."  That was not the best idea.....And Amy, thats a scary as hell picture of Robb!  What did people do to deserve to see that!?  Anyways, I'm gonna go do some stuff...get ready to go to SeaWorld, which is going to be um....interesting.  Anyways, later!

      Ahhh!  The sun blows in so many ways....just like the Angels!  I found my camera, and it works, so MLIP will start soon.  After the Angels game I got really bored as hell and started messing around with some old Star Wars crap.  I got creative...Alittle  too  creative...  Anyways you'll get to see sooner or later, when nothings going on in my life.  I saw the most awsomest shirt today!  It had Strongbad on it!  YESSS!  Ohh beware because Strongbad owns j00.  And the Angels game totally sucked major balls.  I could not believe I dragged myself out for that.  The only reason I went to that gay-ass game was to get my free subway Food from my parents.  The sandwich even blew kinda!  WTF?!  I'm probably ordering pizza tonight, frikken bored as hell.  I was talking to my much awsome friend, but she went to go work on her site.  I added the "Random Picture of the Week" too.  It just shows crappy pictures I think are funny week to week.  Oh yah, Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there.  From the teen-pregnancy screw-ups to the really old geezer dads, have a great day.  My sister's using nail-polish remover....it smells funny.  Yet oh-so-satisfing.....::falls out uncounsious from huffing nailpolish remover::....ugggggghhh.

Hah, good song.  Anyways soccer games comin on at one, so I get to watch that, that'll rock some ass, well not really.  Cuz its MLS, like the lowest form of soccer.   But yah.  And UbU, you suck.  And now thanks to my most-awsome friend, we have new colors!

Whats up?  Anyways.  Yah I'm tired of people who like, act all happy and crap.  You can't be happy  all  the time can you?  I mean seriously.  They're like happy even if they're friend is dying in front of them.  They'd be like "But look on the positive side!"  WHAT THE HELL IS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF DYING DAMNIT!?  GOD DAMNIT HELP ME!  DON'T JUST STAND THERE!  Jeez.  And people who don't blink bug me too.  They just like....stare at you.  and its creepy.  I'm like "Ummm, could you like, blink or something?"  Too many freaks, not enough circuses....Well I'm ranted out, Ta.

      Damnit!  Gotta love technology.  Now that I own a laptop, I hve to dish out $130 for a new battery.  God damnit.  Anyways, this laptop opens up new opportunites for me.  I'm working on a new presentation too.  Plus I get games on this thing.  Its a Compaq 5300 LTE with interchangeable CD/Floppy Drive.  Pretty bitchin with a P133 mhz processer and a 1.26 Gig HD.  Not bad for $75.  Too bad I have to dish more than the laptop for a battery.  Damn technology to hell....

      Well....After going to Knott's yesturday, I feel like crap.  I'm hungry, tired, bitchy...It sucks.  Damnit.  Why is it like this?  Anyways it was fun meeting my friends Angel and Chris again.  They're always cool.  I took pictures.  They MIGHT make it into MLIP if I feel like putting in Knott's.  I swear the paint inside this one ride is so ugly.  And you can still get high off the fumes.  My friend made a site.  It'll be added soon enough.  It's called Smooth Stop...I won't say anything.  It's pretty good too.  Makes mine look like crap...oh wait it always looks like crap...Well I'm going to find something to eat, Ta.

      Ah jesus, its been forever since I've done an entry.  Gotta get that homework stuff out of the way.  Yup, I'm on independent study now.  Its kinda fun.  Though challenging, reason being?  Two words:  TIME MANAGEMENT.  God its hard.  Anyways, I'm looking at buying a laptop, so I can sattelite from my laptop and run this thing wherever the hell I'm at.  I just need to find a reasonably priced one.  I don't need some new-fangled $1000 machine.  I just need a workhorse with a CD-ROM Drive.  Damn.....I hate technology.

      Wheeee!  Happy 5th of July!  Oh wait.... Yah well Happy late 4th of July everyone.  After surviving a family trip to Disneyland and the LA Galaxy game, I'm here talking to you my loyal viewer....(s).  The game was fun, but it was a tie.  But....I got the best 5 dollar horn blowie thing ever!  You blow into it, and it like, makes lots of noise.  So that was the best 5 dollars I ever spent in one night.  Fireworks were insane.  I swear to god I thought I was going to like, die or something.  Friggin' loud ass explosions.  Shockwaves went everywhere.  It was like....BOOM!  Thank god I didn't like go deaf or something.  Yah anyway, its hot as hell, and I have a swimming pool...Ta.

As I watch TV right now, I see a truck rocking back and forth...Uhh, that makes no sense?  Anyways, yah so you will have pictures this week, and sorry that I didn't update the random picture of the week, I've been having trouble getting onto my site lately....Gotta love AOL.....God damnit I hate AOL.  Anyways yah Disneyland, uh yah.  Have fun with whatever you guys are doing today.  I'm bored now....lost track of what I was talking about..Ta.

      Ah and today I look down at everyone going to Pathetica-er Pacifica High School.  Why, the school sucks.  Reasons. 1.  The kids there are all stuck up little snob ass pricks.  I hate them with all my heart, thank god I don't have to put up with them anymore.  And you all can burn in hell you little bastards. 2.  The Vice Principle.  He's a damn robot, and doesn't do worth sh*t for your problems.  He just recites a speech over and over and over again whenever you're in his office.  He can kiss my ass that SOB. 3.  Some of the teachers are just retards, they don't deserve to be teachers because their IQs are lower than the students they're teaching.  Again, repeat the above, kiss my ass you retard teachers. 4.  The school in general just sucks.  No two ways about it.  Now if you put all those together, you have Pathetica!  The worse highschool ever.  Now of course, there were a few people that might still go there that were my friends, you know who you are, you aren't a little bastard, you were cool.  As for everyone else, I hate you, you need to die.  Go burn in hell you bastards.  Well, my rant's over, ta.

      Well, soccer is officially awsome now.  Though it does semi-hurt your feet.  Anyways, I've added a link in my links page, an awsome cool page by my friend.  It's under awsome-ish sites.  Anyways, I'm hungry, and there's a pizza lunchable next to me, put those two together.  Ta.

      And after surviving a giant tree collapse, I decided to update all of you dedicated viewer(s)...I'm still alive!  Anyways, yes, I did have a huge piece of green tree fall near my house yesterday.  It was quite freaky.  I didn't mind it though, gave me an excuse to use a chainsaw (muahahaha!).  Has anyone noticed the heat is just crap lately?  I hate this stuff, its evil as evil can be.  It needs to die, and fast.  Well, I'm about spent, since I'm posting on my laptop and I don't want it to explode...::KABOOM::  --Error:  The current user can not be reached at this time, please try again later.--

      BS to all who think my site sucks.  BS means.  Bite......Sandwich.  That's right biznatches.  Anyways I decided to go onto this ACN place and like, start posting, but amazingly (suprise suprise) some ass was posting irrelevant crap on the boards.  So I'll probably never post there again.  But then I don't know.  I'm confuzed now.  Okay anyways, so let me tell you whats going on in my life right now.  My friend's computer is possesed.  It's making random sounds in the middle of the night, from screaming to mooing.  And I have more work from the wonderful world of the OCDE, thank you for not slowing me down at all and keep me doing homework for the rest of my life.  Obviously nothing really bigs going on.  My friend went to Ohio, my other friend is at KBF right now, and I'm sitting on my ass.  Well it's time for me to go, gotta exercise the demons out of my friend's computer.  Ta.

      Software at its finest:  My computer's been acting up and I won't be able to load another MLIP for a little while.  So I'll be able to blog alot more than I used to (which was barely at all anyway).  Anyways, I've finally started soccer and its like, whoa.  Hard to get back into shape!   I'm not saying I'm fat or anything, but after that 90 minute practice, I was sore.  Very sore.  I'm happy I left my school.  Pacifica High School sucks so much ass.  Everyone there is an asshole.  I'd rather be hit by a truck than go back to that trash heap of a school full of retards.  I hate everything about that school.  Hands down.  Anyways, its funny to make fun of people who go there, and they just  get all angry but will never be able to do anything to me since I'll never go back.  Well, I'm going to go beat the living crap out of my computer, maybe that will fix it.  Ta.

So I needed to get resources ready to go for my maze.  I have almost all the props and such.  All I need to do is work on them.  So yes, my website is still alive, despite what people say.  You'll get an interesting MLIP soon...Just need to get my camera working... Well, back to work.

      And in sports today, U16 Boys team Grove took out the Cerritos team 1-0.  Yup!  We won!  Yaay!  Our season won't be a huge losing streak of death and destruction.  We'll win some, and lose some, just like a real team.  Anywho, the team we played were abunch of asses....Mainly a player in the #11 jersey, he yelled and crap at almost EVERYTHING we did....So did some parents...Thank god the ref was fair (unlike the ref at Los Alamitos....jerk), because there was a lot of tension between the teams.  I knocked a few people over, but in the first half I was taken out by one of those jerkoff players...injured my left knee.  Can't put weight on it for awhile either.  Hopefully it'll heal up before Monday.  Well, as for me now, I'm bushed, I'll see you all on the flipside...Ta.

      What game is cool?  GTA III.  This game takes the old school top-down version of GTA...and makes it 3-D.  It rocks.....Go buy it now before I slap you with this old piece of fish.  Seriously though, this game is pretty cool.  You like...steal cars and shoot crap....Take your anger out on virtual people.  Anyways, with school around the corner (sucks for you!  Especially people who go to Pathetica!), I'm gearing up for a whole 'nother year of slacking and sleeping, with some independent study thrown in to the mix, not to mention the oh-so-obligatory soccer.  And really, this is uber cool.  I mean, I don't even have to really have a set "wake-up" time anymore.  I just hit the sack when I'm wasted, and then wake up when I recover.  This way, I don't have classes to be late to or any crap like that.  So in closing, sucks for everyone that has to go to school.  Ta.

      And I'm still around folks!  Sorry that there hasn't been a whole lot of updating at TTLG for some time now, this maze has proven harder to do than first thought.  Anyways, since I have....less than 3 days left, I'll be working overtime to get it finished.  If you all be good, you'll get a photo update too!  Just wait until after Halloween, after that I'll be done.  Well, again, the maze is calling my name, and it's saying, "Patrick, get the faulk out here and finish me dammit!"

Anyways, don't expect a photo update of me making it, mainly because I don't want to show you what techniques I'm using (yes I'm going to be mean and not tell you so there!).  I will show you the finished product of course.  Anyways, homework is starting pile up.... ::giant pile of homework attacks me::..

      Woo hoo!  Damn, feels like a hangover.  Anyways, I've gone to Haunt a total of....drumroll please....2 TIMES!  WOOO!  With trip number 3 on the horizon and my maze slowly progressing to it's final stage, it looks like everything is going the way it should be.  Though I do feel like a 18 wheeler has ran me over a few times and I still have the smell of fog on me...heh.  Musta been a craaaaaazy night last night!  I remember most of it.  Anyways, I  HIGHLY  recommend Haunt if you live in SoCal somewhere near Knott's.  You want a badass fun time full of scares, screams, and laughs?  Go to Haunt.  Go.  To.  Haunt.  Anyways, I'm gonna go shower all this fog smell off me, it's realllly starting to creep me out.  Ta.

Thanks to the viewer(s) and such sendin me happy bday emails.  That was cool.  What really rocked was Haunt....If you live in California, you MUST go.  Period.  You have to go, or I'll hunt you down and beat you with my caution tape.  Got about $116 for my bday, so now I have money for misc. things.  Yaay!

      Well, I'm still around, after much drama and such, I'm back on here talking to you viewer(s).  Hopefully you all didn't think I just keeled over without telling you guys, because I'm not like that.  Anyways, after much Halloween effort, that paid off nicely.  Now It's all in my room.  My music playing all the time and my scary room, yup.  Well, I think I'm in the boring part of the year now.  Why you ask?  Well, let's see.  Its cold, its windy, and its boring.  But hopefully I'll survive...somehow.  Seems like after Halloween the fun rating just drops doesn't it?  Well, I'm going to go find some decent soup, because the last soup I had sucked.

      Well, here we are at the end of another year.  This is my last post of '03, guess I better make it good.  Anyways, I'm going to a party at my uncle's house.  I'm gonna try and get some people to play DDR tonight.  I'll just beat the ever loving crap out of them though, so I'm bringing 1st through 3rd Korean Mix in.  After that its the obligitory Bingo with prizes, and then getting wasted...(on my own time of course)...Mainly DDR though.  I'm actually pretty good at it now.  Especially since I practice on a softpad, which is harder than hell to play on.  Anyways, I wish you all a Happy New Year, and seriously, don't drive while drunk.  It's not cool.  If you do get drunk, don't drive.  Well, its been a great year, here's hoping for another great year! (and my website lasting that long too)

      Wow, after trying to install 2 different video cards, I eventually gave up on the industrial computer.  It now sits in a pile of scrapped parts.  Not exactly sure what I'm going to do with that....  Anyways, now that I have a store creit of 102 dollars at Best Buy....uh I have no clue what I'm doing.  Overall Xmas was cool until everything I got like...fell apart.  My scooter was pre-assembled by retards and does not work.  Good luck trying to send that POS back....both video cards have just not liked my now-broken computer, and I'm back to my laptop!  Thought thats not going to stop me from passing out underneath my couch at New Years.....And with the arrival of New Years means the leaving of stupid guests at parks such as Knotts.  Thank freakin god.

      Wow, its Christmas Eve, and I still don't have my freakin' California ID that I applied for in October.  The DMV freakin' sucks.  I dont' understand how it could take this long to send my ID.  Its not like I'm across the state or something, I'm a friggin rock's throw from the place!  Those assmonger retards have no clue of what they're doin.  They all need to die.  With all Christmas related stuff out of the way, all I have to do now is pretend to enjoy the holidays.  Though New Year's is way better...because of all the alchohal consupmtion.  (Oh wait I don't need to wait for New Year's for that!)  I have to eat at my Aunt's house for Christmas, which is farther away than any other relatives that live in Cali.  Plus her house is freakin small.  Its almost as small as my room.  As to how she's fitting like...50 of us in there, I have NO clue.  Well, I updated my site, and you can all stare at my desktop and watch almost every move I make now.   urlLink The Amazing Desktop Cam   Now you can all watch in amazement as I do...nothing.  Okay 'nuff said.  Bye.

      Well, after a long time of working with those stupid Nazi-Boxes (Macintosh Computers to you normal folk), I decided they can live in my closet, because they suck.  Well, I did give one away for a dance mat, which was a good trade.  (Sucks for you Kevin!)  Anyways, the oh-so-happy/commercial time is almost upon us.  I've been thinking of doing a photo update for a lonnng ass time, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I'll probably do one for Christmas, shoing you all the neat (or craptacular) things I get.  Which should be fun.  Oh yeah, have fun on Winter Break...God knows I am with this great Earthquake we had!  That was fun!  Mainly because I had no freakin' clue that it was happening..but yeah.  Anyways, I'm going to draw an Atari Penguin.  Ta.

      Okay wow, Macs piss you off.  And I don't know why.  But they do.  After receiving some post WWII era Macs (no pun intended, seriously, they run 33mhz at top speed), I think these might have been the Nazi Party's secret weapon.  And think about it, its genius!  To develop "boxes" with TV screens and an advanced recording system that somehow plays a series of scenes on the TV screen, fooling the user that they actually bought a working computer!  After a while, the user gets enraged at this machine since it does absolutely nothing.  Also it has eye-burning colors that just suck.  After repeated attempts to operate the Nazi TV Box, the user becomes angry and punches it in the screen, which would electrocute him and he would die.  Now all the Nazis had to do was mass-produce them in a wide variety of colors and sizes, and then to put them onto the market at reasonable prices, and you have the Macintosh corporation.  Pure genius....

      Wow, long time of no posting.  Mainly due to homework and stuff.  Anyways.  I was out and Disneyland again yesterday, except this time it was way more enjoyable.  After getting woken up at like...7 am (which is early for me), I went out to the DLR at about 8:30.  Got there, got in, blah blah blah.  First ride I go on, the rocket things.  Fun times.  After that we walk over and ride Indy.  Ooo fun boulder smash its over.  Then we go on the Jungle Cruise.....I don't know why we did...but we did.  Okay thats over, let's go on the big spooky house, also known as The Haunted Mansion.  Fun, got off.  Splash has only a 20 minute wait.  Hmm.... why not?  Okay its been over 3 years since I've been on this thing.  It's really freakin cool...if you like getting wet.  After that we go on the Canoes.  Which were full of tards who can't paddle for crap.  Nobody understood the word "rhythm."  Kinda sad.  After that, uh....oh yah..Haunted Mansion.  After that, ooo Pirates.  Arrr.  Best.  Ride.  Ever.  Becase I get to say.  Arrrr thar be x number of people in my party says aye.  Yah shut up pirates rock.  Then we went over to Tomorrowland, or...Whole-lotta-nothingland.  Went on Star Tours...wow.  Okay...got off, and went into the arcade.  (best part of my day).  We go and I play DDR 5th and Extreme.  w00t.  Go eat pizza.  Mmmm.  Went over to Dirt Cheap Attractions....er Califlour Adventures.  Went on Screamin...which was broken.  So we waited.... then  we went on Screamin.  That orange crappy ride broke.  So we went on Soarin'.  Whee okay over.  Go back to Disneyland and go on..Haunted Mansion.  Yay.  Okay after that um...back over to Tomorrowland, and I play more DDR.  We go in Innoventions...and I play some dumb soccer game that blew because China beat me.  And then....uh.  We went on Haunted Mansion like..4 times.  Okay, hungry.  Let's go to Downtown Disney.  We rode the Tin can on a Toothpick (The Monorail) and ate food.  Okay, come back.  Its like...8:40 PM or something now.  Lets go on Haunted Mansion!  Okay, so we did.  Met my old Jr High/High School friend that I hadn't seen in like....forever.  After that um...we went on the ride.  Okay done.  Time to go home.  Oh look, its my friend again.  Got to stop and talk with her for like...10 minutes.  Which was awesome, since I haven't seen her since like 9th grade.  I gave her my sn and then I went home and at Jack in the Box.  There's a fun day in a nutshell for you guys.  Okay...it took me a really freakin long time to type this, so...bye.

      Hmm...Haven't posted since Saturday....  Might be a good time to post now...  Should I?  Why not...  Not bad ending weekend.  As I round off the end of the weekend by sitting here watching the final hours of this three-day weekend from hell pass by me, let me tell you how Disneyland was.  It sucked.  Plain and simple.  Why?  Here's why.  I really didn't feel like getting off my ass to go to DLR on Sunday.  Waking up at 11 AM, and hearing my family going ballistic on each other.  There's an instant sign that this days gonna be great...  Anyways, we go eat at Carl's Jr.  Which was pure and utter crap by the way, nothing had any flavor what-so-ever.  I'm pretty sure I tried about 4 different sodas, and they all tasted the same too.  Like crap.  Okay so we leave and head out to my Aunt's/Uncle's house. (Conviently located about 5 mins walking distance from my house)  And, we head off....  Car ride was somewhat decent.  Mainly arguing, light cussing, nothing real severe.  So we get to the parking structure, park and go on the best ride.  The tram!!  Okay not the best ride, but hey, at least it hasn't derailed and killed someone...  Get my new Annual Pass (ie Anal Pass for all those 4,000 lb assholes who screw the entire park over and think they deserve every freakin thing their cholesteral clogged heart desires, and to that I say, screw you, damn smacktard assholes), which has no blockout dates, not like it really matters since I'm not actually going there all the time.  Okay so we get into the park, and dump about $120 on food.  FOOD!?  WE JUST ATE AT CARL'S!  Well...I didn't eat anything all day actually.  All I had was a chocolate milk.  Thats about it.  Then its time for us to go on rides...erm, well most of us at least.  My cousin (who wanted to go with me but I wouldn't let him, my patience has worn thin long since before I stepped foot in the park), my sister, and another cousin went off and did rides.  God knows what they did, like I care.  As for me, I just dropped by the arcades and smoked a few kids at DDR, always fun.  After that I just...roamed really.  Nothing in Tomorrowland was open, save that Star Wars ride and the Car Ride.  Screw that, I'm not waiting 40 minutes for those rides.  Oh, Splash Moutain just re-opened from a breakdown..5 minutes eh?  Okay.  So I walk to the ride...walk by Indy-40 mins, Pirates-30 mins, and HM-20 mins.  I get to the enterance of Splash and it's a freakin hour wait already!  So screw that too.  If I want to get wet, I'll just take a shower..communists.  So I walk over to the nearest thing.  Haunted Mansion.  Wait in line, which had so many freakin directional changes that by the time I got into the ride, I had NO GOD DAMMED IDEA WHERE THE HELL I WAS!  Anyways, go down the elevator, blah blah blah, more lines, get a free fastpass thing to ride again, go on the ride.  Repeat, except for waiting in line thanks to the fastpass.    Okay, so HM was fun.  Now off to something else.  Oh oh what's close?  Pirates is close, 20 mins..eh not bad.  Okay fun yah blah blah waiting in line arrr yo ho yo ho okay over.  Pretty decent, kinda cool after I saw the movie.  Okay what next?  Well...Indy is close..okay.  So I walk over to Indy.  Get single rider thingy, and wait like...10 minutes.  Some kid taught me some crap about  the FastPass machines that can possibly get me kicked out of the park, and then I rode.  Fun.  Okay, so time to go meet up with family.  We do, and...we go on Pirates again all together in our own boat.  Get off.  Starts raining.  We go home.  Ride home:  I'm hungrier than god knows what, and my parents stop at McDonald's (yuck).  I eat a salad, and have a coke.  Stay up till about 1 AM, and then drop into my bed.  IT'S OVER!  Yah, really..it is.  So....bye.

      Wow, the week wasn't half as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Now I just have to get through the weekend.  I have to go to "The Happiest Place on Earth."  Oooo boy.  Sunday+Disneyland=LOTS of stupid guests=pictures for my site.  Plus, if I can catch any guest stupidity on camera, it's going straight to a MLIP update.  Anyways.  I did end up buying a semi-decent webcam.  And it's fun.  I'll sit there and type, and people will watch me.  Wow!  But for right now, everything's all blah-ness.  I'm stuck at home, and my family left to go watch my little sister play soccer, for reasons I cannot understand.  Oh well, Disneyland is going to be a huge hell-hole.  And my parents decided to buy me an Annual Pass (blah).  Not really what I wanted, since I barely go there anymore.  But, I guess I'll check it out periodically and see if anything is actually open.  I'm probably just going to hang around the arcades for a while tomorrow.  I'll just play DDR for awhile.  Maybe go on like, a few rides.  No big deal though.  Half of them are probably closed.  Oh well.  It's looking like DDR and capturing guest stupidity tomorrow.  Well...I'm bored, and hungry, and I want to play DDR.  So....bye.

      Well, I take back what I said yesterday.  This week isn't going to suck...that much.  It's going to suck, but not half as much as it could've...  Today was fun.  I went to Knott's and met my friend.  There was much fun to be had.  And much fun we did have.  I started off around 10:30 ish, forgetting my satire camera and all.  Had some Del Taco breakfast, which didn't taste that bad, and I was off.  In or an amazingly boring day...or so I thought.  A whole bunch of Australians were there...and they were like...Americanized.  They had a whole crap load of logo'd and namebrand stuff.  It was creepy.  And so I met my friend who like..works there, that was cool.  I got reallly bored and played DDR for some time.  After that I like..kicked back for awhile in the shade.  Then around 1-ish, I met my friend who I hadn't seen since last year (may not be a long time to you guys but damn, it was for me!).  We hung out and had much fun.  I played DDR with my friend for the first time ever, and didn't do that bad.Then a bunch of other kids from Western dropped in.  Woo...kinda.  Liked it better when there wasn't as many people.  Oh well.  And yah, it was all good.  We all chatted and stuff, very fun.  No pictures due to my stupidness, by leaving my camera at home, which I shouldn't have done, but oh well..More pictures at a different time then.  Got home, talked to my most awesome friend online, and decided that I should buy a webcam since my Desktop Cam is semi lame.  Ate dinner, and now we're here.  Though I'm in a semi-bitchy mood.  Which sucks.  Probably since I stayed up last night and I shouldn't have, oh well.  Broke my computer chair today too.  Don't know who built this thing but it sucks.  I must steal my parent's old chair when they buy a new one for their computer.  Score!  Now I'm getting a coke and an apple pie from McDonalds.  Yay.  Well, I'm leaving.  I'm bitchy, and semi-tired...Bye.

      Wow, this week so far already partly sucks.  Though I do have all my weekly homework stuff doen and all, its just one of those weeks I think.  My family turned against me.  They're all phone Nazis.  Every freakin one of them.  Oh well.  Anyways, after talking to a new friend yesterday (its 12am...so yesterday is correct..whatever), and made her a mod for my boards.  Too bad she lives in freakin Chicago Illnois.  Oh well, she said she's planning to come out here.  I'm hoping we'll eventually meet.  Shes quite awesome.  She loves Invader ZIM, which doubly-rocks because nobody likes it anymore, I'm like one of those dying breeds.  ZIM rocks.  Anyways, we talked for a looong time.  Like..really long.  She's cool, and I wish she lived out here.  Because she rocks.  In other news, my forums are going strong with...drumroll please...7 MEMBERS!  Wow.  Join up, there's a link on the sidebar on this blog too, so you can sign up and have fun with all 7 members.  Be one of the few, the proud, the...I don't really know but yeah.  My computer works.  I love it.  I taped some old piece of cardboard that says "Chameleon" on it.  So my computer now has a name.  Scary.  I'll shove a pic up online later today.  Along with something I'm making on my computer.  It's like...a ride at Knott's...but cooler.  It shows my mad skillz with CAD.  Yeah, well.  I'm really friggin tired and I just did a bunch of homework so....bye.

      God, my back hurts.  Anyways, sorry for the lack of postage, there really wasn't much going on.  The MLIP I was working on decided to corrupt itself and screw everything up.  After trying to restore it, it corrupted again.  I eventually gave up on it.  But that doesn't mean that there's nothing new on the site.  I managed to do one thing already in 2004 that I promised.   urlLink New Messageboards.   So now you can post to your heart's delight in a decent looking forum instead of that pile of crap I used to have.  Okay, so what's new?  Well I went to Knott's yesterday, that was tons of fun.  For once, HOLY CRAP!  NO CROWDS!  I was half expecting a bunch of people there for some reason.  Probably since I had to put up with all those tards during the holiday rush.  So, I get to the park, empty blah blah.  None of my friends are around thanks to school.  Thought it was going to be an entirely boring day all-together.  WRONG!  Mid-day I meet up with some Australian kids on Ghostrider, we all ended up hanging around with each other and I showed them some things I know about the park, and showed them DDR, which was hilarious because I was limping it since I bruised my knee and I still think a few people were amazed.  Great day, hopefully I'll talk to a few of them via internet soon.  They actually took a liking to me I think, and they said I was the most "Aussie" person they've met in the US.  (aka, I'm not some tight-ass that'll sue at the drop of a pin on my foot.)  I poked fun at a few things and did my "Ahhh-nold" impression, along with a few others.  After that we all chatted about how strange the US is, and I got to talk to them about Australia.  Being a person who actually studies other countries, I amazed them with a few things that I knew about Australia that would normally go over an American's head.  They're going to hit Disneyland soon they said, and good luck to them.  That place is probably  still  a holiday hell hole.  Overall, that day was one of the best days I've had at Knott's in a long time.  Though I'm still waiting for Halloween Haunt...  Well, that about does it, I'm gonna get back to my new message board.  -Signoff-

      Oh god I hate being addicted to DDR.  I went down to Nickel Nickel at Cypress and played DDR nonstop for like...4 hours.  Competition was horrible, except for this one girl that was about 13, she was better than me!  As a matter of fact, I'm going to say hi to her on this post because she was damn good, I don't know if she reads it, but whatever.     Hi!! Damn you're good at DDR, hope to see you around sometime, it was great playing DDR with you!  Thanks for playing with me!   Anyways, I played that and got really burnt out after playing for so long, and I was trying to max combo Dam Dariam on Standard, but my reaction time was shot.  Should've done it earlier.  Afronova was awesome, I just put it on light so I could do those damn cool 360 moves.  I love doing them..people stop and stare and go "wow," which is always hilarious.  Anyways, I'm gonna wrap up this post.  Hope I see that girl again, she was badass.  -Signoff-

      Woo Hoo!  First post of '04.  Happy New Years to all you people out there.  Anyways, my NYE was spent at my uncle's house, we all had fun.  Got home, slept, next day went to Fry's and bought a brand new MoBo and 256 MBs of DDR 3200 memory.  Picked up a GeForce 5200 FX 128 MB 8x AGP video card.  Then I jet over to Best Buy and picked up a 40 Gig Hard drive and a new all digital dance pad.  Its soo nice.  (I still use the other one, but now I can do versus)  Anyways, yup, you guessed it!  I'm on a brand new re-built computer.  I built this computer myself and its running soooo smooth.  It handles all my games like a dream.  I get about 80 FPS on No Limits with the highest settings.  I have almost all my games on there, including my DDR simulator with 98 different songs from 1st thru 3rd Mix.  This thing runs so nice.  Only thing that pissed me off was that it had integrated audio.  Oh well, saves me the trouble of screwing with my Ensoniq sound card, I'll probably give it to my sister's computer that I'm working on.  Anyways, here are the specs on my brand new computer.  CPU - 478 pin Celeron 1.7 Ghz Memory - 256 MB DDR 3200 Video - 128 MB DDR nVidia GeForce 5200 FX HDD - Western Digital 40 Gig Hard Drive with 2 MB cache at 7200 RPM CDROM - Toshiba 12x CDROM (had to scrounge a working one up) Audio - Integrated (ehh oh well)  The best thing about this is that it all cost under $300!  I get $10 back on my dance pad and my $30 back on my hard drive, so I have to see what I'll be doing next.  I'm gonna go tune this sweet machine and load my other 300 billion games on it.  -Signoff-

      LIVE FROM ARIZONA!  Thats right, I'm in Arizona right now.  To be exact, I'm sitting in a Hampton Inn on their public access computer unit.  It's got great internet connection, but its horrible for anything else.  It has a 475 Mhz Celeron and built in Intel chipset.  Which equals crap.  Anyways, so far its been raining out here, which sucks alot.  Its wet and cold, and they have a jacuzzi I want to go into.  Boooooo.  Oh well, so far life on the road/in a different state is pretty boring.  Overall, I'm bored.  So I'm sitting on here typing and talking to other people.  Woo.  Okay, well...I'm taking random pictures among with other things.  Well...I'm bored so.....bye.

      Oh my god I'm actually posting stuff withing a decent time from my last post!  UN-BE-FREAKIN-LIEVEABLE!  Meh....Yah, my friend pushed me into doing it.  No really, she did.  She held a gun to my head and told me if I don't type that an alien spaceship was going to land on Mars and kick the crap out of our rovers, I'd die....  Okay not really, but I'm doing this post because my friend kinda told me to post.  And plus she's super awesome cool because she plays DDR.  Anyways, its been amazingly boring in the past few days.  I did some homework, and....slept.  And slept some more.  Then I got random stuff for my jacket and put it on.  My jacket is like, almost done.  (See- almost out of space)  So that's cool.  I have a bunch of room on the back, but..meh.  I dunno.  Anyways...yah I learned my friend plays DDR.  Which is cool.  Because...not many people play DDR anymore out here.  So yaay for her and playing DDR!  Yaay.  Too bad I like haven't seen her in like...Forever..and ever.  She's cool.  In other news (like theres much to talk about).  Umm...yah.  Oh...I HATE THE FREAKIN' RAIN!  Damn I hate it.  With like...a passion.  Just like I  hate getting wet on water rides.  Seriously.  Take Perilous Plunge at KBF.  If wanted to get  that  wet, I'd take a shower, and at least the shower water would be clean!  Can't say the same for the Plunge water.  Ew.  But the Log Ride is pretty cool...you don't get that wet.  Okay I seriously have nothing else to say right now.  ......still nothing.  So...bye.

      Wow, didn't post for awhile....bet you all thought I died.  WRONG!  Anyways, I never did end up going to Knott's, just ended up stopping by the McDonald's with the locked DDR 8th Mix machine with my family since they were hungry.  I wasted about 5 bucks playing.  And then I kinda didn't do much for awhile.  I did update my site in the meantime though, with what me and my friends would look like if we were in South Park.  Pretty cool, check it out.  Anyways, so I did go somewhere.  I went to Disneyland.  Wasn't bad.  Though everything was like closed.  I went on Haunted Mansion and PotC mostly.  Did some other rides but yah....  I did somehow end up in Tomorrowland (nothing-is-open land) and rode the Autopia.  Which I will  NEVER  do again.  Ever.  It was like the 405...except like..worse.  Anyways, I decided to play some DDR while I was there, since Disneyland's 8th Mix machine is fully unlocked.  Played Sakura on standard for the first time...and passed it with a B!  So my skill level is now 8 feet (which is Exorbititant, or something).  So that's cool.  I'm still kinda sore from it.  I tried playing Blonde Girl on heavy RIGHT after it, and failed miserably....I was sooo tired after that.  But I ended up playin Sakura 6 more times that day...and I didn't bar rape.  Hahahaha I rock [\sarcasm].  But yah...some other players showed up too, so we talked...they've been playing for 2 years and were pretty amazed that I'm up to 8 feet in 5 months.  And then there were some "townies" which ugh...I can't stand.  And some stupid kid thought he could shadow me without asking.  Wrong.  And then I had some girls who wanted to take pics of me while I played...that was kinda fun.  I don't know  why  they wanted to take photos, but hey, who knows.  Lots of people gathered round to watch me play Sakura...I might have to take that song up as my next song to dance whore.....  Anyways..tired.  So...bye.

      Today is good.  Very good.  The DMV gods smiled upon me and gave me my California ID that I applied for/ordered in October.  YAAAY!  Too bad my signature looks like total crap though, and I look like...not me..or something.  But whatever.  I finally freakin got it!  Holy crap!  I've never been so excited over a stupid piece of plastic in my entire life!  Anyways tomarrow is no fun and games day.  I get locked up in a room for 4-5 hours and am forced to do tests until I die of bordem.  See-Exit Exams.  Even though I'm in 11th grade, they still want me to take them I guess.  But I dont' want to.  Ever.  As a matter of fact, I ditched last year in my Sophmore year so I wouldn't have to take them!  But oh well...tomorrow will suck, and then Wed will too, because I get to do it all over again.  Though I do get to buy my Solace ticket...I think.  But whatever.  If I don't do it on Wed, then I'll probably go on Thursday.  It'll give me an excuse to walk down to McDonald's and play their DDR Extreme machine.  (WHY DID THEY LOCK THE SONGS!?  DIE!)  And maybe I'll play the 3rd Mix machines down at the Boardwalk...and ride Supreme Scream...yah.  Okay...well now that I've told you all about my secret plans...I'll have to go make new ones...with my new ID card....(heh heh heh....)  That and I'm hungry so...bye.

      Its 2AM...do you know when you last posted in your blog?  Okay I need to square something away first.  I JUST FOUND THIS!  It's so great....wrong in so many ways...yet hilarious.   urlLink The International Rules of a Farting Competition .  Yes...you saw correctly.  Rules for a farting competition.  Anywho, its 2AM...2 of my friends are online still, which is cool, since usually everyones dead asleep by now.  But not me!  Well..soon enough.  Anyways, Superbowl is tomarrow.  BFD.  I won't even be watching it because I think it's stupid.  I was going to go to Disneyland again...but I'm not going to wear that place out.  It's good for a few visits every once in a while.  Instead I'll probably be sleeping all day, or something.  But yah...No Stupidbowl for me.  And I get to hit Knott's soon so I can get that Solace ticket I need to get so I can go in at freakin 5 AM or something to ride rides.  Which is insane.  There's no way in hell I'm gonna get up in time.  But thats at a later time, I'm not bitching about that yet.  I saw some pictures my friend took today.  She rocks at photography.  Seriously, she rocks, and will always rock, forever and ever and ever.  Reminded me I needed to take some shots of Haunted Mansion soon, my other ones are way out of date.  And, I feel like it.  Okay yah....well, okay I guess I'll bitch about this new month.  It blows.  Seriously just...it needs to be done with already.  And then it'll be March....which isn't that much better, since then that's Solace time, where I get to put up with those 3,000 lb ACEr's.  And all they talk about is rides.  It's so bad!  But all will be made up when I get to like ride rides at freakin 7AM.  Nothing better than riding Montezooma's in the front at 7AM.  Seriously, it rocks.  But yah, I'm more into Supreme Scream than other rides.  That ride is just cool.  And I guess this year they're doing like...ERT on the Log Ride and the Mine Ride....wow...I can see that now...4000 lb boats running at like 2 mph breaking the flume and shooting water everywhere.  And the mine trains will probably derail because of fatness.  Ugh..I'm shuddering at the thoughts of it already.  Well, since I'm a bitch today...I'm done...so...bye.

      Wow I'm back...and..um..yah.  Anyways, after a drought of no posting, I decided to come back and tell you, the viewer(s), whats going on....  My life's kinda gone through some intersting-ness.  After being single for like....3 weeks..or maybe more, I didn't keep track...  Anyways, after being single for awhile, turns out someone likes me!  Woo!  I ask her out, and it's been a great relationship so far.  She's too perfect.  I swear, she's just too perfect.  So cute too.  ^_^  I get to see her this Thursday, which rocks amazingly hard.  I love her.   Haven't been to Knott's since Solace...and proud of it!  Solace left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth.  It wasn't anyones fault either..its just how everything kinda happened.  During the morning everything was great.  During the mid-day...ehh not bad.  The meet-ups I did were great, and the DDR meet was fun, but....meh.  Night-time just wasn't all that fun.  I ended up sitting in the bar with a few friends.  Doubt I'll be going to Knott's anytime soon either, especially with all these spring breakers about ::shudder::.  But that can always change....  Probably will end up going to Disneyland sometime soon though....Indy re-opens...which rocks.  First re-hab that thing got in 10 years...which is like...freakin amazing.  Mansion's second elevator returns, which equals increased capacity...thank freakin' god.  Meh, enough with the themepark stuff.  Anyways, yah....I'm taken again....its so great! ^_^  She's just about the greatest thing to happen to my life in like almost forever.    Anyways, history homework = suckiness....so....bye.

      Wow, yesterday sucked, and today sucks also.  I've had to put up with stupid people for awhile now.  My most recent bitching goes as follows.  To all kids who IM me just to bug me or say stupid stuff and block me:  You guys are all fucking assholes.  Seriously, don't come out and start bein all nice and then turn into a bitch and be like "Oh my b/f doesn't like that blah blah blah."  Because guess what? I COULD GIVE A FUCK LESS ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND!  For all I care, I hope he gets hit by a truck, then a steamroller, and then swept up by a streetcleaner.  And don't judge me either.  Ever hear the saying, "Labels are for soupcans," hm?  Because I'm pretty damn sure I'm not a soupcan.  So don't label me.  And BFD that you blocked me, I could seriously care less about someone blocking me.  I'm not going to sink to your level and start IMing you back and shit, because I seriously could care less about you.  I never met you, and hopefully, I never will.  And if I do, I'll probably stab you with a spork, or at least knock you in the head.  Just leave me the fuck alone you annoying little bitch(es)!  You know who you are, and you damn better not IM me again!  [/rant]  Okay, in other news....I got this cool little signature thingy off this cool site!  The thing shows all my little vitals when I'm signed on my interenet dealie thing.  Click the thing to learn more about it.  If it says something like "The system is down" or something, it means I'm offline, but you can still click it...I put it at the bottom of my site now, yaay!  Okay so as I was saying, I've been putting up with mass amounts of stupidity lately.  Disneyland, home, just about everywhere.  So we went to Chili's last night, and there was like a 30 minute wait.  More stupidity?  Ugh.  At this point, I was  not  in a social/people mood.  If someone was to come up to me, and insult me in any way shape or form, I probably would've tried to slit their throat, and watch them die while laughing.  Yes, I was  that  pissed off at everything/one.  Luckily, nothing happened.  So we go home, on the way home, my sister/family decides to start arguing.  At this point I told them to go fuck themselves, and went into my room.  And thats where I've been.  Anyways, had a fun chat with a friend of mine, which lasted for awhile, and then had some boringness.  Then this bitch IMs me and was all friendly, but then turned into a snobby little shit.  Needless to say, I hope she burns in hell (not too close to me though).  Damn bitch.  Well, thats about it for me, I'm done....so...bye.

      Meh, I got bored today, and went over to  urlLink This Rollercoaster Accident Site Thingy  and read the funniest headline ever...   Girl, 6, thrown from Sizzler, injured   Anyways, it made me think of the restaurant, and I then started writing up my own article....Here's the result..    Girl, 6, thrown from Sizzler, Injured   	Six year old Jamie Forester was thrown from a Sizzler last Saturday.  As of this time, investigators are unsure as of what actually caused the ejection.  The Sizzler, opened May 10th, 1998, seems to be in working condition, and hasn't had any reported problems. Several eye-witnesses saw the little girl tossed from the Sizzler, and say it was her fault.  	"She only tipped the waitress 2 dollars," says Arnold Weight, an eye witness, "she should have tipped her at least 4, she was under the gratuity percentage."  	Other witnesses say a piece of cheese bread was at fault for her being thrown from the Sizzler.  DOSH has requested the Sizzler to stop the sale of all cheese bread until they can inspect it for any faults that may have lead to the ejection.  	The family has not released any information of legal charges they may be pursuing at this time.  The Sizzler remains open, selling quality meals at reasonable prices.

        Dirt, mud, dust- you don't care, as long as you can roll in it!    urlLink   What random GIR quote are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Yah, take this always fun and oh-so-random quiz to see what you are...  Weeee.  Anyways, nothing going on as of this moment...yet.  Everythings all boring and not fun.  Hopefully tomorrow proves more interesting.  I went to Disneyland the other day, and I will never go on a Friday again.  Though it was fun.  I went on Pirates about 6 or 7 times.  AND...Big Thunder Mountain Derailroad.  It's actually kinda fun.  They've slowed it down a bit thanks to the braking and such, and they removed one set of the wheel assemblies.  But yeah...nothing to report...  So...bye.  PS  You all will eventually see my Arizona photos...I'm in the process of loading them up...should be up any time now!

      Ugh, well.  Arizona was a total failure.  I was stuck with an entire soccer team of really immature girls who do stupid things.  Stupider than me.  Anyways.  Noteworthy things in Arizona were....  Gas is really freakin expensive It rained It was really freakin cold It got sunny It was still cold Our hotel was really cool The kids on the team were stupid Some kids got stuck in an elevator after an e-stop  (HAHAHAH!) I took random pictures and most of them turned out Food was good Mexican food is always good  Its about a 7-8 hour drive out so I had to be shoved into some car and sit in there for the whole drive which sucked.  On the way home we stopped at some casino and it sucked because we had no more gas money after we gambled.  The drive home was much more tolerable than the drive up.  Mainly because right when I got home I slept.  Anyways, pics will be up soon.  I'm happy as a clam to be back home, but...I'm kinda hungry and pissed off.  So...bye.

Anyways, I actually kinda have a job now, and...I'm doing good at it.  And I don't have to leave the home!  Yah...I take care of our yards and stuff.  Lame, but hey it pays.

      Okay wow.  I was so freakin' stupid.  I sometimes say people are "blind."  What I mean by blind is that you're not seeing it from anyone else's point of view.  I figured out recently that I was blind, and it sucked.  Just...wow.  Thankfully I've resolved everything with her, and I've found we're more alike than we knew..But I was so blind, only because I didn't want something to happen.  Turns out it was the same for her.  Now everything's fixed.  But being blind when you don't know it, its so horrible.  But thankfully, we told each other, and..wow...So much relief now.  Anyways, just thought I'd share it all with you.  Try not to be blind.  I always try to view it from everyone's point of view, but sometimes, its ridiculously hard.  But..we're back together, and all is good. ^_^  And sadly I have no catchy signoff piece so...bye.

      Oh god best DDR night of my life. Found a nickel arcade that had an Extreme (recently upgraded). Walk up, 6 nickels per play (not bad...) Put in 2 nickels, and found out someone lowered the credit intake to two nickels (10 cents for 3 stages, mmmm). Anyways, best DDR night of my life... I passed Ska A Go Go, Kamukei, Tsugaru, Tsugaru Apple Mix, Saints Go Marching In, and Orion 78 Amero Mix on heavy (9 footers).  My cata count is now up to 8. Sweetness.  Catas passed: Break Down Dead End Ska A Go Go Kamukei Tsugaru Tsugaru Apple Mix Saints Go Marching In Orion 78 Amero Mix  10 footer passed Bag Sakura  All in 7 months.  Shit, thats good.

      Hm, special post today folks, this post is dedicated to two "acquaintances" that I once knew.  Here it goes.  Dear "friends (and I use that term  very  loosely),"  Its a shame you don't know me that well.  I put on facades with people, just to see how they'll react.  Sadly, you two are a very shallow breed.  I wish you both a nice stay in hell.  People like yourselves are a curse to this earth.  If you actually would've taken the time to know me, you would've realized that was a facade I put on to humour myself with you two.  But, since you were shallow, it looks like it doesn't matter.  You both, are horrible people.  Rot in hell.  You mother fucking piles of shit.  Hopefully someday, you'll learn that toying with people's emotions have dire consequences.  (Hopefully you'll learn that by force...It'd be the only way to knock some sense into your thick skulls.)  People are not personal toys for you to fuck with.  Hopefully, someday, someone will be able to do this to you.  If I ever hear word of it.  I applaud whoever fucked you over royally.  Emotion is a very dangerous thing.  Sadly, you two probably won't understand this, being you have an IQ of possibly a fruit fly.  But, in closing.  Fuck you.  Fuck you both.  Rot in hell, you mother fucking piles of shit.  Forever and always,                    Patrick

      Wow, amazing.  Xcelerator still isn't open.  Knott's is fucking retarded.  I'm not renewing my pass there.  Fucking bastards aren't getting a cent out of me.  Erm, in other news, family is in "vacation" mode now.  All but me of course, I'm taking psychology in my I.S. class right now.  Maybe I can finally figure out what the fuck is wrong with everyone. =P  But yeah, really, nothing going on.  More crap being dished out about how unsafe rides are, and stupidity reigns.  I'm waiting till the day we have to walk around with giant helmets on.  I will then rip out my heart, and eat it.  And yes, you heard me.  Not renewing my pass to Knott's.  Not worth it.  The only good thing about Knott's is Halloween Haunt.  Don't need a year round pass for that.  Just hop in during October.  Plus I still have my Disneyland Resort pass.  Disney is about oh, four billion times better than Knott's now anyway.  So I'm shifting over to Disneyland.  Not only do they have better rides, their arcades are in better condition also.  Which is always a plus.  And from what I hear.  Xcelerator will receive a MAJOR modification to the ride vehicles.  I'm roughly guessing 4-Point restraints, but I'm not too sure.  Either way, it looks like this Tuesday will be my last "annual pass" visit there.  I'm tired of their shitty Guest Relations, and I'm tired of their BS, bad planning, and other mis-haps that happen.  Hell, I'm not even sure I'm going to Solace this next year.  And if I do, its going to cost me $40 instead of $20.  Oh well.  And as I said before, I really only go during Halloween Haunt.  Yes, I do go other times, but I'm not half as interested in whats going on then.  I slink around and do nothing.  Thats why I'm ditching the pass.  Hopefully my renewal money can be put towards something a bit better than that crap.  I've also blow out 4 BIOS chips today.  Bye computer parts. =)  Haha.  Well, thats about it for now.  Bye Knott's, you were a decent park, but now you just suck.

      Yaay Super Ultra Bitch Rant time!  Okay...so you've all heard about the death on Superman Ride Of Steel.  Well its made its way to California!  Lemmie show you...   State investigators Tuesday asked Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain to each shut down one roller coaster equipped with a restraint system that has been the focus of investigations in two recent fatal accidents out of state.  Both parks said they would comply with the request, which comes as amusement parks enter their peak season. State officials said it is the first time they have requested safety improvements based on accidents outside California.  With those cases in mind, officials from the California Department of Occupational Safety and Health on Tuesday asked Knott's Berry Farm to close Xcelerator and asked Six Flags Magic Mountain to close Superman: The Escape until fixes can be made.  "We've asked them to modify the restraint systems to enhance the safety of the rides and keep the rides closed until modifications are made," said department spokesman Dean Fryer.   In the past, the state has ordered changes only on rides that had accidents.   Fryer said state investigators have not issued an official order to shut down the two attractions because the parks agreed to comply. Both parks previously had said the equipment was safe and that the rides did not need to close.  Six Flags officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon. The company has said it has begun changing restraints on some of its other attractions, including the Superman roller coaster in Massachusetts.  Susan Tierney, a Knott's spokeswoman, said the park voluntarily closed the Xcelerator coaster while park officials decide what to do. It's unclear when the ride will reopen, she said.   O-kay.  Yup.  Because we all know that Xcelerator and Superman:  The Escape have  horrible  track records.  I mean, look how many people have died on them!  Oh wait... NOBODY HAS!   Seriously, why the fuck do we need to go and change something when it's doing just fine.  Hell, I've felt safer on Xcelerator than Jaguar!  I really love how overly safe we are.  God knows that we can't  BLAME THE RIDER  for what they did.  Oh no, it HAS to be because the ride or the park did something wrong.  God forbid the person was a fucking idiot.  Nope, because if we admitted that, OSHA/DOSH would be out of a job.  Here guys, come and fuck up our rides.  Lets make them overly zealous when it  comes to safety!  Even though they haven't killed anyone, lets go ahead and make it super ultra not fun and safe.  Hell while were at it, I think Knott's should take even  FURTHER  initiative and do some more modifications...  Rollcages on Timber Mountain Log Ride:  God knows the logs could magically roll over and kill EVERYONE on board.  Over The Shoulder Restraints (OTSRs) on Kingdom of the Dinosaurs:  Safety is everything here, who knows when someone could be dragged under the amazingly fast 1/2 mph moving vehicles.  OTSRs on Jaguar:  Oh those banked turns are so dangerous.  Who knows when someone could fly out!  Roll Cages and OTSRs on Calico Mine Ride:  Those trains are sure old and dangerous, lets make sure nobody falls out and is dragged under.  Wheeler Dealer Bumper Car speed reduction:  That 1/4 mph speed right now is just TOO fast.  Lets knock it down to 1/12 mph.  Safety Cages on Supreme Scream:  Just in case you suddenly fall out, you'll land in the safety cage.  Spin reduction on Hat Dance:  Those lateral G's are just  begging  to toss someone out.  Lets stop it completely.  La Revolucion swing/spin reduction:  Oh no!  Someone could surely fall out!  Lets make it swing 10 feet up in the air and have it spin at 1/2 RPM.  OTSRs on benches and chairs:  Who knows when you might fall out while feeding your god damn fat face!  Ugh..anyway.  In closing.  Fuck DOSH/OSHA.  Fuck KBF.  Fuck SFMM.  Fuck fuck fuck DOSH/OSHA.  Fucking bastards.

      Hello again everybody.  Well, my construction on a personal Stepmania machine has begun.  I went to Fry's and checked out some mobos and other such hardware.  It sucked.  Everythign was overpriced and very sub-par.  Recently, Fry's started selling DDR stuff, including DDR pads.  For all you DDR freaks out there...  Turns out they have a similar metal arcade pad. I tried this thing out, and found out it sucked  royally .  I tried playing Tsugaru, and the back arrow, along with the up arrow barely responded. The left and right arrows were warped, and the arcade bar fell off while I was playing. Oh, I also failed. (Its a sad day in DDR when you pass "Dream A Dream" and it says "Its a new record" when you have a D...)  Anyways, tried playing Twilight Zone RC Extended Club Remix on heavy. The gallop/16th steps make the first 40 or so seconds pretty irregular. When dealing with this, people usually tend to have a "hard rhythm" going. (You're stepping out a more forceful beat...) Some dude says I better quit "stomping" on the pad. (Oh I'm sorry, would you like me to play with my hands?) I told him that nobody would have to stomp if the pad didn't suck so much. Anyways,  DO NOT  buy this pad. Its a waste of $300. A family that was looking into a new DDR pad took notice at how disgusted I was with the pad and didn't buy it. In your face Fry's. Damn jerks.  Moral-Don't sell stuff that sucks ass.  Because I'm going to come and make sure that people don't get ripped off you bastards.
