       Current Mood:  tired, excited    Current Music:  Shallow Sleep... dunno the artist... it Japanese, though!     YAY!  band camp was extensively fun today!  WHEE HEE HEE!!!!  Anyways, I got home from the exhausting excitement, and I worked on my comic!  YAY!  I am extremely pleased with how awesome it looks... I didn't know that I could draw that good......... There must've been some kind of talent "sleeping within me"... like the power of Dios!!! BWAHAHA!  (Utena reference)  Finally, I am nearly done with the second draft.  All that is left to do is the third draft, basically inking, and then the tone... then comes inserting the typed words............ fun!  It's gonna take a lot of work and time, so I hope I can put in some serious time each night so I can finish it by the deadline... and do it well, leaving time for summer reading....... "cheers"... **coughcough**    Well, I bet you're wondering... with all this exciting, cheerful stuff, I must have a perfect life, right?  WRONG!  Today at band camp... (I sound like that one girl from American Pie... tee hee!)  Anywayz, I saw my ex-crush at band camp.  I'm really not sure if I still have feelings for him... doubt it.  (He's the one who took me to Winter Formal and completely ignored me, breaking my heart in the process.  dork.) I was excited to see him, since he is kinda incredibly cute, and I hadn't seen him in a long time.... although he can be severely annoying at times.  Well, yeah.  We were out on the field, practicing formations, and the teacher was going over the movements by squads, so the rest of us just kinda plopped ourselves on the sidelines.  I sat by Allison... the incredibly awesome Sophomore.  From sitting there, I got an incredibly angering view of my ex-crush laying his head on this one girl's lap.  IT ANGERS ME!  Practically all of the band guys hang on her, and she already has a boyfriend!  I mean, she's not a playa or anything... she's really nice, as a matter of fact... it just annoys the heck out of me that my ex-crush hangs on her, too... I mean, if you like her, just GET OVER IT!  She has a boyfriend!!!!!  BLAHRG!   Sorry, it just really makes me mad.  I'm not in love with him or anything, it just annoys me that he really doesn't pay attention to me, even after we've been to a dance together, and supposedly, we're "friends forever"...   men.  There's no such things as them in my world... well, maybe there's a few "men", but I don't know..................    Maybe if some of the guys would see my drawings, hear my viola playing, or hang around with me more, I would attract a good person out of the bunch... perhaps reel in a "man"..........     but who knows?  I mean, they're guys, after all!    ##eien watashi

       Current Mood:  charged; excited!      Current Music:  Japan/Korea, "Let's Get Together"     BWEE HEE HEE!!! Tonight was the first session of BAND CAMP! WOO-HOO! It was soooo much fun! We played through the halftime shows, which have fun snare drum parts, and then we went out onto the football field and practiced different marching tactics... we had a blast, especially when we would make stupid mistakes on the field... we laughed our heads off! And the best part (well, maybe...) was when we were coming back to the band room, we crossed the field where the football team was practicing... and I saw John! He looked so cute, with his hair messed up like that! tee hee!! He said hi to me, and then yelled my name as I was walking away... it could have been just because his friends were there..... but hey! who knows?     Today, at work, I took quite a few ticket orders... many of the credit cards or adresses or phone numbers had the numbers 2632 in them... in that order. This is the address of my old crush, the one who I really liked for 2 years or so, then he asked me to winter formal... it was poopy.......... but yeah... wonder if it's a sign, or if I'm just dreaming.................    I hope I see John again soon....................................... and that maybe he's serious when he says hi.    ##eien watashi

Yeah, Band Camp starts tomorrow, and accelerates next week... and I just got done playing an extremely rough game of trivial pursuit... yeah. I lost. woo-hoo.

       Current Mood:  Content.  Current Music:  Um... Seiko Matsuda................   Today was percussion sectional at school!  YAY!  I got to play the snare drum!  TEE HEE!  My roll is really coming along.  It was so fun, because the section sounded totally awesome, and we're probably going to be one of the coolest sections in the marching band!  We're REALLY hyper... well, except for Steve and Samantha, anyways... Krista n I are pretty much the reeeeeeally hyper ones... Yeah.  We almost finished cleaning the library.  The cabinets are labeled, and the only thing that we really have to do is file some pep band scores and random music.  EXCITING!  Then I had my viola lesson, and did reeeeeeeeeeally good!  YAY!  Then, I get to go to a party tomorrow, and Saturday!  BWEE HEE HEE!!!!!!!!    Well, I was reading my Bible last night... (for like the first time in a reeally long time ^^;) I was cruising in Song of Solomon.  I found this verse... it is soo inspiring.  "Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the swift gazelles and the deer of the wild, not to awaken love until the time is right." (Song of Solomon 3:5)  Yeah.  This verse really caught my attention.  This really tells me that the time isn't right, at least now, anyways.  God will know when the time is right!     Yeah.  I'm addicted to Asiago Cheese Bagels from Panera.  Even if they are low-carb, I loooooooooove asiago cheese bread, and they are sooooooooooooo good!  Well, g2g work on my comic now... the deadline approaches... I can see its sharp teeth... eep!  ##eien watashi

       Current Mood:  hungry........ blah  Current Music:  Seiko Matsuda... again.   At Bible Study tonight, a couple came in to talk about their relationship.  They took things extremely slow, and didn't even kiss until they were engaged!  Anyways, the guy said that it doesn't mean that God doesn't want something for you just because you don't have it.  This peeked my interest.  Maybe I will eventually have a boyfriend, like, next year... why sulk about it now... I mean, I can still be a dreamer and not sulk!  But yeah... that was so cool, the way he just talked about being at peace with God's will... it's not strict or painful, God's will is peaceful and right for you!  Well...  I got to thinking... maybe being single isn't that bad.  Besides, who wants to go out with some guy just for the heck of it?  I mean, come on.  People like that make me extremely sick.  I'd rather have crushes that aren't returned... at least until my dream destiny guy comes around (like the couple shared tonight)... I mean, at least it makes my life somewhat interesting, eh?  Well, maybe not... maybe a little too "teen drama-normalcy"... oh well... I'm me, right, God?  TEE HEE!  ##eien watashi

       Current Mood:  depressed.......  Current Music:  Seiko Matsuda's "Missing You"  (how appropriate........)   too true.    You have a heartsick soul! Youre the type of girl who always has a crush and is writing their name on all your books. You are a hopeless romantic. Waiting for that prince charming, you take love seriously, but still play any chance you get. You can have a lot if boys who are friends, but waiting for that perfect boyfriend. Sometimes you are discouraged because there are no sparks but even if the smallest thing happens, youre on Cloud 9.  You believe in true love and wait for it. Just dont be afraid to take a chance. Love is all about risks.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Gosh.  I miss Josh.   (I made a rhymey!)  Anyways, I really do.  He used to be in my orchestra, but he left a few years ago.  I really do miss him.  He was probably the first boy I had an actual crush on... it's just one of those things... can feelings really last through separation like this?  Who knows!  I wonder if God will let us meet again someday... gosh.  I really do miss him so... all I can do is sit here in my blog and weep, the pathetic dreamer that I am.  darnit.  All of those Saturday meetings, and growth of feelings... for what?  NOTHING!  I HATE THIS!!!!!!!  (sorry for the temporary rage)  but, I really do miss him!  *cry*  gosh.  I'm pathetic.

Some girl at school told me that he thought about me from time to time.  Then we were sitting there at Homecoming dance, talking... he said that he was a good cook, I said I was terrible... blah blah blah........ then, he laughed, like I was actually fun to be with!  The, he offered me his hand, and invited me to dance!  I took his hand, and we danced, reeeeally close.  You could tell from the dream that he liked me... but I hope it's true in real life... I woke up then, unfortunately.............. I just wrote a poem about it... it's on my http://poetry.tetto.org/~watashi/ website... it's called "May we meet again, Love."  I like it... dunno how it is, though............ wow, I'm using a lot of "dots", I guess you would call em... ^^; oh well.

Anyways, I miss everyone over the summer... especially since I don't really have a crush....... but I kinda do....... but I never see him anyways!  ;__;  I hate guys!  (though, there's probably a few good ones out there....)  They give you signs, then go and give other girls signs, then they ask you to a dance with them, and basically ignore you!  THEY'RE SUCH IDIOTIC DORKS!!!!!  I wish I could hook one that isn't an idiotic dork..... I mean, by the time you're a junior in high school, you should have had at least one boyfriend... probably the one that you will marry, maybe........ but NO.  Is that so much to ask, God?  Is it really?  I want a guy to be by my side for the rest of my life by the time I'm seventeen!!!!!!!!    ##eien watashi

       Current Mood:  neutral, I guess........ slightly sad.............    Current Music:  silence, except for the faint hum of the oscillating fan   We had the Band retreat last friday... it was fun, I guess! We played on the muddy football field at the campground, played cards during break, then went on a hike during the recreational time. We were laying on the grass playing tongues. I was sitting next to my friend, who plays the flute (she's one year older than me... maybe two... dunno....... she's one grade up.), and sitting next to her was my ex-crush, the flirt-a-holic. Yeah. We were laughing hysterically at something, and he was laughing so hard, and was putting his head on my friend's shoulder, and was also hanging around her while we were hiking. Okay, now. GET A LIFE. It just burns angerfully within my heart when he does things like that. I mean, he emails me these "friends forever" forwards. But... are we really? If we are, we should hang around like best friends do!  Missing my orchestra crush... haven't seen him in over a year! Hope he comes back this year... if not for first semester, for the second... or at least a concert! I'd really like to see him again!! WAAAH!  Then, at band rehearsal, the football team was on the field, and they were watching us! Even John was looking at us! (probably not at me, but I can dream, can't I?)  ##eien watashi
