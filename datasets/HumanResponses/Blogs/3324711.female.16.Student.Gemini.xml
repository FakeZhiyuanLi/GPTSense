      There's so many songs about saying goodbye, leaving, missing you.. its pathetic really. Honestly, these people should just move on with their lives. But who am I to talk, its a week, a funking week..168 hours :| feeling very much like a dork.  And Im contemplating whether or not I should go to Jillians party.. but its 9:00[ish] already and Id have to walk both ways. So Im thinking no... but Im sure theyre all having lots of fun without me. I kinda feel like being alone anyway.  And I miss Lydia. I think Im going to kidnap her and take her hostage for a while so that she cant leave, because I honestly havent done anything outside of school with her for too long. wayy too long. And since Operation HPB is well under way, I think Ill make a new one.. Operation Steal-Lydia-so-she-cant-leave-anymore. Anyone want in?   Listening To: Battle of Who Could Care Less- Ben Folds  [ahh Lauren I just did it again!!!]   Do you not hear me anymore I know it's cool to be so bored I know it's not your thing to care But it sucks me in when you're aloof It sucks me in, it sucks it works I guess it's cool to be alone Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who  Could care less Everyday you wake up late Sometimes I wish I was that way   My guitar is calling, as is my front porch. I think that chocolate upstairs is too. Night

      I actually woke up early for work so I have a couple of minutes to post before I go.. Well lets see whats the line up for today.. working, then to band practice with lauren :D possibly hopefully something with behn, and then go to bed early because I am dead tired. "and I look like shit without my makeup on... didnt I? you can say it, I looked like shit! Because I did.."  hahahha. I wont explain that one. Anyway so today will be the last day that I see behn for a week [and a day].. I know its not actually that long but we're really used to seeing each other, well, almost everyday. So itll be weird.. and Ill miss him, but its not that long right?.. right?   I wish Tyler was here to give me the old "when I was going out with [insert random girl name here], we only saw each other twice a month because she went to a different school than I did, its only a week and youd better not get all mopey because I will come and kick your ASS." talk. haha tyler I miss you, in a cousinly sort of way.  Well Behn if your reading this, if you ever get near to a computer when your gone, you can always come here to my blog and read about how much I miss you.. or Ill probably end up writing you sappy letters that start with "Dearest Behn..."  ...Ill try not to though. Man Im weird.

      well lets see, whats new today.. Im still rocking as much as I was yesterday, and I believe Operation HPB is going smoothly [Im such a loser.] Anyway today was an amazing day.. the whole morning/afternoon in school went by quickly, I did swicked on my Ancient History test, gym class was excellent [sub+hot hot heat], and I basically spent the remainder of the day with Behn. Did I ever mention that Im lucky as hell, because I am. And I know it, so dont go saying Im not thankful. Because I am, very.  Anyway so I just walked behn halfway home and we kind of had our long goodbye today since hes going away on his band trip next week, and we may or may not see each other tomarrow [hopefully yes]. Hes leaving sunday am  very  early and coming home next sunday, again with the earliness. Anyway I have to work tomarrow so Ill post again in the near future..   Lydia I guess your gone already :S but if you get this I miss you terribly. I never see you anymore and it sucks. I think its past time we got together over icecream :D  Lauren Ill call you when I get home from work about practice! you too Behn :)

      did I mention that I fucking rule? Lauren you owe me one.. Cory I love you.. Im awesome. Band practice saturday afternoon here we come!  Anyway what a great night, a whole lot better than last but whatever. Im so excited about this whole thing and yes, Im a huge dork. thats just me, so youll have to accept it.. or you could always just stop reading. Its all up to you. Im not sure if tomarrow will be quite such an eventful day but hopefully it will be. Gym tomarrow Lauren, whoop! Tyler if your reading this, you should write more in your blog because it makes me laugh. I love it.  Plus Im wearing my band sweater tomarrow.. it is so comfy, you dont understand, unless you have one of your own of course. If you come up to me asking about the fuzziness of it, I will understand completely and let you feel it.. mmm fuzzy. It would have been so much better if we got black sweaters with white writing.. classy. but meh, they rock anyway. Way to conform morgan..

      another great day.. life is wonderful. Actually, if I wasnt me, Id be annoyed as hell at me, because Im being so happy and such. So if you dont like me being this happy maybe you should stop reading, because morgans emo days are over! [for now]  Anyway, we got our band sweaters today! Im not usually one for school spirit or anything but I used to wear my brothers everyday, and you all know how crappy and beat up it got. It was my favourite sweater, and then my mom threw it out [this she denies but I know the truth.] But all that is over and done with because I finally got my own! Did I mention that life is amazing?  Speaking of amazing, I went to Behns after school today and we walked around aimlessly, and went to go visit ricky and debbie!! [kathryn hoods parents.. they love me dearly]. It was awesome, I miss them so much.. this all brings back so much memories. Plus just being with Behn made my day :) hes stellar. And going away on a band trip this sunday.. which blows, specially since hes away for his birthday, but we're planning a huge party [well I am haha] when he gets back. I was thinking either toga party or jam party? Itll probably end up being a jam party which is awesome, but someone has to have a toga party sometime! do you realise how swickedly amazing that would be?

      what started off as a great night, isnt.   Bryce.. man I am so sorry :( I really mean that.  I forgot to call Lydia cause I went for a run with Daniel and [sort of] Matt and shes gonna be pissed at me tomarrow.. but the run was awesome. I mean Im totally out of shape and its terrible but its great to hang out with Daniel and Matt again..I forgot how much I missed them all [sniff] no Im not that emotional but theyre great.  Anyway I have nothing left to say, so goodnight.   Listening To: nothing at all.

      man I feel like a social butterfly, so many people are talking to me..Im not used to this..   well...  this is my blog.. yes Im hopping on the band wagon [is that right?] and making a blog. Im a trend whore, and how. Anyway so if your reading this than you obviously care too much but Ill try to keep you entertained as I tell about my [non]life, opinons about everything, adventures and all that jazz. Ill just start this blog off by explaining who I am:  Hi, Im morgan. I [make an attempt to] play guitar, I play in a basement band, my life= being lazy, eating, sleeping, working, music, and hanging out with friends and behn! I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, mostly rock, and some of my favourite bands are: incubus, weezer, hot hot heat, the darkness, jethro tull, blink 182, grinspoon, foo fighters...I think thats enough. Anyway thanks for reading my first post guys, talk to you later..  Lauren if your reading this oh boy is there a surprise for you tomarrow!! heh heh..

      so Im back to my usual [well since apres-emo morgan] giddy/stupid/happy self.  Behn called!! I believe it made my day.. [that and hanging upside down at lunch and watching people jump.. but thats another story.] Anyway so hes having a good time.. Well he said he was but he sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than me. But hes spent almost all of his money so if it was me Id be having a great time!! He said he got me a present :D I love presents! And hes coming home on Sunday..3 days.  Even though I didnt go kayaking [again], it was one hell of a day. I love this sunny weather.  Shit.  Note to Self : Get new jeans.  Semi is next week! I cant wait. Its gonna be so awesome.. Tyler are you still going with Ellen? Or what is the deal there? Ahh, semi. What great memories from last year.. Contemplating wearing a skirt.. leaning towards a yes. Which is very, very difficult for me. But meh, semi comes but once a lifetime. Or twice if youre awesome like me.   Everyday she wears the same thing I think she smokes pot Shes everything I want Shes everything Im not   I should run.. Wheres Daniel when I need him.. but hes so gd fast and I can never keep up. By the end of the summer, my friend.. Not really I just like to think so.  Anybody else notice how fast this week went by?

      Ok, just got home and no one is here. Its creeping me out and AHH   you . are ruining my good day and how are  you  always there? your always there and you never stop complaining or bitching about something and blaming me and I made an effort and now Im done, finished. I have nothing else to say to you. Im having a great time and Im happier than Ive ever been, and I dont want to deal with your issues anymore.   Now Im done and back to my wonderful day! The sky is blue the sun is shining, Behn is calling tonight :D and hopefully pretty early so that I can go kayaking! But if not than whatever.  And Radioland people suck because they wouldnt give me that poster.

       Summer ! Its just around the corner..one month I tell you, one month!!  What a good day! I was just outside on my deck for an hour and a half. Because it is beautiful out. But yes, what an awesome day. Free cookies, awesome band class, hokey-pokey at lunch time!! Hooray for being the special guest! I never knew you guys did that before haha.. It made my day. That and the fact that our band sub knew every Pink Floyd song on piano so me and Lauren sat there after band class, him playing piano, me singing along.. Lauren looking very amused/bewildered. It was amazing.. Then well ancient history was alright, whatever, and then I walked home with Lauren Brad and Jillian IN THE SUN!! Only Lauren will understand how amazing that was.  Anyway, so I ended up going to bed yesterday at 6:00 PM! And slept till 7 this morning. Lets count how many hours that was..13, if my math is correct [and its most likely not.]  Thats a lot of sleep. But it was good. And the whole sunniness.. ahh I love it. Now if only Behn was here, then it would be stellar.  Funniest thing in gym class.. Ennett wants me to try out for the womans touch league in the fall or something haha! Cheers for extra gym marks.. which I need since the gym exam :S haha. Anyway touch is no fun anyway, you need the whole kicking of ass and tackling and all that. Thats what football is after all. Well thats what my dad taught me :)  Cant wait for the long weekend.. but this week is actually going by pretty quickly. Wednesday already, 2 more days then work, work, and BEHN! I cant wait. And its a long weekend and everything! So I get to sleep in monday morning!!! therefore making it a good monday! AH, what a great day!! Im talking to Cory about how people should be more open minded and its making me very excited! I never use exclamation marks!  Im going outside, and you should too!

      In a very blah-ish mood right now.. I miss behn but I dont want to be all whingey and "I cant live without my boyfriend" stupid so I hope its not just that.. maybe I just need a day or two to be in a pissy mood. That and I think Im sleep deprived.. Anyway Im gonna stop complaining now.  Rant Of the Day: My favourite sex songs Has anyone ever noticed how much sex is in the music industry but its never EVER portrayed as a loving thing anymore? Its all about horniness. In my opinion, the 2 best songs about sex are In My Room by Incubus and Crash Into Me by Dave Matthews. I mean, Dave Matthews is one sick kid and the lyrics are kinda weird, but its a good song. And Incubus is just amazing. I dont think I even needed to say that but I did anyway.  Man Im totally out of it today, Im gonna quit while Im... ahead?   This party is old and uninviting, Participants all in black and white. You enter in full blown technicolor, Nothing is the same after tonight.  If the world were to fall apart, In a fiction-worthy wind, I wouldn't change a thing, Now that you're here.  Love is a verb here in my room. Yes love is a verb here in my room.  You enter and close the door behind you, Now show me the world as seen from the stars. If only the lights would dim a little, I'm wary of eyes upon my scars.  Pink tractor beam into your incision Head spinning as free as dervish's whirl. I came here expecting next to nothing, So thank you for being that kind of girl, That kind of girl

       Comes from some other beginning's end.   Well the band is over as we know it. Im not feeling very remorseful about it though because I knew it was coming..ah well maybe now we can do that rock band.. speaking of bands, my bday is coming up soon.. having a huge jam/BBQ party! Hopefully. I was thinking toga at first but that many people in togas would just be too much. We'll start at a lower number and work our way up.  My throat hurts, I shouldnt complain but Im beginning to think I have no immunities at all. Screw you Tyler for drinking that juice before I did. But it was so yummy..  Today was one of those days where your sitting in school and your there and everything, but your minds not.. and you dont feel like doing work or writing or doing anything really, and it sucked. Luckily I had 2 subs so I didnt really do anything. After school I met up with tyler, got a glass thrown at me, kicked matt out of the band, and went on an adventure that turned out to be going to see a rugby game then to carlys. Now no one can ever say I dont have school spirit! Well I dont but I went to a rugby game.. does that count for nothing? I had my sweater on and everything too..  Nevermind the fact that I sat on the Rural side..details I tell you. Im really tired so Im going to bed. That was a lie but I have nothing else to say. Night..

      Well apparently my last post was more depressing than I intended it to be.. and I knew that was coming Tyler, and I thank you for it. Congrats on the job, too.  And Matt, love, I know your not reading this, but check your fucking email. We're all getting very pissed at you right now.  But I had a fairly good day and nothing is going to spoil that, yes thats right.  Except I talked to mom, and it has been decided that me, tyler, and ryan are not going to incubus in july as planned anymore. Well I wasnt really expecting to go so Im not really angry or anything, but its still dissapointing. On the other hand, I have $ to blow on nothing. And thats a definite change for me.  Ach Im going to bed, Im dead tired.

      haha ok so I just got back from QCs semi and it wasnt actually that bad, which is halarious in my opinion. The whole going back to the "school" aka prison was interesting, but I made it good by the usual acting like an idiot. Which is always good. Anyway Im super tired, my feet hurt and I work tomarrow, life is grand..  Matt I love my corsage. Its going on my wall.

      I am in a stellar mood.  The greatest thing EVER happened yesterday, and that is that me and Behn [sorry Kara, Behn and I] found out that the old record player in my shed works, and Behn just so happened to get 20ish records for his birthday.. so we had a record party. And Im sure that this whole summer will be filled with them :) Amazing. It all put me in a mood to listen to Kiss, so Ive been listening to Love Gun and Strutter, the only songs that actually work on Kazaa. I wish I could find my Detroit Rock City ST..  I feel so disco in my new shirt, but not at the same time. I love the collar though. The collar MAKES the shirt.  Lauren, it really sounds like youre really having a bad day. Im serious when I say that you can always come crash here for a few nights or whatever.  But I am seriously really excited about this whole records thing!! This summer is definetly looking up. May just be the best summer yet.. :O  Things to Do during the summer:  - get off this gd computer. - parties [toga party/jam party/birthday party/etc] - beach - listen to records - frisbee - camping and kayaking!  What a great, great time of year. 13 days!

      Ugh. [sound of disgust]. Why is it that even though I hate this stupid piece of crap that I still stay on for hours?.. Just finished reading a book called Feed. The ending was really sad, and because I get way into books, I cried. This book made so much fucking sense I cant even begin to describe it. Its all about how much America consumes and how its going to affect people in the future. Everything in this book is fake. Their school is called SchoolTM and is run by major corporations and tells them how to control the world by knowing what theyre consuming, etc. They have fake clouds and they tore down all the trees to make air factories. In everyone's brain, they put micro chip type things that are like the internet, but inside your brain. Its called a feed and its like a constant pop up ad. It sounds annoying as hell. And everyone's skin is falling off because of the lack of real air and stuff. Yes, I am a bookworm, Yes, I am a dork. And yes, yes, I am a hippie. But please don't hold it against me.  Tired as hell but I refuse to do my homework and go to bed because Im stupid. Early band tomarrow, I may die.  On the bright side, Behn came home :):):) million smiles, and I got presents :) and me and tyler may be making a acoustic band type thing, which is cool.   Listening To:  silence. Its never quiet at my house. Those of you that have been here know.  .. its a nice change.

       = Me right now.   I hate skills. Now usually hate is a very strong word and I dont like using it, but when you have to stay up until midnight to wait for your brother to record a skill that you forgot to do, I make acceptions. And now I have to wake up early tomarrow to put on a skirt and look happy that Im in band.  Alright, Im gonna stop complaining now, because of whats happening after the band photo thinger. School is a mere 6 hours long :S and then off to see Grade 10 Girls at Peakes!   Now, those of you that dont know what/who Grade 10 Girls are, they are the most amazing band in all of.. err.. charlottetown! Maybe even PEI. [Actually Im just saying this to suck up and to score a free tshirt, but its really Tyler, Cory, Matt, and some other Cory] But anyway it should be fun. Those of you that arent doing anything tomarrow at 6pm should check it out. Anyway Im going to bed.

But it will probably have to be apres les examens. which blows. but meh.   Seize All the records from the past Hold ransom all the artifacts This ragged town protects them to the last With lies   Im expecting presents from all of you.. except you Behn, your off the hook. :)

      alright. So apparently there is this show on TV now called American something or other because all of these stupid shows  have  to be american, [not including Canadian Idol which was a total replica of American Idol.] Anyway, so this show is exactly like American Idol,  again , except this time theyre chosing the WORST singers.  I tell you, these people need to start coming up for new ideas for television shows. Plus, whats even worse it that they are encouraging these people to "sing" and carry on as if they can. The only person on it that I saw was this guy who was definetly gay, singing something by destinys child or something and was wearing half a shirt. Honestly people, this is not normal entertainment. Im very sorry to say that I had just eating when I saw this "Superstar" at work. My stomache was not the same after that. Plus think about how these people will feel after the judges tell them theyre awesome and then when they pick the worst one?? Can you spell suicide? Chances are, people that go on shows like this thinking theyre awesome have been tormented their whole lives and think this is some kind of miricle. And thats why I think this American show is disgusting. What ever happened to humanity? I guess Racism, Discrimination and just making fun of your own kind  is  the new pink, Brad.  Anyway thats enough ranting for me. Im looking at semi pictures trying to find some with me in them and no success so far, which is awesome :S thank you Jessica. Oh, theres one.

       I know, I know the sun is hot Mosquitos come suck your blood Leave you there all alone, Just skin and bone When you walk among the trees, Listening to the leaves The further I go the less I know The less I know  Where will you run? Where will you hide? Lullabies To paralyze  Fat and soft, pink and weak, Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek You know I'm told they swallow you whole, Skin and bone Cutting boards and hanging hooks, Bloody knives, cooking books Promising you won't feel a thing At all  Swallow and chew Eat you alive All of us food that hasn't died    Ive had it up to here with ancient history, but Im not as stressed as I was before. In fact Im getting to my  Wow I really dont care I just want exams to be over  stage. Which is not good when you haven't even studied half the stuff yet.  Kate that pizza was really good but I dont feel so great right now.. Istanbul, not Constantinople, Instanbul.. haha yes, I got it to work. [Sigh]..  Someone broke a string on my acoustic guitar and that does not make me happy. What does make me happy is toothpastefordinner and the fact that I found the acoustic guitar one!!!  I think my study break should've been over half an hour ago.

       It will all be over.   So I didnt get a review or anything for ancient history, which kinda blows.  What also blows is that I have to re-learn everything we've ever learned. So Im thinking I wont be doing much this weekend. But enough complaining.. Friday- study. Saturday- work, study Sunday- work, study Monday- school, study Tuesday- Exams. Wednesday- SUMMER = dreadlocks!!!!    10:11PM   Cause maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me.   just studied for hours for ancient history.. still on chapter 3. Couldnt go to tylers house which blows, but Ill be lucky to get out of this exam ALIVE. Yes I felt like being dramaish. My family has gone and left me here to fend for myself against numerous ancient civilizations and random people that are apparently special enough to be taught in schools.  Im listening to Wonderwall by Oasis because it was on the radio upstairs and it put me in the mood to listen to it. I think Ill go to bed early.. How about now?   And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I Would like to say to you But I dont know how.

       [..Gonna Dance The Night Away]   Yes, I am listening to Leo Sayer. Leave me alone, it makes me dance.  Today was such a crap day. I hate when its muggy out, because it reminds me of how many unnecessary vehicles we have on the island. Honestly people, car pooling is the way to go. And Im not one to tell others to be more energetic, but you can walk to wherever you want to go a lot of the time in half an hour.  Anyway, so it got nicer out at suppertime which is good.. That and toothpastefordinner.com and some random harry potter puppet show website that katie sent me to is just making me in a better mood. Which is great because Ive been out of it and anti-social all week, and I just keep telling you, Im done of all that!  So apparently my family is having a yardsale this weekend and didn't inform me.. Its good because I wont be here to deal with strangers wanting my old crap but I love yardsales.. so Ill be missing that. But it will be good to clean out everything in my room and get room for more, newer crap. [Packrat? Just a little.]  2 days of school left.. even though I was convinced for most of the day that today was Thursday. Well actually I guess its 2 and a half days now because I have to show up for viscom and Ill just go to english because Whitlock loves me already, why not stack up some brownies before exams right?  ... I am such a keener.  btw, check out my  urlLink viscom website

      The coutdown is coming to an end.. Exams are next week.. Half the people at my school aren't going.. The weather is getting warmer [slowly, but still..]  School is out [nonofficially] in 3 days, 2 exams next week, and then  SUMMER !  Until then, I must study. So Im off.  And so far, Im doing pretty good with the whole not-spending-as-much-time-on-the-computer-thing.    Listening To: Moby Dick- Zeppelin

      Well ladies and gentlemen, if this isnt fucking great weather, I dont know what is. And I have no idea why Im on the computer so dont ask me. Oh ya, I had a reason.. to see if Lauren was on. Well she isnt. Lauren, if/when you read this, I really really need my photo drawing stuff today haha. So Ill be up later to get it. Id call you but unfortunetly Jess is on the phone with Joey.. so she wont be off for a long long time. Which is starting to piss me off but NO I refuse to be in a bad mood.  Proof I am determained to be in a good mood: went to work at 8 when I was supposed to be there for 9. Slit my thumb open with one of the bread knives. Spilled hot coffee on my slit thumb. Worked drivethru. Found out that I wont be camping much this summer as I am working a lot of weekends... Theres more but Im done now.   ON THE BRIGHT SIDE! Im almost definetly [oxy moron thing?] getting dreads now. Turns out they dont care at work sooo its almost a yes. Now I just need to think about it for a while [as if I havent been for the past month..] and see if I REALLY want them. Because I will be putting them in myself. hahaha.. yikes.  Ach, Im getting off this stupid computer. Why must it torment me so?  Shakespeare Style.

      Ya, I know I said I wouldnt update again today, but I lied.    hahaha h'ok so.. me and Jess were at Aric's piano recital and we read this article on some random wall... I picked out my favourites cause its really long.. Behn or really any guys if you're reading this please don't be offended. Hahahha, its really sexist, but it made my day.    [Why Guitars Are Better Than Men]  Guitars never need a shave, nor do they have hair on their backs.  Guitars don't snore.  You can try out as many Guitars as you like before you get your own.  Guitars don't sneak around with other Guitars.  Guitars don't care about their performance.  Guitars don't get you pregnant.  You don't have to praise a Guitar after playing it.  Guitars don't abandon you at gatherings for more interesting players.  Guitars don't try to change you once you've bought them.  Guitars don't get jealous of your male colleagues.  Second-hand Guitars don't brag about previous owners.  Second-hand Guitars don't go to see previous owners when you're out of town.  You don't have to explain to a Guitar if you don't feel like playing tonight.  When you're lost you don't have to argue with your Guitar about stopping to ask the band for directions.  You don't have to continually assure your Guitar that its string length is just right.  Your Guitar never finishes before you do.  [hahahhahahahha!!]  Your Guitar never spends a "night out with the Guitars" and comes home with a strange rash on its fretboard.   Oh dear.. Ok now to make things fair...  [Why Guitars Are Better Than Women]  If your Guitar is flat you can fix it.  Your Guitar doesn't care if you never listen to it.  Your Guitar won't care if you leave up the toilet seat.  You can share your Guitar with your friends.  Guitars don't care how many other Guitars you've played. Guitars don't get headaches.  You can play your Guitar the first time you meet it, without having to take it to dinner, see a movie, or meet its mother.  The only protection you have to wear when playing your Guitar is a decent thumb pick.  When in mixed company, you can talk about what a great time you had the last time you played your Guitar.

Lauren good luck on your exams, even though you'll be done by the time you read this, and plus we cant fail because we're so gd hot.  And good luck to everyone who is writing exams, I feel really bad for you because it is SO NICE OUT.  This will be my only post for today, as I am going outside as much as possible, and getting off this stupid computer.   Summer is the best time to dance.

       Of your sweet insanity While I formulate denials  Of your affect on me     WOoOoOP SUMMER HOLS! I am finally done of grade 10 [even though this year went by super quick].. Super happy to be done of stupid ancient history, as amusing as it was, Im so glad to be done of his stupid tests that make no sense.  Although me and Kate did come up with some great pickup lines from the course.. my favourites were "Wanna see my gupta?" and "those are the biggest ma'muns I have ever seen!"  Unfortunetly nothing about our intelligent conversation-starters were on the exam.  Oh and Lauren, well you're the only one that reads this anyway, so of course Im going to talk about you. Like this:   astoria.  she crashed like an atom bomb says: IT;S MORGAN... SHE'S DONE OF SCHOOL... I HATE HER astoria.  she crashed like an atom bomb says: oh hey, how are you   Hahahha. You make me laugh... We are so witty. [Did I mention that modesty is over rated]   YES  Toga BBQ at Morgans for the first day of summer!   Listening To:  Bang Bang - Nancy Something.

       1 Day Until:  I [possibly] pass my ancient history exam. I pass my English exam. Summer. Freedom. Dreadlocks, or the beginnings of them.   Plus  on Friday I am now Kates special guest for the show! aka I get in free. Swicked. I love free stuff.. specially when its food :)  I hate doctors, and their crazy appointments..   ---------  8:42PM   I officially love Laozi and what he did for Daoism. And Im done studying!  "Damn you You and your activites"  Well Im off to do something productive.

      10:11PM TYLER, I have to talk to you. I am not impressed with your lack of communication :| Thank you Joey, for spilling the beans.  Exams: 2 days.  mmm, immunities.   ---------- I got off work early which is awesome and I've been studying on and off outside and its such a beautiful day.. Im still not sure if I know enough to pass ancient history but honestly as long as I get above 50% on the exam I will be happy.  I went running last night for the first time in a long time, and it felt great. I know I wont do it, but I really should start running more. Like every 2nd day would be good. I may just do that! [I lie.]  Im wearing arics shorts again, they have gotta be the best shorts in the world. Well almost.. so yes they are now mine. ...Man I have to pee.  Jess and Alyson visited me at work today which was wonderful, and I convinced them to buy me a iced cappuchino from Tims. And Byron gave me candy.. what a funny old man.  I have to restring my acoustic and play it would be good, since I havent picked up a guitar for about a week. Its killing me, not so softly.  Well Im going swinging with Lauren so I must study till then! Later dudes.  PS- Lydia on Wednesday you are  MINE .

      Im so tired. I dont understand why anyone would actually WANT a job. I dont need this money! I spend it on stupid things. And stuff thats fun for a while but then I wonder why I bought it. And its just because I have money. Sigh.  Although all the things that happen at work are pretty funny though.. plus Byron bought us a freaking icecream cake today [again] and I got some this time. Plus some candy. And cookie. Did I mention that I feel like throwing up?  On the bright side it is pretty good to have money and spend it on absolutely nothing. Or say, The Darkness CD or Laurens birthday present.  I cant wait for Hootie and APRIL WINE. I got a free ticket from working down there with Celebrate Canada, and its awesome. Apparently matt's working with us this year too. I wonder how thatll work out. I wonder if Ill get frustrated with him and freak out. After putting up with his crap for such a long time, I now have a very short fuse. But whatever, maybe it will be ok. And the concerts will be amazing.  OK So the dreads still arent in but MONDAY! Or Tuesday. I  will  have them in before next weekend.   Plus : I might be getting my nose pierced. Why? Because Ive wanted to for years and I have the money. And Im old enough now to go by myself. Screw my parents. They need to lighten up anyway. So thats a maybe.      ..so it looks like I was right when I said that this summer would be the best one yet. It has been so far at least.

      Im very,  very  happy to say that I am, so far, having the best summer yet.  June 21st. First day of summer = BBQ, listened to records, freak rainstorm, was attacked by at least 3 junebugs, played with puppies. Behn was also over, practically for the whole day, and I got to see Joe and Matt which is always a good thing. We watched SLC Punk. I love that movie. It actually makes anarchy sound like sense.  OH BABY, Dread kit came today too.. dreads are going in wednesday for sure. I wonder how long itll take? Maybe into Thursday too.  Well, dont count on me updating a lot from now on, Im doing pretty good with the whole not-going-on-the-computer-as-much. Its good.  Hope everyones summer is going as well as mine is :)   Listening To: 3 Libra's- A Perfect Circle  Cause I threw you the obvious To see if theres more behind the eyes of a fallen angel Eyes of a tragedy.

       Oh baby, Oh baby.   So we [me Jess and Ryan, but then only Jess] started dreading today. I have 13 [well 12.5] beautiful dreads and they keep getting better. And Tyler is a dreadlocking master. I wish I knew how to put pictures on this stupid thing. Id ask Lauren but she left me. Bah! Meh, Next time for sure.  And Kyles got a girlfriend!! And Im pretty sure [no, Im really sure] that me and Lauren are more excited than Kyle is. But whatever. Thats not important, and I think I see a double date coming up in the near future.. yup. I do.   Listening To:  well nothing, but I wish I was listening to Love On The Rocks With No Ice by The Darkness because it is my new favourite song.. oh how I love you, Justin Hawkins. What a rock star.   So many issues we should address 'Cause our lives dont correlate All the emotions that we suppress Bite our tongues until its too late  Love on the rocks, you'd do anything for a quiet life Love on the rocks, Love on the rocks with no ice

      Ok so we're still only halfway done of the dreading process, but whatever. My scalp is itchy because of the "locking accelerator" aka sea salt. But whatever, Im not gonna complain. Cause this is what I wanted.. right?   Right.   So Im going through another Ben Folds stage, and finding all this new [well new to me] and great stuff. Its more of my happy music, it makes me dance.  And my family is going to a cottage for the next week I think? So I wont be posting, not that Id be posting anyway, since its SUMMER and beautiful out. Well not for the past couple of days but whatever.  Speaking of crappy weather, oh baby, I didnt write about the concert. Well, APRIL WINE and HOOTIE was amazing. Bloody amazing. Behn made a sign for april wine and they talked to us and everything. And pointed! I want to find out who that guitar/keyboard/vocals/tamborine! guy is because he was like The most talented person ever and yet hes not on their website or in any of the band pictures. So Im a bit curious about that.   ..PS Tyler missed the concert sooo yes he sucks. Plus our new friend, aka random drunk-off-his-ass guy. He was a good singer [not really] but he was very.. uhhhhh.. friendly.  Anyway what else is new.. ok nothing, and Im tired. So go to bed.  Ok, sounds good.   He shouted out his last word And he stumbled through the yard And she shattered her last china plate And spun off in the car When he lunged onto the hood She stopped to tell him she'd been wrong He was thrown head over heels Into the traffic coming on But then All is fair in love

      This is the first time in a long time that I've actually done something with Lydia 2 days in a row. This is pathetic and I hate it. But anyway at least I got to see her, and we went shopping. And talked. And looked at old pictures and yearbooks and ate icecream, just like the good ol' days.  I was walking her home actually when we decided [well I convinced her] to walk down to the bonfire that Tyler was at down at co op. When we got there who was there but Bryce, who proceeded to run and jump on me repeatedly. I really should hang out with him more often, because I miss him. Hes like a puppy. All that energy... always with the energy.  " Wear the running shoes, morgan.. run home! "  My parents are insane.  Im so tired and I work on thursday from 6:30  AM  [crowpiss if youre Lydia] till 3. But Lauren we're still gonna do something because I miss you immensely and I still need to give you your letter.  And Matt Sheidow [aka Pretty] is going to Ontario soon.. I will miss him, actually I miss him already.  Thats the only thing about school.. theres always so much socializing that goes on with it. Even if youre as anti-social as I am sometimes.

      Well Im back from the cottage as of Friday and is anyone else noticing that time is going by crazy fast? I mean there was celebrate canada and the festival and concerts, and then all of a sudden Im at the cottage, having a blast doing absolutely nothing. Now Im here, after working 2 shifts at GCB again. And family reunion. Wait, what?  Its all giving me a headache.  Anyway, from what I can rememer, the cottage was awesome. Monday we had crap weather so me and Jess and Mom went to Dunes [crazy artistic gift shop type thing.] We spent 3 hours in there and I think it was the highlight of my week. Besides the cottage itself I mean.. it was better than my house.  But going back to Dunes.. amazing. It was amazing. Mom even bought us dessert, which was orgasmic. I got this chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce cake thing [drool] and raspberry tea.   So good. [drool again]. Anyway back to reality, Jess got a wooden mask thing for her room and we all got free rings, made of seashell. Pretty damn cool.  It makes me think about what I want to do when I grow up. No office job for me, thanks. I think Id kill myself if I ever had a cubicle. I wonder if I could open up a shop like that? It would be very very cool. And fun. Oh, the possibilites..  But knowing me I would go backrupt in weeks.   Rejection.   Lauren I miss you so much. And Kyle. And Lydia! And Bryce and everyone that I havent seen so far this summer. What am I doing?  I need some Tylonel.

And I hate to be whiny but these dreads are definetly NOT summer hair. Anyway.    &nbsp;  So Lauren is gone and I will miss her terribly.. Its gonna be tough to keep up the hotness without you but Ill do my best.    &nbsp;  I was actually thinking about staying off the computer for a week or so last night, then I realised that I am way too weak.

       Todays Rant: Why I Hate&nbsp;Fake People.   I do not and never will understand why some people think that they cannot be themselves. Or when people think they have to be skanks/"cool"/the same as everyone else to fit in. The world would be such a happier and more interesting place if everyone started acting like themselves, dressing like themselves and not trying to be exactly like the model in that random magazine.  Why is it that people have that strange urge&nbsp;to be like everyone else? Well, people want to be accepted, they want to have friends.. no matter what they try to tell people. In an attempt to do this, some people go too far and give up even their own personalities in order to be "happy".  Ive been there. Its not a fun place to be. You hate yourself for not being who you are, and its like you live in constant fear of being found out. Its draining, frustrating and annoying, and I gave up, thanks to my laziness.. its been the best thing that could ever happen to me.  So the moral of this story? Well its just easier to be yourself in the long run. And its better too. So wipe the cum off your face, get off your knees, and wear something respectable. Thank you.  &nbsp;  Today I restrung my electric guitar. And played it.. its been a while. I havent used it since&nbsp;the band broke up.. I miss it. Not just the guitar but the band. Especially the band. I think we were supposed to jam sometime this week.. thatd be really nice. The biggest problem was that we started things too seriously. We didnt play for the music anymore.. we just played because.. why did we play? for gigs? just to say we were in a band?&nbsp;I dont know. Whatever the case was, it wasnt fun anymore. Maybe we've all grown up a little and can make it work this time.    &nbsp;  Somehow I doubt that.    &nbsp;  Can't wait until tomarrow morning..    &nbsp;   If you want to destroy my sweater,     I don't want to destroy your tank-top.     Hold this thread as I walk away.      Let's be friends and just walk away.     Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked.      Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies     Lying on the floor, lying on the floor     I've come undone

        WELCOME BACK LAUREN    Im so excited you get your very own post. Its great to have you back. Our walk was fun and I got a chocolate bar, which is always good. I ate so much crap today though, I need to run.. I walked home is that good enough? My mom yelled at me. She is "disappointed" again.    &nbsp;  No work until Friday, when I work -what? A 4 hour shift? Swickedness. My feet hurt though.     &nbsp;  No one is on so Im trying to convince myself to go to bed... Go to bed. Hopefully it will be sunny tomarrow so that I can sit outside and do nothing and tan  all  day. I love summer.    &nbsp;  I wrote Kate a&nbsp;letter today. I was talking to her mom at work and she said it isnt too late to send one, and it reminded me that I should write one. So I did. Its pretty long too, and its basically me reminising [ach! I will never be able to spell that..] about our countless good times in ancient history. When both of us showed up that is.    &nbsp;   Listening To : Nirvana Unplugged in NY , the newest cd to my ever-growing collection.
