          For starters, I'm not so narcissistic nor self important to believe that anyone gives a shit about my day-to-day operations. Nor do I intend to utilize this space to track my daily menial tasks.       Boss?      Boss.       Sometimes, however, my rather unstable life produces an interesting and equally unstable day. Today was just such a day.      My exact employment isn't of importance, but be it known that on occasion I am required to travel for one reason or another. Today I had to "pick up" a Mac computer and a huge HP printer from a former employee of ours. Coincidently, "pick up" is cordial for repossess. And this task required an eight and one half hour kamikaze run to South Texas. More specifically, to Brenham, Texas. Home of Blue Bell Ice Cream and Blinn Junior College.      The drive really wasn't that bad, considering that I was traveling in a comfortable company car. A Chrysler 300, as a matter of fact. Quite a pleasure to navigate compared to the busted up piece of shit that I normally get to pilot on such treks.      The lengthy journey required a much earlier start to my day than I would normally undertake. You see, I have suffered from insomnia since my early teens. Attempting to achieve a sleep-like state before 2 AM is as ridiculous a concept as teleportation. Someone may eventually solve the puzzle, but long after I am gone from this Earth. I have given up in my search for quality sleep, and resign myself to the like of Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin and Vincent Van Gogh - all insomniacs. So was Hitler, but we choose not to associate our malady with him.      My intense insomnia translates into low-grade narcolepsy when I am required to rise at any time close to the sun doing as well. As such, I'm pretty sure I nodded off somewhere around Hillsboro. I missed Waco altogether.      The real fun started about 50 miles outside of Brenham, my destination. Apparently the Blue Bell Creamery was prepping the front lines for an attack. 18-wheeled tractor and trailer rigs bearing the company's name and logo lined the rest stops and picnic areas along the small two-lane highway leading into the home of the self-proclaimed "Best Ice Cream in the Country." Obviously, the good people at Blue Bell were fearful of an all-out assault from Ben & Jerry. That or they were preparing for sortie runs from Breyers. Either way, the little creamery had them headed off at the pass.      Scared as I might be that I was to be caught in the crossfire during the fracas, I was running on fumes. I picked out a Shell station that, unlike the other choices, wasn't a converted trailer and pulled in. As I filled the fine machine with the most affordable gas I'd seen in a year, I noticed a small blue pickup truck wedged between two of the Blue Bell battalions next to the station. I required nicotine, and decided that it was best if I step away from the pump of combustible gasoline before indulging in my filthy vice. I made my way toward the truck, thinking that I may need to point out the impending melee that this good person was sure to find himself in if not careful.      Upon reaching the truck, I realized that the man was there on his on behest. He was selling watermelons from the back of his S-10. I hadn't noticed the enormous wooden sign propped against the tailgate. Probably because it was almost entirely unreadable. This was the New World Order of chicken scratch. It quickly became apparent that this man and I were  en communicado . He spoke no English, I no dialect of whatever country he hailed. It wasn't Spanish, nor was he any derivation of. I am still baffled.       My sense of sight and smell had to guide me through the experience. My sight told me that he had been in a scuffle with a female. The scratches from long fingernails down his face and the purple-red swells on his entire cheek that were proof positive of two or three hard open-palmed slaps gave up their story instantly. Whoever she was, she'd beaten this poor man like a rented mule.      My sense of smell told me that had I uttered it, he would have easily understood the word "Mota." Or any derivation of.  I suspect also that he would also have produced any measurement that I desired, if only asked.      "He don't speak no English over thare." I turned to see one of the Blue Bell minute-men walking towards me.      "Been tryin' to find out what he'd take for one o' them melons, but I can't understand him."       The sign clearly said that "them melons" were $4 apiece. Or it may have said $7. Or $9.      Taking advantage of the opportunity to interview this dairy soldier before he picked up arms against whatever bastard son of ice cream evil that was making its way down Route 39 towards us, I quickly changed the subject. I asked him why the trucks were all up and down the road, 50 miles outside of base camp.      "I dunno." The man I affectionately dubbed Cookie Puss muttered. "Guess we all just decided to up n' pull in at the same time."      Ahhh. A master strategist I could see. Not one to divulge the game plan.      I pointed out that there were hundreds (an over estimation) of Blue Bell trucks along the pass, as far as the eye can see.      "Well, we all like to stop an' get us a Coke and a samich' before we hit the long haulin' I guess. And here's where we usually do it."      He then informed me that some of the "drivers" also liked to defecate in friendly territory before venturing too far into the world. Apparently this little fold of Earth was aligned with the time it took the drivers to "shake up a good shit" after leaving the creamery early in the morning. I put 2 and 2 together and decided that Cookie Puss was pissing me off. I bid him adieu, which confused him greatly, and wandered off to repossess my computer and clear the area before the Good Humor Man suicide bombed Mama's Homemade Infantry.  ....to be continued....

      A happy 4th to everyone. Today we mark the 228th birthday of our great nation. From the Pacific Northwest to the Florida Keys men, women, and children alike are celebrating our independence and freedom in the same manner: getting shit-faced and using centuries-old Chinese pyrotechnic technology in willy-nilly fashion. I haven't touched a firework in years, owing to three separate instances during my youth, any one of which could/should have maimed me for life.   First, there was the time I twist-tied four or five Black-Cats together and lit them, only to have them all go off in my hand. I couldn't have been more than 7 years old at the time, and thankfully I didn't have them in closed fist. Otherwise the grand explosion would have surely blown my hand off, spreading my tiny fingers to the winds. Second came the ever-unpredictable Saturn Rocket 'Mishap of '87'. Involved were a wood-sided cabin, approximately 50 fluid-ounces of Weber starter fluid, misconfiguration of the highest order, and the singeing loss of both eyebrows. Lastly there was an unfortunate roman candle war incident. Listen kids. Never try to stomp an ablaze roman candle ball out on the concrete when it hits you and bounces off. Rubber soles melt through quickly, and a roman candle ball embedded in the bottom of your foot smarts. For weeks. And charcoals the skin nicely.  Since I've sworn off fireworks, this year I skipped the traditional family get-togehter that was host to the aforementioned episodes. Truthfully, I skipped the gathering because I don't like my extended family. At all. It would have required a trip to East Texas to see cousins that would probably beat me senseless if I weren't related to them. I don't hunt (ever), much less on a daily basis. This fact alone makes me suspect in their world. I also prefer circulation in my legs, and therefore opt against the painted on blue-jean. This clothing choice and the conspicuous absence of a foot-long wallet in my back pocket are reason enough to earn me the moniker "city boy."  Instead of spending the day avoiding a lynching, I chose to gamble in another way. Every friend of mine from college is obsessed with the World Series of Poker and Texas Hold 'Em. I don't get the infatuation. I've played in a few tournaments with them, but today I got suckered into my first online tournament. See, I do well playing with these guys in person. I know that one of them will play with his bottom lip when he's got a monster. I know another will talk massive trash when he's got nothing. They all have their quirks. Online, however, I got nothing. And that's exactly what I have to show for the $50 that I had eight hours ago. Never again will I gamble online. What a snake oil medicine show.  I might as well had spent that $50 on firecrackers and at least had fun burning it. I'd honestly feel better if I'd just given someone $50 to kick me in the nuts. All my buddies sucked it up, too. Great idea guys. Thanks. We all could have gotten together, drank beer and played until 3:00 a.m. tonight and had fun with it. But noooooooo....we had to play in this tournament because the top three got free $10,000 buy-ins to the next World Series of Poker. As if we were going to win. And as if we have any business even attempting to qualify for the damn World Series of Poker.  As things turned out, some douche bag calling himself DMan69 now has $50 of my money. Is there anything in the world worse than losing something to a "69" guy?
