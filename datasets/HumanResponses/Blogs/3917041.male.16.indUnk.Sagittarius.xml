						   Yeah so I got back from Bible Memory Camp today. It was AWESOME. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it when I left. Even after the first day I still wasn't sure. It was a lot of fun. There were games and tournaments. Friendly competitions. However the thing that did it for me was the worship. I have never felt God's presence as strong as I have this last week. Never have I heard more powerful words spoken. never have I seen so much love and belief in God from any group (That large) of people that I have ever known. I must say that it has changed my life. So to everyone who told me that I should go and who made it possible for me to go. Thank You!!!!!

						   Well today I went shopping.&nbsp; I got some new clothes to wear to camp.&nbsp; I'm not sure how stylich they are but I tried my best.&nbsp; I can only hope that they match well enough for BethAnne to approve.&nbsp; I also got some dress clothes for when I start bowling this year, but I won't get into that today.&nbsp; I also went to Mediaplay today.&nbsp; I was going to get a movie, but they are ripping people off.&nbsp; I saw a movie there that was two years old, and they still wanted $19.95 for it.&nbsp; Can you believe that.&nbsp; Instead I ended up getting a big band collection of cd's.&nbsp; Duke Ellington, Glen Miller, and Count Basie were all in the set.&nbsp; I listened to all three on the way home, and yeah it was really good.  Something that kinda ruined my day today was the fact that all the bowling allies were closed.&nbsp; The ones in Bay City didn't open till 5 and we left at four.&nbsp; Then the one in Pinconning wasn't open because the lanes were getting resufaced.&nbsp; Then the bowling alley in Standish wasn't open.&nbsp; How am I supposed to live like this.&nbsp; I need to get my weekly amount of bowling in.&nbsp; If I don't I can get very cranky and a bad side of myself may come out.&nbsp; I hope that I go bowling soon, for everyone's sake.  Well I guess that will be all for today.&nbsp;

						   The answer is not much.&nbsp; Yesterday we had bible study which was fun.&nbsp; We went to Hubie's in Tawas to play putt-putt.&nbsp; Yeah it's true my team lost.&nbsp; Then we went to Pizza Hut.&nbsp; All in all I finished the night with -$5.&nbsp; Then the ride home was interesting, but i won't go into details since it could confuse people not accustomed to rides with me involved.&nbsp; There was some licking and some weird conversation.&nbsp; I just don't want to relive it all.  Well today wasn't anything special.&nbsp; I went to work.&nbsp; It was really hot.&nbsp; Then I came home and did a whole lot of nothing.&nbsp; until now.&nbsp; I'm typing this and talking to BethAnne and Alecia.&nbsp; Somehow I got Alecia mad, but I don't know how.&nbsp; I appologized anyway though.&nbsp;   I'm leaving for Bible Memory Camp on Sunday.&nbsp; I guess that it is supposed to be a lot of fun, but I've never gone to it before.&nbsp; The girls are like flipping out over it though.&nbsp; It's like all that I've been hearing about this month.&nbsp; To tell the truth I'm not entirely sure that I will like it.&nbsp; I'm not exactly one of the world's greatest people persons.&nbsp; I guess that I will just have to wait and see&nbsp; how it turns out.&nbsp; Well that is all for today.

						   Well lets see.&nbsp; Today I went to a Detroit Tiger's game.&nbsp; That happens to be where I had two women in front of me dancing in their seats holding beers.&nbsp; I happened to find that to be quite comical.&nbsp; Well it was a good game to watch.&nbsp; The Tigers beat the Yankees 4 to 2.&nbsp; There were two home runs that were hit.&nbsp; Both of them landed about 20 rows in front of our seats.&nbsp; We were sitting right down the left field line.&nbsp; They were good seats, but the drawback was that we couldn't see the big score board because it was right behind us.&nbsp; I got a hat as a souveneir, which I am currently wearing.&nbsp; It feels weird to wear a hat though, because I don't usually wear them.&nbsp; That would be the majority of today.&nbsp;   Right now I don't have anything that i need to get off my mind, or at least not anything that I need to get off my mind by posting it on the internet.&nbsp; That's all for now.&nbsp; So to all my loyal fans, keep reading.

						   well I guess yesterday is as good a place to start as any.&nbsp; Well I had work which was oh so joyous.&nbsp; Then BethAnne stopped in, and I was in the candy shop.&nbsp; BethAnne bought 10 chocolate covered strawberries, and we ended up deciding that we should do something that night.&nbsp; Well BethAnne, Ross, and myself decided to watch Dodgeball in Tawas.&nbsp; Which as it turnes out was funny.&nbsp; I wasn't sure.&nbsp; I thouhgt that the preveiws made it look kinda stupid, but it was the right amount of stupid and funny mixed.&nbsp; After that we came back to BethAnne's house.&nbsp; Then I was invited into her house where I got to see the menu for American Pie.&nbsp; It was interesting.&nbsp; Then I came home, read, and went to bed. &nbsp; What should I talk about today.&nbsp; Why is it that we have such trouble believing.&nbsp; As children we are able to believe almost anything.&nbsp; We actually love to believe the unbelievable.&nbsp; What could be more unbelievable than magic.&nbsp; I don't know about you, but I believed in magic as a child.&nbsp; I had no doubt in my mind that the person was actually cut in half, and still alive.&nbsp; I believed that the guy actually made the girl disappear.&nbsp; Now as adults, or almost adults, it seems like everyone wants to understand evertything rather than believe.&nbsp; Expressions like "I'll believe it when I see it." only go to prove my point.&nbsp; I think that if we could keep that innocence this world would be a better place.&nbsp; Sometimes more questions only complicate things.&nbsp; Today I think that I will end with that thought.

						   Well&nbsp;I wrote the other day, and I foolishly forgot to write about something.&nbsp; I played DDR while I was at the bowling alley.&nbsp; For those of you not in the DDR world it is the dancing game with the arrows that you&nbsp;have to step on in order to dance.&nbsp; Yeah thats right I played it, and in public.&nbsp; And just to make sure that Alecia and BehtAnne don't get any crazy ideas, no I didn't pull out any of the dance moves from Saturday Night Fever.&nbsp; I thouhgt about it but decided that it would be for the best if I didn't.&nbsp; Anyway, it was fun and I beleive that eveybody should play that game at least once in their life.&nbsp; I thouhgt I would share that so if you don't intend to play at least you can have an entertaining image of me playing that game.&nbsp; Especially Ross, Sarah, and Alecia who have actually seen me play this game.&nbsp;   I have decided that from time to time I will use part of this to discuss issues that keep coming into my mind.&nbsp; This week it is why do people have to do things that confuse other people.&nbsp; Specifically why do girls manage to say something to confuse me.&nbsp; I won't name any names, but in the past few weeks i have been totally suprised by a few.&nbsp; One in particular.&nbsp; Why don't you just say what you mean.&nbsp; Sometimes it seems like you think of what to say to confuse me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm sorry to generalize like that.&nbsp; If I offended any of you girls out there I'm sorry, but I had to write that.&nbsp; I think I just needed to get it out of my mind.&nbsp; Also if any of you think that you can provide me help, please help me.

						   Bowling is great.  It is definitely my favorite sport.  Today I went bowling.  Now I had a 696 series (for those of you not in the bowling world that is a total of three games, a 232 average).  Well it feels great to do that, but I wanted to get a 700 series.  That is what is frustrating, because now I can look back and say one less mistake, or one more spare and I could have done it.  But oh well I guess that you can always do better, and that is what keeps me coming back to the game.  Well that's all for now, I just had to get that out.  I was a little excited since it is my highest series to date. Until Next time.

						   Ah where to begin.  I don't find my life all that intersting and don't expect other people to find it interesting either.  My friends are the most intersting and one of two reasons that my life is interesting.  The other is bowling, which I won't get into right now.  Well my friends are Alecia, BethAnne, Sarah, Leslie, Hannah, Ross, Ronnie, Ben, and a few others. (i'm sorry if i neglected to mention you).  Anyway these are the friends that gave me three personalities.  Scottie, the ladies man who is married to Sarah.  (There are also a few other women in his life, but lets not go there).  Then there is Tyrell who is married to Alecia.  He is also 9/8 of a man. Black, Asian, and White.  With three arms.  Then there is myself.  Just plain old Ryan.  Together with my other personalities I guess I can be interesting.  Well I guess that's all for now.  Feel free to comment on how weird I am.  Peace.

						   So we had a church campout.  It was fun.  It started Friday and ended this morning.  I went out friday after work.  We (Sarah, Ross, Alecia, and Myself) played Dutch Blitz.  It was fun, but it got kinda hard to see the cards when it got dark.  We had a lantern and some flashlights, but it was still hard to see.  Kevin came in after a while and we got him to start playing.  He was confused at first, but he got used to it.  Then I went home around midnight because it was cold and rainy and I didn't want to stay in a tent.   So after I slept in until 11:00 on saturday I went back out to the camp.  I ended up playing horse shoes with Sarah for a while.  Then we sat down around the fire and Alecia came back from her nap that she went home to take.  Then we ate, and I got made fun of for bringing food.  Oh well, i guess sometimes you need to be ridiculed by your friends.  At least I was able to laugh with them.  Then we ended up playing cards again.  This time we went to Sarah's house because we had more people (Monica and Beth Anne) and we also wanted to be able to see.  So we played Dutch Blitz and Pit.  Then Monica and Beth Anne left at like 11 so Alecia, Ross, Sarah, and I watched the Parent Trap.  I'm not really sure why, but it didn't seem like a bad idea at the time.  Then we all went to bed.   I got woke up at 10 by Sarah plopping down into a chair in the living room.  It was okay though because it woke me up from a nightmare.  I missed my bowling tournament because I couldn't leave work.  Well anyway we all got up and changed, and then went into the woods for church.  Then after that I went to work where I found out that I was missing a family reunion.  Not that I really wanted to go that badly, but it is kinda nice to see the family every once in a while.  Then now I am here typing this for a lack of something better to do.  So I will conclude with that.

						   I went to my first MJMA bowling tournament today.  It's the Michigan Junior Masters Association (MJMA), so I expected it to be all people from Michigan.  Also that it would be harder than the High School state tournament because there is no class distinction.  Well all of the top bowlers from Michigan were there, but also bowlers from New york, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Ontario (yes that would be in Canada).  Also they put out a PBA shot.  That means that it was the hardest possible oil pattern that they could have used.  So long story short, I didn't make it to the matchplay (I didn't do very well).  I had a 119 in there somewhere, I just am not sure how that happened, but it did.  I finished well though, I averaged like 195 for my last four games.  But it was too little too late.  A lady told me that she expects me to do good things this year, and she has been around it for like four years, and her husband helpd run it.  So that was vey good to hear.  Well I guess I will stop here because a lot of peaple don't want to read that much about bowling.  So it was a good day.  Bye.

						   So yeah, I'm going to my first bowling tournament Tuesday. Well my first bowling tournament outside of our school league anyway. I'm a little nervous. The tournament is limited to 108 entries. Like 25 spots are reserved for girls, so I only have to beat like 80 guys to win the tournament. Some of which have been bowling since they could walk. They just might have an advantage over me with my 3 years of bowling knowledge. This could be my talent from god, so I'm going to pursue it. I want to make the top 16 so that I will go to match play, but I don't know if that will happen. I will be tired too. The tournament is at ten in the morning, and it is a half hour north of Detroit. All I can do is try, and God will allow me to do what he wants me to do.  So I've also been thinking about the bible study that we talked about starting at school. Who is going to lead it? Who is going to decide what we talk about in it? Are we going to do that ourselves, or will there be someone else involved? I hope that we can do it, but when are we going to discus the details? I guess that will be all for now.

						   To tell you the truth I relly don't know what to put in this now.  BMC was like a life changing thing for me, but I do not yet know what specifically needs to be changed.  I feel like I should do something with my life now.  Something important.  But I don't know what.  God has a plan for me, but I don't know what that is.  That is the reoccuring thought that I have had for these past few days.  So I thought what are my talents.  Bowling and Band are the only two things that come to mind.  Could either of those be God's calling for me.  The only thing that I can think of is that I would travel a lot for bowling.  Maybe I am ment to talk to people about God in my travels.  I don't know.  It's questions like these though that are the reasons I haven't written much lately.  I feel like this should contain something more meaningful than what was previously in them.  I guess that I will leave with that today.
