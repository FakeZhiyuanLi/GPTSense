      Hmmm, yeah, I thought about a simple way of changing your IP... :D Ah well, let's just hope one vote  will  make a difference!  Hmmm, I don't really know 'bout the cause of the sleep disorder, could be a number of things. See, I've been and still am deprived of  normal  sleeping habit, maybe because I always want to do something ELSE instead of just sleep and let time pass by, maybe there's too much thought passing through my mind, or maybe I'm just still young and don't want to 'waste' my time on sleep... But when I do get into the state of sleep, I can stay in it for a fuckin' long time! :/ I guess it all depends on how you've accustomed you mind and body, changing that is a long process... and no, pills are never an answer, just try relaxing and feelin' good!

      I think I can reset my IP... it requires changing router configs.. I'd rather not fuck with that.. :)   On the note of sleep.. I'm very sleep deprived the past 2-3 weeks.. It's wierd I'm really tired and I goto lay down and I'm suddenly not tired.. Anyone know what's up?  Just OD on sleeping pills? Sounds like a winner!

      3am... Damn, I still can't get my sorry ass to sleep...  Well guys, I've been to the Casino today (again); made some money, just 'bout enough to spend it on a few drinks with my best friend. We had one of those "love hurts and life's a bitch" conversations, but I'm guessin' everything turned out oK in the end. :) He's having some "problems" with his (ex?)g/f, and he knows I'm always the one person he can turn to... and so he did... and so we talked for a couple of hours... and we are now so tired... :( Well anyway, I just hope everything turns out oK for them; it would be a shame to let all hope wander off in such an early relationship development.  You must be wondering why I brought all this up... "is he frustrated, having problems with his own love-life...?". I'll give you a straight answer -  NO ... ;) I'm happily in-love and intend to keep it that way! With this said, I'm sending a whole bunch of kisses to my sweety :***...  oH, and btw., don't blame me for typing all of this, I tend to get lonely in the mornin'... ;)  Have fun now!

      Sadly, I have to inform people that I'm still a bit ill (or sick if you wish)... My left cheek is still swollen, but I feel oK. This weekend should give me enough time to recover myself. :D Not being at your job can really make you feel pathetic in a way, but then again you can enjoy things you couldn't if you were working. Things like saying all sorts of bullshit in a virtual place. LOL!  Well anyway, I'm still on my first coffee today, so don't  try  to understand me, cuz that would really be impossible.

      Yeah, I know what you mean. But circumstances change by the minute and I'm (by chance) stuck with it and in it. Let me tell you, it's not a nice place to be, not a nice time to be in something like that. I'm very serious at the moment, regarding just about everything I come into contact with. Frankly, it scares me and I hope to snap out of it soon. I'm serious about my relationship (which I hope it booms over'n'over again), 'bout my work, my life in general. I know all this sounds strange coming from me, but there's nothing I can do about it, I just feel that way, it's a flow that cannot be stopped that easily.  Then again, it's very hard to exactly define what's going through my mind, I just want to be taken seriously, maybe that's why I'm being serious... ...and I think that's a wrong approach, but I've tried everything possible to let people see what I'm all about. Those people are now gone from my life, just because I wanted it that way, 'cause I got tired of listening to all sorts of bullshit. I kept reminding myself that I should stop, and so I did.  It doesn't matter, I got used to starting from scratch everytime something happened. I hope this is the last time I have to do something from the beginning.  Take care now...

      Monday, feels like Sunday. There was something 'bout this day that gave me the creeps, and now I'm all messed up trying to find a reason to all of that. Ah well, maybe I'll just turn off my brain this week for a while and let everything come to me, gently. :)  Monday... I have to get back to work on Tuesday. Damn, and to think I was so relaxed whole this time. Seems like everything must have an end. And so it does.  Tuesday, over Wednesday, Thursday and Friday... Just a lot of stress and fucked up situations, waste of time and energy reserved for happiness... When will people realize what life's all about, when will someone finally understand what it is I'm constantly all about?  Saturday... I'm in bed, maybe with someone I love, maybe I'm happy, maybe I'm not thinking about anything, maybe I just know what it's all about!  Sunday... Can you see me, feel me? Do you know me anymore, did you take the time needed to get to know me? No? ...I thought so...  C'ya!

      What the fuck did I do to deserve that?! :p If you pay close attention to my last words (my cousin's to be precise), you'll see that you're the one who should pay a visit to Hell, being so ignorant and not knowing me! :D ^... so much for the love between Stephen and me... LOL!  Well anyway, I hope everyone spent Easter relaxed and in company of their loved ones, eventhough I didn't have the chance to spend it with my loved  one ... Nope, I'm definitely not counting my family as they tend to get on my nerves asking all sorts of retarded and boring questions... Now all of a sudden they give a damn 'bout how I'm doing in life... riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...  Honey, nei, I can't tell you how much I miss you! ...can't wait to see you soon! :*  ...oh, 2all, remind me to get a bumper-sticker, saying: "It wasn't me!" ;)

      Some of you still think of me as a bad person 'bout what I've said here earlier 'bout the cat... You know what, I don't care, and you know why? - I think I won't waste any of my words, I'll just quote my cousin, dated back in 1993:   I was here, but now I'm gone... I left this note to turn you on... Those who know me, know me well... Those who don't, can go to Hell!

       Sunday, Easter, 0100h...   There I am, bored to death and stuffed with Easter ham, looking for some shit to do, things to demolish, stuff like that... :D Since I managed to suck out some money from my "dad", I decided to tank some fresh unleaded into my Trinity and make a cruise in a virtually deserted city of Zagreb. Puttin' some clothes on (being just in my underwear) I manage to drop my cigarette almost igniting my damn carpet... It now strikes me that I should've looked at the signs before undertaking the adventure of cruising. ;) Well anyway, I got into Trin, pushed a freshly burned AudioCD into my player, opened the sunroof and pressed the damn pedal with just three simple letters on it:  G .. A .. S . Gettin' to the gas station took 'round 10 minutes at an average speed of 55mph, which isn't that bad considering there were still some idiots on the road. I got my petrol and headed out to annoy some people, as well as to look for cops to pull me over and ask me if I was drinking anything. :D Now why does this sound so weird to you? :p ...well, I don't recall the last time I was pulled over for ANY reason; since I got Trinity cops seem to ignore me, no matter how fast I drive. o_O oK, so I head out to Spansko (part of Zagreb) 'cause I know they're out there somewhere... *BINGO* - I spotted them, but they were stationed opposite of my direction. DAMN! ... Ah well, I decided to make a U turn after a couple of miles and scratch their balls a bit later. I got lost in time, didn't realize half an hour passed... "time to get those cops...", or so I thought... The blue fucks left by the time I got back! *grrr*  I've listened the whole damn CD through and got bored, so I decided to go home to get some old coffee and prepare myself for nightmares I'm going to dream... So there I am, completely relaxed, both front windows down, smoking a cigarette, lookin' at some drunk women passing by lookin' completely stupid, when all of a sudden a FUCKIN' CAT comes running out of nowhere! oK, so she's after my Trinity's pussy or something, or she just wanted to check the tire's pressure. *boom, bang, miyauuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...* - the cat got busted! :D Now let me tell you, it was  LOUD ! "poor Trinity", I screamed; I had to pull over and take a look at potential damage done to her... I don't want to sound insensitive, but the cat asked for it; why the fuck did she have to run under a speeding car, with absolutely no damn chance of stopping and letting her highness cross the road?! ...and since there was a moron in a car behind me licking my car's ass, there was no fucking way I was to brake!  I pulled over and took a look... oK, no major damage done, just some torn plastic and shit. *phew*. I strolled back to the "crime scene" to check everything out and found her dead, without any blood around, took a bag and pulled her off the road. I also took some pictures with my cell phone, but I'm not going to publish them.  I think all of this proves how much I love cats! LMAO! ...but still, there's a philosophical approach to all of this, being Easter and all... I'll post those thoughts in  urlLink voice from within  once I get my thoughts organized.  ...and that, my dears, concludes the story of my short cruise...  Be good now, and stroke your kittens if you have any! ;)
