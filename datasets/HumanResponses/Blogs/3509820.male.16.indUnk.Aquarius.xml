LETTERS FROM HOME :  BY JOHN MICHAEL MONTGOMERY   My Dear Son, it is almost June, I hope this letter catches up to you, and finds you well Its been dry but they’re calling for rain, And everything's the same ol’ same in Johnsonville Your stubborn 'ol Daddy ain’t said too much, But I’m sure you know he sends his love, And she goes on, In a letter from home  I hold it up and show my buddies, Like we ain’t scared and our boots ain’t muddy, and they all laugh, Like there’s something funny bout’ the way I talk, When I say: "Mama sends her best y’all" I fold it up an' put it in my shirt, Pick up my gun an' get back to work An' it keeps me driving me on, Waiting on letters from home  My Dearest Love, its almost dawn I’ve been lying here all night long wondering where you might be I saw your Mama and I showed her the ring Man on the television said something so I couldn’t sleep But I’ll be all right, I’m just missing you An' this is me kissing you XX’s and OO’s, In a letter from home  I hold it up and show my buddies, Like we ain’t scared and our boots ain’t muddy, and they all laugh, 'Cause she calls me "Honey", but they take it hard, 'Cause I don’t read the good parts I fold it up an' put it in my shirt, Pick up my gun an' get back to work An' it keeps me driving me on, Waiting on letters from home  Dear Son, I know I ain’t written, But sittin' here tonight, alone in the kitchen, it occurs to me, I might not have said, so I’ll say it now Son, you make me proud  I hold it up and show my buddies, Like we ain’t scared and our boots ain’t muddy, but no one laughs, 'Cause there ain’t nothing funny when a soldier cries An' I just wipe me eyes I fold it up an' put it in my shirt, Pick up my gun an' get back to work An' it keeps me driving me on, Waiting on letters from home

WELL i guess i did go to some old ppls house on the lake and watched fireworks on the 3rd, that was kinda fun.i guess.The next day was independence day i saw know fireworks that day but i did go to church,and learned about god, obviously.there was no one there,exceptg for kendra but she was T.I.R.E.D so she didnt talk much AMAZINGLY,LOL. then i went to my grandparents house right after church and didnt leave until like 11:30 pm.it was so boring over there,i was there for like ten hours helpin them clean there garage,but on monday my grand parents took us to eat at  golden carroul,it was good.then we went to home depot ,but i dont rember what we got.owell.  ANY WHO last night at like 12 or 12 30  i was flippin channels tryin to find somthin to watch o tv,i have like 99 channels and the only show i found was WILL AND GRACE, ive never really watched that show pretty much cause i think gay ppl should burn in hell,but thats just my opinion.(j/k)i really dont think that, i just dont like them.but anyways i watched it and it was acctually pretty funny i have to admit.  well thats just bout all i got to say ,and my favorite song of the day is,  "THESE DAYS" BY RASCAL FLATTS   HEYPHIL HIPHIL SIGNING OUT
