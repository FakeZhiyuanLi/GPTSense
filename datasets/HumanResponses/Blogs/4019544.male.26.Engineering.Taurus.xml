      Today will be the day in history of my life- i'm gonna published the story of Sir Gideon. It's something that i should do a long long time ago. I should thank Dorothy a dear friend of mine for introducing me this site. I find it interesting suddenly to have all your 'life' published online. Great stuff Dot, thanks a million.   Ok, let's start..............   Today, July 24, 2004.....after an unventful Saturday, i suddenly had the urge to write some stuf about myself. I am a very bad publisher as you know..bad with words, bad with ideas and bad with most of the shit around me. But for a forgetful dude like me...at least there's something that will helps me to remember stuff in a day ..hahahaha   Woke up this morning around 0700hrs. Yeah pretty early for a dude, guess the rain and the cold temp sent shiver and goose bumps all over me. As like most of my Sats, i got out of the bed and grab the pole of the broom, and started sweeping the whole house. Josh has long gone off to work.&nbsp;He and his crew will do few commercial shooting in Hard Rock Cafe today..Poor dude, he&nbsp;hasn't has a good full weekend to spend and rest.&nbsp;Rick and Chris, hhmm....still in their candy bar dreams. Still blurry from the event of 'just woke up',&nbsp;I flicked Rick's system switch and the swrilling sound of the motor begins to break the morning silence..."wow!! what a noise".. i thought. Moving the mouse to the url box, i then started to type few of the most important sites in my life...cnn.com, the star.com.my, jpl.gov and who can forget hotmail and yahoo...   I am just interested in the current update of Dr. Judson's chopper crash...Poor doc. I dunno when will the rescue ends. It has been two full weeks now and there's no seems to be any sign of the missing chopper or its passengers to be found. Only God knows where they are now. Pity their family..just imagine, how hellish it could be for them to go through life every day and night without knowing the true fate of their love ones.   Yesterday, the guys and I were whacking pizza at KJ Giants Pizza Hut. It's not a special dinner thingy, just one of those days when we suddenly wanna spent money on good food. The menu of that night, Hawaiian Supreme and Chix Deluxe....two of our all time fav.  Reaching home around 2200hrs, i went online..that was the time when I 'ping' Dot....a nice warm chat&nbsp;we had..  Then she told me that she went through a painful break up. I was&nbsp;shock when she told me this. What kind a dude that silly enough to leave a nice warm lady such as&nbsp;her? This is something that my over stuffed brain can't compute!!!!   She told me most of the story line..then I knew that very instant, this dude called Marcus- he aint ready for commitment...no self confidence. He's the type of dude that "...I am not good for you", "...I need to chase my dreams first and it will hurt you when I can's spend most of my time with you..." blah blah blah.....  Hey!!! wake up chump!!  she's there man!!! all the time for you..   If you know from the begining that you are in love with this nice lady and know that she will be there for you no matter what, what are you&nbsp;'chickened' off!! For me, you can go and chase all your dreams even till Kingdom comes, if you know that she will be there always for you......there's nothing to be afraid of. Dude, this is totally not fair for the lady, man. You are making her feel useless, incapable and crippled. You took half of her life out man!!!  There's nothing else worst than making someone feel this way!!!   Then, I told Dot just to  "forget bout it"... yeah yeah..i know it easy to say than done. But it's the best thing to do. While chatting with her, suddenly my darkest history creeps into my head. The day when Joanne left. It was so so hurting that&nbsp;I didn't even wanna eat for the whole week.I was so so angry, that when the anger struck, i smashed our kitchen door, broke Joel's wooden hanger (sorry dude) and smashed my bed!! - too emotional? wacko? childish? you decide..&nbsp;Anger!! feeling of crushing defeat!!! feeling useless!!! feeling back stabbed!!! all shits were there at that time. It was one HELL of a history.   I told Dot bout this. I know how bad and down she must has felf. I feel sorry for her. It's just not fair. But who are we to say what's fair and not? We learn from this kinda crap. It made me strong, made me immune to all break ups and self pity. So that was yesterday. Hope she can pick herself up slowly and start new chapter in life, like all of us do.   Ahh...it's almost dusk now. Time to go and pump few sets of iron and forget about this sadness and shit. So who wants to live in the life of boredom, sadness and gloom? It's time to get out there and join the Exodus of men out of this nasty and life crushing experience.....  Just wanna focus on the good stuff, or else it's gonna be&nbsp;disasterous through out your day.........   "Turn the page..."&nbsp; Garage Inc.by Metallica   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      *yaaaaaaaawwwnnnnnnnnn* yeah I am so darn sleepy. Let me see.....it's 0524hrs now. We are still kickin' in the hangar. The shift is almost done. Few more task cards and we are off back to the Airside. It has been 4 days since i worked regular shift. Kinda miss the 'real' working environment.   Things are well the whole night. No crap and 'non-sense' ....just work and tasks to be carried out. Did my first 24 hrs check just now. Ran over few tasks that needed to be checked and rechecked before the aircraft ready for departure.   Well, guess I have to get back to work, just finished this report and tasks for today. Can't wait to go back home. It rained and it's so cold here. Hope it's the same in KJ too......

      Yeah...it's raining all right. Tonight, I'm in the hangar with these good men to worked on this aircaft. As for tonight, it's 9M-AAT. Work was done sommthly and switfly. By the time I realized it, it's already 0300hrs local time.   Nothing much for tonight, just finishing off my task cards and ICs to be compiled later in the morning. Goodness! I am so darn sleepy. Had only 2 hours of sleep in the afternoon. It's a struggle now just to keep on typing and to keep my eye lids open.   The quiet night doesn't help too...out from no where, the raining cloud covered KLIA and brought heavy rain. It rained so hard that we hve to shout at each other when we need to communicate. Talking about working in the hangar with zink roof..shucks!! Ahh...it's cold! and I am damp from the rain when i went to ease myself just now.   Looking back on what happened in the day, there's nothing much actually happened today. Just met up with few friends in church. Joel, Liza, Thomas and couple of people here and there. Then there's the part where I had to go and send the INTI student back....The long drive was fine, it's just that I was totally sleepy while driving. But thank God that I was aware of things surroundin me. After back from church..I rushed home, grab some siew pow, took shower and 'landed' on my bed. Just to get few hours of sleep.   Now that I am here in the hangar, with AAT's APU screaming behind where I sit, it's good to hear&nbsp;this&nbsp;machine does keep you awake. The sweet smell of kerosene and the constant swrilling and growling indeed help.  Hopefully that for tomorrow hangar check, it's gonna be the same as tonight. No rush, just everyone are doing their part in finishing all those tasks without [someone] ordering them to do things and stuff.   Gosh, I really need to go...maybe I'll grab a nap to refresh myself..............
