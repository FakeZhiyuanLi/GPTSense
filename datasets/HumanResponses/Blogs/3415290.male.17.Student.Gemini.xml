      You cannot truly understand the greatness of God's strength until you first realize the greatness of your very own weakness.

                                   Written by John W. J. Staub            &nbsp;          Before I begin this article, I would like to give anyone who reads this a bit of background info on me.      I am a 17 years old and have never kissed any girl. When I was 12, I made the commitment to God and myself, that I would completely save all forms of physical intimacy for my wife until my wedding day, including my first kiss. Now, I had no idea to the vastness of what I was committing to at that point. Over these past 5 years I have only by the grace of strength of God stayed true to these commitments. But as you read these next couple of paragraphs, I hope you will see that what I write I do not   only   write, but also live as a lifestyle. The questions I will present to you here are simple. Yet, steer away from their simplicity and you may find yourself in very deep philosophical waters. I do not wish to create theories or enforce rules. All I desire in this is that people think further than they have about this subject before, and that they open their minds to the possibilities of new ideas; ideas that   may   change your life.           &nbsp;          My first question is: What is a   kiss  ?      Is it simply when two pairs of lips meet? Is it when those same lips are brushed softly on a cheek? Or is it when two pairs of lips are pressed together, separated and the tongues collide and caress each other? I will not answer these questions as definite, but merely as my own personal conviction. My commitment is to keep my lips to myself entirely. I believe that I should not separate one kiss from another. A kiss is a kiss. Now, I do agree that when you are not   romantically   involved with someone, such as family members or those you feel as family, a kiss changes it&#8217;s emotional meaning. But it is still indeed a kiss. Then a second question arouses from the first:   What   is a kiss? Is it the showing of a strong loving affection of two friends? The outward display of an inward feeling? Or is it the acknowledgement of two lovers ready to unite and become one? I believe that all of the previous statements, dependant on the variables of each individual relationship. I don&#8217;t think anyone could (or should) kiss their mom or dad with the same emotional and physical intimacy they would with their husband or wife. This brings the idea to light that every kiss is different dependant on the moment that it is made. To me, there are just too many variables involved. Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t want to trust myself to those ever-changing circumstances and the dangerous possibility of compromise. Why should I willingly put myself in circumstances that will tempt me?           &nbsp;          This brings me to my next thought.      I have long believed that sex is a complete act; from start to finish. I just recently came upon this article that properly displays my viewpoint. It may be a bit extreme, but sometimes you need extremity to produce productivity. John White writes:           &nbsp;         &#8220;Defining coitus in terms of penetration and orgasm has as much moral significance and as much logical difficulty as trying to define a beard by the number of hairs on a chin . . .&#8221;           &#8220;I know that experts used to distinguish light from heavy petting, and heavy petting from intercourse, but it there any moral difference between two naked people in bed petting to orgasm and another two having intercourse? Is the one act a fraction of an ounce less sinful than the other? Is it perhaps more righteous to pet with clothes on? If so, which is worse, to pet with clothes off or to have intercourse with clothes on?          You may accuse me of being crude. Far from it. If we continue the arguments far enough, we see that the morality of premarital sex that is based on the details of behavior (kissing, dressing, un-dressing, touching, holding, looking) and parts of the body (fingers, hair, arms, breast, lips, genitalia) can only satisfy a Pharisee. A look can be as sensual as a touch, and a finger brushed lightly over a cheek as erotic as penetration.&#8221;   - John White, Eros Defiled (Downers Grove, Ill.: Intervarsity Press, 1977), 53.             &nbsp;          This excerpt caused me great thought.      If indeed a look can be as sensual as a touch, have I ever looked any girls in that way? I pray that I haven&#8217;t and do not believe I have. But the reality of those simply stated three paragraphs have much theological depth to them. I completely believe with Mr. White in that sex is   much   more than just intercourse, it&#8217;s everything combined into one complete unit. It includes body-language, looking with the eyes and even the emotions. This is why I believe Jesus said, &#8220;. . .      anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart     .&#8221; If even the looking of the eyes is the beginning of sexual intimacy, then how can a kiss (or any other form of physical affection)   not   be of that same nature?           &nbsp;          But finally, I will say this: The greatest and most important fact is that God   must   be glorified in whatever circumstances of your relationship.      I am not saying kissing doesn&#8217;t glorify God, nor am I saying that it glorifies God   more   than not kissing. I simply ask these questions to make you think. To make you think deeper and more specifically. My hope is that God will speak to some of you and move your hearts through reading this and it will spur on a new desire for sexual, emotional and spiritual purity in your lives.           &nbsp;

       Written by John W. J. Staub    Many questions arise among teenagers today regarding the end of the world.  What is it? When will it happen? Will we be here? Could it happen today, or tomorrow? All of these questions I also personally held as of a few years ago. However study and teaching have helped narrow these questions and bring some distinction to all of these unknown possibilities. In the following text that you will read below, I will not try to venture out into the analysis and translation of Revelation. Nor, will I try and tell you any of the specifics that will happen when the end comes. This text will be solely dedicated to what we, as Christians, must do now and to what must happen here on earth before the end can come.   As a young Christian boy, I grew up going to Sunday school every week being taught about the very simple and elementary truths of the bible and of God.  Many of these teachings were true. But some of them were made out of misunderstandings of the Bible, particularly one. This is the same teaching held also by a large majority of the Christian population. You may even hold this thought yourself. It is this belief: Jesus could come back any second and we must live our lives as though he is coming back tomorrow! This concept however, is untrue and unbiblical. No where in the bible can you find any basis for this idea. However, many of the verses used to teach this belief are taken out of context and are read out of great misunderstandings.   I first will begin my belief with this statement: Jesus Christ cannot return now.  You may be shocked with disagreement or fantasized with puzzlement, but I beg you either way to hear me out. Let’s look at Matthew 24:14, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” In this verse, the translated word “nations” is the word “ethnos” in the original Greek. This word “ethnos” comes from the same Latin derivative that our English word “ethnic” comes from. So the Greek word “ethnos” is properly translated as an “ethnic group”. A common supplementary name for these “ethnic groups” is “people groups”. Right now, there are approximately 12,864 “people groups” in the world. Among those 12,864 people groups, 6,322 have not been reached for Christ. Now according to the previously stated verse, the “gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations (all people groups), and then the end will come.” God is Sovereign and mighty in all ways; never changing. People may ask this question, “If God is Sovereign, can’t he just do what he wants?” The answer is definitely yes. However, when God makes a law, He cannot break that law. It completely goes against His nature. He is the same yesterday, today, and for the rest of eternity. He made this declaration/law with His own mouth. He spoke forth this one mandate as to what must happen before he returns.   “What about us?” You might be asking.  “What can or should we do in the mean time?” Well, the best part about this truth is that it is not a hopeless cause; reaching the rest of these 6,322 people groups is not impossible! In fact, it is possible that the closure of the great commission IS possible in OUR LIFETIME! There are approximately 900 church congregations to every 1 “unreached people group” still left in the world. If we, as a generation, begin to unite in strategic development planning for the reaching of these 6,000+ “unreached people groups”, a mighty revival of God would spread like wild fire through the earth in greater proportions than ever seen before. The mobilization of missions has never been greater than the time we live in now!   My hope in writing this text is that it will further your passion for reaching the many “unreached people groups” in the world.  I do not wish that you sit back and say, “Oh, Jesus isn’t coming back anytime soon. I can just sit back and relax until it gets closer . . . then I’ll get serious.” By no means! Nor do I want you, the reader, to feel overwhelmed with the vastness of the task that is before all of us. I merely want to you remember that: the task is before all of us. Each of us must do our part in the reaching out to lost and unreached world. For the end goal of the closure of the Great Commission! I want to encourage you; take that first step into the unknown. You may not know exactly what God wants you do to reach those who are unreached, but start walking. We, as Christians, must ready this earth for Jesus’ return. Each day, each minute, each second must be solely focused on spreading His renown; so that all the earth can know, and then the end will come!

      Sometimes I wonder what worship really is. But then at the same time I am reminded that worship is a lifestyle that glorifies God. It's not a song or singing, not a sound or music, not a movement or a dance, it's not even a thing. Worship is an existence; a mere living. Not a thing you do, but something much deeper that shines through your very skin.
