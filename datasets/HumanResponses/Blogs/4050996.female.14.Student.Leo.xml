        Here's a very meaningful story I want to share. I heard it from   urlLink  Eason Chan    in his Live For Today album.   One day, Tweety was flying up above the sky when a sudden chill freezed him. His wings gave a feeble flap and then fell to the ground, going through a near-death-experience. A dumb old cow came by and shitted on Tweety. Yucks! Then, Tweety felt himself getting warmer and is no longer freezing. He managed to recover and was soon happily singing at the top of his lungs. Then Sylvester heard Tweety and came to dig Tweety out of the shit, and eventually, ate Tweety.   ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who shits on you may not be your enemy.  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who gets you out of the shit may not be your friend.  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut.

          I thought today would be a great day cos' i don't have classes today, even though it's not a school holiday. My class--3C was specially chosen to attend a  ceramah  (i'm not sure if it's called lecture or seminar). It came as a surprise, cos' none of us thought we would be chosen. I mean, we're not the best class there is, we're not the worst either, and certainly not anything special, apart from we're famous because of the silence in our class. There'll be pin-drop silence in our class even if no teachers are around. Every teacher who taught us complained about us giving no responses when they asks questions. So I don't think it is something to be proud of.          Back to the seminar, or whatever you call it. There were representives from UTM, UiTM, and UPM here in SMK Meru, Klang to explain about the courses and faculties offered in their universities, and emphasizing on the benefits of majoring in Science and Technology. They look quite inexperienced to me, cos' i don't think they managed to get all the students interested. Their speeches were long and boring. So i don't blame my friend for not paying attention to the lecturers. Grace and Voon Huey kept themselves busy by discussing about some dance they're going to practice after the seminar, Nusyairah was reading ghost stories, Yin Hann was listening to F.I.R on her walkman, Su Harn checked Shi Xian's inbox messages on her cellphone, Siew Teng actually brought her reference book and was doing Geography revisions...          I was listening to the lecturers all right... while trying hard to control the motorcycle on Syairah's Motorola cellphone, to kill time. Then a big opportunity came for me to escape from the lecture hall. I joined my friends for a trip to the school's washroom.        The washroom is not exactly spotless but it certainly doesn't give out foul odours, like many public washrooms do. I grade it a 5 out of 10. None of us feel like going back to the lecture hall after relieving ourselves. So we decided to take a look at the school's amenities. Not bad really. they have  labu sayong  and all sorts of plants on display all over the school. The school field is big and their classrooms are at least thrice larger than my school's. I took a peek into their  Bilik Jahitan  and  Bengkel  which is very well equipped. Nice lanscape too. Then i walked past their other washrooms meant for their own students only, urgh... It was nothing like the one we used just now. These looks filthy and dark without lights on. It seems to me no one bothered to clean the washrooms since like, a decade ago. No kidding. I wouldn't be surprised if girls came running out of the washrooms screaming like hell because they just stepped on dead cockroaches. My impression of this school will definitely be judged by the washrooms.

          I browsed   urlLink  BookCrossing.com    a couple of weeks ago,and i was totally unaware that there actually are what-you-call-them, good guys on the net. It's just that everyone, mum, dad, aunts, uncles, always warns me, "The net is very dangerous ah, all those ah mao ah gou ah zhu ah niu will send you virus. And then they find out where you live, come to your house to rape you!" Ok, so sometimes things do go wrong. But as long as you are cautious enough not to give others your phone no., address etc. etc., who would come and rape you?

        A friend e-mailed this to me. Had a good laugh with this Chinese delivery!  *For non-Chinese readers, 'ahma' means grandmother and 'ah kong' grandfather. An innovative delivery method, the Chinese ways... forget about DHL, UPS or even FedEx!!! Enjoy Reading :-)        A family in the Southern Province of China, were puzzled when the coffin of their dead grandmother arrived from the States. It was sent by one of the daughters. The dead body was so tightly squeezed inside the coffin, with no space left in it! When they opened the lid, they found a letter on top; which read as follows.  Dear Cousins,  I am sending Ahma body to you since it was her wish that she should be cremated in the compound of our ancestral home in Tung Shin. Sorry, I could not come along as all of my paid leaves are consumed. You will find inside the coffin, under Ahma's body, 12 cans of Yohmeitsu, 10 packets of Swiss chocolates ! and packets of Chinatown Lap Cheong. Please divide these among all of you.  - On Ahma's feet you will find a new pair of Nike Air shoes (size 10) for Ah boy. Also, there are 2 pairs of shoes for Ah Mei's and Ah Lien's sons. Hope the sizes are correct. - Ahma is wearing 6 CK T-Shirts. The large size is for Ah Bak and the others are for my nephews. Just distribute them among yourselves.  -The 2 new Armani Jeans that Ahma is wearing are for the boys.    - The Rolex watch that Lee Ah Bai wanted is on Ahma's left wrist.   - Kiasu Aunty Pei Pei, Ahma is wearing the Tiffany necklace, earrings and ring that you asked for. Please take them.     - The 6 white Polo cotton socks that Ahma is wearing must be divided among my teenage cousins.  Let me know what else you need as Ah Kong is also not keeping well nowadays. I can send all required things when our Ah Kong goes back too............

       From The-Star:      BEIRUT, Lebanon: Four Lebanese truck drivers are missing in Iraq, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.  Contacts are under way to find out whether the four have been kidnapped, a ministry official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.  The official said the four were driving separate trucks, and all had not been heard of for more than 24 hours.  He gave no further details.  There are now five Lebanese citizens missing in Iraq. Earlier this week, gunmen snatched Lebanese businessman Antoine Antoun in a Baghdad street. His fate is not known.  Another Lebanese hostage, Vladimir Damaa, was freed unharmed this week when Iraqi police raided his kidnappers' hideout in an operation that ended with the arrest of three terror suspects.  Other Lebanese have been kidnapped and released in Iraq this year, sometimes after the payment of ransom. At least one Lebanese hostage was killed. - AP  -Oh no....not  again...

       Noticed the Haloscan is still not working? I tried everything, but the f***ing comment thing still doesn't work. Thanks to Andy and Papi anyway, though I still haven't figured it out.  Okay, forget it. I'm going to talk about something happy today.  So, August 4 2004. Two days ago. Not exactly NEWs.  The cute postman dropped two very thick envelopes on my house porch when I just arrived home from school. And they were addressed to me. No surprises here. But I was really happy to get the letters, ah... ok, books. It was the first two books I ever got since joining BookCrossing. Two Stephen King books, in fact.   -   urlLink  The Stand    -  urlLink  Rose Madder       I finished Rose Madder already, so it's available. But i'm going to take ages reading The Stand. Man, they're thick. 1421 pages, imagine that!  Due to trial exams just around the corner, I may not be able to blog as much as I like, cos' mum and dad is keeping their eyes on me.

        From   urlLink  Extraterrestrial-Life.net   :       Not a naive supposition, but a marvelous acknowledgment it has become: extraterrestrial life exists, and is near. Provided we unite all the facts, testimonies and visual evidence, and don't answer to ridicule, a pair of scrutinizing eyes and a good deal of common sense inevitably lead us to this observation: crafts from other planets, made by older civilizations, have reached this world.  Even with UFOs out of the equation, this seems only logical. Our solar system is dwarfed by the Milky Way galaxy to which it belongs. But the Milky Way, containing 400,000 million stars, is only a mote in the universe. There are thousands of millions of such galaxies, most with their own myriad of stars, having their own planetary systems. If only 1/10,000 of 1 per cent of these planets harbor a civilization — and this is a very conservative estimate — the universe must teem with more than 100 million million civilizations.  Not one of them would have reached us? Among these millions of civilizations, can we be the only ones who develop the necessary means to travel through space? The age of the universe, around 15 billion years, is counted in steps of millions of years. Civilizations with such a temporal advance on us will have developed ultra fast space travel, will have breached the distance gap with other civilizations, and undoubtedly will have discovered us long ago. Our own tender steps in the direction of supra-gravitational propulsion and exoplanetary spectroscopy clarify the huge probability that many other civilizations have been using similar technologies for probably tens or hundreds of thousands of years, and are therefore able to detect and reach the kinds of semi-advanced planets that we ourselves inhabit.  Access to the internet exponentially and quite shockingly accentuates this new world view by grouping our own experiences. The world wide web of computers has truly become humanity's super brain, with its tendencies to dominate and lie, but with an overall prerogative for truth and discovery. The existence of extraterrestrial life is, as it now appears, more concrete than one ever dared to imagine. Researchers and governmental whistleblowers have welcomed the internet as a golden opportunity to finally release their knowledge to the world, without having to struggle and campaign, or without being laughed at in cheesy tv shows. Merely responding to search-engine feeding curiosity made these people come out. Their claims — stunningly convergent and international as they are — seem indeed to refer to something real. Needless to say: there is a lot of chaff mingled with the wheat. But after filtering out the incongruent testimonies, and after reading the scientific studies that exist on the subject, what remains contains a direct and uncolored set of facts, reflecting a truth sometimes too incredible for our minds to comprehend: that UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial spacecraft.  It's understandable, having been there myself, that we're not always swiftly coping with the implications of this conclusion. The surprise stands in the way of the reasoned approach. But this inability to cope with the contextual depth of the testimonies and studies on UFOs, is not at all an intellectual deficit, but stems mostly from the originally conservative handling of the subject by our governmental and military representatives. One wrongfully thinks that the extraterrestrial UFO reality could never be hidden from the public. It's obvious that military and intelligence agencies can indeed cover-up information — i.e. prevent it from reaching mainstream media channels. The combination of stringent top secrecy oaths and bureaucratic compartmentalization are a most effective recipe for covering up any unknown phenomenon. The secrecy has also publicly been effectively maintained, from the early 1940's on, by the conscious debunking of the mental connection between UFOs and possible extraterrestrial spacecraft. The incredulity meeting the extraterrestrial origin of these craft stems even more from our massive cultural abandonment to movie screenplays, in which the UFO subject incessantly gets injected with an overdose of fantasy. The theme of ET life has so often been absorbed into this fantastic realm — instead of being studied scientifically — that a serious discussion on the subject has become very difficult.  The circuit is reconnectable: the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs is slowly but surely becoming a respectable viewpoint. On the basis of a series of credible testimonies — from Air Force commanders over nuclear guards to NASA astronauts — UFOs can now be considered as advanced aerospace shuttles from a non-Earthly origin, intrinsically not unlike our own shuttles (in that they are machines travelling through space), but of a remotely advanced character. If we surmount the mental blockade and accept this to be a serious reality, only then can our world view climb up to the next level.  You, dear reader, will appreciate just as much as I did, that the extraterrestrial subject is of the utmost importance to mankind. We are so fortunate to live in an age where humanity is finally but slowly able to envisage the cosmos as it is. Undoubtedly, the acknowledgment of the extraterrestrial reality will have the most profound impact on our lives. It would confront us undeniably with the fact that we all share a small planet, a village which we must manage together and whose resources we must preserve for future generations. With the recognition of the true existence of extraterrestrial life, we can enter the adulthood of mankind, attain true self-awareness and responsibility, and begin to unravel the world of heavens for what it really is. Our genuine cosmic place can only be appreciated if we can recognize ourselves as one amongst others. This truth is the most important jump a conscious species can make. I therefore wish you a stable leap.  Thomas Deflo, MA in Philosophy

       A few weeks ago, I heard Rudy and JLo ( urlLink  Hitz.fm   morning crew) saying that scientists found life on the rings of Saturn. Not exactly intelligent life forms, only things like bacteria. But this is enough for me to say that, if we can find life on Saturn’s rings, no doubt we can find intelligent life forms in other parts of the universe. It’s just a matter time when we’ll find them.  I have been participating in   urlLink   SETI@H ome      since I found out about it two years ago. Now, my computer runs a background program whenever I’m using the computer. I’m thinking of getting a new computer with more power so that I can leave my computer running 24/7 while analyzing the data, without my computer breaking down.  I know that it is probably a miracle that life was formed on Earth, cos’ you know, everything have to fit, like there cannot be too much oxygen, and the temperature must be just right etc etc. But not necessarily life needs what human needs to form. Probably life out there inhales carbon monoxide, not oxygen. Or maybe they need 10 sun-like stars around them to keep them warm enough to survive.
