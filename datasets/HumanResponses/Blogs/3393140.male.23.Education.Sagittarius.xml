       urlLink Self-Inflicted Mullet for 80's party    Welcome to my page.  With this post, I mark the beginning of the end of my usefulness at work. Actually, I am increasingly good at my job, but that's besides the point. From now on, I have lots to do at work--create a lame webpage to glorify myself, and annoy my friends, family, or anyone foolish enough to have stumbled across these hallowed cyber pages. Also, I just want to imitate my all powerful  urlLink Sempai . Perhaps, someday, I will have "fuckbots" of my own.   That being said, I will now explain the stupid title of this lame page...er, hilarious title of the best "blog" of all time. Having very little in my brain remotely resembling an original thought (self-abusive writing is hilarious.  laugh.), I was at a loss when trying to come up with a name. Seeing how's I'm ins Japan ands all, I don rekoned that Engrish would be jurst about right for this here hootinani.  So, some days when I leave, I'll be the last one in the room. On one of these occasions, one of my fellow english teachers left me a note saying, "Chris sensei, When you go home, please tell the office lady to rock the room." I already found this extremely amusing(in all of my native speaking glory!), but found it even MORE so after Andy "Triple Z" said, "Wouldn't it be funny if you forgot something, and had to come back, and the office lady was actually rocking the room?" Yes, Andy--that would be hilarious!!!  So, the 80's live on in Japan!  School-girls, and grown ups trying to capitalize on the out-of-control school girl fetish in this country, have the standard 80's equipment--ie, mini-skirts, garish make-up, and (I can't believe it) leg warmers!  On the men's side, the mullet, multi-colored leather jackets, tight jeans, and wearing big sunglasses at night reign supreme.  Much to my horror, this is the only thing about the 80's that migrated...instead of ripping guitar, hair spray glam bands, or shrieking vocals, we get Japanese elevator music (aka, JPop).  I DARE you to tolerate listening to SMAP!!!  Anyone who says that they actually do is either:  a.  lying, or 2. recovering from a nearly fatal brain injury.  The 80's keeps going.  Here's a photo of me and Katy's cars.  Mine is the red 80's machine on the right.  Well, it's actually a car made in 1993, BUT the stereo system inside has an uncanny resemblance to the inside of KIT, from Night Rider.  urlLink    Our cars and a cherry tree in bloom&nbsp; urlLink     Well, that's it for my first entry.  More to come later.

      Before the entry starts, quick public service announcement:  I just got a webcam and signed up with MSN Messenger after some expert advice from one Jam Master Jane.  So, for those of you back home (or in Japan too, i guess), we could like totally talk to each other and like see each other for (this is the icing) FREE!!!  So  urlLink sign up  if interested. Onwards...  Nagano is known as the Rooftop of Japan, or at least that what I was told or read.  The reason behind this is that Nagano has lots of very impressive mountains (re:  98 Winter Olympics).  What I don't understand, however, is what in particular distinguishes Nagano's mountains.  Other prefectures, such as Gunma or Yamagata, are equally infested with mountains.  In fact, the entire island of Japan is covered in the damn things--it's like a localized outbreak of poison ivy on otherwise smooth skin (if the Earth were personified...i'm so clever).  Anyways, this weekend was nothing special (or was it? ;)), so I'll post about getting naked with my friends in the mountain and wearing wigs.  So, Katy's friends from England were in town--Steve and Caroline (for you Cville cats, Steve looked a freakishly a lot like Harrison).  urlLink    (from left):  Caroline, Steve, Me, and Katy dressed for the Geos hats and wigs party&nbsp; urlLink     Steve's a marine biologist, and they've been travelling for quite sometime all over the world following his work.  He had a conference in Okinawa, so came early to visit Katy and see some of Japan as well.  The night they came in, was the hats and wigs party, which became a great karaoke night.  urlLink    Two Karaoke Titans:  Hiroaki, and Katy&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Nirvana being sung never looked so...er..good?&nbsp; urlLink     The next day, we went out for a hike at Yatsugatake (I think that's what it's called).    urlLink    The intrepid crew, pausing up the path&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Pausing in a clearing&nbsp; urlLink     The weather was pretty overcast, which means that the mountains get shrouded in a pretty sweet mist (like the archetypal shot of Japanese mountains in the movies...japan so mystical, so spiritual...rook at da mist stupid white man!).   urlLink    Japan's so...mystical&nbsp; urlLink     The culmination of the hike was an outdoor onsen.  It was cozy, especially since we were all naked and didnt know each other THAT well (just not in that way, ya dig?), but that's just the Japanese way.  urlLink    the outdoor natural onsen (the actual bath is behind shin--the guy with his arms raised)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    When we came down to the car, it was night time&nbsp; urlLink     All and all, it was an awesome day.  Steve and Caroline are awesome people--best of luck in Edinburgh, and I hope to see you in Britain!!  Now for something completely different.... This is my friend Tyler.  He went to St. Albans, and played lacrosse--so I'm sure we musta met before, but our first introduction was at an orientation in DC.  We hung out in Tokyo as well, and were pretty tight from the start.  Here he is in Tokyo with a girl he dated briefly on a study abroad trip to Tokyo:  urlLink    Tyler and friend in Club Asia (ShibOOOya!)&nbsp; urlLink     Now, behold the transformation that Japan has wrought!   urlLink    HAAAaaaeelllEEEllluUUuuuuahhhhhhh&nbsp; urlLink      Maybe the JET Program, and my immortal soul (by trickle down) have some hope after all...

      Last week, I went to Tokyo with the ultimate purpose of attending my Recontracting Conference.  Surprisingly, the Conference was actually rewarding, but nearly as much as getting out of my bumfuck town and hitting up an amazing city.  Katy and I went down on the Saturday and met up with some of her old friends from Tokyo for some drinks, followed by a big night out in Roppongi at Club Muse.  For you Nagano cats, Mayumi looked startlingly similar to Ha.  urlLink    Mayumi, Katy, Tomoko, and Keiko&nbsp; urlLink     The next day, Katy and I went to a gorgeous park, and spent the day rowing around in boats, chilling with people hawking their varies artsy wares, and enjoying a different side to Tokyo than the concrete beaurocratic hellhole it can seem.   urlLink    Katy and me in park&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    shot of bridge in park&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    shot of lake in park&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Katy rowing in park&nbsp; urlLink     After the park, we headed out to Shinjuku then Shibuya.  We went to some of Katy's favorite spots.  There were these tiny alleyways that we walked down (not even wide enough for 2 people, or even one of the scooter twins), that were dotted with even tinier bars and restaurants (some could only seat 3 people).  We stopped for a drink in an awesome little bar, then headed to an izakaya in Shibuya (which was likewise awesome).   urlLink    Katy in funky little bar&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Katy at "wicked" izakaya&nbsp; urlLink     The next day, the conference started.  I got to run into some old friends, like one Jam Master Jane (my first friend from Tokyo Orientation, back in August) and Robbie (who, for the UVa crowd, worked the bar of his parents vineyard, Afton).  urlLink    Jane and Robbie at the Conference&nbsp; urlLink     I also go to chill with some (relatively) old friends (ie, the Ueda and Matsumoto crew in Nagano)  urlLink    (from left) Brandon, James, Leah, Beth, and Nadav&nbsp; urlLink     and I even got to experience the infamous subway pushers in Shibuya (my ass was constantly fondled.  Now I know what people like Capalbo must go through every day of their lives).  urlLink    Q getting ready to throw some elbows (or take a picture)&nbsp; urlLink     Both Monday and Tuesday night, I ended up going to Club Asia.  The pics from Monday night didn't really turn out that well (or would publicly humilate James and Nadav), but Tuesday's pics are crucial.  Monday was trance/house, but Tuesday was hip-hop.  We started Tuesday night at a shitty party at a place called the Pink Cow, then headed straight to Asia and ended up staying there until it was light.  Me, Jane, Robbie, and Kelly tore that place up!  And that place tore my wallet up...oh well, that's the city for you.   urlLink    Me, Jane, and Robbie at Pink Cow&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jane, Robbie, and MC up at the DJ booth&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Robbie and Kelly breaking it down&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jane and Robbie hitting the dance floor&nbsp; urlLink     I'll be attempting to surf this weekend with Tyler (aka, Jesus, who I wish I had a picture of, but I didnt get a chance to at the Conference).  Wish me luck, since I will assuredly get absolutely battered.   Last weekend, some of Katy's friends from England were in town.  Steve and Caroline were awesome people, and we had a great time at a silly karaoke party, an awesome hike, and an outdoor onsen.  This post is long enough, so that'll have to wait.  Next time, on Rock the Room:  Wigs, Hiking, and Public Nudity.

      I'm at work right now, and on occasion I read the  urlLink New York Times online  to find out what's happening back home.  More and more, I am shocked by just how socially conservative the United States seems.  Republicans love bashing the "liberal press", but I find absolutely nothing liberal about the press that I have access to.   Check out the big news from back home:   "These days, everybody — black, white, rich, poor, urban, suburban — wants to hear hip-hop and reggae. And girls on dance floors everywhere press their backsides into boys."  Oh my  GOD! I am both shocked and appalled!  You mean their rear ends?  Their fannies (the American fanny, not British...although, the article also states that the British fanny is used on occasion).  Not horrified yet?  Well, get this: "On the dance floor of the V.I.P. club, amid a dense, seething mass of pressed curls and rhinestones, three girls faced into the center of a circle and backed their bottoms into the laps of three boys, who grabbed onto their hips. The girls bent forward at the waist every once in a while and thrust their hands to the ground, grinding like that for a while, hips high in the air....The music switched to merengue, and suddenly, the postures in the room shifted. People turned around to face each other. Space appeared between dance partners. They started flirting." Thank heavens they started flirting as opposed to "dirty dancing" and "simulating sex".  Dancing really has nothing to do with flirtation (I'm a little peaved because my A-game consists on pressing my behind against a girl while on the dance floor).  Honestly, this article as just sad and pathetic.  It is creating news about a dance fad that started ages ago, blames it on hip-hop, then has the feeling of Grampa Simpson bashing today's horrific youth.    The greatest part, I have to say, is how the article yearns for the clean, healthy dance of "cheek to cheek".  Now, not everything in the movies is actually true, but I seem to recall seeing films where high school kids in the 50's or 60's were dancing cheek to cheek, but teachers forced them to move apart.  Some films even depict partners dancing with friggin balloons between them!  Now, I might be a little appalled or concerned with youth of there were a combination of the afore-discussed "butt grinding" and the "cheek to cheek" dancing (if you need me to spell it out further, I would call this dance "the pressed ham sandwitch"...or might refer you to "Requiem for a Dream" for a more vivid and disturbing display).  Now, for my thrilling conclusion--Sorry, buddy.  Dancing is, has been, and always will be "tainted" with sexuality.  He says the merengue tones kids down, implying that it has nothing to do with sex.  The very rhythmic nature of dancing--the excitement--touches human sexual nature, and if that ass-clown had ever seen people really dance the merengue, he would see some impassioned people.  Maybe he's right though--we should all start dancing in classical ways.  I would dance the waltz--that is incredibly unsexy because it makes me want to puke from all that spinning around (certainly nothing sexy about watching your date puke, or puking on her...at least, not for me).  How bout the tango?  Cheek to cheek, with no sexual content.  Just watch "True Lies"--nothing sexxxxxxy about that at all.  Next entry:  Tokyo Re-Contractors Conference, with added bonus of gripping commentary on Japan---you know you want it....

      Now, here's the part where I write really witty, insightful, and hilarious things about Japan.  However, I am not feeling witty, or I'm just not witty to begin with (you decide).  This post is mostly just to post some pictures for people back home--these are the people that I hang out with (note:  if you did not get an individual picture, it's because I don't actually like you...just kidding, it's because I haven't figured out how to change the size of the pictures so that the page doesn't look quite so retarded--and don't worry, you'll be put up later).  There is one thing that I will note that has plagued me since my arrival in Japan:  the ATM's.  In the land of the rising sun, most ATM's close at 3:30, and are not open on weekends or holidays.  This means that if you have a job, like I supposedly do, then you have to use an hour of your vacation time to get money for day to day survival--and, yes, you need cash because credit cards aren't used very often (I've never seen a Japanese citizen use one).  I'm fortunate enough to have an ATM which stays open to the unholy hour of 7:00pm--DEAR GOD, IS SO RATE!!!  BUT, it charges 150 yen (about a buck fitty) per use, and more on weekends and holidays. After much contemplation, I decided the rational, or at least a positive aspect to this practice, is that it reduces crime.  It ain't cool going to the ATM back home when it's dark out.  So I guess no one gets robbed, but for fuck's sake, but those muggings happen late at night!  Overall, the whole POINT of the ATM is for it to be CONVENIENT.  Leaving work early, or running to the bank from my apartment, is not convenient.  In fact, it's the opposite...what's the word i'm looking for?  Oh yeah, a pain in the ass.  Seriously, it burns me every single time I go to the ATM and have to pay a LATE fee for going at 5 in the afternoon.  And AND my card doesn't work at all my bank's tellers, and won't work at another bank's either (not like back home, where we get charged exhorbitant amounts).  Alright, I'm gonna stop talking about it before I lose it and either smash my computer, or experience the exhilarating thrill of my head exploding.  Enjoy the pics, more posts to come later.     urlLink    Me and Katy at karaoke in Cote d'Azur&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Mark and Michelle (M&M) at karaoke in Cote d'Azur&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Brandon "V-stash" Lindsey--beer make Vstash happy!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Heather and me&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      urlLink Galvin, my sempai (what a great example)   &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The whole Saku crew, after taking over a train and heading to the Onbashira&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The Onbashira (translation:  crazy log riding festival)&nbsp; urlLink

      Two weekends ago (sorry, hard to find the time--surprisingly--to fully update), I went to the 2004 Nagano All-Star Baseball Game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Katy and I got tickets because Aika's (one of Katy's co-workers, and the nicest person on the face of the planet) brother Shin camped out for three days.&nbsp; THREE DAYS!!&nbsp; I hadn't even met this guy before, and he slept in his car, and endured torrential rains by standing in the bathroom for three friggin days.&nbsp; Really, sometimes the absolutely genuine goodwill of people in Japan astounds me!!  &nbsp;  Now, I've been to baseball games in the States.&nbsp; I mean, afterall, it is the "American past time", right?&nbsp; So I've seen my Orioles play, and I've even seen the Yankees get their butts kicked by the Mariners in Yankee Stadium (a routing which I took particular satisfaction from since I hate the Yankees), BUT (getting to my point) nothing can compare to seeing a game in Japan.&nbsp; Seriously, the enthusiasm (or mania, if you prefer) is quite shocking.&nbsp; Every is issued (purchases) empty bats to smack together in pre-ordained routines, while singing different fight songs for their specific teams (different songs for different plays AND players).&nbsp; Sounds a bit much, but it is seriously so f---ing cool and fun.  &nbsp;  Aika's whole family is unbelievably awesome (that's like, um, awesome to the fifth power or something....and that's a lot of awesome)!&nbsp; It was one of the best days I've had in Japan, and in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really think that there's anyway that I can fully repay them, but I did give them my baseball, and maybe making a Persian food feast will be a step in the right direction (that's my solution to everything--shove food at it and maybe the problem will go away.&nbsp; That's how I survived for two years on a raft with a rabid giraffe, a kodiak bear, a yak, and the vicious kodiak marmaset).  &nbsp;  On to pictures--enjoy!    urlLink    Katy and Aika at the stadium in Shinonoi (looks like a flower)--GO TIGERS!!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Aika and her family: (from bottom left to top left--Kei, Aika's mom, Aika, Dai, and Shin)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Us and our front row lawn seats (left-center field)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This dude here gave me tossed me up a baseball do to my enthusiastic chants of "U.S.A."&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Have you seen my basthball?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Pretty good ad for KFC, neh?&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    Never seen a stadium quite like this...absolutely stunning.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Shin preparing to launch off the screamer at the bottom of the 5th (or maybe seventh...i forget)&nbsp; urlLink     So that was two weekends ago.  Now, on to the afore-promised (if the handful of readers out there remember) evidence of my amazing impact as a teacher in Japan.  The following are selections taken from my 3rd Graders Writing Tests.  The theme as write a "fan letter", and before you think I am just trying to publicly hail myself as some sort of Gaijin God, it should be noted that this is a test, and the kids are clearly blowing copious amounts of smoke up my ass.  I meant to include one that even acknowledges this, which basically says everything that the one's below followed by, "Of course, all this is jokes.  I don't mean any of it."  Without further adieu, enjoy my meaningful impact....   urlLink    Now isn't this nice?  Really makes one feel that a difference has been made, right?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    How bout this one...don't know why I need luck on my face, but maybe something is going to happen that I don't know about.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This boy is just very confused, it seems.  Make up your mind!  Do you want to be as buff as me (for the record, I have never been buff, nor do I think I have, and I've lost 15 pounds since moving here)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Another angry "fan"...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Now this one is actually remarkably advanced in creativity (although I have no idea who Gager is, or what it means).&nbsp; urlLink     So that's my teaching, at it's finest.  This entry, thus far, has not been true to the theme of this page.  Barring a couple of mullet's that might be in the background of the baseball pics, I feel as though I have let the mullet-crazed fans, which I know you all are, down.  HOWEVER, check out this beaver paddle and the aftermath, artfully created by yours truly...   urlLink    "Three point stance=best mullet pose," say Brandon (and who has a mind to disagree?)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Sassy anyone?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Ladies and Gentlemen!!  I give you, Brandon "Scott Maynard" Lindsey&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    JEEEsus CHRIST why dont you come save my life now...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The coup'd'gras:  If this room's a rockin, don't come a knockin.&nbsp; urlLink     NEXT on Rock the Room:  Sunshine and Sushi.

      Considering that it's Friday, I thought that now would be a good time to write about last weekend.  I apologize (to the three people that read this) for the lack of updates, but I had one masterfully constructed post that hinged on several photos which I have lost.  Gomen.  Anyways, last weekend started off with a trip to Nagano City for the leaving party.  Got to see off some good people, and, as is the habit with all you can drink affairs, to consume a few drinks.  Mark, Harold, and I then grabbed the last train back to Saku to hit up Rajabi's brand new bar--Di Dar.  Good time was had by all (pictures pending).  Saturday's first event was a wedding in beautiful Karuizawa (and it fits with the big city title cause they are moving to Tokyo--so shut it).  Takeshi, one of Katy's former (and best) student, got married to one of Mochizuki Junior High School's (where Andy works) English teachers.  We weren't exactly organized, so we actually missed the entire wedding (boooo!!!!), BUT we made it just on time for the reception.  The wedding (reception) was quite Western style, but just like anything else here, it was also decidedly Japanese.  For one thing, they had two separate wedding ensembles (must've cost a fortune!)   urlLink    1st Outfits&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    2nd outfits (and all of us--from left:  Katy, me, Takeshi, Mayumi, Helen, and Andy)&nbsp; urlLink     Not pictured, because she was working ninja style, is the person sitting behind Takeshi and Mayumi that would pull out and push in their chairs when they would stand up to bow.  In Japan, they love cute things, and they love beer--in fact, it's a pretty safe bet that at anytime of day, it's a pretty safe bet that one or the other is within two steps of you   urlLink    or both...(the blue thing is a "cat like robot" named Doraemon--this is the most insane cartoon I have ever seen!)&nbsp; urlLink     The climax:  urlLink    Mullet Brothers, rock on (this picture really doesnt do justice to their mullets--cudos fellas)&nbsp; urlLink      ONWARDS!  That night I went to Tokyo to meet up with Mark Kroker,  urlLink Paolo , and  urlLink Marc Dano .  The plan was to go to this club called "Air", which we did, but not until almost 2 o'clock (arg.).  Two other party goers were also present when I met up with the boys:  Yuko and Flavio (who introduced himself to me by getting in my grill and saying, "I am FLAvio," in a thick Italian accent...classic).  urlLink    Us in Air (from left to back double arms:  FLAvio, Yuko, Paolo, Marc, and Mark)&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Even Prime Minister Koizumi made it out (from left:  Flavio, Yuko, Paolo, Me, Mark, and Marc passed out)&nbsp; urlLink     Wish I could post a video of this awesome break dance group, but I can't.  Instead, please enjoy this:  urlLink    Greasy Mullatard DJs&nbsp; urlLink     When we left, it was morning, but Tokyo still has plenty of surprises.  urlLink    Fake Tan Party Van&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    McDonald's Breakfast Mullet's&nbsp; urlLink     The next day was Independence Day (ie, 4th of July for you non-freedom luvin terra-ists!), and what would Independence Day be without a bbq??  Luckily, Katy's close friends from when she lived in Tokyo, Michael and Cushla, came through.  They just moved into a new place  urlLink    and look at this patio!! &nbsp; urlLink     The sun went down,   urlLink    prompting a fashion walk-off (which Nice Ben stole the show)&nbsp; urlLink     This was followed by   urlLink    group karaoke&nbsp; urlLink     Here's  urlLink    Michael and Cushla at karaoke&nbsp; urlLink     And that wraps up last weekend.  Tokyo is absolutely awesome, but it was good to come back home as well.  Work rules.  huh?
