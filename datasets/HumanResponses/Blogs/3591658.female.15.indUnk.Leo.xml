        You are... WAIT! - you're none of the Sins you're an Angel! Perfect, or close enough, and annoyingly so! Did you always behave so 'just right'. ARGHHH . You can annoy the hell outta people with your attitude, but no doubt your church is real happy with you. The positive side certainly outweighs the negative, after all, you do chores, are smart, are cute, do charity work. Least you know what a perfect saint you are. You just make the rest of us sinners vomit. Perhaps you could break the rules once in a while, go wild - Eat an extra cookie or something. However - congratulations on being the most pure, of the entire human race.    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Seven Deadly Sins Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        ! You are most Like A Sapphire ! Dark, mysterious - but unforgettable. You have a deep beauty. Delicate, and shy you try to stay away from the limelight but often your intelligence puts you in at the deep end. You're like a Sapphire, because, your beauty is priceless. You're intelligent, full of opinions, and not big-headed about it all. Sometimes you need to put yourself out there, as you can be a bit shy. Congratulations ... You're the mysterious gem everybody wants to have and learn more about.    urlLink   ?? Which Precious Gem Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        You're Most Like The Season Winter ...  You're often depicted as the cold, distant season. But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and Independant. You have an air of power around you - and that can sometimes scare people off. You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you rarely let people in if you can help it. You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You Tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure -  and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is.  Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)    urlLink   ?? Which Season Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well..tonight I was supposed to go to my cousins but I guess they need and 'early night', so we're going tomorrow and now I don't want to go because I hate highway one day trips because it takes and hour to get there and time flies by when we do and then we have to leave and take another hour to get home. But I'm being forced to go because my mom won't go without me or she's not going at all and she needs my uncle to get the car fixed. Life is hard sometimes...because now I can't get a hold of my dad to do something with him..like get the skort and some new shirts for my uniform. So I'm a little pissed off right now. Hopefully some RP's and music will calm me down..or my aunt changing her mind and calling back.

        You have wings of  STEEL . No one's really sure why, but at this point in your life you've shut off emotion to the point of extreme apathy. You are cold and indifferent much of the time...or perhaps you're just a good pretender. Next to impossible to get close to, even those who do never see the real you. It's entirely possible that YOU don't even know the real you. You have a certain fascination or attraction to destruction on a massive scale -  disasters, perhaps even death or the concept of the Apocalypse. Because you hold so much inside, one day you're simply going to snap. Then the mask will fall away, and your true wings will be revealed. Until then you will deal with whatever comes your way in icy bitter silence and acceptance. On the positive side, you are fearless and immeasurably strong - not much can crack through your defenses. You intrigue people, who can't help but wonder why you're the way you are. A loner and one who spends much of their time brooding and contemplating life and death - you are a time bomb waiting to explode and create some destruction of your own.

        Angst. You are an angel of angst. Once one of water. But your depression has caused you to become an outcast. You love to be by yourself, as it helps you think. You have always, and always will wonder what has gone wrong. Your soul has been shattered, and your wings are in peices. But that's just you. You spend your days searching for something. Not someone. Though you don't know what you are looking for. You don't even remember who you are. And are always trying to find that person, yourself, your soul. Which seems to have been misplaced.  But. When you find what you are looking for, it will become clear. All tragedy will be ripped from your wings, and your true colours will show. And then, you are the most powerful of them all.  Hang on, keep looking for it is there. Just try not to loose all you hope and become nothing.

There resides in you a true dignity and nobility, and others see you as a worthy leader, and loyal friend. You are often very mature, with a deep understanding of human nature, and you will instinctively encourage and guide others toward their full potential.  You find it natural to express yourself aesthetically and artistically, you may be involved in the artistic professions, a religious organization, or in activities that have a degree of ceremony and ritual.

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.

        You have an animal soul! Arent you lucky! You are very interactive with animals and can understand them even if you dont speak their tongue. The birds arent afraid of you, deer can eat out of your palm, and every dog will roll over for you. As an Animal Soul, you follow your instinct, sometimes making rash decisions, and not thinking properly. If you dont understand something, you reject and push it away, and can get very disastrous when angry. At the same time, youre a very kind person who can make people feel better, and are understanding and compassionate. One of the great things about you is that your rarely jealous, and know that you have to share and help other people if you want to survive this world.

      Well, my cousin got a belly button piercing thinking that she's going to be cool...It doesn't suit her at all and I totally disapprove of teens under 19 getting their stomachs pierced...She's going to get all jacked up and showing off her stomach and another bad thing is she's a picker and it going to get an infection from picking. Now her little sister wants one too..And she's only 9....;_; I just can't get it out of my head. I asked her "who's going to see it except you...No one wants to see your stomach all the time..." It's true though.....I don't know what else to write except that my cousin is a freaking wanna be who can't be herself around others and has to change her appearance in order to fit in. Maybe if she wasn't such a know it all around others she wouldn't have this problem. But oh well, that's life...I guess you could say I hate my cousin....
