       Nothing new has really  happened  today but I guess i could be wrong. I was debating with myself about the difference between XM Radio (the satellite crap), and the regular AM/FM radio.  Personally, I like AM/FM radio better. Why? it only costs as much as the radio u buy. 5 bucks can get you unlimited radio. XM... sh-t, costs and fees up the ass. So what if it's commercial free? Who cares? Commercials on normal radio keep the station alive and gives money to the station to improve their stuff.  Like for example, a local station here, KFNK, FunkyMonkey 104.9FM, they play about 6 minutes of commercials once every hour. why? because they have money from their commercials to do that. Just because XM is crystal clear stuff, the added static (in certain spots) of some stations adds to the fun of it. Who really wants 100 channels of PURE, CRISP crap when if you wanted sports and weather, you can watch the d-mn TV?  It costs just as much to have an XM service from XMStaelliteRadio, Delphi, or Sirius, as it would to have satellite TV. wtf?  Comment on it if you want. I just think XM radio is stupid.

       I can't sleep. dont know why. I cant call my girlfriend, shes in bed. which reminds me... im going over there 2morrow and i might have a sleepover at her house. F-ck you. get those thoughts out of your head asshole. she hasen't asked yet and neither have I. I doubt that both our moms will say yes. But who cares? it's the thought that counts. even if i dont get 2 go, i c her a lot during the day. i walk her home after school, etc. etc. etc. peace out. when i get my website up, ill tell u about it. K? -john
