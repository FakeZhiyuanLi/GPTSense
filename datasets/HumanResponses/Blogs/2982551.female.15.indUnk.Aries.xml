      I don't know, I just don't know. I don't know what I want here. what I do want...or what I think I want...I obviously, hopelessly, pathetically can't, without a question have. It's like a disease. I always without a doubt...NEVER get what I desperatly want. hopeless high school crushes, grades; anything you could think of, if I want it with all my heart, I fall short of it. honestly, what does God have against me? I go to church every week, I even write the newsletter every month for our youth ministry..so God...WHAT DID I DO? Tell me cause I'd like to know...

      All I want isn't much to ask for. I just want someone to give a damn about me. I want someone to go to. to call my "best friend." I want to stretch, I'm cramped, I need space!!!! I want freedom from this craphole I call my life. I just want a meaning. I want to find it now. I can't wait any longer. I feel if I don't escape now, I'll be in the damp life of a suburbanite forever. Deep within I know I'm going places, I know i'll do something with my life. but when, where, how? I don't feel like I have anything to offer society. What would they even want from me? if I offered, would they take it? Who knows, who ever knows. Why can't I be one of those people that know what they want to do they're whole life? Yeah, a lot of little kids want to be singers, dancers, a doctor. I can't sing, I can't dance, and science isn't my thing at all. So what am i good at? I wonder. I guess that leads to the retorical question...I wonder whats next. The motto of my life the anthem of my generation. Maybe i should just stop wasting the "best" days of my life, get off my ass and do something. I mean, I'm trying to learn to play the guitar, (not going to well) I made the softball team, what else is there that interests me? I like to write. but I doubt anyone cares about what I have to say. I JUST WANT A PASSION IN LIFE, SOMETHING I CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT, A PURPOSE, DRIVING ME TO BE WHO I AM. Maybe thats it. I just  NEED  to be who  I  am. that's all anyone ever asks. That's all I'm asking of myself.

      I feel so empty sometimes. Like I wake up and there's no reason To live, why live? Troubling thoughts awaken my sorrow I go through meaningless motions every day Pressure building upon my shoulders Just let it all fall And run away I wish for fufillment I cant satisfy my mind I feel inadequate I lead myself to crash down upon the pavement  Then... I see you I forget all my troubles For just a little while And i realize I find myself in YOU Like a flower in winters grasp Your delicate Our love could break at any minute But let it grow and become something great Something beautiful I forget all my troubles Only for a while  But then... I blinked And like a well kept secret You were gone Swept away in the dust And my sorrow returns But I'll remember What I felt those days And I hold them in the palm of my hand The petals of our love And hope to water them with my tears To grow again  Hopelessness is inevitable Sorrow is present here And as always, I am alone

      GOOOOOD Friday...I have a really busy weekend ahead of me, today I had to go to the dentist, get an easter outfit. i still have to get leg guards for catching. which leads me to the double header i will be experiencing tomorrow...followed by waking up on sunday at 5:00 to go to church for the easter breakfast i have to cook for, to fundraise for workcamp, and throughout all that, i have to find time to study for my physics test. i bet your asking yourself, well...why are you on the computer...you know why, becuase i feel like it. i need liz time. which i don't get all too often because even before me...comes softball and school and church and tutoring and fundraising etc etc. you know the norm. catch ya on the flip side. liz

      Sorry for the absence...I was in FLORIDA, finally a litta bitta sunshine, and warmth. Does the body good. However, because of my Scandinavian descent, I unfortunately find it impossible to get a tan without getting third degree burns first. So therefore, I am about as albino* as i was when I left. actually I prefer porcelain to albino...less harsh. *note: I'm not actually an albino. Well anyways...FL was awesome! Hung out by the beach and/or pool everyday, went deep sea fishing, (caught diddly squat) I even got a hat my dad bought me...it says SHUT UP AND FISH on it...so classically Liz. We also headed out to the Shark Tooth Festival. It was pretty flippin cool if you ask me. Moon bounce! HOOYA! well, what do you know! Today is my birthday, the big 15. It actually sucked. Like last year, my mom forgot to say happy birthday to me, and I had to remind her. Didn't get a card from the parents, again, like last year. And I spent basically the whole day in the airport/on a plane/in the car. So yeah no special "birthday" activities...if you will. Wow 04-04-04, that won't happen again for another...thousand years...good for me, once again too bad today SUCKED ROYAL ARSE. well gotta jet...lates

      Wow, it's been like a month. too busy...school is almost over thank God. Softball almost over...also good, we have a record of like 1-5000, well maybe not, but close to it. Atleast diamonds may be better, even though i'm playing with like all 8th grader cause I didn't make the dumb age cut-off. GAWD. Just my luck..right? yeah, so we have to read the never ending book that is the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It's ok, better than The Miracle Worker, who cares about Helen Keller. Wow that was cold. I found a really funny picture of the sign that says what time movies are on...and it was like  Erin Brockavich-6:45 Screwed-3:15 My Dog Skip-9:00  Oh man could that be any funnier. probably. I dont know. Yeah so GOT AN A ON MY PHYSICS TEST! WHAT NOW! Never happened before. I'm not dumb, its just that...science and math aren't my thing. I like words better. So language arts and history/geography. THy just make more sense to me. reading is a bonus, yes it is. and all my friends are trying to find me a boyfriend...wtf! who cares? i'm sorry that i'm 15 years old and i've never had a boyfriend. i guess i should have jumped on the dating bandwagon about 5 years ago like everyone else. have a boyfriend for a week, (complete waste of time) and that would make me a better person as a whole. (in case you didn't catch on i'm being sarcastic) who really cares, cause i definantly dont and it's my freakin life. god damn. it just pisses me off that people think they have to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend to make them a sucessful person. work on yourself before you put yourself out on the line like that. you know? i need someone to agree with me here. unless thats the way the whole freshman class thinks, and it's just me...possible...probably...yeah. that's why once again american culture is freaky deaky. and no one should pay attention to us, and we are the worlds biggest super power because? yeah my point exactly. wow im too opinoinated. yeah much oo opinionated. thats a hard word to type. gotta jet, lates  Liz

I also got MVO (most valuable oponent) YAY! The other team awards it to you after the game, if they considered you..most valuable oponent...go figure.  I had fun, even though we lost all of our games. (Got paired against better seeds, thats how we got 17th)  I'm actually excited to play softball tonight. Unusual...i know.  Gotta jet.

      13 more days till Ludo, I can't handle the wait. I hope we get to hang out with them after the show. I hope I get to  meet  them to begin with. Oye.  Today was utterly, insanely BORING. Got home from VBS, which whom supplied us with a crazy good luncheon for all the helper people. mmmmmm Lasagna, sweet italian goodness. Itlay has to be the greatest country in the world. Delicious saucy supremecy. I must say the dessert (to s's because you always want some more!) was the sweet sweet nector of life. Fudgy wonder. I swear I could feel it clogging up my arteries as I ate it. Premature heartattack...might be worth it. I don't know.  I got a magazine today. It had Hilary Duff on the cover. God. Hilary Duff "I feel pressure to fit into my clothes." Wow, real intelectual there Hill. Did you come up with that all on you're own. How i despise the blonde-haired Duff sisters. Kind of reminds me of Ashlee Simpson. Caught her show on MTV. Riding ont he coat-tails of her sister. That pisses me off SO much. She can't even write her own music either. She has to have her "people" help her. How sad is that. Damn their perfect bone structure. (Discluding their noses.)  The word noses is close to Moses.  I think I need to buy magazines that are more intelectual. Or music. Seventeen just isn't cutting it anymore. If I had money, and didn't owe everyone in the world money...I'd buy Spin Magazine. Bought it in the airport. Good stuff that Spin.  Martin Luther King Jr. got shot on my birthday. Kurt Cobain committed suicide the day after my birthday. April is a sad month. That one guy from Alice in Chains too. Is that some sort of sign? No. I need to finish learning to play the guitar. It's to hard to learn by myself.  I gotta jet. Lates Liz

      ok...let's see. LUDO IS COMING TO NAPERVILLE! I have a reason to live once again, Ok not that extreme. no. well anywho, there is about 15 more days left. I can't wait that long. this week is going to be hell. i hate waiting. well i'm doing VBS (vacation bible school) (yeah i know i'm cool) at the debrocks church. i'm with fourth and fifth grade. they are pretty cool people. except this one incredibly weirdo girl who keeps playing with my hair. oh GAWD. and then the other "jr staff" (yeah it gets cooler) girl in my class, is nice, but way to quiet for me. I dunno, i just don't like it when people are quiet. it gets annoying. i like to COMMUNICATE with people. and that must involve talking. unless they are def, then you sign to them, or they read your lips. i dunno. Dan and Sara are working their first day at showplace 12. im proud of sara, entering the working force. her first job! wow! that will be me next summer. i would never work at showplace. see to many people you know there. plus you have to wear a beret and a bow tie. what?! i don't go to the movies to see people in berets and bow ties running around with brooms. NO. this just keeps getting weirder. so today was the boringest day of my life. got home from vbs *cool* at 12:00, then i basically was on the computer for the rest of the day checking out the ludo website and forum. i'm also trying to learn the new dog songs in time for their cd release show. (july 10th) I hope i can also go to the ludo show on july 16th, its the day before i go to workcamp, so I'm not sure. well i gotta jet. lates Liz

      i've never wanted it to rain so bad before in my life. if rains, i'm free to do whatever i want tonight. however, if it doesn't...im obligated to attend my softball game. i thought it would be fun when i signed up, but since i did not make the stupid age cutoff, i have to play with ALL eigth graders. i don't remember if i said this or not, probably. this is the only way i can complain. if i tell my mom it sucks, she'll get pissed off that she spent 500$ for me to play on diamonds, when i don't like it. so...im keeping my mouth shut. yesterday, the game did get rained out, YES THERE IS A GOD! so i went to the dog and everything show (amazing as always) and plain white t's (for the first time) plain white t's totally rocked it hard. the lead singer was crazy hot. they basically all were hot. i so want to go out with a freakin rock god. that would be amazing. i'm not going to lie to you, if i fall in love with somone who doesn't play guitar...im teaching him. so back to last night, it was like 3 hours of crappy bands...like emeeipryean or something of that sort, they actually weren't that bad, i've seen them before, they were better before thought because the power went off like 5 times during their set. i felt kinda bad for them. then it was emanuel who every five minutes would be like FUUUUUUCCK! and me and katie started playing rock paper scissors during their set, and afterwards, the bass guitar player took his water bottle and soaked us. you're only alowed to do that if you do good...HELLO! then was saraphine...they were ok, except the girl next to me was like turning to her friends, singing, then turning back to the stage, and i have like whip burns from her ponytail, i swear to god, if she had done it one more time, i was gonna rip it off. and the girls behind me were like "PLAY NO ONES GIRL" after every song, and it was an hour set, so by the end of the set i was like "JUST PLAY IT ALREADY" so that was not an enjoyable experience for me. but then the dog came on, and i was just as happy as can be, and then some kids started a mosh pit of utter and complete chaos, and it was strictly said NO MOSHING, NO STAGEDIVING, NO BODYSURFING...which by the way means NO FUN. and it was all good. and then plain white t's came on...amazing. first time seeing them. they rocked. i came home and listened to them, i didn't care how late it was, i just listened to them forever. i was surprised i knew some of the words cause i havn't litstend to them in over a year. good stuff. i gotta jet (haha, they're playing on the tv right now) later.

      So Friday...completly amazing. went to a ludo/dog and everything concert...one of the best days of my life. LUDO played first...AWESOME...Andrew was hilarious. The rest of ludo, rockin it out steady. We got to sing 2 solos in "Girls on Trampolines" We had good seats for The Dog. 2 drunk girls behind us...They were slurring their words and were like...sogewrlshooseyewrfavoritememburoftheband..type of dealio, because i believe one of them was "seeing" Dan. or something of that sort. I don't ask questions. During the concert she'd randomly start hugging me and Katie and we'd be like YEAH THE DOG! Just to get her off our backs. and then there was a chain smoker sitting next to Katie, she'd light up every 5 minutes, and then she pulled out a lighter twice during the show, and I swear, I thought she was going to set Katie's hair on fire. Then she got on stage and the roadie and to like tell her to get off...classic stuff. I was more excited to see LUDO however because, they just rock. i've seen LUDO twice, the first time i didn't know who they were so that didn't count, but i did burn the cd off of Kade...and became obsessed with it (in a healthy sort of way) and went to their website, and found some shows close to me...found a free day to go and BAM I was at CREAM OF WHEATON, creative name...crappy carnival..what can you do? It's no Ribfest. or Last Fling. Naperville dominates festivals...I'm not going to lie to you...that is our department. Lenard Skynard/Hootie and The Blowfish and HELLO! SUGAR RAY (kinda random...but i'll take it, i mean he was on I love the 80's, how bad a guy can he be?)...can you get that at your crappy cream-of-some-young-guy? I don't think so buddy. Which also proves my point of Ludo=God and Wheaton=crappy festival thrower, but they can book them, because Ludo and the Dog MADE that festival what it is...ok this is getting kind of weird.  Gotta Jet. later. Liz  (oh yeah Algebra final tomorrow...PARTY...thumbs down)

      i've been studying for finals today...for four hours. i want to get out of this house so bad. lauren lenz and jono stopped by to hang out with my sister, and i tagged along. they're actually really nice people once you get to know them. jon and lauren are pretty funny people. but eventually they left...and it ended...like all things good. kind of like this year. as much as i have complained about it, i trully am going to miss it. i've made a lot of new friends, and have enforced my old friendships. i did things i never thought i could, and i had a lot of fun doing it. i made friends in some of the most unlikley people. people i've known, but have never really  known  them. like garrity, hillary, siebs. I've also just met a lot of new people and experienced so many new things. high school was a good experience, and i cant believe i have 3 more years to have this much fun. it only gets better as you get older. more privlages. im not going to lie to you however, i do wish i had a boyfriend. that's one of the things i did wish happened this year. but just like every other year...NOPE. i see greg and claire, and they've been going out for a full year...and i havnt even hadmy first kiss yet. is that sad? i actually dont know what to think about that. just wait on it i guess. it's all i can do, until i met that person. well anywho...i mean this year was cool, but i cant wait until im a senior, im gonna own that school. im already thinking of senior pranks i can pull. not walking would be so worth going down in school history. i met some cool seniors this year too. my gym leader...cheyenne, so funny. i miss her so much. she was one of the coolest people i ever met. jordan buller...he drove me to a concert with hillary and garrity, but i will treasure that moment...forever. and some seniors i actually never met, but were just like freakin awesome were Brian (Wanhee) Cho, breakdancing, pop-lockingm rapping asian. the crafy william brody, jigger...dont actually know his real name...and the hottest guy in the whole world...who basically doesn't even know i exist...steve minogue...he's in a band...a good band...and he's hot...SO HOT...if you had my year book you could see his amazingy hottiness flowing from the pages burning my eyes out with hot liguid magna hottness. ok thats enough...wow good times...freshman year...not so bad...i applaud you. well i gotta jet, lates  Liz

       Yay! Andrew is coming to Naperville for a Ninja meeting. This is going to be sweet. I don't get to see Ludo until FOREVER. I don't know the next time I'll see them. The closest date they have up on the tour is September 1st...in freakin Champaign. 3 hours away. GOOD.  Anywho, Ninja meeting August 11th at Starbucks. Only Andrew is coming, but that's ok, get to know him better. And that is fine by me. Especially since Ludo one the FUSE contest and they are flying to NYC to make a music video for free. Ludo is getting huge, and I'm so happy for them. But you can't help but feel like a greedy little pig and want them all to yourself forever and ever. But I want the ludo love to spread round.  I also don't remember if I wrote about my ludo t-shirt, I got a stain on it and soaked it, and the ink ran, but no worries, the excess ink washed out. So I'm fine. So if you didn't know before...NOW YA DO.  I saw Napeolean Dynamite on Tuesday...HOLY SHIT SO FUNNY! There is no plot whatsoever to the movie, but I loved it. And I saw Dirty Dancing Havanah Nights last night...oh god, Diego Luna is SO hot. Not to mention the movie was awesome.  I also got back from workcamp on Sunday. It was hot. 98 degrees hot. OK is an oven. My group was nice, but they weren't all that talkative. I'm going back next year, but I do hope i get a better group. AND a lot of hot rocker guys came out. And they were from LOMBARD. Oh chewy goodness.  Gramps is over too. He was here the whole time I was gone, and for the week I've been back too. So life isn't completly back to normal after I returned home. But whateva.  I will marry Diego Luna. DROOL. God bless Cuba.  I also got Franz Ferdinand and Modest mouse cd today at best buy. 21 bucks...not to shabby.  Gotta Jet. Later. Liz

      MMMMM Ludo in Naperville. It was awesome. I got to meet the guys. (except Convy, where was he?) They were all so nice. I got them all to sign a t-shirt for me too.  I have to say Andrew was a sweetie to us. He talked with us for about 10 minutes. And I walked away all giggly. That guy is one of the funniest people in the world. Matt was extremely nice too. I was the only one jumping up and down I swear. I saw Marshall laugh at me. I must have looked cool! Andrew signed my shirt-liz, Rabbits and Bananas. I love your mother. When Hillary was buying a t-shirt Andrew asked how many l's were in here name and she was like...1...and Katie was like...NO Hillary there is 2. Classic. And then I was like...yeah my biggest fear is drowning, or getting shot. And then Andrew was like..well then dont live in an underwater ghetto. WHERE THE HELL DOES HE COME UP WITH THIS STUFF? He is my idol. And then we talked about my church? for some reason. I was like yeah, I'm lutheran....oh i heard those people are CRAZY!....yeah my church is turning all gospel...does your pastor like have a little cloth he wipes his sweat of with? and scream CAN I GET AN AMEN?!...no, but people jump up and down in the isles. Weird...I know. And then Katie told him he was on her top 3 list of funniest people ever. I can't wait to see the boys again. They are really cool people. Hopefully the girl who told us the times on the 16th show as completly WRONG. Hopefully they are way earlier. Then I'll be able to go. And it will be good. I want andrew to write in the tour diary already. Cause Katie told him its what she looks forward to after they do shows. (I must agree) its so funny.  Then we went to Katie's house for a sleepover. It was delicious. We stayed up until six in the morning. I suprisingly wasn't tired today...HM? We also ate KOALA YUMMIES! I havn't had those in years. They are amazing. I asked Katie for some for Christmas. We were so wired. We spent the whole night saying "I'm John Stossel, GIMME A BREAK!" and to the tune of GWH-You can hang out with your mom, that is if you HAD a mom. Also Lauren's impression of dr phil-Now in order to overcome the obsession, you have to BECOME the obsession, and then REVERSE it. I tuck my two little boys into bed every night and i tell them, how lucky I am to have the 2 greatest boys in the world. Now to take you away from all of your problems ie. being pregnant and being 15, WE'RE SENDING YOU SCUBA DIVING! Good god it was fun.  That was one of the best days of my life. Except Ludo only got to play for 25 mintues because the first band ran over their limit. They suck. they got 45 minutes...ludo got 25 and so did saraphine. No one even came to see them.  Gotta jet. Later. Liz

      Man-o-man   This is a very sad day indeed. I just got an e-mail...and e-mail from a certain cricket. Saying that the ninja meeting is canceled for Wednesday. It's so sad. But they will be in NYC shooting their FUSE video. So it's all good I guess. It's for a good reason. But I was very excited to see Andrew, and he was possibly bringing someone else. Whatever. As the Ludo fan base grows in IL, there will be more ninja meetings. SIGH. I'll get over it.  GAH. Liz.

      SIIIIIIIIGH.  I woke up early today (10:30) so I could go to church for 11 o' clock service. However, my mom wouldn't let me in the car because my hair wasn't dry all the way. I  choose  to go to church, and for most parents that would be enough. But not mine...no siree. Urgh. Suckfest. So now I woke up early for nothing, and I have to go to IGNITE tonight. It's still church, but it doesn't have enough "structure" for me, I guess you could say. Makes sense to me.  Haha that's funny....suckfest...  DeBrocks are home and Sara might come to NCHS for school! How tricked out would that be. She went home today though. She's going to make her decision there. And she'll come back, either unpack, or pack the rest of her stuff. She going in to talk to the counsler during registration week, to see if all her credits would transfer ok. But I get my schedual early. On Monday...Katie's mom works for Central. So I get the hook up.   Hahaha....tricked out....this is the best entry ever.  Well nothing has really happened today because it's morning....I havn't been awake in the morning since...school. Shit.  That's good enough for me. Ta Ta! Liz

      Wow, First place for Wild Card. Greg Maddux...win 300. He's the man. 22nd pitcher in the History of Baseball to collect 300 wins. G-G-G-GREG! Sox are in 4th place for wild card. HA HA! Cubs rule. Corey Patterson...good show old chap, 2 run shot. We are 11 games back from the Cards however. Blah. Damn Cards.  I'm officially broke. I only have 11$. I need new school clothes. I don't feel like going with my mom. She always picks up stuff I wont wear. DO I LOOK LIKE I'D WEAR A PONCHO? Ponchos are ugly. Never buy one. I actually think it will be hilarious to see people in ponchos on the first day of school. I'm already laughing.  I have to watch the Bohn's dog, Daisy, for the week. Fun...atleast I get payed. I hate Daisy. She smells and she always whipes her butt on the carpet. Sick.  I think I'm going to Chuck E. Cheese's for dinner tonight. Pimp. My sister works there. I wish she was Chuck. She's the ticket collector/prize-giver-outer. She has to wear a Hawian shirt to work every day.... sucker. Watch, next summer I'll get stuck working at some equally crappy place, if not worse. I don't think I can play softball next summer if I have to get a job. Meh. Softball started to grow on me this summer. I'm playing in a fall league too. So that should be fun. Same team.  I'm ready to go back to school. And I'm happy to not be a freshman.  AH! I got my hair cut. It short. Quite short. Not like...up to my chin...it's shoulder length. I like it. It's cool. I want to dye it brown with a reddish hint in it. But my mom wont let me. What's the big deal? I'm Liz Knutsen, GIMME A BREAK! Katie, Lauren and I saw him on TV last night. We laughed for a long while.  That's all for now. Liz.
