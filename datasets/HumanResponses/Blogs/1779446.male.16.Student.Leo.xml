      Aint I lousy with mine updates.  I'm pretty excited, I have an awesome excursion tommorow and then a camp on Thursday to Mt. Koziosco.  A whole week of bludge as much as I am concerned.  In terms of life.. it's been alright. Not too bad I reckon. I've nearly finished my assignments and stuff. I only have a drama performance left.  My drama performance is from Othello, with two of my friends, Hansen and Ayesh. Being Iago, (The evil villain who maniuplates Othello into killing his wife) was strangely liberating, and from what feedback I heard, I am genuinely good at being evil. (Maybe a new passtime I suppose?)  I enjoyed my extra hour of sleep as clocks were wound back for Daylight Savings. Been playing a game called N. It's a stylish platformer that is very very stylish, did I mention it was stylish? It's only 800kb so yeah, pretty worth while.  http://www.gamehippo.com/download2/download2_1945.shtml  Well thats my rantings for now, I won't bore you to tears with a large chunky post.  Goodnight! (I should really stop posting so late at night)

      well , this is my first proper post.   since this IS my first post, what should I do? Maybe I should introduce myself, or maybe I should bore you with the details of my day to day life, or MAYBE I could chronicle and outline a particular obession or bitch on about war and politics.  Well maybe I won't.  Well, I might as well introduce myself.  My name is Colin, and I'm 15 but 12 at heart. I live in my jeans, and sneakers. My interests include: music, Piano (I'm in grade 7 piano level), acoustic guitars and writing. I love the smell of freshly baked bread and playing cards. I like to waste my time on a sunday afternoon by idly strumming on my guitar or having a jam on my piano. My favorite colour is purple or blue and my favorite drink is Powerade (Coffee, technically is a BEVERAGE :). ) Well thats it for now.  Cheers!  Colin

      I watched the first half of Kill Bill vol. 1 today. It is gory, stylish, cool, rude, diturbing and has a kickass sountrack. Tarantino, I bow to you.

      I am tired. So tired. Slept at 2 woke up at 7. So much work. I finally finished now I have to find some stimulus. Life is boring...  Actually, I MAY have something to post.   Well, I am part of a debating club or thing that meets every thursday and tuesday. Any way, we had a debate today between two teams. The topic was "The west is our past, our future lies in the east". You can probably guess, it started off as a plausible debate which disintegrated into a politically incorrect, racist argument on whether Asians were better or Whites were better. I'd like to quote Maddox "Oops! You're a racist,".   Cheers,  Colin

      It's funny how quick the holidays went past, and how in saying the afore statement, make me sound like a corny cliched narrator of a brainless, do-gooder teen series.  Any how, as I said, they went by pretty damn fast, it seemed only two days ago that I went fishing.... wait... it WAS only two days since I went fishing.  RIGHT NOW. I am being screwed over by my VD project. I've got a throbbing son of a bitch of a headache it is almost one in the morning. School is as usual boring and pointless. I am also suffering from bloggers block. I think I'm suffering mental constipation, a possible exlanation for why my head is killing me.  Karina... I don't know what her problem is, but all my feelings for her have gone, but a tinge of regret still stays, WHY DIDN'T I DUMP HER EARLIER? Ah well. I'm not some player or sex god, but I needed to break away from her. Anywho, how wierd does the last day of the holidays felt? ( I know my tense is all screwed up, but I can't be fecked). It's like enjoying your last meal before execution (a brilliant analogy by Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes.) I don't seem motivated to write anymore, I've picked up my classical guitar and right now I am trying to master the mid section of classical gas. I've noticed my technique has improved...  sorry to cut this short, but I'll being ushered of the comp due to a mother of all migranes.  Cheers,  Colin.

      This really rocks doesn't it. Actually it doesn't, I am sitting here with a stomach bug at Parramatta Library.   EDIT: Phew. I made it. No thanks to some incosiderate asshole who was sitting there for half an hour doing god-knows-what while I had to wait outside the toilet jumping up and down and pace around whilst trying to control my bowels. Damn, I think some of the butter I ate was bad.  Anyways, since this is a post I made at the library in the morning, I gotta keep it short and sweet. I'm here for some research assignment that has been screwing me over. The words "geography" will eternally haunt me. It's the last day before I go back to school, the last day of freedom... it's a sobering and depressing thought. Ah well, it's only 11.00 am and I've finished all my work. Might as well twiddle my thumbs....  *twiddles thumbs*

      Read it and weep me hearties!  Your pirate name is:   Bloody John Cash  Every pirate lives for something different. For some, it's the open sea. For others (the masochists), it's the food. For you, it's definitely the fighting. You're musical, and you've got a certain style if not flair. You'll do just fine. Arr!

      Well it's been a wierdass holidays! I went fishing a lot of the time and most of the time I just bummed around at home. I am panicking at the moment. I have a geography assignment to complete and I am wasting my time idling it away on a pointless weblog that no one is ever going to look at. Regardless, I'll keep on updating.  Well as a blogger user, I've been given special priveledges at gmail! MAD! Thanks a billion blogger!  :)  Anyways... life has been good, it was strange, almost poetic in way. I remeber, yesterday I was going fishing and then... ALL OF A SUDDEN a very attractive girl about my age is walking directly parallel with me and is walking straight towards me! I catch her eye, she catches mine and then we stare at eachother, then she smiles at me. It was strange, maybe it was because of the fact that my sister was talking about fishes weeing into the sea and other stuff like that...  It sounds lame I know, but still, it brightened up my day!

      Today?   Well I went and watched Starsky and Hutch. Very funny film with lots of laugh out loud moments! I enjoyed it. It's not a particularly intelligent film, but nor is it stupid.    Short post, I know, but whey hey! At least I updated...

      I am RODAN hear me scream!  Yesterday I went to Hansens B-day party. Basically, he played warhammer for 4 hours of straight, while I entertained myself on chat rooms posing with the handle "Dalek 69".  Basically, I was a robot sent from the future to pleasurize mothers. I managed to annoy the living hell out of the chat room, provoked some arguments, raised issues about incestuous threesomes. I OWNED this girl called HoNEY, who tried in vain to argue with me. Below is a chat transcript snippet:  --------------------------------  HoNEY: YOU HAVE NO LIFE YOU LOSER! YOU HAVE A 1 INCH COCK!  Dalek_69: Affirimative. I am a nonbeing. I have traveled across the galaxy with one unyielding purpose, to pleasurize your mommy. My apparatus is variable in length in order to cater for all sizes, races and shapes. My purpose is to ensure equality for undersized pussy, like yours.   HoNEY: YEAH YOR MOMMY WAS SITTING aND SPINNING ON YOUR DICK! YOU LOSER!!!1!  Dalek_69: I am sorry, but you seem mistaken, for I have no mother, I am a non being with the sole purpose to pleasurize your mommy. Affirmitive, it was indeed your mother who was sitting and rotating on my probe, I do believe it was the moment of your conception. ---------------------------------------  and so on and so forth. I also used the alias "Mr_Bonerific" in a gay men only chat. I regret doing that, I think the amount of pop ups for private conversations almost crashed Hansens comp.  We watched Kill Bill and 28 days later. Burnt some popcorn. Did more Delta Goodrem Shenanigans, professed my love to Avril Lavigne.  It's all good, I also got a good 3 hours of sleep! WOW!   Logging off now,  Colin

      Well, we meet again mister... or missus.  It's been *quite* a while since I last updated, hopefully I can make this post worthwhile. Actually, I take that back, almost all of these posts are garbage.  So what have I been upto lately?  There was a teacher strike on thursday so me and David Kang went to the city. Basically we went insane, watched a movie and did some lanning, well technically that's what we were supposed to do.  Anyways, it was generally a cool day, we talked, went to comic book stores, ate food, laughed at David Kangs expense and bummed around in the arcade which brings me to my next point, why AZN's are stupid. It's not that I am racist, I'm an Asian for goodness sakes, I jsut dislike the clique of Asians with bleached hair, type with CaPiTALZ in DiFF PlaCES LOL and play DDR and act all hard and read Manga and worship Japan.   They are:   F U G L Y.  Well most of them are. The guys are skinny assed gaunt guys with shades and too long hair. I bet not a sinle one of them have a pube's whiff of a dick, nor a dick at all.  It's been a mad week, but I had a bout of depression. It's over now, and I'll probably be going to Hansen's house tommorow for a sleep over. ANYWAYS, AZN's annoy me, possibly because I encounter a WHOLE damn group of them loitering around the arcade, trying to look cool. Another incident that stands out was the whole Koala woman thing. You see, we encountered a woman dressed in a white mask in the shape of a koala's face. Ok, moving on, as we walked towards the QVB, David Kang exclaimed "What the shit?" thus, attracting her attention and prompting her to strike at david with the strange stick thing she had, causing both Ali and David to say "OH SHIT!" in wet fear simultaneously. It doesn't sound that funny, but I was laughing so much I almost shat my pants when it happened.  Logging off for now, Colin.

      I went fishing today, didn't catch anything because of low tides. What a bummer. But the beach was beautiful. It was a cold day, but it got a bit warmer in the afternoon.   Why are girls so beautiful? Why is it that every where I see I see those beautiful, leggy creatures that seem to roam around with a surreal grace? I think, aside, from cheeseburgers, that I have a new vice. Women.  Is it really possible that maybe love is just plainly a biological recation that takes part inside the brain? What ever it is, it is tormenting my poor moral structure and tempting me with beautiful young pretty things! You do not know how frustrating this is! maybe it's just puberty, maybe I'm in the testostorome laden stages of my life where my desires spiral totally out of control.  The girls ain't helping either. Wearing tight shirts, mini skirts that reveal long, slender legs and supple thighs... crap I gotta shake it out of my head!   Rest assured, I'm not becoming a perverted piece of porn, but it's just a longing, a wanting, for a piece of this beauty, something to hold, to keep me warm. Why do the girls have to be so pretty? WHY? Why are they so intelligent? Why do they always see right through me? Am I caught in a rapture because of something so beautiful?  I can't help myself really, every time a girl walks past I JUST HAVE TO LOOK! Luckily there isn't *that* much eye candy in my school. Otherwise I would be branded a pervert. Heck maybe I am, but I feel that this ain't a dirty lust.  Maybe it's a bit of their ethereal grace, leggy beauty, sass, that makes them so hard to get. So far off like stars in the sky. I always want what I can't get...   Thank goodness for the blog, I cannot possibly keep these feelings pent up ANY longer. But girls are so awesome, they are the bane or my life and the only glimmering dream I can see when I am awake.    I gotta go, I've gotta go sleep, hopefully my mum doesn't ban me off the internet.   Cheers,  Colin

      It's funny how a hair cut can make someone look like a homophobic doofus.   YES I KNOW I AM A HOMOPHOBIC DOOFUS, but I don't need to LOOK like one.  Anyways,doofus or no doofus I'll go on. Photo's coming soon!  I have recently discovered that I am addicted to cheeseburgers. Yes I know, the ones from fast food outlets with meat patties made of anything BUT meat, and uber-fake pieces of cheese flavoured plastic. Yes I am ashamed to say, I am addicted to them. I know it's bad for me, now I know what a heroin junkie feels like. Next thing I know, I'll be in a hoodie, fumbling twenty dollars over the counter of Mc Donalds. After my downward spiral into cheeseburger addiction I'll become an obese nymphomaniac. Then will come my triumphant return from a Mc Donalds Rehabilitation Centre.   Maybe the life of a cheeseburger junkie aint that bad afterall. You like to chacha? I sure do.  Logging off for now.  Colin

      I got 81 for my maths exams today. I was esctatic! Absolutely ecstatic! (I do not know how it is spelt, but meh).   I guess I'll have to uphold my promise with Laura. I'm going to have to play Kings Of Chaos! It's funny how ironic life is. I promised that I would play KoC if I got over 80 percent in my Maths test, which I was not expecting, but yet now I have to play a game I don't really want to play! I could have at least beaten my 80 by six or seven, but noooo, I just HAD to beat it by just one, a mere one! Well, at least I can say now is that I managed to mainuplate God, wait I shouldn't say that! Naughty me. Next time I should place a twenty dollar bet on me getting more than 90 percent. ;)  Colin Zhu, infidel extraoridinaire, going out with a naive, young girl who is in one grade lower than him at the local comphrehensive, who has ADD (an attention disorder) yet flirting with some other girls at school. Talk about despotic, heartless and screwed up. The only thing that'll be bigger than his ego is the crap pile he has backed himself into. I feel so tempted to call up my friend Jason to screw him over by telling Nicole (the girl) about his infidelity and the personal and embarassing stories he told us about her.  It is also funny, the amount of shit heads going around with single playing cards in their hands, trying to perfect sleigh of hand and card flourishes. It's sad, I mean, it's understandable if you do it at home, but doing it at school takes the word sad and depraved to whole new levels. When I actually try to do them a favour by saying "it looks sad and lame and people might think you are stupid". I get a reply saying "Shut up, you're gay Colin". Dudes if I was a gay, his pants would have been pulled down to his eczema infested ankles and I would be ass raping him so damn hard blood would be splurting out of his mouth.  Now, on a lighter note however, I completed my english competition and I'm also trying out to become MC for this years formal. Wish me luck! Sigining off....  Colin

      Muse really rock. My goodness, how badly do they rock? I'd recommend Hysteria, Apocalypse Please and Time is running out.   Anyway, another RoTHE update, I've added sounds, and I've basically worked out the weapons. You can shoot now. Anyways, I'll start programming new levels and adding background music.  I'm going off for some piano practice, I'll update a bit later after I go get some hot chips and an hour of solid piano practice. I've got piano exams in novemember.  I'll be back.  Colin

      Well, I've been studying my little ass off. Screw science. Right now "dear diary" by M2M is plaing in the background. Hopefully I'll be able to d/l the whole Kill Bill Vol. 2 album today.  Essentially, my history is quite sound. But science... I can honestly say I am quite screwed, I know a FEW things, but to study a whole year and a half worth of work? Quite impossible. Imagine how much I'll be whingeing when I'm in university (if blogger is still around, but it's highly probable that every single living thing on this planet will have a blog and be fluent in html. and php. programming and basic trigonometry.)  Once exams are over, I'll be planning to make a freeware game called "Revenge of the sadistic emoticon"  Anyway, I've started to listen to radiohead, Creep is such a good song. I recommomend them.   Well, happy 18th post. I hope this one lasts... I'd be glad once exams are over.  Cheers  Colin

      I love the weekend. Time to relax. But it is also the last weekend before the exam week… I will be dancing when it is over. Year ten is quite hectic. Imagine years 11 and 12!  Well yesterday I went to the src (Student Representatives) annual dinner. We had a great time at the GPK in Castle Hill. Basically we just ate pizza and talked. I wrote a post yesterday, but: IT DIDN’T PUBLISH OR POST! SO I LOST AN ENTIRE POST WHICH OUTLINED MY CRAZY SHENANIGANS!!!   Heres a brief summary of what I did:  Arrived two hours early (I took the last bus of the day which came at bloody 4.45)  Bought the mothers day gift.   Stuffed my face. I had more slices than anyone else on my table. I also had not one, but SIX glasses of coke and lemon lime bitters. I also had, not one, but TWO cups of cappuccino. I think most of my crazy behaviour was caffeine induced.  Danced around.  Took off my undershirt, without taking off my t-shirt.  Forced my self to finish off a LARGE PLATE of the most disgusting Mediterranean salad, I should have known better, but Madeline called me a WUSS! I wasn’t going to take that  >: (. It was painful but worth it.  Discussed about hot celebrities, mainly about Colin Farrell with Alyssa.  Talked about how crappy living in Australia was compared to living in the US. Dammit, why don’t we get cinnamon gum and good public transport over here?  ALMOST got involved in a food fight that was luckily averted.  Saw Goths, heaps of Goths, at the premiere of Van Helsing. Yup, even the posers, who dress up in overcoats and metallica t-shirts. Actually, come to think of it, they were ALL posers.  Hmm… I got to have my photo taken.  Almost asked a cute waiter for his phone number (Yes, I know, I AM male and straight, but Alyssa wanted it, who in the end decided to make me back out)  I guess that’s all I remember, I think I should go out more on Friday nights, well maybe when I get to Uni. I also got my folder today. I wonder what I’ll put on it…  Well the exams are coming and I’ve got to study soon…  It’s been good.  Cheers,  Colin

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nude beach sparks barge flip From correspondents in Austin, Texas May 3, 2004  PARTYGOERS wanting a glimpse of nude sunbathers at the only nude beach in Texas rushed to one side of a barge, prompting it capsize and dump all 60 people into Lake Travis.  Two people were hospitalised with minor injuries yesterday after the rented double-decker barge sank near Hippie Hollow, a lakeside park and the only public nude beach in Texas.  The accident occurred during Splash Day, a semiannual event hosted at the clothing-optional area by the Austin Tavern Guild, a gay and lesbian association.  Witnesses said that all of the people aboard the barge moved to one side as it neared Hippie Hollow, making it tilt.  Krista Umscheid, a spokeswoman for the Lower Colorado River Authority, said that although everyone aboard was accounted for, Travis County sheriff's divers were checking compartments of the sunken pontoon boat as a precaution.   ----------------------------------------------   The article can be found here  http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9462199%255E1702,00.html  -----------------------------------------------   I just thought I'd post this up for your viewing pleasure. I stumbled across it a few minutes ago when I was searching up news regarding "Public Schools". I almost peed myself. Ah, how much can entertainment can one derive from the vices of idiodic americans. OH THE IRONY OF IT ALL!  LOL!

      The weekend is over, the weekend is over...  Exams are in a week. Why our school? It's times like these I regret going to a 'selective school'. It's like the cream of the nerds,  so the standards are like ten times higher than average.  It's Monday. I am screaming. I need to study English, Maths, Geography, Science... five bloody subjects (and yes I KNOW I said "five" where there were "four" subjects, now I know why I failed maths... actually, I WAS right, I have a history exam as well. Shit.)   So I am knee deep in study... I hope I can get some time to blog, but the prospect is bleak.  Screamingly yours,  Colin

      Well I managed to watch Kill Bill 2, which was TOTALLY awesome. But alas, I did not manage to buy a present. I've still got a week!

      Well, it's only 11 in the morning. I want to watch Kill Bill vol. 2 today. Depends on whether I can find any one who wants to see it with me. I also finished the last half of Kill Bill and then proceeded to watch the whole thing again. I still can't get the whistling out of my head.  Anyways, keeping in tune with the unoriginal title, it's been a fast weekend. School is such a chore. I only go there for Drama and English. Maths? Who needs maths? I mean a bunch of numbers aren't going to help you unless you become a aeronautical engineer or some architect space nerd. It's not as if some terrorist is going to hold you hostage and then threaten to kill you if you don't "Find the pronumerical equation of x to the power of 9 multiplied by Cosine over pi, to two decimal places". It's useless.  So sitting here and reading over the cinema times, I can go at one! Hmm... I can buy a mothers day present (for my mum- duh!). Possibly a small paperback picture book called "The book for people who work too much".  I'm listening to Queen right now, it's got a epic etheral quality to it. I don't know how many times I can listen to bohemian rhapsody. I also just realised I can touch type. Holy crap.  I CAN TOUCH TYPE!  Cheers,  Colin  p.s I CAN TOUCH TYPE!!! HOLY SMOKE! I CAN TOUCH TYPE!

      I've got lines to learn, I've got lines to learn, I've got lines to learn. So why am I posting?  Because I'm lazy, unmotivated and have plenty of free time one my hands. Rest assured that I WILL be in panic mode tonight.  I recently joined a youth group called antioch. Well, not exactly joined because I won't be going back there. Basically Antioch is a group of people who sing songs about God and talk about God. Much of these meetings are filled with "hug" times and hand holding and singing to tingly guitar chords from a guy who BORROWED MY PICK AND HASN'T RETURNED IT YET! Let me assure you, the "hug" times, bring a whole new dimension on the word "squishy". Especially because there is this big guy, who is a beast of a man, who crunches bones and eats bricks for breakfast.  This brings me to my next point. Our world as we know it, is being invaded. No not by aliens, but by a race of self-proclaimed "hip" "Cool" "aware" "loving" "communial" teens who call themselves "Christians". It's funny really, how it somehow becomes "cool" to be Christian. Wow. (this next section comes dripping with sarcasm). So to my readers, I am always venturing in ways to IMPROVE your lifestyles. So heres a "how-to" guide to become a self-proclaimed "hip" "cool" "aware" "loving" "communial" teen "Christian".  1) Buy yourself a bible. Not just any ordinary one, but the ones that you buy in COOL Christian bookstores. You know, the ones with the funky layouts, awesome fonts, afterwords and cool reflections!  2) Start going to the Hillsong. Yes, as an out going Christian, you must go to church, well at least, HILLSONG! Hillsong is that place on Norwest Boulevard where you go to WORSHIP God, in the truest way possible... WITH ROCK MUSIC, CONCERTS, DAZZLING LIGHT EFFECTS, FOOT STAMPING AND AWESOMELY COOL ENTRY PRICE FEES! I mean, hey, isn't that what Christianity is all about? Rock music and young people.  I mean, we're not learning to be TRUE christians by going to church at 10 am in the mornings, sitting through sermons and recieveing our Lord in the form of the Sacred Eucharist... Christianity is about love... and rock music. Who ever knew God was so fun! Or music so profitable!  3) Start a Christian blog. Make sure you emblazon it with: I LOVE GOD~~!1!!!1ONE ONE LOL~! and JOURNEY PATH MATTHEW 22:1! or LuV ThY NEGHBORRR! Tell the world how christian you're being by not smoking, not doing drugs, not watching violent movies and playing with random childrenin the street!  4) Adorn yourself with Crosses. What better way to worship our Lord than FASHION! You can not only look cool, but you can also display what a proud child of God you are! Don't skimp on those Kswiss shoes, rolex watches and levis! Let's go dancing!  Actually I might stop there, maybe some people might find this offensive, being the good, honourable Christians you are. I'm sounding quite sacreligious.   Myself? I'm a Catholic, a guy who goes with his family once a week to church, recieves his communion, goes to confession and prays (almost) every night. I have no beef with God, or Christian. I'm sure there are plenty of really good Christian people out there, helping people in need, going to church and stuff. But it's that minority of pimple faced, brainwashed, tween, bimbos that really put me down.  So what was the whole point of this excerise? This stupid rant?  Children, the moral of this story is: "It's cool to be Christian, because it's all about rock music and love and feelings. Who gives a crap about doctrines and church when we could go to the Hillsong?"

      So bored. So damn bored. So what am I going to do? Maybe download a few freeware games or something... how about some strongbad? Maybe. I feel so lonely these days, so unmotivated. I have to learn some lines for bloody drama, and all this other crud.  My sister got her first holy communion today. I'm happy about that, I just finished reading the sunday papers, and now I think my net is buggering up. Fark. I DON'T WANT TO LEARN MY LINES! I DON'T WANT TO PRACTICE MY PIANO! I DON'T WANT TO GODDAMN WORK TODAY!   I'll calm down. Maybe I'll do some work later. I'm not being pissy. Well not yet. I'll just go take some deep breaths and start again. If this fucking thing does not post I am going to spew blood. I need some motivation. Or drugs. Or booze. I'm reconnecting again. Please work. Please work.  I havent blogged for a while. It's been a whole blur.   Signing off.  Colin

      Well, I'm probably making this post short and sweet. What I did today? nothing really. A couple of pages of maths and thats it. I'm probably going to re-log in. Haven't really updated in ages eh? Yeah. I really haven't felt that motivated to post. Lordy. I made brownies again. The whole irony was that my Brownie flopped and became a cake, and the popular myth was that the brownie is essentially a cake that flopped. I feel like pouring my soul out, but, it's just too hard. Everyone I know reads this blog. This is why it is going to die. I think I might be into the Strokes now... Franz Ferdinand is fairly addictive. That's all. Maybe some more later.

Sitting at a computer, trying to think of what to type up...  But seriously, have you ever thought of life? I have. You know what really sucks? I dunno, I'm just bored... nothing to do, I'm pretty unmotivated and my brand new acoustic guitar is out of tune and has to be regularly re-tuned. >:(  Right now? I'm checking my email. I still haven't found a decent place for my work experience!!! ARRGH! I am officially in panic mode.   FARK, life is slow.  Colin

      What did I get upto today? Just bummed around. I actually made brownies. I know, I'm such a chick, but they WORKED! AWESOME! I'm gonna start my fully fledged cooking obsession!  I went to North Rocks Computer market, bumped into David Siow and Ray. Looking for a cheap graphics card I can run Halo with. Right now I'm using "integrated" technology. I got a paper and some minced beef. I also wrote a song today using ancient monster movies as inspiration. Basically the song revolves around monsters destroying suburbia, a city that unleashed the beast.  Right now I am listening to Sixpence none the Richer's cover of "there she goes" by the La's. It's proabably one of the better covers I have heard. They do a pretty sweet version of "don't dream it's over". Who said Christian bands sucked? They do, but Sixpence rock. I need their album. I've had a shower, now I feel so clean and comfortable.  Onto the topic of my title. Why do I need flowers? I have no idea. Maybe because I am ever-so-slowly going queer, with brownies and sixpence none the richer, but then again, the world is, ever-so-slowly, turning gay. It is a sad fact but the "macho dudes" of yesteryear are a dying breed.   Cheers,  Colin

      Well, I just woke up. I ate some really good instant noodles and two left over corn cobs. I just had an apple, I have a horridly blocked nose. Maybe I'll make a trip down to Norwest today and pick up a comic or a magazine. I recently had a debate with Mel about the merits of the USA.  When it comes to the U.S I am a fanboy. Who wouldn't be? I mean it is the land of Cinnamon gum, Comic Books, Hollywood action movies and flavoured cola! Doesn't that justify the war on Iraq? Doesn't that just counter balance Bush's folly?   Indeed it does.   If you think about where we live now, in Australia, the U.S is much more appealing. Why does Australia suck?  1- No Cinnamon Gum, where you do get it, it is shit expensive. 2- Comic books, an issue of Amazing Spiderman takes 2 MONTHS to come out, when it is suposed to come out MONTHLY (and it is a back issue not taking into consideration the lag already). 3- CDs are shit expensive. 4- Our transport system sucks lukewarm ball sacks. Buses come once an hour and usually come 20 mins late. Buses in anywhere else, apart from Australia and Antarctica, come every ten minutes- no- SECONDS- and are prompt. 5- It's boring here, we have no night life. Too slow.  I know, there are much more worse off countries than Australia and that I am quite lucky and grateful to be an Australian citizen. But that doesn't justify the fact that I am a bored, materialistic teenager who wants more. I WANT MY GUM! OR A DECENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM! Australia has neither of these things.   Just give me some gum and I'll shut up.   Colin.

       urlLink Pokemon Fascination   Maan, that was some funny crap. After writing that article they might as well just heft up a swashtika.   What hypocrites!  A quote from the text that Michael made me aware of "The epileptic seizures were said to be caused by the incessant flashing lights in the cartoon overloading the optical nerves and inciting seizure; however, seizures can also be caused by demonic attack."  Do I really need to prove my point? This shit was probably written by a group of Nazi-style Christians. I got two words for this "Bullshit Propaganda".
