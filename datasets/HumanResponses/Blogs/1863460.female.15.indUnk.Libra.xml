      i have this sneaking little suspicion that god is working in my life right now. circumstances are pushing me in a certain direction... not randomly as before. i just wish i knew which was i was being pushed, where i was going. cuz maybe then i could form a plan of action, build all my defensives up... make sure that by the time change comes i am ready to fight it off tooth and nail and go back to my habitual, painful, but ultimately comfortable ways.  it was another one of those interminable days. i am really getting tired of being tired. you know? i hate being this way-- always leaning on everyone else, always needing them to save me. its not healthy. i know. but i don't want to change--- its so much easier to be a parasite. and sure i can pretend like i'm giving something back to you, but in the end it really comes down to me sucking you dry, feeding off of you until you have nothing left to offer. i love you too much for that. but i can't just cut myself off from you completely. i love you too much for that, either. its so goddamn disfunctional.   tomorrow betsy and rick leave for moxville. tomorrow sarah and becky come over. tomorrow i get my permit(finally)  tomorrow the world changes... or does it? or is it, too, stuck in a sick cycle... just spinning around, constantly recovering old ground... making the same mistakes over and over again.   sick cycle carosel this is a sick cycle yah   oh, but on a lighter note, the day really wasn't half bad. i'm just bitching to gain attention.  hey, but at least i'm honest... sometimes.

      her words give me panic attacks like elecrto-shock therapy... supposedly its healing but for the moment it might just make one even more insane. she's not even writing it to me and yet i know, deep down in that part of me that i sometimes call Concience... it was meant for me. that those words, although ostensibly written into the ether, are His lightning bolt into my heart.  i'm still trying to pick myself up off the floor.  its interesting, she always complains about her eyes being so unoriginal... just brown. maybe its because when she looks in the mirror, they never flash gold like they sometimes do when i look at her. those winks of recognition, of friendship, and maybe even more... of understanding. her eyes are as beautiful as Kelsey's-- whose always convey peace. it really is true that eyes are the windows into people's souls. which makes me wonder what my eyes show you... have you ever looked deep enough to find out? or do i always keep them half-lidded, like a window with venetian blinds half shut... so that you can see into the room,but only in small slivers-- never getting the full picture, never totally understanding.  the two postcards were beautiful, they made me imagine i was right there... perfect. oh, but i forgot to tell her the truth... and i guess that's always the case. i shall give you clues, but never a straight answer, because if you figure me out too quickly, i might just have to turn around and face you. and be honest. and what a terrifying thing that would be. for me? for you? or for both of us? i'm not sure.

      last night was relaxing.  after we got home i temporarily stole chris's From Autumn To Ashes cd and put Short Stories With Tragic Endings on repeat... it was gorgeous. (and if you're thinking i'm a bad person b/c i stole the cd, keep in mind that he stole it from betsy who stole it from eric who stole it from...) that song is so perfect for right now. it fits in with the whole theme of my life. most fitting line:   standing so close knowing that it kills me just to breathe you in   how true. why is it that we always seem to gravitate to the things that hurt us most? its like we are just waiting to be burned so that we can turn around and say "i told you it would happen" therefore justifying our bitterness and defensiveness.  what a disgusting cycle.  i had a semi-fight with mom yesterday. she told me that basically, i was being a materialistic bitch who thought the entire world revolved around me and never spent time with my family... etc etc... however, this time instead of crying and screaming back at her and getting lost in the emotional upset, i was pretty calm. i told her basically that she was piling all of her discontent on me and blaming me for things that were not my fault and not true about me, simply for the fact that she new i would be honest with her. if she were to say the same things to either of them, they would just apologize and go right on doing what they do... i refuse to do that. i am far to stubborn to simply bow my head, and so i am always honest sometimes to the point of brutality. because of that honesty, its like she throws things at me subconciously so that she can see the affect. i told her all that... tho much more tactfully. she apologized actually apologized. to me! it was crazy. i almost died right then and there. put that one down in the history books i doubt it will happen again. i'm putting it mostly down to holiday stress. but walking out of the kitchen where we had been i had this glowing sense of victory. i love my mom but we will always be fighting in one way or another.   maddie comes home in 5 days. i can't wait. i am so ready to see her again, and hope that the trip has been what she needed.  you know what i've noticed lately? it can be very suprising to lean on someone who you thought was breakable and instead find them capable. suprising, but not really bad at all.

      "oh, and Emma" he says, "Merry Christmas"  excedrin. yes. whitney wonders, is this some inside joke? a very deep one, my dear. the kind to make my morning. i talk to rachel and for the first time i feel like i'm actually communicating, not conciously holding back.  her eyes speak volumes.  and its very hard to maintain a bad mood in sunshine.  new years eve i know i'll be getting smashed. what else is there to do in this god-forsaken town? everyone comes here to party, and everyone who lives here is just waiting to leave. i'm self-destructive but be glad its slow... you know how i am when things get rushed.  i told him all about the dreams  "you dream very vividly" you have no idea. sometimes its better not to know whats coming... so that i don't have to live with that awful uncertainty until suddenly the worst comes and i'm left in its wake thinking "so THATS what it meant"   fear is the mind-killer. fear is the little death... i will face my fear, i will let it pass through me... I will remain.   i always had this terrible empathy with Lux from The Virgin Suicides, which is not very desirable factoring in her unfortunate ending. but something about her always wanted to make me cry.... because i understood. and no one else in that entire movie could figure out why they had to die, why it couldn't go on. but i do. i see. and it hurts.  becky smiling at me saying "Emma, you're so pretty. like a picture"  yah, pretty as a picture. thanks.      it really is the small things that change one's mind. how could i leave them all? how could i give them all that pain... god knows they already have enough of their own.   suicide is terribly selfish.

      Always, known in, all my time, A little left of center now Reflect as I realize, That all I need is to find the middle pillar path to sit like the sun by a star in the sky and just be. Sinners, casting stones at me  I... I stand, not crawling, not falling down I... I bleed the demons that drag me down I... I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye) I... I'll bleed, (for no one), The demons, (but myself), that pull me down (for me and no one else)  Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out again, sad I'm over, personalities, conflicting, I don't need you, or anyone, but me, I'll just be, living my own life I feel my glowing center grow, infecting I feel alive Shovel dirt over lime, plant it in myself to sit like a seed under covers of earth and just be Sinners, pointing fingers at me  I... I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (by myself), not falling down I... I bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that drag me down I... I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye) I... I'll bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that pull me down (for me and no one else)  Come play kill Refuse my body, refuse my shadow Stond cold will Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow Bitter pills Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow I'm fueled godless  Come play, come play KILL Just be, just be  I... I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (by myself), not falling down I... I bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that drag me down I...

      i really really wanted to talk to him today. but then, it wouldn't have worked out anyways... since betsy decided she wasn't just dropping me off. so maybe its better than just sitting there sipping our coffee, goofing off and wasting all the precious minutes. i really really wanted to  talk  to him, but i guess it will have to wait for another day. betsy and i were joking around about all the people in asheville- how self-absorbed they are  everyone is forward-thinking, but i'm the forwardest    i have 16 seperate ethnic backgrounds... beeyatch!   as we walked up a hill briskly, she was complaining about it being to strenuous. "but betsy!" i said, "we are getting back to our roots!"  "what roots?" she asked sarcastically.... "mother earth and father sky" i replied. "they slapped some pavement on my momma, they slapped it down down down" and then we laughed because i'm sure the people passing by took what we were saying very seriously and agreed wholeheartedly. that is why she hates the people, and why i love them. even when we all try so hard to be unique we end up just clumping together in more eccentric ways.  its come down to last dish efforts now. becky says i'm going to choices, but i'm not sure if i am... its all very iffy at the moment as it usually is. i'm just afraid that if i don't go this month i will have no place left to turn, i've about exhausted all my resources.  i had a really bad dream last night. kelsey called me into the youth office and laurie was sitting there, and then kelsey told me i would have to leave the youth group. i started crying and i stood up to leave. "where can i go now?" i screamed at her, "you've taken away everything. this used to be my safe place.... now i have nothing"  that last statement was true. dream or no.

      no one notices that anythings wrong until you shove it in their face. sometimes i'm afraid this is all just a twisted bid for attention. its so hard to stop shallow--sometimes i get so tired of being alive. when i told you that i don't want to exist, it wasnt a lie. you dont have to believe me-- heaven knows i've lied before. i'm just scared that with all my masks theres nothing left of the real me anymore. how far can we take this? do you really want to push this to the end? i know you can't save me, but i wish you'd try. at least then i'd know someone cared about me as i died. unfortunately, i havent been obvious enough. you still think a simple answer will fix me. havent yet realized that i can't be fixed. some things are just so broken that you have to throw them away no matter how much you lvoe them. but don't worry, i'll leave you enough flesh to buy a better one, dear. this is so fucked up.

      i feel like, instead of stepping backfrom the precipice on which i teetered, i have simply closed my eyes and denied its exiztence. unfortunately, some things cannot simply be denied into unreality. i have tried to use a band aid to stop internal bleeding-- pasting a smiling mask onto emotional mutilation. now i am left trying to hold the peices of my tattered soul together, and i'm failing miserably. what was once a simple wound has become a festering sore of bitterness and distrust that is infecting every part of me. who will sew me back together? who can i trust to cleanse and heal me? i have fallen at the feet of religion but found no relief; i have begged at the door of supposed-friendship and been turned away. the precipice looms infornt of me and the once sturdy rocks of works and performance are now crumbling beneath my bleeding feet. where can i go from here? what are my options? do i turn and face the thing that i was running from in the first place? or do i step off the edge, close my eyes, and fall into the eternal embrace    ....of grace. am i strong enough to let go? am i willing to give up and let him take control? am i pushing the limit or is the limit pushing me?

      i really like this song.(but then, if i didnt, i probably wouldn't be posting it up here, would i?)  Thousand Mile Wish Lyrics  Forgive me if now I wear the face of worry This time alone could never cause any doubt But I’ve been cold too long Such a strange time to find myself coming down as the rain With all the holes my love, To fill up from the middle This storm could stay all night  So can you stay until we close our eyes Til your dreams hold mine Just stay until we know we tried one more time  Cause laughing lovers can overcome their closest demons And they’ll go on and they won’t let go They saw something that they know Has never come so close Can it stay here for us, for now?  Can it stay until we know ourselves? I’m torn as I tell You’re the story that I know and fell from I’m so far into your story I don’t know why We think we’re in control When we lie between the lines  We’ll find a line to follow It’s got to show real soon Or we’ll never each this high  We climb a little further Cause there’s nothing we can’t get around together Further gets colder until nothing was all that I saw around  So we stay until the ground That we can’t come down from splits us away Maybe stars know why we fall I just wish they were thinking out loud Oh, I could wish all night

      my stomach hurts. i'm really not sure what i'm doing sunday for the superbowl-- it really all depends on what the drivers in my family want to do. i sort of want to go to the youth group thing, just so i can hang out with everyone(something i don't get to do that much) but its all the way over in asheville and i think chris and betsy want to go to some other party over here in brevard. i got my haircut on thursday, i really like it-- its sort of 1930's... a little. yesterday we went and joined a gym here in brevard and chris and i are going to go work out this evening-- what joy is mine. but i really do want to get in shape, especially for summer. we are all very good at constructing almost perfect images of ourselves, its like second nature. i think even if i wanted to walk around just being totally myself to everyone and totally honest, i couldn't. this fear of rejection or whatever is way too deeply ingrained.  just tell me i'm fine.

      never really notice the ceiling  until you're laying on the floor  and you're tired of the scenery  cuz you've seen it all before  and the world is spinning softly  just enough to make you sick  like some dirty little deity's  dirty little trick.   never really notice the world  until it knocks you off your feet  and all you can do is lay there  while you breathe in your defeat  and you wonder how things got this way  why everything's so wrong cuz now everyone wants a peice of you  but you're not that strong.   never notice your enemies  until they've stabbed you in the back  and all you can do is walk away  as the scene fades to black  and you cry because it hurts so much you thought they were a friend  but instead they've broken your heart  and it won't mend.

      funny-- when i first heard this song i thought it was a really beautiful love song. but then when i actually read all the lyrics it turns out to be pretty twisted. i think thats the way with a lot of things-- so perfect and sweet on the outside that you're almost afraid to look deeper because maybe if you open your eyes too wide you'll realize how wrong they are, and its so much nicer to stay with the PG rated version.   You've got your ball you've got your chain tied to me tight tie me up again who's got their claws in you my friend Into your heart I'll beat again Sweet like candy to my soul Sweet you rock and sweet you roll Lost for you I'm so lost for you  You come crash into me And I come into you I come into you In a boys dream In a boys dream  Touch your lips just so I know In your eyes, love, it glows so I'm bare boned and crazy for you When you come crash into me, baby And I come into you In a boys dream In a boys dream  If I've gone overboard Then I'm begging you to forgive me in my haste When I'm holding you so girl close to me  Oh and you come crash into me, baby And I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more and show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more and show your world to me In a boys dream.. In a boys dream  Oh I watch you there through the window And I stare at you You wear nothing but you wear it so well tied up and twisted the way I'd like to be For you, for me, come crash into me

      Coin Return Lyrics  I have slipped and I have fallen so far down I can't get out. Overwhelmed by my doubt.  Things I said I'd never do I've done.  Those I said I'd never be I've become.  I have broken - I'm still breaking - cracked and wrecked, beyond repair.  Smacks me in the face every time I fall.  I cannot disregard, with each new fall I hit twice as hard.  Would you be there for me? I would.  Would you look up to see?  I would. falling forward and looking up.

      i'm drinking a cup of very strong black english tea with a load of honey in it. such the best on a snowy night. i went and played soccer in the snow today, which was really fun because i suck so bad at soccer(i think a 4 yr old could beat me) and i got sooo cold and couldnt breathe and had the BEST time. funny how things work like that :) watched day 2 of the X Games, which really makes me want to go snowboarding... alas that i am not Shaun White and cannot do those crazy tricks, much less stay standing. it was so great-- sitting in the car with kelsey while everyone else went and picked out a movie, we were singing along to JOC-Frail, and at one point during the chorus she just held up three fingers and afterwards she looked back at me and said "wow, we were totally in 3 part harmony there". and thats what makes me enjoy singing, even if my voice isnt the greatest-- that sometimes beauty transcends the individual parts to make something so exquisite. i am so happy i get to sleep in tomorrow. last night i was out until 3 again-- stupid of me, i know, but is that so suprising?

      yes. its a lot like that dream. do you want the abstract or the honesty? oh, i can come up with a thousand reasons "why", but i'm guessing that, with you, only honesty will suffice. such a tragedy, because i'm not in an honest mood, and i know that leaves you hanging... which makes the observation that you were hanging there long before i ever came around.  i'm really not sure how i can explain, how i can cover all the bases, but keep myself covered... if thats even possible.  maybe i'm just not ready yet.  give me time. i hate letting you down. i know you're terribly concerned, and just want a way to fix me, or at least something to do so you can say you've tried, and i really am genuinely sorry that i can't give you that security. i hate being innefectual, yet that is the very thing that i am asking you to be-- stop doing. start listening.  give me space.    slipped away to the open and watched the shadows deface the ground

      Words pierce through the air  They make you wear  To get you in a straight jacket label  With your face turned to the wall  This place penetrates when  Everyone that ever tried  To tell you that you're not the same  Watches you fall   You're pushing on the wall on the wall inside  You're pushing outside to find the reasons  You run from this place when they label you   Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)  Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)   You're inside thinking of everyone you ever knew  When they put you outside the separating wall  I can see you standing there waiting for the answer  To the reason no one operates the way you do  Your point of view   You're pushing on the wall on the wall inside  You're pushing outside to find the reasons  You run from this place when they label you   Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)  Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)   Everyday that they can't see  Afraid of what they might find  In the way of what they see  Afraid of what's inside of you   Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)  Reasons to run from this place when they label you (You're pushing on the wall inside)

      there is something utterly enjoyable about taking a long shower. its like brushing your teeth after a weekend of camping with no toothbrush-- totally refreshing and cleansing.   i really didn't want to go to classes today but i just couldnt summon up enough of a headache this morning to warrant staying home... of course, just when i need them most my powers of faking-sick leave me high and dry. gosh.  today in spanish i made the first 100 i have made in that class this entire year. in fact, the first grade above a 90 i have made all year. pretty sad, i know... but if i can make on good real test grade in that range, then i will bring my grade up to a D which is all i really want. as long as i can put it down on my transcript as passing, i'm cool.  i smell like tangerines  .

      have you ever seen The Royal Tenenbaums? well, if you haven't, you should. in fact, i own it on VHS so you should borrow it. i watched that today, and altho it is a totally off the wall movie, it really holds a lot of truth about how people really are. but anyways, since you may not have seen it i won't give away part of the movie by telling you the scene which really hit me today... it would be very unfair. so its just gonna be my little secret. :)  arg. some things in life are just too annoying and frustrating...   lyrics in my head...   with my hands around your throat and i think i hate you. we make the same mistakes, mistakes like friends do    am i too lost to be saved? am i too lost    don't waste your touch you wont find anything worthy of redeeming

      no poetry. i hate that. the interminable wait until it finally comes back.. until i can psychically breathe again.  peace comes at unexpected times.   interview was slightly dissapointing... but i guess i was expecting too much, they are such gorgeous books that i don't think they really can be done as movies adequately... which is a small shame, but it just reinforces the truth that literature will never die because it is essentially  more  than any high technology.   i really enjoy mint cocoa late at night.

      its 2:30 in the morning and i just got back from 6 hours at Dennys drinking coffee.  on the drive back home, i leaned my forehead against the freezing glass of the window, and looked up at the pale stars. audioslave's "lost highway" was playing from the speaker behind my ear  i am not your rolling wheels, i am the highway/ i am not your carpet ride...i am the sky  i just wanted to open the door and jump out. roll down the frost covered grassy shoulder, and out into infinity.   i feel desperately dissapointed, although in what, i'm not sure. its just that little voice in the back of my head screaming THERE IS MORE THAN THIS but is there? i mean... after all these years of searching, shouldn't i have found it by now?  i both hated and loved wednesday night. nothing profound was revealed to me about myself... it only reinforced my unwillingness to change.  yes. i am an addict. yes. i am a sinner and i know it. and yes... i am very comfortable in this slow insanity. i walk a thin line between all consuming need for change-- for realness, and a disgusted understanding that no matter how much i scream, how much you beg, i will never be willing to give up this dysfunction for something pure.   don't you see, don't you see that the charade is over and all the best deception and the clever cover story awards go to you.    if i lick my lips will i taste dead stars?

      i really really like this song.. probly one of my favs of theirs(evanescence) i can definetly relate to it...  Can you forgive me again? I don't know what I said But I didn't mean to hurt you  I heard the words come out I felt that I would die It hurt so much to hurt you  Then you look at me  You're not shouting anymore  You're silently broken  I'd give anything now to kill those words for you  Each time I say something I regret I cry "I don't want to lose you." But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah.  'Cause you were made for me Somehow I'll make you see How happy you make me  I can't live this life Without you by my side I need you to survive  So stay with me You look in my eyes and  I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry .  And you forgive me again You're my one true friend And I never meant to hurt you

      i'm looking towards friday. talking to jamie. pretending to be the same cookie cutter  never a hair out of place. this isn't me! haven't you noticed i've changed? most for the good some for the bad... no escape. please lie to me again let me think-- just for a little while that you're listening it feels so nice to pretend.

      i really hate my arms. as i was washing dishes this evening i looked down at my wrists and just wanted to scream. almost a month and they're still there. but maybe that's good, maybe i need to remember this. had an interesting conversation with Chip today, thanked him for being honest, even though right now it feels like everything is falling apart... usually when things get crazy everyone just starts lying more. i really don't want to go to bed... but i have to. i'm not getting enough sleep lately. its been taking at least 3 caffeinated beverages just to keep me awake until lunch. i really don't want to get addicted again, but i've got to change my habits or else its never gonna stop. i find destructive comfort in keeping you away.

      i'm tired of living my life under guard. afraid to let you in, afraid to be whole again. afraid that if i let you love me, then i'll have to love you back. but this comfortable defeat has lost its appeal... i don't want to be the one always alone. i'm so weak, so utterly frail... if you touch me i might just fall apart. but what release that could be . there's a kind of freedom in pain-- in admitting to feel. i've been lying to myself and pretending to be numb, but i can't deny your touch. solitude always comes with a price, one thats becoming to high to pay. i don't want to push you away but when you get too close instinct kicks in and i can't help myself. i feel like i have no control over myself anymore. everything i know is a lie, everything that makes me,me, is fabrication-- cleverly constructed insanity. all my life i've been putting together this false image of myself, trying to fool everyone into thinking that i'm something worse than myself. look down on me, just don't look into me. but at the same time i rail against invisibility. inside my head i'm screaming for you to notice me, unfortunately the sound never leaves my lips. i want you to read my mind. i want you to run away. i want you to lie and tell me you don't love me. i don't want to deal with this. for so long i've been in this stupid cycle that any other way is inconceivable. i survive by dysfunction... but i am only surviving. there is no life, there is no joy. if i could break down to the essentials, if i could show you my core, my inermost... then i wouldn't be myself. because i am defined by my undefineability. this is my shelter. this is my solitude. this is my destruction. more than anything, i crave true existence. this is my pain-- that i destroy myself in tragic attempts at freedom.

       don't you let me down don't you let me down don't you let me down don't you let me down...   betsy and i went to denny's this evening and hung out with a lot of people that i barely knew. it was weird, all evening i had that feeling like i had either a)woken up after a long night of barely sleeping or b)taken about 12 ibuprofen for no reason. it wasn't exactly pleasant, because i couldn't really focus on anyone or anything, but at the same time, my head was totally devoid of thought.  the questions in youth group today were interesting... probably b/c i have been in that situation with just about all those addictions, either myself or a good friend.  i'm listening to dirty vegas right now and i can't stop my feet from twitching. i really want to get up and dance around, but i have to get going and do some research on ancient Crete(woo hoo.) so love to all, goodnight.

       just 'cuz you feel it doesn't mean its real    interesting conversations always keep me up at night. get to close to truth and i freak out and can't sleep. last night i was up until almost 3, just sitting in our big red armchair thinking.  not sure if i'm going to jaz's party tonight-- i want to, but when i got home from work, bets wasn't here and i have the sneaking suspicion that she may have gone up to wcu to see rick *melodramatic, sarcastic sigh* which would make me very peeved.    small confession, i think i'm starting to lose it i think i'm drifting away from the people i really need   been reading too much and listening to to much FATA... this doesn't bode well. but then, what ever does?  if we do end up going tonight, i hope they have the magnetic words out.

      i want the soundtrack to underworld.  i have a jessica simpson song stuck in my head.  ibuprofen rocks my world.  ...  did you catch the subtle things? the barbed wire words and the summer flings the way she makes you beg and plead for nothing. did you ignore the way you felt? the love and hate and perfection melted down smeared across the tv screen like honey or poison.  ...  my head is so screwed up right now its not even funny. arg. i just want to crawl under a rock and die. you know, back when i lived in south carolina i had this special place down by the pond in our neighborhood. no one else even realy knew it was there except for a few stray dogs.. just me and the water.  i used to go there when really bad things happened, or just when i needed to get away from everyone and everyhting. its funny now that i think about it, because we lived in a really bad neighborhood, and all the drug deals went on at that pond, and there i was this little white girl sitting under some bushes in the mud... like, how innocent i was to not even think i could be hurt, not even realize the danger. now i sort of wish that i could go back there to my spot..  but i understand that i've grown, and i'll never be able to fit back down in there, i'm too big, and also, that i wouldn't really go if i could... now i see the danger, now i realize my fear, andi  can't ignore that. i can't just be who i was then. there is this urgent sense of being caged in my supposed freedom--maybe back then, when i had no real control over what happened to me, no say in how my life went... maybe then i was free. because maybe then i didn't think i could do it all.   i'm going to have to find a new special spot... somewhere that fits the older me. cuz right now i am seriously needing to get away from everyone and everything. yes, even you... although i love you dearly.   i need peace.

      i made cookies today, however they didnt turn out very well so me and betsy have just been eating the dough. i feel sick. but in a good, chocalety-chunky sort of way... like, yah, i'm sick, but it was WORTH it. today has been langourous. long and slowy and hazy... like i'm still not quite awake. maybe its the disruption of my schedule since i'm not going to work, but i guess i'll have to get used to it. do you ever get a song stuck in your head, and its one thats very meaningful but you don't want to hear the message, and then for a day or two its just playing over and over in your head and you can't stop hearing it? i hate that... i don't get like, silly songs stuck in my head for a long time, its always the ones that i don't want to hear, the ones i need to hear. i feel sort of like a cup thats been filled to the very very top, and a breath of air will spill me out all over the place. so i'm just sort of sitting here, hoping one one hand that i will be able to just be still and nothing will happen to upset me or make this big mess, and on the other, hoping that this mighty wind will come and just blow the hell out of me and i'll just spill out all over the place... but that could be sort of exillerating... i mean, then you'd REALLY have to deal with me. i'd really have to deal with myself. oh, but what a frightening thought that really is. i'm looking forward to something... not sure what. but definetly something. its there, right around the corner where i can't see it yet. but its coming. just wait, you'll see. i'm never wrong about these things.  right now i would really like a hug. it feels like a hug moment, unfortunately it is impossible to give oneself a satisfactory hug *sigh*   you understand i'm torn apart.

      And even though the moment passed me by  I still can't turn away   Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose  Got tossed along the way   And letters that you never meant to send  Got lost or thrown away   And now we're grown up orphans  That never knew their names  We don't belong to no one  That's a shame  But you could hide beside me Maybe for a while  And I won't tell no one your name  I won't tell 'em your name   Scars are souvenirs you never lose  The past is never far  Did you lose yourself somewhere out there? Did you get to be a star?  And don't it make you sad to know that life Is more than who we are   We grew up way too fast   And now there's nothing to believe  And reruns all become our history  A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio And I won't tell no one your name   And I won't tell 'em your name   I won't tell em' your name  I won't tell em' your name  I think about you all the time  But I don't feel the same   It's lonely where you are Come back down   And I won't tell 'em your name

      ...  crumpled up attempts of telling you what this is all about are strewn around me here, the letter i wrote to you with the ink smears from the tears i was crying over there, the poems i scribbled on napkins and envelopes-- dropping them conspicuously, in case you saw and picked them up and in my hand, all the shattered intentions, pricking my skin until i bleed.  ...  Writing To ______  maybe you're the only one who really understands and i'm glad i think you're the only one who i could really trust with that. there are things i will never have the strength to tell you and there are things that i will never have to tell you because you already know i don't know how but its true and that is probably the most comforting thing i know. that you know and you're okay with that. i'm always walking the line between selling out to cheaply and hiding myself away balance is always denied and it hurts but i've come to realize that when all other trusts get broken i will still trust you.  ...

      what to say what to say what to say. feeling somewhat disconnected from everyone-- the standard feeling after i get back from being gone for a weekend. would ask you to call, but then, i don't think anyone really reads this, and its not like i'm ever home to receive your call. so its pretty useless.  i haven't really got anything to say on here. maybe later. maybe not. love..

      holdon, folks... this is gonna be a long one. (so if you don't read it all i won't be mad)  i'm not sure that i like this template, but i really felt a need to change from the purple. i'm really starting to envy blog city with their endless variations and formats... but i would feel so fickle changing blogs once again. sort of like i'm afraid of comitment or something. and don't laugh, i know i'm silly-- seeing as this is only an internet journal. but i have scruples,damn it! so. if anyone would like to tell me how i can get a cool format... please do.  there was a little girl in the parking lot at bi-lo throwing snowballs at her dad as he put the groceries in their truck. she was laughing... really laughing. i could hear the peals and screams of giggles from across the parking lot, and even after i stepped inside the swooshing door and into that artificial haven of pleasant temperature and yellow light. i think one of the saddest things about growing up is losing that laugh. you know-- the one you had when you were little and didn't know that it was impolite to laugh when your sister snorted milk out of her nose at the resturant. the one you had when you would still giggle over that same line in  Beauty and the Beast  weeks after you had seen it. i want my laugh back. but wouldn't it be weird if you saw some grown-up(or almost-grown-up) laughing like that? it would be... unnatural. and you would sigh and wish that you could be so uninhibited. but deep down, you'd be sort of repulsed by that... lack of propriety... and as beautiful as the moment was, you'd be scared to repeat it.   you may say i'm a dreamer... but i'm not the only one   we watched Under the Tuscan Sun again today-- or rather, mom watched in and i was in and out on the phone-- a rare thing, i know. but pleasant.  well, tomorrow afternoon we are going down to florence to see mike and amy and the girls, and also to go to steph's ONE VOICE thing. its a really cool christian concert she puts together every year with just local good christian bands playing, and its totally free and awesome. we used to all be the organizers, but since we left she has just taken it and made it even awesomer, and so now we just get to go down and enjoy. plus its a good time to see all my old flo-town friends who i don't keep in touch with. its a little weird, but fun for a night to revist that place and all the memories. everyone there is just waiting to leave, but i like to go back sometimes just to remember how living there affected me and sort of molded me into who i am. i mean, a lot of it was bullshit and totally non-good... but at the same time, i wouldn't even trade in my regrets, because they have become who i am.   and now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names/ we don't belong to no one thats a shame/ a tired song keeps playing on the tired radio/ and i won't tell no one your name... i won't tell 'em your name   i used to just like that song. but after last summer and the ensuing fall, it has really meant more to me-- sort of sums up me in a lot of ways. i guess because of that whole "prodigal son/ orphans vs children" thing... i like to run away because i'm afraid of what it might mean to be accepted. but also because it gives me a picture of jesus, wrapping his arms around me and saying  you could hide beside me/ maybe for awhile  maybe that picture won't mean as much to you as it does to me. maybe it will.  all i know is that in a world where i either feel unnoticed or exposed-- i want someplace to hide, and someone to tell me that, no matter what, they will shelter me and understand me. because as mysterious and unknowable as we like to be, everone needs that one person who can see underneath the masks and tell them the truth no matter what.   i'm waxing...   philosophical? perhaps. melodramatic? a little.  but don't let it get under your skin. he doesn't understand, so don't take it to heart. i know that you'll do fine-- probably better than most. and i know that a lot of times you let them make you believe that you're unworthy or dissapointing or just plain beneath notice. but i know you. you're strong. i see it. because i've seen you fall down and get back up. i've seen you wounded yet surviving. so take it with a grain of salt, love.    and you know i see right through you/ but the world got in your way/ what's the point in all this screaming/ you're not listening anyways

      i don't really have much to say here.  my thoughts are scattering under the weight of a snot-filled head.  so, a little pressure gone, but still so much holding me down.   i can't take my eyes off of you i can't take my eyes off of you i can't take my eyes off of you i can't take my eyes...   and suddenly the world is feeling very ponderous. the sky threatens snow with every shivering breath of wind. what happened to my false spring? we planted flowers. they'll probably all die now.

      well, i'm back in the blogging world. but the guestbook is gone, due to a nasty little trojan incident that shut down our pc for the weekend. so, if you really want to tell me something-- i guess you'll have to email me, or ya know, talk to me in person.  what can i say about Jars? it was exquisite. there and i wish you went tonight as well because they played it again, maybe even a little better, but it wasn't as good without you. and they played tea&sympathy and messed it up a little bit but it was alright because they laughed it off and so did i(me being the only one standing up in that whole friggin auditorium for that particular song...grr) and it was still beautiful. but alas they didn't play one... and so i have to post it here, such a shame.  images on the sidewalk speak of dreams' descent washed away by storms to graves of cynical lament dirty canvases to call my own protest lyrics carved by the old pay phone  and in your picture book i'm trying hard to see turning endless pages of this tragedy sculpting every move you compose a symphony and you plead to everyone see the art in me see the art in me..   and thats only a fragment, so pull out your  Flood  copies(or borrow mine if you don't own it) and listen to that song.... or really, all the songs.  well dolls, shall post later... maybe. i love.

      don't take too much meaning away from this. you'll worry over nothing.   did you get spun out in the swirl?  did you get caught up in the whirlwind of all the let-down stars and all the guys you fucked but didn't mean to 'cuz growing-up was just too hard...  did you get lost like all the rest of the misfit kids trying to make a splash only to find that the glass was half empty all along and you got taken for a ride... did you become another temporary problem with a long drawn-out sollution, like smoke clinging to your skin after a long night of burning bridges that you meant to leave behind but couldn't because you lost all your will-power in some cosmic game of poker when the stakes were too high but you kept playing out of a sense of obligation... did you forget your way back home? did you ask all the right questions to all the wrong people... did you put your faith in their lies and expect to come out on the other side unscathed but instead found yourself right back where you started... spun out in the swirl of too much reality on too little sleep barely clinging to sanity and hoping that this time you'll get through the night but not expecting much of anyone anymore because everyone has always let you down or so you think, when really it was all your bad decisions and all the wrong choices that you made that have inexorably brought you here... no faith. no hope. no will. no home.  just eyes looking back at you through the bathroom mirror so accusing so alone.

      dude. i am sore. but i have lost two pounds just from working out.  yup. beauty is pain(whoever said that should be shot!)  youth group was really good tonight. the worship group spent pretty much all our time working on this one new song which is incredibly beautiful, and it really felt like we were coming together and really blending as a whole instead of just being individual good parts, which is awesome. sarah gave me the phone number of this guy she wants to hook me up with. i'm debating whether to call him or not. i probably will, but i really don't want to go on some blind date-- way too much pressure and expectation. but who knows, i will figure it out.  so excited about JOC.  i really hope i can get to the game on friday night, not only do i wanna see the guys all in drag, but i'd also like to see one of the games.. but its so crazy around here lately, i never know.     i remain, in shadows growing wings

      do you know that there is a quiz on Quizilla titled "How Close To God Are You"? exactly what i needed!!! an online quiz to define my state of spirituality. how fucked up is that...  it took me like, 20 minutes to figure out what kelsey meant "you are bold, but in a naughty way, like shame shame" huh? but once i did, i laughed. do you get it? oh of course you do-- smart people who eat and sleep regularly.  had a weird memory today of a camping trip with betsy and mom a couple of years ago to the beach. we sat the cd player up on the picnic table in the campsite and played Goo Goo Doll's  Dizzy Up the Girl  even my mom liked it. i learned all the lyrics in that one weekend. still love that cd.    you aint ever gonna burn my heart out

      *pause.deep breath*  okay, now i am ready to write a more coherent blog post(me??coherent?? feel free to laugh uncontrollably...)  we watched Shreck tonight. i really love that movie, especially where they make the frog and snake balloons... oh man...*giggles* but one part really hit me, sort of summed up my whole beef with valentines and romance and all that crap...   "you were expecting, what...prince charming? well... yah.   so there you have it, folks. i'm afraid of dissapointment. i'm afraid that i'll get to the altar, or the candelit dinner or the whatever... the "moment" that all chick-flicks tell us we MUST have, and i'll see... what? well, reality. no prince charming. and i'll be left sitting there thinking "hey, you aren't what i ordered, i didn't want this. where's the white horse? where's the shining armor?" because no matter how much i talk about being laid back in relationships or not needing someone perfect or how capable i am... really, i do want all those things. in the deep little dark times that i don't like to think about(they usually fall right between chocolate and fitzgerald)i want a prince charming. or more importantly, i want a Shreck because i am definetly more the night-time version of princess fiona then the day-time one. maybe i'm not so much afraid that prince charming will be dissapointing, but rather that we will come to that "moment"(like in Princess Diaries when she kicks up her foot for the kiss) and mister prince charming will go "who are you and where is the princess i wanted??" ugh. rejection. i mean, who wants a romantic relationship overshadowed by the fear of failure? isn't it much better to just sit back and comment objectively on other people's triumphs and failures? isn't it much nicer to just be on the outside and slightly aloof and never really involved enough to get hurt? well, i like to tell myself that. but its not true. and i really am sorry, dearest darling male readers(if there are any) because i know that was totally estrogen fueled and semi-pathetic("semi"?? um...) but really, bare with me. i am a girl afterall.today has just been a chick flick day. i mean, we came home and watched Under the Tuscan Sun and then Shreck and we are about to pop in Lost in Translation, and what with valentines being only a day past... well, you had it coming.  but, to the good things about this weekend(no more sap!) ~not puking....anymore(i'm sure will agrees) ~Nibbles the Squirrel ~youth group this morning and feeling like maybe they do still remember us up there... you know, those "big church" people ~chris singing Welcome To the Jungle a la Axl Rose ~a song in my head when i woke up  well, i think theres more but i really can't remember right now. and now i really do believe i'm off to... somewhere... if you find me, please tell me where i am, its getting very confusing.  oh, and i totally understand. do you understand that?

      no snow here. just dirty rain out of grey skies slushy streets and swerving cars dogs bark road-noise leaks in the bedroom window. artificial light dulls the senses. grocery trip here alone again with the grey skies and the utterly un-lovely day. chris drives in. dogs follow. mud in driveway churns.   i hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips   that line always makes me laugh. petty people. petty lives. what am i living for again? oh yes.. the hope of something more to come. right. almost forgot about that. almost forgot about you. but you're still here, arent you? be honest, now. yes i think you are.

      i like this quote:  "a girl with brains ought to do something with them besides think"  i find it refreshing.  had an interesting discussion with mom today about Taming Of the Shrew and why there is just that something about it that rubs me the wrong way. at the end of the play i always come away with a bad taste in my mouth. i talked to her about the difference between beating and shaming-- and how when petruchio "tamed" kat, he definetly destroyed something about her, he shamed her and she could never get it back. mom put forward the thought that, while its pretty arogant of one person to play god like he did, if you look at the play as an alegory, she really likes it. but all i could think was-- if thats a picture of god than i sure as hell don't want to know him. i mean, sure, kat was prideful and spiteful and hateful, but she was also free. and to think that god would stoop so low as to take away that freedom just to make me more acceptable and "nice"? no thanks. i mean, i always really identified with the statement in the narnia books that he is "not a tame lion".. and i think, god doesn't want us to be tame. obedient, yes. but not some mindless, conformed robots. not smiling fakes. not at all. and it also made me think about what chip was talking about(was it last sunday?) about how we aren't uncontrollable christians anymore. we are tamed and conformed and bland. its like we've got this misconseption that to be good christians we have to be "nice people", that we can't go against the grain or really stand up for what we believe in. heck, most of us aren't even totally sure what we believe in. i read all these christian books trying to fire people up for a "spiritual revolution" and exhort us to be wilder, bolder christians and i think-- how can we be like that now? i mean, there is no danger here, there is nothing worth dying for. if we were all truly honest with ourselves, i think we would find that comfort is pretty high up on our list of wants. i mean, if we were to go out and really live what we preached, ooooh, that wouldn't be pleasant. i mean, think of all the people we'd have to start loving! think of all the lies we'd have to stop telling! think of all the things we'd have to stop loving less in order to love god more... its just so dirty, so messy, so... uncontrollable. spiritual revolution? spiritual rejuvination? sorry, guys, we are definetly tame christians. trying to dumb down our god and put him in a cage so that he can tamely rule our boring little lives from his unexalted, powerless position. we can pull him out and parade him about when people chalenge us, and then put him neatly away when we're done. but you know, all it would take to really have a "spiritual revolution" to really start actually living for god would be ONE person, just one-- actually doing it. actually going out there and talking less and acting more. living him out day by day....  are you willing to do it? cuz right now i sure am not. way too threatening for me.

      so here is one of the almost-lost poems. don't ask me who its about, because i'm really not sure anymore. i can't remember who i wrote it for or if i wrote it for anyone-- so make up your own mind. asign it to anyone or no one, whichever you prefer.  Not quite mature Almost grown Old enough to be your friend But nothing more. She’s got the wise eyes And little girl smile, And it almost makes her cry To think that She’s a puzzle piece Trying to fit into a square hole Almost making it, But not quite good enough. Maybe when she’s grown She’ll finally understand That all the square pegs Wish they were puzzle pieces Just like her. But right now All she sees is how she  doesn’t quite fit in,  Doesn’t measure up, She’s got high standards But pretends she’s more than she’s not. She sings her song And almost sings in tune Wants to be part of the choir But she was born a solo artist-- Inharmonious But strangely captivating. Not quite mature Almost grown She seems friendly But always ends up alone If she were a story The first word would be Incongruous.

      well, i stayed up until almost 2 last night writing a response essay for my epic literature class. i am fairly pleased with the essay, altho i was so tired this morning that i almost fell asleep in algebra(so not cool). oh yes, did i tell you that i did fall asleep yesterday in dr. clarks debate class? but it was totally his fault! i mean, how can you stick me in a dark, warm room with a lady speaking on video in a horrendously droning voice, and me with no caffeine-- and expect allertness? but then, its dr. clark, so he wasn't really peeved. oh yes, also about yesterday. i went to the teen court hearing thing as one of the jury which was pretty cool, altho i ended up pretty much being the fore"person" b/c the elected one didn't know what to do, which is something i didn't want. but ah well. all in all it was pretty cool, although i think that in the end the Mediation Department is going to be more my style. back to today :) betsy and i went to work out for about an hour this evening which was nice-- good to physically exert myself after the past few months of slowly imprinting the armchair with my buttprint. however, i am already starting to feel sore and i have an appointment with the personal trainer tomorrow afternoon... so if at church i seem a little achey, you know why. i went looking through some of my older poetry last night and found a couple that i had completely forgotten about. most of my poetry i actually revise and then memorize in my head before i put it onto paper(in case i ever lose the hard copy) but somehow these slipped through the cracks, which is deplorable. i may post one or two of them, but its debatable.  looking forward to tomorrow evening, since it seems that anymore church is the only place that i get to see or talk to people-- altho rachel dearest, it was lovely to see you on monday, it totally made my day. oh, and did i tell you that i may be getting a job at the subway in brevard? admittedly not the best job in the world, but it will get me food experience and i really need the money. but i got my W2s from work yesterday and its looking like i may get about a hundred dollar refund check-- always welcome. well, i am going now. goodnight, chickpeas.

      did you watch the grammy's tonight? i was actually pleasantly suprised... i mean, sure, there was the same old political music-industry bullshit, and j/timberlake won another award that he had to apologize for.. but the performances were awesome! so much music-- i'm used to music award shows being all-talk, no-music(which is pretty crappy if you ask me) but the people they picked to collaborate w/ each other i thought was really good. i spent the afternoon with kelly, robbie, becky, and sarah. first cleaning sarah's room to move in a bed for heathyr(YAY) and then at the mall. it was really fun to hang out with them, altho mom did get a little mad cuz i kept changing plans around and such(how inconsiderate of me) but as usual, i got off with light punishment. fun music news: John Mayer and Guster are coming to charlotte may 10th... ooh, i hope i have ticket money! since its looking like once again, i won't make it to AFI(g.d.s.a.f!). i am going to serve on the teencourt jury tomorrow right after i get out of class-- which means that i actually have to dress nice and wear make-up on a monday..arg. i am so not prepared for tomorrow. why can't it snow again???

      well, the teen court volunteer thing i went to today was pretty interesting. i mean, its a totally cool concept(a juvie court with teen jurors and attorneys) but most of the other kids there were either younger than me or just really immature. however, the ladies who came from Buncombe Mediation gave me their cards and said i might fit in better doing teen mediation cases with them... so i guess i'll call them in a few days and see how it works. mom had to go to a meeting for training up new homeschool testers, and since maddie's mom was also there, me and her hung out at Essence all afternoon. it was really nice to be able to just sit down and talk with her. its very refreshing to have an entire conversation where you're not thinking about what the other person is thinking about you, which is something i find myself doing a lot. i almost wish i had gone to the dance last night, since it seems like everyone had fun, or at least there were funny moments... but i understand that there wasn't really a way i could have, so i'm not really bummed about it or anything. i also saw laura at the coffee shop today, although daniel was also there and so(not suprisingly) she mainly just goofed off with him... i guess i should just learn that thats how "couples" are, or at least some of them. it just annoys me a little bit, i guess... i never want to be so completely involved in someone else that i can't pay attention to the rest of the world. but ah well. i went to Troop's eagle scout court thing tonight, which was really nice... i always think that boyscouts are the sort of guys you want to marry. not necessarily date(they're a might bit too wholesome) but just lookikng at all their squeaky-clean faces i thought-- wow, i can totally see all of them in 10 years with minivans and white picket fences and smiling families.  i really wanted there to be a girls night tonight, but i guess it couldnt get worked out and thats okay. i mean, its cool... its not like i'll die from sitting at home another night, its what i do anyways. well, i suppose i'll go... do... something. i don't know what. perhaps twiddle my thumbs. perhaps make arts-and-crafts. who knows! dear god, save me from the arts and crafts.  "lovely, just  lovely "

      Bleed Black Lyrics  I am exploring the inside. I find it desolate. I do implore these confines now as they penetrate, "recreate me." I'm hovering through out time. I crumble in these days. I crumble, cannot, I cannot find reflection in these days.  If you listen, (listen, listen) listen close,  beat-by-beat, you can hear when a heart stops. I saved the pieces when it broke and ground them all to dust.  I am destroyed by the inside.  I disassociate.  I hope to destroy the ouside. It will alleviate and elevate me. Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days. As morphine tears through deadened veins I'm numbing in these days.   If you listen, (listen, listen) listen close,  beat-by-beat, you can hear when a heart stops. I saved the pieces when it broke and ground them all to dust.   I know what died that night.  It can never be brought back to life once again,I know.  I know what died that night. It can never be brought back to life once again,I know.  I know I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life. Once again, I know. I know I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life. Once again, I know.  If you listen, (listen, listen) listen close,  beat-by-beat, you can hear when a heart stops. I saved the pieces when it broke and ground them all to dust. If you listen, (listen, listen) listen close,  beat-by-beat, you can hear when a heart stops. I saved the pieces when it broke and ground them all to dust

      another bad night. oh, but we don't talk about those, sorry so please just strike that statement from the record.  finished my book-- it had a totally creepy and not-quite satisfying ending, you know, the kind that stick with you for awhile after you've finished the last word on that last page.  i have some volunteer thing to go do tomorrow, but afterwards, if anyone wants, we should do something. in fact, i will be in asheville when my volunteer thing gets done, so talk to me tonight or something...   wondering if [she's] more than arguments and failed attempts to fly

      i got my prom dress today. oh darlings, its absolutely perfect and only 50 bucks!  score.  i also baked super awesome cookies tonight(chocolate chocolate chip with pecans and oatmeal.. mmmm) and watched The Pianist which is a gorgeous movie. i even laughed in it, although i'm not sure that i was supposed to damn macabre sense of humor!  all in all it was a pleasant day even the dentists wasn't so bad. i'm still praying for snow on sunday night heaven forbid that i should actually have to go back to school and all the work entailed! i really think that school should just end now. i mean, honestly i've learned a lot(i think) isn't that enough?  also watched Pitch Black this evening, which is one of my favorite action movies(will, if you're reading this, its on "the list" which i am making). i totally can't wait until Reddick comes out sometime this summer. deeelish.  did you know chris listens to hardcore emo?  yup. he's got Brand New's first cd, which i covet horribly. so silly-- after all those years when all he would listen to was Hardcore and old school Punk. how we do change.  i really hope i end up going to Becky's this weekend.    song of the moment stuck in my head:   spinnin' out of control, out of control.  spinnin' out of control, out of control!  'cuz i don't know if i can trust you  and i don't understand what you want from me...  ~hoobastank.

      i hate rituals. i believe there is a fine line between ritual and tradition, but a very important line. tradition is something that you do every time, because every time, it fills you with joy and fills everyone around you with that, and it reminds you of all the past joys and makes you look forward to the future joys.  ritual is stale. its that thing you do just because you've always done it and maybe you're just too boring to stop. and its lost all its color and meaning to everyone, but you're just too safe to change anything, and so it continues. i think my life is steadily becoming a series of rituals.  have you ever noticed how certain people are just innately attracted to drama(and by this i don't mean stage acting, but life drama)? its like, they are only ever around when something "big" is happening, and its a totally subconcious thing. i know a lot of people like that. and sometimes it makes me so mad because, when i really needed them-- in between the dramas, the breakdowns, the whatevers, when i was sort of gasping for air, or just trying to live-- thats when they weren't there. and after the fact, when they come around and sincerely want to help i just want to scream "where were you?! its too late for you to do anything now except suck all the life out of me" because i really do think they feed of drama. if life is boring, then they don't stick around, or they create their own fantastical problems to center their attention on. i really hate being one of those people.  i've been reading a terribly interesting book called  The Witching Hour  by Anne Rice. its not one of her vampire books, and i think i like it even a little better than those-- i guess because it deals with more sympathetic characters, people i can really sink my teeth into. i've been doing pretty much nothing but reading for the past couple days, it being a fairly thick book, and its a little disturbing. not because i'm reading so much, for when i'm in a good book i tend to read to the exclusion of everything else until its finished, but more because when i put the book down, i find myself still thinking in the same thought patterns as the characters. i'm not thinking about the story, but i'm viewing my own life through a lense of their morals and ideals. now the kicker-- this story is about crazy people. however, it really is fascinating because it just totally messes around with my view of myself and of life and gives some pretty cool insights. and i think that is what good books are really supposed to do-- get us into the minds of the character(and through that into the mind of the author) and make us reevaluate ourselves and our surroundings, not so that we would change completely over to their point of view, more so that we can more acurately define our own. okay, so bear with me, because its like one thirty in the morning and i really know i should be in bed.  i guess right now i just want someone somewhere to give me some sort of affirmation(was that vague enough for you?) "no, emma, you're not crazy" i'm not asking you to make it believable, just say the appropriate things. my self-image isnt so tied up in what other people think of me that i actually believe what they tell me. on the contrary, i have a very well defined self-image, something i think few people have, and my only use for other peoples opinions on me is that it lets me gauge how good a liar i am. yes, think on that one.  i have a dentists apointment tomorrow, and also an apointment with a personal trainer. didn't your mother tell you that cleanliness was next to godliness? ...wait, that was a smashing pumpkins song.  my bad.

      oh, you know what my favorite memory from sunday is? riding back to church after the party in the backseat of ashely's car. i'm singing along to Switchfoot on the radio, with a semi-hoarse voice and in the middle of the song i get this unexpected self-concious thought that maybe i should just shut up b/c it really can't be sounding too good. so i do (stupid, i know) and then, meagan turns to me, holding her cell phone and she says "i was trying to record you singing so i could send it to Jamie. you know, he loves your voice when you sing. but you stopped" and i think maybe it wasn't my best singing ever. maybe it doesn't matter.   but dearest, i won't tell you what the worst moment was. i think thats for another time, eh?

      i was listening to A Perfect Circle's first CD  Mer De Noms  last night, which i just recently got. I had heard most of the songs on the album before, but never really gotten a chance to sit down and listen to it all the way through. One of the songs on there--"Judith" really hit me last night, because its about this girl(judith, i'm guessing) who is a christian and the whole song is talking about how wrong she is and how god doesnt really love her or he's not really there. its a really powerful song and hit me pretty hard-- i guess b/c it addressed some of the excuses i like to make for why i don't trust god or don't even really believe in him sometimes(or at least try to make myself think i dont). but at the same time, the song is contrasting all these supposed ways that god is not good, against this girls total faith. i mean, here she is, with an  entire freaking song written to her on why she's wrong, and she still won't change. thrown in her face is the fact that  It's not like you killed someone/It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side/Praise the one who left you/Broken down and paralyzed . the chorus of the song is, i think, what hits me the most. over and over he sings  He did it all for you , trying to make it into a sarcastic cut against "blind faith" and "false belief". but you know what i came away with after listening to that song? simple.  ...he did it all for me.  and i don't think you can take that away because its real. and no matter how much i hate god sometimes, how much i scream and try to run from him, the simple fact remains.  he did it all for you... he did it all for you... . and that is hope.

      well, i called the lady at the Mediation center today to see about volunteering. i'm setting up a meeting with her and the other lady who works in the youth department to sit down and actually plot out what i will be working on and who i will working with, its pretty cool.  i also tried on my prom dress today, and blessedly it fit-- with a little work on both me and mom's parts. but hey, beauty is pain, right? and its not really painful either.   tomorrow is going to be interesting... bets and i get up in the morning and pack and then leave at 10:45 with mom to sit through the english class she teaches at north asheville baptist, and then we go over to the lutzes and sit around while she watches beth test some kids, and then back to the church to hook up with chip and kelsey and over to the cabin for the retreat. ah yes, the retreat. and what shall i say on that preciouses?  hm.  shall i say anything at all? i think i shant.  and i'm getting really excited about Jamie coming up for spring break-- i've missed him a lot, and also i think we are going to have a lot of fun, even if its not the beach.   i cheated this evening and put a tiny bit of butter on my mixed vegetables.  i bow down to the diet deities and ask humble forgiveness.  which also makes me think to say that if you are not yet going to the dance in april, you sure as heck should go or there shall be firery wrath raining down upon your neglectful heads afterwards. thus sayeth the me.   and i'm out b/c i think the low fat spices on my skinless boneless chicken have gone to my head in awful ways.

      good morning, gentle readers.  i hate diets. i have decided that after this one finishes in a week and a half, i am going to say "SCREW IT!" and just become horrendously obese. sound good to you?  so we got a second line installed for the business, which is also forwarding all the business calls over from the colemans. everything is still absolutely chaotic around here, but there is hope for order, and things are starting to look, if not better, at least manageable.  an apple and some cheese cubes is not what i call lunch. darn models.   tell you i'm sorry you don't know how lovely you are

      she's not a car wreck, you know. so please don't slow down and hang out your window. don't crowd that room until its suffocating and the doctor says it hinders healing. don't just come if you want to reassure yourself that you must be a good person, because obviously only people who have sinned big get bad diseases. don't bring your children. don't walk out afterwards telling them not to smoke (because isn't that how all cancer is caused anyways??) don't bring your self-help books or your miracle diets. don't cling and grasp and suck and need. don't just come because thats what good people do-- don't make this your charity.   sometimes, i really hate people.  ...  i got a thing in the mail today-- an aplication to this global leadership program. 13 days spread between Prague, Budapest, and Vienna... only 5,000 dollars. donations anyone?  and i'm trying to learn to see my blessings, trying to accept things with more grace and brush more things off my shoulder. trying to notice the details instead of being stuck on the big issue. trying to grow up.  don't burst the bubble.

      i just need this to be alright i can't feel this another night i can't take this;i come unglued i might break down in front of you...  ...  there has been too much of this week. at random points during my days i had to fight to keep from just sitting down in some corner and crying-- not over anything in particular, but because there was nothing else to do. i wish we didn't live on such a busy road now. i used to take walks late at night, just to clear my head and find perspective, but now all i've got is a bunk bed and a cd player-- and that just doesn't quite match up to a sky full of stars and cold toes in dewey grass.  the creed exercise this morning wasn't encouraging for me. it should have been. and i did write down a lovely paragraph or two of exactly what i "should" be feeling-- the struggles that as a fairly normal christian teenager i should be going through and the ideas i should be holding onto. but if i were to be really, deeply honest with that exercise, my paper merely would have said    do i believe?   ...  could it be that i don't want to save you anymore? could it be that i don't have what it takes?

      okay. so its been a little while since i posted. a lot of stuff has happened but nothing really important, or at least that i want to talk about right now. what i want right now is a nap. but my mommy says i must stay awake for awhile longer so that i won't wake up in the middle of the night or some crap... like i couldn't sleep fifteen hours straight! oh yea of little faith. this weekend has been both tiring and relaxing, but very fun. it was nice to just go and hang out with mi compadres, altho this afternoon i totally crashed, which made me a little mad cuz i wanted to go to ashely's and hang out but i am just too tired to get real clothes on(yup, already in my pjs) and go. okay, so nothing much else to talk about.  oh wait! yes. if you think about it, next wednesday please be praying for Ms. Wendy b/c she is going in to have major surgery and it is also my mom's birthday. so try to keep her in your thoughts and the doctors as well.

      greetings gentle blog-readers.    heh.    so i missed the youth leadership meeting tonight which i didn't like, but then i didn't get home until like 7 and it was a good night to stay at home and create order. but i shall try to be at the other ones if i can!  today was a stepping-back day. lots of stories told, but very few mine and i liked it that way. it was a day to listen and laugh a little inside my head, but also bend my mind around understanding and perspective. i think perspective is a horrible thing to lose(funny from a girl who doesn't have any to lose in the firstplace!)  i got the pictures copied today and they all were wonderful. i think she will enjoy them emmensly.  sometimes i feel like such a growned-up... isn't that silly?  terribly silly.      hell if i know.

       Run your mouth when I'm not around It's easy to achieve You cry to weak friends that sympathize Can you hear the violins playing you song? Those same friends tell me your every word    ...and if you know where those lyrics came from, then i'm sorry, and i'd just like to say that i don't even like the whole song, just that little part. so don't make fun o' me! :D

       and if you ever said you'd miss me than don't say you never lied    soaking up Queen Of The Damned. read half the book in 3 hours. really interesting... the more i read the more i like her style of writing. its very intimate, but in a genuine way, something that not many authors can do, but when they can its beautiful.  i am addicted to american idol *shoot me, oh god... just shoot me!*

      so hopefully this time i'm back for good-- unless we find another darned problem with this peice of junk pc! this weekend was wonderful. the concert was pretty good-- 2 out of the 3 bands were good, and 1 of those 2 was AWESOME(sort of like a christian rage agains the machine) at the concert i got to hang out with some of my old friends, but most especially my best friend from 8th grade year who i haven't seen since. she's still really cool(maybe even a little cooler--but aren't we all since 8th?) however, it was a little shocking to see her really goth/punk when before she was very sweet and innocent looking. but then, i think the goth fits her personality better anyways. church sunday was good although there were a more people there than usual(or did it just seem that way?) and i think a lot of them really missed the point of it which made me sad. oh, and one word about youth leadership which i think at least 3 people have already mentioned: C-O-N-V-I-C-T-I-O-N  got to hang out sunday afternoon with becky and sarah and laura. very relaxing even tho the movie wasn't that good and the walk around fletcher park was pointless. but isn't that what sunday afternoons are for?  okay, i have my mommy's credit card and i must go register for the SAT what joy is mine.  i love you all

      hmm... i think i shall put this one up on all three.(three? you query-- but the last one is all and only mine-- to say the things i cannot say to you, yet)    Dangerous Open Boxes   what's the point  in all this posturing? I know you see  right through all my lies. but still I pretend--  that if I hide away  and put on all my masks-- you'll let me slide covered up in secrets wrapped inside deceit you peel away the layers to find the raw  and untamed me.

      wow... its been a little while since i posted on here. i guess thats what i get for not getting on the computer. so next monday is our official last day of school, altho its really just going to be one large party. i took my algebra final yesterday, and i have absolutely no idea how i did on it-- but i'm guessing not too stellar. since finishing LOTR, i've sort of run out of reading material, i guess its time for me to find some money and buy more books. of course, i could go back and reread some of my older books/series,but after the 5th or 6th time, i know the story so well that i can practically recite it in my head, without having to look at the words.  sunday i went and saw the Punisher. DON'T go see it. it made me so mad and depressed in the end. i hate when movies make the supposed good guy into someone you hate. i mean, in the end he's giving his little "wherever there is evil and injustice, i will be there" speech, and it was so stupid because all through the movie he had been doing these really mean vindictive things-- and now he thought he could go be a superhero? i'm sorry, just because you're fighting against the "bad guys" does not make you a good guy.  whatever happened to integrity?  anyways, i'm gone.

      i finished LOTR today. i feel like i have accomplished something with that... i mean, that was the first time  reading it on my own . i mean, sure i've heard it must be 20 times read outloud(with individual character voices) since i was age 4, but there is something much different about reading it myself... altho in my head i still pretend that its my dad doing the voices, except they don't sound quite as good just in my head.  this afternoon i went with emily over to her house to do laundry, and then since chris is at work until 10:30 we went and at celito lindos in brevard for a rediculously low price... i love mexican restaurants(i don't think thats spelled right but i never have been able to spell that damn word anyways). she's very cool, and a lot like me, which i didn't expect when i first met her. funny how that is with people... they keep suprising you.  i miss my clothes.

      i painted a picture yesterday its not what i wanted to paint but i still like it sort of like an ugly baby...  my nose is running like a faucet which is quite suprising and unpleasant, seeing as never before have i had alergies and suddenly *boom* here they are and using tissue is like trying to stop a flood with a 2x4.  today we went up onto the parkway and did the short trail up to devil's courthouse. it was amazing the sky was clear and i could see for miles... absolutely wonderful.  and then we went over to the pisgah inn for a late lunch which was tasty and expensive as always, but thouroughly enjoyable.   i told him about... the trees that fell in the street the dust that caked our bare feet the teachers that took away my pride the parents who made me want to die the nights i spent out in the rain screaming, "god, i'm going insane!"  i told him about my hometown ...the place where we all fall down

      wow. what a weird week. too much to talk about all that now. so instead, we skip ahead to the weekend. the florence weekend. easter weekend.  you should have seen me, you skeptics. i wore a knee length white skirt, and white high heels and a bright colored striped top.  i looked ready for some flippin garden party. bleck!  but at least the church service was better than expected. not good, mind you, but at least entertaining.  there were two interpretive dances, one which was alright. the childrens choir sang "adorably" off key. an "average joe" randomly strolled up to the pulpit and started asking the pastor "hard questions" about christianity, only to be led(totally unscripted, now!) to christ. and if you believe that i have a bridge to sell you! the audience thought it was wonderful.  but you know, as cynical of it as i am, they really are sweet people. good people. loving people. and i know that sometimes they do want to jump out of their seats and live radically for god... they just can't find their ways out of the country club. and i think i really shouldnt be so snotty about it all, its not like i'm miss perfect never sins or is hypocritical christian... not a chance. my sins aren't better.  it just bugged me during the "dialogue" with the "unsaved joe" how they never touched on the real questions. it was just a more interesting way for the pastor to give his regular easter sermon. and during one of his little speals, i almost jumped out of my seat and started asking my own questions. "so you say he's changed your life... how?" "and are you sure that you've done enough good deeds to get into heaven?" "have you ever looked out upon this sea of complacent faces and wished for passion?" "do you ever get tired of your faith that only fills boxes and your grace that never breaks down all the walls?"  but instead i sat on my hands. because they really are nice people. and no matter how big of a scene i made, they wouldnt get it. because not only are they comfortable right where they are, they can't comprehend anything different.  i'm comfortable, too. but at least i know that there is something more, if i was only willing to go for it, to give up this for that. so does that make me better than them? no. worse.  because i know and still i resist... at least they don't know whats really out there for them, the freedom they can have. they are blind. i see the chains around me and yet i am still.

      have you ever been down to rosetta's kitchen late at night? i love the air, there. really warm and smells of herbs and things cooking. and all the people seem so surreal--like maybe they just came into existence when you walked in the door, with their odd hair and fascinating conversations already half-completed. a guy at the table over from us shared his fries .  its hard to be on both sides of a wall. i have to side with him, my gut rebels against anything else, but my heart reaches out and bleeds for her because i know. i know the pain of being off inside but not quite realizing the need for change yet as the world slowly falls apart around you, and some of its your fault, but the one driving need is to feel... right.    so tear me open pour me out there's things inside that scream and shout... ...and the dirt still stains me so wash me until i'm clean

       sunrise like a nosebleed your head hurts and you can't breathe you've been trying to throw your arms around the world    less than a half a day until the dance. the scene keeps popping into my mind from Ever After when she walks up that little platform and is looking out across the sea of somewhat unfriendly faces "just breathe"  she whispers.  or trinity, laying at the bottom of the stairs holding two guns trying to talk herself into moving.  or medea on the brink of insanity debating with herself whether it is better to kill her children herself, or let them be taken by her enemies and forever lose her chance for revenge.  i think medea loves her children strongly. there is no weakness in her decision. and i don't know that i could handle love that strong, that absolutely immovable. i wish for a weak love, a love that doesn't always do what's right or necessary, a love that often loses, and very rarely wins.  for two reasons. one) because you can run away from a weak love and two) because you won't want to run away.  i think i did about the most horrible job of communicating that ever. sorry.   have you heard the new switchfoot song? i think i'll post some of it up here. its lovely. i love it.

      alright, i have two quotes that i think are really cool to post up here tonight, the first is from St.Augustine and the second is from a Morrisey song:   "Every man who walks into a brothel is looking for God whether he knows it or not"    "You'll never know the sun until you've seen dawn rise behind a school for the blind"   ...yah, well i think their cool.  tonight mom and i went shopping so that i could get a bathingsuit before we go to NCHE and then to LA-- since there will be swimming oportunities at both and i really couldn't wear the mismatched peices from several different suits that i have been making due with since the weather got nice. the only problem with mom and i going shopping is that we tend to buy way more stuff then we walked in wanting to get, and so we came out loaded with bags when we had went in for just 2 things-- but i'm not really complaining :)  NCHE is going to be such a hassle this year. I am not getting there until early Friday afternoon, but even so i will be working all of friday and saturday with maybe one or two breaks-- which is a lot different from the last few times when i have gone and just hung out with people or wandered around the conference. however, mom is paying betsy and i both $30 dollars a day to work, and i really do need the money.

      so, the yardsale is tomorrow and i am definetly helping... i don't want to, you know, but i feel obligated, and i am desperately trying to tell myself "you will have fun, and if you don't go then you will be angry at yourself afterwards" which is usually the case with these things.  i got a phonecall from eric today, he is NOT in bootcamp, but in texas with his Dad. i felt guiltily relieved. aparently his recruiter screwed up some paperwork stuff and so he wasn't able to go to boot, and so now he will be coming back here in a few weeks and trying to get into the Marines, who hopefully won't screw him over like the Army did. i am so happy. i mean, i know that he is really upset about not being able to go--it was something he really wanted-- and i know that he will just end up leaving again as soon as he can get it worked out with the marines, but i am selfish. and i am glad he is not gone.  Jasmine's going away party is on June 6th. I am helping her plan it altho perversely, i will not be going.  i don't want to go to LA this year. i really don't want to have to deal with that world-- the reality they create-- but i know that its the only time i will be able to see dad, and i am his daughter afterall.

       deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't want to see covering it up like a cut with the likes of me even though i try i just can't get my head around you   all of yesterday there was no power and subsequently no water at my house.  it was probably the laziest day i have had all year and thats saying something. i sat by the window all day and read, and then when it was too dark to see the small print i took sharpies and wrote on my shoes. the power company keep pushing the time back of when we would get our power back on until finally they said it wouldn't be until 10:30 pm. so we went to Cielito Lindos and listened to the mariachi band and ate fried icecream, and then checked into a hotel for the night. bets and i went out to denny's and talked to people there, including eric who is leaving in 4 days for the Army. that makes me sad. i'm going to miss him... he's sort of being a staple in my life since i first moved up here and now he's not going to be around. i think i'm going to cook him dinner sunday. i didn't really sleep last night for a number of reasons and i'm expecting that tonight will be pretty much the same since i'm sleeping over at the rayl's.  i really should sleep more. oh well. do you ever get the feeling that you've missed out on something big for your entire life and you've just now finally gotten it but its too late? yah... thats sort of me. i think back on my past and i wonder how different i would be if certain things hadn't happened, and what sort of person i would be like... its hard to recognize that even the things that i regret every moment of my life, and the things that make me cry at night, put me where i am now. i want them to go away, want them never to have happened, but i understand that if they hadn't, then maybe i wouldn't be here and i wouldn't know you and i would not have the same outlook on life as i do now. i wonder if that would be better or worse.  its sort of pointless, i know, because i really can't go back and change things, but i guess it helps me a little to realize that everything has some sort of value in it-- even the worst things, because those hurts just made me stronger, and made me able to cope with lesser things later on. god blesses us in the most unexpected ways.

      that was the sort of weekend to make one hate weekends.  but isn't i funny how the things you think that you absolutely can't handle are exactly what you need the most?  the songs were like bullets to the chest-- blowing through all the walls i had already started building up around the situation to keep from collapsing. but sometimes its okay to be shattered, and standing in that stairwell undone, i found unexpected grace, and i am beginning to think that, for me, grace will always be unexpected.  then sitting in that uncomfortable folding chair looking around the table at faces i hardly new and trying to talk about god's love. suddenly overwhelmed by the knowledge that i am  so  small and that he is so big.  but it still hurts.

       rain rain on my face hasn't stopped raining for days   so. the SATs are over. i was suprised at how quickly i got through each test, i usually had about 10 minutes to sleep before the clock stopped. i don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but i really don't care. i know what i know, i don't know what i don't, and no amount of calculater banging or hair pulling or pencil breaking will change that.  really really messed up inside about a lot of things. i hate this feeling. why can't the world just leave me alone? i bet its asking the same question about me...

      wow,what a feeling. i wore real clothing for the first time in over a week... it was really strange. especially since, altho i am no longer contagious and therefore allowed out of the house, i look as if i have really really bad acne i was very self-concious. i noticed that i was not looking people in the eye as much, trying to cover my face with my hair, even walking more self-conciously, and it really made me realize how much i care about my appearance. i mean, what should i care if the people in the mexican resturaunt think i have bad skin? why should it matter? but it does. and its not even like i really look like this all the time. so depending on how i feel i may come to the concert at church tomorrow, i'm still not sure about that though. i mean, i want to come, but just going out to eat this evening made me really tired and i'm wondering how being around a bunch of people i actually know and am excited about seeing will make me feel physically. its also been pretty strange around my house, because everyone is very stressed out, but since i'm sick i've been sort of the observer and not really in the middle of things. i've been able to sit back and watch everyone else which is definetly new for me and also a little uncomfortable... because i felt so disconnected from everyone.  they were all so careful around me and concientious which is definetly NOT how they usually act. i mean, i love my family but we are all pretty intense about our own things and not really other peoples. but anyways... this is just to say i'm still alive and i hope i will get to see you before i leave...again... next tuesday.

      chickenpox. yup. at 15 years old. and i don't even know how i got them. did you know that you can get chickenpox on your earlobe? and in your armpits? and up your nose and in your mouth and on your scalp? i didn't until yesterday. it almost looks like i just have horrible acne... except that anyone who had acne this bad would probably commit suicide out of self-loathing. and i am having the strangest fantasies about scraping all my skin off or lighting myself on fire... because it only hurts for a little bit and then i would be blissfully dead and no longer so horrificly... itchy. is it wrong to want to burn your own skin off? and of course the worst of it is that this is not a bad enough case that mom will take me to a doctor and get some tranquilizers so i can just be nocked out for a week or so, so i have to just suffer through this until it decides to leave. but enough of my bitching... i'm sure all of you have had chickenpox, and you all obviously survived and are not permanently damaged... altho chickenpox did drive our chicken's crazy when they got it-- thats what happens to chickens. so i suppose i should be thankful that i am not a chicken because i am only itchy instead of absolutely insane.

      its always weird coming home and realizing that the world didn't stop just because i was away. everyone's lives moved on while i was in a different state, and i just missed peices of it. which sucks.  once again my entire world has become one huge chaotic mess-- we are going too many places in too short of time but thats how it goes. my room is a mess(more than usual) and i'm living out of a suitcase practically. sometimes i wish for normalcy... but later i am always glad that wishes don't really come true. i like my life i do. sometimes it just wears me out.

      ah, and i have to tell you this!  driving through bev. hills, i was commenting to Lee that people here were so much different then they are over in NC. she was interested and asked me, "how are they different? in what ways?" i didn't exactly know how to explain it to her, until i looked out the driver side window and started laughing, because i had found the perfect example-- the man in the passenger seat of the car next to us was plucking his eyebrows as the traffic sped along. it was probably one of the most absurd things i have seen in my entire life, and absolutely not something you would find in asheville. we all of course, were laughing uproriously-- and the man next to us with the perfectly groomed eyebrows was completely oblivous.  i just thought you might enjoy that.

      okay. so i have been wondering lately if our youth group has any other hobbies besides ultimate, soccer, swing dance, and coffee. i mean, honestly. i'm feeling a little left out because i can't play soccer, i'm afraid of frisbees, and i have no rhythm... i can drink coffee and thats about it. and it seems like at church, at least on wednesdays, thats about all we talk about, and about all we plan to do... except for the occasional movie. so i'm sort of glad that wednesday night church is ending. perhaps i am just getting bored-- need a change, and maybe once the summer is over i will be able to appreciate things more. i don't know. i just wish that i didn't feel like if i am not a part of certain things, or like to do certain things, than there is no place for me. not to say that anyone shuts me out or is not interested in me... but we don't ever have anything to talk about. i smile, say "whats up?" and "oh, yah, i'm doing fine" and then we smile at each other and move on to different conversations with people more compatable.  i like you. i think you're positively wonderful. but i tend to wonder if we will ever be anything more than casual aquaintances... if we will ever turn into friends. because i've known you for a while now, and i'm still hopelessly baffled as to how to go about getting to know you. i can't take up certain of your hobbies. do you have any others? i mean...   honestly.

      his name was Tennessee. he had aids, severe schitzophrenia and an alcohol problem. Sarah talked to him the most because she has the heart that I lack in many ways. i wanted to weep. if anyone had laughed i think i would have.  I probably should have learned some lesson from him. maybe i did. but unfortunately i don't know what it was... but i will remember Tennessee. and Rosco.

      okay, so this is just something that i came across last week and thought was pretty cool. you may think its sort of cheesy or whatever, but i really like it and i hope that you at least find it interesting, whatever you final judgement on it is :)   "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you NOT to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. As we let our own light shine, we unconciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.   so yah, i thought that was really cool and wanted to share. much love.

      weird. i was just reading through some of my blog posts from 2 years ago on my old blog. its really strange because i remember the things i was writing about on there but they were a lot different than what i made them out to be in my posts. i sounded so happy-- so spastic. i think that its really easy to see how other people change and i sort of get the idea that i have always been a certain way until i look back and realize that i've changed a lot too. and its not bad necessarily, its just shocking because when i look back its almost as if i'm looking at a totally different person, because i can't remember feeling or thinking that way.  well, i put in my application at L&amp;L Bagel and i am going in monday to interview with the owner. I really do hope i get a job there even tho everyone else who works there is absolutely crazy. at least i will have some food experience so i can work in nicer restaraunts later on.

        you might just be what i need,      no...i would not change a thing        so, warped tour was the best it has ever been-- even though i did get kicked in the head and almost pass out. i was in the front row for both Bouncing Souls and From Autumn To Ashes and got to shake the lead singers' hands which was really really cool. on top of everything the weather was great-- cloudy and almost raining-- and so i didn't get too badly sunburned. I took no pictures, bought nothing, and walked away with only a button and an autographed poster(very cool of the band to give it to me for free) and i am sublimely happy. there is something magical about being squashed between sweaty people for 8 straight hours that just makes you feel content. my oldest neice, Lilli, who is almost 4 is staying with us until Friday b/c her mom's grandpa died and Amy had to go up to tennessee for the funeral. it is always really fun to have Lilli with us even tho I am still exhausted from yesterday.    and if a peice of you dies,      Autumn I will bring you back to life     I see you... I do.

      climb up on that cross and crucify yourself its just another day and you're just another modern messiah  try to save them all catch those broken angels when they fall open up your arms and collapse under the weight of all the promises you couldn't keep  don't let yourself realize that this freedom you claim is just another modified cage where all the liars come to laugh at their domesticated modern messiah  the little girl crying in the corner 'cuz she couldn't save the world.

      "Your Wall"    You've got a way Of watching the world divide  You into place Direction is lost in flight  Everyone is gone Let it slip away Look at you At the end of it  This moment arrives  And it takes you further inside In through your wall again That covers you once you're in In through your wall again Until you can reach the end  I can see through When communication is gone The pieces of you Fall down from the cloud you were on   Now everyone is gone  Let it slip away Look at you now you're at the end  This moment arrives And it takes you further inside Into your wall again That covers you once you're in In through your wall again Until you can reach the end In through your wall  Empty your head and the rest will come I missed you then the moment was gone Look at you now  This moment arises And it takes you further inside Lost your place but no one can tell That  you're sick of losing yourself   This moment arrives And it takes you further inside Into your wall again That covers you once you're in In through your wall again Until you can reach the end In through your wall ~Revis

      It was Sunday morning in Battery Park we sang hallelujahs that caught spark The breeze blew across my face and up to you And for a moment we were true.  But the singing stopped and the voices stilled Sunburn erasing the memories we killed 'til only the scars remain-- Joy, and the beautiful communion of pain I dreamed last night that we stayed the same but it wasn't enough.

      I don't want to be the match that starts the fire I don't want to be the stream that creates the canyon I don't want to be a break or a division or a turning point I don't want my actions to matter.  I don't want to be a leader I don't want to have to leave I don't want to break your hearts Or leave you hurt and angry I don't want this pressure on me.  Let me be invisible again Let me hide in the shadows and not have an affect Let me be lonely and alone Because at least then it wouldn't matter If I go.

      we paint the world in blue and black-- midnight skies and old cadillacs dark secrets we're forced to keep swollen eyes that cannot sleep. we paint the town in red and grey-- concrete walls that hide the day lipstick poems on bathroom stalls forgotten ghosts run down the halls. we paint our thoughts in white and brown-- dreams, once bright, now fallen down angel wings dragged through the dirt old bandages to hide the hurts. we paint our words orange and green-- broken passions kept unseen burning fires and vibrant life now dull and colorless from all the strife. we paint our hearts black and blue-- too many lies we thought were true bruises hidden from spiteful eyes caged inside our own disguises. our pallets empty canvases full the world is running-- we're standing still opaque eyes that hide the stain of bleeding colors and adolescent pains.

      ink smeared across my fingertips-- liquid bruises literary self-abuse. i've been drinking life from a fountain pen sucking out the marrow-- licking lyrics off my lips. swallowing whole the words of poets, only physically dead leaving the imprint of my thoughts on creamy pages, corners bent. ink smearing across my soul again-- black scars of living, tattoed poetic breaths.

      I've started this new blog specifically so that I can have a special place to post all my poetry, and also quotes and song lyrics I like instead of crowding up my other blog with them. all the poetry I post will be from what I have just written onwards, none of my old stuff, just because it would take too long to type it all in. I am going to try to get a guestbook on here pretty soon, but use it more as a comment board on the poetry rather than just a regular guestbook.  Also, I probably don't have to say this to any of you, but just in case... Many of my poems are very personal and relate to pretty sensitive issues going on in my life, so if I have given you this address, that means I trust you not to spread them around or tell other people anything about me that these poems might reveal. but like I said, I don't think any of you would actually do that intentionally :) alright, thats all ~love~ em

      where do you draw the line between love and destruction? i thought i lost you but it was just another summer dream when all the words slur in my mouth like whipped cream and i wanted to scream wanted to scream...  we can't get it right we can't make it true i thought i lost you but it was just another autumn night when all the bruises melt into the firelight i wanted to fight wanted to fight...  where do you draw the line between the earth and the sky? you made me love you you made me cry i wanted to save you but you let me die...  was it love or just destruction? ...and what if there's no line?

      deep down behind the mascara and the frustrated frown look in past the scars and the charred skin where the burn marks fade and the kisses stain underneath the tears but above the pain  fall inside  drop your coat and get comfortable this might take awhile to explain to you why i can't fly can't even try close your eyes and touch the sky but don't ask me why why? why...   i can't fly.

      so this is sort of how i'm feeling right now, i changed around the lyrics a little bit (most notable, from "him" to "her")  Poetic Tragedy ~The Used  the cup is not half empty as pescimists say as far as she's sees nothings left in the cup a whole cup full of nothing for her to induldge since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up   a singer, a writer,  she's not dreaming now of going nowhere  she gave heed to nothing, and all that she was.... is just a tragedy   so she voyages in circles succeeds in getting nowhere and submits to the substance that first got her there   than in violent, frustration she cries out to God  or just no one   is there a point to this madness ? and all that she was.... is just a tragedy   she feels alone her heart in her hand  she's alone she feels alone  I feel....    then on that last day she breaks and she stood tall and she yelled... and she takes his life

      if they x-rayed me they'd see it its pooling in my body cavity flowing down to my ankles clotting in my arms they'd be scared those doctors who know everything one girl can't hold this much all inside of her sometimes i'm afraid that i'll open up my mouth to scream for help and it will all come pouring out rushing out in one flood they'll scream as it pools around their ankles stains the floor but i'll be free i won't have to hold it all in anymore i'll stretch my mouth out open wide until it all flows out to the very last drop of misery.

      Don't hold yourself like that You'll hurt your knees I kissed your mouth and back But that's all I need Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for the sea  Don't throw yourself like that In front of me I kissed your mouth your back Is that all you need? Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for what I give to you Is just what i'm going through This is nothing new No no just another phase of finding what I really need Is what makes me bleed And like a new disease she's still too young to treat Volcanoes melt me down She's still too young I kissed your mouth You do not need me   ~Damien Rice "Volcano"

      as i was rumaging around my room last night, i found a notebook with some poems in it i had totally forgotten about. they were from last year, when i was really depressed, and while most of them are pretty much just emotional vomit, these few are good i think...  about a fight w. my mom :  jerking, tumbling, screaming broken down and bleeding another head on collision and my wounds aren't healing we always walk away a little battered and i'm trying to pretend that what you said doesn't matter but the scars stay and my body aches from bruises-- the ones your words left on me. once again i can't find a winner just two survivors stumbling, weeping, crawling back into our cages where we can rest a little while until this all starts again-- another head on collision  i love you, mom, and i just wish that you would love me, too or at least just pretend...   numb. black. tired. sorry. sorry i failed you i forgive you for failing me but i don't forget never. silent. broken. keep it down. i don't have emotions emotions are for the weak. screaming i'm so sorry-- sorry i failed you. sorry that you can't see how you failed me.  and this one i'm really not sure what its about just cuz it was awhile ago when i wrote it...  i used to sit alone in my room with my head against the wall listening to the music that only i could hear  i used to wrap myself in your arms and lay my head against your shoulder listening to the music that only we two could hear  i used to cry myself to sleep at night with my face pressed into the pillow listening to the music that only the lonely hear  and now i'm sitting next to you with my shoulders straight and head high listening to the music that you will never hear.

       Frail   another promise i made to myself and couldn't keep lies broken on the floor i've tried to be the one that the world leans on but i can't do it anymore. too many times i've tried to be my own messiah crucifying myself on a cross of all my pride thse lies are forcing me to see the truth about myself-- that my so-called strength is just another place to hide. but its gotten to the point  where i can't take this another night i'm tired of living in darkness and pretending i have light i'm scared that i won't wake up from this nightmare i call life and i just need you to be real right now i need this to be alright-- 'cuz i'm slowly losing hope that i'll ever be anything more than frail.

      the pills go in and the vodka follows and suddenly she's spinning golden dreams to swallow and she feels so fucking useless but at least no longer hollow lost inside this nightmare drowning in the shallows  she's lying through her apathy drugged up eyes deceiving afraid of what she might become-- another lost child dreaming 'cause life got twisted and she's forgotten blakc lights darkly gleaming hating all their sympathy but on it slowly feeding  lost control and now she's falling she's so far below  and the car keeps stalling no answer on the phone but i keep calling can't lose another fight got to find her honest-- one last wound tonight.

      about emily's dancing...  on stage with her body taut straining for grace. she takes a step toes pointed-- heels lifting off the black floor-- and as she leaps the sky bends down so that fingers-- grasping at heaven-- touch the cheeks of angels and close upon themselves, blessed. until eyes closed in extasy open to find the beauty in her every step.

      you cry so much i wonder what it means are you really hurting when they flow in saline streams? and what would you do if your world fell down? you've cried so much we're all ready to drown in the puddles and pools of your melodramatic distress about how he hasn't called or you don't fit in that dress. so tell me truly, what does it all mean? are you really heartbroken or still in that dream where your tiny problems warrant such weeping. wake up, little girl, the world isn't sleeping.

      so i guess i found your love-- it was incomprehensible. so i guess i found your strength-- it was insurmountable. so i guess i found your faithfulness-- it was unfathomable. and i guess i found my sin, too but that was unintentional.  i prayed a prayer before i went wanting you to make me new but i realize now how little i wanted  to need to see you. i wanted to be in control didn't really want what i had prayed wanted to be afraid of all this so i could justify my running away. i wanted you to be fallible wanted everything to fall apart so i wouldn't have to trust you or repent of my stubborn heart.  so i thank you for being incomprehensible... insurmountable... unfathomable...  and seeing through the lies that i've been telling from the start.

      a poem for brevard...  i walk up the hill past the food co-op  and the hippy clothing exchange i sing out a hello to the yellow lab in the parkinglot and smile back at all the tourists as they stare at me. i cross the road at a run dodging between minivans and rusted pickup trucks share a silent laugh with a group of college students at the tourists waiting for the light to change at the corner. skip down the sidewalk to the coffee shop sending a smile to the old men sitting out front i stroll inside-- there's a chess game going on in the corner and a girl sits tuning her guitar i grab and iced mocha from Michael across the counter and make my way out the back door. crossing through the gravel parking lots behind all the little tourist-friendly stores, i slip backways through downtown alleys and come out in front of the ice cream place where all the tourists sit with strollers full of fussy children and ice cream dripping down their carefully manicured hands. 50's music blares from the speakers  as waiters climb between crowded and unaturally clean tables a capitalist's wet dream. and i can't help but smile, because its summer and this is my town.

      silk on my skin like being wrapped in midnight fingers on my thigh tap out the rhythm deep within a beating heart  she smiles up with her eyes closed willing away reality i want to close my eyes forever let the diamonds trickle down my cheeks a butterfly kiss a beating heart  i tangle in the stars until blinding light consumes me dancing within the shadow that you forgot to leave behind i only have your memory and it burns right through me trapped inside my beating heart.

      its funny how you stay the same. funny... but not really amusing at all. i keep coming back expecting you all to have changed but you're still waiting there its like i never left in the first place i guess it shouldn't suprise me anymore you're just another set of chains that i've broken free from still hanging around, trying to ensnare me but i've gotten out everyone else... they're still stuck inside you trapped beneath your staggering mundanity the petty games the stupid last names i want to scream at you "don't give in! don't all just be the same!" but they aren't listening too wrapped up in you i never thought that one place could hold so much hate could drag so many people down, kill so many dreams funny, isn't it how unaware i was until it was almost too late funny...but not really amusing  not really amusing at all.

      we watch sound of music in the dark we tend to laugh during all the serious parts we go around for days afterwards singing "THE HILLS ARE ALIVE..."  we tell each other stories only slightly exaggerated we sing snatches of songs only half remembered we fall apart on each others shoulders "...WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC"  we haven't really talked for awhile now i see you now and again but its all changed i remember when we used to dance around to musicals now you've forgotten all the names  i turned the movie off i turned the lights back on with out you... its not the same but for days its going to be stuck in my head "...the hills are alive..." whispered.

      she's taking her eyeliner off ...or whats left after the tears its smudged across her cheeks like bruises emotional punches from the weak  and now she's wiping her lipstick off red...like the blood where she bit her lip it tastes metallic like gunmetal the cowards way out  fantasy bullet to the head  she's taking of her shoes and stockings ripping off confining fabric cages taking it all down until there's nothing but her and the silence in her head  naked. a scared little girl all alone and running away from herself.

      did you see her? down there in the pit with her hands in the air she was screaming dancing around like some fallen angel with her hair all messy flying in her eyes. she had that smile like an exploding star frantic bursts of exuberance before she falls apart down in the dirt, underneath the footsteps of all the friends she's never made all the people who love her but forgot to catch her name were you watching? you should have seen her down there in the pit-- she was dancing for you.

      Well, you better not see me when you come back.  I could be sharin' someone else's pillow.  And my love for you is better than diamonds,  To you, ev'rything, I bestow.  And tomorrow I'll be dancing on my own,  And I'll need a kiss for my head that's achin'.  And I'll be a hungry dog without a bone,  hoping my place with you's not taken.   Kiss me and tell me it's not broken.  Kiss me and kiss me till I'm dead.  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky  and a crown of jewels for your head, now,  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head  One last night in bed for a time,  and two more wishes. and both are for thine.  And three guesses youre the angel's child,  and four hopes this love's not spoiled   Kiss me and tell me it's not broken.  Kiss me and kiss me till I'm dead.  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky  and a crown of jewels for your head, now,  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head now  If you come back, I'll take you to the garden,  we'll dance to an orchestra on the lawn.  And we'll roll in the foggy dew  and dance with the ghosts upon the dawn., on the dawn, on the dawn   (Then you'll) Kiss me and tell me it's not broken.  Kiss me and kiss me till I'm dead.  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky  and a crown of jewels for your head, now,  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head now  for your head, now, oh oh   ~Mundy "To You I Bestow"

      pick up the stars that spilled out of my pocket like dirty confetti from some long-over party sweep out the tears and dried dust mop up the blood and the forgotten dreams pick up all the lost souls and sew back together their seams if you haven't noticed yet we're all falling apart like butterflies the day after their deaths-- still desperately beautiful.... and unfixably broken isn't it sad how all the things i need to say will always be unspoken  the sky seems so horribly empty since i've stolen all its light but i just needed something  to make your eyes glow last night but afterwards when you were still crying and the light that had filled you was already dying the stars seemed so inadequate...just like me and so i spilt them in the dust and didn't care that today they'd be dirty whats the point? i can't make you love me... i can't make myself love you i wanted to make this dream a reality but now its the morning after another dead souls' party

      some more fragments...  okay, so this one is actually a character study.. but i'm not telling who it is!  she moves her hands when she talks big exuberant gestures hands stretched, fingers flung far out her face is never still it folds and changes and flows metamorphosis of emotion   don't remind me i'd rather just forget fade into nothingness and not have to feel i'd rather just be blind i'd rather just be dead i'll just stay the same while you spin inside my head   i'm covered in black and blue red and brown cuts and bruises from when you pushed me down

      my Autumn/Moon/Phoenix poem... :D   Phoenix Moon   when the moon is new and the night is dark outside the city its completely black and the world seems to sit still waiting for something rebirth... renewal... but the moon is new so like the phoenix it rises from the ashes and although we cannot see it this moon is still changing i want to be like the new moon small and silent hiding my incredible light but moving in the darkness not like the full moon gorged full of life only able to decrease and fall away into nothing turn to ashes  when the moon is ne4w and the night is dark outside the city  i like to sit and stare up at the sky waiting for something rebirth... renewal... waiting until like the phoenix-- i rise.

      i woke up to meet you but you were already gone i wanted to sing for you but i forgot the song and you always find me at the worst times when i've smudged out all the battle lines and you're not alone and its not fine.  i woke up to heal you but you weren't broken i wanted to speak to you but the words had already been spoken and you always find me at the worst place when i've smudged all the makeup off my face and you're not here and i'm out of grace.  i woke up to meet you but its all wrong i wanted to keep you but i'm not that strong and i realize i've had you all along can i really be this blind? can you save me? ...do you have the time?

      here's another poem for you. this must be the hundredth, i know it just seems like every time i put pen to paper somehow your name keeps being put down underlined and capitalized as another title for another lonely love song about the only one i ever loved, and how i could never tell you do you ever get tired of reading this? do you ever just scream at the words-- "get over it!" sometimes i do.

      i warned you i told you this would happen i told you i would break your heart is it my fault you didn't believe me? i tried to push you away to close myself off and not listen to you when you said all the things that  i needed to hear-- whispered them in my ear i tried to be strong to be cold to be cruel to keep from killing you just by hurting you a little at the start but you resisted and despite all my misgivings i let you in i opened up i lied and told myself that this time it would be different that  this  time i could get close to someone without destroying them but look where we are now broken down and its all my fault i warned you! why didn't you listen?

      Everybody's talkin' But they don't say a thing They look at me with sad eyes but  I don't want their sympathy  It's cool you didn't want me Sometimes you can't go back  Why'd you have to go and make a mess like that?  Well I just have to say Before I let go...  Have you ever been low? Have you ever had a friend that let you down so? When the truth came out Were you the last to know?  Were you left out in the cold?  'Cause what you did was low  No I don't need your number There's nothing left to say 'Cept  I never thought it'd hurt this much to be saved  My friends are outside waiting I've gotta go  Have you ever been low? (have you ever been) Have you ever had a friend let you down so? When the truth came out Were you the last to know? Were you left out in the cold? 'Cause what you did was low What you did was low What you did was low What you did was low  I walk out of this darkness With no sense of regret And I go with a clear conscience We both know that you can't say that This to show For all the time I loved you so So...  Have you ever been low? (have you ever been) Have you ever had a friend that let you down so? When the truth came out Were you the last to know? Were you left out in the cold? 'Cause what you did was low  Have you ever been low? (have you ever been) Have you ever had a friend that let you down so? When the truth came out Were you the last to know? Were you left out in the cold? 'Cause what you did was low  Have you ever been low? (have you ever been) Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?  'Cause what you did was low...

      this is for you.   i would put the sea to shame with all the tears i'd cry if i could stop one saline stream from flowing out your eye.  and i would rip my heart to shreds and claw apart my soul if there was the smallest chance that it would keep you whole.  but my sacraficial platitudes  seem slightly out of place when i realize i couldn't catch you in your tumble down from grace  but if these words could heal your heart or make you smile again then i'd speak until i had no voice with love, your dearest friend.

       Losing Grip   she wants to run. bare feet pounding heart racing wind whipping hair into her face. she wants to win. arms thrown up head tilted back forgetting everything but the race. she wants to dance. arms outstretched spinning wildly as if there's nothing more. she wants to sing. mouth wide open nostrils flaring like she's never sung before. she wants to reach and stretch and fly she wants to breathe and gasp  and sigh she wants nothing at all except to be alive.  but instead... with hands folded and head bowed she whispers stumbles crawls trying to forget that she ever ran at all.

      i wasn't going to post this. hm.   i could take your tears.  i could deal with crying  and if you screamed at me  i'd pretend you were lying  i could take your hate.  i could ignore harsh words  and if you slammed the door  i'd pretend i hadn't heard  i could take your silence  if you just walked away  and if you never let me speak again  i'd pretend there was nothing left to say   but i can't take your smiles  or your unconcern  i can't take you telling me  you don't love me in return  because if this isn't moodiness  or just a rush of feeling  than all the things you tell me--  i'd have to start believing    oh please don't do this to me  please don't leave me here  i wish you would just cry  ...'cause i could take your tears.

      i tried to write a poem for you today. i wanted to tell you exactly how i feel. i thought that maybe, if i could just put it down on ink then i couldn't back up, and i couldn't deny and then you could just take me as i am no more masks, no more paint just me in my brokeness is that okay for you? maybe thats why i didn't end up writing it. maybe thats why i tore up the paper. maybe i'm just scared that you like me much better when i'm covered up. besides... my tears had smeared the ink anyways.

      this is the song from the dance in church today...  Grief ~Peter Gabriel  It was only one hour ago It was all so different then  Nothing yet has really sunk in  Looks like it always did This flesh and bone Is just the way that we are tied in But there's no one home   I grieve for you And you leave me   So hard to move on Still loving what's gone Say life carries on Carries on and on and on and on  The news that truly shocks Is the empty, empty page While the final rattle rocks Its empty, empty cage And  I can't handle this   I grieve for you You leave me  Let it out and move on Missing what's gone Say life carries on Say life carries on and on and on  Life carries on in the people I meet In everyone that's out on the street In all the dogs and cats In the flies and rats In the rod and the rust In the ashes and the dust Life carries on and on and on and on Life carries on and on and on Life carries on and on and on and on Life carries on and on and on Just the car that we ride in The home we reside in The face that we hide in The way we are tied in As life carries on and on and on and on Life carries on and on and on   Did I dream this belief Or did I believe this dream  Now I will find relief   I grieve

      its cold outside but colder in here with your breath like ice on my face but you can't see the wounds of mine that you're healing with your headlong plunge from grace  its in the way you smile so distant and unfeeling and in the way you curl your toes its the things you said that made me stop believing that i'd find a place you'd ever not appose  its cold outside but inside my head i'm freezing i wonder if it even matters here seeing you like this-- painting on your brokeness-- its not suprising i've forgotten all my fear

      Waste ~Smashmouth (their only good serious song)  I'm lookin' at my watch At all the time that's been stolen When I was carrying you It seems I've tripped and I've fallen Don't want no one to ache Oh to be drunk and forgetful  To get out of this unscathed  Oh to be free and inhuman Some may say  I love to play When the chance is there to take  I'm moppin' up the floor From messy recipes of romance I'm packin' up the pots Too many cooks in the kitchen Some may say  I love to let a good thing go to waste  I let it go to waste Let a good thing go to waste a good thing go to waste Let a good thing go to waste a good thing go to waste I'm lookin' at my watch At all the time that's been stolen When I was carrying you  Seems I've tripped and I've fallen

      she's staring at the streetlight blinking back the tears ignoring all the people as they pass the guys hang out the windows catcalling her fishnet legs not noticing the bruises underneath she'd wipe away the mascara that is drying on her cheeks but instead she leaves it there to scare away the hopefulls standing on the corner under  the public city streetlight she twirls around like a dancer or maybe a boxer about to fight and as she looks into the darkness straining to see herself raises up her timid voice in one final triumphal shout:  "you can't break me. you can't shake me.  you see these scars? they're what make me  i'm not your poster child for pain and if you try to make me fight i'll just slip away  into the night ..."

      Punish My Heaven ~Dark Tranquility   We are the outstretched fingers That seize and hold the wind...  The strangeness of awakening In an oh so silent world Breathlessly waiting For the first proud beams of light As the hours grow longer And the shadows never fall  My sky has forsaken me  My desperation grows Bring me the light In the darkness that never ends The dawn will never come Punish my heaven We have arrived At the outermost crossroads The charge of cosmos At our atmospheric skies Will cause our fall  If I had wings, would I be forgiving?  If I had horns Would there be flames to shy my smile? Hymns of loss are heard From the masses in the streets Praising the last of days I punish Bring me the night In the fires that never end The dawn will never come  Punish my heaven  The charge of cosmos Charging at us from unearthly distance I challenge the universe It's the choice between heaven and hell  My soul bears all the weight of mountains  As mankind weaves its silent end  Can there be no forgiveness?  I curse the heaven above me As the light sinks through My outstretched fingers Fading in my open arms  Make each tear in my bare hands A lifetime in hell  On this last day of light When our autumn leaves fell And as heaven itself commands me Out of its lair My face lined with darkness I'll go!

      How Bout You ~Staind  If someone showed you the way Would you take the wheel and steer?  It hurts me that your not ashamed Of what you're doing here  If they jumped off a bridge Would you meet them on the ground? Or would you try and claim It never made a sound?  Everyone plays the hand they're dealt And learns to walk through life themselves Not everything in life is handed on a plate When people think your words are true It doesn't matter what you do  I sold my soul to get here  How 'bout you?  so you choose to force your hand What a strange way to make friends And  you always change the rules so the drama never ends  And you blindly go through life Judging only by it's worth Just try not to forget That the meek inherit earth  Everyone plays the hand they're dealt And learns to walk through life themselves Not everything in life is handed on a plate When people think your words are true  It does'nt matter what you do  I sold my soul to get here How 'bout you?  So please don't take offence This is just a point of view  'Cause I'm the only one who Will say these things to you   Everyone plays the hand they're dealt And learns to walk through life themselves Not everything in life is handed on a plate When people think your words are true It doesn't matter what you do I sold my soul to get here  How 'bout you?

      if any of you have seen the movie 10 Things I Hate About You... you'll know this. I'm really not sure why i'm posting it up now, it doesnt really aply to my life right now, but i just found it so...   I hate the way you talk to me,   and the way you cut your hair.   I hate the way you drive my car,   I hate it when you stare.   I hate your big dumb combat boots   and the way you read my mind.   I hate you so much it makes me sick,   it even makes me rhyme.   I hate the way you’re always right,   I hate it when you lie.   I hate it when you make me laugh,   even worse when you make me cry.   I hate it when you’re not around,   and the fact that you didn’t call.   But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you,   not even close…   not even a little bit…   not even at all.

      this song pretty much totally describes how i am right now. its by Sarah McLachlan and its called "Fallen"  Heaven bent to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight  Truth be told I've tried my best But somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves THe past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals The lonely light of morning The wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I have held so dear.  I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bent to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turned their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step You'll slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...

      i used to love the way we used to be. back when things were innocent and the simplest answer always solved the problem. people said that growing up was better... so many things to learn, so many dreams to cherish, but they were lying. what they took for maturity was just another term for slow dying. i opened my eyes, and all the visions left them until i'm blind. trusting only to what i feel and that can be severly misleading .sometimes fataly. look at the mistake i made in you-- from past experience, i expected that you would stay true. but here you stand, lying to my face with not a hint of remorse and i'm not sure what to make of it all. i used to love the way you used to be. back when things were simple and we were really free. don't you regret leaving it all behind? don't you wake up in the middle of the night with tears drying on your cheeks left over from the dreams that you will never be able to keep? i want back my naivete.    i want back your love.

      Will You ~POD  See you sittin' next to the window in the bedroom  She breaks down -  breaks down   Crying over something and starin' into nothin'  Afraid now - hate now  Wanting, needing, haunting,  it's killing me   Faking what has happened to live the life like that man   I'll break down  - It's fake now   Will you, will you love me tomorrow?  So Will You,  Will you stay with me today?    Fade in and out of reason to fight the way she's feelin'  She breaks down - breaks down   Going through the motions  and holding onto hopes  and her dreams now - somehow  Shaken, mistaken, forsaken, it's killing me.  Wishing you could change, but he's always been this way   If you leave now - I'll drown    Will you, will you love me tomorrow?  So Will You, Will you stay with me today?  Will you,  will you be here tomorrow?   So Will You, you remember yesterday?   Yesterday! Yesterday!  Yesterday! Yesterday!   This time, I'm sorry  This time, I'm sorry  This time, this time,  I'm sorry for this time   This time, this time, I'm sorry  This time I'm sorry!   Will you,  Will you love me tomorrow?   So Will You, Will you stay with me today?  Will you, Will you be here tomorrow?  So Will You, you remember yesterday?   Will you? [x6] So Will You?  Will you? [x6]

      she's talking to herself again we really should break that habit but don't you think there's enough brokeness already? who knows why things happen someone told me god did but he's not being exactly forthright about it to me. so i've decided to screw all capitals and get back to the basics when everything is small and easily managed do you know what? i guess you don't. its just that i now realized that i've been talking to myself all along i really should break that habit.

      she begins to fade away  as the last words leave her lips--  the caress she never gave  to you  to me  or to the whole world.  she wants to wrap her arms around the universe  and squeeze  clutching handfuls of stars close to her chest  but i supress the urge  to tap her shoulder  and bring her back down here  to earth  or is this hell?  when you fall down low  its hard to tell how far.  and now she's just a ghost  tracing with silver fingertips the words i never wrote  the little things  the pungent smells  of late-night breakfasts at cheap hotels  with you  with me  or with the whole world.  she wants to grab handfuls of reality  and pull  until the sun pops out  like too many packets of katsup  clenched in her fist  i'll open my hand to find  packaged tomato product mixed  with the blood  that flows off my palm  from red crescents--  fingernails  but in my mind  this has already gone stale  and i'm just a shell,  empty inside  from where you ripped the light out  of me  to put in your pocket  and take to show and tell.  where have the kisses gone?  i'm too faded.

      no one ever truly believes in loss until they've lost the thing they cannot live without. i never thought anything could hurt so much until you left-- now i'm left without a doubt.  no one makes me smile the way you used to make me smile and it breaks my heart to know i haven't really smiled in awhile.  no one understands that i can't make them understand the things i didn't mean to say and that without these words to tie me down its very likely i'd have already run away.  no one makes promises anymore that they actually mean to keep. until falling in the water, you don't believe you can ever go to deep.  no one opens up now and no one ever stays the same. it sad to see how we've lost ourselves beneath these waves of shame.  if i could give you one last gift i would make you feel true pain because trying to live while numb and silent will make you go insane.

      I hurt myself today  to see if I still feel  I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real   the needle tears a hole  the old familiar sting  try to kill it all away  but  I remember everything   what have I become?  my sweetest friend  everyone I know  goes away in the ned  you could have it all  my empire of dirt   I will let you down   I will make you hurt  I wear my crown of shit  on my liar's chair   full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair  beneath the stain of time  the feeling disappears  your are someone else  I am still right here   what have I become?   my sweetest friend  everyone I know  goes away in the end   you could have it all  my empire of dirt   I will let you down  I will make you hurt  if I could start again  a million miles away   I would keep myself  I would find a way .

      i need you now but you're not here so where does that leave me? out of luck i guess don't ask me if i ever expected better i'd hate to lie again. if you were listening i'd tell you my story you know, the one where everything works out in the end.  you and i never got a chance for honesty we've been gluing lies to the back of hallmark cards pretending conversation. could we still be friends? maybe if i gave you the chance so where does that leave me? out of grace i guess don't ask me if i ever needed more i hate to lie.

      Short Stories With Tragic Endings ~From Autumn To Ashes  Here you stand seething with guilt. Silence only justifies this act of cowardice. The look stapled on your face cries out for  forgiveness ,  the one thing that I cannot give   (Did you ever see that one person and the way they do these things  and it hurts  you so much it's like choking choking choking down the embers)  I can give you freedom from your guilt, with a flick of my wrist onto yours.  I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile . I can give you death with the look upon my face.  This is your freedom in a life of fallacy, with no last kiss and no regrets;  you don't deserve good bye . This is your freedom in a life of fallacy, with no last kiss and no good bye.  Here you stand seething with guilt. Silence only justifies this act of cowardice.  With a short story, the one you add to daily,  you are the tragic loss . No story book ending for this fairy tale of you. Just the one composed with blood taken from your pen that you hold in your  lifeless hand. Cry for you. Shed tears. Mourn. Wish the end. Cry for you. Shed tears. Mourn.  Wish the end .  (Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person, and the subtle way that they do these things and it hurts so much? So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze. It's that moment when  your eyes seem to spread aspersions  and to scream confessions  at the insipid sky parting clouds . You let this one person come down in the most perfect moment. And it breaks my heart to know the only reason you are here now is A reminder of what I'll never have I'll never have... I'll never... Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.  Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in . But this table for one has become bearable. I now take comfort in this, and for this, I cherish you. Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person and the subtle way that they do these things and it hurts so much? So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze. It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions and to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds. And  you let this one person come down , come down. I cherish you...I cherish you. Just say you would do the same for me. Just say you would do the same for me. Say you would do the same...  Just say you would do the same for me  For as much as I love Autumn, I'm giving myself to Ashes.)

      The Sad Thing    Working up the courage to not say anything I am left alone in my defeat And no one wants to ask uncomfortable questions So I’m given too much room to speak.  Back and forth across the space between us Run the words I never got to say And if you didn’t understand all my cryptic messages I could pretend that I really wanted to stay.  You and I were always just a little too effusive  Honesty’s a bitter pill to take It’s hard trying to walk quietly through this crowd Since silence is the one thing we always break.  Tip-toeing through the awkward moments I’ve become what I always claimed to fear Since I never took the chance to settle things between us I can’t blame you when I try to disappear.  It’s a hazard that comes with the position The ability you have to read my face But I’m adept at keeping you at a distance And the saddest thing is I’m comfortable out of place.

      Dashboard Confessional ~The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most  Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself,  and covered with a perfect shell,  such a charming beautiful exterior. Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect posture, but you're barely scraping by, but  you're barely scraping by .  This is one time that you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all.  And the grave that you refuse to leave  the refuge that you've built to flee  the places you have come to fear the most.    Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself,  and hidden in the public eye.   Such a stellar monument to loneliness .

      Untitled ~AFI  we held hands on the last night on earth. our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields under trees screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. it was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. so we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and  the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease . in our cancer of passion you said, "death is a midnight runner"  the sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide  we picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. the echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. the few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime.  i kissed you at the apex of the malestrom  and asked  if you would accompany me in a quick fall,  but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't for two.  i rode alone . you said, "the cinders are falling like snow"  there is poetry in despair , and we sang with unrivaled beauty bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence, of blue and grey. strange, we ran down desperate streets and carverd our names in the flesh of the city the sun was stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mistery of curves and lines. still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation   scratched into the earth like a message .

      my tongue is coated in dust. i try to scream, but only choke coughing out my dreams. taste the bittersweet denial of all the things you threw at my feet and i, full of pride, left behind. my eyes are full of tears. but streaming down my cheeks they smear in dust. i am all the thoughts you left behind on the floor,waiting to be crushed breathing in sandy suicide. you smell like insense and old dreams. sometimes the world spins around me spins without me. did you catch the wind in your hands? or did you open your mouth to scream-- as your words blow into dust.

      very sad song. very apt. also by Damien Rice.  Silent night, broken night All is fallen when you take your flight I found some hate for you Just for show You found some love for me Thinking I'd go Don't keep me from crying to sleep Sleep in heavenly peace  Silent night, moonlit night Nothing's changed Nothing is right I should be stronger than weeping alone You should be weaker than sending me home I can't stop you fighting to sleep Sleep in heavely peace

      Cannonball ~Damien Rice   Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth  Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt Still a little hard to say what's going on   Still a little bit of your ghost  your witness Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed You step a little closer each day Still I can't say what's going on  Stones taught me to fly  Love taught me to lie  Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall  When you float like a cannonball   Still a little bit of your song in my ear  Still a little bit of your words I long to hear  You step a little closer to me So close that I can't see what's going on  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie  Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall  When you float like a cannon  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to cry  So come on courage! Teach me to be shy  'Cause it's not hard to fall And I don't wanna scare her It's not hard to fall  And I don't wanna lose  It's not hard to grow When you know that you just don't know

      Guernica ~Brand New  Ever since I was young your word is the word that always won. Worry and wake the ones you love. A phone call I'd rather not receive. Please use my body while I sleep. My lungs are fresh and yours to keep, Kept clean and they will let you breathe. Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry? I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind. Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these, so I sat alone and waited out the night. The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed. So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around. I'm not writing my goodbyes. I submit no excuse. If this is what I have to do I owe you every day I wake. If I could I would shrink myself and sink through your skin to your blood cells and remove whatever makes you hurt but I am too weak to be your cure. Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry? I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind. Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these, so I sat alone and waited out the night. The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed. So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around. I'm not writing my goodbyes. I'm not letting you check out. You will beat this starting now and you will always be around. I'm there to monitor your breathing I will watch you while you're sleeping. I will keep you safe and sound. Does anybody remember back when you were very young. Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?

      growing up is realizing that you fucked up.  growing up is figuring out that sometimes you make a mistake and just being sorry won't fix it. just wanting to change won't help. sometimes things get broken and they can't be put back together. you can deny that and always be running around trying to make things better but it wont work eventually you will come back to the one you couldnt save--  and it will drive you crazy. growing up is dying inside. growing up is hating yourself because you're flawed. growing up is finally understanding that only in your flaws are you real.

      were you my shelter or my cage? looking back its hard to weigh comfort against destruction-- security through comformity. you were my safe place for awhile but after i had flown away you were still grasping at my feet pulling me back down into you.  but maybe you were right-- maybe i really was too weak to fly.

      worlds collide inside each sigh i stare into the soul that looks out from your eyes worlds apart too late to start but i found peace inside your bleeding heart  ...  as apocolyptic tears rain down from heaven and your moon shifts the waves into chaotic patterns i find solace in the solitary pain of being loved  ...  my tea is cold i can taste the bitter leaves the residue is sour like half-forgotten fruit becoming rotten. i want you to tell me that you're still the same i want things to be okay between us but this change is  inevitable.  my tea is cold your eyes look bitter i'd taste your smile but it seems sour like a half-forgotten soul left out to rot.

      Look around you  Do you see what you’ve got With something so beautiful Afraid it would drop Into a thousand regrets  And i bet you were left there It’s getting me down And I can’t understand Why everyone stares when i crash at the landing  and around were they stand  Everyone talks again   We try to say with confidence That were picking up oblivion  And I was tryin to make some sense  Speaking to you   We try to say with confidence  That were picking up oblivion  Inside of you  All around you there’s a feeling you lost  That everything beautiful  Is not what it was  Whenever you were on top   Of all you left up there  It’s getting me down  To the place that I land That hits me so hard With a cruel understanding That it might be the end  Everyone talks again  [Repeat Chorus]  I’ll bury myself into the corner  I can’t even tell if I won’t see anymore [2x]

      A Thousand Separations   he smiles over cofee my fingertips ache to trace him i want to stretch out and fill this empty space created by two bodies not quite touching. yet i am still-- a motionless pain pursed lips silently complain and eyes that always say too much speak volumes. its not too late to stay but if i stay any longer  i'm afraid i'll crash and burn and my survival mode is already kicking in. stand to leave hug, then turn and quickly walk away  i remember the day we grew apart-- you were smiling, drinking coffee as you broke my heart.

      pretend ignorance. you like to make them think that you're just like them. but its not true i know. underestimation becomes an art. this deception seems slightly ill-conceived. don't you understand they're only jealous of all the things they'll never get to be? don't buy into this idea that whats best is what makes you like the mob. become unique. they'll love you because we admire what we're not. but what am i saying i do the same. faking conformity. playing their game. becoming what i hate... fake.

      its hard to play victim when holding the bloody knife protests of innocence fall on mostly deaf ears dropping participles, take time to say clearly what you don't mean.  dodge the blame for all misunderstood derelictions pacing off your cell-- the only place you're safe it takes a lot to hide your smile and pretend perception when good intentions always come too late.  who writes the rules here? and why am i always on the outside of your sphere? believing your deception makes it easier for me to hide inside you.  when swallowing the truth whole, make sure to drink one full glass of water don't choke on the jagged ends of all the hearts you break i thought i lost myself somewhere between sugar-sweet pretentions don't bother with hiding, i kept my eyes closed anyways.

      haven't written you anything in awhile so this is the final attempt a last ditch effort to tell you... what? i don't know but i'm sure it was something important it always is. and this is the point at which i start to cry and you bend down and ask, "what's wrong" and i reply with a saline "i'm fine" because its in the script thats my line and really nothings wrong its just me and you know how that goes are you getting this? am i making it clear? oh what a silly question-- how fantastical like i could every really come out here and just say what i mean. this is the point where i look up at the sky trying to avoid your much too knowing eyes and scream loud you give a start and ask, "are you okay" but i'm not answering it wouldn't matter what i said anyways its all in the script.

      okay, so here are some semi-poetic thoughts from tonight.. not so good, but i like 'em anyways.  ...  she's got glamourous eyes marlene deitrich eyes champagne and smoke eyes  ...  E minor A flat tune in to pages rustling voices sighing fingers snap the beat soft A strong G listen for the melody as fingers tap the rhythm tap... tap... tap... are you in-tune to this?  ...  don't think too much about this the best decisions are sometimes made when least expected trust your instincts to a point but don't go too far this could get messy very quickly  don't expect the obvious when we're playing at subtlety

      everything's a little bit too late this time and everyone's a little bit too cold all the good intentions got lost along the way and all your pretty dreams got cheaply sold no one ever told me things would be this hard i wasn't expecting so much pain and if i could leave now, maybe for awhile i'd just stay right here although i can't explain

      do the blown kisses get swept up off the floor along with all of last year's confety? or do the just fade away transcient gifts of lonely little girls down long halways always but not quite finding freedom.  ...  smile for me this once, ballerina how we love your pearly-whites. and i think he's falling hard did you notice? yah, but don't ever let them think that you were right. smile for them and blow kisses take them on don't count the misses until then-- yah, you'll be a star but he's falling hard for you and only you, darling ballerina when you smile.  ...

      threw you the obvious and you flew  with it on your back, a name in your recollection,  thrown down among a million same. difficult not to feel a little bit disappointed  and passed over  when i've looked right through  to see you naked and oblivious  and  you don't see me.but i threw you the obvious  just to see if there's more behind the eyes  of a fallen angel,  the eyes of a tragedy. here i am expecting just a little bit  too much from the wounded. but i see through it all  and see you. so i threw you the obvious  to see what occurs behind the eyes of a fallen angel,  eyes of a tragedy.  oh well. apparently nothing. you don't see me.  you don't see me at all.

      i hate the "serenity prayer":  give me strength to change what i can courage to live with the things i can't and wisdom to know the difference . you know why i hate it? because i'm not strong. i'm not brave. and i'm definetly not wise. i'm weak and scared and foolish. and i like it that way. i don't want to go through life making no mistakes because then i would never be able to grow and even then, no matter how great i was eventually i would break down. because no one can always be right and no one can always do the right thing. and sometimes, not matter how right you are its not enough. so i have decided to write my own "serenity prayer":  make me weak so that i must rely on your strength make me frightened and then wrap your arms around me never let me think for a moment that i could ever be big enough to take care of things myself and although i'm blind,  never let me be too blind to not see your face.

      Turning A Corner   hands grip the stearing wheel slippery with nervous sweat eyes squint through sunlight and plexi-glass trying to control the road ahead lights change people move the world quickens its pace as we careen through nothingness encased in two-thousand pounds of death. don't speak just watch for the right signs she's turning the corner and  it might work out alright but then again there's always the outside chance of head on collision but who can tell what stares us down from around the next curve? sing along to your radio try not to think about it and maybe just maybe you'll come through.

       Subtle Doctrines    bad things don't happen to good people. if something has gone wrong, you obviously sinned. God doesn't let his people down. if you struggle with something you should just trust him more. as long as you eat well, you'll stay healthy. avoid fatty foods and don't smoke cigarrettes. if there's ever a problem don't feel free to call no one wants to hear you whine about whatever you're dealing with. take it to jesus, i'm sure he wants to listen. just smile and nodd and things will work out just fine. feel free to be rude as long as its honest. it doesn't matter what your motives are as long as you smile and act kind.  if you're collapsing-- don't show it. if you're burdened-- buck up. if you're comfortable-- don't blow it. if you're hurting-- so what.  good little christians don't have big ugly problems. isn't that what we've tried to tell you from day one? submit to false charity and take it with gratitude no one likes someone who can't save their face.

      once again, a song describes my life.  (Seether--Sympathetic)   And my words will be here  when I’m gone  As I’m fading away against the wind And the words you left me linger on As  I’m failing again now , never to change this   And I’m sympathetic,  never letting on I feel the way I do As  I’m falling apart again  at the seam  And it seems I’m alone here,  hollow again  As I’m flailing again against the wind And the scars I am left with swallow again As I’m failing again now,  never to change this   And I’m sympathetic,   never letting on I feel the way I do  As I’m falling apart again at the seam And I’m sympathetic,  never letting on I feel the way I do As  I’m falling apart again at the seam    The same old feelings are taking over   and I can’t seem to make them go away  And  I can’t take all the pressure  sober,  but I can’t seem to  make it go away   The same old feelings are taking over and  I can’t seem to make them go away   And I can’t take all the pressure sober  (I can’t make it go away. I can’t make it go away)  And I’m sympathetic, never letting on I feel the way I do As  I’m falling apart again  at the seam And I’m sympathetic,  never letting on I feel the way I do As I’m falling apart again at the seam  And I’m falling , falling, falling,  falling, falling, falling, falling   Apart again at the seam

      cynical, i know. downright feminist-nazi-bitch if you want to quibble. but it was written on a whim and so i post it on a whim, and if you're not in a whimsical mood at the time that you start reading it-- come back later, i think you'll be less offended(or more entertained) if you do :)    Frog-Lips(the everyday prince)   okay. so here's my problem with prince charming: why did that "wicked old witch" turn him into a frog anyways? i mean, how many wicked old ladies out there who just like to turn "upstanding young men" into frogs? plausible? i think not. so what did he do? was he just aggravating or really flawed in some deep and unamed way? i mean, mutation into an animal is some serious shit. woops, did i say a bad word again? guess i'm never going to be the princess in  your  story but i'm not burned. and what happened to that oh-so-lovely princess, anyways? i mean after she kissed him did they  really  live "happily ever after" do you  really  believe that? honestly. because all around me every day i see a lot of prince-charmings walking around with their pretty-princesses they're just a little tarnished. yup, i find them at the grocery store and the gas station or in the parking lot in their rusted out car don't you see? "once upon a time" they thought love was like a fairytale but ten years past and she got fat and he lost his job and where are they now? he's still got  those oh-so-froglike qualities and she's probably still a snob with a weird animal kissing tendency. can you spell dysfunction? d-y-s.... and besides, that "wicked old witch" was probably a very beautiful princess in her day ever think of that? she probably had some lovely prince under some wicked spell and risked her life only to find out... what? well, that maybe he deserved it all along so before you go kissing frogs or kissing princes keep in mind: fairytales are fairytales because it won't happen in real life.

      Bandages  missing the melodrama. have i found true stability or is this just the eye of another storm? come through the flames scathed and scarred like that one trip to the beach when the sun was so hot it blistered my arms. they told me you'd be there. was i looking too hard or were you just hiding in plain sight? missing the sureity of pain. missing the feeling of brokeness. i am like a taped-together birthday card so much love so little life reality tripped me up and my knees are still raw. you said you'd never leave but i'm reading your goodbye over again its written on your face for all to see. i climbed out of the wreckage harmed and lost because in those years i lost a lot including faith.

      Enigmaticy  fingers pick away at the seams of her bag outside in the sunlight with the shiny white cars reflecting blue sky and the ice cream melting on my spoon could you imagine? ice cream in february... its one of those carolina moments that never come too soon but always stay too long-- like relatives or homeless animals that you feed once out of pity or fear of bad karma because who wants to be reincarnated as a soap bubble? but then we never really believed in that anyways like zodiac signs and obsolete psychic hotlines too bad no one actually met that tall dark handsome stranger as predicted instead it was the guy at work or the girl who grooms your dog simple people in your league ...whatever league you happen to belong to but she's in another category shiny black hair slowly destroying the purse and all the wisdom of the world is written on dirty american flag converses half unlaced because capitalism killed all the lillies  along with the thorns but humanity insists in enigmaticy is that even a word? and if all my ice cream hadn't melted before it reached my chapped pink lips and if the sun hadn't gone down  and the cars driven away maybe i would have reached down with some drying-out sharpie marker and written my new word on her shoe or bag because some things only come once and leave before you fully understand and so our modern prophets scrawl lyrics on subway walls and scratch names into park benches trying to define the undefinable.

      She’s got eyes to watch the world fall— That beautiful girl in the back corner stall Sipping her coffee and slitting her wrists, Her short stories all end with twists. Got too much feeling and too little time To pull out her sanity and watch it unwind Licking her lips and tasting the sky Breathing in cancer as she watches me die. She’s got a laugh to make the world dance— Offers you pearls but there’s no second chance. Wants to be free but just ends up alone Making prank calls on her broken cell phone, Writing her wisdom on a blank bathroom wall— That beautiful girl in the back corner stall.

       A Poem For Today   I have seen better sunrises-- glinting off of green-grey oceans; sifting over sky-rise filled cityscapes; rising red behind monolithic mountains; but today I felt the earth breathe.  I have tasted sweeter stolen summers-- glorying in golden sunshine; breathing in blue twilight beneath bright stars; licking drops of lemonade off languid lips; but today I heard the sky sing.  I have had better days than this-- when everything made sense to me; there was a purpose for every person and darkness hadn't crept into my dreams but I woke up this morning  and it is a good day.

      Bleeding thoughts Cracking boulder  Don't fall over Fake your laughter  Burn the tear Sing it louder, Twist and shout  Way up here We stand on shoulders Growing colder  Laugh or cry I won't mind  Sing it louder, Twist and shout  Immovable shadows Concrete girl They'll rock your world To nothing And they're swimming Around again, again And they're swimming Around again, again  And they're swimming Around the concrete girl   Catch your breath Like four leaf clover Hand it over   Scream to no one   Take your time Sing it louder,  Twist and shout   Nothing to run from  Is worse than something  And all your fears Of nothing And they're swimming around  Again, again And they're swimming around  The concrete girl  Concrete girl  Don't fall down  In this broken world  Around you Concrete girl Don't fall down Don't fall down My concrete girl  Don't stop thinking  Don't stop feeling   One step away  From where we were And one step back To nothing  And we're standing on top Of our hopes and fears  And we're fighting for words now Concrete girl And we're swimming around Again, again And we're swimming around now Concrete girl ~Switchfoot

       Dancing Towards Sunrise  (on being not quite prepared for preparation)   she wants to be a princess dressed up in a wedding dress that seems so borrowed, not quite owned and he's her man the one she clings to everything she's always wanted but doesn't need  and i know you listen to the whispers on the telephone ear pressed up against the door so you're always apologizing for what i didn't mean and i'm still angry  give me a moment of your time i'd talk the world to you and he breathes oxygen to make you feel alive but thats nothing new cuz you've always had a prince dreamed up inside that dreamy head and you're always broken hearted because no one stands up to your expectations so you lower the bar until its under your feet  she wants to be a princess like a little girl dressed up for nothing with her pretty dress dragged down in the mud but she pretends not to care whispers over the telephone-- "it doesn't matter" when it does  she wears inhibition like a long black glove.

      sort of a free verse...whatever...   Casualties of War   every day on every street in every town there is a war going on beneath the surface. you can't see it but you feel it in the soles of you feet and the palms of your hands. it is the the thought that lingers in the back of your mind and the imatge you see when you close your eyes. you may have ignored it for most of your life but you've stopped running away now because you've realized that no matter where you go you cannot escape it, and you can't deny it forever. it is the call to revolution-- the tiny whisper that becomes a heartbreaking scream reverberating in your scull. we are the soldiers in a fight for freedom. you may hate us but you can't ignore us-- so what it all comes down to is a single question: are you ready to live? are you willing to break down the walls that everyone has built around you to try and keep you caged and broken? we are silent warriors-- tearing down barriers and redefining the world that you so blindly live in. wake up! stop dying complacently and start living the life that is out there for you. don't settle for comfortable insanity. don't be afraid to challenge the established norm. become something more than just another casualty in an unseen war.

       Unexpected Grace   found hope here-- beneath all the trash and broken dreams when i'd lost it all and come apart at the seams you were there-- to pick up my peices and bandage my wounds unexpectedly.  found love here-- behind desperate eyes and hopeless souls when there was nothing left for me to control you were there-- to carry me through and dry all my tears unexpectedly.  found grace here-- after the fire and the cleansing pain when i had nothing to lose and only you to gain you were there-- opening your arms and receiving me home unexpectedly.

      this song is Less Like Scars by Sarah Groves and its probably one of the most beautiful worship songs i've heard in a long time...   It's been a hard year  But I'm climbing out of the rubble  These lessons are hard  Healing changes are subtle  But every day it's   Less like tearing, more like building  Less like captive, more like willing  Less like breakdown, more like surrender  Less like haunting, more like remember   And I feel you here  And you're picking up the pieces  Forever faithful  It seemed out of my hands, a bad situation  But you are able  And in your hands the pain and hurt  Look less like scars and more like  Character   Less like a prison, more like my room  It's less like a casket, more like a womb  Less like dying, more like transcending  Less like fear, less like an ending   And I feel you here  And you're picking up the pieces  Forever faithful  It seemed out of my hands, a bad situation  But you are able  And in your hands the pain and hurt  Look less like scars   Just a little while ago  I couldn't feel the power or the hope  I couldn't cope, I couldn't feel a thing  Just a little while back  I was desperate, broken, laid out, hoping  You would come   And I need you  And I want you here  And I feel you   And I know you're here  And you're picking up the pieces  Forever faithful  It seemed out of my hands, a bad, bad situation  But you are able   And in your hands the pain and hurt  Look less like scars (x3)   And more like  Character

      she's porcelain: easily broken  glued together in places that shouldn't have been shattered  got a lot of lovely scars to show the world wounds went deep but she survived and isn't that the story of her life:  grew up too late lost inside no one bothered to mention that the world was cruel and you had to be cold to stay alive  but what is there to say now what words can replace the memories that haunt her eyes  she's porcelain: easily broken i can't hear your screaming soft-spoken.

      what if "the best you could" wasn't good enough? what if  you were broken from the start? what if no matter how hard you tried you were a failure? what if every loving smile became a broken heart? what if the lies you said turned true on you? what if "all you had" wasn't anything at all? what if you opened up and only got hurt again? what if they were laughing as they watched you fall? what if you had it all and still had nothing? what if you were lonely though not alone? what if you couldn't make it no matter how fast you were running? what if no one loved you not at all?  what if the baggage you left found its way home? what if you still scream when you're all alone? what if you call and i don't pick up the phone?  who will save you?

       crawling down the road to nowhere   where did her feet go? they wonder but they don't ask.  she took them off long ago left them by the roadside with her empty flask. got tired of painting her toenails got tired of walking away so she sat down and took them off one day.  where did her hands go? they wonder but they don't know.  she got tired of carrying them around so she took them off awhile ago. wanted to be free from chains but her handcuffs had no key so one day she took both her hands off and got free.  where did her dreams go? they wonder but the can't see.  they filled up her head until she got confused and lost reality. so she's wandering around on this old road to nowhere with no hands to hold and no feet to take her and no dreams to wish for and nothing to save her  started out running down a road to salvation lost all she had and no one ever mentioned that she was on the wrong path if she was looking for redemption 'cuz this road goes nowhere.

      when you left i put on a brave face ...after the tears and i said, "two years isn't that long" and promised to still be friends. but then things happened, you changed, and god knows i changed, too and two years became just enough time to realize ...i don't know you. they tell me you're happy and i hope thats true but they say a lot of things about you. they tell me, "she's better off" because you're more like them and they promise ...just like they did two years ago that we'll still be friends. but i've seen the pictures, read the letters, cried the tears... and i've realized that a lot of things can change in just two years.

      i wonder what Icharus' fatal mistake was: flying too close to the sun or not using super-glue to hold his wings together?

      when she says it doesn't matter be careful-- it really does. and when she says its okay its probably not. we are creatures of habit with the soft eyes and cruel tongues creatures of constancy... except when we're not. and when you're on the outside looking in, confused i like to think that its okay, and it doesnt matter even though it does.

      If it makes you less sad  I will die by your hand  I hope you find out what you want  I already know what I am  And if it makes you less sad  We'll start talking again  And you can tell me how vile  I already know that I am  I'll grow old  Start acting my age  I'll be a brand new day  In a life that you hate  A crown of gold  A heart that's harder than stone  And it hurts a whole lot  But it's missed when it's gone  Call me a safe bet  But I'm betting I'm not  I'm glad that you can forgive  I'm only hoping as time goes  That you can forget  If it makes you less sad  I'll move out of the state  You can keep to yourself  I'll keep out of your way  And if it makes you less sad  I'll take your pictures all down  Every picture you paint  I will paint myself out  It's cold as a tomb  And it's dark in your room  When I sneak to your bed  To pour salt in your wounds  So call it quits  Or get a grip  You say you wanted a solution  You just wanted to be missed  Call me a safe bet  I'm betting I'm not  I'm glad that you can forgive  I'm only hoping as time goes  You can forget  (So you can forget)  (You can forget)  You are calm and reposed  It lets your beauty unfold  Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones  Spring keeps you ever close  You are second hand smoke  You are so fragile and thin  Standing trial for your sins  Holding onto yourself the best you can  You are the smell before rain  You are the blood in my veins  Call me a safe bet  I'm betting I'm not  I'm glad that you can forgive  I'm only hoping as time goes  You can forget ~Brand New

      you know, i don't really even notice them anymore unless you mention them and then it is only with a sort of sick regret that i remember the times when i was alive enough to feel that way. there is an incredible immortality in the constant deception of death. i used to dance all night long and the dreams that came...  i am unused to normalcy at night i still wish for the jagged lines of emotion, the twisted turnings of every passionate heartbeat, the indescribable wash of feeling that comes after quite urgently realizing that one is no longer numb. oxygen is perilously addictive when one is always on the verge of suffocating. i used to dream all night long and when i woke...  you know, i don't really notice them anymore unless you point them out with your cloying condescencion that you like to mask with concern. someday when i am old and nothing matters anymore i will again unveil the old tricks of my macabre trade and whispering into some dilapidated grandchild's ear, say, "these are my scars"  ...that you don't notice anyways.

      you know, it isn't all about you. in fact,  sometimes its not about you at all. sometimes i don't even think of you or how it might look to you sometimes i don't care ...bet you've never thought of that before. you need to be less  self-centered i know  that sounds funny coming from me but its really hard to talk to you when you think everything i say has some hidden meaning. sometimes i'm not lying to you sometimes i'm not lying at all. sometimes it doesn't even matter enough for me to even think about lying or telling you something other than the truth ...but maybe you don't want that to be truth maybe you'd rather pretend i'm lying so that you can pretend like you're okay and i think thats shitty. because, everything isn't about you and everything isn't your fault and everyone's not talking about you and no one laughs when you fall. honestly, we're all self-centered and we all like to think that the world revolves around us but it doesn't do you understand that? whatever    ...you know, this isn't about you either.

       all the walls i build around me   made of tissue paper and gauze   draping the card castle i hide within   feigning protection   praying that there's no wind   please don't breathe too strongly   i'll fall apart again.

       yes, darling, this one  is  for you.    &nbsp;   &nbsp; trying so hard to be everything for everyone but yourself-- always ending up inadequate. searching for acceptance from all the people who ignore you-- it breaks you down but they don't deserve you.  and you don't see it but I know that its true-- that all the things you're afraid of could never add up to be as good as you. because you've got something deep inside-- it makes you cry but it also makes you beautiful.  &nbsp;

       violent acts on a sunday afternoon:    &nbsp; crawling from the wreckage barely alive but exhilarated with bruises where bruises should never be  lips that stink of old death vitriolic last breathes bloody kisses that bring me to my knees  love is like a car-crash.

      i am the only one to blame for this  somehow it all ends up the same  soaring on the wings of selfish pride-- i flew to high  and like icharus i collide    i never really wanted you to see      the screwed up side of me that i keep      locked inside of me so deep      and i never really wanted you to know      so many things you shouldn't have been shown     but i never meant to cause you trouble    no i never meant to do you harm    i never meant to cause you trouble    oh no, i never meant to do you harm    and you could have it all    my empire of dirt    i will let you down    i will make you hurt    but if i traded it all    if i&nbsp;gave it all away for one thing    just for one thing    and if i sorted it out-- if i knew all about this one thing    wouldn't that be something?     &nbsp;&nbsp;   jarsofclay...crossfade...coldplay...nineinchnails...fingereleven    &nbsp;

      I don't care anymore if I let you down I believe that I need to be free I'm so used to my life with you around I don't know anymore....the real me  And I thought that I found myself And I thought that I had control All the chains in my life just fell away For a moment I didn't need you  All these tears that I've cried You must be tired of taking care of me but Its what you do best and  I'm a liar cause really its what I need  And I thought that I found myself today And I thought that I had control All the chainsin my life just fell away For a moment I didn't need you  Someone like you Someone like me Maybe its chains that set you free Free....  And I thought that I found myself today And I thought that I had control All the chains in my life just fell away For a moment I didn't need you  And I thought that I found myself today And I thought that I had control All the chains in my life just fell away For a moment I didn't need you ~Smile Empty Soul

      i don't want to write anything for you because it would be a betrayal of all hope and i don't even know what's going on so how can i say that everything's gone wrong? but i know it has. you were there when no one else was and when i couldn't believe anything you smiled and said, "it will be okay" and i believed that because i have always believed in you... no matter what you do. no one is saying anything but that says everything to me i didn't sleep last night because i was afraid to dream afraid the dreams would turn out true-- and i'd lose you. but i refuse to believe anything that no one's saying and today is the first day i'll spend the whole day praying hoping that someone up there's listening when i scream that you mean so much to me ...and that means everything.

       the plans i made still have you in them   when you come swimming into view   and  i'm hanging on your words  like i always used to do   the words they use so lightly   i only feel for you   i only know because i carry you around   in the background      you're yelling "how we living?"  cause  you got the ball  then you rock on, baby, rock on you rock on on and on you're a summertime hottie with your socks in the air screaming, "i don't care baby i don't care  no !" you say you don't know you say you don't know ( you're the marigold )  all i know is  we're missing you   (third eye blind)

      if i were a pirate life would be great i'd have a long curly mustache and treasure in crates i would strut around in big leather boots looking daring and dashing and counting my loot i would get to call people "landlubbers" and "scurvy dogs" and each night i'd eat salt pork and drink gallons of grog  if i were a pirate life would be grand my world would be made up of salt water and sand i'd travel the world in my beautiful ship and if people chased me i could just give them the slip i'd have the loyalest crew of villains and theives with guns in their sashes and knives up their sleaves  if i were a pirate life would be good i'd never have to worry about doing "what i should" i could stay up all night and sleep until noon and then lurch around in a grog-induced swoon i'd be free as a bird-- there'd be nothing wrong and whenever i wanted i could sing dirty songs  if i were a pirate things might be okay because i wouldn't have to deal with shit every day i could draw on my mustache and sail into the blue always searching for something exciting and new and if i ever got lonely i could remind myself of this: that being a pirate was my one desperate wish.
