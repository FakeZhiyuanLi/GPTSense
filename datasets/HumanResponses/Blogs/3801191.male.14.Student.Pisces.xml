      Decided to switch to blogspot, after the constant breaking down of dland, and mei's constant advice...  So yea...sorry nic, but im makin the switch...  You'll notice something else about this blog...the title  So yea...heres goes my rant for today  MY MOM IS A BITCH!!!  Why am i sayin this? Simple...lets take a little walk back in time...to this afternoon  This Friday is St. John's day...and just so happens that i got chosen to be in the GOH marching contingent for the occassion.  Anyway, this year, our OTCs decided to break the tradition of camping over in school the night b4 SJAB day, however, on the condition that we checked in our uniforms to make sure that certain INDIVIDUALS *cough*sae chong*cough**cough* did not leave any part of the full uniform at home...which would spell doom for all of us. Anyway, we had to check the uniforms in today, and have em inspected by our CSM, Kailun, and as such, i told my mom that id be finishing a lil later. "Nvm," she sed..."ill just park down at the SJAB room and wait. Dun worry, take your time..."  Now, earlier on...when school let out, i rushed down to the SJAB room to book in my uniform. On my way down, hsien hui stopped me, and asked is i could help him chek his full u in as well (apparently...our dear chinese teacher *er hem**prepares chi-na accent* HWARNG LAU SHHI had asked him to finish up some admin stuff after school that day), so, fine, i told him id do it...  Now, here's where it all started. On my way to the SJAB room, i called my mom to tell her that i might take a lil while longer complete the booking in of the uniforms, and right after that, i thought i left my hp on...  About 20 mins after i stepped into the st john's room, i had finished the uniform inspection, and was just clearing up the paper bags and stuff i used to carry the uniforms in...when all of a sudden, my mom storms into the SJAB room and starts railing "SHERWIN TAY! HOW MUCH LONGER ARE U GOING TO TAKE!!! IVE GOT AN APOINTMENT AT 4 PM U KNOW???". I try to tell her that ill be finished as soon as im done clearing...but what happens? SHE WONT EVEN LET ME GET A SINGLE WORD IN EDGEWISE!!! So fine, i ask nikhil to help me clear it up, and i run off...watever happened to her words of "Dun worry, take your time..."?  Now, as soon as i jump into the car, my mom tells me, "WHY DIDNT U SWITCH ON YOUR HP!!!". I whip out my hp to discover that its off...  and so i go "Eh? I thought it was on...". Next thing i know, shes schitzing it, and yellin "U ALWAYS HAVE AN EXCUSE ONE, YOURE ALWAYS NOT WRONG",l and im like wtf? Next thing she goes "YOURE SO STUPID, EVEN THAT DOG OF YOURS IS SMARTER THAN YOU!!!". Im normally not one to waste time arguing with parents... but maybe becos i was having a bad day, i was tired, and i was well and thoroughly pissed-off by her offensive remark, something inside me just snapped and i started yelling.  And while all this was happening, those caller alert sms's tellin me that my mom tried to call were coming in nonstop...come on, if someone's phone is off, and u know that it is..how many fuckin times do u have to call b4 youre satisfied? I had a grand total of 25 of them! Buit the next thing my mom did really made me pissed... she sed "Orh, somebody very busy hor!!! U think i dont know! How many girls have u been seeing outside? Whole day onli know how 2 sms! I tell u ar...one of these days, im gonna confiscate that hp of yours!!!". Im like, WTF?, and i stick the damn phone in her face to show her that all; those bloody sms were caused by her!!! This only made her even nmore pissed, and she was railing all the way bak home...din bother to listen to wat she was saying...save for the part about me being stupid, which i yelled at her about...  So, with all the shouting going on, i just let everything flow out, and i eventualy brought up this statement "SO EVERYTHING I DO OR SAY IS WRONG???", and she sez "YES". A little while later, i sed "NO NEED TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS ANYMORE, YOURE ALWAYS RIGHT LAH, EVERYONE ELSE IS ALWAYS WRONG, ESPECIALLY ME"...and u know wad she sed? She sed "DID I SAY THAT? DONT PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH!!!". WAT THE FUCK MAN!!!  MOm, if u are reading this, YOUR A FUCKIN PSYCHO CONTROL FREAK! EVERYONE HATES U, AND U CAN GO GET HIT BY A TRUCK AND NO ONE COULD CARE LESS!!! FUCK U, U SCREWED UP CHE'S LIFE, NOW YOURE TRYING TO SCREW UP MINE!!! Y DONT U GO TAKE IT OUT ON THAT BITCH KNWOWN AS SERENE TAY??? WHY US??? FUCK U!!! I HATE U!!!!!!!!!!!!

      The lights in the distance Flicker in the eternal night Guided by the clicking Of my weary soles  Hit me suddenly It did  What is this warm feelin?  A foothold And a hand Reach out of the darkness  The sprawling tree Now radiant Basking in the lunar tides  Jagged rays Ground Solid to soft  Two figures remain as one  &nbsp;

      Seriously, im gettin so wussy i feel like punching myself...  Once again...this blog shall be used for its proper purpose...  RANTS...  And, nic gave me a good idea...  Utter, total randomness...the food of creativity...  So, here goes...   SONGS   What is it with songs these days? Why da heck do they all have to b about love, i mean, come on, not the whole frickin world is accidentally in love now are they?  Marketing ploy...HAH! I wish i could believe that...  Hey, if u want your CD to sell so badly, theres such a thing as GOOD ADVERTISING...  No need to make those in love become more gushy, and the unlucky ones feel more depressed dammit...i myself was a victim of this outrage...   GLOBALISATION   Sure...its cheaper...  But by the time it reaches you, how much do they charge u for your products?  Wat the fiack is this...they pay those poor folks like 5 cents a day...  And they sell the stuff at 30 bucks a pop???   Come on...  Is everyone blinded by the need for more and more money these days? Come on, watever happened to the spirit of brotherly love...  Theyd even exploit other human beings, just for the sake of their own greed...   ADVERTISING   Watever happened to good, wholesome advertising?   Remember the ad nokia used to have...  Yes, way bak in the heyday of the 8850...  The one where they had the town mayor playin snake while sitting barefooted on the town fountain...  The one where they had all those people smiling and having fun?  And wat are they usin now?  NIGHTLIFE...  PARTIES...  My god...  Im startin to wonder wat advertising will b like when im an adult, and my kids watch TV...  Watll we have?  Nude models?   Porn?   Wat the fiack...i certainly wouldnt want my kids to b exposed to that kinda crap  IMO, advertising is greasin to hit the skids...  One day, its gonna burst...  BURST LIKE A BALLOON FULL OF CRAP  *cough**cough*...  Yes, all i have for the moment...will now commence to slip into deep thought while chanting "waaaaatttt tttthhhhheeeee ffiiiiaaaaccckkkk"...  Cya soon peeps...

      There exist little things called secrets Which dwell within the mind They are always there But not always to find  Though some may wish to know them Theyre not always to tell Though others try to avoid them Someone always TELLS...

       Sometimes You may love someone deeply Yet the tides never turn in your favour To let them know  Sometimes it takes  Another light in the darkness To make you realise your feelings for someone  Yet most of the time The real light  We all search for Tends to be right beside us...

The dude with the vulcan eyebrow, yes you...come on up here  At an 8 hour torture session?   Congratulations, here's your prize...*slaps mal with a trout*...  Anyway...yep, just went to hell and back, literally...  Lets see...how shall i put this? Imagine this...  The sun beatin down on u so hard that your skin threatens to peel off...  Your boots fryin, and u wishin that you didnt listen to your OTC's advice and use instantshine to polish em...  And yes, add this to the mix, a butch with the same name as one of your best friends shouting drill orders at you...and round after round of punishment...  Yes, every frickin bone in my body aches now...and my shoulders feel like i just took up a full-time job as a coolie. My muscles scream and burn whenever i move now...man, now i know wat gollum feels like...  On top of that, ive got this dull, throbbing pain in my head...and im frickin scared that im gonna get hit by another mental block...  ARG...  At least its over now, and i can take time to relax...and write a few shout outs;  Mei: AAAAAAAAAH, leavin me al alone...*sobs*  Mal: One word...and youre skrewed...  Lye Kuang: Fuck u  Brandon: Do not, i repeat, DO NOT drop the flagpole during drills...  Yes, one liners...but i dont care now, do I?

      *MEEEMMMOOORRRIIIIEEESSS...AALLL ALLOONNNEEE IIN THE MOONLIIGHT...*  *er hem*  *switches off radio*  Was lookin at old photos today...yep, photos from WAAAAYYYY back when...  Yup, happy memories of my childhood... old friends... birthday parties...*sighs*  I've come to realise somethin today...  Friends come...friends go...  But photos are always there to remind you of all the happy times u shared with them.  I also took some time to ponder this point, how many of my friends from the past are still my friends now?  Well, i found out one thing's for sure, friends may come and go...but true friendships ALWAYS survive the ravages of time and distance...as i found out recently.  Recently, i hooked up with an ex-neighbour of mine, Samantha. Now, ive lost contact with her for many years, but when we met up, we chatted and fooled around just like we did in the past.  Ok, backtrack a bit...lemme explain to u guys our past...  Samantha and I were great friends when we were young. We used to cycle together every afternoon, and do all sorts of crazy stuff together. Stealin rambutans (yes, i was too young to know jak shit bak then...lol), playin with mimosas, fooling around in the park...ar..too many things to mention! We did lots of stuff together, and our friendship grew and grew...  Till one day...that fateful day...the day i would never forget...  Well, it was pretty normal, but for some reason i still remember that day like no other...  I still remember the only strange thing that happened that day, was samantha was unusually quiet for some reason, and right after our usual 2 hour session of playin... she handed me a piece of paper and ran off crying...  I didnt really think much of it until that evening. I pulled the letter out of my pocket and read it...  The reaction was immediate, teras welled up in my eyes, and i cried...  She was movin the next mornin, and she didnt leave me with any contact no....  I was p5 bak then, and i had a hard time gettin over that...  Well, its been slightly over 2 years since that day...and just a month or so ago, i met up with Samantha once again. I had found her through a friend of mine. We chatted for a week or so, and then we agreed to meet up.   That mornin, i was dressed in my finest (well, finest meanin a quiksilver polo and jeans anyway...), and sittin in coffee bean sipping a huge cuppa (wat is it with their huge cups???). All of a sudden, my world suddenly went quiet, and my eyes suddenly affixed onto a WOOOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHHH young lady standin at the door for some reason...the next thing came as a real shocker...  "SHERWIN TAY!!! IS THAT U?"  Samantha???  Boy had she changed since the last time we met...she had gone from the sweet, innocent, little girl-next-door, to an intelligent, witty looker...she had matured a LOT (same cant b said for me though). Still, though we just barely managed to recognise each other after so long...we chatted like old pals, picking up where we left off..and catching up on years of stories...  My point is? No matter how much time u spend apart from a friend, or no matter how little contact u make with the person, as long as the friendship is true...itll last forever

      Well, the weekends almost here, and for once in my lifetime...im actually NOT looking forward to it...  Lets see, for starters, this saturday is gonna b the start of the POP sessions...and yes, im gonna have to see Ng Lye Kuang's freaky face again...yep, peeps, if im in IMH on sunday undergoin therapy for severe mental shock, you know wat happened...lets see...lemme explain this in an equation...  POP Sessions + Me = Ng Lye Kuang + Hot Sun + Standing still for 8-plus hours = ME goin MADDD...  Get the picture? Nvm...  On top of that, i got dumped on by almost every teacher...a.k.a. Ive now got a 30cm pile of assignments on my table to complete...lets see...math...history...science...chinese...oh yes, did i mention that ive gota finish the damned poster for IVP? *sigh*  On a brighter note... we had the re-test for the NCO theory test today. Apparently, every single one of us failed the first time round...   Cold sweat pouring down Drenching me into the ground The clock ebbs The slides change The papers crinkle  The soft scribbling of pens Resonates around the room of terrors Bounces off the walls Like a ghostly echo  The time ticks away Ten seconds left   The atmosphere of the room...was just...just...y'know  Well yea...Kejia bombed on that one...and to save herself from the rath of the commissioner, she had to give us a retest...even though she originally claimed that "a re-test is impossible".  So yep, nothing much else today...

      Yes, read the title above...  That is exactly wat kim just called me...  So yes, for all of u who know, u know wat today's song of the tidings of misfortune is gonna be about...for those who dont, close your eyes and get lost, ya bother me!  So yea, the twins are back from bintan, and i just realised my major screw-up...and yes, apparently i made nic cry in the process...  Well, great, now ive got just about the WHOLE FUCKIN WORLD PISSED OFF AT ME! AINT IT GRAND? My god, somebody find me a fuckin wall...i need to bang my head...  Yes, i made a mistake once...that mistake was holding on to my feelings for kim for too long. Y cant i just forget about her, and move on? Y? Y? Y? Wes, thanx for knocking some sense into me man...  Pls kim, now even U think i like u for your looks? WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE GIRL! I know girls ten times prettier than u! If i had wanted looks, id have gone after em long ago...   Now, fine, u dont wanna talk to me, at least listen to wat happened...  Now, remember wat happened at tuition the other day? When  nic told me she had some "mean but essential letter" that she had to send me? Well, I thought that i knew wat it was about...and later found out i didnt...  Girl, u yourself bloody as hell know that i HATE seeing people angry.   U know y i gave u that blasting the other day? Lemme tell u why, if youre not happy about being suspected (if u ever will be), fine TAKE THE FUCKIN MATTER UP WITH ME, dont pin it all on your sis, and let her take the  crap for u!   And now, u know y your sis is cryin? Lemme tell ya why...  After i heard wat someone told me about your sis thinkin that i liked u for all the wrong reasons, ok, put yourself in my shoes here, would u feel so great that youd wanna have a party?   So fine, i made the mistake then, by sayin some stuff which i shouldnt...and ive apologised to your sis for that...  Following that, i thought about wat i thought were the words of your sis, and i realised one thing, she was just trying to protect u, so i realised my mistake back there and then, and apologised to her through an sms. It was after that, that i found out the 2 of u were in bintan...and yet, the next day, i stupidly sent another sms of apology to her...wat i didnt know at the time, was wat i heard was another side of the coin as the actual reason y your sis was pissed...  So yes, i explained it to her earlier in that phone call...and yes, im a fuckin bastard...  If u still dont believe me, ask your sis, and if after that, u still want to ignore me for the remainder of my time on this earth, fine by me...ill respect your decision

      The masses of people Trodding wearily... Into the light...  Their belongings emerge From a hidden dimension Delivered to them On a musty suspension  The little girl Stands behind the barriers of glass Seperatd from those she holds dear A tear breaks Rolling down her petite cheek  A courtroom of emotions A jury of silent witnesses In their hearts, they cry  In an instant The barriers are shattered The floodgates are opened  Reunion
