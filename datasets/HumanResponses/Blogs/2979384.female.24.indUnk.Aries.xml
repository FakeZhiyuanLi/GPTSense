         1985    I could vaguely remember that I had already started immersing myself into my siblings’ texts when I was no more than 5 years old. My bro was in P1 then, and my sis, P3. We stayed in a diminutive 3-room flat in Clementi for a while. That was a rented place, as my parents couldn’t even afford any proper dwelling for the family. There were already rules on subletting an entire flat back then, so whenever there were visitors, my parents would freak out. I never understood all this till I learnt about the HDB rules and policies just recently.  Anyway, back to the part where I was reading at least 2 to 4 years ahead of my age. My parents were always so proud of me, especially my mum, who probably thought I was a child prodigy. My dad adored me too; he always commented on my long feet. Well, they all thought that long feet guaranteed me to grow up real tall. But heck! I’m still short, at 1.58m. And I doubt I can grow any much taller. But at least I’m qualified to be an air-stewardess. Hur hur.  Somehow, we shifted to Bukit Panjang not long after. It was a small flat as well, but cosy. Perhaps it was the compactness of the accommodation that brought the family closer together. We weren’t that close-knitted, but we shared everything together. The bed in the one and only room; the TV; the kitchen. Imagine five people in the same arena and you’d know what I mean. Probably we were being compelled by the environment to share the stuff, but I felt happy. Not all the time, but the bulk of it. There was only once when I cried so hard and dashed to the room, drenching the pillow with my never-ending tears. My sis was there too, but she largely ignored me. Can’t blame her; she’s 4 yrs my senior after all, and obviously thought I was being juvenile.   I studied in a kindergarten in the same neighbourhood when I finally reached 5. I wasn’t intrigued by the syllabus being taught at all. I had started to read up to P3 stuff already, remember? I only enjoyed drawing classes, though I wasn’t that talented in art. Unlike my sis. She could draw anime real well. In fact, I think she got into some drawing competition before. Sud sud! My mum believed that she was pretty good too, and wanted her to advance her skills. So there was once when she persuaded my dad to drive around Bukit Timah area, cos she was informed by some auntie that there was a well-known artist living there. Somewhere. We went round in circles umpteen times, and finally chanced upon this dark, dilapidated “hut” that looked like what an artist would stay in. Poor artists. They never earn much until they pass on, do they?   I can’t remember whether my sis did take up the art class or not. My memory around that period of time died, probably due to the fact that I was trying to keep up in class. I felt that I was jinxed. Cursed. Cos I always came in position number 8, no matter how hard I studied. All the way till P1 or P2. Anyway, I didn’t even want to study 2 yrs in kindergarten then. I vaguely recall telling my mum that I would study only one year in kindergarten. Guess I was too dumb to understand things called “semester” huh. Halfway through kindergarten, I switched schools, cos my dad finally bought a place to stay in for us, in Woodlands New Town. That was in 1986.     1986    Yup, we moved in to our new place in 1986. It was a 5-room flat. Finally, we needn’t share room nor sleep in the kitchen anymore. My parents occupied one room; my sis and me another one; and my bro all by himself. What to do? He was the only boy. Anyway, my dad was so excited when we first moved in. He was, in fact, beaming with joy. And that was RARE. He proudly showed to us the picture of the phoenixes on the wall of the main living room. And the design of a beach on the wall in my balcony. He even told us then, that fish would jump out of the sea if we stared at it hard enough. And we actually believed him.  The kindergarten that I got into was at Blk 101. Which is very near the stadium. I had my first “bf” in K2. Well, we never kissed or anything like that. On the very first day I met him, he actually broke all his crayons into half, so that he could share with me. I was so touched! Moreover, he was such a popular bloke in school then. Somehow, we distanced apart gradually. I think the rest of the gals didn’t like me back then. Cos he was so cute, and I wasn’t. So the kindergarten photo featured him in the centre with a really pretty gal called “Lin Xing Xing” and me, with a Malay gal called “Rubah”. I’m surprised that I still remember their names, but I didn’t remember his. Rubah became my P1 classmate anyway.  There was once when my teacher organised a field trip to… somewhere…. Okay, I don’t remember where… But it didn’t matter. But that Lin Xing Xing actually blatantly told cutie boy to stay away from me! I really hated her that time man. But she’s really a pretty and smart gal – someone whom I definitely can’t offend. Throughout the entire journey, she was yakking and yakking with the rest of the class whilst I was left all alone. How could anyone talk so much??? How much would a 6-yr-old know to be able to share with others??? Well, she’s smart anyway. She even came in 3rd. While I end up being number 8 again. You’re probably thinking, “Hey 8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture, so it’s not so bad!” But heck! I wanted to prove the gal wrong that I was smarter than her. Unfortunately, my art couldn’t make it.   Back to the trip... The bus driver (okay, VAN driver to be precise) dropped us all back at school. Everyone’s mummy or daddy was there, EXCEPT mine. Where was my mummy??? I thought that she was probably late, which was pretty rare too. My teacher didn’t feel safe for me to be alone, so she said she would stay by my side till my mum came. But when my mum didn’t come, she decided to take me home. Unfortunately, being a dumbo, I didn’t even know the directions back home. It was eventually that I remember the block number. So home sweet home! It turned out my mum had thought that the van driver would send me home directly. Oh well.  I became suicidal when I was very little. I suppose it was because I never understood why my parents were always fighting. Why do people need to scream at one another, pull their hair, punch each other in the noses? I hate nosebleeds! They’re so disgusting. The blood that drips outta the nose is usually gooey and it drips non-stop. I also didn’t like to be forced to drink milk when I wasn’t hungry. But my mum didn’t know, and she slapped me for defying her orders once. For not drinking milk. Some mothers really should go for parental training huh. It’s not right to force your children to do stuff they don’t like. You instil hatred and suicidal thoughts into their young, innocent minds. And that’s cruel. Anyway, the episode ended with my dad hitting me hard on the head with a pole (or “tek-koh”). Not a good ending huh. Such is life man. I think my mum felt guilty, or at least she looked guilty.      Primary School Days    In 1987, I was enrolled into the school, which my siblings got in. Fuchun Primary School. The uniform was grey checked, with separate tops and bottoms. The best was that we didn’t even need to tuck in our blouses. A great way to hide all my baby fat.  My form teacher, Miss Tan, selected me as assistant leader in P1. She became Mrs Tan soon after anyway. And I still wonder why she had picked me, instead of a more popular guy called Jason or something like that. I was sheepishly hiding behind the selected group leader then. At that point of time, I thought that I was lucky to be seated just opposite the group leader, cos when he was chosen, he had to stand up and coincidentally, he blocked me out of sight from Ms Tan. Ironically, Ms Tan chose me to be the assistant group leader. In my mind, I was thinking, “Assistants always kena all the shit right?!” Nevertheless, being AGL made me pretty popular. I was quite close to a number of gals, and we always played skipping rope in school. Somehow, I was promoted to GL very quickly. Don’t know why. Mebbi the GL transferred to another school or something.   Unfortunately, I got too naughty and played a prank on two Indian classmates on Aprils’ Fool in 1988. I had collaborated with a close friend then, and she had flatly denied all accusations by the Indian gals. But I couldn’t hold up the truth and confessed to Ms Tan, right in front of the class. Imagine the class’ look of horror when I ’fessed up? Ms Tan got real mad at me and made the both of us stand outside the class with my ears pulled. My friend cried her eyes out man. Made me feel damn guilty for blurting everything out.  My paternal grandfather passed on when I was about 8 yrs old. He was a very kind-hearted and soulful folk, whom I always loved though I didn’t manage to interact much with him. We are not related by blood at all, cos he had adopted my dad when he was about one yr old. His family lived in a kampong in Kranji. My siblings stayed there when they were small, but I didn’t cos my mum wanted me to stay away from mosquitoes, spiders, and the like. The whole place was destroyed by the govt shortly after his death, which was a pity. Cos it was real fun cycling down the steep slope. Oops. I know we shouldn’t play so much when we were staying there cos of his funeral. But we were kids, and what do kids know? Right?  We had streaming after P3. I was allocated to be in the best class, 4F. The school had this weird policy back then, that the worst class be 4A. Basically a reversal. Said it’s meant to boost the morale of students who didn’t perform as well. One of my good friends then got into 4A, and so we seldom talked anymore. But I remember asking her to write in my autograph book. It was popular to have autograph books then. I didn’t find it all that meaningful, cos it’s better to keep in contact rather than leave footprints, or in this case, pen and fingerprints, in pretty books that smell nice. Right? But I had one anyway, cos I was easily influenced by others. Bad trait. Ha-ha.  Anyway, I had this wonderfully smart teacher called Mr Wong from P4 to P6. He taught us everything other than Chinese. English, Math, Science, PE. Thus, it was hard not to be a good gal. Huh. He always picked on me to stand up and read Math sentences in class. Probably he couldn’t remember my name well and thus kept picking on me. I thought he hated me that time. Duh. Anyway, he was a really dedicated teacher who always made us do lots of Math questions, causing us to skip our lunch breaks. It was then that I developed gastritis for the very first time. I suppose Mr Wong is really a fanatic in Math. He even conducted gruelling detention classes after school for us. Then enrolled us in some Math competitions. There was one pretty prestigious competition that we went for, and we actually got in 10th place as a team! It was an achievement worth mentioning. After all, we had put in so much time and effort in training. I think I got 17th place as an individual. After a guy whom I always competed against in class in terms of Math results. There was once he scored full marks (Yes, 100%) while I got 99% cos of a silly mistake. I cried my heart out when I got home man. And my mum never understood why. Ha-ha. Well, it’s actually not a bad thing to pit oneself against some other nerdy bloke in school, cos it makes you work harder. In fact, I was awarded 1st in Math in P5 & P6. Yeah!  Oh yeah, one more thing, which I feel that I should add is that, I started menstruating at the ripe age of 11! And the magical date (I can never forget) is 18th June 1991. You might think that it’s pretty early for an almost bust-less gal like me. Hmm I also think so. Heck it! Why are my boobs so small even when I had my puberty so soon? Aren’t they supposed to start growing earlier, and subsequently bigger? Life is definitely NOT FAIR.    (To be continued....)    cheeriOz, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       I'm  home alone  today!! Well, at least for now lah. I just reported sick to work & my mum's gone to see the Chinese physician.  And I feel so so horrible now!!! My throat's killing me, my eyes keep tearing, and my body aches like hell!!! What's wrong with me huh? Why do I fall  sick  so easily, whenever I have to wake up early??? Yeah, I think I'm not fated to work; I'm fated to be a  tai-tai !!! Hahaha.... Or mebbi I'm not supposed to live in Singapore; the time zone sucks. And the working hours are long. And everything's  expensive  (or that I'm just too poor to afford anything).  Yeah, I wish I could afford a label. Best would be  Hermes  lah, but that's mission impossible right now. Mebbi I should just settle for  Fendi , it's not so exp right? MY sis got a smallish  Burberry  and it already cost $700+. Anyway, her bf paid for it, so it's not so bad lah. How come I dun have a bf who'd pay for me huh??  I was thinking about how to make  money  since yesterday. I still thought that becoming a tutor might be it. If I just  tutor  10 students and each student pays me $200 on average, I'd earn  $2K  every month. And each student takes up 2hrs every week (assuming that it's a Sec sch student). So I just need to work  4hrs  everyday, from Mon-Fri! Sat & Sun off!!! Sounds like a brilliant idea lehz. Better than  Samuel's  "BE A FINANCIAL CONSULTANT! YOU'D EARN $1.8K EASILY!" idea. After all, it's much easier, and I get weekends off. And I needn't wake up early on Thursdays if I plan my schedule properly. In that way, I can go  Ladies Night  every Wednesday. Yay!!! :)  Speaking of Ladies Night, 2 frens asked me whether I was partying laz night. And I got to know where they were going pretty late, ard 11+? One was going  Devils  as usual and the other reached  Zouk  just as I replied his SMS. Hmm last week was quite fun. Chiong'ed 4 plcs in all:  Mambo, DblO, MdmWong & Newsroom .  Awaiting the weekend to come!! Got it almost fully planned. Sat, Amazing Race @  Sentosa  &  O Bar  at night with Zen & Jensen; Sun,  KTV  (mebbi).  Mebbi I'd write more later. :)  cheeriOs, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       On my way home yesterday, I swore to myself that I'd undergo an absolute  detox  program, derived by MYSELF. Unfortunately, the weather was so cold and I had to walk a good whole 20mins just to get to the MRT station, and by the time I got home, I was dead hungry. Mum's cooking was the usual... What's more annoying is that I chomped on tidbits again! One pack of  Nachos BBQ . Luckily it was a small pack and not the extra large pack which I usually buy (well, how could I resist??? It cost only three bucks).  After work,  Apples  MSG me to find out where I was. I told her CTH, and she asked if I wanted to go for a movie wif her. I felt apologetic, but I had to refuse her, as my show is on this evening. At 9pm. There was no way I could catch a movie and still reach home on time to watch it. Sorry babe!  When I got home,  JC  called me. He said he was eating dinner at home, and could detour to my place if I wanted to meet up. But I simply couldn't miss my " Light Years ", for gawd's sake.  Willy Lau  appears on the bloody box only ONCE a week lehz. Moreover, I was dead tired after dinner.  As I logged on to ICQ, another fren asked me out again. I rejected him just as well. And after the show, ard 10+,  James  used  Jessica 's HP to call me, asking me to go down to  ACNA  pub. So late! Of cos I rejected him as well. Well, looks like most pp gather on Tue huh?  Later on,  Fergy  asked me to help him edit his  FYP , and I stupidly obliged. Spent an extra one hour editing 1.5 pages. Oh my gawd! Did his project mates take English in their academic years or not?!! I decided to make use of the time in office today to continue to editing & documentation, which I did!  Just sent the edited copy to him; haven't heard from him yet. That ungrateful ba*tard. OK, not really a ba*tard. But he really behaves like one sometimes. He's rude, uncouth, gangly. I wonder how he manages to look  JAP  after he graduated from HCJC. Hmm...   OK time to  KO . BYE!!!  cheeriOs, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       I've landed myself in a temporary assignment, in one of the International banks. I had expected myself to be piled with loads and loads of clerical work, but fortunately, I was asked by my sup to " feel free to surf the Internet ". She said that what the bosses don't like are staff reading magazines, newspapers and whatsoever peripherals, but they don't really restrict us from using the WWW. So I surfed myself crazy yesterday (Yup, today is only the  2nd day  of work). Even used  ICQlite  insanely (YES, with all the popups) until another staff walked over and asked me to stop it. I wasn't sure whether he was just plain envious of me ICQing whilst he was doing real work (or not?), or whether they really do check what we do. But then again, if it's against their policy to ICQ, why didn't they block the addy? Haha....  Anyway, when I started the comp this morn, I was horrified to see my personal folder being politely renamed "  Please delete  ". Though they didn't name it in CAPS, I thought they were going to fire me straightaway. Probably they didn't like temp staff working happily on resumes in their office. Or that temp staff actually put their own photos as wallpaper. Whatever. It was thereafter when I found out that there was an  audit  check conducted and all PCs were monitored. So it's not really abt me, temp staff or anything.  Somehow, my thoughts kept running back to the times when I was little. So, I decided to pen my own abridged  autobiography . It's only halfway done now. But I'd posted it up anyway ( in archive dated  01/01/1999 ), and when I get back, I'll try to fix some photos up too.  Cheerioz, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

OMG!! noe wat happened?? i had set a new AWAY status "wOrKinG" which auto sends a msg "if i dun reply, u shld noe why". the next thing i noe, my boss was asking my colleague whether i was ard... piangz~ super embarassing i muz say....  so so... we now come to the episode of me offending pp... the first one was a guy who had sent me numerous SMSes such as "the sun is scorching hot today, birds are chirping endlessly. may u haf a suffocating lunch, and starve during dinner today!" okie okie.... not exactly dis... mebbi more like "roses are red, violets are blue. ur boobs are cute, and so are u"... Zzz.... well, all in all, to me... all irritating SMSes... i had warned him not to send me any of such msgs anymore couple of mths back... and i kinda disappeared from ICQ for a while... so now, he suddenly MSG me... and i was sprouting my philosophy no. 2 in life to him... again... "dun send weird msgs to pp whom u dun really noe".... Zzz...  another offensive case.... happened when a guy merely called me "dear" in his instant msgs... i kinda told him off... saying that he had never even seen me b4... why is he calling me "dear"?? he retorted by saying that no matter how i look.. ugly or beautiful.. i am still his "dear" fren... and tt he will still call me "dear" no matter wat.... den he added... that mebbi i cld send him my pix... DUH!! anyway, i reiterated my philosophy no. 2 (phrased in another manner)...

       okiez, i admit... i am getting so fucking frustrated now that my mood just starts to nosedive at supersonic speed orediz... most of u muz be wondering wat exactly happened to e "always chirpy, always happy-go-lucky" karen lim huh.... so much wrath building up.... well, itz not juz ONE thing which cozed all dis.... but a string of events...  first things first... my family. everyone noes that i am trying to bear wif my mom's constant naggings abt food, food and more food!! doesnt she think of anything else??? why issit that my frenz' moms can go la kopi, shopping etc wif them.... even my colleagues... they can talk abt anything under e sun. okie okie... even if she doesnt wanna talk to me, dun need to keep shoving food into my mouth. i am not a crocodile. i dun eat anything that looks edible. infact, i was so irritated for e past one mth that i just stopped talking to her. she noes why, and yet she doesnt try to change at all. and she caused so much hatred btw me and my siblings too, but doesnt even bother to explain to them. wtf man. and my bro... he still walks away whenever i take a seat in the living room... its not tt i dun wanna watch tv.... but who wld still have the mood to do so if ur bro treats u liddat??? and i can't even touch anything that he bought.. for e.g., his icecream etc... and to think that i always share my snacks wif them.... asshole!!  work is basically still fine.... except that i feel bloody unappreciated... for e.g. i was asked to create a webbie for my coy... which i did... in fact, the bulk of it is oredi up.... all i needed was the content to beef up e skeleton.... but who noes... my lady boss eventually got a temp gal (someone who seems related to them) do do the webbie... oh well, if she had oredi wanted to get her to do it, why did she ask me to waste my time and effort initially?? and the gal actually dared to ask me for my opinion on her webbie!! esp after she had oredi seen my work b4.... what did she expect me to say??? the truth "OMG your webbie sucks!! super unprofessional man" or sweet talk "oh wow, your webbie is fantastic!! the best i'd ever seen in my quarter decade"??   most of u wld say that, in such bad times.... ur frens shld be ard to support u... but suay suay there are so many wars among my frens now....   for one, james is upset and jealous wif daniel for being too frenly wif his gf.... omg.... just for dis trivial thing.... he gives up his frenship wif denial??? all of us used to have so much fun together!!... at the beach.... ktv.... drinking sessions at acna etc.... i really miss the good old times!! but seems like nobody really cares!!... jess' life is so revolved ard james now... its so hard to get her out as well.... she's so poor thing oso.... look wat she says... "I mean this whole damn thing is rather unfair to me lor... Just being friendly to u guys are also like that... Do u guys know what tyoe of pressure i am in.... juggling at two sides.... Not just friendship ....Personnel , family...What the hell... Just over this type of issue.. shooting each other, and now what getting out of life ...what the hell/"   another one... a newly brewed one in fact... is btw KK & eugene... and the rest of the clique anyway.... apparently, KK is getting so infatuated wif vive that his moods are starting to change wif the winds of vive. whether she turns up or not, whether she calls him anot... etc etc... all dis is pissing eugene off.... and as an old fren... i can't bear to see such things happen.... haiz.... and bcos kk is so obsessed wif her, he's  started to leave me (and chenzhi/eugene) out for certain gatherings oredi.... mebbi im too different from him so i cannot really take it la... cos if its me, even if im attached... i wldnt just chuck my frens one side....  as for hyan & teddy.... i oredi sick & tired of trying to explain wat got into me when i suddenly exploded that fri nite (7th May 2004).... might as well do it here for all to read huh.... den i no need to talk abt it anymore.... hyan & i were supposed to go for dinner b4 chionging.... den ended up she decided to call off dinner & said she wld still meet me for clubbing session... turns out tt she had gone for dinner wif vive & teddy.... and i really wonder... since i noe all of them.... why wasn't i included in the dinner huh??? and i dunwan frens who just ctc me when they wanna go clubbing.... where's the bloody sincerity??? pardon me for being frank... but if im not welcome, den forget it... u will see me disappear... and i dun need to vie wif other pp for attention....    fucking pissed off, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       i am just a sparetyre. maybe i am just a natural born sparetyre. its the same at home, same at work, same even among frens.    i hate those guys who come after me just bcos they can't be wif the love of their lives, or just bcos they got some probs wif their gfs. and those fucking bitches who speak ill of me juz bcos they r jealous of me. those scheming bastards and bitches. i hate being coerced to do wat i do not like to do, and then get penalised for it. i hate to have my work being thrown away w/o rhyme nor reason. noone cares. noone appreciates.  i wanna die. i wanna travel to somewhere, spend all my money and die anonymously.  life sucks. love is dead.  cheeriOs, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       I'm having the Monday blues! Couldn't sleep last nite, so ended up wif only 3hours of rest. I wonder why I am so bothered by insignificant people around me. People who put aeroplane on me for other people. People who doesn't care about my entire wellbeing except for food. People who seem to only be interested in having sex wif me. What's up wif the bloody world today?? I hate them all. But I can't show the least bit of signs. Fuck it! I need a break!  I have yet to call back Aspial. I wonder whether they would call me before I do? Cos afterall, how much can they counteroffer? In terms of prospects and location, I would still very much prefer my current job. But it's still worth considering, especially when they sincere enuff to call me up to rejoin them. They are so nice! And I feel so honoured.  I am starting to wonder how much friendship actually weighs. Some frens seem so real, so genuine, so sincere at certain times. But they can just disappear within split seconds the next moment. Why? Could BGR be the cause of it? Probably this has been the norm all the while, but I never realised it. Being single for almost a full year, who can blame me?   I feel so envious of those happy couples. But relationships may not be everlasting, right? Aren't we all sick of breakups? I am the best example. I am the no. 1 heartbreaker. I fear vulnerability. I fear rejection. I fear monotony. I am no. 1 cowardess of the year. And I always fall for bastards. Darn! I need a superhero soon.  (wake me up. wake me up inside.  i can't wake up.  wake me up inside.  save me.  call my name and save me from the dark.  wake me up.  bid my blood to run.  i can't wake up.  before i come undone.  save me.  save me from the nothing i've become.)  cheeriOs, pRin~  cOmments? eMail me~

       i know dis is a bit late but... who watched TOP FUN on monday??? for those who were out there patoh-ing & missed e show... guess wat u missed??      JOLIN TSAI     yea... she popped outta nowhere halfway thru e show (after a series of dreaded tvcoms) & was practically gnawing on her mike singing dis song called "Dao Dai"... think its supposed to be a very popular song la... though i never heard b4... until tdy... okok out of topic!! anyway, e issue we have here is, thru'out e performance, she was holding e mike so close to her mouth, it was as if she were eating e mike up. (yea yea pls dun tell me they dipped e mike in chocolate sauce & tt's why she's licking e mike as she was singing... its too convenient for me to be convinced)... and her stage performance (or wat we call "tai feng") was so ungraceful... so jialat... so... unlike jolin. at first i thot it was someone else trying to imitate jolin (cos the show is abt real pp imitating artistes singing... and they have lookalikes at times too)... but turns out tt she's e real jolin....!!! *gasps*  after e song ended, there wasn't any *real* interview carried out. e next scene we see is jolin seated at e "judges panel" & they juz asked her a few qns. again, she kept holding e mike to her mouth. when one of e emcees, jack neo, asked her fans what they'd wanna address her as, they said "Princess"... e emcee seemed kinda reluctant to call her by tt name leh... hehehe... whenever they shoot her full face, it was always from a far angle... and when e show came to an end, all e artistes gathered in e centre of e stage... and practically everyone ignored her... except sharon aw, who tried to smile at her after shaking hands w everyone else... i guess nothing beats seeing e real thing huh???  oh yea... jus wanna add one more thing... watched a local sitcom last evening too... (yea yea been watching tv @ home... no life?? that's real life la...) e one starring jamie yeo, carrie chong & vernetta lopez... jus wanna comment tt jamie yeo is really babelicious!! so slim & pretty... woo... here's a pix for eye-candy purposes... (courtesy of mediacorp radio webbie) :p~~~     one last thing b4 i sign off for tdy... james lye & diana ser are officially married... dun cry... all those who drool over james lye (i still dun think he's tt handsome!!) all pix courtesy of mediacorp webbie...    awww so sweet....    shrek & princess fiona came by to say hello...    another lovely couple in love...  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       juz dis morn i thot of killing dis blog forever... and now, i'm posting yet another entry... how lame.... hahaha... "ok... NOT farnee"... (WHOSE PHRASE IS THAT???)  anyway, i came to work wif a terrible sore throat and extreme giddyness tdy. it must be due to the fact tt i slept quite late last nite... ard 1am... waiting in vain for a reply from someone whom i treasure a lot... apparently, he has decided to ignore me...  nearly wanted to skip work tdy... deliberately lay in bed till 7am... (my recurrent alarm wakes me up faithfully at 6.45am every weekday morning)... ironically, i wasn't late... but in fact, early for work... still thinking whether i should reset my alarm to 7am instead... u noe... when u r tired, every min is precious as hell.  i decided to dress more casually tdy, so i pulled out my white tee and beige pants (in case u guys didnt noe, i usu wear skirts to work... cos i look nicer in skirts lor)... well, HUGE mistake!! havent worn the pants in wks... and didnt realise tt e zip was beginning to become faulty. (i juz thot it was a lil too stiff to tug at dis morn)... rite now, i can't even zip it up properly. even if i do, it would open up eventually. and it would be difficult to zip it downwards, meaning gg to toilet wld be a torture too, if i can't even get my pants off!! so.... wat the hell... dun zip lor... juz hook can liaoz... but HENGZ!! i brought along my esprit sweater... very old piece of clothing but its damn long (think size M or L la)... can cover the entire zip juz nice... heehee...  dunno suay or heng, my boss decided tt we shld have a company lunch tdy... and it was so darn difficult to reject... and i can't possibly wear my sweater to lunch cos tdy is damn hot... in e end, i ate so much till i was bloated, and e zip popped up... so stressed man... kept using my wallet to cover when we walked back to office... and bosses kept talking to me on e way back... really sweat man...  moral of the story??? always wear something u look ugly in or something which has zips which might spoil... so that u wun be able to go out after work... WHY??? can save money ma... :p  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       over e past few days, i've been contemplating discontinuing dis blog. well, there are a number of reasons for that:  1) there is a limit to how much truth i can display here on e WWW due to privacy issues. i still feel stifled (wanna say but cannot say la).  2) i might be inviting too much controversy by broadcasting certain facts/events over e net. oh well, its not gd to offend some pp.  3) some pp say tt im trying to gain sympathy from my frens whenever i write abt how sad/depressed i was. but aren't blogs supposed to be an outlet for us to vent all our frustrations/misery?  4) many of my frens have oredi started writing their own blogs as well, and they prove to be more interesting than mine. for e.g., sexual content. ahem.  hmmm... what do u guys think??  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       A mother passing by her daughter's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then she saw an envelope propped up prominently on the center of the bed. It was addressed, "Mom."  With the worst premonition, she opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:  Dear Mom,  It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new boyfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Dad and you. I've been finding real passion with John and he is so nice-even with all his piercings, tattoos, beard, and his motorcycle clothes. But it's not only the passion mom, I'm pregnant and John said that we will be very happy. He already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. He wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too. John taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with his friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.  In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so John can get better; he sure deserves it!!  Don't worry Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Some day I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.  Your daughter, Judith    PS: Mom, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbor's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk center drawer. I love you! Call when it is safe for me to come home.    uRs tRuLy, pRin~

If I have the gift of prophecy  and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,  and if I have a faith that can move mountains,  but have not love, I am nothing  If I give all I possess to the poor  and surrender my body to the flames,  but have not love, I gain nothing  Love is patient, Love is kind  It does not envy, it does not boast,  It is not proud  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking,  It is not easily angered, It keeps no record of wrongs  Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with truth  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres  Love never fails  And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love  But the greatest of these is love   hmm.... looks familiar?? haha okay okay i 'fess up!! copied dis from Paul Corinthians 13... well... love is such a wonderful thing rite??? yup... to all couples out there... may the love of your life be in your heart n soul always....

       im so touched tt so many of my frds show so much care n concern for me when i was in one of the bleakest time of my life. i have finally understood the meaning of living life as it is. well, wasn't it supposed to be my philosophy?  "work like you dun need the money; dance like nobody's looking; live like there is no tomorrow"  sometimes we dwell too much on the sadness that the past has brought to us; sometimes we worry too much abt the future till we get all jittery abt e present; sometimes we just take things too seriously till we misjudge and hurt our loved ones. humanity is abt mercy, love, sensitivity, patience, contentedness, peace, understanding, loyalty... the list would never end. that's the way it is. life is complicated. if you ever try to understand it thoroughly, you become fatalistic. you might even become numb. just remember, sometimes, there is no good reason to why we do certain things. and noone will ever understand another being 100%. why do we try so hard to change someone, only to fail?   so why dun we just smile more and watch the world like its a beautiful movie? here's a gd example of a great smile...      how lovely!  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       it has been a tiring weekend. i was supposed to turn up for teddy's debut performance at muchuan but ray didn't wanna go. after all, we hadn't been blading for weeks already. ultimately, we went to ecp and bladed for an hour. i had a really bad fall on my left butt. think it hit my butt bone, tt's why. we went to a cafe for some pseudo pizza instead of macs cos i thot it wld be nice to have a change sometimes. e guy recommended turkish delight. however, there was only ham, cheese and egg in it. i asked e guy where the turkey was, and he sheepishly said tt there's no turkey, and tt it's called turkish delight cos the chef was turkish. DUH! tried to squeeze some discount outta him (e plc was practically empty anyway) but only managed to get a 10cent discount, cos i didnt have enuff change. hahaha.  after e blading session, i was supposed to meet up wif jc, estell n eric for dinner @ sakae heeren. due to miscommunication, i only had dinner wif jc. he said tt sakae was very hot due to air-con failure, and so we hopped over to billy bombers. yup its a new branch @ heeren. the chocolate milk shake was yummy. however, the spicy buffalo wings did not live up to its name. jc took some beef/lamb combo meal thingie, i didnt take any maincourse cos i wasn't really hungry.    after dinner, we drove down to ecp to meet up wif estell and eric. they had prepared e food and drinks dis time round. mainly junk food (for junk addicts like me!!) and red wine (for alcoholics like... me again!!!). yup... i drank more than half the bottle... but its not v strong la, only abt 12% alcohol... but after a while, dozed off in the tent. jc dozed off as well. it was a beep tt woke us both up. an sms from raymie. and it was 5am by then! but estell n eric were still chatting at tt time. woah so powerful. haha. we left as soon as we woke up, and by the time i got home, it was ard 5.40am oredi. but didn't sleep rightaway after shower la, cos hair still wet ma. in e end, chatted till almost 7am den sleep. jc was trying to help me wif some probs wif my IE. apparently, some porno toolbar has found a home in my IE. come to think of it, i still haven't fixed it eh? :p  here are some pix taken on tt day...       jc wearing e shirt i got for his bday... nice?? heehee...    me & jc...    me & estell...    eric... jc's cousin... do they look alike?? ahem....  on sun, i woke up quite late. raymie must have been v disappointed tt i got so little time for him. he travelled all e way to wlds to find me. but i met him halfway thru the journey (not exactly halfway la, admiralty lor). den we went down to marina square for his boss' bday celebration. it's at dis ktv pub. quite a no. of his colleagues turned up. including karen, vincent (those 2 whom we had gone blading wif last time). the rest of his colleagues were basically nice folks. some of them look so shy, they dun even look like they're insurance agents. chatted up wif one of the guys' gf, a very sweet gal who is in a/c, juz like my sis. poor gal, still gotta do OT even when she's sick. one of the waitresses, Elle, really made my day too. she's very ON, very sexy, very sassy, very daring, very pretty... hehehe im US (ultra straight) la... oh yea, raymie's boss is not bad too... raymie said tt he got a bit drunk, but i dun really agree. cos wat he said does make some sense. he's very frenly, encouraging n a gd sport. even gave me e first slice of cake. mebbi i look too hungry?? haha... drank a lot as usual la...    dis is raymie putting on a funny face... taken during dinner... :O     me & raymie... taken b4 we went for e ktv session...  hmm... back to tdy... well, i didnt really go out for lunch... geraldiz made sushi ydy and he saved 2 rolls for me!! im so touched!! i think its always nice to appreciate wat others do for me. he even put a green tea teabag in for me. but he said it wasnt as nice as usual cos the rice was too hard. hengz im not a picky eater. but after lunch always v sleepy.... now keep dozing off wor...   think i drank too much oredi... forgot tt 2 of my colleagues on leave tdy... so tdy office damn empty... only lady boss and me ard now... and she just asked me to do some research... hmm... time to surf net lo....  ciao~  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       today, i feel so depressed. i didn't even bother putting on foundation, just loose powder. and i feel so cold, so i wore my high-neck pink dorothy perkins top. but the vibrance of the fuschia doesn't seem to be able to make things better though. i was horrified when i went to the loo and saw my reflection on the mirror. i looked ghostly. i looked sad. i looked bad.  i think wat brought me to dis state is first and foremost, lethargy. ever since sunday nite, i hadn't had a gd rest. that nite, was jc's bday. he told me that he didn't even get any sms from his gf wishing him happy bday. so he called her, so that she can wish him happy bday. but she didn't pick up the fone. we chatted a while more, den i finally told him, that i had gotten attached recently. he was kinda upset, and called me ard 2.30am. we chatted till 5am. e next morn, he told me tt he was gg for 2pm show - troy - wif his gf. ard 2.30pm, i sms him "is there noone else?". think he got a shock haha. cos he replied asking me where i was, and how i knew tt brad pitt juz said that. well, that was my fav scene in e entire movie. the killing was so swift, so cool, so right. anyway, jc said he had a shitty bday. he said he and his gf doesn't even behave like a couple. and his gf didn't even buy him any bday present. i feel so sad for him. i know he has put in a lot of effort into his rship, but his gf doesn't treat him as nice as i did (or so he claims).   i suppose that's the way i am, always putting my frds' interests ahead of my own. i'm sure geraldiz can vouch for me on that, cos i dashed down to meet him last fri when i thot sth bad happened to him!  i miss my dad so much. and linkin park is coming but i got no money to go watch them. and things are not smooth at work either. raymie doesn't really know why im depressed, but he treats me very well. always wanting to cheer me up, always sweet n loving, always wanting to bring me out. and jessmie is always there to hear me out, and give me advice. she's so funny, sometimes her crap makes me wanna die from laughing.   i must learn how to appreciate the beauty of life. now, where's my saviour?  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       1. Guys don't actually go after good-looking girls. They prefer neat and presentable girls. 2. Guys hate flirts. 3. A guy can like you for a minute, and then forget you afterwards. 4. When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means you're not thinking the way he is. 5. "Are you doing something?" or "Have you eaten already?" are the first usual questions a guy asks on the phone just to get out from stammering. 6. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about. 7. When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad characteristics  8. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile. 9. Guys will do anything just to get the girl's attention. 10. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend. 11. When guys want to meet your parents. Let them. 12. Guys want to tell you many things but they can't. And they sure have one habit to gain courage and spirit to tell you many things and it is drinking! 13. Guys cry!!! 14. Don't provoke the guy to heat up. Believe me. He will. 15. Guys can never dream and hope too much. 16. Guys usually try hard to get the girl who has dumped them,and this makes it harder for them to accept their defeat. 17. When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back. 18. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...nevermind! would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. 19. Guys go crazy when girls touch their hands. 20. Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like. 21. When a guy makes a prolonged "umm" or makes any excuses when you're asking him to do you a favor, he's actually saying that he doesn't like you and he can't lay down the card for you. 22. When a girl says "no", a guy hears it as "try again tomorrow." 23. You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets the message clearly. 24. Guys hate gays! 25. Guys love their moms. 26. A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a couple of roses. 27. A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this doesn't mean that the guy likes her. 28. You can never understand him unless you listen to him. 29. If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does. 30. Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the face of the earth faster than girls can. 31. Like Eve, girls are guys' weaknesses. 32. Guys are very open about themselves. 33. It's good to test a guy first before you believe him. But don't let him wait that long. 34. No guy is bad when he is courting. 35. Guys hate it when their clothes get dirty. Even a small dot. 36. Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not that much pretty. 37. Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend. 38. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice. 39. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you. 40. A guy finds ways to keep you off from linking with someone else. 41. Guys love girls with brains more than girls in miniskirts. 42. Guys try to find the stuffed toy a girl wants but would unluckily get the wrong one. 43. Guys virtually brag about anything. 44. Guys cannot keep secrets that girls tell them. 45. Guys think too much. 46. Guys' fantasies are unlimited. 47. Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight does! 48. Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become too possessive. So watch out girls!!! 49. When a girl makes the boy suffer during courtship, it would be hard for him to let go of that girl. 50. It's not easy for a guy to let go of his girlfriend after they broke up especially when they've been together for 3 years or more. 51. You have to tell a guy what you really want before getting involved with that guy. 52. A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be matured and grow up. 53. When an unlikable circumstance comes, guys blame themselves a lot more than girls do. They could even hurt themselves physically. 54. Guys have strong passion to change but have weak will power. 55. Guys are tigers in their peer groups but become tamed pussycats with their girlfriends. 56. When a guy pretends to be calm, check if he's sweating. You'll probably see that he is nervous. 57. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl. He really is. 58. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, Please come and listen to me" 59. Guys don't really have final decisions. 60. When a guy loves you, bring out the best in him. 61. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. 62. If a guy has been kept shut or silent, say something. 63. Guys believe that there's no such thing as love at first sight, but court the girls anyway and then realize at the end that he is wrong. 64. Guys like femininity not feebleness. 65. Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do. 66. A guy may instantly know if the girl likes him but can never be sure unless the girl tells him. 67. A guy would waste his time over video games and basketball, the way a girl would do over her romance novels and make-ups. 68. Guys love girls who can cook or bake. 69. Guys like girls who are like their moms. No kidding! 70. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes. 71. A guy's friend knows everything about him. Use this to your advantage. 72. Don't be a snob. Guys may easily give up on the first sign of rejection. 73. Don't be biased. Try loving a guy without prejudice and you'll be surprised. 74. Girls who bathe in their eau de perfumes do more repelling than attracting guys. 75. Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the topic is about girls. 76. Guys don't comprehend the statement "Get lost" too well. 77. Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions but still love them more. 78. When a guy gives a crooked or pretentious grin at your jokes, he finds them offending and he just tried to be polite. 79. Guys don't care about how shiny their shoes are unlike girls. 80. Guys tend to generalize about girls but once they get to know them, they'll realize they're wrong. 81. Any guy can handle his problems all by his own. He's just too stubborn to deal with it. 82. Guys find it so objectionable when a girl swears. 83. Guys' weakest point is at the knee. 84. When a problem arises, a guy usually keeps himself cool but is already thinking of a way out. 85. When a guy is conscious of his looks, it shows he is not good at fixing things. 86. When a guy looks at you, either he's amazed of you or he's criticizing you. 87. When you catch him cheating on you and he asks for a second chance, give it to him. But when you catch him again and he asks for another chance ignore him. 88. If a guy lets you go, he really loves you. 89. If you have a boyfriend, and your boy best friend always glances at you and it obviously shows that he is jealous whenever you're with your boyfriend, all I can say is your boy best friend loves you more than your boyfriend does. 90. Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience. 91. You can tell if a guy is really hurt or in pain when he cries in front of you! 92. If a guy suddenly asks you for a date, ask him first why. 93. When a guy says he can't sleep if he doesn't hear your voice even just for one night, hang up. He also tells that to another girl. He only flatters you and sometimes makes fun of you. 94. You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see him praying sometimes. 95. Guys seek for advice not from a guy but from a girl 96. Girls are allowed to touch boys' things. Not their hair! 97. If a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you. 98. Guys hate girls who overreact. 99. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships...                   uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       tdy, i nearly cldn't wake up at all. even wanted to call in sick. in e end, decided to drag myself outta bed. anyway, bosses not ard, how bad can things get huh? strangely, even my horoscope says dis:   "It may seem like neither side of the bed is the right side to wake up on today, dear Aries. The only solution you may be able to come up with is to just go back to dreamland if you can. If you can't, focus on your heart, because it is trying to tell you that it needs some attention. Emotions may be running high, so be careful of how you treat yourself and others."  yea i wish i cld go back to dreamland, & i'm not sure how to treat myself & others anymore. nothing seems to be rite. geraldiz was moody but i didnt noe how to cheer him up... even thot tt he mite be unhappy w me... haiz... i used to lurve wednesdays to bits!! cuz it's ladies' nite & i wld always be somewhere clubbing... but rite now... itz juz signifies midweek & tt i still gotta wait 2 more days for wkend to come. & when wkend comes, i always waste it away sleeping. & my room is still in a mess.     national day is cmg, but noone seems to bother abt putting up flagz... a woman's dotter waz murdered & she gets kicked in e chest & tumbles off stairs... dengue cases have surged up to 222 pp falling sick... more & more pp are into extra-marital affairs... even guys who have really (x5) caring gfs cheat... whats up wif e world tdy??   eurythmics where r u???

But you can't do  everything alone, and just depend on yourself, learn to open up and accept other opinions. Try to get along with different people.  TYPE B You are a more active person, drawing a clear line between happiness and unhappiness. You are more quick-tempered. If you encounter things you like, you will do it without second thought. But once you encounter things that you hate, you will wish to get out of it as soon as possible. As you are a person of your own views, the friends you tend to have will be of the same pattern. But once good friends, you will understand them a lot and go all the way to help then. Friends are very dependent on you. As you are too emotional, you may make a storm out of a teacup with your friends. You must learn to do things in order and not give up easily. You can try making friends with those you don't think you can get along with, don't  stick with the same category. This will make you more popular and charming.  TYPE C Gentle like a lamb. You have a high level of adaptance power, easy to get along with people. Very popular in social life but seems that no one will talk bad about you. You hate to have conflicts with people so you always try to adapt to everyone. You treat every person differently. To look at the bright side, you adapt easily. But to look at the dark side, you lack of character, although you are one big nice guy but you lack of charm. On the surface, you havr a lot of friends but once you have troubles, you lack of soulmates to help you around. You must try to express yourself more and be more decisive. In this way, you can understand yourself more.  TYPE D You are stubborn, like to go in circles and don't get to the point. Once you decide on something, no one can change your mind. You are a good leader in a group so you win a lot of trust from your friends. But as you are too persistant on your own thinking, you neglect other people's suggestions therefore you can easily make enemies. Although it is good to maintain your own character but it doesn't mean you totally ignore other people's thoughts and feelings. You will let people think you are hard to handle and you will lose friends gradually and may end up alone. You need to learn to accept other people's opinion. This will make your social circle bigger and you will understand yourself better.

       life is full of irony!  &nbsp;  i am currently working on my company's webbie. and i had used dreamweaver to set the layout initially. and wif e ready-made templates complete wif css stylesheets, it was as easy as weaving a dream indeed. and i thot it looked pretty professional. but my boss didn't seem to like it. "too bland", she said. and so i decided to create another webbie from scratch. only dis time round, i didn't use any webbie making software, just notepad. yup, writing raw html has its advantages - e codes r less messy &amp; u needn't crack ur mind trying to decode e original codes. e result? i preferred e dreamweaver version! hey its a professional software, give them some credit for it yea? heehee... but my boss &amp; 2 colleagues preferred e one i created... DUHz... cos i think tt one is DAMN UGLY lor... thot ot putting up some screenshots for u guys to vote... but... NAH... i ain't so thick skinned... hehe  &nbsp;  clemmie has just embarked on his new job in a bank... isn't tt cool? he's gonna be asst branch mngr at bt timah brch next time... i used to daydream tt i'd becm a branch manager myself... cuz it'd seem like i owned e entire bank... no?? haha and&nbsp;i juz like wearing uniforms... u needn't bother abt getting new office-wear or wat to wear on fridays (even though they say "casual", shorts &amp; slippers are still a no-no)...  &nbsp;  oh yea, clemmie was complaining to me abt his parents being naggy &amp; critical... and tt he was thinking of moving out... oh well, i've had tt thot even b4 i started my working life. tt was why i "camped" in PGP for 2 mths when i was in Uni&nbsp;2nd yr... come to think of it, i was really quite guai (as in gd gal, not weird hor) tt time... though i had all the freedom, i never even went clubbing once. but i didn't exactly put all my time to study oso la... supper reigned my life every weeknite then...  &nbsp;  coming back to moving out... tt is really a DREAM tt not even dreamweaver can weave for me... whenever i see how messy my mum makes my flat (she throws newspapers everywhere, never clears up e living room table, throws bits of toilet paper after using it, never folds e clothes properly etc...) and how she always spoils e electrical appliances (yea she spoilt e tv, ld player, washing machine... e list goes on)... and she likes to speak ill of me behind my back... and den speak ill of my siblings in front of me... causing much unnecessary disputes &amp; even hatred (yea my bro hates me... and my sis never talks to me&nbsp;whenever she is at home... in fact, noone speaks much to anyone else...&nbsp;REALLY)... and she always cooks&nbsp;too much... even when i told her tt i ain't gg home for dinner, she wld cook my&nbsp;share... and irregardless of wat time&nbsp;i reach home (ranging from 7pm to&nbsp;12am), she wld keep asking me whether i wanted to eat... sianz ah!! in fact, my life sux man... the desire to move out is damn strong la...  &nbsp;  but to analyse things from another angle... if i were to really move out, who wld do all my dishes? who wld wash &amp; iron my clothes? who wld cook for me? who wld change my bedsheet for me? who wld clear my rubbish bin for me? eh in case any of u think tt i'm too pampered for gawd's sake... my mum is a housewife la... she reads newspapers all day... but somehow she doesn't really seem to know what's gg on in e whole wide world (just like me.... YEAH!! haha)... i used to observe e way she reads e papers, and... oh man!! she squints her eyes at the local current affairs pages &amp; e obituary section... PIANGZ!! but i must admit la... i do feel pampered... i dun cut fruit at all... my mum does it for me... and she brings my dinner plate to me... and she washes up e plate after i finish my food... she said she wants me to have smooth &amp; delicate fingers ma... so sweet rite?? hehe  &nbsp;  ok back to work... another 1hr 20mins only... yeah~  &nbsp;  :: kimmie - in solitude ::

       When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them.  At that moment, you are in love.   Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone.  Then, you are in love.   Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to letyou know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call!  At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.  When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love.  When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone.  Then, you are in love.  You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction.  At that moment, you are in love.  While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind,  then u are in love with that person.     uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       The body part where you love to kiss most reflects your personality type!  Please choose the body part you love to kiss most: 1) Forehead  2) Eyes 3) Nose  4) Face 5) Ear  6) Lips 7) Neck   Forehead: You have a strong passion for life and at the same time a  peaceful nature. Though you are a forgiving person, you demand respect  from other people. Your talents are expressed well and you have  good interpersonal skills. As such, you have a fulfilling socail  life and you friends around you will find you to be gentle and understanding.  Eyes: You are die-hard Romeo who requires lots love and you can  sacrifice everything for love as well. You express your love in a wild  and passionate way. However, you are equally capable of becoming  a vicious lover, manipulating your partner to achieve certain  selfish goals.  Nose: In a relationship, sex is something essential to you! You  value friendship,loyalty and you have a strong desire for love and  sex. You are playful by nature and you cannot stay long at a place  without feeling uneasy. As a result, it is very difficult for you to establish a strong foundation for your career and it is  advisable that you do not change your job with no strong reasons.  Face: You value peace above all other things and friends are very important to you. You willingly share all your prized possessions with  them and you are not easily bothered if you are short-changed. Also,  you have a kind heart and you try not to harbor bad thoughts about  other people. Maintaining a long lasting and affectionate  relationship is your forte.  Ear: As a very understanding person, you can accurately guess what  is on a person's mind. You posses a disposition to appreciate or  share the feelings and thoughts of others. However, you can also be  someonewho cracks jokes at the expense of others and in wanting to  achieve your goals, you can easily sacrifice others. Towards  relationships, you are not affected by emotional constraints and is very  expressive. Your behavior is 100% congruent with your inner feelings.  Lips: You are someone who is governed by a great sense of loyalty.  When you kiss someone's lips, you are actually expressing the hope of  having one true love. Always radiating an aura of confidence, you  are someone with very strong moral codes.  Neck:  Flirtatious by nature, you are unlikely to be someone that  dreams of everlasting love. Although your passion for things is very  strong, it fades away in just a while. Even when you are no longer in  love with your partner, you selfishly demand him/her to love you still.  You are unlikely to have great ambitions towards your own life and  you are not particular about gender roles.  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       I came across dis  urlLink Astrology website  and dis is what they say of me... purposely highlighted those interesting stuff in bold... accurate?? :p  You are earthy,  sensual  and, secretly, a little  vain . Your "creature comforts" are important to you and you will always manage to be materially secure. You are very persevering (and sometimes very stubborn) and tend to form long-lasting relationships.  Those to whom you are close are endlessly fascinating in that you never feel you totally understand or possess them.  Sometimes this arouses possessiveness or jealousy but it certainly maintains your interest. They are deeply emotional, reserved and powerful.  You are attracted to intensely magnetic people who are extremely controlling and not always easy to understand.  You, yourself, are loving, sensual, somewhat stubborn and possessive and have strong security needs. You love strength but may resent dominance. Power struggles are not unusual in your relationships although they may take subtle forms such as obsession, jealousy or fears of abandonment. The emotional ties between you and your mate are deep and engulfing and require total trust on both sides.   When you love, you love passionately.  You surrender to your feelings and emerge from the experience feeling totally transformed.  Initially, you may seem almost aloof and impenetrable.  Possibly you are remembering past obsessions and are attempting to maintain a certain balance and peace of mind. If you succeed in this, the relationship never ignites or becomes important to you.  When you do cross the line and give yourself up to your feelings, you are utterly consumed by them.  Your one defense is a sometimes manipulative attempt at control. This works with varying degrees of success since, even if your partner does feel somewhat dominated by you, your dependence upon the situation is, in no way, lessened. This can lead to the agonies of jealousy and possessiveness. Your partners are frequently younger than you are and may be talented, attractive and oddly elusive in that they have strong intense emotions but they might not be overtly expressive or demonstrative.   Your parents' interests and emotional natures, while not in violent conflict, were so different it was  hard to understand how they ever came together . You associate close relationships with both longing and loneliness and may be unclear about roles.  Your love nature is very turbulent.  You form relationships impulsively and then worry it's with the wrong person.  There seems to be a dichotomy between the person you know yourself to be and the person you feel you should be in order to be valued and loved.  Power struggles plague your relationships. Either you become the dominant partner out of a  fear of being controlled  or you become  very passive , controlling indirectly through guilt or manipulation. Your father may have been emotionally abusive to you.  One of your great strengths is your sensitivity. You tune in easily to the psyches of other people and, while you may not notice the color of their eyes, have an almost  eerie understanding of their private inner worlds . Your close ties are very private.  You are assertive without being overly aggressive and usually go after what you want with confidence and enthusiasm.  You enjoy sex and your partners tend to be dynamic, successful people.  Your natural energy and moxie is usually sexually interesting to others.   You have a genial, pleasant quality which inspires confidence in others.  It sometimes surprises you the way people trust you with their innermost thoughts. Moral integrity is important to you and, while you are not judgmental, you will not violate a principle.   You tend to dramatize your emotional state.  When things are going pretty well, you're in ecstasy-and when things are not all they might be, it's the worst despair that ever struck mankind. People may find you a bit self-absorbed or inflated at times.  Your emotional life is turbulent.  Those who love you aren't always very nurturing and those who nurture you often don't truly understand you.  You are always involved in a close relationship, but it rarely has the emotional intimacy you privately long for.  You are extremely verbal and communicative and have no difficulty in making your thoughts and ideas clearly understood. At times, however, you may become a bit glib and use your "gift of gab" as a means of protecting yourself from emotional vulnerability.  You may be overly self-indulgent and inclined toward  excesses of eating, drinking, sex or anything which gives you pleasure . You would not be comfortable with someone who was too reserved. You can be quite extravagant both emotionally and financially.  You have a tremendous amount of energy and, in a relationship, are happiest when you and your partner are  actively participating in something together . You tend to be quite  competitive  and can even be somewhat  combative . You should always avoid the timid.  uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       got dis from an email fwded by geriz... interesting & meaningful stuff.... :)  Why hold someone back.. when you noe you don't luv them.. Why keep them to urself.. when you noe you won't wanna have them?  Why let them miss other chances.. when they can hav them? If you really don't love someone.. let them go…hurt them NOW.. not later.. for a longer relationship builds stronger emotions..  A good relationship isnt a game you play or an ego trip you take.  It is abt luv and 2 people.  Loving someone can give us the greatest joy we can ever know and it can hurt more than we can believe too.  When it does not really hurt when dat person did something disappointing to you, but really hurts when you see that person in pain and sadness, then you know you truly love that person.   Loving someone means you shld be ready toexperience heartache and happiness at the same  time. Dats the reward and dat's the risk. Unless we are willing to experience it, we will never really noe what its like to luv and be loved. Sharing luv is probably the most valuable and meaninful experience a person can ever hav. And there's a difference between bein in luv with someone and loving someone.    Its the difference between a luv dat's fickle, wild and short-lived and one dat's tender and passionate, nurturing and lasts a long time. The first is easy. The second, the one dat really matters to all of us, takes work bcos its abt keepin a relationship.   Luvin someone takes efforts. We have to be able to communicate wit each other. Nobody can read anyone else's mind. We always presume dat our partner noes wad we tink and feel. Maybe in time we might be able to predict or sense each other's thoughts but its never perfect and takes time to develop.    Gettin the chance to luv and be loved by someone is blessed. Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not wad you wan him/her to be. Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way. No one is perfect.    It is true luv which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth surface of acceptance for each other.  True luv sees and accepts a person for who he/she is. It is also true luv which makes a person change for the better.    The power of true luv to a person is undeniable. A relationship needs commitments too.  What is luv without commitments from each other anyway? It's like principles and values.   Everyone has them but they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them. The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we love.   "Luv is like an antique vase. Its hard to find, hard to net, but easy to break." Every day everywhere, people fall in love.. but juz how many of these relationships are self-sacrificing love, and not juz relationships which are formed only for the intense! feelin of fallin in love?    I noe hundreds of friends who say the magical words "I love you".. but more often than not, the truth is juz I am IN love with you.    There is a difference between being in love with someone and loving someone.    If a person says he/she is in love with you, he/she means dat he/she likes you for who  you are now and he/she fell in love with you bcos of the present you.    This kind of love is temporary and lasts only as long as the fairytale lasts. When fairy godmothercomes in at midnight to whirl us back to reality, we see the heartache of such a relationship.. where both were only IN luv with each other.    But if a person says he/she luvs you, he/she means dat he/she luvs you unconditionally  for who you are now, who you were in the past and who you might be in the future.    When he/she says he/she luvs you and really means it, you hav to ask urself if you love him/her too or if you're in love with the idea of bein in love.    It is very hard to see the difference through logical thinking. Let your heart guide you. May you be blessed on your soul-searchin journey for your soul mate.   ARE YOU RELI IN LOVE? ASK URSELF!  Is this true love? Do I really love him/her?  Or is it juz another infatuation?    ARE YOU willin to give? Even though you may not get back the same amount you gave?  ARE YOU cheatin urself?  Thinking dat you really love him/her and not juz takin him/her as a substitute for your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend?   Friends, let today be the day.. you truly understand love. If after readin this and answerin all the questions, you are very sure dat you luv him/her, tell him/her dat. Let him/her noe how much you luv him/her and dat you are willin to take the risks of being hurt by him/her in the course of the development of your relationship with him/her. This is a luv dats sacrificial, ARE YOU ready for it? If you accept someone's philosophy dat is simply their rationalisation to justify their failure, you accept their failures!   **The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.**  If you tink something will make you happy, go for it.    **Remember dat we pass this way only once.**   YoU cAn'T mAkE sOmEoNe LuV yOu, aLl YoU cAn Do Is Be SoMeOnE wHo CaN bE lOvEd, ThE rEsT iS uP tO tHe PeRsOn To ReAlIzE yOuR wOrTh~   uRs tRuLy, pRin~

       many of u must be wondering wat happened to kimmie's blog... as no new entries popped up day after day. i shall unravel dis mystery. i simply had nothing to write!!! to keep it alive, i decided to give a brief itinery of my mundane working life schedule.  0900 - reach office, surf net & msn 1100 - boss comes in, start working on reports 1200 - waits for boss to go for lunch 1300 - thinking whether i shld eat anot 1400 - decided to grab a bite & replenish refreshment 1500 - unpack refreshment 1600 - real work comes in (prepare contracts, surf for info as requested by boss, order stationery, eat biscuits) 1800 - KO (i.e. Knock Off)  anyway, i had wanted to skip lunch initially, cos i was getting really fat, and flabby, and weak. yea yea yea e usual complaints of women!! but in e end, i decided to try the sliced fish noodles stall which lloyd always makan at. sucks man!! no matter how hard to tried to psycho myself tt e bloody bowl of salt water disguising itself as milky soup is darn delicious, i can't help but wonder why i spent $3.80 on such bloody mirk. and there was dis guy who kept making fake coughing noises at the table beside me. he seemed to know that i am irritated and would stare at me and i wld stare back. in e end, he got up, raised BOTH his arms (as though in "sweet" surrender) and walked in a ya ya manner. apparently, tt bloody guy was trying to attract my attention. darn! shldn't have worn a low cut top... :p  after tt, i proceeded to carrefour to replenish the stock in my pantry. thot of getting root beer initially, den decided against it. ultimately bot green tea again. hmm green tea not bad ma. at least its from the shelf named "healthy beverages" lehz. and i just realised tt coke occupied one entire shelf. hmmm... anyone got any new biz ideas?? also, to prevent myself from munching on those evil fat-laden biscuits, i bot stuff which i dun like. let us pray tt kimmie slims down again yea??  im still thinking whether to go ladies nite anot... but dunno where i shld go lehz. even if i go, i dun have kaki. haiz... anyway, b4 i leave, here's an interesting article tt cot my attention while i was surfing tdy... titled  urlLink The Secret Lives of Wives . yea... dis is to make up for e lack of substance in my blog...

       回忆里想起模糊的小时候 云朵漂浮在蓝蓝的天空 那时候的你说 要和我手牵手 一起走到时间的尽头  从此以后我都不想抬头看 仿佛我的天空失去了颜色 从那一天起 我忘记了呼吸 眼泪啊永远不再 不再哭泣   我们的爱 过了就不再回来 直到现在 我还默默的等待 我们的爱 我明白 以变成你的负担  只是永远 我都放不开 最后的温暖 你给的温暖 不要再问你是否爱我 现在我想要自由的天空  远离开这被捆绑的世界 不再寂寞    uRs tRuLy, pRin~
