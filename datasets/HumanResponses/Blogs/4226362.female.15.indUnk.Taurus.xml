       hey everyone. Things have been crazy lately in my life and im just here to tell ya about some of them. Well im in syracuse at the oh so wonderful Marriot, waiting for pizza hut. mmm cant wait. I miss everyone so much in Lp, I really didn't want to leave. alright, well i havent talked to anyone except C and MZ about the other night. J seems to be missing , K and D did talk to him thoguh. Hopefully hes doing well. ( i miss ya so much J it would be nice to talk to you soon). MT was so fucking pissed about what happened. He came overthe next day and was so worried i thought he might just have a heart attack. But we both talked it over and i think we're all good now. Yah, so for those of you who are totally clueless about what im talking about, lets just say that Im not planning on sneaking out of the house, getting drunk and getting caught by the cops again anytime soon :(. But ya know what? before any of this happened MZ and i were talking and we decided that if we did get caught, that it would be worth it, and ya know what? it totally fucking was :) . oh yeah , this whole thing with MZ and MT. MT being my boyfriend, wasnt too happy with MZ. the next morning, he went to MZ's house , attempting to "beat the crap out of him". Well thank god he wasnt home. the way i see it, bloodshed is never a good thing.    So yeah, my last memories of lake placid are sure going to stick with me for a while. yesterday i spent the day with my good friend B from Watertown. and today went to denny's with the rents. ooo fun fun. Alright well im off to eat some pizza. I just want to say i miss everyone so fucking much and i love everyone . hopefully MT, J, D, and JB will be able to come down to Daytona next April. Atleast i have tat to look forward to. I also hope everything works out with what happened last tuesday. but what can i say? It was worth It.
