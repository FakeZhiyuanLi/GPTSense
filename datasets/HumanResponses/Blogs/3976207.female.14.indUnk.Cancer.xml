       I loved you once I loved you twiceBut you just weren't very niceSo i moved on with some fear And all i got was just a tearBut you taught me one thing i'll always enhanceThat sometime's life only gives you one chance So take that courage when it does Take it and don't be like i wasCause now i want you back But I really don't see that!    *~*From a distance*~* From a distance I watch him And there is no controling his mind or his heart For i am just watching with a smile so grim It is ripping me apart I cannot change him He loves her and thats the way it has to be Because I am afraid he does not love meAnd its sad to say That he feels this way!    ---Playa--- I sit here and wonder if your really into meOr if you just like what you see Im not a stupid gurl So don't play me for a foolIf you think im just along for the ride Im not into that game Im really beginning to like what i see in youIm hoping maybe you like me too    *..:Blind:..*..How can I be so blind....To think that you made up your mind....Why am I so unconscious....To think to you, I'm so lucious....Am I that mislead....To think you actually meant what you said....How did I get myself into this mess....I thought it would be for the best....My point is... You don't realize how deep you get....Until you regret the day you met..    *I wonder what I see in you* *Then I look* *And I know to love you, your more than just a clue**I look in your eyes**And I know you'll tell me no lies* *Then I looked at you in a differant view* *Thats when I saw the real you*    I Always Imagine Your Gentle TouchIf Only You Knew I Felt This MuchNot Being With You I'm Falling Apart Cuz I Don't Know How To Get To Your HeartIf You Could Only See The Luv In My EyesOf All Those Nights I Sat And CriedJust Look At Me I'm Standing HereJust Call Out My Name And I'll Be ThereHow Long The Wait, I Don't Know When That Day Comes I'll Let It ShowIf Only You Knew My Feelings For YouI'll Stay Hopeful You'll Feel The Same Way Too  I always thought U+Me=Never,You made me believe me it meant forever, When you said that, I believed it was true,Even my friends believed i wuz the one for you.*I felt I'd known you all my life Even thought I'd only known you a year. When you dumped me, I felt like my heart had been cut w/a knife, That day wuz the day I saw you smear. *For weeks I cried, And for weeks I tried, For weeks all i did was long... Then I realized, from the beginning, I was rite, and u were wrong.    -Friends-Written with a pen, sealed with a kiss, If you are my friend, please answer me this: Are we friends, or are we not? You told me once, but I forgot. So tell me now, and tell me true, So I can say "I'm here for you." Of all the friends I've ever met, You're the one I won't forget. And if I die before you do, I'll go to Heaven and wait for you, I'll give the angels back their wingsAnd risk the loss of everything.There isn't a thing I wouldn't do, To have a friend just like you!    Sometimes I remember When we were togetherEverything was perfect In each and every way You loved me forever, and more each dayI should have known It was too good to be trueI held my head high And tried and tried, to say goodbyeI thought about our memories And all the good times The times I had you So tight in my arms And knew that it was true That I'd love you forever and that's what I'll do   -I 'll be fine- i'll be fine w/o ui won't even cry even though i know "i love you" was a lieso go on with ur life and i'll go on with minegetting pass the knowledgeall u did was lie i'm willing to be friends but it will take time untill than....good-bye!   i should have thought fasteri didnt have a cluei was irrational and what not but i should have came to you the sad thing is, you came backtrying to bring me home ur eyes were filled with so many tearsoh...now i feel so alone why couldn't i look past the void that kept us far aparti couldn't find a way to forgive you because u had broken my heartand now it's all so different we both changed a lotu moved on and found a girl it's like you just forgotwhile im slowly punishing myselffor not figuring out whyand im completely lost and so confusedbecause i CANT say good bye    &nbsp;  I hOpE YoU ALl hAvE a grEaT suMmEr AlThOuGh ITs CoMinG TO an eNd neXt YeAr Is sOoOo gOnNa kIcK AsS!!!!ChS bABy!!!!
