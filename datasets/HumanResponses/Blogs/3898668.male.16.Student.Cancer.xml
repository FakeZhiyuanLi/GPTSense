      The words that have been drained from this pencil, Sweet words that i want 2 give u  And I can’t sleep  I need 2 tell u  Good night  When were 2gether I feel perfect  When I’m pulled away from u i fall apart All u say is sacred 2 me  Your eyes are so blue I can’t look away As we lay is stillness u whisper 2 me   Baby, marry me, promise ya'll stay with me  No you don’t have 2 ask me, u no you’re all that I live for  You no I’d die 2 just 2 hold u,  Stay with u  Some how ill show u  That are me night sky  I’ve always been rite b-hind you  Now ill always b-side you  (Musical interlude)  So many nights I’ve cried my self 2 sleep  Now that u love me, I love me self  I never thought I would say this, I never thought there'd b you.

      like i sed in the first post, im using this for a place 2 wirte down my feelings, but im sometimes i get so afraid im of releasing my emotions that i cud hurt either freinds or family, i no what i need but i just cant seem 2 find it, and that is a release...., just sumthing 2 take everything out on, now im not askin for ya sympathy, but ive had alot of shit ova the years about me being well gay and fat, but the thing is im not at all bothered what ppl say and my freinds dnt mean i no they dnt, its just they do it for so long that it just kinda builds up, n dnt get me rong just cause im gay dnt mean im a complete priss, cause im not ya average 'gay', im more 'str8' than i am 'gay', but with everythin just building up, i can feel it just teetering away just under the surface and if i dnt keep my cool and i let slip for one sec and snap just like that, i can feel it, ive had anger managemeant b4 n it didnt work this 'rage' just keeps cumin bk, but with my close freinds, startin 2 realise this, they stop ripping me cause they no what its doin 2 me, im so afraid though its just wont go away.
