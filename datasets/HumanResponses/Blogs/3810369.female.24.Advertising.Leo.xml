         This has been a profoundly known phrase. The art of letting go...      I don't really think of what does this mean until I came to a point of being into  "that"  situation.

						   You name me Who am I That I should company with something so divine? Mercy waits, Overjoyed Prospect of finding, freeing Freeing me  [Chorus:]  Love is the thing this time I'm sure And I couldn't need you more now The way that you saw things were so pure Overjoyed  You name me Entertain Thoughts of peace can overcome anything Mirror spins Wicked tales Here lies reflections of Deceptions of  [Chorus]  Missing the me from you you gave to me I don't like the one I have created today Crossing nameless from the one I've earned To be the one, the one you gave to me  You name me Name Me Finding, freeing me  [Chorus x 2]  Overjoyed, Overjoyed  (by Jars of Clay)

						   Collapsing was much softer Still falling always hurt Only after sensing your love For always ever burned You justified my folly My affluent disguise Removed revealing nothing Yet nothing unforgiven lies Unforgiven lies  No one loves me like you No one loves me the way you do No one loves me like you No one loves me the way, the way that you do  To touch the rose unfearful Is to meet the thorn And pierce the heart's emotion And feel the emptiness no more Emptiness no more  Took some time to realize I've fallen   (by Jars of Clay)

						   Author: Indigo Girls Album title: Indigo Girls History of Us ------- -- -- I went all the way to Paris to forget your face Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed Statues of lovers every place I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love I walked through the ruins, icons of glory Smashed by the bombs from above Chorus: So we must love while these moments are still called today Take part in the pain of this passion play Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust Until time makes history of us. Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil There's just no medium for life In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth In a dusty cathedral the living God called And I prayed for my life here in earth Chorus There are mountains in Switzerland, brillian cold as they stand From my hotel room, watching the half-moon Bleeding its light like a lamb And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep And it dawns on me the time is upon me To return to the flock I must keep.

						    Dark clouds are comin' like an army Soon the sky will open up and disarm me You will go just like you've gone before One sad soldier off to war, enemies that only you can see.  Dishes stacked, the table cleared It's always like the scene of the last supper here You speak so cryptically that's not news to me The flood is here it will carry you And I've got work to do.  Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before Come back here and shut the door I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.   There is fire there is lust Some will trade it all for someone they could trust There's a bag of silver for a box of nails It's so simple the betrayal Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.  Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before Don't you recognize them anymore I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.   There's the given and the expected I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected Is this for better is this for worse You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.  I hear the owl in the night I realize that some things never are made right By some will we string together here Days to months and months to years What if everything we have adds up to nothing.  Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before Come back here and shut the door I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.

						   A hard knock A cold clock Ticking off my time A long look But no luck Couldn't seem to find Or unwind Into peace of mind While I was trying  A quick glance A big chance My heart beat like a drum I saw you And I knew Chances just don't come Round again Not like this First a laugh Then a kiss  And I'm free in you I've got no worries on my mind I know what to do That's to treat you right And love you kind Thank you ever on my mind Love is just like breathing When it's true And I'm free in you  The lost time And self pride Are my big mistakes A clear voice A bad choice Sounding like an ache In my day Not too bad But too real To go away   But now I'm free in you I've got no worries on my mind I know what to do That's to treat you right And love you kind Thank you ever on my mind Love is just like breathing When it's true And I'm free in you  And I don't know How you show Such gentle disregard For the ugly in me That I see That for so long I took so hard (I took so hard) And I truly believe (I truly believe) That you see the best in me (That you see the best in me) I'm in love We all love And that thought Sets me free  Free in you Got no worries on my mind I know what to do That's to treat you right And love you kind Thank you ever on my mind Love is just like breathing When it's true And I'm free in you Yes I'm free in you  (by Indigo Girls)

						   I don't know how i should start this, i'm not good in writing. I love art, reading, and i write things that i have done, planned to do in the future and my current affairs but i'm not profoundly good in writing.  Anyway, this past few weeks has been overwhelming for me. Especially with the matters of the heart. Sometimes, when we are in the so-called cloud nine of love, we thought that we could pass any obstacles because of our past experiences. We thought that what we learned in the past is enough for us to carry the new relationship we are in. But we never know, not until we are into another bizaare situation, that the new relationship could be another step for us to learn something. But the hardest part of it is the investment that you have shell out, the emotions or feelings, the trust and so on. Yet, at the end of everything, moving on will all start with acceptance. That is to accept what happened, what went wrong, what has to be corrected and not, and moving forward. (*sigh*) Yeah, it's hard to forget especially when you get intoxicated with the romantic influence of the other person you love. I've loved so many times, but what is love? It isn't just the feelings, it's not just the sexual attraction towards another person of the opposite sex, it's not just physical appreciation or admiration of someone's values and character. What does it really mean? How many times have I heard "I Love YOU" from my previous relationships and to tell the truth, there isn't a magical spell on it to turn the relationship smooth and foundationally strong. But the three words are still important for me. I regard them as special that I want to hear it from someone willing to commit those three words with me. And I guess my recent relationship isn't the one. I felt devastated, yet I was relieved after my personal realization..(Thanks to the help & support of my friends). Or perhaps we could still work out and be together (for I cannot say what will happen in the future), but this isn't the right time. I guess it's true, that the right love at a wrong time, is the wrong love. And if God will allow us to be together again, then it's up to time. Now i'm going to talk about time. Well after love, there goes the time. Time which holds everything in place, and no one can own time, but of course God alone. And as for me, I shall have to wait for time, for my time, for everytime, and everything i want at a perfect time. Time allows me to learn, to grow, to have patience, and to trust God above all.
