       Uhm,  whoa , I just read mi first post, I cannot believe thats what i have been feeling in the past, i know i was severeli suffering from depression a while back, I had to take pills, although, I dont even know who knew that... Well, Paul being on the fucking  list  dint help, I am just so glad I dont feel like that anymore... I am over pretti much everything that is on mi " list " is gone... I have realized that ever since I did get with Jeffie, things have been a lot better. But i dont want to reli on him. I dont trust guys for fuck... Like honestli, there is nothing like the pain of a broken heart, and i dont want to feel that pain again, If you know what i mean. Guys can kiss mi ass, when i think about it, why do i waste mi time on the opposite sex? What is the point on having a bf at this very point and time in mi life, is it helping me out any? Uhm, Well I like having bf's its nice to have someone you care for, but there is so much trust involved, i know that i have not been the most trustworthy person in the whole entire world, and i think that jeffie is trustworthy, i am just a jealous person, and that is mi nature although, it is a bad trait, i shall one dai get over it.. Even though i am saiing all these negative things about having a bf, i still love having jeff as mine, he makes me feel so good about miself, and he treats me so well... He is (as i have said before) like the sweetest guy i have ever met. But i think that i have realized, that he and i are a lot alike, i dont know if he notices, and i highli doubt that he does... But i am going to pai closer attention to that... I wonder what is going to happen when paul gets back? I am so going to cope just fine, I just dont know how awkward it is going to be, like if we are even going to be friends, honestli, i realli did love paul. i dont know how i did so fast, and i dont get attached to mi bf's (and the thing is that he wasnt even mi bf) i wonder if one dai jeff will be able to love me, or is that too much to be asking for. Love is such a serious word and at times it can be intimidating, but if used in the right situation, then it can be the most precious caring thing that anyone has ever been told. One dai i hope for someone to love me, and to care about me, and alwais be there for me. Even though i have jeff, i dont know what he is thinking, and i dont realli talk to him about that stuff, i mean we have been like going out for like 2 weeks, i know, i am not expecting anything of the sort from him, that would scare him awai, and to be honest, i think that it would be wierd, i just hope that one dai we can be something, something that is so special beyond belief... Right now we just started going out, of course it is going to be awesome at the beginning thats how it all the time, and then when you get into the relationship, you start bitching at one another, and then blah blah blah... haha naw thats not for me, i am going to do everthing to tri and make it so that doesnt happen... haha i am not the kind of gf that likes bitching and complaining, i like triing to make things worse, as far as i am concerned, i like being the wai i am as a gf, i am alwais triing to make whoever i am with feel special about themselves, and i love giving rather than recieving, i love to see jeff smile, it makes me happi... everything about him makes me happi, but when he laughs or smiles at me, everything goes wonderful for that one second, and then its over, and i cannot relive the situation onli because it is something you have to see, and be there for. i know that i am such a loser, what can i sai, thats me... But even sexualli, i like giving rather than recieving, personalli, i dont know why, i mean i dont mind either wais :P, but as i said, i love making the other person feel good, even if it is in a sexual wai, its all good... haha i dont know, im such a loser, i just hope jeff likes me as much as i like him, cause the experience with paul made me veri cautious, i am not sure about what anyone says anymore, it all could be one big lie. but naw i highli doubt it... I dont want to leave tomorrow, i am going to miss jeffie so much, i know i sound pathetic (again) but it is true, I hope that he misses me a lot too, i know that it is onli going to be one week, and when i come back it is going to be 3 weeks that i have been going out with jeff, haha it is getting longer by the dai, i want him to be mi longest relationship. that would be wicked, i know that his was 3 months with that christa chic, or however you spell her name. He went to go visit her, and then he thought that i would be jealous for it... well of course i was kind like... "uhhmmm..." like you know, okai, thats kinda wierd, but then i mean he is aloud to have friends that are gurls, even the ones that broke his heart when they went out with him... But aw well there is nothing to do with me there, so i am not going to worri... I dont think that i am aloud to worri, i see a lot of guys, and that is being equalli, you know... the same kinda, although i dont realli go out and visit mi ex bf's... but its all good, whatever cooks your banick... (thats so paul right now) Speaking of the devil, Jeffie just signed in, I tried talking to him earlier, and i think that his msn was fucked, i dont know, and as he would sai, i dont fuckin care... haha anyway, i am now talkin to him, haha about the fucking song that i love so FUCKING MUCH! Haha gotta love  TEN SPEED HERO , i love them soo much man... haha i dont know, i am such a fucking loser, i could sai it forever... haha oh well... I think that i will be going and i will blog later... i dont know if i will in the next passing week, since i will be gone, but i will recap, when i get back, it is going to be sooooo long, :)  CIAO FOR NOW PURPLE COWZ! Peace out...

      Sniff sniff, this song actualli makes me  cry , its so sad... I  hate  it, how sad it is rather... Stupid Early November, oh well its just a song right, or perhaps its  screaming  something to me, in its rather  soft  voice, and  beautiful  lyrics. Man, so have to stop listening to that song... Well anyway, here are the lyrics so you can know why i  cryed  :P...   Sunday Drive-The Early November    Lyrics...   And we wait above a road. We're turning to go home. And the silence from the side of the car tells me everything and how we are. 'Cause there's no more trying to make this so right, There's no more trying tonight. And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone. And I wonder if I'm alone in your head. I know something is wrong,  I just dont know what to do. You say it's only me and that I'm so perfect for you. I don't want to try no more, I &nbsp;dont want to make this right. I&nbsp;just want you to be true to me,  one time. And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone. And I wonder if I'm alone in your head. Twelve weeks gone by since I have saw you last. I'll give this one more try,  I'll give it all my best.And I'll ask  "What could you be doing that is so much fun without me by your side, without me by your side?" And I'll take a step back,  and I'll let you ahead. And I will take a step away  and see if you come back. Because there's no more trying  to make this so right, there's no more trying,  there's no more trying tonight. We will never be the same. We will never be the same until you're done.  Speaking of songs, I found another song, that reminds me of mi jeffie, its:   &nbsp;  Broken Spokes, Bloody Knees-(OF COURSE) Ten Speed Hero    &nbsp; Just because he alwais listens to them in the car, and i am absoluteli in love with them...   ALSO... PLEASE LET ME PASS SUMMER SCHOOL!!!!!!   good luck to me...    Mwahahaha, i will so pass that mutha fuckin course...   I am listening to ten speed hero now, and it is so making me think of Jeff, everything reminds me of him -_- i wonder if thats a bad thing? Haha aw well... I am going to go out for pizza soon, and have a couple smokes, nothing gets better than that shit man, eating pizza on a patio thing on church and main, smoking, and enjoiing the summer while its lasting, makes me feel like having an orgasm right now... haha... in like 10 mins man... so excited...  I miss you jeffie, *smiles* man, i shall shut up now, i am such a loser...  I DONT WANT TO LEAVE FOR A WEEK *sniff sniff* Aw well, what are you going to do? Uhmm...

        This is mi poem,    I love this poem, perhaps the most realistic   I have ever written...    Abandoned  Pressured by the indistinctive ideas put upon me Conquered by the words you speak Take advantage of my frailty Your recognition and dexterity I do not seek  For you driven me to these extremes To not live in fidelity when forsaken You cannot wake up it is not a dream For whom the blame be taken  The fraud of myself was to be believed The fake outset to what people saw It was quite easy to keep them deceived I kept them from seeing every single flaw  They did not see it, behind all their will Shouldn’t have been judgmental, and do not relent And as I swallowed the very last pill My love will always be unsent  Abandoned by this non-existent realm The pain I never could have deemed To discount the bliss is seldom To reality it should have seemed  The darkness of the night The loudness of the softest song The dimness of the light The remnants of this throe so long  This pitiful state of which we call sane The last resort to escape the truth that be All my beliefs have been slain With the exact same sword that had killed me  My blood has dripped through these sheets And stained my skin and stopped my breath I am left here where jealousy and agony meets I may be straggled if any harder you do press  A recognizable face yet to be looked upon You’re so pretty yet you are evil in every way Your blue eyes black hair and skin so fawn You killed me ever so slowly in the harshest kind of way  You have left me lifeless and yet so pale My heart still beats but the rest of me dead Left hidden still cannot see me in this veil My blood is still blue, killed to fast to turn to red  The angel from my dreams, thought I would be saved The thought of the evil, and would be soon through Took into a small dark room, and all the walls caved To you my heart and soul were true, but it didn’t matter you killed me too  I had died for a second when I saw what you did As I am lying down denying what I had seen 1000 hearts for you would not be my last bid Have you ever regretted the past, to see what you could have been?  Standing still yet still moving Its only because you are the breath of me If I am not good enough what is the point of proving To the only door that has never been opened I hand you the key  Are you sure you want to step into my world and see? If you open this door, you will never want to leave Can you feel the desire and the strength of me? Too many people cannot get out; through out the crowd you must weave  You require a death of a sin to be accepted Be evil and you will impress us To kill and to die is how we are to be percepted Soon the pain turns to pleasure and the pleasure turns to lust...   NEVER TAKE TOO MUCH ADVIL , Tyler :P I  love  the unknown...

       For some strange reason, this song sooo reminds me of jeffie... So I'm dedicating it to him, and I'll but the lyrics too... I am such a loser man... The song is...   A Decade Under The Influence- (Obviousli) Taking Back Sunday....   Lyrics are... (Why am i such a loser) :P  Well, that's more sweet, so delicate It used to be this dying breed Well I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about this I kept still until the long drive home You slept safe and close to the window... Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about... You used to say you'll have to go (I could go all night) Well say you'll have to go (I could go all...) To hell with you and all your friends To hell with you and all your friends, it's on Well thats more sure than porcelain You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck Well I've got a bad feeling about this (because of this) I've got a bad feeling about this... Anyone will do tonight Anyone will do tonight Close your eyes, just settle, settle Close your eyes, just settle, settle And so on and so on and on and on and on...  Now that I am talking about songs that remind me of Jeffie, I think this song does...   Paris In Flames-Thursday...  haha, man i need a life, i wont even put those lyrics up...   But aw well, This post was for jeffie, I'll make more later... If i feel like it...

      I just felt like saying, I  love  you...  I dont know who I  love ,  I feel loneli and neglected...  So I am offering jobs, if you  love   Please  love  me...   As I sit by myself,  I've come from so,  so far away.  In such little time,  I have gave,  My soul, my mind,  I've tried so hard to find.  Is this what I must do, to get by?  And I ask myself why?  Why don't you run,  why don't you call me,  I'll wait here.  I'll find my way,  or will you help me out this year?  Does she understand me?  Listen to what I say.  Turning her back, on my dreams.  Watching, waiting.  You turn your back.  I'll find my way home,  You turn your back.  Turn your back on my dream,  So strong, so weak,  we're stronger still.  Is this what I must do?   You are calm and reposed.  Let your beauty unfold.  Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones.  Spring keeps you ever close.  You are second hand smoke.  You are so fragile and thin.  Standing trial for your sins.  Holding onto yourself the best you can.  You are the smell before rain.  You are the blood in my veins.    Fuck ...

      From her astonishing face, to her bright brown eyes.. her wonderful shaped body, and beautiful brown hair... everything about her is nearli perfect, no ones perfect, but i would have to say she is the closest that i have ever met. Her personality glows like a flickering candle in the wind,&nbsp;when no ones knows their wai, they alwais know where to find it... because she is alwais there... Her smile is stunning, all eyes capture her splendor, as if to sai, such beauti has never lived... Nothing has possessed her to be anything but wonderful to people that she meets. And as for me, I must be the luckiest out of them all, for me to have such an astonishing friend, for me to have such a smart, breath takingly beautiful friend, for me to have anything of the sorts, I must have lucked out because she is the best thing i could have ever asked for. If i asked for more, I would have to reach for a star as bright and as beautiful as her, perhaps, this is seemingly impossible, and i congratulate anyone who succeeds for she is beyond belief, for she is shocking, and if anyone was to doubt, to hell with them, because the true meaning of best friend is the best 5 letter word ever invented, ever named, ever born. And she is more than the world could ask for, more than it could dream, because having something this close to perfect must be a fluke... But its not, it all comes with the true talents, that she has earned... All of her is the most amazing thing ever built, or perhaps known to man... All i know is that she is real, as real as can be, and no one can be better, even if they tried their hardest... I love you megan, with all mi heart, I hope you love me too... Because you mean so much, and if i lost you, i would be lost forever without your smile...  (haha i am so cheesy, I hope you like it, I almost ran out of adjectives)... *mwahs* *let me rest in pieces*

      Perhaps maybei, just maybei things are actualli going mi wai, well the wai that is the best for me...? whoa, thats so strange, but aw well... I am going out with Jeffie now, and I so couldnt be happier man, honestli, he means so much to me, and i hope that i never lose him anytime in the near future, he is such a sweetie, i could go on about him all dai, he is just like... super wicked, he is the best I could ask for, If i was to ask for ani better than that would be perfect, and as far as I know, no one is perfect, but he is pretti damn close, i just have a terrible habit, or maybei even just bad luck about mi bf's totalli not digging me anymore... like they just get... tired??? perhaps, but although i have the worst cheating past in the world, he dont have to worri about that because there is no one that i would even cheat on him with, and i dont want to cheat on him because right now he is like the best thing in mi life, and i dont want to lose that... i would never even dream about cheating on him... and plus, he is how i totalli got over paul, i dont even think of him anymore... thank god... like i cannot believe how long it took me to get over him, it was kind of insane, but no that it is over and done with, i dont have to think about it anymore, haha i so regret writing that last post, seeing as&nbsp;i made a  complete idiot of miself  and i know that if paul ever did sai that he changed his mind ( which he wouldnt) i dont even think i would consider it, right now i am with jeffie, and that is how it is going to be forever, haha well forever as long as i can make it... i just hope that he feels the same wai, thats all i could ask for... tonight i was ay his hockey game, it wasnt too bad, i like seeing him, i could devote all the time in the world for him, and thats the most meaningfulest thing that i could give him, just cause i love being in his company so much, and that everytime i see him smile, it makes me happi too, i dont like to see him unhappi AT ALL! Haha it so sux when he is sad, but i usualli try and cheer him up, although i dont know how much mi gai corny jokes help... but aw well, i just like everything about him, EVERYTHING straight from his eyes to his beautiful face, to his suprisingly nice looking feet :P and everyone knows how much&nbsp;i hate feet :) but i dont care, everything about jeff makes me happy, everything, i cant help but say it, i could repeat miself 1000 times, and it would still mean something, he is so wicked, the best bf i could ever ask for, and at first i had doubts, i realli did, honestli, i just thought of him, as the kewl friend that paul had, and nothing more, but who knew that we would end up so tight, and plus he makes me horny, A LOT! :P haha and thats not a bad thing.... ummm, megan said that when paul gets back everything is going to be fucked, actualli to be honest, i thought so too, i thought that it was going to be like, omg paul is back, i want him to want me so badli, but its not like that!!! all i want is jeffie, i would so choose him over paul in 2 secs, haha, aw well, i am just glad that everything is so working out man... and especially to mi advantage... :) thats a first...  Lets see, well something that is not realli going mi wai, is that stupid summer school, i am soo close to failing, and i have a realli close chance of failing, and i have the test tomorrow, which i am prolli gonna fail too, i cannot believe how hard it is man.. aw well, we will see what happens... i dont realli wanna think about school... Haha, me and megz are getting along so well man, and she got her hair done, it looks fantastic, how it graces her amazingli gorgeous face, i must give it to her, she is one beautiful gurl... i couldnt also ask for a better best friend, she is such a sweetie, she is so nice, and i dont thnk she deserves me, with the wai i am, i am such a bitch, but i dont know, i am just glad that she is alwais there for me, and i hope that i am alwais there for her, but no one beats the stupendous megan, just because she is mi baybei, and no one will take her from me... shes all mine *evil face* haha naw im plaiing, im not that obsessive... i love her so much, and i am not going to lie, she is mi life, along side food, sleep, umm getting miself off, and i guess that jeffie can be apart of that list as well...  Lets see, man Chris Rogers is an awesome person too, i have to sai that he is mi best guy friend, i can talk to him about anything, and its awesome about how understanding, hes an awesome person, and a good friend, i have not known him for that long, but i mean, still he is wicked kewl...  Wow this is realli realli long, haha sorri to anybody who reads this i kinda feel bad, this is like wasting your life awai... :) Lets see, as for prayers go, PLEASE LET ME PASS SUMMER SCHOOL... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, and also another prayer is, me and jeffie will be together for a looooong time, and have lots o' fun if you know what i mean ;) haha so jeffie, if you read this (which you wont) you better get in mi pants soon baybei, before you make me, make you:P haha aw well, have a good nice sleeeeeepp America... Uh, i mean Canada... bye bye bye, N'sync styles bayyyybeiiii... :) Shhh... im tired, and i miss you jeffie, and i love you megan!!!

      *Sighs* Once again, someone broke mi hearat, and guess who it happens to be...? Of course it's fucking Paul, I just fucking found out that he has a gf in that gai camp thingy that he is at, isn't that wonderful? That's so whi he told me that we can onli be friends, well fuck him, after he tells me that he ids going to love me, and care for me, and even after we did the shit that we did, and feels that it is nothing...? Or something, right now all I can think about is, how bad i feel, how rejected, how awful... He totalli broke mi heart like it was a game, and now I have no wai to mend it, brcause I have tried everything.. I have tried telling miself that it is just another stupid crush, another stupid high-school thing, and you know what? That alwais works, but nope not this time... I'm so fucked, I don't know what I am going to do anymore... Everyone is telling me that I should just forget about him, and that he WILL NOT like me anymore after the summertime... well isnt this great, what I yearned for, what I desired is now so fucking far awai...  On the otherhand, everyone is telling me that I should get with Jeffie, I don't think that it would be right seeing as we are just super chill friends, and I don't know if I can picture miself completeli happi with Jeffie, although he has to be the wickest person that I have ever met, well one of em anyway... I just don't know, there is too much pressure, and I have been smoking like a fucking fiend, and now i have to go to stupid summer school, and i sooo dont want to go because it is going to be the equivelency of fucking hell, and i am not looking forward to having that on mi plate... I have so much to worri about, like smoking, guys, school, everything, everything, everything wont fucking leave me alone, i kind of feel closterphobic in mi own damn thoughts, i dont even know if that is legal in all of Canada, haha, well yea, I just am so confused right now i wish that i wasnt alive so i did not have to deal with all the goddamn bullshit, not to mention everyone fucking dying on me... hey that kind of reminds me of what paul said to me one time.. he said that mi beauty is like the very last sunset, a dying man is ever going to see.. it sounded better the wai that he said it though... :P I think that i have wasted so much time thinking about Paul, when i could have been thinking about something so much more better with mi thoughts instead of it. Aw well, i think that it would be so much kewler to have something that i had to look forward to, but there is nothing going on in mi life right now, that is sooo much to be looking forward to, everithing just seems like it is going downhill from here, and it is realli realli starting to get depressed... There is nothing that i can sai is going mi wai... so there is nothing good as far as i know, unless someone makes mi dai, except i saw that Anchorman movie, and i thought that is was so funni man, i loved it A LOT, and plus i got to see it with Jeffie right beside me so i had a lotta fun, and i laughed a lot which was good, haha i alwais can go to funni movies to cheer me up, i am just that kind of corny person... haha i laughed at like every funni part, and i have such an annoiing laugh too... haha it is kinda funni, but aw well, what are ya gonna do right? Right now, for god, if i was to make a prayer i dont think that i would pray for anything legit, seeing as i got a lot of good advice to a lot of shit that was fucking me up, but i think that i would realli want Paul to want me back, i realli wish that he would, but then again, by the end of the summer, and he wants me back then , he can fuck himself , cause there is no wai that someone that treated me that bad will have the ability to get me back, although there is a part of me that thinks that i would want to take him back, which makes me sound realli pathetic, but thats jst me, i am pathetic. But then again... well nevermind then again, because i know mi prayer would never ever come true, thats just the wai it is with me, nothing ever works mi wai, but i guess thats all i got for complaining i could have a lot worse to sai, but im not gonna sai ani of it, because all i do is complain, and i am sure that a lot of people are kinda prolli getting sick and tired of me... but what are you gonna do? Haha, so that is the end of this very long blog, so i will blog later, and i doubt anyone will be reading this, but hey... I LOVE YA ANYWAYZ! [{.X.x*Would you find it in your heart, to let this go awai?&nbsp;wont you let me rest in pieces...?*

       I know that i have a terrible habit of doing so, but i always feel as if i am so depressed, as if everything isnt going mi way... i think that I am selfish, and that I think too much of myself... This is just mi intro of my Blogging... Just to see the immature acts that I seem to always get myself caught in... We'll see if i can keep up with this whole thing. Seeing as I am realli not that dedicated of a person... fuck this shit... That's my quote... It's what I live by, but we will see if that changes... Right now... I think mi moods are; -Jealousy -Anxious -Unhappy AArrgghhhh... I just don't know what to do anymore... I think of giving up a lot... But I think i have too much of a good life to give up so early, althgouh a lot of depressing thoughts wander through mi mind as if it is the eternal walkway to hell...  I feel so Fucked... There is too fucking much going on right now... And mi letter to God is obviously not being recieved seeing as, no one is doing anything about mi problems... I guess no one realli cares... but then again... it is always up to me about mi choices... I think I am going to go and watch the Czech game! I hope we win...! =]

       The blood pours from mi wounds...    Mi fuckin broken heart lays on the floor...   Refusing to pick it up...   You walked awai in disgust...     Oh, how I wish I could die...                  I will still Alwais love you...     Don't forget it...                 It hurts  * Takes   out gun*      Blow me awai     Bay-bee          Write your name on my chest in kerosene. Spark a match andyou will never be   cold again. This is really only all we have.     I have a large collection of thunder that I stole from your windowsill.     You had the best damn Sunday dress at the end of the world. The wall of flames that consumed you and everything that was good, "not with a band but a whimper." What would you do? arms spread welcoming the impending nothing.          Fuck it, no one cared anyway...

       One again, mi luck is working to mi advantage... First off, I have strep throat... *rrr* i am so mad about that man, it is like killing like a fuckin bitch, i hate it, and i just got mi braces tightened as well, so thats even worse, EVEN worse is that i can't see mi jeffie for at least 2 dais, and thats hard, dont ask me why, i am a loser i know... but hey, i will live hopefulli, i dont want to die while i have strep throat... i doubt that i will, uhmmm... lets see, what is going on these dais, well on fridai the 13th... YES! i am supposed to go to the movies with chris and see alien vs. predator, i am so fuckin excited to see that man, honestli, i have been waiting forever to see it... i alreadi saw the first 4, like... 32545342591347534 times anyway... haha, so i finalli get to see a sequel, and the predator movies are fuckin amazing as well... but on that date is me and jeffie's month, i cannot believe that we have been going out for a month, for some strange reason it feels as if it could have been at least like half a year, i think it is because we were good friends before, and now that we are involved, NOW, it feels much longer... but thats not a bad thing... I have been talking to megan a lot about loving, and how i am scared, because being committed is such a wierd thing to be doing at such a young age, and plus, i never thought that i would be finding love at this time anyhow, but jeff told me that he is falling in love with me, and that made me feel good inside, it felt like a re-assurance... you know... And i was glad to know that someone could actualli be into me like that, you know? And i was triing to convonce miself that i wasnt falling in love with him miself... and everytime i would tri to convince miself, i couldnt... I could onli think positive thoughts, like there was absoluteli no reason for me to not love him, like in mi msn name, and all the times that i tell him... i cannot wait til i know it is actual love, and i can be like... I love you.. and actualli mean it... there must not be a better feeling in the world, then having someone to love, and them loving you back... i am a bit scared, although jeffie is completeli trustworthy, i just account for paul, and i think about how devoted i was to him, knowing he wasnt going to be here for 2 months, but i honestli fell in love with him immediateli. i have never felt that kind of passion over one person before, and i wanted to tell him, but he also has commitment problems... its okai though, he is mi past, but i think that there will be some wierdness between us... in the longrun we may be able to keep it as friends, but there will alwais be that little spark between him and i... no matter what, and if i could make it go awai, i would... but i dont think it ever will, i so remember every sweet thing paul used to sai to me, and how he would wait for me as well, we had so mani conversations about it, and he promised... he fuckin told me, we would be together, and then all of a sudden he changed his mind, that guy brought me the most sorrow in the world... he told me, when i "cheated" on him that time, that he wanted there to be an amazing gurl waiting there for him... and i would have been, i realli would have been... i wanted him, more than anything, mi desire was so strong, everything about him was so amazing, his smile, his attitude, the wai he kissed me, the wai he apologized, how he was alwais triing to talk to me, writing emails, and letters in school, i will never forget the moldi sandwich, i just sometimes wish that he would change his mind, but there would be absoluteli no reason what soever, for him to do that, i guess all i can do now is wish the best for him and his gf... thats it, i cant remember what he used to be like... Paul used to be amazingli genuine, and very truthful... i had a lot of fun with him, and we alwais had something to laugh about, i will never forget the time that he was drunk, and he was saiing all that amazing stuff about me, even though he was drunk, he still said it when he was sober... i dont know if i love jeff as much as i loved paul, but soon enough i think... i realli do... but paul, if you ever read this, you would know how i felt, and you knew it too... You know how dedicated to you i would have been, i dont think it matters anymore, but its okai... i was reading all the old emails that he sent me, i remember all the things he said to me... it reminded me of who he realli was... it made me realize... thats who he realli was, he was such a sweetheart, but now all i picture him is, a jackass, i remember all the text messages... i lived for those... and his notes, and how i would see him at mi locker EVERYTIME before class... aw man, those were good times, well now all i have to do is look at the future, and thats jeff, and i am so amazingli glad it is... i could NOT ask for any better, if there was, well i have alreadi established that, well, maybei he would be perfect... no one is perfect though... he is so damn close that it scares me... i just like the wai jeffie treats me, he treats me so well, he deserves so much better than me, and he refuses to realize that its true, but he realli could... one dai perhaps he will find a love better than me, but... well, i know that no highschool relationships last forever, and i have come to realize that, it will end, and i have to cherish it while i have it, it mai last a looong time, but i doubt much longer than 2 years, omg... imagine that, i would be 16 and he would be like 18, thats pretti insane... :P if so, our realtionship must be close to perfect... i couldnt imagine fighting with him though... what would i fight with him about?? i cant think of anything... haha i mean everything he does... i dont mind, and i guess i have a high tolerance for his handball, because he is so cute when he plais, and i love it when he gets all sweaty and stuff, i think that it is super adorable. the best thing with me and jeff, is that i know that jeffie used to be all sad, because he was loneli, and now that he has me he is happier, and i am not triing to be modest about it or anything its just that it is a fact... but i take jeff for who he is... i love everything about him, everything, everything!!! haha its just i dint know that i could find someone so perfect in every single wai, i never knew that such luck would hit such a terrible person, like me. its just i mean, i deserve so much less, someone who would push me around, you know? instead i got an amazing, funni, wonderful, guy, whom, could not get much better... wow, i so could go on about him all dai... but i will force miself to stop as of now, i am prolli gonna start getting repetitive... but we shall see. i hope everything is the same when school starts... so yah, (thats so paul) or so sue me... haha he used to sai that all the time... whoa, i think that i shoudl make a list of everything that reminds me of paul, and jeffie, i alreadi have done one of those for paul... oh yes, i must put another song on here that reminds me of jeffie, haha i think that me and pauls song was that funki town one, that one sooo reminds me of him, its insane... i remember that dai *sighs* so long ago... Well this is the song that reminds me of Jeffie, he alreadi knows that i am going to put this one on here, because i told him that i was going to yesterdai. so i guess that he knows... haha but i dont know how much he reads this thing, so i dont know what he thinks about me, i wonder if he trusts me, i realli super, hope he does...     War all the time-Thursday      I cant listen to anything by thursday and not think of jeff...       Lyrics...     Standing on the edge of the palisades cliffs
