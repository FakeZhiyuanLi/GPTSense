       So here I am... writing again. Not that anyone sees this, at least... I hope not sometimes. My brother asked me a few days ago why I don't show people my blog thing... I don't know. It's sorta a personal thing, if people don't know it's there... they won't read it. Thats' good sometimes I guess. I don't really like showing my  private  things anyway. Anyway... So yeah. I haven't written in here for awhile. I guess it's time for me to update... or something.    Mike  asked me to be his girlfriend yesterday. I of course said yeah. It's funny how this all turned out. When I first met him, I hated the kid with a passion. Seriously I loathed him and look at us now... we're together. I'm still afraid for Shawna's sake. I mean she says she's over him and I mean it's alright because they've been broken up for months... so it's alright for me and him to get together? She said it was fine... but I don't know... it doesn't seem like... she's fine with it. I really hope I didn't hurt her. I really like Mike but hey... chicks before dicks. He's been texting me all day. It's fun... talking to him. I don't know. It's weird to suddenly get together. I haven't wanted to at all. I didn't really want a boyfriend. I was ready to have one but I don't think I wanted to get one this soon. I don't like the feeling of being tied down... but sometimes you just have to let loose. I'm glad I'm with him though. I trust him and hopefully he trusts me... and well I guess that's good since we live four hours apart. CRAZY huh? I don't like long distance relationships, but I can get over it. I like the kid and he likes me and he can drive and he said he'd come up and see me : )    so it should all work out... a-okay. He wouldn't of asked me to be his g.f if he didn't trust me right? Whatever.  Mike said the other day when I told him taht I was afraid Shawna was mad because I liked him and he was like "Everything happens for a reason." and I guess it's true. I mean maybe there is a reason Mike and I got together and well Shawna can now get completely over him, if she's not already but I do wish she'd refrain from calling him gay. If he was gay... we wouldn't be going out.  Everything does happen for a reason I believe too. Heh heh... these entries get to in depth. Well I'm going to probably sleep over at Jill's later so.... peace.

       Boys. Are. Done.      I'm seriously so tired of them all. I've had my share of asswhole's this summer and I just need a break. I mean... well I'm not going to go become a lesbian? I mean how can you become one. Whatever. I mean... first there was RJ my best guy friend... who ended up being a jerk off and I stopped talking to him. Great. And then their is all those guys who think they're great because they can yell shit out of their windows while I mow the lawn. You're awesome. And then of course... my favorite Fuckhead.. Tyler. I don't even know what was so great about him? Was it because he was older? Because he almost acted like he cared... he should go into thearter... he'd get a fucking academy award. He fucking hurt me... bad... and I don't know why I even thought for a second that I should just trust this kid. You can't trust boys...  I'm tired of being me. I hate myself. I hate the way I am... the untrusting thing and the whole letting myself fall for someone deal. I wear my heart of my sleeve or whatever that means. I just seriously want to like shoot myself or something for for one time in my life, I let my guard down and decided to go with it... for the hell of it. I just ended up back where I was... about a few months ago... not knowing what was going to happen. I can't believe I'm so stupid. But no regrets. Shit happens... and sometimes for a reason.
