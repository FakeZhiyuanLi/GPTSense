        today i went and saw hellboy at the movies, i would hav rather seen eurotrip but that was on at 2 late a time. hellboy was ok, just ok, i would giv it probably only 2 stars. the story was shoddy and predictable and hard 2 follow properly. the action was pretty good and so were the special effects, but all the action was dun in dark light so it was hard 2 c properly. or maybe i'm going blind. 1 or the other. good win 4 the rowers of australia. heres the ozzies medal tally:

        the olympics r not pointless. certain teams may b disadvantaged due 2 lak of funds, and may not hav many athletes and the athletes they do hav aren't up 2 the standed of the richer olympic teams. but the olympics r not pointless. 4 the wealthier teams there is a lot of competition, & watching ppl who r generally brilliant and talented and gifted at certain events can b breath-taking. ppl who whinge and carry on about how the olympics r stupid r just wannabes who want 2 look different by being all pesimistic and un-patriotic. all the athletes try extremly hard, and its great 2 c wen they defy the odds. like jana pittman recovering from her knee injury, and the iraq olympic team making it 2 athens. anyway, heres the current olympic medal tally 4 australia (out of all gold medals won we're 4th behind usa, china &japan, but in number of all medals won we're third behind usa &amp;china):

        today we had impro sports. it was ok but i think it could hav gone on longer. mr sgroi came 2 talk 2 us about the number of kids leaving our class, i asked him about the moreland kids coming 2 brunswick and he sed that they would not make a big difference on the school. if they did they would b expelled fairly quickly. r there going 2 b anymore topics 4 discussion on the blogs? has zoe chosen any mor? anyway, heres the current medal tally 4 australia. ozzies r now 4th, but in amount of all medals r third.

        well i've posted late in the day coz i was talking 2 evan on the phone. pretty ordinary day, stayd home sik, watched  angel  on dvd and then some older episodes on video. didn't watch much olympics coz i'd listend 2 it live on radio and we had lost most of the events that were played on tv earlier in the day. watched the first minute of american pie, all ready seen it years ago. not going 2 repeat the 1st scene about the sock and the illegal bad receptiond tv channel. i taped it so i could watch it later. good win by petria thomas, BUT DID OUR MENS RELAY SWIMMING TEAM SUCK OR WOT?!? FIFTH PLACE! FIFTH PLACE! THATS A DISGRACE! OUR WORLD RECORD BROKEN BY THE SOUTH AFRCANS! didn't monkey ears (phelp) swim well though. americans were coming 7th and he got them bak up 2 third. i can't wait 4 the 200m freestyle. thorpe, hackett, phelp and i think vandenwotshisface all competing. jana pitman is probably going 2 compete but i reckon she'll pull out after a couple of heats, i was talking 2 evan about this and he thinks so 2. apparantly even though shes puting on a brave face her mum says that jana told her that her knee is causing her a great deal of pain after runs. going now

        sorry 4 not posting yesterday, my internet connection wasn't working. THORPE WON GOLD!!! HACKET WON SILVER!!!  and some relay     womens team won gold, and broke a world record, bla bla bla, all been done before.   THORPE WON GOLD!!! HACKETT WON SILVER!!! if u noticed i changed my bakround 2 ian thorpe just after he won the 400m freestyle, but don't worry, my richmond backround will b bak wen the olympics is over. i've basically been watching the olympics non stop coz i've had a cold and not been able 2 do much else. our volleyball teams r not bad and nither is the softball team. pity our only gymnastic dude stuffed up and got low marks. also a pity our boxer (4got his name) lost by a point wen he'd been leading the entire match except 4 the last 5 seconds. ozzies r second on the medal tally so far would u believe. that won't last though. ciao 4 now

       sup ppl, today was pretty boring and mr molloy wasn't here again so we didn't do anything of importance in health. wood was ok but i just sanded and varnished. sose and italian were ok but we didn't do much. olympic ceremony starting tomorrow. don't think i'll stay up 2 3am 2 watch. nothing else 2 say so here r sum jokes:      -    Two guys are golfing on a course that is right next to a cemetery. After they tee off, one of the golfers notices that there is a funeral procession passing by. So he takes off his hat, and places it over his heart. When the funeral is over, the other golfer looks at the guy and asks, ''Why did you do that?'' The man replies, ''Well we were maried for almost 40 years. It's the least I could do.''      -      You might be a redneck if your father walks you to school because you're both in the same grade!      -      Juan comes up to the Mexican border on his bicycle. He's got two large bags over his shoulders. The guard stops him and says, "What's in the bags?" "Sand," answered Juan. The guard says, "We'll just see about that get off the bike." The guard takes the bags and rips them apart; he empties them out and finds nothing in them but sand.He detains Juan overnight and has the sand analyzed, only to discover that there is nothing but pure sand in the bags. The guard releases Juan, puts the sand into new bags, hefts them onto the man's shoulders, and lets him cross the border. A week later, the same thing happens. The guard asks, "What have you got?" "Sand," says Juan. The guard does his thorough examination and discovers that the bags contain nothing but sand.He gives the sand back to Juan, and Juan crosses the border on his bicycle. This sequence of events if repeated every day for three years. Finally, Juan doesn't show up one day and the guard meets him in a Cantina in Mexico. "Hey, Buddy," says the guard, "I know you are smuggling something. It's driving me crazy. It's all I think about..... I can't sleep. Just between you and me, what are you smuggling?" Juan sips his beer and says, "Bicycles."      -      please post a comment and vote on my poll

       today oak park played their finals match... and were flogged. the final score was oak park: 4 goals 5 behinds to westmeadows: 11 goals sumthing behinds. the coach was really pissed off and he gave us the "i'm just dissapointed boys" speach. but their captain was corey mckernan's little brother (if u can call him little coz he was way taller than me). so after that i went to cassie's house (rachael and evan should know who cassie is, and tom ward), and we played hockey. cassie said she's goalie for the state, so i thought "bloody hell, i can't even win in my first EDFL finals match". after we left and went home i had a shower coz i was covered in mud (the centre of the oval was just a mud bath so i kept slipping wen i was trying to ruck). bye for now

       i know i wrote earlier this evening but i thought i'd add a bit more about my evening so here goes; i've just got back from footy training and i thought that considering we're in the finals it would hav been a bit harder, but we hardly had to any really hard work, just drills... wait, there was 1 thing we did that was hard, here's what happened (the conversation and actions that occured that were hard):       just finished a drill       david (coach): ok boys that'll do, bob [assistant coach] take them for a run and do sum push-ups      bob (assistant coach): right       team jogs to goal square         bob: ok boys get down in push-up position       everybody gets  in push-up position, except for the fat kids and the weak kids, and ashley (the wierdo kid who comes to our training but never plays with us, i guess he also counts as a weak kid though)       bob: alright let's do ten       everybody does ten, except the fat and/or the weak kids and ashley (the freak)         bob: now hold it       everybody holds there last push up except the fat and/or the weak kids and ashley (the freak) who just fall down or stick their bums in the air         bob: alright let's do seven and hold it       everybody does ten, except the fat and/or the weak kids and ashley (the freak) and everybody holds there last push up except the fat and/or the weak kids and ashley (the freak) who just fall down or stick their bums in the air       bob: let's do five and hold it       damn those fat and/or weak kids + ashley coz their not even trying now, it's just a mass of bodies puting their bums in the air         bob: let's do one and hold it       now surely they could do one but nooooooooooo, they consider themselves special, and just sought of jerk up and down         bob: let's do another one and hold it       there's no point even considering them doing push ups now coz there trying to focus on the "hold it" part which is the bit where you just have to hold yourself in the air       bob: let's do one more and hold it       i guess i'm a bit hard on ashley, i mean, he is a bi f****d in the head poor guy, that only encourages people in the team to tease him, he is a bit weird though       bob: hoooold it...       everyone attempts to hold it         bob: hoooooooold it...       it's getting a bit sore now         bob: hoooooooooooooooold it...       hurry up you nazi, my abs r killing me...         bob: that'll do      -      that's an example of what we do every training session, and it's usually way harder than that. oh, i hav 1 more thing to say. i checked everyones blogs, AND THEY SUCKED!!! just thought i'd mention that. so for now it's goodbye from the wilsonator.

      here r some jokes i know. enjoy...  -  A bunch of Saddam Hussein's body doubles were waiting in a lounge when they heard on the news that Saddam's palace had been bombed. One of Saddam's advisors called them and said he had good news and bad news. The doubles said they wanted the good news first, so the advisor said that Saddam had survived the blast. The doubles were greatly relieved. "Then what's the bad news?" they asked. "Saddam lost one of his arms," the advisor replied.  -  Two girlfriends were speeding down the highway at well over 90 mph. "Hey," asked the brunette at the wheel, " do ya see any cops following us?" The blonde turned around for a long look. "As a matter of fact, I do." "Damn!" cursed the brunette. "Are his flashers on? The blonde turned around again. "Yup... nope... yup... nope... yup...."  -  How many elves does it take to wallpaper Santa's workshop? It depends how thinly you slice them.
