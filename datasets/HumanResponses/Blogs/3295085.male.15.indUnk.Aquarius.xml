      If you have a cold or something, sudafed is not a good choice. I took one thinking it was going to be non-drowsy. They lied. I slept for about 4 hours after taking it and it still is not working correctly. Sudafed sucks.

      I recommend to all people that they try Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. It is a free multiplayer first-person shooter that I am addicted to. Try it here http://games.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/

      I don't know about anyone else, but I think that we have had enough of this "mourning" for Reagan. It has been several weeks now and the flags are  still  at half mast. No one cares anymore!!! Reagan wasen't really a good president when he was in office, so why are we still mourning his death?!? If this "mourning" went any farther, this is what might happen...

      I had an  EXTREMELY  bad family reunion this year. Apparently, my aunt and uncle's nanny came to work with the stomach flu the day before they left to go to the reunion and got my year-old cousin sick. When they arrived, my cousin got his 2 year old sister sick. In addition, they stayed in the same cabin as my family. They got my family sick along with my grandparents, and about 15 other family members sick. Everyone had vomited at least once, including myself. My grandfather got it so bad that he passed out and we had to call for an ambulance. My cousins had to go to the hospital because of dehydration. It was  definately  a memorable experience.

      The official game of the U.S. Army is really crappy. To even start a game, you have to endure stupid training missions. In the aircraft jump mission, you have to land from a plane 10,000 feet in the air onto a 5 foot wide circle on the ground. When you finally get online, the experience is slightly better, but still sucky. The menus are laggy, the controls suck, and it is  way  too easy to die. You'd think that the Army, with all its billions of dollars,  might  make a good game. Apparently, they can't. Worst of all on this game, it crashes often enough to make you think that it was a beta of version 1, when in fact it is the final version of 2.1. That is really sad.

      I saw Troy on Friday. It was a very good movie, but it had some very odd moments. One such moment was when the two giant armies are in the middle of fighting, and when the prince of troy is fighting the greatest fighter of the greek army. When the prince kills Achilles (greatest fighter), he slits his throat and all of the soldiers stop to watch. When the prince pulls off the helm of Achilles, he finds out that the person he was fighting was actually Achilles's young cousin. When the prince saw this, he said to the general of the other army "That's enough for today" and both armies went back to their bases. I was left scratching my head at how both armies would go back to their bases in the middle of a freaking WAR!!!

      I encountered this little bug in IE some time ago and now feel like writing about it. If you input the code " @;/*" (without quotes) into the html of a webpage IE6 will crash. Presenting the 11 byte IE crasher. Quite possibly the dumbest reason for an error  EVER!!!

      Anchorman has to be the funniest film this year. From the first second of the movie, I could tell it would be funny. It opens with "Based on a true story, only the names, places, and events have been changed". One of the best characters was Brick (STEVE CARELL-The Daily Show, Bruce Almighty.) Brick had an IQ of about 40 and is first found globbing mayonase into a toaster. Anchorman is the best film that I have seen this summer.

      My town's fireworks were very well done this year. However, they seemed to have miscalculated where the ash from the fireworks would fall. Everyone in the area I was sitting in was bombarded with ash. I myself got hit with an uncountable number of quarter-sized pieces. Some landed while still on fire and nearly caused some fires. Hopefully next year they will think about where they are aiming the fireworks more carefully.
