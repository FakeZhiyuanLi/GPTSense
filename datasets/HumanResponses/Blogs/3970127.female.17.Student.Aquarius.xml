      I was chatting to Libby on msn today - it has been great catching up. With the time difference, I'm usually slaving away at school when she's online, and with her doing the HSC and me the IB, we've gotten soooo busy! So I think the new mode is to have a blog, and Libby twisted my arm into getting one - saying, "at least just to keep me updated!"  There you have it - a blog to see into my little hobbit hole. My posts might be deep &amp; meaningful, random or pointless, so take them or leave them. love you all!

      When I was at Howard's and Freddy's there was this terrible programme on TV. It was a talk show between a  urlLink gay  man and a Christian. Thing is, the way it happened, it made the Christian sound horrible. It made Christianity look like a prison...and this is the image that everyone gets of Christianity. :(. It frustrated me SO much. Also, at  urlLink school  I'm so not open about my faith...I don't know if its because I'm worried what  urlLink people  will think of me, of if its just because God is such a taboo word at  urlLink school  ? hmmmmm

      I worked at Nyon Hopsital today. I am exhausted! I arrived at 8am, got suited up (I looked sooo professional!) and then off I went. I really enjoyed it, and I had a certain peace about it, that I know that Physiotherapy is the thing for me. (I have lots of pros and cons about it:) ) I spent most of the day with Boris, a hot Physio, heehee, and he was really great. He taught me some stuff during  urlLink free  moments, and techniques etc. Although, at one point since I was his "belle assisante Ecossaise", (for some reason he didn't call me Anglaise) a lady had come in because she has a handicapped friend and he was teaching her how to get him in and out of  urlLink wheelchairs , so I was the guinea pig :) haha - I wasn't complaining! ;) I also worked with two women: Anne and Mireille, who were both very nice. I did some work up in the geriatrics ward, where there was a guy called Francoise around my age who was Nurses' Age, who again, was very attractive, and we had a good  urlLink time  lifting nice old ladies out of their  urlLink beds  and for a walk along the corridor!! I also worked a bit in the soins intensif, which was quite sad :(. So yes, I had a good day!

      back again...it was a lonnnnnng holiday! The first week, in Scotland, was exhausting :) We saw a lot of my Aunt Jean & Uncle Roddy, with their kids: Alison (8), Ross (5) and Jamie (2). (A LOT of  urlLink free  babysitting). Don't get me wrong, they're great kids, but all day, almost every day, of, "Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, can we have another race?". We saw all the relatives: grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and 2nd cousins (two 2-year olds). I  urlLink love  my grandparents'  urlLink house  tho, a great big victorian  urlLink house  :) Very authentic.  We then went to Ipswich in East Anglia and stayed with my uncle Rodney &amp; aunt Tracey. Their two boys are Howard (18) and Freddy (17) - yes Libby they are both quite good looking young men (or so my  urlLink friends  have told me) (Howard's off to Nottingham Uni to study Mathematics this october! :) But another four days of my brother, freddy and howard...(aaaaaaahhh!) I do have some amusing  urlLink video  footage of them doing wacky dives into their outdoor pool (Yes, we went swimming in their open-air outdoor swimming pool, in ENGLAND!) (They also have a  urlLink tennis  court). Its unfair tho, because I'm older than Freddy, and he's driving because in the UK you can get your licence at 17, and I can't drive yet :P Oh well. We saw the Bourne Supremacy, which wasn't as godo as the first one, but still was quite seat-gripping. So yes, I am glad to be  urlLink home , although th Evans' have been house-sitting and won't be leaving until Wednesday.  Tomorrow will be Lindsey Recover Day, Do Homework day (because I have done absolutely nothing, apart from manage to leave my copy of Othello in the rental car), and then I'll be working in the Hopsital on Tuesday & Wednesday, then babysitting for Cathy Thursday &amp; Friday I think. :) Busy busy busy!

Then I'm working in Nyon hospital for work experience the 17th and 18th, and then I'm babysitting for Cathy for four days. And then  urlLink school  starts on the 2nd september!!!

      i was reading an article in time magazine today about obesity: 2/3 of US adults are officially overweight, and about half of those are full-blown obese. and 15% of kids (aged 6-19) are overweight, and another 15% headed that way. even 25% of dogs and cats are overweight.  Even in the EU, 18% of kids are overweight/obese. I just find this appalling, how it could ever have got this far. How in schools now, PE has been taken away, how in cafeterias they have pizza hutt and mcdonalds, and tons of soft drinks. I just find it appalling. I mean - don't people realise that they are subjecting themselves to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, infertility, gall bladder disease, osteoarthritis, and many forms of cancer?  It's also upsetting how many of my friends are on diets - or keep saying that they are fat (When they are skinny!), Food is such a hard issue for so many people, how we look, etc. I guess its peer pressure to look like models, be pretty, perfect...  Yesterday I went to Geneva with Elaine &amp; Miranda. Elaine and I went on some upside down rides and that new 50 m high swinging one - ahhh - it was fun :) I could feel the blood rush to my toes!!! But the few of the lake was beautiful. Today we're biking to Signy centre to go shopping!  All summer we've been going to 'Differenciels', this is the place to be in Nyon. It's really funky, they have great paninis and salads. yum yum ! So I recommend it :-) ( urlLink http://www.differenciels.ch/ )

       I LOVE this time of year. Another gorgeous day - I will set the scene: I am surrounded by fields & forest, blue sky, a glimpse glistening lake and mountains on both sides.      but.. there's Paleo....fete de Geneve...there are even jazz bands playing in Nyon! Lainey is back! yay!!! It had been five weeks since I had seen her - with trips to N. Ireland, Tanzania, Nottingham, South Africa in between, so lots of catching up to do. And I leave on Wednesday again, so it will be a short catch up. We going to have our boggle rematch, bike to the lake, swim, then go on all the upside down rides in geneva. fun fun fun :-) It is scary thinking how we first met when we were five years old...:O Now we're signing up for our driving first aid courses & theory courses &amp; applying to university!! how time flies.   right : walk dog & work. (although, don't think I'll get much work done:) )

       I read thru this today (my utmost for His highest devo), and it really struck me:  "It is not true to say that God wants to teach us something in our trials: through every cloud He brings, He wants us to unlearn something. "  and  "It is by those very clouds that the Spirit of God is teaching us how to walk by faith. If there were no clouds, we should have no faith. "  and "The clouds are a sign that He is there. What a revelation it is to know that sorrow and bereavement and suffering are the clouds that come along with God! God cannot come near without clouds, He does not come in clear shining. "  This is a devos from a few days ago, but it was nabbing away at my subconscience (sp?). I've been thinking a lot about it because a friend was going through a rough time, basically asking, "Where is God? Why isn't He near?" and another friend has had a really rough year, not being on fire or motivated, and just struggling. So it really stood out about unlearning, and also how God does not come in clear shining. Just thinking about obediance &amp; faith. :-) This is what I was thinking about today whilst I was walking Ryan up at La Dole, and it was so beautiful, the sun shining, with no clouds. (it was b-e-a-utiful)...sigh.   On a lighter note: Happy 1st of August (The Fete National of Switz). I'm going to my commune's dinner tonight, to show my face, (I have been accepted by the federal, and its now back to the commune to be voted on in Sept for my Swiss naturalisation!!!!!).
