      (old email from 4.01.03)  From the author of "the cat ate my banana bread" comes "something is going horribly wrong with my boot."  I'm wearing these brown boots, right? Giant chunky heel, good 3 inches. Makes me look 5'10". So all day, as I walk up and down the halls, I hear this weird clunk, and I figure it's just one of those strange phenomena in which the crease of my jeans is hitting the heel of the boot and making a funny sound. It happens sometimes, like the swish-swish of corduroys.  So just now, I parted from James' cube and on my way back to my desk--maybe a total of 20 steps--I get this repeat popping noise in my left boot. It's not the usual ankle-cracking sound I usually hear. (Or, as Anne Marie would say, the ankle-cricking sound.) Bewildered and perplexed, I keep stopping in the hall to confirm my hearing, finding only that when I stop walking, the noise also ceases. So I take a few more strides and round the corner, promptly parking in a chair and ripping the boot off my foot. I turn it upside-down and shake it, and there's a clear rattling noise--as though there is a small stone in the heel. (Or, as Kevin would say, dirt in the wheel.) I ask Norik to confirm my noise. He looks on in disbelief that the supposedly "solid" heel of my boot could be making such a sound. Shocked, we decide I must deboot the other foot and compare. The other boot makes no sound.  So we stand in the hall, shaking the noisy boot and trying to figure out the rattle. This is what we are doing when Paul, the man who already thinks I'm insane for talking long-distance on the phone to my dog in Florida, walks by with a concerned expression upon his face. When I try to demonstrate the bizarre incident to him, he runs away fearing for his life.  I shake and shake and shake the boot. Norik and I agree that we can feel whatever it is inside the heel against our hand, and that most likely, it's the core of the heel crumbling. We wish for a drill with which to inspect inside the heel, but since we are lacking, we just decide to shake it some more. Eventually, I put the boot back on, and now I am waiting for the moment when the heel totally crumbles and I roll and break my ankle and fall down a flight of stairs, smashing my head on the fire hose pipe at the bottom, which knocks me unconscious into a coma, causing me to miss my Italian class which Hot Paul takes as a sign that I am not interested in his hotness, so he drops out and joins another level and meets some bored mother-of-three named Rhonda who flirts with him incessantly. All because of my boot.  Clearly, I am too bored at work today.

      (old email from 6.03.03)  **Rated F for F-bombs.**   Stop me if you've heard this one...  So, this morning I turn on the shower, and do my now-standard "look around the shower for  big bug " check. Seeing none, I take off my glasses and get into the shower. While I'm in there, I think about how silly I am to check for these big damn bugs every day. It's no longer monsooning outside like it was the day of the two assaults. Foolish girl, I thought. Foolish girl.  At the end of my shower, I turn off the water, grab my towel, and step onto the floor. Through my incredibly poor vision, which most closely resembles trying to see through a sheet of wax paper, I notice a dark spot on the wall above the door in the bathroom--a spot I've never noticed before, even with my bad vision. Convinced this "spot" must be another centipede out to get me, I put on my glasses, only to realize that they are completely fogged-up by the steam from the shower.  Cautiously, I reach and open the bathroom door, inviting fresh air in to de-fog my spectacles. I fan the air in front of my face hoping to speed the process, while the whole time I'm on the verge of hyperventilating because if this spot is, in fact, another centipede out to get me, what will I do? Andrea is not home. My bug-killer has left already.  While I'm deciding this, the fog clears. Slowly, I lift my eyes to the corner of the wall and...  Oh holy hell!!! It IS another centipede out to get me!!! I bolt out of the bathroom, put on some flip-flops, run to the kitchen, and dig around for some poisonous spray. In the back of my mind, I hear animal-loving Karen saying "Trap it. Save it. Put it in a jar." But I think, fuck that. Raid would be most ideal right now. But I'll settle for Windex or Pledge or anything else that might kill that mo-fo without me having to touch it. And then, like a dream come true, I spot the Raid under the kitchen sink, which I am afraid to grab because it too is in a dark, damp place, and could have centipedes crawling all over it.  Eventually, I make my way back to the bathroom, fully armed. I decide I should stand up on the toilet seat for the best Angle of Death, but as Andrea knows, that is not a wise idea on our toilet--the damn lid shifted and I nearly took a header into the wall. Only half breathing, I step back down from the toilet, tell the bug "You're about to die, you little fucker," and give him a good shot of Raid.  He squirms! He flinches! He flails! He...falls to the floor right in front of me and starts to run away!! I spray him again--but he resists. Finally, in a moment of complete desperation, I pounce, slamming my flip-flop onto his ugly, feathery existence. I lift my foot...he's dead. A few dozen of his legs are stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Without screaming or fainting, I wipe the mess off my shoe and the other mess of the floor (including the Raid), toss it into the toilet, and flush.  I killed a bug today. A big ugly bug. All by myself.

      (Old email from 6.15.2004)  Hello. And yes, I am still alive.  I've been getting all the standard complaints from people in the last two weeks or so that I've "disappeared" or "fallen off the face of the earth." I know. I'm sorry. But I'm here now!!   things are good.   I am in New York, and I love it. Love it! I am more or less settled into my new apartment (save for the three or four remaining bins of shoes and clothes that I can't seem to figure out what to do with even though they take up half the available floor space in my bedroom). The weather's been fantastic, and I've been out exploring the city. And I've most definitely learned a few things along the way...   shoes.   As many of you are aware, I have a lot of shoes. Some may argue that it is too many, but I say you are wrong! But I've learned a valuable shoe lesson in the last two weeks.  One night I wanted to be the New York girl with the adorable shoes. So I slid on a pair of something cute, and trotted off down the street. The subway is four avenue blocks (versus the much shorter street blocks) from my apartment. By 1st Ave I was smiling at my cute feet. By 2nd Ave I was grimacing slightly at would-be blisters. By 3rd Ave I was thankful that I had to wait for the signal to cross the street so I could pull my feet out of the shoe and examine the damage. By Lexington Ave, I was shuffling along with a sad pout upon my face. I got on the subway and thought "This can't be happening. These shoes never hurt my feet before."  Yeah, well, joke's on me. Of COURSE this didn't happen to me before. I wore my shoes for 30 seconds while I walked from my bedroom to my car, at which point the highest shoe risk became that it might slip off the gas pedal while I attempted a four-lane passing maneuver on 128. I would then walk in the shoes for 30 more seconds from my car to my desk at work. The shoes never got so much use in Boston as they did in one mere walk to the subway in New York.  Moral of the story? I now wear flip-flops or sneakers every where I go. That pile of gorgeous shoes? In my closet. Just sitting there. Waiting for a real bona fide excuse to be worn, like, say, the end of the world.   yankees fans.   It turns out that my roommate's friend works in the Yankees ticketing office, and can score us tickets just about any time we want them. So one night he said "Do you want to go to the game tomorrow?" Alexis looked at me and I said "YES!" I turned back to James and said "Can I wear my Johnny Damon shirt?" to which he replied "Only if you want to die." The truth was that he was sitting us in club seats, and if anyone found out he gave a club seat to a non-Yankees fan, he'd be in deep doo-doo. So we agreed I would dress in neutral attire. I figured it was probably safer for myself too, what with all the nasty Yankees fans.  So we got to the stadium and it was incredible--my first time there. Our seats were an amazing four rows from the field, directly behind A-Rod (and his nice little behind). And all the while I sat there, not once did I hear anyone say "Red Sox." Not "Red Sox suck" or "I hate Nomar" or anything. Nor were there t-shirts for sale that said "Red Sox suck, Nomar swallows." As inning after inning passed, I grew increasingly unthreatened by my surroundings, and realized that no one there was going to kill me.  Then I leaned over to Alexis and James and told them how in Boston, there was a constant, lingering, palpable hatred for the Yankees in the air at ALL times. I told them about the "Yankees Suck" t-shirts and the "Yankees Haters" hats. They were appalled. I told them about the "Yankees Suck" chants that erupted from any and every event that grouped mass amounts of bitter Bostonians. They were astonished. And it was right then that I realized--they don't hate us. WE hate THEM. This is a one-way grudge instilled in us by generation after generation of inherited heartache and disappointment, NOT by the actual Yankees. This was mind-blowing and eye-opening for me, and I wanted to share the knowledge, so in an effort to make it more relatable to the masses, I offer this analogy:  Envision two people walking their dogs down the street, towards each other. One is, say, a giant, proud German Shepard. The other is a little ankle-biting poodle. The poodle's leash is taut as he squeak-barks viciously at the giant Shepard, who after glancing unbothered over his shoulder, promptly dismisses and forgets the obnoxious poodle. The Shepard and his owner stroll away unphased, but the poodle is about to have a massive coronary because he hates the Shepard and wants to kill it. In fact, even when the Shepard is no longer in sight, the poodle is still running midget circles around his owners feet, frantically squealing his hatred for the Shepard. It's a big deal to the poodle. It's all he can think about. But the other people and dogs that walk by just say "That is one sad, crazy dog."  (send all hate mail using comment tool below)   that's all for now.   This email is long enough, so I will wrap up here. (Truthfully, it's because I keep kicking the surge protector switch under my desk and turning of my computer and losing the contents of this message. Done it twice already!) But there is much else to share, and share I will.  The crazy new New Yorker, Stephanie

      (old email from 7.28.04)  I just want you all to know I just nearly lost my finger in an unfortunate cleaning incident.  See, the chair in my office had a hydraulic problem. I would sit and be working and all of a sudden the hydraulics would let go, and I'd drop 3 or 4 inches and my knee would knock me in the jaw. After a few days of this funny but annoying behavior, I decided to go cube shopping to see what else I could find.  So I go to no-longer-Chester's cube and steal his chair. As I wheel it into my cube in the fashion of pushing a grocery cart whose one squeaky wheel refuses to rotate in the same manner as its brethren because a mangled piece of last week's romaine lettuce is wedged in, I notice that the "new" chair, like the romaine lettuce, is a bit, well, grungy. So I pull out my handy dandy plastic container of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. You know, the ones that look rather like the moist towellettes you use on a baby's smelly ass? But ever since I bought these DisinfectingWipes, they refuse to properly exit the sphincter-like hole in the lid. Although the wipes are perforated, they do not tear properly, and constantly I either get a microscopic shred of a wipe, or I pull half the roll out at once. Usually I pop the lid off and pull them back through from the other side, but today....oh today....  After cleaning what appeared to be coffee grime and fingernail clippings (EW) off the arm of no-longer-Chester's chair, I turn to the wipes and decide to stick my index finger into the sphincter-like whole in the lid to jam the excess wipes back IN to the container. However, I quickly realized that this was a Very Bad Idea. The pointed and sharp plastic teeth immediately started digging into my flesh, and I instantly realized that this was designed for one-way passage only. The pain intensified and I bit my lip, thinking as quickly as possible how to proceed. Feeling like a cartoon character who had a giant lobster claw clamped onto my poor, defenseless finger tip, I contemplated grabbing the scissors left-handed to cut myself free, or giving one giant tug that would inevitably rip of chunks of flesh and leave me known hereforward as "the girl with 9 fingers who sits near Ivette." I even wondered how far the nearest hospital was so I could have the lid surgically removed, or have my finger re-attached. Or both. As my fingertip reddened with pressure and panic began to set in, I somehow used my clamped hand to get the lid off the container. Things did not look good.  So I studied the design of the plastic, trying earnestly not to have a Terrett's style cursing session in the middle of the silent office. I tried to pull my finger out but DAMN did it hurt! I tried using my other hand to lift at least one of the teeth away from my finger but there was no give whatsoever. So eventually I settled for lubing it up with, of all things, a soapy pre-moistened Disinfecting Wipe, and winced in agony as I pulled my pulsating finger free from the jagged teeth. It's now deformed, quite sore, and a few layers of skin are indeed missing. But I managed to do it without bloodshed, cursing, or asking for assistance. The feeling is starting to come back now too.  I tell ya, no-longer-Chester's chair better be worth it.

      (Old email from 7.15.04)  Have your laughs. But this one outdoes any of my near-death experiences in my car.  Today my new co-worker Erica and I decided to go out to lunch. I, as usual, was cashless and needed to hit an ATM first but Erica said she'd cover me until tomorrow. So we go to this Italian cafe at her suggestion. We get a seat outside in the garden, out from under the protective covering of the rooftop. The noontime sunlight is filtering through the treetops, and the sky is bright blue. It's a beautiful day for outdoor dining.  We order some antipasto and a meal. We sip our water. Our food comes out and we get freshly shredded cheese. And then...in the matter of seconds the following occurs:  High over our heads we hear a rustling of the tree leaves. I think to myself "hmm, must be a squirrel or something." I look skyward, as does Erica, and the woman at the table next to us. Our eyes rise just in time to see a giant 5-foot long plank of wood hurling through the leaves, bounce off the roof, ricochet off a wall and land directly on the ground beside our table. While Erica and I sit braced and speechless, a waiter rushes over and stares into the sky. More waiters gather. Erica and I look at each other in disbelief and start laughing. A waiter asks us if we are okay. We say we are and laugh more, both hoping we don't have spinach in our teeth while everyone in the restaurant is looking at us.  A waiter picks up the wood and runs away. A woman behind me suggests we wear hard hats. The manager comes over to make sure we haven't been mamed in the spontaneous wood dropping. We insist we are fine, but eat the rest of our meal with one eye in the sky, not knowing if there will be more.  A few minutes later, the manager comes back. The building next door has construction going on on the roof, some 10 or 12 stories. The wood fell from there. The man responsible saw it fall and came down to see if there was damage. He bought our lunch, and I didn't need to borrow Erica's money after all.

      Last night, like many other people, I was watching the Olympics on TV. I was glued to the women's gymnastics, the one sport that never fails to bring feigned high-intensity media drama that exists only on the television and not in real life. Every other sentence starts with "As a girl in a devistated Russia..." or "In a poor Romanian village..." Whatever. Just show me the uneven bars and shut the hell up. Thank god for the Mute button.  Anyhow, I'm watching and it's down to the last rotation. I eagerly await the competition, and during a commercial break I decide to look up (on the internet, of course) how tall Svetlana Khorkina (aka, Ostrich Girl) is. She seems to tower over other gymnasts with her long neck--I mean legs--but I know she can't possibly be all that tall. Turns out she's 5'5". I wanted to compare that to the tiny Romanian I became a fan of: Oana Ban. She's a mere 4'6". For the hell of it I checked Carly Patterson, a very median 4'9". And right there, right next to her face, was the unignorable, suspense-ruining headline "Patterson follows Hamm with another all around gold."  After yelling, screaming, and cursing that I accidentally saw the result online two minutes before I would have seen it on TV, I decided to watch anyway. Surely I was in for a good performance. So I did, and I saw the "Texas dynamo," the "next Mary Lou" stay upright on a 4" piece of wood. Amazing.  So she wins, people clap, Ostrich Girl cries, blah blah blah. And eventually the news lady, who was thankfully NOT Elfie f-ing Shlaegel (Elfie? Elfie? Come on now, please, what kind of a name is that?), rushes over to Carly Patterson in proper Olympic style: microphone in hand, overly dramatic questions firing away before the athlete has even caught her breath. This always annoys me, but this time what annoyed me more was the answers.  "Carly, you just won gold. How do you feel?"  "I'm just like, wow, like, I just like, won the gold medal. I don't even like know how I feel right now." I was HORRIFIED at how this girl, this child, was speaking. She must have like, said "like" like, 42 times in 6 seconds. Now, I know it happens. "Like" is a frequent word out of my own mouth, but you damn well better believe that if someone stuck a microphone in front of my face so I could tell the world how I felt about a gold medal, I'd switch to Non-Like mode before I spoke.  Yeah, I know, I know. She's only 16. Every 16 year old girl in America speaks this way now, and she's no different. But that's exactly my point. Are they like, teaching this in grammar lessons now? Does the Blue Book now have a chapter assigned to  Proper Use of the Word 'Like'  in which students are instructed to place "like" before every major adjective, adverb, and verb, or in place of commas? What is like, going on here??  What's worse, non-Americans are watching this interview with distraught looks on their faces as they try to translate these strange little syllables that occur 6-8 times per sentence. "Habib, go get my dictionary. What means this 'like'??" And Brits just shake their heads, thinking "first they dumped our tea, now they are ruining our language."  Yes, maybe we are. But that's what makes America great. You can like, totally butcher the language, and like totally sound like an idiot on television but like, we don't care, and we'll like, still totally give you a gold medal anyway. Oh and by the way, like nice dismount.

      Most people know that I spend a lot of time online. It's what I do. It's who I am. Many of you come to me when you need to research something that you cannot find on your own because you know I can find it. Or there's the other crowd of you (you know who you are) who are now trained to find local doppler radar maps so Barb can be warned of incoming thunderstorms.  Last night I had a chat with my roommate about being a neurotic worrier. She mentioned that many days she just can't even go anywhere because little things worry her, such as whether or not New York City buses still take change, or if you have to have a metrocard. I said "that's the difference between you and me. I too am a neurotic worrier, but I use the internet to find answers. The internet is a wonderful thing."  For example, tomorrow I have to rent a car and drive to LaGuardia airport to pick up my mother, sister, and aunt. This trip makes me very nervous on many different levels, so I started researching it LAST WEEKEND--a full two weeks before I need to make the trip. After reserving my car online, I researched the terminal lists to find my family's airline, then looked at maps of the airport layout, driving circles, and parking lots. I looked up parking rates and hours. I looked for directions to the airport and investigated major highways and bridges, which led me to worrying about toll collections because I have no idea what the tolls are or if I will have enough $1 bills with me, or perhaps a fistful of quarters will do. So then I thought an EZ-Pass would be EZ-er so I looked up the Fast Lane stuff for MA (because I already have my non-refundable $27.50 transponder) to make sure it works in NYC and NJ toll booths, then called the Mass Pike people to see if I could re-activate my FastLane transponder, which they said I could, but the real problem is that it takes three days for it to become active in non-MA toll booths, which is NYC, which is precisely why I re-activated the stupid thing in the first place.  Me: "How will I know if it's working out-of-state? Can I check online or something?" FastLane guy: "We can't monitor the out-of-state activity. You just have to try it." Me: "So...to see if it's working I have to drive through an EZ-Pass lane and if it fails, I know it's not working? And then I get a ticket for blowing the toll?" FastLane guy: "Yes ma'am, that's correct." Me: "Did you just call me ma'am?"  The point is, I get very nervous when an answer is  not  on the internet. This is incomprehensible to me. It's unsettling. It's "destablizing." So lacking an online option, I decided instead to just check the weather again.  I have a sequence of websites that are all bookmarked for easy access. I will go through the list repeatedly if a) it's first thing in the morning b) it's just after lunch or c) I am really, really bored. The sequence is this: 1)  weather.com  (including relentless search for current 100 mile doppler reading) 1a) any Local Severe Weather Alerts on weather.com 2)  boston.com  2a) check price of RSA's stock to see whether all my options will still be completely WORTHLESS when I lose them Sept. 1 3)  ny1.com  4)  Petey B.  (Boston meteorologist who, when on duty, writes the funniest weather descriptions known to mankind. Props to K-dawg on this find.) 5) back to  urlLink weather.com  (to compare it to Petey B., of course) 6)  miami.com  to read the latest Dave Barry columns, which occur daily lately while he is at the Olympics 7) earthlink.net to check my email, if any 8)  urlLink weather.com  again, just in case it's changed in the last 4 minutes.  When I'm done, I usually send some silly email to my sister like "my nose is itchy" or "I like cheese" to which she responds "k." Then I get up and crack my back, sit down, and start all over again.

      Only a few--a very select few--have heard this story. I basically only told it to people I believed would in no way report it back to my grandmother, because upon hearing it, she will immediately believe that New York  IS  just like what she sees on NYPD Blue and Law & Order. (But Prill, I promise, I am unharmed and this is just an isolated case of a crazy New York pervert.)  Plus, I keep getting a reaction of "Why didn't you...." and I can only say, "Honestly, what would  you  have done?"  On a typical Friday afternoon, I left work with my co-worker, Erica, and we headed for the subway. A Friday afternoon subway ride in New York is comparable to a Friday afternoon commute to the Cape on Labor Day weekend: completely, indescribably overcrowded.  Erica and I boarded the train and were forcefully shoved in various directions by the 8,349 people behind us. My backpack (that I was holding in front of me) hit some lady in the ass, and she snapped her head around and shot a dirty look to whoever might be responsible. "Sorry," I said. "It's my bag." She smiled understandingly.  The doors chimed and tried to close as people's limbs reached through in an effort to get a place on the already completely overfilled train. Some squeezed on, and soon I couldn't move my arms or legs because of the crowd. I knew I couldn't reach over to hold on, but I also knew I didn't have to because even if we collided head on with another train and rolled over six times, I'd remain completely upright thanks to the sardine-packed effect of the passengers. I looked around for Erica, smiled, and without another word, I silently prayed that no one near me had B.O. or farted.  As we pulled away from the station, I became aware of the presence of some object in the vicinity of my ass. Knowing from experience this could be anything from a bicycle to a backpack to a four-year-old, I didn't really think much of it. The train continued to jerk and sway, and each time I felt a stronger presence of the object near my ass. I could not turn my head and look because I could not move, but I started to realize there was a distinct cupping action occurring and in all likelihood, there was a hand grazing my right butt cheek.  I decided to just ignore it. Incidental contact is just a way of life, and I figured the person probably didn't even know his hand was touching my ass, and maybe it wasn't even a hand afterall...  Wait. What's this? I begin to feel a slight tickle in the small of my back. I can't quite discern what would cause that sensation, and spend several long moments surveying my options. The tail or nose of a dog? Unlikely. The small innocent hand of a child unaware of its movement? Possible. Very very possible. So I chose to believe that behind me some little kid, tired and draped over her mommy's shoulder, was sucking her thumb, twirling her hair, and wiggling her toes, which were inadvertently finding the quarter-inch gap between my shirt and skirt and tickling my flesh.  Well, the "small child," realizing she could get away with this, decided to take things a step further. Next thing I know the intruder is on its way DOWN the back of my skirt. Every alarm in my head went off, and while I still could not rotate my head or body to see what was happening, I wrestled an arm free to reach behind me. Nothing was there. Whoever it was stopped. Irritated and disgusted, I pulled my shirt back down and brought my arm back in front of me.  Then it came back, its persistance and flexibility leading me to believe some pervert's finger was to blame. This time it tried going up the back of my shirt, and as I re-adjusted to reach behind me again, I imagined taking hold and literally breaking the hand of whoever I came in contact with. I debated yelling something over my shoulder, like "Get your filthy hands off my ass you dirty fucking pig" but due to the overcrowded nature of the train, and also to the fact that a lot of New Yorkers would not just stand by if someone was in trouble, I honestly feared that any commotion would result in someone getting hurt--smooshed against a wall or a rib cracked against a railing. So I said nothing, and as I reached behind me the pervert ceased. I left my hand there as protection, and looked frantically over my left shoulder, then my right, trying to see what asshole was behind me doing this. But I could see  nothing . I even looked in windows and people's eyeglasses to try to catch a reflection of the groper, but I could see absolutely nothing.  Now, bear in mind that this has all happened in less than one subway stop--9 short blocks, a total of maybe 45 seconds or a minute. As we approached the next stop, I prepared for a quick turnaround so I could see and/or attack whoever was doing this to me, but I couldn't move until some people got off and space became available.  The train stopped, the doors opened, and I snapped around to find a big empty space. Whoever he was, he was gone. Long gone.  At first I was horrified. I ran over to Erica and told her what happened. (It was the first time she got a taste of the "real Stephanie" complete with colorful descriptors that begin with the letter F.) Then I grew angry. Then I became amused. In the end, I'm irritated that this asshole got away with his pervy fondling, but I know that I'm not hurt, not scarred, and there will be no permanent damage.  And now when other people's bags hit me in the ass, I snap around and shoot them a dirty look until I know it's really just a bag, because god help the poor fool who I ever catch touching me with his hands. He'll be one dead, bruised, sorry mother fucker.

      I had an interesting conversation the other day with two brothers aged 21 and 22. We were sitting at the airport talking about the cleanliness of public restrooms. I said "You guys don't have to worry about a thing. You can get in and out without having to touch anything but yourselves. Girls have it a lot harder." They both started telling me that I must just be doing it wrong. Perplexed, I prompted them for more information.  Jordan: "I don't see what the problem is. Just put your ass on the seat." Me: "Ew! No way! Do you know how disgusting that is?" Jordan: "How bad can it really be?" Me: "People PISS on the seats! I don't want to sit in someone else's piss!" Jordan: "How do girls get piss on the seat?" Me: "By hovering." Jordan: "Okay, so put some toilet paper down first." Me: "That does no good. It just absorbs the piss so you sit on pissy toilet paper instead of a pissy seat. Same thing." Jordan: "Wow. That's gross. " Me: "Yes, it is. So we just perpetuate the pissiness by always having to hover." Jordan: "I don't understand hover." Nate: "It's like an isometric squat." Me: "Yes. Great for the quads and hamstrings." Jordan: "Don't you hold on to something?" Me: "No. The goal is to not touch  anything . Just hover."  Admittedly, though, hovering is not always my choice of position. It depends on whether a bathroom is public or semi-public, the difference being this:  public : a place where any uncalculable amount of complete strangers with varying hygiene use the can  semi-public : a place where a controlled, closed set of acquaintences with visible, discernable hygiene use the can For example, a bathroom at McDonalds is public. A bathroom at work is semi-public. Rest area: public. Birthday party at cousin's house: semi-public. You get the idea.  In public situations, by no means will my flesh touch the petri dish known as the toilet seat. Hovering is the only way to go to ensure that there is no contact with the germs, fungus, or droplets of piss on the seat. The toilet is then flushed by extending a foot to the handle and pushing. This is followed by a very thorough hand-washing with whatever soap may be available, and every attempt is made to open and close the main door with my feet.  In semi-public situations, I am often more trusting. I know or have passed in the halls the other people whose naked asses may or may not have grazed the toilet seats. I also make a habit of using the same stall every time, so as to reduce the number of foreign asses by increasing the number of my own. In these cases, a toilet seat paper provides sufficient separation and peace of mind.  But one must be quick and wise about using paper toilet seat covers. They come perforated but not separated, so small tugs must be made to tear the paper in the appropriate spots or the result will be much like the traditional teen (or Big Bri) prank of covering a toilet bowl with clear plastic wrap. Also, once the paper is laid on the seat, action must be taken quickly or the paper is likely to fall into the toilet itself, especially if any portion of it makes contact with and starts absorbing water. Paper toilet seat covers are no joke, and must be taken seriously.  In the end, the best preparation is to always have strong, well-developed quads, hamstrings, and abdominal muscles to perform the power squat. You never know when you're gonna need it.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to pee.

      For a long time now, a lot of you have been telling me to publish the crap that I write. I just smile and say "maybe someday." Well, let's call this a first step. I'm still not feeling motivated enough to work hard for the rejection of a publishing attempt, and this seems like a reasonable compromise. You can read it like you always did, but so can anyone else who is foolish enough to stumble upon it, completely by accident, most likely while looking for porn. I don't have too much to tell you about right now, but I can tell you yet another shoe story.  A couple of weeks ago I bought a pair of white Ralph Lauren Polo sneakers. They were $20, and struck me as the perfect shoe for my everyday walks to and from the subway station. I was sick of walking in heels, and flip-flops proved extremely treacherous in rainy weather--once they get wet they refuse to stay on my feet. So the new sneakers have been doing the trick for about two weeks now, and while a bright white new shoe isn't always the best compliment for my outfit, I don't friggin' care. My feet are comfortable and I don't fall in the holes of subway grates.  So this morning I left the house to find--big surprise--rain. I opened my umbrella and headed west. I crossed the street, and as I strolled down the sidewalk I started to notice a strange sound occurring at regular intervals behind me. It sounded something like the labored panting of a french bulldog, so I was surprised to turn around and see nothing. No one was near me. So by process of elimination, I knew the funny noise was coming from me.  I wasn't aware of any intenstinal problems I might have had from my dinner of popcorn and a hershey bar (I haven't been food shopping in a while), so after a bit of thought, I decided the noise was coming from my left foot. I was urked to realize it was the sound of air pushing through water, because it meant somewhere on my new shoe there was a hole.  I continued walking, trying all sorts of adjustments to my footfall. I put the weight on the outside of my foot, then the inside, then tried landing on just my toe. But I could not control the squishy wet fart noise coming from my heel. I avoided puddles, but before long, my suspicions were confirmed when a cool sense of wetness overcame my sock and heel.  Eventually I got to the subway where I stood still (and quiet) before charging with the masses at 33rd St. I went up the stairs, bought my $1 muffin from the morning vendor, crossed the street, and went up to my desk. I took off the shoe to find that all sorts of problems and wetness had ensued, and the shoe was actually beginning to disintegrate.  I'm not quite sure what to do about this, if anything. I mean, I bought the damn shoes particularly to replace flip-flops in raining weather. I suppose I could try to return them, but I don't know if that'll fly with whatever 19-year-old sales girl is just working for another week to save money before school starts (although, usually if I compliment their acrylic nails, they are much nicer to me, and may actually make eye contact while ringing up my purchase and talking on their cell phones). Really I expected more from Ralph Lauren, and I'm thinking about calling him directly. I saw him on Friends once, and he seemed like a nice guy. Maybe he'll help me.  In the end, I've just laid the sock out so it will dry before quitting time. Then I can have squishy wet shoe farts all the way home, and get ready to do it again tomorrow.

      **Rated N for No One Should Have to See This**  There are traumas in the park aside from scary, agressive pigeons. Take, for example, the very skinny man who just removed his pants to reveal a very tiny, tropical blue-colored banana hammock. (Translation: a revolting, far-too-revealing speedo usually worn only by uninhibited Europeans in South Beach.) But is that enough? Does it stop there? No.  Not only is he a very skinny man wearing nothing but a banana hammock, but the bulge is HUGE. Women and men all over the park are unable to keep their eyes from it. Small children are running from it. When he stands up, it hangs. When he lies on his back, it, well, doesn't. It's a nasty, scary lump right in the middle of the park--a mere 10 feet from me--and I can't stop staring. It's like driving by a car wreck. I  know  it's wrong to look but it's just there, demanding attention. But is that enough? Does it stop there?  When a break in the clouds finally offered some sunlight, Banana Hammock Man sat up, spread his legs wide, and began rubbing sun tan oil all over his body. Some poor woman, not three feet away, had a view centered perfectly between the man's legs, and no doubt got a truly disgusting view of the lubrication. I say "no doubt" because she, much like myself, could not conceal her fascination with said act, and stared blatently at the man--or his banana--the entire time.  Now she's gone, due entirely to her repulsion, and he lies there, legs still spread and glistening in the sun, as people walk by pointing and snickering, saying "that's just  wrong ." But me? I just sit nearby and write it all down.

      New York City pigeons are a little too bold for my liking. On a normal day, I must walk hurriedly past them—or be walked hurriedly past by them—on the sidewalks. They move for no man, woman, child, nor dog. They simply aren’t scared.  One day last week I saw a little boy, maybe three years old, chasing a pair of pigeons the way my sister did as a child. With his arms spread wide, face full of glee, he released a war cry and stormed at the birds, stamping his little feet as loudly as possible for maximum effect. The pigeons, undaunted by the boy’s close proximity, merely took a small step to the side the way you’d expect an expert bullfighter to do in the manner of taunting the bull, a rather teasing “na-na, you missed.” The little boy, defeated in his quest, turned to his mother, drew a deep breath, and started wailing. The birdies weren’t scared of little Timmy. Timmy will spend 10 years in therapy for his self-esteem. The pigeons screwed up Timmy.  Meanwhile, pigeons in flight are a much scarier encounter than those on the ground. Not only are they fearless—they’re aggressive. You can be minding your own business, walking down the street, trying not to be hit by buses, taxis, and bicycle delivery guys, when out of nowhere a pigeon dives, swoops, and buzzes your head. If you’re lucky, you’ll see them coming in enough time to duck, usually to the amusement of other people on the street who are in fact laughing because they too have been assaulted in such a manner. Other times, you can actually anticipate the dive-bomb, like when a man walks out of a Chinese restaurant with a plate of rice, and foolishly dumps it on the sidewalk with no regard to his nearby fellow humans. In this instance, you have two options: 1) take immediate cover, or 2) hit the deck. The beasts swoop in from all directions, and if you’re in their way, they’ll take you down. After the threat has passed, it is perfectly acceptable, if not expected, to go beat some sense into the man who dumped the rice.  There are still some situations, however, in which no person can predict, prepare, or protect against the uprising of the pigeons. For example, as you lie nearly asleep on a blanket in the tranquil park, you may have no idea that a beady-eyed predator is about to peck off your baby toe. Or if you stop your weary legs to rest on a bench, you may not realize you happen to be seated near a favorite pigeon landing site, and may soon find yourself in a territorial face-off that you will, in all likelihood, lose in an attempt to keep your eyeballs from being pecked out.  So when you’re walking around trying not to get run over, mugged, or assaulted, just remember to keep one eye on the sky. The real danger comes from above.
