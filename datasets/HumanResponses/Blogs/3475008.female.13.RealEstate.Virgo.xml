      im sitting in my fathers office and doing absolutely nothing. doesnt that sound like joyous fun? anyway, i got to leave school early, so i guess that was ok. leaving school early on a half day...hmmm, never heard of that one before. we only had club left, which wasnt really club, but whatevs. then wewent to bandito's to meet with the guy whos rebuilding our house. if u dont already know, which most of yah do, my house caught fire last summer and they havent really started the rebuilding yet. its okay cause we're SO much closer to everything now instead of being like 20 minutes away. and the development (alexan farms, which is like right next to garret farms) has its own pool, so thats cool. okay, i was listening ot g105 and it pisses me off that they play the same thing over and over again. anyway, thats old, cause everybody says that...oh yah, never talk about the song "my immortal" cause it makes we wanna barf. evanescence is so goth. yet so popular...sigh....what has the world come too? im not saying there anything wrong with goth, goth's okay, just not the music. especially evanescence, which ive already let u know. i feel very accomplished today. well, i guess so. i finished that stupid portfolio. ms joyner was like, "you have had two full weeks to do this (actually we've only had like one week and a half, but ok)" whine whine whine. im gonna go tell that guy next to my dads office ot stop blasting jazz music. god, at least find something better to listen to. god! (just kidding)

      well, today started with the daily unwelcomed awakening from my mother at like 6 in the moring, okay, maybe not that early, but oh well....i dont really get why we have to go to school so early in the morning. i mean. havent sudies shown that kids need much more sleep than they really get? and teachers give us way too much homework and make us stay up late (not that i mind that, as long as im around the computer). but whatevs...anyway, im totally excited about today being the last full day of school. god, im gonna miss that place....ahem..cough, cough. yah, right. i mean, its  not that i dont like school...well, yes it is. i really only like it for the uneducational part but who doesnt? ok, yah know what really annoys the crap outta me? mary-kate and ashley marathons. they're on all the time and its starting ot get on my nerves. i guess its not that bad, cuz its only on abc family, but seriously. they're on like every minor holiday. i cant wait till memorial day becasue of the mary-kate and ashley marathons!! woohoo. well, im gonna end this spaz and go get some food. tata *k*
