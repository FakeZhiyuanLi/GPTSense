      Cho I fear I have little in my possession that will interest you so I shall leave you what I've loved most of all. I give you my gold and jewels. Although you find little use for them-they has been the dearest and strongest driving force in my life. I have no request for you Cho. You were so kind to me in my life there is nothing I can ask of you in death. Thank you, Cho Yo Fay.

      Taleena, this goes against my better judgment, but in heart I know you could do well with my things. I leave to you my beloved lockpick, my rogue's tools, my starry night armor and my Handy Haversack. Use them well. May no lock ever keep you from a better life. My last request to you is this: never throw a dagger at the halfling again.

      &nbsp;Dear Janna, as a show of friendship I leave to you my Nagahide boots of seduction. May they serve you as well as many others for years to come. I also leave you my beautiful circlet of intelligence.&nbsp; My last request to you is this: please know that I never blamed you for Adam Moses death- yet I credit you with his freedom.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To you Grish, I leave my Bag of Holding. Perhaps it will serve you well. I leave my shares of the Gelhilde to you as well. Please, also&nbsp;take any potions you feel may be useful.&nbsp; My last small request to you is this: please say one truly nice thing about me. Aloud. That is all I ask.  &nbsp;  ~Nin

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seph, you shall have my Glove of Storing, my Willow Wisp Mask, all my jewelry, "Slate" my horse and writing materials. You need only snap your fingers and the glove shall hold your treasures. It looks plain but I dare say you shall never find it lacking. Please don't let my horse be made into a coat. As my last request to you, I ask that you write a ballad honoring me and sing it aloud some day.&nbsp; &nbsp; ~Nin

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ozreal, in the event of my death I leave to you my "thunder sticks", that is three guns, two dueling pistols and one daranger gun along with all of my gun powder. They are silent when fired, so they won't disturb your precious nature. Enjoy them. Perhaps you will prove a better shot than I.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my last request from you, I ask that you try to bring me back once more. Be assured I don't want to be dead. That is my last request to you.  &nbsp;  ~Nin

       &nbsp; To Whom It May Concern,      &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon my death, after resurrection and reincarnation attempts have failed, the noted items shall be divided among the party as stated in this will.&nbsp; It should be noted that each recipient will also be called upon for one last request, should this small favor be denied me the recipient does not receive their item. If I am maliciously (not accidentally) murdered by one of my companions no one receives anything and all my possessions shall be cast into the nearest body of water along with my remains.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let this one thing be known as well; never have I known peace or contentment. Until I came to fight along side my companions. Live on.     &nbsp;   ~Nin

      Dear Aldeberan,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may be the last letter I write to you. We have made our way to Shonay. In this forsaken land I may very well loose my life. The penalty here for stealing is death. Instant death. My will is not as strong as it once was. I have become afraid of myself. I yearn to sharpen my skills but dare not as these people deem women of a lesser quality than men. I hate it here in this queer land. I long to return to the land I know, where crime is punishable by imprisonment which is quite escapable for me.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I should be able to keep my hands in my own pockets still I may not live to see you again. Upon more research we have discovered the dragon we are to face is utterly unbeatable.&nbsp; Never have I dreaded tomorrow as I do now. If I escape death, I fear I will only live to see my companions loose their lives. And yet a small comfort to me is the knowledge that a pearl lies within the head of our dragon. Should we slay it surly it would be our treasure. Mmmm, sweet treasure in the hands, like chocolate on the tongue. So satisfying, yet you never have enough.  Fare well, Aldeberan.  &nbsp;  ~Nin

      Nin carefully opened her trunk and placed the shrieking shrub Ozreal had given her inside then quickly shut the lid. As she reset the trap she smiled to herself as she pictured the slave trying to open it. "Yeah lets see you try that shit now!", she thought to herself. She felt her muscles tense when she remembered the accusations Seph had thrown out about Taleena being her sister. "If she was my sister I'd have to throw myself off the side of the boat. No-better yet- I'd throw her off the boat. Hehehe." She took out the writing set she had bought in Shonay and began writing a letter. "Stupid Taleena." she thought. She lifted her quill:  Dear Aldebearn ....

      Dear Aldeberan,        I find myself in Shonay. This land is both a blessing and a curse. It seems no matter where we go or what we do someone wants us dead. They always want us dead, Aldeberan. I'm beginning to take it personally.       I was delighted to receive your letter. I am bothered to hear of the trouble with the Robber Barony. I am even more bothered to hear Sinith Falco is now in charge of the construction in Wayfare. Shall I recognize the town when I finally make it home? Or shall the flashing lights and whistles coming from the various structures disguise it too well? I jest. Sinith is a mysterious and capable gnome if ever I've met one. I digress. Please take care and watch your back. I should be much aggrieved if I learned of misfortune befalling you.      Perhaps it is myself whom should be the cautious one. Tonight I stayed in the castle here in Yakashima to protect the Damiyo and was met by a person they call a ninja. Have you heard of this before? Someone whom has the skill of stealth and deadly cunning they aim at their chosen target? I fancy I have a lot in common with them. Except that they are vile people and I am not. Although we overcame this ninja, her partner, another ninja, managed to kill the new Damiyo. Mores the pity. He seemed nice.      I must report my intentions to you Aldeberan. I plan to follow the rest of my companions in pursuit of a dragon here in Shonay to acquire the companion sword to that monstrous weapon Grish Yark carries. I seems he will never be at peace until he accomplishes this task. I confess I feel mild apprehension since the last time I faced a dragon I fell short of what would be considered successful. Death doesn't suit me.       Janna has been warned.      I wish to be included in any plans you may have concerning the House of Shandalar, however I do not expect you to wait for me since I cannot foresee a day when I will return to Wayfare. I long to. I wish for a quiet night in my own room at your inn, the Lonely Oak, with mead, a hot bath, and no one whom wishes to kill me.   Until then,  Nin

      Dear Al,       We humiliated an army of Sehaguan warriors that were led by an evil sea demon. HUMILIATED!! 150 strong they were! I didn't get a scratch! Their little Sehaguan God in the sea must be whimpering with disappointment and embarrassment! Hah! Serves 'em right! The taste of victory is delicious!  ~Nin

      Dear Aldeberan Timgarn, Year of the Owl   Life at sea doesn't suit me. There are only a limited number of gullible people on this ship and if anything goes missing I'm the first one they look to for answers. I'm not the only thief on this ship. The new one, Taleena, she's a thief if ever I've seen one. Shifty eyes, fast hands, tight lipped. Yeah, she's a thief. And to think I offered to teach her some things. Do you know she had the nerve to turn me down! That pitiful little wafe denied a master thief like myself! I'm astounded! I expected better from a wood elf. I trust her as far as the halfling can throw her! Be assured I'm going to keep my eye on her. For now I must content myself with the few card games I can rustle up and the occasional bet with Janna. I like her. She's reckless and loyal. Much like myself. There is nothing I wouldn't do for anyone in our party, except for that little strumpet, Taleena. But I digress. I'm writing to you not to complain about that conniving slave, but to seek answers. I've learned that the first mate of this ship, a man named Swan, is the son of one of your associates from the past. What do you chance to tell me of him? Is he trustworthy? Often our lives are in his hands. I must know.   ~Nin

      Dear Aldeberan,                        Timgarn, Year of the Owl       We have two new members to our party as of late, Ozreal Muddlefoots and Taleena Greenbough. Oz is the most interesting halfling I've ever known. He's one of those nature lovers like gong Gong Guri. He must have low self esteem because he keeps changing his appearance. One moment he's a halfling the next he's a sparrow and then a wolf. Once I saw him change into a giant octopus! He also has little use for money which I've warned him about. He is a very brave little fellow- sent to watch over us by Gong.      The other, Taleena, is a slave. Or was. Adam Moses bought her. I think mainly to have someone to convert. But now that he's dead she's free. Poor thing. She seems hardly able to deal with freedom. I have a mind to take her under my wing and teach her what real freedom is. I have many "bad habits" I would be delighted to teach her. I must work on this.      Since there is little else for me to do at sea, I shall see if I can't get a good game of cards going. I could use the gold. Shrikes Point can't be too far away.   ~Nin

      Dear Aldeberan, Timgarn, Year of the Owl    It seems my companions have once again gotten into trouble. Please believe I had no hand in this. It came about like this: A man named Lord Raymond Chandilar accosted us upon pulling into port i Scarbourough. He claimed the Romy as his rightful property and attempted to take possession of our ship. He claimed the dwarf that gave us the ship had aquired it illegally and therefore had no right to give it away. This, of course, I'm sure is true but it was much easier to kill Chandilar than going through the proper legal channels-an I'm sure you know. I shall skip the account of his death, our arrest, imprisonment, battle and return to the ship to save time, sufice to say the death of Lord Chandilar was legal due to his own folly. Grish Yark, I'm sure you remember him, had the forethought to have Chandilar sign an official dueling document. Grish, of course, came out the winner. As for the cleric and other men that were with him they deserved their deaths. Unfortunatly we didn't have time to kill Lord Raymond Chandilars son, Alec, for he jumped a battle ship and took to sea swearing his vengence on us for his fathers death. Aldeberan, this is where I require your help. I must know everything you know about Raymond and Alec Chandilar, Earls of Ramswold. Surely some of our "assosiates" will be able to learn how dangerous this man is.  From here we make our way to Shrikes Point,then Woo. Follow the trail of dead bodies-I'm sure you'll find us. I'll send word of future plans. Please haste your response and news of the impending battle in Scarborough.   Thankfully,  Nin
