      It's currently 3:30 in the morning, I'm coffeeless and lazy but not ready to drift off into dreamland.  Actually, I'm reading through my old Boiling Springs friend's  Xanga  sites, and they're tossing me into a depression.  Nothing serious, so please don't fret, but I just feel like I'm some guy sitting on the side of the road.  Someone with no direction or goal, and I see this bus go by full with these people I once knew well.  I sit there and look at them and I know what they've been up to, but I can't relate.  I'm too far away, there is a glass ceiling, something I'll never get through.  The glass ceiling could be college, could be the fact that I really havn't done anything good this summer, or maybe it's just that I think of myself subconciously as a bad person and would do anything to get back what I once had with those friends.  Who knows, I might someday if I think about it enough, but I'm not a fan of that.  I just want direction, motivation, and something to look forward to that will eventually leave me satisfied.   3:36 am...  You know what happiness is to me?  Real, true friends that will never leave me, a girl I can trust and be with happily, and an idea of what my career will be someday.  The girl is something that I could do without, but it's just been so long since I've had someone to be intimate with that I'd appreciate it a lot.  True friends, though, are hard to come by, and I used to have many, but now all I see are friends with true potential.  These potentially true friends are all going to disappear thanks to college, or graduation, or whatever you want to call it.  Some of them are already gone and I can't do a damn thing about it.  I think I need to go for a walk.  Hard times these are, hard times.  3:40 am...  I need to work out, get myself in better shape, and maybe then I'll feel better about myself.  I need direction.  I think I can manage meeting life-long friends and such if I just have some direction.  Motivation too, that ties in with direction.  Basically, I'd really appreciate it if I could figure out some kind of goal for myself.  If I don't have direction, I'm not really appealing to anyone, or atleast I wouldn't find myself to be.  The day I look in the mirror and say, "Hey, I'd date you," is the day I think I'd be fully confident in myself.  I have confidence in some things, so don't get me wrong, but I also know limitations and occasionally cower from those.  We all have our battles, I just hate dealing with mine alone.  Especially when the battle is one where I'm trying to find the "true."  The true friends I want, the true girl, and the true goals.  I guess I need to look at myself and envision what I want to be.  We'll see...  3:45 am...  Time to step outside, think for a few minutes, and join the bed bugs.  Ciao.

      Welcome one and all to the new blog!  With  Club Beatnik  being revamped in a more professional style, it leaves no room for my blog, so I am moving it here.  I doubt there will be as many views, but for those who enjoyed reading it, I'll try not to let you down...  Today I was woken up at eleven in the morning, two hours before I usually drift out of unconsciousness, because my dad found a kitty who was blind in our backyard.  We later found out there were two that had been living in our run-down blue shed, and the blind one just happened to walk out of a hole in the side that I made playing soccer.  Actually, I should correct myself, the cat wasn't blind but instead had something keeping it's eyes shut.  I grabbed a cardboard beer box that held my dad's booze, I emptied it in our fridge, and took it outside to house the kitty.  We didn't find the second one until my sister came home and went looking around the yard and neighborhood with her friends.  I got bored and watched  Scarface  then left to hang out with some old Boiling Springs friends.  Came home and the cats were all gone.  If you're interested in adopting a kitty, check in with the Humane Society, the ones there are adorable.  Anyway, I'm going to talk about culture now.  Our desensitized culture is the only thing this generation has besides gratuitous sex, and even that isn't a new thing.  Beatniks, hippies, etc.  They all had sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  We have the same drugs, the same sex, just a few things to add to it all.  Plastic surgery allows people to like the way they look, getting rid of the genetic look that is traditionally passed down by the parents.  Rock and roll lovers decrease and die out as the wiggers and rap crap drift in, telling everyone they ain't nothing without they hoes and dah bling bling.  So the rap subconsciously makes society stupider, the druggies lose their "hippie peace" reputation for a "lost and misguided youth" rep, and divorce rates are skyrocketing.    Know what is the primary cause of divorce?  The militant feminists I'd say.  Trying to surpass the male populace for the sole reason of vengeance on the penis!  This brought about Title IX, which would have been cool had it not caused every other person in the U.S. to stomp on white men.  So with all these females trying to  be  men instead of being female and  equal  with men(which would have been the right way to go), we end up with single people making marriage like a prolonged date.  Sure there are other factors, and I'm not saying all females or feminists are the cause, just the extremely militant ones.    Well, this is my opinion after seventeen years of living, and anyone is free to disagree or make a point that I missed or something along those lines.  It's the United States of America, we have our obscured freedom of speech, so exercise it!  Ciao.

      Just woke up today, and I want to do something constructive.  I need to get my mind together, because when everything works out and begins to make sense, that day will kick massive quantities of round ass.  I think everyone can agree that when life makes sense it is a whole lot easier.  Not that I'm sitting here in a cloud of confusion or anything, but I just have so many thoughts that remain unanswered or incomplete in my mind.  So lazy... but I'm eating toast.  I was learning how to play some songs last night, like  Under the Bridge  by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and  Black Dog  by Led Zeppelin.  I cannot play the whole song, mind you, but just the introductions for now.  Hmm, so I think I might try and write an entire song today.  I really need to work on that, and I really need to get guitar lessons as well.  I am willing to practice night and day, through the screaming of the blood relatives trying to claw their way through my door at three in the morning.  Yes, I think this is what we call passion.  Hmm... I wonder a lot about college.  I wonder what I will major in, because I love music but not many people love the music I do, especially not many colleges.  You see, I'd love be a metalhead guitar master but where do you learn to do that besides on your own?  I wouldn't mind playing trumpet somewhere, or jazz piano, or even bass or drums in a band, but I think I'm in love with guitar.  I don't want to be someone who says they know how to play guitar because they know three chords and the introduction to  Stairway to Heaven .  I want to say I know how to play guitar because I get paid to play it.  The difference is simple, someone says you're good opposed to you trying to convince yourself you're musical.  Getting hit by Reality is like getting hit by a golden brick wrapped in lemon(Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams).    I was watching T.V. for the first time in a while, and I realize why I stopped.  I hate it.  It sucks, and it brainwashes people.  Well, most shows.  Sitcoms and cartoons and such are ok for now, but I'm sure some day they will become corrupt too.  Ugh... I really hope that if I move to Europe the world will seem less corrupt.  I just hope it's a United States thing.  We are, after all, the most arrogant country.  We flaunt our military power, call ourselves Americans when in reality Canadians, Brazilians, and Chileans are all Americans!  They're all part of the Americas, the whole Western Hemisphere of the world.  Of course, we just declare ourselves the only Americans out there.  How many of us would go to South America and actually see fellow Americans there?  How many of us would go to Africa and say, "Look at all the minorities!"  Heh, venting always feels good.  Anyway, that's enough of that.  I think I might go see a movie tonight, King Arthur is out.  Ciao.

      Today is July fourth, the day our fine country obtained its freedom from those evil Redcoats.  Today I woke up after getting three hours of sleep so I could go to church and ask God what's been happening.  I barely knew what was going on in my semi-concious state, and it didn't help that we had a guest priest from Boston.  I couldn't get the movie  Boondock Saints  out of my head past that, which made the time fly past me.    Behind me usually sat a family of five:  A mother, a father, and three daughters.  Today one daughter was missing, and she was an identical twin of one of the other daughters.  Weird eh?  I thought it was pretty neat, so when I sat down(before Boston and Boondock Saints and such infiltrated my mind) I noted that and wondered where the other twin was hiding.  I still don't know because I'm too shy to approach anyone in church, it just seems like something you do outside the House of God.  Anyway...  When I got home I slept until lunch time, which consisted of sausage... mmmm... Then I retreated back upstairs into my room where I sat playing videogames and watching the most exciting thing ever, golf.  After a few hours I ate dinner and called Chris.  Chris and I called Clinton and we contacted Ryan M. who drove us to set off fireworks in a field.  That was my day, because here I am writing this blog entry.  You know, I have friends, I have music, I have art, I have everything I think I could really want and yet there is something that leaves me unfulfilled.  Something there that keeps me from being totally and completely happy with life, and I'm not sure what that is right now.  I've been thinking about it a lot lately, which is why I've been such a reclusive guy, and I really have no idea.  I guess time will unravel it for me?  Who knows, but until then all I can do is try to live my last summer as a high school kid as best as I possibly can.  Ciao.

      If anyone has ever heard of Edguy, a Swedish power metal band, or Dragonforce, the worlds fastest power metal band(and possibly fastest, period), then you know how amazing these musicians truly are and respect them the way they should be respected.  Their career doesn't revolve around plastic boobs and cheesy love lyrics sung by someone in need of digital, vocal touch-ups.  They have passion and it shows.  I seriously suggest that any avid rock listener who is willing to expand their horizons across the Atlantic should definitely purchase a CD by one of the following bands: Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Edguy, Dragonforce, Evergrey, Falconer, Firewind, Hammerfall, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Thunderstone, Gamma Ray, Nevermore, etc. Their talent is beyond any pop star or mainstream rocker out there.  So anyway, it has been a while since I've really written anything, and I think that is because I've been out almost every night since my last post doing something with friends.  I've also been waiting to get some new guitar strings... I really hate the B string(just because it seems to break the most) but have managed to bum around in 'drop d' and bide my time.  It basically just means no soloing.  *sniffle*  The one thing I can do somewhat decently!  Haha.  Speaking of guitar, I am supposed to teach this girl I've never met in person how to play.  Her name is Donna, and she seems to really want to learn, so I might as well.  Never know, maybe Synthatonic will need a rhythm guitar in the future?    My dad had a talk with me, and I should really begin to gather applications for college.  The bad thing is that I've not even taken the SATs once.  Just PSATs.  I could be screwed over, but I still have some time.  I hate last minute things but sometimes it is a must.  Then again, if it is last minute it never usually bothers me.  I was looking at Boston College, NYU, Rochester(mainly because my dad mentions it all the time), and of course Dickinson.  NYU looks a little too difficult, as does Boston College, so Dickinson is my best bet right now.  I don't know if I want to leave state.  If I ever need financial help or something like that and I was at Dickinson I could always drive five miles and be home.  Then again, if I get in trouble it is almost guaranteed my parents will know, and there would be more pressure on me to do well.  I really don't know what to do... if anyone has any comments please post them.  As simple and menial as it may sound, comments make me happy.  Simple pleasures in life I suppose.  That's about all that has been happening, truthfully.  I've had writers block when I have tried to write lyrics to the songs I write, so if I could get over that maybe my band will have the CD out soon.  Speaking of the band, I should look for a keyboardist.  Maybe Ryan Ammerman(sp?) because I know he loves Stratovarius and I know he plays keys.  Who knows?  We'll see, but for now, I'm off to sleep or eat or something.  Ciao.
