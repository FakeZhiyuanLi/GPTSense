      That is the pending question of the day?  When will it?  I'm not sure.  Cress and I starting a plan.  July 1st. "D" day.  When we put on lives back on track. ( who knows how long that will last with the 2 of us) but hey at least it is a small goal.  Today anyway is finally over, now it is time to sit in traffic and try to make it home at a decent hour without going totally insane at the other drivers on the road.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day........

      So the one lesson that was learned over the weekend is that it is not OK to do a lwn job on your friends lawn, even if her tennage brother says it is ok...  Why do we go through life at times not taking other peoples feelings into consideration?  Is that because we are rasied in a selfish society???  Anyway back to the fun stuff, just one question who crashes a wedding in flip flops and jeans..  Is that normal?  Cress , Abby??  Comments. So 2 more days left in my Berkley home and then off to Royal oak for a life alone.  How Pathetic!!  Hopefully the move wont be too bad and I am super excited for my first couch and love seat to deliver.   Quote of the Day.....   .  "It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there is always room for a couple of beers.‚Äù

      So today at our Branch meeting little ole me was named employee of the month.  It kind of bites you in the ass since 3 days earlier you had just snapped at your boss who nominated you.  Whoops, insert foot into mouth.  Whatever I get a plaque and a parking spot.  YIPPY.  I'll just put that plaque next to the other one I have collecting dust.  So My last night excitement was the MALL.  Oh how I missed it.  I did some damage, but got some cute lime green shoes that I am very excited to wear.  This weekend should be interesting with cress moving home and me packing the rest of my past 2 years in Berkley.  Tear Tear...

      I'm on the edge of snapping and its not going to be pretty.  When is enough enough?  You are pulled in every which direction and thats just not good enough.  There comes a point when you can't do anymore, but when is that recognized?  I think working 12/13 hours a day should be good enough, some don't agree particularly my supiors.  My hair is falling out, I don't eat and I am about to have a breakdown.  Is that Healthy?    Quote of the day:  THE REAL MEANING OF LIFE  "Life is all about ass...either you are covering it, kicking it, kissing it, or trying to get it."

      So this past weekend was pretty much a flop.  I'm sick of being sick and worn down with no engery to do anything.  Saturday I was brilliant enough to lay out in the cold in capris pants without sunblock to get a lovely burn from my shins down to my feet.  Yup that looks HOT.  Somtimes I am not a thinker.  Today I finally got a hold of the annoying lady at the apartment complex.  You would think they would want to return your calls to make money and rent apartments.  Not this place.  Where am I living again..  O yes the RO.  Love it.  Life is wonderful!!  ( do you sense the sarcasm... )

      So after an exhausting and annoying day at work on Monday I arrive home to a lovely notice from the City of Berkley.  VIOLATION big and bold on the front of the envelope.  So I guess my city only picks up lawn debris at the end of april and beginning of May.  Not that I would know cause I don't do outdoor work.  ( like I would get dirt under my nails)  But to sum things up my roommate decided to leave 2 bags that are now distroyed with the debris coming out on the curb for umm the past 2 months.  LOVE IT.  The best part she called the city last week and they told her they weren't picking up anymore.  Gee I wonder why we got the citation.  I love adulthood....

      At what age does reality set in that it is not OK to act like you are 21 and play wine pass in the parkling lot of a BW3?  I tend to think that we are fight the fact that we are getting older, by still acting as if we are fearless and out of control as we did in college.  When does it come to the point that this isn't acceptable anymore?  Who cares I'm having fun..  Here are the top 10 highlights from this past weekend.  10.  Rocko excaping again in Granda Plaza, thank goodness for the quick Brit. 9.  Hot girl check in...95.5 8.  Wine Pass  7.  Cress getting busted at the POST.  Enough said. 6.  The DJ taking his pants off in the DJ both - Yes you girls missed that one. 5.  Abby and tons of  PDA ...  AHHH  4.  The Student - he is only 21 3.  The canadian's friends are here.  Where is the Canadian? 2.  Calling the radio station because you are with a person from another country.   1.  Clinque compact all over the car.  Whoops.  PS.  I have decided that outdoor woods OFF doesn't really work considering my feet are covered in bite.  itchy itchy.

      Why is it when you don't want to participate in something because you are already over worked you are magically volunteered?  Sometimes I think that you are pushed and pushed just to see how much you can take before you beat your head so hard on your desk that you pass out..  Yup, that pretty much sums up my day.   The latest work team that I have been assigned to is the "customer service team".  Oh boy what fun.  Just because I put crane rentals on my credit card and assist customers with HOT shipments at 2:30am, doesn't mean that I want to be a role model for other employees and mentor them on hoe to provide exceptional customer service that you don't get compensated for or even recognized for.    Life goes on I guess.  When will the weekend come?????

      Why does growing up mean making huge financial decisions?  This past weekend I felt the need to make one of those "Big Purchases" and buy new couches.  Even though I have yet to sign a lease on an apartment to put them in.  This sort of thing always makes me nervous in whether I am making the correct decision vs. buying on impulse?  More often then not I chose the impulse route.  Is that wrong?

      So I went to my favorite relaxation place last night, yes that is right the SALON.  Oh how i love to get my head rubbed.  So after a wonderful glass of wine and the june INSTYLE, I am super Blonde.  One might say "Jessica Simpson Blonde"  Love it. But now back in reality I had another stupid day in the real not so fun world.  Do you ever feel like all you do is work, work, work and never really finsih anything?  I'm really starting to think it is over-rated.  Wait I have thought that for awhile now.  Well tomorrow is Friday and that means I get to think that I am 21 again and have some fun.

      So this lovely holiday weekend started out with a little trip to what I like to call the " CITY " .  Oh how I love an after school special that takes place at the town Pump... Anyone for pole sliding at the local Detroit fire station.   And of course the night couldn't be complete without a trip to our fav spot in the Clemn.  I think the night could of been perfect without the flying pizza at my Ass...  ( next time I am sitting in a car can we not throw pizza at someone's face)  Saturday was a whole another day with little shopping to start things out.  Of course we headed out to the POST for the night.  Cress ditched us for someone better.  whatever.  Obviously the girls did too many shots that night causing them to "SWELL" so I couldn't fit in the car to get home. Darn  my favorite quote of the night.  "Can I get you anything, diet coke, food, a condom"  Where was I???  I love U rams horn..  Yes a random sampling of food is wonderful for a drunken morning.  Nothing like working off the food with a little R&B with aunt Deb.  We are not going to talk about my wiping out incident.  Yes I am a professional..   Nothing like watching the game ( or pretending to watch the game) at BW3.  Boneless wings not so good...

        So this past weekend I was able to discover what first class was all about.&nbsp; My new best friend at Northwest Jesse decided that cress and I were cute enough girls that we sould ride first class and decided to upgrade us.&nbsp; boy what a life.&nbsp; I was the happiest girl for the whole 1.5 hours of a trip from Knoxville.&nbsp; I guess you have to take what you can get.&nbsp;     Today I was also awarded with 250 shares of stock options.&nbsp; Yes that is my company's way of keeping you wrapped into the company.&nbsp; You can't touch these shares for 5 years.&nbsp; OUCH.&nbsp; But its a nice gesture and it gets your mind off you low salary for a whole 5 minutes....    Its hard enough for me to imagine my life 1 year from now and they want me to committ for at least 5 years...&nbsp; Who do they think I am someone with goals and a projected planed out future???&nbsp; Yikes maybe it is a hint that I need some realiziation of who, what and where I want to be.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Goal for the month...&nbsp; Who, what, and where do I want to be?

      This week I have been stretched in so many different directions I'm wondering whether I am gumby or his sidekick the ASS?&nbsp; I'm concluding that I am the Ass for letting myself be taken advantage of so often at this wonderful place of my employment.&nbsp; I love working 3 departments at once and not getting compensated for it.&nbsp;  My life has become pretty pathetic again..&nbsp; Between working, baby showers, weddings, and bachelorette parties I haven't had time to find one..I think I should take out an ad..  " Life Wanted... Cute, blond career women seeking exciting life with benefits, please call with referrals"    I wonder if I will get any calls....&nbsp;

       So what makes us at the age of 24/25&nbsp; feel the need to go out every weekend spending every bit of extra money we might have on alcohol?&nbsp; Or for that matter find that it is cool to hang out at a over 40's bar and get free drinks?&nbsp; ( perhaps it is that whole free drinks part).&nbsp; So Friday started off with a trip to the RO where we met TJ.&nbsp; TJ was very entertaining and did offer to help dry me off after the incident of my drink in my crouch...&nbsp; (Anyone ever heard of TIPS Training?&nbsp; Obviously TJ did not)  ***Cress it really wasn't that funny.&nbsp; ****  Off to GRR for the lovely bachlorette party, I will admit I wasn't too excited about it at first but it was a grand ole time.&nbsp; Nothing like reinacting the good ole college days of drinking and finishing the night off binge eating at 3am.&nbsp; Oh yeah I missed the eating part.&nbsp; When did the pizza come?&nbsp; Where is Dacia??&nbsp; How old was he anyway?&nbsp; I am sorry to say that I was expecting to see a little pleather worn, but surprising enough I thought wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So tonight is my first adventure to the laundry mat and I'm not too excited as it is not typically my kind of place.  We all know how I feel about not so clean places that have scary people there.  YIKES!! I do need my cute bar jeans for this weekend for the fab time in GRR.  I made my first tuna noodle salad last night with a bunch of randomness that was in my fridge.  It actually turned out to be extremely good.  I am very proud of myself.  Laugh if you want, but I rock!!

      Well that is a new one for me.  Who would of thought.  I guess I was a wee bit out of control or so some people thought on Saturday.  I of course think differently.  Its not my fault that I am so desirable.  hehe.  Nothing like playing last one to the car loses for who has to drive home, once again that probably wasn't the best option especially when the valet was like you need a driver and everyone yells "NOT IT"  Anyone seen Liz??  Oh yeah she is right next to me, no need to use the cell...    Counting Crows - Love them, but could the play list be anymore depressing.  Is Adam back in therapy??    Well back to another wonderful day at work, Oh how I love it so.  Why can't I find a wealthy man to take care of me?  Mission for next weekend....

      So the weekend started early on Thursday with "the Move".  It was interesting to say the least.  Only one item was thrown from the truck into the middle of Thirteen mile, but thanks to Cressie it was salvaged.  Felicity was the other obstacle she didn't want to move..  After a few chases and a few cuts (why didn't any of my freights do an intervention..I'm a cutter) she was shoved into the car...  The move was finished off by popping the cork on the gallon of Asti.  Love it.    Friday started out as a day by the pool, but not with out some mango passion wine coolers courtesy of Deanna.  YUM!!  Then we were off to the Post of course for the Mt. Clemens fire works.  Oh Aw..  Not really, I think the bar was a little over capacity.  Nothing too exciting expect for Courtney puking out of cressie's car.  ( how many is that now )  Saturday we were off to Jack's with Aunt Deb..  I really don't think that she likes hanging out with us.  Oh do we want to talk about how I am obsessed with text messaging.  Yup that is how my night ended.  1.5 hours of dirty talk via Text.    I love to BBQ and do the Shimmy..  Sunday - Happy 4th, with a drunken BBQ, Shimmy, and Mr. B's and of course some more text messaging.  yes I need a life.

      Well I can tell you considering I landed myself an additional watch this weekend.. hehe. So why is it that it is OK for guys to come and go in and out of our lives as they please. Why do we let them? Is it because I am a single girl who lives with her cat.. Typical sterotype ( I hate it) I guess the one good thing is that I HAVE THE WATCH!!! I als enjoyed a fabulous outing to Grand Blanc this weekend for a Wedding. It was a very nice wedding except for the bug bites that I now have all over me.. OUCH!!! It is scary that all my friends are now getting married and I can't even get a date. Well one that I want anyway. Well hopefully it will get better soon. I can't see it getting any worse.. I hope.....
