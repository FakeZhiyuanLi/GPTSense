           I feel bad for this guy. This is why America's tightening up on security, y'all should too...   JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African radio reporter went a little more live than anticipated on Tuesday when he was mugged on air for his cellphone.  Regan Thaw of the Johannesburg area Talk Radio 702 was about to deliver an on-site report from a local squatter settlement when one of the locals pulled a gun on him.   "I asked him a question but got no response, I just heard shuffling and muffled voices in the background," said 702 news editor Katy Katopodis, who was on air with Thaw at the time.  "He had a gun held to his head and he was told 'give me your phone' ... (the man) threatened to kill Regan if he didn't hand over the phone and his belongings."  Thaw complied and the show went on -- without his report.  The on-air mugging was rare even for South Africa, which has one of the highest crime rates in the world. But Katopodis said it was not altogether unprecedented.  "The exact same thing has happened to me five years ago. I was held up at gunpoint while doing an interview," she said.   That'd be quite embarassing. I won't go as far as to ask what race this mugger might be...

      I've been off on posting lately, due to getting "PWN3D" by my dad, who cut off my internet privileges. Luckily, I've been able to get to our library, where I can make a post with a little bit of free time... check out this "OWNAGE"   Man Jailed for Shooting Off His Testicles  Tue Jul 13, 1:06 PM ET  LONDON (Reuters) - A British man who accidentally shot himself in the testicles after drinking 15 pints of beer was jailed for five years on Tuesday for possessing an illegal firearm, a court spokesman said.  David Walker, 28, was arguing with a friend at a pub in South Yorkshire, northern England, when he went home to get his sawed-off shotgun, which he jammed into his trousers.  But as he walked back to the pub, the gun went off, blasting pellets into his testicles. Doctors later removed what remained of his testicles during emergency surgery.  Walker admitted possessing a prohibited weapon at a hearing in June at the court in Sheffield.   Wow, how horrible... let's hope we don't see "PWN493" like that ever again...

      It’s a common command in any newsroom: “Get it first. But get it right. But get it first.”  By that measure, Tuesday’s edition of the New York Post scored two out of three. Evidently, they forgot the more important direction. GET IT RIGHT, numbskull. You might get "PWNED"!      Paper Gets Unfortunate Exclusive  Tue Jul 6, 1:13 PM ET   NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Post trumpeted Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry's choice of running mate as a front-page exclusive on Tuesday. Trouble is, it named the wrong man.  Before Tuesday's long-awaited announcement, the tabloid reported in an unbylined story that Kerry's pick was Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. But around 9 a.m. (1300 GMT), hours after the late edition hit the streets, Kerry named Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina.  "KERRY'S CHOICE Dem picks Gephardt as VP candidate," blared the banner headline in the Post, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and is openly supportive of Republican President Bush.  The Post's fierce cross-town rival, the tabloid Daily News, could not resist poking fun.  Media sources said the News sent a case of champagne to Post editors and a note, "Congratulations on your front page. Have a nice day," with a smiley face. The barb refers to a Post advertisement near the Daily News building showing improved circulation figures, with the words "have a nice day" and smiley face.  The error recalls the infamous 1948 front-page headline in The Chicago Tribune that blared "Dewey Defeats Truman" -- when in fact Democrat Harry Truman won re-election to the White House against Republican Thomas Dewey in an upset.  Prof. David Rubin, a media expert at Syracuse University in upstate New York, said: "The mistake makes the New York Post look foolish and all it shows is that one should not trust the New York Post, a conservative Republican paper, on inside matters of the Democratic Party."  A spokesman for the Post declined immediate comment.      Decline you should! You have been "OWNED"!

      Why does this always happen to us? The damn Japs always seem to come in and ruin the party. Just look at how the Toyota and Honda corporations do better than our Ford and Chevy in America... we can't compete. Our cars break down every two weeks and you get about $4000 as compared to about $10000 for a Japanese car. Look at Playstation... why us? Well now, we are getting "OWNED" in the EATING DEPARTMENT! We had a 400 pound guy lose to this Japanese midget... how? Read on about this "PWN493"...      Kobayashi Sets Record for Hot Dog Eating  1 hour, 7 minutes ago  By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer  NEW YORK - When it comes to eating hot dogs, "The Tsunami" still blows everybody away. For the fourth straight year, rail-thin Takeru Kobayashi chewed up the competition at the Nathan's Famous hot dog eating competition Sunday, breaking his own previous world record.  Kobayashi, 26, of Nagano, Japan, gulped down 53 1/2 wieners in 12 minutes and shattered his own world record by three dogs. In 2002, he had wolfed down 50 1/2.  The closest competitor Sunday was newcomer Nobuyuki Shirota, 25, of Tokyo, who made an impressive showing but couldn't cut the mustard with 38 downed dogs.  Once again, then, the contest's coveted Mustard Yellow Belt returns to Japan. Since 1996, the Japanese have       ted the competition and only one American — New Jersey's Steve Keiner in 1999 — has captured the belt at the signature July 4 extravaganza.  The 5-foot-7, 132-pound Kobayashi, of Nagano, Japan, employed his trademark method of snapping the dogs in half before swallowing them to destroy the 19 other contestants.  Meanwhile, 105-pound Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas, 36, of Alexandria, Va., could relish two new records: She ate more hot dogs — 32 — than any other woman and any other American in the contest's history.  Eric "Badlands" Booker, a 6-foot-4, 400-pound subway conductor from Long Island who came in fifth with 27 dogs, said he and the other competitive eaters were determined to unseat the Japanese.  "We aren't going to stop until we bring the belt back," he told ESPN.   Kobayashi seemed unworried.  "I will come back next year and try and break the record once again," he said.      Wow... how are we going to stop getting "PWN3D" by these guys? They're too good... that's more than 10,000 calories! I'd die... but why are we fighting with low people like Iraqis? The Japs are the real threat... just kidding... but I'm tired of the "PWN493"! Let's get workin' America!

      This is men getting "PWN3D" to the highest degree... why would anyone in their right mind do this? If you can't handle getting beat at sports, just take it... don't get wild. Look at these crazy Estonians...      Estonians Wife-Carrying Champions for Seventh Year  Sun Jul 4,10:13 AM ET  Add Oddly Enough - Reuters to My Yahoo!   By Daniel Frykholm   SONKAJARVI, Finland (Reuters) - Two Estonian students clinched the country's seventh straight wife-carrying world championship on Saturday, winning the "wife's" weight in beer and a sauna.  Using the "Estonian Carry," where the woman clamps her thighs to the sides of the man's face while hanging upside down on his back, Madis Uusorg carried Inga Klauso 830 feet through a pool and over hurdles in just over a minute.   Uusorg, 20, claimed there was no secret to their victory. "I just tried to run and not think about anything," he said.   "Madis is very good at carrying women. I didn't have to do anything," his friend Klauso, 19, said. Contestants to not have to be married.  The race has its roots in local legend, according to which it was common in the late 19th century to steal women from the neighboring villages.   It is also based on the story of Ronkainen the Robber, who made aspiring gang members prove their worth by carrying sacks of rye along a challenging track.   The competition in the remote central Finnish village of Sonkajarvi, which lies deep in forest and a few hours' drive from the Arctic Circle, drew 18 couples from as far away as Canada, England and Ireland, and around 7,000 spectators.   "The only training we've done is run around the hotel room this morning, but at least we'll be the best in Britain," said Ian Walker, a doctor of psychology from Bath.   "(England) lost the football, lost the tennis, so this is all we have now!"      NO!!! This isn't all you have, idiot... there's a world of paradise around you (and this isn't it). Just please, have mercy on yourselves. You have all been "PWN3D"!

      Although I'm not really affiliated with one party, I am against       istic dictators like Saddam Hussein... I'm not a "Bush" but Saddam got "PWN3D"!     But, we as Americans have been seriously "OWNED" by our administration... either we get new people, or people fix their act... I hope we turn out all right...

      Yes, it happens to the best of us. Microsoft can do it...  So I was on my PC at about 10:30... my friend, Sean tells me to see this video. So I start downloading this video, and five minutes into the download, I get this message...   Internet Explorer cannot download thebottomline1.wmv from ...llyoucaneatentertainment.com.  A system call that should never fail has failed.   Wow... I guess no one can get Windows to work right... and what's worse? Check this experience out...     Linux anyone?

      I apologize if I'm offending any Baptists with this post. I personally don't enjoy harsh treatment for my denomination because the SBC feels that they are the only group deserving of God's care... Therefore, they will be "PWN3D" for telling me I'm going to h3ll for being a Catholic.  You don't believe it? Here you go...   A man went to heaven and was being shown around by St. Peter. As they went from cloud to cloud they came to various doors which St. Peter would open.   One showed a large group rolling on the floor and talking in tongues.  "Our Pentecostals," he said.   Next was a serious ritual. "Our Jewish persuasion," he explained.   Then another ritualistic service. "Here's the Catholic mass."   At the next cloud, he didn't open the door but instead put his forefinger to his lips in the hush motion and they both tiptoed past. Once past, the man asked what that was all about.    "Those are the Baptists," St. Peter explained. "They think they are the only ones here."   I'm quite serious... you're not the only people. Recognize that other people can do what they want! Listen to this account...   I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off.  So I ran over and said "Stop! Don't do it!"  "Why shouldn't I?" he asked. I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!" He said, "Like what?" I said, "Well... are you religious?" He replied, "Yes, very." I said, "Me too! What religion are you?" He said, "Christian." I said, "Me too! Are you a Catholic or a Protestant?" He said, "I'm a Protestant." I said, "Me too! Are you an Episcopalian or a Baptist?" He replied, "Baptist!" I said, "Wow! Me too! Are you in the Baptist Church of God or the Baptist Church of the Lord?" He said, "I'm in the Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you in the Original Baptist Church of God, or are you in the Reformed Baptist Church of God?" He said, "I'm in the Reformed Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915?" He said, "Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915!" I finally said, "Die, heretic scum," and pushed him off.   I really think it's getting bad... first Disney World, now schools?  Recently, I found a list someone had compiled on the web. This really helped clear a few things for me...   You might be a Southern Baptist if...   - You think John the Baptist started the SBC. - You think God's presence is strongest on the back three pews. - You think "Amazing Grace" is the national anthem. - Your definition of fellowship has something to do with food. - You ever wondered when Lottie Moon and Annie Armstrong would get paid off. - You honestly believe that the Apostle Paul spoke King James English. - You think worship music has to be loud. - You think Jesus actually used Welch's grape juice and saltine      ers. - You judge the quality of a service by its length. - You believe that you are supposed to take a covered dish to heaven. - You have never sung the third verse of any hymn. - You clapped in church and felt guilty about it all week. - You are upset that the last hymn in the new hymnal is numbered 666. - You happen to know that Lottie Moon is not a member of the Unification Church.   Luckily, I kept them for one line... you've all got your deserved "PWN493". Hopefully, by posting this, some may become more open to the rest of the world's beliefs. If not, consider yourself on my "To PWN" list...

      I can't believe members of our great president's cabinet would do anything like this... keep reading.      It's Fun for Powell at the 'YMCA'   Fri Jul 2, 5:19 PM ET    By SLOBODAN LEKIC, Associated Press Writer   JAKARTA, Indonesia - U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites) donned a hard hat and tucked a hammer in his belt Friday, performing a version of the Village People's hit "YMCA" at the conclusion of Asia's largest security meeting.  Tradition dictates that the meeting wrap up with a night of song and dance, provided by the diplomats themselves.  In 1997 Madeleine Albright, then secretary of state, bowled over the ministers when she performed a musical skit dressed as Evita Peron.   On Friday, Powell danced alongside five other U.S. officials sporting costumes that included an Indian headdress.   The group blasted out a version of the 1970s disco classic, to the delight of foreign ministers from across the Asia-Pacific and Europe.   "President Bush, he said to me: 'Colin, I need you to run the Department of State. We are between a rock and a hard place," Powell and his colleagues sang to the tune of the disco classic.   The after-dinner show is an annual highlight of the ASEAN Regional Forum, a time for ministers to loosen up after discussing security issues.   The event is closed to the press, but reporters regularly go out of their way to get the scoop.   The Russian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, sang a version of the Beatles "Yellow Submarine" as a woman waving a Russian flag ran around the dinner tables.   Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh read a poem before his delegation burst into a song.   "I'm not worried — but the audience should be," Singh said before attending the gala dinner.      Yes, the audience should be worried. There's a reason the press can't be there. People are getting more sympathetic. They don't want you to get "PWN3D". Wow... I think everyone at this meeting should consider themselves "OWNED" by Colin Powell and this dance... He makes Cheech look like Michael Jackson. This itself is grounds for a change in our administration. Let's just hope our great country isn't "PWNED" like this again...

      Wow... that's all I can say about this... This is off of Hamilton's blog. This kid was seriously "PWN3D"! Wow... How bad would this be? I guess that not everyone gets the gift of a decent name... See below...     PURE "PWN493"   Oh... some more "PWN493" for all of you...     A very "PWN3D" matador, I must say...  I'll try and post soon... probably in a few minutes... this "PWN493" cheers me up...

      I guess I was inspired by people at the "Summer Science Camp" at Clemson University to start my own "Blog". I'm going to dedicate this "Blog" to "PURE OWNAGE". Getting "OWNED" is quite self explanatory. "OWNAGE" is when sh!t happens, and you just have to take it and move on... Some things here are just funny, and some are just horrible.  For example...     Here, as you can see, Justin Timberlake has just been "OWNED".  As you enjoy my page, please... try to minimize your own "OWNAGE" in your daily life... I'll make posts both in pictures and in detailed accounts. Tell me about your own accounts of "OWNAGE" and you might get it posted. Have fun...  (I might add pictures that I didn't come up with, but you can still give me credit... I'm showing them to you)
