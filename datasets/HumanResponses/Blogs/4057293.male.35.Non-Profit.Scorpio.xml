      I'm new to blogging but doing it partially because it is an interesting medium for expression, you're supposed to reflect on your life in a journal anyway, right?,  it's damn cool (in Philadelphia, I get be the "early adopter" (usually I am in the next wave-- the gotta have it compulsives) and explain blogs and RSS feeds to a table of bright young things in the new wine bar in town (link to come).  But there can also be self-disclosure in the name of a cause.  I found  urlLink this  on Anil Dash's blog. He described an idea that expanded my understanding of blogs:  Isolation is a critical element in many people's experience with mental illness, especially depression, which is why prescriptions for treatment often include pet ownership or volunteering in a community. But if the goal is to find a community in which one identifies, where peers and people of a similar bent can be discovered, then few tools are as effective as a format that ignores geography in favor of proximity of personality.  So, if you get a chance, and it's appropriate for the type of site that you run, you might want to talk about the experiences you've had, or that those who you care about have had. Having someone to identify with can change someone's life permanently and for the better. It did for me.    I've only read Anil's 2002 entry and the most recent ones, so I have some catching up to do, starting with his  urlLink introduction . Do people read old blog entries to catch up or are they running as fast as they can to digest the latest entries on their plates?   I worry-- is a blog tedious when the writer censors himself or herself?  When does a blogger become an flame-worthey exhibitionist, a narcissist?

      Boyfriend and I usually stay home on Friday night, but not this week! Missed two SEPTA trains, took a $40 cab from the suburb where I work, trying to meet Boyfriend in West Philly for dinner and a movie. I was an hour late.  The Bridge theater was a madhouse. Good film though, Manchurian Candidate.  urlLink Meryl   urlLink Streep  dominated her every scene. I am rehersing her two big speeches and studying her mannerisms for just the right occasion. Click the links above to hear her play the ambitious and obsessive mother who would do anything for her son.  Lost my new three week old $180 no-discount mobile phone (at the Bridge? by my building's mailboxes?) after losing my last phone after six months...the replacement cycles are getting shorter... and had a big breakdown. My cat hasn't been so scared since we moved him to this apartment. Boyfriend listening to me scream on the land line. I smashed one headset when he yelled at me to calm down (why didn't I think of that?), the batteries ran out on the second headset while he was trying to calm me down, and of course I couldn't call him back on the mobile, since it started this whole train wreck by going missing.  The whole movie thing was to salvage Friday nights from sitting around alone while Boyfriend was stepping, and then sitting around with him after he was finished since it was hard to schedule anything after his Friday encounter group breaks up at 8-- the only convenient time for some of the participants. I find it a huge pain in the ass (Boyfriend gets a lot out of participating, but what about MY needs!)-- I would like to have some treat to look forward to on Friday night after five days of work-home-work-home.  Law & Order: SVU has lost its magic.  Olivia always asking "Did you check for semen?"  Yes, I did.  Anyway our attempt to inject some magic into Friday night ended horribly. Staying home in front of the TV event for Law & Order would have been so much more soothing and cheap.  Alas.

      Every week, I collect a bunch of articles and recipies from the  urlLink NYT food section  Some I print out, some I clip from the web, some I cut and paste into Word files. The problem is the same as with the rest of my life-- organization. Keeping them in a Word or web clipping subdirectory on my computer (work of home, not that I surf during business hours, ahem) means out of sight, out of mind. Printouts just mean chaos. I already lost last week's great artice on okra. I'm from Virginia (but both parents are Northeners) but I love regional cooking, and good okra recipes are hard to come by. To get someone to eat okra, you have to beg them try, or prepare it carfully to avoid the slime for which it is infamous  Any organizing ideas?

       urlLink More  from Keith on successful blogging:   A Successful Blog Makes…  Friends.  I tend to look at my readers as friends and I think many others do as well. I’ve also made quite a few offline pals via my blog. Who doesn’t need more friends?  Industry contacts.  Similar to friends, these are people who can help you further your career.  Knowledge.  I can’t tell you how much my blog has helped me learn. I can ask questions and discuss things I otherwise wound have never had the opportunity to talk about with people I’d have never been able to talk to.  Money.  I don’t personally make much, but there is evidence out there of people making a decent living from their blog. Good content should be worth something.  History.  I use my blog to chronicle things I’ve done, lessons learned and experiences shared. It’s a mini-history of a sort.  Opportunity.  My blog has put in me in some opportune places I’d have never seen without it. By getting your name and content out there you open yourself to all kinds of opportunity.  Stress.  It’s not all good, although I like to begin with the positive. A successful blog can be very stressful and time consuming.  Jobs.  Similar to opportunity as successful blog can open the door to work opportunities. It can be a great extension of a resume or online portfolio. A blog can be a great way to land new clients.  Community.  One of the reasons why I work so hard at my site is because I have a passion for the Web and I love to talk with others who share that passion. It connects me to a community I care about.  Personal pride.  It just feels good to create something lasting and put effort into something you believe in.  Professional development.  If you run a professional or industry blog you can’t help but learn things and hone skills that will help you professionally.  Anything you want.  A blog can about, and for, anything at all. People try to nail it down at times, but in my mind it can be whatever you wish it to be and therefore you can choose what you get out of it.    I quoted Keith here rather than just linking to his site because I want to read his pointers every time I view my blog. Early in the life of "This Is Really Important" I want to record how I learned to be a good blogger.  He also has a great  urlLink entry  on creating an "about the blogger" page.

      Jeremy Chrysler of  urlLink blogcritics.com , highlights a National Review  urlLink article  by Victor Hanson that raises a question that I have been concerned about for the last couple of years-- the level of political rhetoric and debate (forget about political discussion--that's long gone)has become so personal and vicious-- it's all "the (liberals/conservatives) are lying stupid liars" and Crossfire thrust and parry. David Brooks has written about this in the New York Times, and there is a hilarious  urlLink piece  by P.J. O’Rourke, a conservative, about conservative talk radio in the July/August issue of the Atlantic. Ironically, Hanson writes for the National Review, a magazine that has mixed smart, high-minded writing with this mean personal stuff for years. Why does the liberal elite (of which I suppose I am one, and certainly I am surrounded by them) express such hate for Bush himself, rather than critique his polical ideology, policies, and record, with the possible exception of the occupation of Iraq, although many attribute that to his stupidity, not a new and risky doctrine of preemptive war.  Victor Hanson has a point (!):   [T]he Left hates George W. Bush for who he is rather than what he does. Southern conservatism, evangelical Christianity, a black-and-white worldview, and a wealthy man's disdain for elite culture — none by itself earns hatred, of course, but each is a force multiplier of the other and so helps explain the evolution of disagreement into pathological venom.       As if to prove Hansen's point, dozens of people posted angry comments in response to Jeremy's essay. But I would add to Hansen's litany enormous anger and bitterness about the Right's peronal attacks on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Indeed, it may be true that "they started it," but we have good tactical reasons, as well as a civic duty, to elevate our discourse, whether on not conservatives continue to act like cruel teenagers.  I am no Bush fan, but besides the fact that some of this is based on anti-Chrisitan antipathy and anti-Blue state sentiment, I believe that the animus is counterproductive. Bush’s record and stands on issues important to many people-- health care, retirement, the economy, the war in Iraq--are out of step with the majority of Americans, especially the small but powerful independent/undecideds. Plus there are plenty or rural, evangelican Christians, Southerners and anti-intellectuals that are potential Kerry people. Why alienate them and push them into the Bush camp? Can Kerry win the election only carrying Red states? And don't forget that there are Blue staters mixed in with the Reds.

      Many thanks to Keith Robinson for his sharing  urlLink thoughts  on the Good Blog:   A successful blog (or blogger) is…  Well written.  Good content will make or break your blog. Period. This it the #1 thing that makes a blog successful in my book.  Frequently updated.  Unless you’re a guru of some sort you really need to stay on top of it. This can be a real challenge.  Consistent.  This is kind of a combination of the first two. I like sites that are able to maintain quality and frequency overtime.  Open.  I like to read people who are honest and willing to talk about tough issues in a free and open way.  Responsive.  Those who respond to feedback and try to adapt to the wants and needs of their audience get high marks from me.  Well designed.  Yes, I do judge a blog by its design. It’s not the most important thing, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t matter at all.  Aware of its audience.  If you don’t know your audience it’ll show.  Varied in topic.  I feel there are lots of people who would disagree with this, but I like sites that change the subject every once in awhile.  Personal.  I tend to enjoy a blog with a bit of a personality. I want to “get to know”, to a certain degree, the person(s) behind the site. Tone and style have a lot to do with this.  Thick skinned.  With any successful site comes nay-sayers, trolls, pedants and spammers.  Honest.  Readers are smart and they can smell bullshit.  Accountable.  Mistakes are inevitable and there are times when it’s best to fess up and admit where you’re wrong.  Funny.  I like a blog that can make me laugh on occasion.   In the old days, I would have clipped this passage from the newspaper, posted it to my bulletin board and mailed it to a few people with the attribution scrawled across the top. Things change.

      and I stood on my chair and cheered. She was one of a dozen scientists, poets, etc., getting honoraries, and the tallest one there. I got a law degree.  urlLink Read this  for a moving eulogy.  And the Times created a  urlLink special section  in her honor.   Out of respect, I placed a copy of  urlLink Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume One  on my cookbook stand.  Next weekend, I'll cook from it.
