       Okay, I've waited a bit to write this, hoping something interesting would happen...but, alas...nothing. So, let's see. The most interesting thing I did last night was let Jason draw a temporary tattoo on my arm. I didn't watch (hello, men's gymnastics was on!) so when he got done, what a surprise! I had a....um...winged vagina with a halo over it on my arm. YIKES! Interesting, but yikes!!! I did find out that I will finally get the last of the money that Northwest owes me on friday...just in time to spend it all at Melissa's bachelorette party *LOL*  Anyhoo....Tomorrow is my last full day here at work. EEEEKKKKSSS!!! I'm nervous. Very. Very. Nervous.  Sooo... here is the website of the day...I've been told it's very funny, but you have to have sound, which I don't, and Quicktime, which I don't. Sooo...if it's bad...don't blame me!!!    urlLink  http://www.somethingdirectory.com/main_emo.htm

       Mornin!      Hope you all are wonderful today! I'm in a good mood (again, two days in a row! wow!) because I'm wearing my new pink shoes! *LOL* Yes...you heard right...I (of all people) own a pair of pink shoes...not just one pair...but TWO!!!! Thank you, Target!       Anyhoo, had to get that out of the way. OMG. I went up to Mark's store to pick up the tape of Sherwood's music, didn't realize it was the INDOOR show. Thanks for telling me that ahead of time, Mark! GRR. And of all the freakin songs Greta had to pick....Fred Durst's remake of Behind Blue Eyes. Gawd, haven't I heard that song enough times on 98.9? Now I have to not only listen to it a bizillion more times....I HAVE TO WRITE A SHOW TO IT!!! *screams* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! So, yeah. Fun Fun. Thanks Greta!      Also talked to Cardiff, stopping by tonight to help her a bit with West's color scheme and flags. I hope she get's the silk in soon, I told her I'd make them (for a ~small~ fee, of course *winks*) but my time is rapidly disappearing. EEKS!!! School starts in 6 days!!! I'm getting so nervous...but at least I have all of my books.       So, yeah...that's about it for today, except for....       THE WEBSITE OF THE DAY!!!     urlLink http://www.empoweredproducts.com/product_one.php?id=5    This lovely product will make a great addition to yesterdays *winksNgiggles* Enjoy, all!

        GOOD MORNING TO YOU, GOOD MORNING TO YOU, GOOD MORNING TO YOOOOOUUUU....GOOD MORNING TO YOU!         I hope you all are having a wonderful day! Mine is wonderful so far...didn't fall asleep on the drive in, am wearing a new shirt (always guaranteed to make a glorious day ;-)) and I'm actually getting used to getting up at 6am. Wow, I can't believe I just said that. Yuck. Anyway! Last night was good, got a lot done. I finally got some info regarding Sherwood (Sherman, Sherwood, whatever!) and where I'll be sleeping....AT THE SPONSER'S HOUSE!!! Please, pray, meditate, send me good thoughts, SOMETHING!!! I'll  so  need it!!! :-( And here I was, looking forward to getting a hotel room with Jason and having a little mini-vacation. GRR.       I also talked to Sheri, the Sky instructor in charge of the fundraisers, and she's going to see if we can get Express involved too. More people, more money! I really hope Ann okay's this, because they really need the money!      Anyway, another reason I'm super duper happy, is I bought clothes last night, and 3 pairs of shoes *giggles* I'm bad....but one was only $5.00!!! and the other two were $7.00. I couldn't pass it up, they're way too cute, and the munchkin likes them too. Jason's not too thrilled, though... *big grin* oh well.       So, anyhoo, other than that, didn't do too much last night, cleaned the kitchen and front room, did laundry, went to the grocery store, crocheted a bit. Pretty boring night, overall. The best kind! ;-)      Ooo, Ooo, almost forgot...yet another reason, I found the car I want. Hopefully I'll find one once the Ford is payed off and can fix it all up and stuff. The picture is up above...ain't she purdy?    urlLink     And, last but definatily not least....the website of the day is...   urlLink http://www.manties.net/       Enjoy!

        Okay, first of all, I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. Mine was...interesting. Didn't feel like a weekend at all.           Saturday Jason drug me out of bed @ 9am (how rude!!!) to go to a swap meet up at the Woodlands. It was actually a lot of fun, saw a lot of antique cars, and some newer ones too...and about a bizillion car parts! *LOL* And, of course, got a sunburn (my last one isn't even healed yet!) but it's not too bad....now I have very weird tan lines. After that we went up north and checked out Zona Rosa. Wow! That place is kick ass!!! Little too expensive for my wallet, though :-( We ended up at Outback for dinner, I haven't been there in forever, so it was a nice change...there aren't any in Lawrence :-( We saw The Village after that....KICK ASS!!!! I highly recommend that movie!!! It's not necessarily scary....but just go see it!          Anyway...Sunday started way too early...6AM!!!! YUCK!!!! I had to drive up to Worlds of Fun, where we then proceeded to sit on our butts (in the sun, of course) for about an hour. (fun? What fun?) We all (all 5 of us...where did the rest go? There weren't anymore!!! GRR!!!!) got stuck in Foods, up at Vittle Griddle (near Front Street, looks towards Cyclone Sam's), but as the day went by, they got shuffled to different places, I ended up being the only one there. But...against all odds...I actually had FUN! I bonded with the 14-16 year olds there, they were all amused by my piercings. And, I got to play with money all day. Slow cooks (more "fun raisers" who had no clue what they were doing) made the end of the day harder, and the fact that I ate breakfast @ 6:30 and didn't get a break until 3:45 was kinda annoying too...but I still had fun. plus, it was inside...so no more  SUNBURN  .            So, I ended up in bed by about 8:30...I know, I know...I'm an old lady, but gosh, it felt sooooooooo good to lay down and rest. And today, I get to explore the wonderful world of laundry and housecleaning, since I did none of the above over the weekend. Bad me.           Ooo, Ooo...the website of the day is...  urlLink http://www.engrish.com  Hehehehe, please don't be too offended...it's supposed to be FUNNY!          KO, until something interesting happens....Bu-Bye!

        Wow, getting up at 6am sucks ASS!!! I don't suggest it.  But, here I am again, bright, early, and without a drop of ice cream.  Be proud of me!  I couldn't resist the chocolate milk, though...MMMMMMMMMMM yummy.            Yet again, i have nothing interesting to report this morning.  The most amusing thing I did last night was listen to music, looking for a song for Express's show this year.  Found a few...now have to run them by the PTB and see what they say.  I know, I know...it's early to be thinking about guard, but I'm trying to get shit settled before school starts.  I won't need the extra stress (and thinking) then.          So, yeah.  Was a quiet night, very nice. :-)  I highly suggest it.  (Didn't I warn you this would be boring?  Well, give me a few weeks, it'll brighten up, I promise!)          KO, I'm off to enjoy my chocolate milk...if anything interesting and wonderful happens...I'll warn you.          OOOOOOOOO!  The website of the day is...    urlLink   http://www.blackjackinc.com       Go check it out!!! Yay Happy Bunny!

         *Screams* Why do I do this? I just gave up my last free weekend before school starts....for what, you might ask? To work as a "FUN RAISER" at Worlds of Fun. FUN!?!? I put in my time there...and it was far from fun! *sobs* I don't wanna!!! Anyone want to go in my place?           And...in one awful second, my last free time drains away from me.  :-(  *growls* I now feel much better about being a lazy bum on the weeknights.          Now...for those of you who are smart enough to realize there are still two weekends before school...coconut covered cookies for you! Yes, I am well aware of this second weekend! But, as with this weekend, I bartered it away last week, agreeing to teach a guard camp friday night and saturday morning before rushing the 2+ hours home and trying to tame my poor afro into something presentable in public for the bachelorette party. (Hint hint, anyone wishing to help me in the taming of the 'fro is welcome at my house!!!)           Okay...venting done (for the moment) I will now be rejoining my currently scheduled programming (filing...yay)

        So, it's been pointed out that I didn't talk enough about school. :-) So, the plan is to double major in Astronomy and Physics at KU. Wish me luck!!          Anyway, I'm quite enjoying my last 2 weeks of freedom, so there's really not much to say...last night, let's see...I...ate dinner, read for a while, and crocheted for a while! WHOO HOO!!! I'm spent, BEDTIME! *LOL* I did at least RSVP for the bachlorette party, LAST BIG PARTY!!! I can't WAIT!!! I guess we're going to the Outhouse, then up to D&amp;D. Boobies and liquor! Don't you wish you could go? :-)          And now, bright and early (7:00am....YUCK!!!) I'm here at work, enjoying some early morning chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. *LOL* Don't you want to be me?

       Okay, so, I'm starting this out of boredom, and rest assured, within a few days (or weeks) you'll stop reading it for the same reason. :-)   So....since I'm never good when put on the spot, and have a tendency to ramble, please, bear with me. I'm assuming that since you got this address, you already know me, and to those I apologize, because I'm going to backtrack a bit for the others who have been out of touch a bit.  Let's see. I am now officially 23, I live with my boyfriend Jason in Lawrence, I work at a Bolt and Nut distributor, I drive a ford, (EWWWWWWW!!!! I can't believe I just said that...shoot me someone!), I start school in 2 weeks, I choreograph winterguard for Northwest Missouri State University (though, we've got more than a few CMSU kids joining, so I suppose I have to call it "Express" now, like everyone else....blah) and just got roped into choreographing fall and winterguard for Sherman High School....wherever that is. Let's see...I currently have about a billion guppies (anyone want some?) and have been promised a kitten (hint hint, Jason). I am also the most dreadful, horrendous, awful maid of honor for my best friend's wedding (please forgive me Lis!), but I'm working on that :-)  I have 11 piercings, and 7 tattoos.   Okay, so I can't think of anymore background at the moment, so I guess I'll stop rambling. If anyone can think of anything earthshattering to add, please remind me..ya'll know I have the memory (and attention span) of a goldfish.
