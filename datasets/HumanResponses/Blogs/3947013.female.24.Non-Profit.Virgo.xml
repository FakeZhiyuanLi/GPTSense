      After a year and eight months, I am headed back to California.  I have loved living in NY, it has been such an awesome experience.  Sometimes a bit dramaful, and really hard, but over all I made friends that I truly adore, and it will be hard to live without them.  I had a job that I really learned a lot in, and offered me great experiences... but in the end my family and my friends are in Cali, and that is where my home is meant to be.  I will miss NY, the action, the atmosphere, and metropolitan life.  But, it will be fantactic to be back in California, and I look forward to all that I have in store.

      After a couple of weeks of living in the great city, searching for a job, we decided that we needed to try to enjoy some of the free entertainment while we could.&nbsp; We tried to book tickets to many of the shows taped in NY, but they are quite hard to come by.&nbsp; Eventually we got tickets to see “The View”

      Chisselle and I ventured out in the cold to see some sights.&nbsp; We tried to brave through the freezing temperatures, and went to see the Statue of Liberty, and some other sights.&nbsp; The cold made our sight seeing very limited.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; After a 5-hour flight, with all the belongings I could manage to carry in tow, I jumped in a shuttle and was on my way to my new home. I arrived at my apartment on 112 West 72nd Street.&nbsp; Chisselle was there to greet me, and I unloaded in to my tiny studio apartment.  &nbsp; For the 1st month I was in NY the temperature was never above 30 degrees.&nbsp; Brrrr!&nbsp; About two weeks after I moved in, Chisselle and I were getting into the elevator with our neighbor from next door, who we had not yet met.&nbsp; We told her that we just moved in, and she and I realized that we looked very familiar.&nbsp; I asked her where she was from, and she said Leucadia.&nbsp; Margaret, who attended my high school, and grew up about a mile away from me, was now my next-door neighbor in New York City!&nbsp; She said that in the 5 years that she had lived in NY she had never just bumped into anyone from San Diego.&nbsp; Margaret was a lifesaver in so many ways.&nbsp; She helped us out with getting to know the neighborhood, some new friends, and in finding a job.

       urlLink    A crocodile entering the swamp that our boat is in!&nbsp;  &nbsp; So we take a lovely little swamp tour, in which we see all sorts of wildlife, bats, monkeys, birds and more, and we even took a dip in the beautiful clear water.&nbsp; Then we got back in the boat, went down a bit further, and took a right.&nbsp; That is where this little guy was also getting in for a dip in the water.&nbsp; I am not a fan of anything with sharp teeth, and our boat (which was really not all that stable or large) seemed like it would be a nice target for the croc, but he left us alone... and we were soon out of the swampy area, back in the clear (water that is)

      To mix it up a little, we were graced by a blizzard instead of the usual freezing weather that we were slowly becoming accustomed to.&nbsp; This blizzard was a record breaker, and was the worst in 27 years.&nbsp; The streets were so covered in snow, that it brought traffic to a halt.&nbsp; People were cross-country skiing down the middle of the city streets.&nbsp; Central park was crowded with adults and kids sledding on pizza boxes, and snowboarding down small hills.

      After nearly three months in New York, and no luck in the treacherous job-hunt, Chisselle was forced to move back to California.&nbsp; It was hard to adjust to NY without Chisselle, but it was her best option.&nbsp;

      A welcome change of titles from:&nbsp; “unemployed” to “Program Coordinator”. I began working at The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity.&nbsp; My new job would bring many new challenges, friends, and insights to both the non-profit and business world.&nbsp; I was ecstatic about my new opportunity to work for a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and a humanitarian foundation.&nbsp; My new office put me in the heart of mid-Manhattan.

      The great search for a new apartment ends, and I move to Tribeca.&nbsp; I end up finding a three-bedroom apartment in Tribeca, in which the lady is renting out two of the rooms.&nbsp; After moving in, I realize that there are many house rules that were not discussed before hand.&nbsp; The lady basically does not want us to exist outside of our rooms in the apartment, and we have rules that state that our clothes must be put away neatly.&nbsp; My roommate and I come to find out that the building is subsidized housing, and between the two of us, we are probably paying more than the rent even is.&nbsp; Back on the hunt for an apartment again!

      On a beautiful warm and humid summer day, we went to the first movie in the park for the summer movie series.&nbsp; We arrived to Bryant Park more than three hours before the movie was going to start, and the place was packed.&nbsp; The lawn was going to open at 7 PM, and we were ready with our blankets in hand to grab a spot on the lawn, but so were about 300 other people.&nbsp; So when the lawn officially opened, we ran with our blanket on to the lawn, grabbed a pretty decent spot, and tried to claim our territory as quick as possible.&nbsp; Then it was relaxing sitting in the warm night, drinking wine, and watching “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” on the big screen under the stars.

      Fly home to California for my first visit since I had moved to New York.&nbsp; Although I had not been away for all that long, I was over excited to go home and see everyone.&nbsp; When I arrived home, there was another surprise visitor at the house, DAD!!!&nbsp; On the 13th we went to Casey’s promotion, and Ryan’s High School graduation.&nbsp; On the 14th I threw Michelle, one of my best frineds from High School,&nbsp;her Bridal Shower, and on the 15th, Father’s day, I spent quality time with my family, tiling the upstairs!&nbsp; Then it was back to NY!

      June 28th, no make that June 30th, or July 2nd!  Finally after days of stress and confusion I move into my new apartment.&nbsp; The apartment is very nice, so is my new roommate, but unfortunately, the guy in charge is anything but nice!&nbsp; We were to move into the place on the 28th, the weekend before the 1st of the month.&nbsp; But then when I call to confirm, with my Uhaul van all booked and ready to pick up the next morning, I am told I can’t move in.&nbsp; Ok, so I move my stuff over with the van and stay in Tribeca until the 1st and then I move in, well the night before the 1st, I call to confirm, and no, the place is still not ready.&nbsp; So I stay with Natasa on the 1st, and finally on the 2nd I am able to move in.&nbsp; Despite hours of work my roommate put in cleaning the place it is still a mess from all the construction.&nbsp; A week goes by, and then I get the pleasure of meeting George.&nbsp; I hear a knock at my door, and it is someone needing to wash his hands.&nbsp; He tells me his name is George, he is the landlord of the building, and I ask him what he is talking about; I thought Jay was in charge.&nbsp; Well it turns out that Jihad Ageeb is charging us an extra $600 a month for the apartment.&nbsp; George tells me what the rent really is, and I tell him what Jay had told me, about it being more, and that Jay was in charge.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Poor Jay is stopped in his tracks in what was proving to be a great scam, with him pocketing $600 a month.&nbsp; &nbsp; Uh, guess it is time to start apartment hunting, AGAIN!

      Fireworks in New York!&nbsp; It was quite a day.&nbsp; After having some traditional BBQ dinner at Natalie and Loraine’s, we all headed over to meet up with Rolla, to enjoy the Fireworks display over the East River.&nbsp; The show was amazing, the fireworks were beautiful, and the crowd was huge.&nbsp; Thousands of people were assembled on the FDR highway and standing for hours waiting for the sun to go down, and the show to start.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it did, it proved that it was worth the wait!

      Ummm, what happened to the lights?&nbsp; At 4:10 PM New York City along with the rest of the Northeastern US, &amp; parts of Canada were blacked out by a power failure. My first thought was that the power had gone out in our office, or maybe our building.&nbsp; But then a minute later after a couple of phone calls, we learned that all of New York State was out, &amp; even the whole northeastern region.  &nbsp; So Natalie &amp; I closed up the office, &amp; began to walk uptown. You would never know how many people work in the buildings in the city, until they are all forced to come out on to the streets. We had successfully arranged a meeting spot with Loraine, but not with Natasa.&nbsp; We waited on the Manhattan side of the 59th Street Bridge for about 40 minutes, trying to contact her on her cell, but with no luck.&nbsp; Finally we trekked across the bridge, a little nervously, as we were with hundreds of other people, &amp; we were unsure as to how the power outage had occurred, &amp; what exactly was going on.&nbsp; The silent thought on everyone’s mind was the possibility of terrorism.&nbsp; Finally we reached the Queen’s side of the bridge, &amp; walked anther 45 minutes or so until we made it to Natalie’s apartment.&nbsp; We just barely made it before sundown.&nbsp; With some 800 people stuck in elevators across the city, &amp; thousands stranded on subways, we were worried about our unaccounted for friends.&nbsp; But the next morning we learned that everyone was safe.&nbsp; The night of the blackout we decided to take advantage of the darkness, &amp; take out a telescope &amp; check out the stars.

      Natalie, Rachel, Donna and I go to have dinner up on the Upper East Side, and then to see Mr. Wiesel speak at the 92nd Street Y.&nbsp; The lecture lasts about an hour and a half, and is very interesting about politics, life and history.

      Fly home to California to celebrate Christmas, and the New Year.&nbsp; It has almost been a year in the Big Apple, and the visit is, as always, very welcome.&nbsp; I get to see everyone at home for the holidays, and enjoy some time away from work, and relaxing with friends and family!&nbsp; A hectic trip as ALWAYS.. but fun nonetheless.

      First snowfall of the season proves to be a record breaker.&nbsp; The snow falls, and keeps falling!&nbsp; The second day of the snowstorm is an official blizzard.&nbsp; The total snowfall in Central Park is just over 18 inches.&nbsp;

      Rolla and I go to check out a play at Theater Row, called “Our Fathers.”&nbsp; The play is a two person, one act play, that is well done, but the begining was so slow, and the theater is so small.. that if you fall asleep the actors will see you sleeping!

       urlLink   So after our long trek into Brooklyn, across the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping in at Juniors for some delicious cheese cake, and then walking to the Botanic Garden, we are able to stop and enjoy the flowers.  These tulips were gorgeous, and the picture does not really do justice to the imensity of the color, and number of tulips there.  The Gardens also had a festival for the Sakura (cherry blossom trees) and all of the trees were in bloom.  Along with the beautiful scenery there was some Japanese music, and cuisine.

Michelle and I did not know if it was appropriate to take pictures in front of the site, and I actually had refrained for the time I had been in NY, and when I had visited before.  But with so many others taking photographs, and knowing that the site is quickly being rebuilt, we decided that we should take pictures so that we can have a memory of visiting the site.

       urlLink      Seeing Liz Phair in concert was a huge disappointment.. I think that it is really her older albums that Loraine and I liked, and she is nothing like what she used to be.  The opening act, Rachel Yamagata (a Hapa! :) ) was cool to see in concert, but she was sick, and I guess not up to her usual performance.  Anyways, after stading at the Roseland Ballroom for 3 hours we were starving, and headed to Mickey D's... hahaha
