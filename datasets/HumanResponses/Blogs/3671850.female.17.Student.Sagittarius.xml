       Don't you hate it when you have all this stress and thoughts in your head and feel like there is nothing that you can do?  I went to the movies with my mom tonight to see  The Notebook  it was muy buen... but very sad at the same time... it brought back some memories for me... some good... and some not-so-good, but it was fun.  I've been thinking a lot about what I am going to do after I graduate... and I'm really just sort of down about it all.  I will go to USC or College of Charleston... most likely USC... and eventually come back to Easley.. or Greenville.. or somewhere in SC and start my quiet lil' life in a quiet lil neighborhood... My friends on the other hand.. my best friends who i dont think i could live without.. will be 1) Jess- may still be around here but may move to a somewhat larger somewhat more exciting state.  2) Chad- I will probably never see(what I've thought about the most) He will move to California or .. somewhere in a HUGE city and dance with the stars.  and 3) Nikol- will be floating on a cruize ship..(that her daddy owns) somewhere in the ocean....   I just cant think about all this.. I know we can stay in touch.. I'm just not sure how hard it will be for me to transistion from H.S to college... and I really dont want to invest all my feelings in a relationship that will eventually break my heart... but no one else seems to be worried about this.. I guess its just me... Drained...

       Today was lots of fun :)  I woke up with one of my best friends in the world (and future college roomate) Well not  with  her but u know.. and then we ate a very delicious breakfast, danced to some radio music, discussed community restrooms and drank  lots  of coffee!!!  Thats enough to make me smile :)  Anyway, then i went to work my long shift of two hrs (slaved over the subs)  Oh, side note... I thought this was cute: A little, old man came in and wanted "Pro-ve-lony) cheese.. hehe.. ok.. had to be there.  I came home and then went out with my favorite people in the world.  And yes, I love u  all  the  same .  I love Jessica because she is my homegirl, my aundre, my sista, my roommate, my partner-in-crime, and my pretend lezi (when it comes in handy).  I love Nikol because she is my stir-fry, my "honest" friend, my love advisor, my cutex, the girl (ya kno, in X men), my (cheerleader-dance-buddy), and my identical twin. And I love Chad because he makes me smile, laugh, always cracks on the dawnut/dawnation/cookie daw/dwar, because he makes me happy, and he's my beefstew (no undertone intended). Ok, Ok thats enough LOVE for one day... Where is the love????? (BEP)  Wise words for the day: "Errrbody in the club love Cindy,  errrbody in the club love Cindddyyyy "

       I official like the Ashlee Simpson cd (thanks to Kol and Jess), but she still can't beat my  Avril Lavigne ...  Today I slaved away at Subway *cough for 2 hrs* ahem, and then I went to my Grandmothers for some lunch and to change.  I then got to see Chad, for a little while anyway.  We met up and went to Best Buy (where he refused to renew his membership), the mall (where we bought absolutely nothing, but we did spend a little while in the  vibrating  chairs at Brookstone, lol) and lastly we went to Starbucks for a Frappacino, ummmm.    After I left Chads, I ran by my Grandmothers, again, this time to see Morgan.  She brightened up my day!  Then I headed home to change clothes so I could hang out with my girls, which was a blast.  We had a lil' app-ple-beeeess, a lil' starbuckarooonies, and a lil' auuugghhhh, loosaaa luuuucys.  lol.  We also had an adventure, in the  ghetto gas station .. whew... worn me out.  Anyway... I had a blast.. but I did miss Sarah! :(  I'm such a  matchmaker!!!   Ryan and Laura are on their way to hookin' up.. yea for me!  I'm sooo happy for them, its great.  I'm excited about tomorrow because they have planned another date!     You make me wanna la la.  In the kitchen on the floor I'll be your french maid. When I'll meet you at the door I'm like an alley cat. Drink the milk up I want more. You make me wannaYou make me wanna scream. You can meet me on an airplane. Or in the back of the bus.  You can throw me like a boom-a-rang. I'll come back and beat you up.     ~Okay thats sooo my line.

       Okay, so I feel soooo much better.  Last night Chad and I had a loooong talk about  everything  and I'm keepin' my fingers crossed. I really hope everything will be okay, but if its not then at least I know that I still have a wonderful friendship.   I also passed on my mustang- georgia man  to Jessica--which satisfies me greatly--no more redneck grammar, whew.  Anyway, I have also given up on the job search.  Does ANYONE realize how bad the economy is right now, hello???  I hope its not this hard to get a job when I'm older--I'll just have to run the  corner .   Today I only had to work from 11:45-1:45.. okay so i made like what, 10 bucks, after taxes.... ohhhhh yea, rollin in the big do' now.  After work I went to my grandmothers to help her with some paperwork and then I came home to get ready to see Chad... first time in like 20 something days!!! I really, really missed him.  I gave him his New York shirt and he bought the  Alice in Wonderland p urse for me--the one that I wanted soooo bad in Florida.  We went to Sticky Fingers with his family and his grandmother told us how onions, and tomatos, and blueberries... etc were good for you.  Then back to his house to watch tv and look at prom pictures that I still had not gotten (and listen to the true confessions of Papa Smurf.. pew pew pew), and last we came back to my house to play with Morgan (while she played dress up with Chad).  I had a really fun time today with Chad, I just  haaaate  that I have to work tomorrow.. grrr.

       I had lots of  fun  today despite the fact that I had to work and Chad did not call me.... Okay, okay so i only had to work for 2 hrs, but I feel the need to complain.&nbsp; When I got off work I met Jessica at Wal-Mart so we could go  "job-hunting"  together.&nbsp; We went to all the lil' shops in Easley then&nbsp; we went to Powdersville where we saw a miracle: "Help Wanted".&nbsp; Well little did we know that we would have to drive  across the state  to get a piece of scrap paper... i mean, an  application .&nbsp; Anyway... it was fun, and I did learn my way around Greenville from the expirence... hmmmm.&nbsp; We also paid a surprise visit to Nikol!!!!&nbsp;   Highlight of the day: I got an early application to USC .. yeaaaa!  Disappointment of the day: The job was for full-time.. grrr   &nbsp;

       I had yet  another  wonderful time with my girls tonight.&nbsp; This morning I went to church where I saw the "happily engaged" couple, and you know that made my day, ahem.... I went to Grand China with my sister, mom and lil' miss Morgan (the  princess .&nbsp; She's at that stage where if she screams then she gets her way unless you prefer complete humiliation).&nbsp; Then I came home, took a nap, and had the strangest dream.&nbsp; I was in this water city or some place like a lake but it was very pretty water and the place had all these steps or gazebo type things in it.&nbsp; Some anonymous girl (and I) were following a guy through this water world type thing... make any sense to you? Interpret please.&nbsp; Anyway then I woke up and went back to church, totally made an idiot out of myself in front of a totally hott guy, then partied with the girls.&nbsp; Jessica and I went to Applebee's while Kol and Sarah went to a Sunday School meeting.&nbsp; Then we all met up for  ice cream  * could I get a sample of that, from..... that guy right there?*&nbsp; and shopped out of the back of Sarahs pimp car.&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; That was it!&nbsp; I'm sooooo disappointed that I have to work tomorrow, but  Chad  comes back tomorrow too... so that makes it better :)&nbsp; Good nite, muaaaah!

       Today was laid back and wonderful.&nbsp; No work-- I just ran errands, got some sun, and went out with the girls (which was the best, as always).&nbsp; I had to get up early to go to the doctor so that he could tell me that something was wrong with my toe... no really????? Do they not think maybe I knew that and  MAYBE  that was why I went to see them.. hmmm.&nbsp; I should be an ace in medical school.&nbsp; After that I helped my grandma with her records and came home to chill.&nbsp; Then I had my adventure with the girls.&nbsp; We all&nbsp;looked like&nbsp;models and this is what we did:  1) Picked up Jessica and met Sarah at RSBC 2) Picked up Nikol and met Laura at the mall 3) Went to Chile's for some grub 4) Went back to the mall and Circut City&nbsp;for some shoppin' 5)  Fell  down the stairs 6) Got some Fraps and made bets (I can make it!) 7) Dropped Laura off at her car and raced a motorcycle 8) Hung out at Wal-Mart and the stinky bathroom in Bi-Lo *Did I forget that we almost died..... twice.   That was my day.&nbsp; I'm always happy to be with my buds and no guys.... :)&nbsp;   &nbsp;

Come on now.&nbsp; Oh side note: I did not mean to affend Jess by the previous  taxi  statement, lol.&nbsp; My grandmother is going to Duke for some tests on Monday so i have been keeping her records everyday--I feel so bad for her, even though she did call me fat when i was little (sigh).&nbsp; Jess and Nikol have their bet going on--I call Travis, hehe.&nbsp; Oh I also cleaned the  Caddy  today especially for my friends to pimp tomorrow.&nbsp;I had to super glue my rear-view *mirrow* back on because it fell off and was swingin around while&nbsp;I was driving.. uggh..I'm sooo ghetto.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I'm kind of jumping from subject to subject, oh well.&nbsp; My favorite song of the day is: drumroll, please....&nbsp; Dare you to run&nbsp; atleast I think that is what it is called.&nbsp; You can tell I really love it.&nbsp; No word from Chad-- He's too busy for a girlfriend, of course!&nbsp; OH WeLL

        I've been listening to Norah Jones all day..Well, I'm definitely feelin better than i was in my last blog... i was suffering some transition depression... but I'm okay now.&nbsp; Sooo much has happened since then.. I went to New York, registered for school, appeared on  prime time  TV (okay.. so it was like 3seconds on the Today SHow.. but whatever), and ... got some kind of disease from the nail salon.. sounds delightful, right?&nbsp; This morning i went out to breakfast with just the girls --watched sarah turn her coffee into a solid with 10 packs of sugar... and i realized how much i missed them ... I dont know what i will do in college.. but lets not go there again.&nbsp; I also registered for school.. I got good classes, but none with  my monkey  :( tear... I also got a very very crappy parking space.. but atleast i will stay in shape walking with my 100lb bookbag every morning from space 231... grrrr.&nbsp; I miss Chad (still in L.A) hangin out with the BIG stars... sigh, but I'm sooo excited that nikol, jess, and sarah are home.. for good, i hope, for the summer.&nbsp; I'm tired of hearing&nbsp; bull crap  from&nbsp;a particular person of the past.. why won't he just let me rest in peace.. But&nbsp;I realize that&nbsp;(that&nbsp;particular person, who will remain nameless) just wants me back... wah haa haa *evil laugh*... that&nbsp;satisfies my spite... Okay.. i sound horrible, I'll stop hear.&nbsp; Until next time-- &nbsp;

       Well I finally found my cd with Cannon ball on it, yea.  This weekend was awesome--a very nice  break  from school.  This is how it went down... lol..  FRIDAY:  Jessica, Nikol, Chad and I went to eat japanese fast food and saw Princess Diaries 2.  The movie was good, a little corny, but then again it is G rated.  We also went to Applebees to see Sarah and watched Earth Girls are Easy at Chad's.  They're Aliens!!!!  ANNNNYWAY friday was fun.  I don't think I can handle many more  Friday the 13ths ... Jessica hated me all day... sry :( muahhh.  SATURDAY:  The crew went out again, well just to Chad's to watch Kill Bill vol 1 & 2.... muy bien...clase repita, muy bien... okay i tried.  We ate pizza and oreos.   *Note: my apoligies for making ANYONE uncomfortable, I am still in recovery. It won't happen again, pinky promise... and I keep my pinky promises... ahem....*   We later got in the hot tub and Jessica and I (the brave ones) jumped in the pool (while reinacting the scene from Titanic... it was lots of fun).  SUNDAY:  I went to church, ate at Smithfield's with mom, came home, attempted hw, and back to church.  After church (which was very good, i might add) Jess and Kol and I went to Joe's for some  Ice Cream, Ice Cream .. lol.  And now... here I sit... alone in my room... sigh.  Thats okay, I'll get over it.  I love my friends.. and I just know I'm gonna miss them sooooo bad... I wish I could just stop time right here... with Jess, Kol, Chad and Sarah... :(   Song of the day:  Cannon ball , of course.

           Today was not too bad, besides  Calculus  (refer to Nikol's blog). Went to school, went to Jessica's house (refer to Jess's blog), and came home to work on homework and play with Morgan. Because my friends have summarized my life in their own blogs, listen to this dream that I had last night. I'm open for  interpretations :   Okay, Jessica, a mystery man (i think was Blake), Dustin E, and I were all at my house looking at this hill, in the sky, at a trailor park and huge, beautiful house. I get the idea that it would be absolutely wonderful to go to that house (I'm assuming was Dustin's) and look through binoculars to see if I could see my own house... so we go. Then we are all in this restaurant... a mix between CiCi's Pizza and a cafeteria. Well I get to the end of the line and I have no food on my plate, and the lunch lady says: "get whatever u want, i'll take care of it." Then I reply: "No, I have the money, but I just don't know what I want." Then Donna (Nik's mom) who is standing in front of me says: "They have this chicken." I agree and take the chicken. I go to the drink machine, fill up my drink and begin to eat. After we are finished eating the manager of the restaurant comes to sit down in our booth. Note: Chad has now joined my dream. The manager says that we owe him some money because Chad got the orange drink and that is more expensive than the others. While Chad looks confused, I tell the manager that I am NOT paying him more money because there were no signs that said that the orange drink was more than any of the others. Then the manager gets angry and I tell him that he will just have to call the cops... Then I leave. Well, then I drive back to this big house, use the bathroom, and then Dustin tells me that the manager is here and I need to crawl through the window and run from him.... So, then, I decide to just confront him. I go outside and both my car and the manager's car is gone. I ran into the woods, very afraid, and I hear this car coming down the road.... so I face dive into the woods and lay very very very very still... and i woke up...   That is the strangest dream that I have  ever  had. Things that i recognize: 1) You can see a trailor park on a hill from my house. 2) Jessica and Blake have come to my house. 3) I have eaten at both CiCi's Pizza and the school cafeteria recently... and I do eat with Donna a lot on Sundays... and I did fill up mine and Jessica's drinks at CiCi's. 4) Chad's things are usually more expensive, lol. 5) The manager of the bowling alley told us that she was calling the cops on us. 6) I ALWAYS have to use the bathroom. 7) There are woods all around my house. 8) Dustin probably would freak out and tell me to jump through a bathroom window... lol, jk.  *Please help me I'm utterly confused... (I apoligize for any spelling problems :)) My song of the day is: I'm too busy/tired/lazy to look up lyrics... I can't WAIT until  Friday !

       Thats a line from the song  Jessica  wrote which I think is absolutely fantabulous (note:  Nikol ... i know fantastic is not spelled with an "abulous")  Okay... anyway, her song goes right along with my continuous  depressed state .  I'm trying really hard to get out of it, but I'm just toooo frustrated for words right now.  On a lighter note, school wasn't tooo bad today.. no wait, yes it was, Mrs. Cannon assigned 40 new homework problems.  Considering I didnt completely understand the previous 20 AND it took me 2 hrs to do 20... I cant WAIT to do these 40 something, joy.    Pew, pew .  I only saw  Chad  for like 2 seconds today so I didnt get to talk to him :( , but thats okay ~ Just adds to my wonderful outlook on life as a senior :( I really miss talking to him.  I did get to spend my day with Jess though because we have EVERY class together on Bdays... and i can live with that.  Today I went to school, went with Kellie to pick up Austin, started Calculus, ate and ran... exciting.. i know.   Okay, I'm finished  complaining , sorry about that.  Song of the day:  I Miss You  ~Blink 182  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight  I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides  like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me  you're already the voice inside my head   (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)

       Okay, so a lot has happened since I last updated.  I went to school Thursday and Friday and I have a lot of classes with my friends, but still, its school... :( ... Friday I went to the football scimmage with Kol and Jess.  WE WON, can u believe it, okay, so technically you don't keep points in a scrimmage, but we won.. so..... we are counting it!  After the  scrimmage  Chad and Kaci met us at Applebees and then we hung out at  Ryans ... okay that is a little georgia, but whateva!  Chad and I made an important decision, and I am still in recovery... but he seems happy... and thats good.  Then Saturday I went out again with my buds... Leu's (where we were extreamly cheap) and then we splurged at the Melting Pot.  After that we all hung out.... in Chad's bed... lol, and watched  Earth Girls Are Easy ... well some of it.  And today I went to church, went to eat, slept, went to church, went to eat.... Im sooooo adventurous!!!   CHOW!

       This weekend was  wonderful ~I saw my friends everyday of it, but today was boring.  I woke up at 10:30 to get ready to go eat lunch with my mom.  After we ate in Clemson, *note to self: there are NO good restaurants in Clemson* we went to Hallmark where we almost had a wreck with a cute college boy.  My mom was backing up and didnt see him, he yelled, I called him a Jackass and then my mom apoligized.. and he totally changed his attitude... interesting, eh?  When I got home I watched hours of MTV, played with Morgan, worked out, and ate jelly beans... hmm kinda defeats the whole work out, huh?  Anyway, tomorrow is the LAST DAY OF SUMMER... nooooooo!!! This cannot be happening.  I'm now depressed. :( tear*  Okay, I'm over it.  I am a little excited to see my friends, and force Chad to talk to me... waaaa haaa haaa, my evil plan, lol.  I completely  crashed  at about 8:00 but then I woke up at 10:00 and now I'm sooo awake, I hate that.  Oh yea!!! I almost had a wreck today too, imagine that.  I had a yeild sign but the lady who was turning drove like 10ft into my lane, hello??  A yeild sign doesn't mean i should have to back up for you to turn.  Who are these  stupid  drivers... I want to know!  Song of the Day: Slow Motion  by Juvenile... only because it came on TV sooo much I have it stuck in my head.  I hate that song. pew.
