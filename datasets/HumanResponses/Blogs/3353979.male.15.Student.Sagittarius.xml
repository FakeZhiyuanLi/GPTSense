      Today was a boring yet exciting change from the ordinary day. I dident mind being in school today. School life improving, thats a good thing. Im starting to get my life back together.... Everything seemed normal untill the afternoon bus ride, poring rain and thunder, windows down on bus, water pouring into bus, everyone was wild on the bus today, it was a definte change from the ordinary. As for nicki and kristen, well i really dont want to talk to them, they have changeed too much. The rest of my day was spent hanging out at the park not really doing much...........

      Today day started out like any other monday, tired, boring, just waiting for somthing to happen, long day at school, just a boring day. Went to the park nicki,steven,nathan,brian and chris was there. Nicki and kristen have really changed over the past year, there different people, there not the same people i know. They take like as a joke and right now and my life isent a joke, they joke with there feelings and im done joking around, "life is real". Right now i'd give anything to just move far away, a new life, new friends, new everything............

      last night around 8:00 i was at haley and chalces house with steven,nicki,kristen,randall, they dident even notice me, i was little mad, but its just the age difference, "it's easier to live backwords than foreword" because you already lived backwords.

      Normal, somthing we all take for granted untill its gone, its like when your sick your off from school for a few days, at first you dont miss normal, then you start to miss waking up, doing your morning rutine, going to school and maby thers friends you like to talk to and then you go thru out your day, but when normals gone nothing seems to make sense........................

      We all need to be good at somthing, and we all need to know were good a somthing, but what happens when the thing your good at is gone, when you cant be good at it anymore, you feel like a part of you is missing, and after you realize you cant be good at it anymore you go a search to find somthing else you good at, but most of the time its not that easy, you feel like you have to great at every new thing you try or you give up....................

      When i felt sad or angery i would go to a spot on the edge of the woods and just sit there staring into the woods and some how i would feel better, or when i was feeling really bad i would go the club sit back with my feet on the table and look all around, now there is no place to go...........

      The reason why i hide the real me is because of what people would say, today i found out that people do say things, things that make me feel so much worse, i also found out that friends will understand and everyone else will say things,, the only thing that kept me together today was a quote from the book Atlas Shrugged- "Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours."

      in my last post i said i was going to stop my blog but i cant this is the only way i can get everything out. most of time it easier to write it down then to tell someone.  Over the past week i guess i put my life on hold while she was gone, i like her alot and she dosent feel the same way,, i have been quetioning alot of things,, are we friends, i dont know thinking back to winter were we spent months not talking and friends dont do that, friends cant do that.... Every day i feel like i dont belong in rural ridge, and nearly every day somthing happens that keeps me knowing that i dont belong here.......... Every day is find out what i can and can not do, every day i push my self to the limit know the risks and not careing and i do it because i think i can relieve the sadness im feeling, i cant play basketball and know i can play a few weeks ago i could and i know why i cant play its because im play for all the wrong reasons i was playing it because it was fun now i play it to get my mind on somthing else, to not be sad..... Every day i leave with out telling anyone, i leave because i started thinking and im not thinking any happy thoughts................ the music i listen to isnet helping i listen to that describes how i feel and who i am................
