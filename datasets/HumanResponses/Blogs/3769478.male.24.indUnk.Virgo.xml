       PADERBORN   (Panzerland)  -- After nearly three weeks in offline design and development, the forums for Panzerland came online on the 28th. Kaiser Von Wulf happily announced that the forums would now be open to the public, after a private testing phase on various browsers was done to insure compatability. The forums will prove to be a major part of future Panzerlander development, serving as the communications hub of the online-based Empire. Yet the number of sub fora have, thus far, been kept to the bare minimum. A general discussion area, a beer hall for entertainment, the kaiser's court and several other government branches have been established. The Kaiser noted in an interview that a forum for every singular category of government would be wasteful at the present time, but further noted that additional fora may be added if and when they become necessecary. In the meantime, activities will be focused on the present fora and their requisite discussions.  Design of the forums was inspired, in part, by the Kingdom of Gotzborg. Their own astonishingly well-designed forums, designed by the talented HRM King August of Gotzborg, share both cultural and graphical qualities with the designs used in Paznerland. Yet in order not to plagarise the work of His Majesty, only the basic premise of the design was used, such as transparent buildings/cityscapes adorning each forum. Attention of the nation will now be focused from forum and website to more pertinent matters, such as development of the constitution, the national history and gaining more citizens to fill vacant government offices. The Kasier noted, however, that he hopes to hold off on constitutional development until such time as more citizens are available to provide input on its contents. He has instead begun work on the detailed history of Panzerland, of which only the first two chapters are complete. In addition, he has begun an ad campaign to gain more citizens.  Meanwhile, the Kaiser has opened the beer hall to the public and invited anyone who wishes to, to stop by and say hello. Likewise, the Ministry of State is also now open and accepting foreign dignitaries for those who wish to establish diplomatic relations with the Empire. Either way, we hope to see you in Panzerland.   Related Links  Forums  urlLink http://p205.ezboard.com/bpanzerland   Website  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/evilsnapple/

        The Empire of Panzerland was formed today in an official ceremony headed by His Majesty, Kaiser Ryszard Von Wulf, the first Emperor of Panzerland. The Empire was formed out of the ashes of the failed Virtual City of Netropolis project, which was cancelled due to unforseen obstacles, most unfortunately. In lieu of this project, Netropolitan Duke Ryan was re-christened with a heritage&nbsp;German name at the Cathedral in Aachen as Ryszard Von Wulf. With the Von Wulf assets established and other business agreements brought to closure, Ryszard purchased a division of Panzers with his own money, a parcel of land, and established the foundations of Panzerland. Embracing the noble military teachings of such great men as Erwin Rommel and Manfred Von Richthofen, a basis for the Empire was drawn up and organised.  Panzerland will fall under an administration echoing military organisation and a chain of command similar to that of an army. The Emperor rules absolute, with a close circle of advisors and staff. This is not to say, however, that Panzerland will be entirely without a voice for its people. The Emperor has assured the public that there will be a legislature established in which the public can make a difference in the affairs of government. Military and the art or war will, though, remain the dominant moving force behind Panzerlander society. After all, when literally translated, Panzerland means "Armor Land", and indeed, Panzerlanders are an armored people. More details on the progress of Panzerland will be posted as it becomes available.

       PADERBORN   (Panzerland)  -- The Republic of Slobovia officially became Panzermannsch Slobowien this week when Kaiser Von Wulf concluded the deal with Slobovian President Troy Thompson to make the nation a protectorate of the empire.  The ruling was made in the form of a decree issued by the Kaiser, which sets the rules and stipulations by which Slobovia will be governed whilst it is part of Panzerland. This includes guarantees of maintaining territorial integrity and recognising Troy Thompason as the leader-in-absence of the nation. Upon Mr. Thompson's return to micronationalism - of which the details have not been specified - Slobovia will be allowed to determine its own path. Be it a resumption of independence or in maintaining its affiliation with Panzerland.  In the meantime, the Panzerlander government has assumed control of all Slobovian state assets and government offices. These will be incorporated into the imperial government  and Panzerland will attempt to rejuvinate Slobovian foreign affairs and treaties, upholding them as if they were signed by the Kaiser himself. Future foreign affairs will, however, be directed by Paderborn. Kaiser Von Wulf has chosen Don Diego de Almagro to hold the position of Slobovian Steward while it remains a protectorate. Mr. Amagro has been hired by the government via a worker visa, and thus does not hold citizenship. But his past record shows him to be an experienced leader and he is sure to prove an apt choice to guard the Slobovians while their leader is away.

       KREISAU   (Panzerland)  -- The Republic of Slobovia entered negotiations this week with the Empire of Panzerland over the possibility of becoming a protectorate. With most of its citizens having gone inactive, the fate of Slobovia has been questioned abroad. Slobovia, which has been declining in activity since it seceded from the Arminian Community over two months ago, culminated in its slow-down with the announcement by President Troy Thompson that the nation would be "making serious changes". These revolved around Mr. Thompson's own departure, albeit temporary, from micronations for an unspecified amount of time.  This prompted Kaiser Von Wulf, at one time a Slobovian himself, to speak with President Thompson about the future of the Slobovians. As it would turn out, Mr. Thompson was seeking a friendly state of similar interests to establish a protectorate over Slobovia while he is away. Such a protectorate would have to, of course, guarantee the territorial integrity of the nation and make assurances that upon the return of the President, Slobovia be allowed to determine its own future. Von Wulf has made these assurances and has entered into stronger negotiations with Thompson in order to finalise the deal.  These negotiations are continuing and are expected to culminate in a formal protectorate treaty being signed between the two nations and Slobovia becoming the Panzermannsch Protectorate of Slobowien within the next few weeks. More information on this event will be posted as it becomes available.
