       So. It's friday afternoon, and I have less than an hour of work left, and I'm bored as hell because I managed to finish everything I needed to do, and I'm too much of a chicken to ask the bloke in charge whether I can skive off home. He'd probably say yes, but it'd go against the efficient, professional image I need to project right now. So.  Since I seem to be using this as a place to write down things without expecting anyone to read them, I figure that I may as well write about what I'm thinking about right now. I don't think I have significant, earth-shattering things to say. I couldn't care less about Iraq, or the American elections. It took me quite a while to realise that Bush is running again. We don't have a tv right now, so I tend to be a bit out of touch unless I remember to look at the online newspapers in the mornings. I've been thinking about home recently. It tends to happen round about this time of the year. It's been seven months since I was last at home, which is, as far as I can remember, the longest I've been away. Even when I was at varsity I tended to go home every couple of months, even if it was just for the day. It's quite easy when it's just two hours away. Not too taxing petrol or time-wise. Right now it would take around 11 hours to get home, assuming that bits don't fall off my car on the way there. The petrol would cost around R700 (divide by 6 to get dollars). It's not exactly an option even if I had the money to spare right now, since I'd get to spend a maximum of 36 hours there before having to come back to be at work monday morning.  Nah. I'll just wait patiently for christmas. My parents live, and have lived since the early 70's, in a three bedroom house half an hour's drive outside of Port Elizabeth along the coast towards Cape Town. That doesn't really mean much for anyone not South African. Port Elizabeth is fairly easy to find. Get hold of a map of the southern bit of Africa, and find South Africa. That's very easy. It's the big bit right at the bottom. Anything short of a truly useless map will at least show Johannesburg and Cape Town. Maybe Durban and Bloemfontein too. Port elizabeth is ahlfway along the coast between Cape Town and Durban. There are two little hookish bays around there. The left one is St Francis Bay, the right one is Algoa Bay, and the cape between them is where Port Elizabeth starts, curving around Algoa Bay. My parents' house is on the left side of the cape, PE on the right. I grew up with the sound of the sea. Very poetic, and all that, but also completely true. If you run very fast and don't trip on the rough path, you can get from my bedroom window to the start of the rockpools in about 30 seconds. It takes longer if the dogs join you, because they tend to get in the way. Funnily enough, it takes longer as you get older. You'd expect it to be a shorter trip [heheh] as your legs get longer, but I think that nothing compares, speedwise, to a child who's just flung off a school uniform, yanked on a costume, spent all of half a second assessing the swimmability of the rockpools, grabbed a mask, bucket and net and jumped out of the window because using doors takes too long. Legs blurring, dogs going insane, leaping over various thing on the path [including the occasional sunning snake, branches, mad ants, dogs, bits of rock]. Brilliant. Towels completely optional. If you weren't dry by the time you panted your way back up the path, then it probably wasn't really warm enough to swim. Amazing how much longer that path seems on the way back up compared to the blurred landscape on the way down. I had many, many longing thoughts of a little chairlift, just for me, that would whisk me serenely up the path, buckets, nets, mask, towel and all. Right. Hometime.

       I dreamt last night. That's fairly odd, because I tend not to dream these days unless I'm drowsing in bed on a weekend morning. This one was especially odd. I think my mind must have been doing some really odd things because I've been trying to figure this one out, and I've come up with squat so far. So it went like this: My mom was pregnant with her third child. This in itsself is odd, because my mother is in her fifties, and hasn't had a womb for a very long time now. I was the age I am now. My elder brother appeared in the dream, not really doing much.  At one point, my mother was lying on her right side, with her pregnant belly exposed. There must have been a light behind it, because it looked almost like a water balloon. I could see the fliud moving inside it.&nbsp;I couldn't see the baby, which may have been a good thing. We were in a hospital at the time. I don't know why. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the pregnancy.  My mother went into labour, but very disturbing labour. Her stomach looking like there was a minor earthquake taking place inside. It was moving so fast that it was blurring. My brother went off with my mother so that she could give birth. I stayed behind in the room that we had been sitting in, and starting packing up my mother's luggage. There was a huge pile of it, and most of the contents of the bags was strewn over the floor. I was still grabbing handfuls and ramming them into the bags when my mother came back. I don't know how much time had passed since she had left. She handed me something very small, tightly wrapped in cloth, so that nothing of it showed, and proudly told me that his name was Elijah. It definitely wasn't a baby, though. I didn't undo the cloth, but the shape looked quite a lot like the shape of an Oscar statuette, without the base. I woke up.

       Right, so, as previously mentioned, I live in South Africa. I get the feeling that the common perception of South Africa goes something along the lines of "nelson mandela, lions, apartheid". Cape Town may appear on that list, and I'm not entirely sure about the apartheid bit. I think that was more true a few years back. We're supposed to be all reformed now, rainbow nation buddies striving to rebuild the country etc etc. Personally, I'm not too sure how we're actually doing. I've heard that I live in the carjacking and rape capital of the world, or something similar. It feels like there's this very fragile layer of niceness overlaying something rather nasty and much less friendly. My dad says that we're basically living in a third world country with a veneer of first-world-ness, and sometimes it really feels like that. Anyone disputing it is more than welcome to go spend some time with the subsistence farmers down the Transkei coast. Very friendly people, with no money, electricity, sanitation, and very few schools and hospitals. The problem that follows on from that is the mass migration of people from the totally underdeveloped rural areas to the cities, which means an influx of unskilled, uneducated people into areas that were never meant to cope with that. Result, huge squatter camps on the outskirts of the cities, and massive unemployment. I think we're sitting at something like 60% at the moment. There are probably tons of other factors that I'm leaving out, but I'm pretty sure that that's a fairly accurate simplified view. And I won't even try to bring the aids problem into it. I had a severely rascist landlord while I was at varsity who took much pleasure in quoting figures and statistics at me regarding, basically, how many blacks are going to die in the next five years. Bit of a nasty obsession, but I think he was having quite a lot of trouble with stock theft on his farm at the time. Not much of an excuse, but it's about the best I'll come up with for now. Nelson Mandela seems like a very nice old bloke. And that a bit of a problem... he spent the prime of his life in prison, and now all he wants to do is retire. And people seem to need him. Things are going to get interesting when he dies.  And the lions... Not in our back gardens. Not wandering down main streets. All in zoos or in nature reserves, learning how to destroy car tyres.

       First post... This could be anything. Really bad because the person hasn't figured out what to say, or really good but tailing off because they suddenly had something urgent to say, or rather mediocre, probably like this one. Preliminaries.... I'm 24, female and living in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am of caucasian descent [nice way of saying "i'm so white you should call me Hilda and hand me a hat with horns"], fairly overweight and still fairly scared of having to be an adult. I don't know whether what I write is particularly readable. My high school english teachers seemed to think so, but my ill-conceived year as a journalism student met with such utter indifference from my tutors that I really have no idea. I doubt anybody will read this, but I used to enjoy writing, so I think I'll give it a go. I have no other reason for starting a blog. I don't really know what to write about. Guess I'll make it up as I go along. Cheers Jen

        There are a couple of things I've learnt in the past year-and a half of working. Some of them are puzzling, and some are just annoying.  The first one, and so far the biggest taboo topic I've come across, is salaries. Colleagues will  never  tell you exactly how much they're earning. They'll all use vague amounts, if any, and then it's up to you to perform some mental arithmetic and figure out where everyone is on the ladder.  So if Bob earns twice and much as Ted, who gets paid a biiit more than I do...  and so on and so on. I've made the mistake of telling a colleague once what my salary was. Very big mistake. I had just been hired to perform the same function as him, at a salary that was exactly twice his. I didn't know this until I casually asked him what he was earning, which provoked a tirade against our employer, since he was being paid at something rather a lot nastier than minimum wage. He told me, in a very tightly controlled voice, that his girlfriend's father was buying groceries for them, since he couldn't afford anything other than rent. And then came the question that really broke things... "Well, how much is he paying  you ?"  D'oh.  I couldn't lie. I had to tell him that our employer had offered me an absolute pittance, but a pittance which was still twice what he was earning. Of course, the first thing he did was to go have a rather nasty conversation with the boss about the salary discrepancy. Not good. I was not the apple of his eye any more. I was that bloody interfering woman.  Salaries irritate me constantly. In a reversal of fortunes, I get paid half of what a person who is performing the same function as me is getting. I'm not too sure where I went wrong. Perhaps I should have held out for a better starting salary right at the beginning, but at that point I was so happy to actually have a job that the thought of delaying, even by an hour, was not popping up in my head.  If salaries are calculated according to the person's usefulness, then we should be getting the same amount of money. If they're based on experience, then he wins a bit. If on qualifications, I win. If on need, then we should be about equal. Although he has a wife and child, his wife works, and I have a year and a bit's worth of study loans to get rid of.  My boyfriend earns more than twice what I do, but I tend to be less irritated about that. He's extremely skilled, and a very good problem solver. He also working during holidays for his company for a couple of years while studying. Not that I'm absolutely fine with it. Just less irritated by it than by my colleague.  The other taboos I've come across are more normal. Don't talk about religion. Don't talk about politics. I know what the religious leanings of 1 of the people I share this office with are. The rest, not a clue.     There's something I need to put down here, and it's about souls. Nothing religious. I don't have one. While waiting for interminable FTP sessions to complete over the last couple of days, I've been browsing ghost photos. They're really interesting. Most of them are of orbs and funny lights, which doesn't really do it for me. Most of them look too much like camera failure or odd lighting conditions. The ones that make me go slightly chilly are the humanoid ones. The half-formed bodies, and hands and staring eyes.  I tend to regard myself as a rational person. I have problems identifying with any religion because I do not believe in god, or gods, or demons or anything else that goes along with that. There should be really good reasons why those photographs look like that. But I'm not finding them. I don't know enough about the circumstances of each photo to be able to say "yes, well, they left it on long exposure and someone wandered through and that's why there's a blurry human-shaped blob in the middle." Wish I could, but I can't.  And there's something that happened to my mom a couple of years ago that seems to have affected her a bit. She was nursing an old friend of hers, who was in the last stages of dying from skin cancer. He was at his sister's house, and mom drove up to help out for the last few days. He didn't last long; about 48 hours after he got there he died. But it was what happened right after he died that seemed to freak my mom out a bit. She said that he was lying in bed in a room with the curtains drawn, as he was fairly sensitive to light. The curtains weren't very heavy, and were blowing in the breeze a bit. More to the point, the wind outside was pushing against them, so that they were bulging inward slightly. Mom said that as David finally died, they blew the other way, just for a second. She likened it to something leaving the room, going out through the curtain. I don't know. I really don't.
