      I expect you have all heard of the anglican bishop, Rev Stephen Lowe, who wanted the popular hymn "I Vow to Thee My Country" banned due to 'increased nationalism'. It's extraordinary. For those of you who don't know the hymn (I didn't myself, being not too religious in any faith), here it is:  I vow to thee, my country - all earthly things above Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love; The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test, That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best; The love that never falters, the love that pays the price, The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice. And there's another country, I've heard of long ago Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know; We may not count her armies, we may not see her King; Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering; And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase, And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.  "I'm saying it's important to think about what we are singing. The words were written after WW1 when millions had died. They were meant to reassure people they would go to Heaven. "There's nothing wrong with Christians being patriotic but you cannot say the country has to be supported even if it's wrong."  Fair enough, I hear you say. But does a hymn being sung mean you 'have' to support what it's saying? Nobody's coming at you with a knife, just to make sure you sing it and salute your country. He also comments on Euro 2004. He says that nationalism "was evident during the Euro 2004 football tournament". Nationalism? Being patriotic, you mean. Sorry, I forgot we weren't allowed to do that. The whole of Greece was in euphoria for 7 days after they won it - they drank to excess, landlords gave out free drinks all week, even to foreigners, and there was partying until late out in the streets. Therefore, we're not allowed to even put a flag up, according to this bishop.  What's different with this country? Why can't we do the same as everybody else and be proud of our nation, of what it achieves, even what it fails in? Seems to me we're just one large mass of fear. A foreigner mouthes off at a passer by, you have a go at them, and you're called a racist. Sure. The fact that they're just being a right moron seems to pass them by - you know you'd say exactly the same to a person of your own race, but that doesn't matter anymore to this country. We pussyfoot around and let anyone do what they want, just in case we get some backlash. Other countries obviously use this to their advantage.  France don't need worry about asylum seekers anymore - send them over to Britain and they won't be able to quibble.  Anyway, what do you think? Is showing support for a national team wrong? Is the term 'nationalist' too widely used to represent anyone who is proud of their country? And is that wrong in itself? The case continues.
