       it's sunday morning!&nbsp; which means i'm off this dreaded island tomorrow for two whole weeks!&nbsp; *glee*&nbsp; i was going to pack last night but i ended up watching  friends  after showering.&nbsp; i tiptoed off to bed after the show.&nbsp; but it's not that bad.&nbsp; i've finished most of the  handycam  booklet by now.&nbsp; i'm at the "troubleshooting" part now, which usually means the booklet&nbsp;is coming to an end (go me!).  lan, michelle and tsai wanted go out and have dinner today, probably something fancy at Idee.&nbsp; i decided not to go and told them i'd have dinner with them when i get back.&nbsp; i think my family is going out to eat tonight and it'd be really weird if it were the three of them going without me.&nbsp; the four of us are usually glued together (not always by choice, mind you).&nbsp; apart from my dad's solitary trips to&nbsp;the mainland&nbsp;for work&nbsp;from time to time, we always travel together.  two weeks is a long time...&nbsp; i think i'm going to miss everyone.&nbsp; when we graduated, i thought i was going to be fine; i didn't even cry nor feel the tiniest bit of resentment.&nbsp; it wasn't until after going to the KTV with lan and the rest and pei jun's party on wednesday when i started missing them.&nbsp; *sniffles*&nbsp; and i'm going to miss jay, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;*lol*&nbsp; we spend so much time talking on msn.&nbsp;  yeah, i better start packing.&nbsp; i waste too much time rambling.       edit:  i'm still not done packing.&nbsp;*grumbles*&nbsp; &nbsp;

       new blog, fresh start.  i'm not going to care about my blog's popularity anymore (which was a big issue at  bloop  and  the open diary ), nor will i fuss with html  (something i really suck at).  i just want a simple-looking blog to ramble on when i need an emotional outlet.   i've been so indolent lately.  neglecting to read the  handycam    instruction book.  dad entrusted me with the task of learning to use the  handycam   last week.  it is now two days (counting today) before we leave for vacation and the instruction book is still half unread.  i feel kind of disgusted with myself :(    however disgusted i am with myself, i'm still going shopping with my mom today.  we're going to Tai Mall :)  the handycam crap will have to wait until i get home.        edit:   Tai Mall was nauseating.  i hate public places that are filled with people, especially shrieking kids.

       I have been living an unhealthy lifestyle lately. Usually online until 1:30 AM, I manage to force myself to sleep by 2 AM, and finally find myself awake about 11 hours later, at 1 PM. Rather upsetting that I need a startling 11 hours of sleep while I usually only get 6 hours of sleep during the semester. Adding to my strange sleep routine, I eat irregularly (well duh, since I wake up so late in the day!), and hardly exercise. The only exercises I do now are: one, getting from my room to the living room couch to watch whatever is on TV; and two, getting up from my desk to change a CD that was playing in my hi-fi.    The movie I saw this afternoon was  Maid In Manhattan .   I give it a B-. I'd give it a C for the highly-predictable storyline that makes you go, "aww, not that shit again," but I rather like Ralph Fiennes, the Romeo in the movie :) He is most definitely a sign of British sexuality :) Jennifer Lopez is actually somewhat convincing on her role. She is a better actress than Britney Spears and Mariah Carey put together!   While I'm at it, I'll do another movie review (lol). I watched  Bend It Like Beckham  the other night. Good comedy! I give it an A, and yes, the main guy in the movie (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer) did help promote the movie to this grade! (Sorry, guys with accents -- especially British and Irish...  Are irresistible to me!)  I don't have any complaints about this movie, except that the cameo of Beckham and his lovely wife, Victoria, was too short.     That is all for today.  The critic is off to take a shower...

       No, I wouldn't say that I'm in my spunky mood today, therefore I erased the foolish "moo's happy hour" shit from my first entry. I can't stand to be corny or "38" when I'm in my ordinary self.   I've been back from the mainland for a week (got back last Monday). Why haven't I updated since then? An insincere thanks to the creator of the bug that crippled my laptop for days, leaving me immobile to the e-world throughout that period.   Hopefully, I can get some research done today. I've made sure that I appear  invisible  to anyone on my MSN and Yahoo messenger lists, so I don't get bombarded with a load of messages like I was yesterday (not that I'm complaining...).   I'm so glad that Tony Wu and I are friends again! Before graduation, I stuck my nose up in the air and refused to talk to him anymore because I thought our friendship was getting nowhere, just worse. Fully appreciative that he mustered up enough courage to talk to me again on our A-level class trip to Tamshui, Taipei, I will give him a hug next time I see him! We talked online yesterday night... he broke up with his girlfriend 小綠, but is extremely happy that we're best buddies again.   Speaking of breaking up, quite a few people have been reporting to me of breaking up with their other half! Excuse me, if I'm not mistakened, Chinese Valentine's Day is nearing -- are you guys just too broke to splurge for that ultra romantic candlelight dinner or is Cupid playing tricks on ya?! Gosh, this is sad. It is sad because many break ups are not of mutual agreement; someone (if not both) gets hurt in the process. Oh well, at least there's one person to be happy for: Jay. Jay is terribly in love now :) Go Jay! Haha :)   Anyway, I am supposed to go to Cashbox KTV today. But I'm not going. I'm terrified by the prospect of singing in front of a room full of people, even with the lights dimmed and everyone woozy from the alcohol. I'll go next time though, I kind of enjoy laying on the couch, eating tiramisu and listening to my friends belt out their off-key version of "Fly Away," even if it means wasting $300 NT :o)
