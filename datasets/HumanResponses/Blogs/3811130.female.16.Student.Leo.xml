      A rose is beautiful to look at,no matter what colour it is, The earth sometimes smells of sweet grass after a rainfall, But as the rose has thorns on its stem,so the earth can smell of rotten, leaves and other things too.  All that exist have two sides: pro and con, The sun rises from the east and sets in the west. We are born to life,yet we are bound to death, And in between life and death,we all strive. Some of us try to choose,others just drift by.  There are people who say they believe in God, There are others who only believe what they see, And these are those who simply believe in truth, Some say if we are good,we can go to heaven, And if we are bad,we will go to hell.  Some say no one has died and returned, Some don't care:they only want to enjoy life, Some fear going to hell:they never live, To live is not only to breath,eat,sleep,enjoy,get married or be single. It is so much more.  To live is to hope,even when there's no hope, To live is to try to smile,even when your heart aches, To live is to put aside injuries and roach your goal, To live is to believe in something greater than you or me or then, The One Who exists beyond limits.  And to live is simply to endure,to do what we can,pray for guidance, love others as  kindred and try to be happy, And dream of wonderful things, God knows what is good for us, Some of those dreams might just come true.
