        Gay Student Expelled for Being Gay   A Christian School in Palm Beach, FL expelled Jefferey Woodard, 18, for being gay.  Nowhere in the rules of the school did it say it was a violation of school policy to be gay, and they didn't even give a legitimate explanation of why they expelled him.

        God put Bush in office?  Thats odd... I wonder why he didn't tell  me .   The General leading us in the much-maligned war against terrorism thinks his God is bigger than bin Laden's.  William Boykin believes that Allah is a false idol.  He also claims that Bush won the presidency because God wanted him to.  "Why is this man in the White House? The majority of Americans did not vote for him. He's in the White House because God put him there for a time such as this."  Read the full story  urlLink here.

        Mississippi Gubernatorial Candidate Supports Racism?   Republican gubernatorial candidate Haley Barbour was seen at a Council of Conservative Citizens fundraising cookout recently.  The CofCC is a fiercely radical organization that denies the holocaust and defends racism.  It's amazing how idiotic this guy was for appearing at this fundraiser.  And it would be even more astonishing if this dumbass wins the election.  If that happens, we need to take Mississippi back with force and appoint the Rev. Jesse Jackson as their governor. =)  See the picture on  urlLink www.cofcc.org   Looking around the site, I found a few photos of the members.  One of them was a pastor...

      From the World Socialist Web Site:   An October 12 report by Patrick Cockburn in The Independent draws attention to how US soldiers in Iraq bulldozed groves of date palms and orange and lemon trees in central Iraq as part of a new policy of collective punishment of farmers who refuse to inform on guerrillas attacking US troops.  The action taken last month beside the road at Dhuluaya, a small town 50 miles north of Baghdad, destroyed the livelihood of 32 farmers and their families.  The children of one woman who owned some fruit trees lay down in front of a bulldozer but were dragged away, according to eyewitnesses. When a reporter from Iraq Today attempted to take a photograph of the bulldozers at work a soldier grabbed his camera and tried to smash it. One farmer told Cockburn, “They made a sort of joke against us by playing jazz music while they were cutting down the trees...”    urlLink Read the full story.

      America has been taken over by the right-wing media that spins lies and distortions out into the mainstream.  This blog will bring you news that you won't read in a conservative paper, and will also expose those lies for what they are.  Conservatives have taken over our media... choosing what they want for us to read.  Me, or Zach as i call myself, am sick and tired of this shit.  The left has been taking it and taking from the right, cheapshots and all.  Now it's time to expose all the sickening truths of the right and the Bush Administration.

        Democracy Fading Away   This past week, a horribly awful medicare bill passed the senate.  The republicans used some dirty tricks to get it passed though.  Somehow, they broke house rules and made the vote stay open for nearly 3 hours.  Finally, a few of the republican congressmen changed their votes to the dark side.  When it went to the senate, 11 of our "Democratic" senators voted for the ill-fated bill.  Did any of the congressmen raise a stink? NO! Did anyone say "wait a minute, you can't do that!"? NO! This is truly the early signs of our democracy fading away.   urlLink Read the full story.

        America's Worst President on a Dime   Conservatives everywhere are now wanting to kick FDR off the dime and add an image of Reagan.  This is totally ridiculous and unneeded. FDR was one of the best presidents.  He introduced Social Security and the New Deal in order to get us out of the Great Depression.  He also started tons of federal programs to help people get jobs.  Reagan fired all those striking airline workers, spent gov't money on nothing but the military (while ignoring the slumping economy), and nominated some of the most radical supreme court justices we've ever seen.

        A Joke   One day George W. Bush and Dick Cheney walk into a diner. A waitress walks up to them and asks if she can take their order. Bush leans close to her and says, "Honey, can I have a quickie?"    The waitress is appalled and yells at the President about women's rights and storms away.       Cheney then says to Bush, "George, its pronounced 'quiche'."   Thanks to Nick

And on the list of the 50  cities  getting the most money, New York City is number 49th in money per person.  Who's number one on the city list?  FUCKING NEW HAVEN!!!!

        Government Should Stay Out Of Marriage Completely, Educated Individual Reports   I found this quote on the Charlie Rose Show message board.  It's a great argument for Gay Marriage that I've never heard before:  "I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me what the U.S. Government is doing dabbling in "marriage" at all, gay or otherwise. If we truly have division of Church and State, then the Government has no business regulating religious ceremonies/rites. For a Civil Union, what else is required besides a contract between the people involved?  As a single person, who expects to remain single for the remainder of my life, I find it very unfair that the Government has habitually used "coupledom" to legislate and condone discrimination, very costly discrimination, against those who have chosen to live their lives unpartnered.  If every citizen of the United States were truly treated with totally impartial equality, there would be no issue here at all. Those who wished to live as couples would either go to their church for a religious ceremony or to their lawyer for a contract, or both. Certainly no need to amend the Constitution, to resolve an issue which was never within the rightful domain of government at all."  Board thread  urlLink here.

        Former Bush Administration Cabinet Member Reveals the Truth   Richard Clarke, former chief of counterterrorism under Bush, was questioned by the independent 9/11 panel today.  He stated that the Bush administration did little with the intelligence given to them to thwart the attacks.  He also issued an apology to the families of 9/11 victims:   "Your government failed you, and I failed you.  We tried hard, but that doesn't matter because we failed you.  And for that failure, I would ask, once all the facts are out, for your understanding and for your forgiveness."   This is not the first time a former Bush administration official has come out against them.

        Court Close to Landmark Decision in Pledge Case   The arguments in Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow were heard today.  If you didn't know, this is the case dealing with the issue of removing "Under God" from the pledge of allegiance.  Michael Newdow won in the lower courts, claiming since he was an atheist that he didn't want his daughter saying God in school.  The school district appealed, and the Supreme Court heard the case today.  At first I wasn't really sure weather i support removing it or not.  But now, i'm leaning more toward removing it, if for nothing more than to agree with previous precedents.  This would go along with past precedents involving the Ten Commandments in public places.  It may take awhile for the court to issue a decision.   urlLink Here's the link.

        Two people who love each other getting  MARRIED ??? NOO!!!!!   The same sex marriage movement has hit Oregon.  The Multnomah County Commissioner  has issued several Same Sex Marriage licenses to over 50 people.  Also, New York's Attorney General has issued a statement about the Marriages that are happening in upstate New York.  He says, "I personally would like to see the law changed, but must respect the law as it now stands."   It's refreshing to see that he wants it changed, but in the civil rights movement of the 60's you didn't see Blacks saying "I would like integration to happen, but we must respect segregation."  Martin Luther King, Jr. said in his "Letter From Birmingham Jail" that if a law is unjust, it must be broken.  Banning of gay marriages creates second class citizens.  It's no worse than segregation.  And why the hell doesn't John Kerry have the balls to say that?  Read the full story  urlLink here.

The trial of two former TYCO execs, who were accused of looting $600 million from the company and thousands of shareholders, ended in a mistrial today.

        Hubert Selby, Jr. Dies at 75   This is a bit unrelated, but I must comment.  Hubert Selby was one of my favorite authors, if not my favorite.  He wrote the book  Requiem For A Dream , and his most famous  Last Exit To Brooklyn .  It makes me sad to think of a world without him.  His dark imagery with which he wrote about "the other America," was totally unique and unrelenting.  His jumbled writing style where speech was not separated from the narrative was brilliant and sparked more imagination than any other author.  He was depressed much of his life, except while writing.  He loved his craft.  He died in his home with family by his side.  Selby was afflicted with chronic pulmonary disease. He will be lost but not forgotten.

        Nightline Controversy   So I don't have to explain what this is about, here is what I will be commenting on:  urlLink Click here.   I live in one of the areas (Anderson, SC) where the nightline broadcast was kept off the air by the Sinclair Broadcast Group.  SBG demanded that WLOS 13 in Asheville, NC and it's seven other affiliates not air Nightline tonight.  However, i have to commend WHNS Fox Carolina for airing the broadcast on their channel.  I'm glad they had the courage to do this. This was a disgusting move by the Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBG) to choose not to air it on their 8 ABC affiliates.  They claim that the nightline program was politically motivated.  However, I believe  SBG's  decision  not  to air the program was politically motivated.  For one, they donate 98% of their political money to Republicans if that's any indication.  And added to that, where do they get the balls to pull it off the air?  Was this episode indecent? No. Was it vulgar? No.  Was it risque? No.  The people should be able to choose whether they want to watch it or not.  While watching the program, I was astonished at how I never realized the sacrifice that went along with this war.  I was moved to tears a few times during the show.  I sat there thinking "these people had wives, children, grandchildren."  I saw one picture of a man holding a baby.  Some were donning graduation caps (these hit me the hardest), and were only 18 years old.  I would like to say thanks to nightline for this moving memorial.  I don't believe that this show was done for political reasons.  This memorial was not created in order to bulid sentiment against the war.  It was a memorial to the sacrifice given for this unneeded and idiotic war, plain and simple.

I can't fucking believe this guy.  This is just gonna make teens wear condoms less, but they will still fuck on a regular basis, and now, will still transmit diseases on a regular basis.  Jesus fucking christ!!!!! Here's a little message to all you conservative mother fuckers: IF YOU WANT KIDS TO STOP FUCKING, THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE GOING TO SUCCEDE IS BY KILLING OR CASTRATING THEM!!!! Or tell them to masturbate.  Christ, they act like "masturbating is a sin, and is unholy."  98% PERCENT OF THE FUCKING POPULATION JERKS OFF!!!!  Not educating them about condoms and gutting AIDS education funding is not gonna stop the spread of disease.  Abstinence education is bullshit.  How many teens do you think listen to that shit, the pimply freaks who don't get any anyway? When someone is in the heat of passion, do you think they'll say "Fuck it! My teacher said 'NO SEX!' FUCK NO!  They're gonna be fucking anyway, might as well *try* to prevent diseases and teenage pregnancy by giving them condoms, for christ sakes.   urlLink Bush is a pussy here.

        Bill O'Reilly is more than a  urlLink blubbering vagina,  he's a racist/genocidal maniac.   Bill O'Reilly thinks we should "bomb the living daylights out of them."  "Them" being the Iraqis.  He also believes that they are "a prehistoric group."   urlLink Read Here.

       Know what? Fuck it.  Reagan doesn't deserve anything nice said about him.  I retract the previous statement.

        The Gipper is dead.   I tried to think of something nice to say about Reagan.  It was hard, but here we go.  Horrible president, great orator.   He had the talent of making someone laugh, in the uneasiest of moments.  That's all I could think of.  Reagan was probably the worst president ever.  Millions of people still haven't gotten their trickle-down dollar. Greg Palast sums Reagan up pretty well in  urlLink this article.   In other news, Fahrenheit 9/11 is opening wide on June 25th.  Check for showtimes at  urlLink www.f911tix.com   I bid you adieu.

       Hornswaggled!   &nbsp;  I just realized it:&nbsp; I've been duped by FOX and the other members of the Right-Wing mainstream media.&nbsp; I'd heard the term "Flip-Flopper" so much in reference to John Kerry, I actually believed it.&nbsp; While still not my favorite candidate, Kerry is not the Wishy-Washy guy they want you to believe he is.&nbsp; Bush is actually a much bigger "flip-flopper" than Kerry has ever been, according to a Salon.com article:  &nbsp;  "In September 2001, Bush said capturing bin Laden was 'our No. 1 priority.' By March 2002, he was claiming, 'I don't know where he is. I have no idea and I really don't care. It's not that important.'   In October 2001, he was dead set against the need for a Department of Homeland Security. Seven months later, he thought it was a great idea.   In May 2002, he opposed the creation of the 9/11 commission. Four months later, he supported it.   During the 2000 campaign, he said that gay marriage was a states' rights issue: "The states can do what they want to do." During the 2004 campaign, he called for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.

        Sign It, Damn You   Tom Mauser (the guy who's son was killed at Columbine and appeared in Bowling For Columbine) has started a petition to extend the ban on assault weapons.  He apparently chose me (and about 35 other bloggers) to send out the message and get out the vote, I guess.  I'm kind of flabbergasted by this.  Why would he and his Petition team choose little old me for this?  Whatever... just sign it, yo.  Guns are really really bad... especially these kind.   urlLink Go here for some petition MADNESS!!!!

        W. Ketchup offers choice for all!   A company has introduced a new type of Ketchup dubbed "W Ketchup."  They are blatantly right-leaning.  I don't care that they are, they can lean whatever fucking way they want, but they are serious hypocrites.  W. Ketchup is supposed to be an alternative to Heinz ketchup (Because Kerry's wife is the heiress to the Heinz fortune).  The company takes pride in being American made, claiming Heinz has 57 factories in foriegn countries (I don't know if that number is correct, but it's probably not far off). Yet, the causes they overtly lean to (Republicans, anyone?) support, and are in the pocket of, big business.  Corporations like GM, Nike, etc... often close their factories in America and move to 3rd world countries.  Actually, Nike has no factories in America anymore. So basically, by supporting the Republicans, W Ketchup just sends more jobs out of the USA.  In my opinion, Heinz is most likely like all corporations: greedy.  Kerry's wife was, actually, at one time married to Republican senator John Heinz (Who died).  And Kerry was not my choice for the Democratic ticket.  He voted for NAFTA, and is not the most Liberal guy around.  But he is the lesser of two evils.  I'm not defending Kerry, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy.  See how dumb these assholes can be?
