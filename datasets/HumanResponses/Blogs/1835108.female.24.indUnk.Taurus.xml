      Yesterday after having left a post I actually did start packing.  I got two boxes done and then got called into work.  When I got there I picked up one patient.  He had just had a heart attack, got two stents and I was going to pull out the catheter from his artery (we do this a lot).  I was thinking ok, this won't be such a bad day.  Well then I picked up a second patient...he was very hard of hearing and very confused.  To make a long story really short...it ended up being a really frustrating day.  But it ended well...I got to go home early.  So yes indeed I not only went in late, but I got to leave early.  So you are probably thinking that I got a lot of packing done when I got home early.  Nope, none.  Today is a day off for me and I have big plans to pack.  I will let you know how that goes.  Did I ever mention that I truly HATE packing. On another note.  I went to my brother-in-laws house this morning.  I had the pleasure of giving him the news that his ex-girlfriend (of 4 months) whom he dated for nearly 8 years is now engaged and planning a wedding for May.  Unbelieveable...yes.  And I felt absolutley horrible giving him this news.  But he knows that I am still friends with her and if he heard it through the grape vine I know that he would wonder why I hadn't told him.  My point is that I now feel like shit because he probably feels like shit.   I must move away from the computer now and do something that will help with our move out of this place.

      Although today is one of my regularly scheduled days at the hospital I am on call.  They are probably over staffed or don't have enough patients in the unit.  This all works well for me.  Usually on an on call day it goes like this...the alarm goes off at 5:15 a.m, I hit snooze until 5:45 a.m.  Somewhere between 5:30 and 6 a.m someone from the scheduling office at work calls and asks would I like to be put on-call for the day.  I usually ask if they will just cancel me, they say no and then I say ok o being on-call.  Usually I then go right back to bed and sleep for a few  more hours, then spend the rest of my day watching some good tv.  However, today did not happen that way.  Everything was just as it should be up until the going back to bed part.  Seeing as how we have to be out of this townhouse by Sunday and nothing is packed I couldn't justify going back to bed.  Actually on the way back to the bed I caught a glimpse of the empty packing boxes and guilt filled my brain.   Now it is 7:50a.m and I still haven't packed anything.  I ate breakfast, checked the email, surfered around for awhile and now am rambling.  Why is it that packing up all of your belongings is so crappy?  Unpacking...not so bad.  Packing....freaking sucks! But I will pack, and then if I don't get called in to the hospital I will take a load of clothes (currently thrown into garbage bags) over to the new house.  And when I get to the new house I will put a second coat of paint on the trim in the guest room.  After the last coat of paint, I just have to clean up that room and then we are ready to move in!  You would think that the excitement of moving in would jump start some energy inside me and catapult me upstairs and start packing.  NOPE.  I have energy to do a lot of things right now, but packing up our shit is not on the list.  Not even on the bottom of the list.

      I recently became a new homeowner.  Thats right, at that age of 23 I have quickly found myself married and owning a home and with an actual career.  Its quite scary.  Much scarier that I imagined it would be.   I was a tad frightened when I graduated last year with an applied science degree and entered the work force as an RN.  I got married to my boyfriend of 6 years, and this wasn't so scary.  But the first year of marriage and buying a house have been quite frightening.  I didn't think that at 23 I would feel so tied down.   So "stable" I guess you could call it.  I always pictured my early 20's as being carefree and trying out all sorts of new things...trying to find what I like the best.  But, here I am working at job that I need (which sometimes can make it difficult to figure out if its the job that I actually want) and fixing up a house that my husband and I will be living in for quite awhile.  Which means that we are in the Lansing area to stay, ugh! With all the ramblings of how I am scared of my "stable" life. One would assume that I am all around unhappy. However its quite the contrary.   I do find myself sometimes wondering if I am in the spot that I am meant to be in, or the one that I am to stay in.  But I am happy...for now.  I do see some changes happening on the job front.  Not in the immediate future, but not so far off that I haven't already started the planning.

      my goal is to use the treadmill 4-5 times a week.  about 5-6 miles (on an incline).  i know that this isn't a very high goal.  but for someone who hasn't worked out in a while this is pretty decent.   i will keep track and everything.

      i'm going to be the camp nurse at church camp this year.  i'm actually really very nervous about it.  but excited at the same time.  i'm hoping to find a home parish in lansing soon.  it will be really good for my marriage.  and lord knows (and he really really does) that our marriage needs some serious help right now.  how fun to go back to camp.  i spent a lot of my youth there.  it is really my only vacation this summer too.  so i am going to make the most of it.

      I didn't go as short as I had anticipated.  I'm the type who really listens to the stylist.  I said I'd like to go a little shorter, but that she could just do her thing.  So she did.  Its way blonder than I had wanted, but I like it.  Its just hair, right?   Todays my birthday.  I've talked (or heard from) to all my favorite people already today....mom/dad, jason, jenna, melissa and mike.  yahoo! I started to put together my new treadmill today.  After I finally got the box open the instructions said "don't put this together by yourself!"  So I stopped.  Jason is giving my lots of flack for getting it.  He says that all women who have treadmills just let them collect dust.  I would use it, if I could get it put together.   I also got new bedroom furniture.  I'm really really excited about this.  I don't really love my house and it doesn't seem like that is something that I can fix.  So I am going to fill it with things I love.  The new furniture is suppose to get here the second week in May.  The set is with a queen size bed.  So I need to hurry up and get a queen size mattress.  I am taking my time with the decision, I'm hoping to get a mattress that will help rid me of my insomnia problem.  We'll see!

      Long or short hair?  I am switching to a new hair stylist today.  I'm a little nervous.  I am very attached to my orginal hair person and I'm sure that the next time I can drive the 2 hours to see her I will.  But today...someone new.  I am getting my hair cut and colored.  I'm thinking something a little shorter and sassy.  We'll see.  Hopefully it will be fun.

      AHHHHH!  Insomnia.  Not really the best problem to have.  I suppose that if I was super productive and got out of bed when I can't sleep and got stuff done it wouldn't be such a bad problem.  But I'm not that motivated.  I simply lay in bed wishing that I was asleep.  Laying there thinking about how tired I'm going to be at 5am this morning at work. You know what else is sucky....one of my greatest friends and support systems is moving away.  Far away.  I'm afraid that losing contact is what is going to happen.  I'm excited for him and his great oportunity (if he decides to make the best of it), but sad for our friendship.

      does having your period seriously have to be so painful.  i mean really...like gushing blood isn't gross enough, but does it have to feel like someone is inside you squeezing the shit out of your uterus.  i'm thinking "NO".

      it is fabulous to actually have that great friend that after hearing the familiar voice you immediately feel better.  i had a really crappy afternoon (hence my last entry) and an okay evening despite feeling absolutley betrayed by a friend.  easter is almost here and i have to work the weekend.  so my husband and i dyed easter eggs tonight and ate a baked ham (yes i actually baked a ham...my family traditionally always has ham on easter).  but after my husband went back to bed i was back into the ugly crying and feeling really bad about myself.  i called a friend to chat for just a second.  yes the purpose was partly to vent but really was because i knew that i would feel better after the conversation.  i do.  THANK YOU!

      i cried today like i haven't cried in a really long time.  the type of crying where you can't hold yourself up and your face is contorted into the ugliest face possible.  and the noise...it is unimaginable. the crying... 1.  for the dissapointment in someone i thought was a true friend 2.  for the rumor that was spread 3.  for people beleiving it and hence beleiving that i'm capable of cheating on my husband with not only a married man but a co-worker. 4.  for the loss of a true friend (not the above mentioned from number 1 but the married man from number 3).  He is exactly what i would call a true friend.  and soon he is leaving for another state so that he and his wife can start fresh at their marriage.  and i do wish the only the best for them.  but being a little selfish...i am going to miss him and the friendship terribly. 5.  just to simply cry.  i have been dealing with a bit of an insomnia problem lately and in utter exhaustion the crying felt good.   have i mentioned that i hate lansing, mi?  well i do.  and just as i was starting to like my job, someone there has completley ruined that for me.  i will walk into work and feel like people are looking at me and believing the rumor...i cheated.  what a stupid and haneous rumor.  and aren't we suppose to be professionals and not high schoolers?  i work in a critical care unit for god sakes.  what the fuck are we doing worrying about who is hooking up with whom and what caused someone to quit, and why the demise of so-and-so's marriage.  its silly and petty and unfortunately i care what people think of me.  and i am soooooo very dissapointed in the person who had balls to actually say out loud "we decided by process of elimination that M is leaving because he cheated on his wife and we decided that it was with sarah"  that is ludacrious.  and she should even be considered in the same category as true professional women.  even is she really did believe this to be true (how could you call yourself my friend and beleive it, but whatever) why would you sit around and talk about it at work like it won't affect others lives?  asanine.

      Wow...It has been a very very very long time since I've posted anything.  Quite a bit has happened. 1.  We moved into our first home. 2.  I switched to working the night shift (7pm-7:30am) 3.  My husband spent 3.5 months working out of town in Alabama. 4.  We've discovered the true meaning of "the first year of marriage is the hardest. 5.  I've applied to Baker College and will start working on my Bachelors in Health Administration Mgmt in June.  Gosh.  While the list isn't very long, it really feels long. No kidding about the marriage thing.  I sometimes wonder how young married couples make it to their third or fourth year.  We don't have any kids and both still under 25.  It is very tough.  It isn't only hard to simply just share your life with another person day in and day out.  But it is really tough to feel secure that the decision you made to say "I do" at the age of 22 is the right decision for the next 80 years of your life.  I feel pretty secure that the grass isn't greener on the other side, so to speak, but I do wonder if this marriage is the right place for me to be for the rest of my life.  AHHHHHH...does everyone feel this way when they are young and married?  With all these doubts people would probably wonder if I was married to a horrible guy?  I'm not.  I have my list of grumbles about him (and i'm sure he with me), but he loves me unconditionally.  I like to attribute most of our marital woes, to our young age and inexperience.  I guess time will tell me if my situation should change. On going back to school...I am excited.  I only work three nights a week.  So I have a lot of down time.  It is sort of strange to feel excited about studying.  But I really need to do something productive with my free time.  Lets not forget that finishing up this bachelros in Health Mgmt will help to get me out of the hospital and staff nursing.  I do love my job (most of the time) but I also know that I can't do it for the rest of my life.

      Peggy's wedding is done.  I had a great time.  It was really fun to spend time with her (and brent).  and to spend some time with Tammy.  She is great.  We do have a lot in common and probably would be great friends if we had any of the same free time to spend together.  who knows. work was crazy this week.  good and bad.  got to see anne.  CONGRATULATIONS!  I can't believe that she is getting married.  That's crazy.  i'm happy for her.  she is really excited.   Summer is almost here.  almost time for church camp.  i'm really getting excited about it.  my dad and jenna will be there.  yahoo.  hopefully all goes well.  i have another meeting this saturday about it.   jenna is coming to town tomorrow night.  that will be fun!  hopefully we can see some silly chick flick. then...the furniture gets here.  i can't beleive that i am going to have grown up bedroom furniture.  i might feel like i am living in a house and not a dorm room.  we'll see. lots of stuff to do.

      Peggy's wedding is only two days away.  I can't believe it.  I am very incredibly happy for her...Brent and her are very very happy.  It is just strange to think that about 1.5 years ago she was going to be my sister-in-law.  Meaning that yes she was going to marry my brother-in-law.  But nope.  I'm just as happy for her now.  Jason is freaked out about going to the wedding though.  Hopefully he will be corgial to her.  I will flip out if he isn't.  When I called Peggy today to check on her she was at the hospital with her grandpa, looks like he isn't doing well and will be spending the next few days in the hospital.  Poor Peggy, I hope that her wedding weekend will go well, she definetley deserves it.  Horoscopes are funny.  I go through cycles with reading them.  I sometimes find myself checking them all the time, and I kind of geek myself into believing them.  They are sometimes hard to ignore, especially when they seem very very accurate.  A friend of mine called today and told me to check his out... this is his for the 8th ..."Wait until the weekend is over to make a final decision that involves the making or breaking of a long-term situation. You may not have all the answers yet, and you really are in a rather impulsive mood, aren't you?"...    here is mine for the 8th ..."A call from a faraway loved one will arrive -- and just in the nick of time, too. Don't forget how close you were, and still are. Time and miles don't matter. The connection will always remain."    I'm just guessing that maybe I will hear from a long lost friend on Saturday?  Or I will hear a message seeing as how I am a bridesmaid in Peggy's wedding on saturday and I'm sure that I won't have my big man'phone on me.  One of his later ones also says..."The good news is that someone charming, spontaneous and absolutely delightful will be the cause of all the ruckus."  I can think of someone who is "charming, spontaneous, and delightful"!  Can't you?  hehe

I am going to a new tanning place now.  new bulbs...ouch! ordered some cute new sandals from JCrew, they are pink and have little bees on them.  i am also finally ordering my purse from dooney & bourke!  really excited about that.  i'm thinking that the shopping is whats keeping me happy.  isn't that ridiculous.  i'm not sure what type of void it is filling, but it works.

      isn't it so very sad when you lose a friend.  i didn't think that that was really going to happen.  but it seems as though it has.  we said "good bye" but not really as if we believed that the friendship would be over.   i feel in a way like i've been deceived a littled or made an ass of in a way.  i don't know.  its a funny feeling.  i guess i just feel sort of 'uneasy' about the whole thing.  and i simply miss the chats and the general support.  it was a friendship that no matter what was going on in each others lives, there was always time for support and encouragement.  on a whole different note.  i am so thankful to have the next 6 nights off.  i am exhausted with work lately.  and i really don't want anything to do with it for awhile.  another note again...a friend ended up in the hospital yesterday.  had to pull over on the highway cause he was dizzy and starting to pass out.  called 911 and sat in Charlotte's ER for a long time.  the dizzy thing has been happening for a while.  I'm a little nervous for him.   hope he is okay.  i will check on him later tonight.  i wonder if my sister is preggers yet?

      So very tired.  Work has been nutty.  I feel like I work on a psych unit lately.  And its not only the patients...but the people I work with too.  Can everybody realize that we are working through a nursing shortage.  Just because I am the "contact" nurse for the night doesn't mean that I am responsible for the shortage.   This is an interesting month for me.  I should be registering for classes, but haven't heard from Baker about how many of my credits are transferring, we have to make three big car payments, I am in a wedding, am sort of looking for a new (or another) job, and our new bedroom furniture gets here soon.  YEAH! Exercising is going great!  Yahoo for my new treadmill. Oh yeah... my diamond earrings are ready for pick up tomorrow!  I love them and can't wait to wear them!

      life seems tough lately.  love working out, after i actually get started.  but it is still tough to get my butt started. horrible loss of a patient.  glad i went to the funeral.  really really really nasty weather.  very frustrated with the house, and the water in the basement. furniture is on the way, maybe that will help with the house frustration.  we'll see.

      its been awhile.  the computers been down, and it has been out-smarting me, at least as far as getting back on-line. i'm going to be a mom!  some days i can't believe it...it is mostly the days when i picture myself with a huge pregnant belly.  but i'm excited.  i have a friend here in yucky lansing, that is very schooled in the way of birthing.  she currently works at a birth center nearby and is going to be jason and my doula for the birth.  "doula" being our birth educator before the baby is here and the link between us and the nurses during the labor.  i think it will help to keep me calm, and hopefully help to keep me away from the drugs and focused during labor.  we'll see. work is crazy.  it is tough for me to do 3 shifts in a row every week.  i am hoping to get back on the day shift by the end of the summer.  it is just too tough for me to keep flipping back and forth between nights and days.  hopefully being on the day shift will help. the dress store in Michigan City, IN (where the bridesmaid dresses for Kimbers wedding were ordered) agreed to simply order me a bigger, and i do mean bigger, dress.  I am just hoping to have it altered to not only fit well but to be cute on me.  we'll see.
