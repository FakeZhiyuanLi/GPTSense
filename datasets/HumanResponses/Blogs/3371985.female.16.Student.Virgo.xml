         The other day i watched   Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban™   ..alone.. But it was way astig!!! sobrang cool! Pero iba yung ending. It's not like what was written in the book. But anyways the SFX were cool! Then yesterday i watched   The Chronicles of Riddick™   *waaahhh* VIin Diesel's soo sexy!!!! But i didn't get to finish the film. Kasi po i was looking for someone to come with yesterday kaso di pwede si Rosa Isabel. Shermie wasn't replying. But in the middle of the movie my phone beeped. Twas Shermie! She said sorry coz she left her phone at home and she was at her mom's office. She asked kung pwedeng syang humabol and she did. So i didnt get to finish the film. But twas ayz. Its better naman to be with friends e.. besides the man beside me was creeping me out. Parang may gagawin kakaiba. Natraumatize na ko a ganyan e! Before i watched Mulan with my mom and bro. I was seated at the seat near the aisle. Then i man stood beside me, first i wasn't bothered then napansin ko may hawak sya!     OH MY GAWD THE MAN WAS MASTURBATING BESIDE ME!!!!!    *waaaahhhh* We invited Chantel to come to SM but took back her answer. Apparantly her friend has a gig on Megamall and she's going there. Nagtampo ko syempre. It's been such a long time na huli namin nakasama si Chantel. But then again she has her own life. So i leave you guys with a copy of me and Shermie's pictures at SM. ciao! ü

           here's a copy of my old posts..   sO uHhMmM..aS of nOw tHiRd aNd fIrSt bOyFrIeNdS aRe MaKiN tHeiR mOvEs..iNvoLvInG gEtTiN bAcK tOgEtHeR..dUnNo wHo To cHoOsE nOr iF eVeR iM gOiN tO cHoOsE aNy oF tHe tWo. tHe fIrSt bOyFrIeNd,wEvE gOtTeN bAcK tOgEtHeR tWiCe aNd ThE tHiRd i tHiNk tHiS iS tHe fOuRtH tImE..hMmMm..vErY cOnFuSeD..  --------------------------------------  hurtin when i shouldn't be..  3rd x said he'd stay away coz i told him so..he didnt want to but he knows he's hurtin me..he has a girl in his life now..and said we were both important..that's why i told him i should stay away..for the girl's sake..he said he didnt want to..and now he agreed it sucks bigtime coz it's really hurtin me..i shouldn't be feelin this coz im the one who said we should part ways..but why am crying and why am i hurting..?  --------------------------------------  nEw GuY nEw LoVe..?!  new guy new love? waddya think..? he's nice..he can take my attitude..unlike some people out there! (stupid motherfuckers!) he wants me to go meet him..but i dont like the idea..i dont like age gaps either..he's 4 years older than me..i dont like age gaps..they have that maturity that i cannot still compensate with..but he knows how to go with my flow..he doesnt stray..i like talking to him..i keep on charging the cordless phone so i could talk to him at night coz he's got a job..BUT STILL I DONT LIKE THE AGE GAP! i text him every now and then.i misscall him all the time. wonders bout what he's doin'.gets mad at him when he doesnt reply. he says sorry when he doesnt. he acts like a child when he talks to me..immitates that of a baby i suppose..SO WADDYA THINK?! this new LOVE or just a gush of emotions..?  --------------------------------------  dilemma  currently facing a dilemma..the guy before was not in like with me but with someone else.actually he said he likes me but the one he likes aside from me came in the picture first so he likes her more than me.normally that would've been ego shattering in some way coz the reason was so "mababaw"?,but i couldn't care less now.he calls me at around 11 at night, just last night he did,just to tell me that he and the girl went out yesterday and the girl asked him to buy her something coz it was her birthday.of course he obliged.but after that the girl was giving him "alibys"(is this correct?!) like she can't talk to him yesterday coz her mom got mad at her for not coming home early and today she has some "interview" "workshop" or whatever that is,and she can't talk to him coz she won't be at home.he was restless.didn't know what to think,and i out of the goodness of my heart(yeah right),gave him advices.i didn't get irritated with ayt?i don't like him that much pa naman kasi.simple "like" lang.what irritated me was that he couldn't make up his mind! if he thinks the girl's just playin with him it would be better if he forgot her move on! ang kulit kasi nya! nakakaasar yung katatanung nya kung anung gagawin nya! in the first place kita naman nya yung ugali nung girl e! hingan ka ba naman ng load e di naman kayo magkakilala? DUH!?!? tas ngayon di sya mapakale kasi nakakapanghinayang daw. sobrang badtrip kasi katangahan nya yon! ako naman tanga din kasi kinausap ko pa! but that's not my actual dilemma.gusto ko lang magkwento.hahaha my real dilemma is that i like this guy,he says he loves me,but i think other wise..he hasn't seen me yet. ang lamang ko sa kanya is that i saw his picture na.kaya when i say i like him at least there's some truth in that diba?he's a known karirista...sinabi nya sakin lahat ng naging x nya,and some of them i've seen na..others i know..kaya nagdadalawang isip ako kasi lahat ng x nya sexy,maganda..yun bang pwedeng "irampa"? paginentertain ko yung feelings nya pareho lang kaming masasaktan.kasi gusto na nyang tumino e what if daw ako yun pinadala na magpapatino sa kanya.kaso yun nga di pa nya ko nakikita..what if magkita kami di nya ko gusto..e di umasa din ako..mas masasaktan ako kasi di naman ako yung mangiiwan..sya..diba?kaya nalilito ko..i like him..and im starting to fall..but as much as possible i wanna supress the feeling..i just want to avoid being hurt..i know that sureal..pero kahit na..sino ba namang tanga ang gustong masaktan?i like him..i like him..and i think its better if i just don't tell him..  ----------------------------------  it's getting harder.. (no!not what's in between his legs!T_T)  He hates me! (well,i THINK he hates me..) he saw me post something at the chatroom and he thinks im like that.. said he thought that i was different..well I AM! i just place that so peepz would pay attention to my message (hekz!) and some did pay attention and let's just i didn't expect him to see that AND ACTUALLY GIVE A REACTION!!! he was pissed of! he hated me! He said i made him feel bad..and i was so sorry for that..i didnt mean to give him that impression..im not like that..i believe in KARMA! ayoko ng maulit yung nangyari sa kin dati noh!T_T asar talaga! di ko alam kung bakit hinahabol ko pa sya! dapat nga lumalayo ako kasi di kami bagay! sa harap ng ibang tao ang kalalabasan non is makapal ang mukha ko! im worried bout his reputation..not myself..but him..martir noh?pero yoko naman kasi umasa e..ako din kawawa..diba?    they may be senseless to you but to those who "know" the real me they know my posts aren't senseless they know what hardships in love i've gone through..next time maybe i'll tell ya'll bout it. i don't need simpathy..i just want to let it all out.

         Since my mom bought that   Canon IXUS™II Digicam   my addiction to taking moi's pictures became more intense. hehe. =þ since i got back my Nokia3650 i became obssesed with taking my pictures and now that i got hold of a digicam (something that can take more clearer, more astig pictures) i got more addicted! haha. call it vanity if you wish but i don't care this is my life. Besides i know some of you out there at  urlLink Friendster™  stares at my pictures! And i know some of you even print them! Haayy.. Obssesed people..oi nakakatakot yan noh! Parang stalker! *waaahhh* Anyways forget about my "kakapalan ng mukha" i was supposed to write something sensible here.  Ah..yes.. The other day i was goin home i rode a jeepney who's driver i suppose is 46+ years old,and i couldn't stop feeling sorry for him coz im the only passenger..ang hirap mag"hakot" ng pasahero noh. And i can see that he's really tired. That's when i began to think about "salary/wage" (whatever is the difference..i know there'e a difference coz it was discussed in Eco class..but i just forgot..).    WHY IS IT THAT THOSE WHO WORK SO HARD GET PAID SO LOW, WHILE THOSE WHO JUST SIT AROUND IN THE OFFICE AND BOSS OTHER PEOPLE AROUND GET'S MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE?!?    Why is this world so unfair? i know i dream of being rich and bossing people 'roud and all that..but still why is this world so unfair?  Haayy...this sucks..im out..comments are so much welcomed..

         Was with    urlLink Rosel    and   Jeff *  yesterday. My feet are still aching due to that loooonngg walkin   Recto    I never knew lookin for f*uckin second hand books sucks,  BUT  entertaining ! It's like you give them the title of the book you're lookin for, they look at it closely, you feel that they have the book and the agony of walking again is about to end, BUT NO! They'll just give it back and say that they don't have it! gggrrrr! It's also entertaining coz i kept on wondering (and i still am) how they know they don't have that book when they don't even scan what they have! Did they memorize all the titles of what thet were selling?!?  Whatever...  Anyways i should start on as to how me and Rosel met up.  We were talking on the phone then she said she's going to Quiapo and me the ever kitikite would like to go out and asked if i could come. And we decided to meet up!  I was already at Quiapo at around 1:30 pm. I have no idea how to contact her coz of her newly-bought-but-already-sira cellphone. Pare wala syang signal! So i was wandering around Quiapo for 30 minutes! May lumalapit na sakin "Ate bili kang sampaguita?" haayy... as much as i wanted to buy from that lil kid i couldn't all i had was   P40!   How the hell was i suppose to buy from her kung pamasahe ko pa lang kulang na?!?!?  Good thing i brought my Nokia 3210™. I had no guts to bring out my Nokia3650™ (AND I HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF DOING THAT!) kahit na nga 3210 na lang ginagamit ko pumapasok pa rin ako dun sa loob nung "mall" nakakatakot no! Parang andaming mandurukot! I kept on calling   Raymond *  asking what time she went out, what she was wearing etc. Buti na lang may load din yung Smart™ sim ko anak ng putakte. FINALLY!!!! i contacted her! She asked me to wait at the Mercury Drugstore there.     AND LOOK WHAT ENTERTAINED ME WHILE WAITING!!!!    Maid in Manhattans having an EB! I can't picture the look on the girl's face. Either she's just   shy   or   nadidismaya   sya. (i am guessing its the   later  . hehe =þ) The guy looked like a   kargador   at greenhills. (im soooo sorry for being a laitera,its just part of what i really am..)  Anyways they decided to leave just in time, Rosa Isabel came!  (Haaayy..sa wakas..)  HaHaHa  We went to   TUP   to look for her mom. Kukunin kasi namin yung perang pambili ng libro nya. E paalis yung mama nya,so we went to SM Manila muna.   (im tired and im not in the mood to tell what happened..maybe next time..or look at Rosel's blog if she wrote it there na.)  Basta pinuntahan kami ni Jeff dun sa 7-11 sa Morayta. Nakita kami. Umuwi na ko.  OK  On the ride home may nakasabay akong mga jologs.    WHY JOLOGS?!?    I know..I know masamng manglait..pero totoo naman e.  There were 8 of them. 6 guys 2 girls.  Nakakairita sila.  Let's start with the two girls:  One looked really trying hard to be pretty, but she isn't. She's just payat. Gawd!   WALA NGA SYANG @ NGIPIN SA HARAP E!   Nakakahiya! Ang daldal pa naman nya! She was arguing with her boyfriend. According to her may invisible barrie daw sa gitna nila. WHATEVER!  The other girl was malandi. She was hitting on the guy,who looked 25+ years old (i suppose they're 17-19 years of age.),beside her. She wasn't doing a very good job.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY HAD TO BRING A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER! (WALA BA SILANG PANYO?!?!)  ok dun naman tayo sa lalake.  Namention ko na yung 2  yung 4 pa..  i have nothing againts the two guys at my right side.they were tahimik.  PERO YUNG NASA KALIWA KO ANG EPAL!  Trying-hard Wannabe-Rappers! (oohhh..Jam* Hates guys like these! haha =þ)  What's more irritating is that may sumakay sa 2 matanda..An old lady sat between the two girls. Still nagaaway pa din si feeling-pretty girl and her gwapo-wannabe boyfriend. Finuck-you yung girl nung guy, and of course magrereact sya    KNOW WHAT THE REACTION WAS?!?      "TANGINA WAG M KONG GANYANIN HA!"    Sobrang nakakahiya sila..haayyy..ako yung nahihiya para sa kanila e..T_T    NIKEI's MOOD FOR THIS DAY:  HAPPY!  kase..basta! hahaha    *: Jeff=Rosel's boyfriend Raymond=Rose's bro Jam=Jrock from friendster!ü

         Due to very very heart breaking circumstances i deleted my other blog   Nikei..ü  .   Still recovering from what happened. Only one person know's what's really happening now,my bestfriend    urlLink Rosel   ,i trust you so please don't blurt out my reckless actions.   Much thank you's to   Kuya Mico(Consing)  , a new found friend and latest "kuya" from  urlLink  Friendster™  , for giving me good advices, for speaking his mind, of course being "there".   Currently amusing myself with  urlLink  Pinoyster™   and   mIRC  .   Pero badtrip. Because of another channel i got banned from   #LinkTV  . Sobrang badtrip noh! Wala naman akong ginagawa naban pa ko! Aaaarrgggghhh!!!      IM AM SO PISSED OFF!
