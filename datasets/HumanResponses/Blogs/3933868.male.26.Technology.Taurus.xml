						   1320...   Yesterday ,i heard the bad news  the other plant is being attack by local people, hmm,,, yeah that the risk when u work in place like this...   They was about 30-50 man with a blade, knife, machete, and the most dangerous stuff.. "cigarette" ...hell, they were blocking the way and togather they through the fence into the CCR (central Control Room).   our man in that place is try using persuasive approach, but i doesnt look very good,because &nbsp;that native just want do as they want, no negotiation.   After hard and long talkin, they will move their man to the entry gate and camp in there, our man is little comfort with it.we dont afraid to a blade, knife and all those things, but one we afraid is all tht man is bring a cigarette and smoking near the plant.   Well if there is a leaking...hell...we will lost that site. All will be burn down to ash, including the pipe line to nearest station.  in fact: ... there will be a doomsday in that area....   Well, the condition now is under control, after our company hire a groups of Indonesian Arm Force, to secure the area....  and did u have any idea why the angry native came to our place?..they just want to work in here...   They think a large kind of building will be require a lots of man....they think this place is a factory like....but in fact...we just need 10 man to runs this plant operational...no need much man....   I am so glad when hear a condition is under control, because usually i based in there, Supporting all that communication and computer stuff in there, that plant is a most beautiful plant, well because she is build in a valley,and surround by a tinny hills, so in the morning about 5-7 AM,..you can see a mist around you, and you can see a rainbow every rainny morning around that plant....   i call that place " The Place beyond the cloud"...or "some whre over the rainbow"....
