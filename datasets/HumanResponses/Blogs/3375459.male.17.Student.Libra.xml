      Just came out from the shower, boy do I smell good. "The Mummy Returns" Great movie back in 2001, still great today.   (flash back) Still remember that its was the first late night movie I ever went in Singapore with all the other red cross members, but before that, we had dinner at Mount Faber. Such a romantic place, but it was ruined with us around. HEhhee... Kids playing with sparker in the dark, and couple cuddle up together. Amazing how I could still remember.   Alright~ After dinner, we hopped back on to our rented bus and made our way down to Suntech City. It was late man, first time I saw so many shops close in there. Don't think I need to go into details for the movie, so it was back to camp after the movie.  (Present) I would like to go for another late night movie man. HAhaha...

      HEHehheee...... Planned to sleep all the way till later this morning, but i guess i'm just not use to it. Waking up in this hour, weird. Lets see what did i missed out at work, stuff at the 2nd story is cool man, ploycarbon car body add-ons. Then there was this uncle who came along, wanting use to polish the cars, he said "not that i want you to work, but in fact we're teaching you all a skill" *sneeze* sure is cold right now. Anyway, we continue back down to the 1st storey, the reception room where we place our bags in. We were to ask to check scale models of cars (already built), NIceee~ HEhheeee do them sell them there? Hopefully after blogging this i can at least get some thoughts out of my head, should be empty enough to have a good night's rest. I think I Should go for another try to enter dream land... Everybody, have a good night's rest! =)

      After finishing hell, we got another set to check under floor 1 section A. This is where I kena sabotage, received shower of blessing for up above. Got my back all wet, I want revenge. Tara! You were lucky, I weren't carrying a bottle of water with me, when I was above you. I guess if you do more of what you did with your sister on that poor chair today, maybe the bees will stop coming. Hmmmm..... I guess everybody did their part, cause we got our job done much much earlier then last year. Ohya, my nails grew longer after peeling those stickers from the boxes, especially the white ones (seems like only the bss boys were doing it). Yada Yada Blah Blah Blah... Mess all cleared up.. Time to line up and get paid! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip HURRAY!! I hid myself away behind two big guards, but still I couldn't smoke away. Was caught by Tara and how can I resist that smile, aRRhhh... There you go, your commission.  Took a bus home, blog, showered, dinner, fruits (durian), blog and I think I should go and have some rest now. Great Day!

      Payday sure is good! Got to work in the 2nd and 4th storey, it was cool man. HAha, really~ with the air conditioning, how can took five right after that. Then it was back to work. Darn! Desmond and I got to check the second floor again. It was terrible I tell you,  knock  my forehead once into a beam while reading out the part number to Desmond and walking. And  AGAIN , the back of my head while I backtrack. If u think it ends here, you are so damn wrong.  Hit  the back of my neck into another beam as I tried to get to the very top by stepping on the shelves. Amos had to irritate me and made me  ram  my spine right into what seems to be a car door which was sticking out. Lucky for me to have survive hell (second floor) and walk away scratchless with no signs of concussion.   errrmmmm... Hungry sia... Will continue to blog later...  B e  R ight  B ack

      Now, u dun see me waking up this early Everyday. Suddenly, waking up early seems like my very first time. It's cool, nice gently lit skies and birds chirping. So many things I never take the time to notice before. I want to sleep for a few more minutes, but I can't seem to fall asleep. The sun's still rising, I'm still aching from yesterday, but like what people say, "no pain, no gain" & "shuo ting, kuo ting (if you stop working, you stop the feeding too)".  AHhhh! Its another day of work, another day filled in advance. Hopefully everyone does their job and we can wrap things up and get paid earlier. Heheheheeee..... Could we skip the commission thingy? For now, it feels good to work once in while, keeps me thinking "I should enjoy my holidays even more now that I've got lots of them". Ah, I'm going to have my breakfast. Chiao!

      Just came back from work, boy am I thirsty. Just a second...  Ok, Back! Woh... Today was fast, or it feels rather fast to me. This was the very First time I finished checking and waited for the rest to complete theirs. Feels damn great man! Most of all I didn't have to check the second floor, it feels so good standing up right on the flat solid floor to work. I haven done this much walking in weeks, seriously, I won't go walk in and out & around my house right?  So, we're suppose to be at Ubi at 1:30pm, but we turn up early and so CoFFee BrEaK!! Turns out somebody given us a cushion timing , right? Turn up at the work place at 1:50+, and we were the first group to be there. So there was the briefing and it was off to work. The way Desmond and I worked was kinda interesting, we can just switch our post anytime. High shelf where he couldn't reach, low shelf and tight spot I couldn't go, we would switch our post. So half the time I was a counter and the other half a recorder. Pick up a little trick of the trade form him, still I'm loss at some points.  WORK WORK WORK!!  5pm DINNER TIME!!!   Wahliao I just came out of the toilet after washing my hands, and caught looking retard while calling Amos to meet up. AARrgghhh... Forget it, hao nan bu gen nu do√º, i can't win anyway (nice shirt [the jersey that you were talking about?] with your nick written on it). Even having dinner with the boys was such a mess. Next time, someone has got to take down the cash transaction down, dividing the change was such a hassle. Ok, dinner's done! BAck to work.. Desmond and I did another 3 more sets, and we're done. That's not the case for Amos & Kah Loong, seems like pairing them up was a big mistake. Amos was new and Kah Loong only had working experience of just once before (me too). So they end up with bad communication and thus that slows them down. 3 sets for the whole of today, if I remember correctly. As I took a walk home cutting through the market, notice I haven been down for too long and some of the stalls has already stop opening due to the up coming upgrading. Ok, Gotta go shower now. Nitex everyone~!

      Oh yah. Who says drawing is a boring routine? I get to do what I like, I'm happy with it. But I've got to stop the cards this 2 days because of work (Though I said i'm lazy to work, but its time I got out of my house le, so happy). I think by the day after tomorrow I'll be refresh and ready to start on the next card. =) here's the cards I did yesterday, more coming right up~ (Hopefully you guys will be able to view it, cause i've uploaded them to www.ripway.com this time round)   urlLink The Big   urlLink The Change   urlLink The Loop   urlLink The Maze   urlLink The Dash   (new)   urlLink The Jump   (new)   urlLink The Shadow   (new)   urlLink The Wave   (new)

      Its a bright sunny day, and my grades are out! Not the greatest grades I will say, but its just about as must effort as I had put in. Can't blame anyone else, except of this stupid group work that I done all of the work mostly by myself. Grades for that went downhill cause of the lack of knowlage of what's going on in the project by the rest of the members. Aiya... Let bygone be bygones.. Hehee... Here's my grades  Tan De Yang  DIPLOMA IN ARCHITECTURE STAGE 1B FULL-TIME    Your module grades are as follows:  Module Code Module Name Grade  BE1000 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STUDIO I B  BE1001 THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE I C  BE1002 BUILDING TECHNOLOGY I B  BE1003 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE I B  BE1004 COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN & PRESENTATION DIST  LC0018 COMMUNICATION SKILLS I B  SP0101 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT C   I'm cussed with Bs. Darn!!! Must put in more effort this year, I know I can do it. Got to keep pushing myself, can't be lazy no more! Its a BRIGHT DAY ahead!! And I'm go to work later on thanks to tara's daddy and of cause her . If not I won't even have a job. She wasn't there the last time I work, so I've got no idea how the commission ceremony works. Heheee... I'll see it tomorrow after I get my pay. Should I go thinking about the amount to be giving now? Nah~ Gotta think happy and work, if not I won't even get paid. kiraku signing out..................

      Feeling gloomy, must be the doing of the weather. Its looking a little too dark outside at this hour. Well then, everyday is a routine. I woke up brush my teeth, had breakfast and started on the cards again. I've done 3 more and another one is still on its way, I'll have the links to them up here later on..   Why did I stop at the third drawing, cause my neighbor's baby ran into my house to escape form her Mum. She a sneaky little one, grabbing the chance to come into my house as my Mum went out with incent sticks or some would prefer calling joss stick to pray to the sky. I had to close the door of the room where the cards are, don't want another incident whereby the cards got stepped on and crushed like what my niece did, now would I? Hahaa... Had to open my arms wide open to stop her running around and slowly corner her back out the main door. Did I mention she was an Indian? Guess that does't matter anyway. Alright I'm as stuff as an over Size elephant plush toy after dinner. Think I've rested enough, Back to Work!

      I'm not always a listener, I do want to speak up sometimes and ask questions, lots of them. Once I've got too much crap I couldn't bear, I would be a nag and irritate anyone. I do mean anyone, so I'm apologizing to anyone i've even irritated.  So many thoughts going through me, some i can't type here. What am i going to do? I don't know. Guess I'll just have to forget everything and reset my brain. Its no problem right? I've done that before, i can do it again. Once again, I'm sorry to those who won't forgive me.  But forgeting isn't going to settle this matter right? Maybe i shall remember this time, maybe even viewing form a differen espect. I Don't Know what to do! ARRGGHHH!!!!! I really wish i could shout out loud, like i did when i was a kid in grandpa's  kampong . What this in my eyes, tears? I like to think of it as water of reflection. What do we ever get from crying? Sometimes it comfort, help or ever more scolding. But most of all, we cry for a reason and in that moment a tear forms, we give thoughts to that reason, we reflect. But I'm forcing it back, i don't want to cry, don't want to think anymore. I just want to get back to my happy go luck self.. this is all just crap.. the world is so wonderfully presented in front of us to explore and to experience. And the exsistance of my tiny little thoughts as compared to the world is holding me back from finding that presious someone. Or should i say driven them away.  AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! If you don't understand all those crap above, NVm then.. thats all i've to say

      I feel so bad to wrong a right. Sometimes i wonder too much, missleading myself. And i just can't forgive myself for that. I'm just a stupid, selfish guy who isn't fit to like anyone. Ok, thats all.... i should be getting back to my oldself right about now.   Two more day till the grades are out and work. OUh! so execited. I'm getting to partner Desmond again, xin ku ta le(poor him). Hopefully, he doesn't make any last minute changes. Still remember last year, i was being blame for getting to check the stuff on the second floor just because i'm tall and huge. Though the work is dusty(still ok with me), but i like the part where by after we finished our rounds, we can sit together in a huge gang to chat and wait 4 the next set of list to come. But this year, sad to say. Seem like alot of my frineds aren't coming, not all is lost. we can still have a small group chat among ourselves. Besides, we'll get to see girls. *nose bleeding* But before that, I must try to recall the sections. If not I'm going to get nags from Desmond again.  Sigh~  later!

Forgive me Tara, I'm no photocopying machine. If I were to continue at this rate.. i should be able to complete everything in 22days non-stop. 22days later, I ought to think about the packaging. Hmmm... got some wonderful idea, but its a suprise. You'll know then  Arh! It has been around 2 weeks, and my left wrist still hurts. Shit man, maybe i should just type with my rigth hand for the moment. If not i can't work on Friday. oki dok! wahahaha... i'm typing with rigth hand only, fell so slow. Alrigth, i know i'm already a slow typist, but this is just terrible! I can't discribe the pain in my left wrist, its like there but not there. Is it what the eldely call  Feng Shi ? I don't know.

      I'm Getting all DizzY again.. woh! I've finished 52 border lines of the clowcards, that would mean I can start drawing the original set of clowcards. I think I would pass the character and hope cards first, I've need some mode to start on those. If not the out come would be not up to my standard.   By the way, I've add a song to this blog. Its call  Tooi Kono Machi De (In This Distant Town)  by  Minaya Naomi , its form an OST (Original Sound Track) of an amime. Now which anime was it? hmmm... I'm not telling you. It's going to take quite a while to load (check the IE's status bar to see the loading), but i bet you'll love it as i did. Enjoy!  Here are the lyrics!

      Finger licking good.. HEHehee.. No, I‚Äôm not talking about KFC  DURIANS!! WAHahahaa‚Ä¶ has been so long since I last touched those moist, fragrant fleshy meats of the durian fruit. The taste of it is just simply, heavenly. HEhe‚Ä¶ I wonder why are there people out there that hates the smell of it.. ‚ÄúOne man‚Äôs trash, is another man‚Äôs treasure‚Äù? Oh no.. This is definitely a golden nugget. To those who hate the smell ‚ÄúTry it! You‚Äôre sure to find that same nugget of gold underneath the stinking soil‚Äù   Hmmm‚Ä¶ Before dinner today, I spent almost my whole afternoon watching animeS with my lao er there was  Chrno Crusade, Kenran Butoh Sai The Mars Daybrea and Bakuretsu Tenshi . It really was an amine marathon, episode after episode. It fells great man, I‚Äôve finally got to watch so many episode of chrno I had missed after it has been licensed.   Slack slack slack‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing.. it rotting at home.. Maybe someday I should get out and explore alone. Maybe not.. I like company a lot‚Ä¶ HEheee‚Ä¶ wonder who will be willing to lead me =P sigh~ I‚Äôm useless aren‚Äôt I? I‚Äôm going to be 18 soon and I still haven been to so many places in this small country Singapore. Some times I wonder, am I a little  Zhi Bi ? I stay home almost everyday during holidays, doing no more then eat, drink, sketch, sleep.. blah blah blah‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt even know what I want any more. Life has been so unclear. Am I going to live my dreams? I wonder.

      HELLO! ANYBODY OUT THERE? HEHEHE.. THIS IS FUN~!  All right guys.. This is my very 1st blog... so shall we start with my dream..? HEheee.. Sorry if that's going to bore you.. but I‚Äôve got nothing else to talk about, bear with me ok? Hhmmmm. Rarely have I got dreams that come day after day, or should I say 1day of nightmares and 2days of nice though weird dreams. The nightmare 2 nights ago was short, but it did its job.. It goes with me receiving an sms from the sister of a very important friend of mine saying‚Äùhoho‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it with you and her‚Äù.. Hey it was short, but it woke me up (checking my phone to see its for real) thank goodness.  Moving on to night 2, this one‚Äôs a little jumbled up. Firstly there‚Äôs this shared lunch in  Plazatech  (the whole place just looks like a combination of Plaza Singapura and Suntech City) got to tell u guys, that mall looks just so cool.. I‚Äôll be lucky if I can still remember it and hand it up as my project someday. Back to my dream1, Hehehe.. it was then followed by a movie date.. Got the tickets, sad to say, they were the last 2 and it‚Äôs separated by an occupied seat. ‚ÄúWHICH SICKO WOULD TAKE A SEAT INBETWEEN A DATING COUPLE?‚Äù Oh ya. The theater just looks so much like the LT5 in SRJC‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt ever remember the movie. Then it was the arcade which looks more like an amusement park with rollercoaster, ferris wheel, cotton candy machines‚Ä¶ and I had to wake up. Without walking her home!! Damn‚Ä¶.   What‚Äôs so cool was that I continued with that dream this early morning.. Walking her home in the night, a quick good night and I woke up naturally with a smile..  Basically of the rest of the day I slacked.. Tried this new  No Hiang  my mum made.. What‚Äôs new? Smile =) coz its cheese! But it the taste of cheese only comes at the very last moment before I swallowed it. Arh, then I got so crazy over the Blitz gundam. I tried to make a model of it out of card boards a broken gundam and super glue after dinner. The layer of super glue on the card gives a plastic finish. Cool Huh? And I manage to make the front ‚Äúskirt‚Äù of Blitz.. HEhehe okok.. I bored u guys out didn‚Äôt I? It‚Äôs getting late. Sweet Sweet Dreams to Everyone, NiteX ~_~‚Ä¶zzzZZ

      SOME IDIOT BY THE NAME  ABDU MALIQ  IS GIVING OUT MY HANDPHONE NUMBER TO HIS FRIENDS. I wouldn't be this pissed off if its only one of his friends who dialed the wrong number, but this very morning, I had got 5 Indian callers (males & females) with different numbers looking for the same guy ( ABDU MALIQ  was what they repeated when I replied that they had go the wrong number). Tell me what are the chances of 5 person dialing the wrong number, but looking for the same guy? As slim a chance as to finding out how big is the universe, right? This clearly means that IDIOT had really been giving out my number.

      Second day without any relapse, I guess I‚Äôm fine. But I‚Äôm still having a bit of sore throat & half running nose. My throat‚Äôs full of phlegm 'flam'. I wish I could just cough everything out. Things weren‚Äôt going too well for Lao Er as she had been having Diarrhea since yesterday night. She‚Äôs still not getting any better after taking the ‚Äò Charcoal ‚Äô tablets, she got from her visit to a polyclinic today. Hhmmmm‚Ä¶ Charcoal (carbon), I wonder what does it do?   Today was also the second last Saturday before school reopens. I‚Äôm feeling every more restless, I want to get out. Why do I have to be sick?   When on another printer hunt on the net since I really can‚Äôt do anything else. There was this Lexmark printer which caught my eyes with its lost cost, however the reviews on Cnet wasn‚Äôt too good (avenge rating of 6.5). It says there that it runs out of ink fast with ‚Äòso-so‚Äô quality.  Getting bored just looking at printers, I looked up something else on the net. ‚Äò Stikfas !‚Äô that‚Äôs right stikfas figurines. The guys who made them are guys so damn creative.  Visit  urlLink http://www.Stikfas.com/  for more information. ?Cool?Cute? Can‚Äôt decide which word to use to describe these ‚Äúfanta StiK ‚Äù figurines.   Getting drowsy so from my last cocktail of medicine, YES! No more yucky tasting cough syrup! Nitex nitex~

      I had a relapse of chilliness and fever this early morning at around 3am, reaching a scary 39¬∞C. What it this? It took me a full day to stabilize my body temperature, and I had a relapse. Mum had to stay up again, just to wipe my forehead with a wet towel. After about 20minutes, she went to bed thinking I was OK. But as soon as she left, I started heating up once more. The mattress was making things worse as it was trapping heat I generated. I didn‚Äôt want to wake Mum up again, so I pushed aside the mattress and slept on the floor itself. The floor took my excess body heat away, so cooling‚Ä¶ I fell asleep soon after, and woke up 7 hours later with a body temperature of 36.5¬∞C. Phewp~ at last, back to normal body temperature. Please, no more relapse‚Ä¶   Cough so much until sore throat, so I had no choice but to continue taking the cough syrup that taste so awful. I‚Äôm gonna rinse my mouth later. Can‚Äôt believe I used to like syrup medicine more then pills & tablet. But in any case, I rather live my life without them. I‚Äôm sure you agree with me, medicines are just so yucky. Everyone take care hor, especially with the haze around. I‚Äôm going to rinse my mouth and rest le‚Ä¶ TaTa everyone‚Ä¶

      I am sick!! or not... I don't know... It's not a flu or a cold... I'm nose is just so irritated by the haze and the fumes release from monster machines. I was sneezing so much I didn't want to do anything, including drawing. It felt so much like I've got water in my sinus. And now a running nose, guess I new a box of tissue next to me later when I sleep. If I know myself better, its going to take me quite a few days to get better. God I wish the monster crane would not be facing my flat during the next few days. * SNEEZE * SHIT MAN!! I've to wipe the monitor screen again. Ok, I guess I should do so now... BYeZ

      Oh my aching back! Even my right hand's knuckles are starting to swollen. But even so, I had a great day playing basketball with some old pals and the usual gang. I realized I had been slacking too much, and my footwork got all messed up. Even my aiming sucks, standing under the hoop doing the same action (catching the rebound and shooting) three times before I actually score a point. But something never change, I was still doing my ‚Äòbreak-dance‚Äô fall and recovery. I rather fall the correct way, then to balance myself and hurt my ankles again.   For the next five games, I got back my scoring feeling and footing. With a nice combination of players, and team work with Linus & Zeng Yuan, we won five games in a row in a 3 on 3(losers out) match. Now how sweet is that? But having played six games in a row to start off the day, I was all worn out. We took a rest and its back to the game again.  Then Tara showed up with her charming smile =), that made me walked away from the on going game (HAha.. that's not the real reason I walked out of the game lah). Passed her prize sketches to her, at the same time I got the One Piece figurines form her. Next, she passed me her donation card with her birthday pen (am I right?) asking me to donate. Running through my wallet, I only managed to find a two dollar note and a lot of coins. I‚Äôm so sorry to had only donated two dollars. You must be cursing me by now =x. And sorry again for not helping you ask the guys, but I don't think they will donate anyway. And another sorry for the ball that almost hit you. So having no more donors, she left to collect her passport. And the games went on.  It‚Äôs terrible I say. I got a karate chop from Kah Loong the ‚ÄòBack Belt‚Äô at my neck. Then there was a sandwich squeeze in between him and Liuns in mid air. Arrrhhh... My aching back. Next, I accidentally hit the ball into Amos's face and the rebound hit my finger tips head on, which should be the reason my knuckles are swollen now. Time passed by and all of us were too tired to carry on playing, so it‚Äôs off to the mee pok stall we used to go for lunch. Chitchat and gossip a little... and it was time to say bye bye.  After a nice shower back at home, I assembled the two figurines I got from Tara. This feels like when I‚Äôm much younger buying those $0.50 Doraemon box, $1.00 Tora box and $3.50 boxes of candy toy from econ mini mart. But I never did finish collecting the full set of $3.50 toys back then, because it took me so long to save up that the stock ran out. Oh well, now at lease I know there are two shops at sunshine plaza selling these One Piece figurines. Hopefully they don't run out of stock again *fingers crossed*. While unpacking the box, I tot the figurines were just one solid item, that was until I popped Zorro‚Äôs big head off while trying to get him out of the wrapper through a small hole I made. HEhehee... His alright, don't worry. I still am impressed with the detailed paintings. I‚Äôm so very sure it was all done by hand, they must be. It was high up with some of my gundam on the top shelve (how stupid can I get, I can even see them), but later I took them down and placed them next to my sister's collection Pooh Bear figurines. There was this star-shaped, chocolate coated biscuits thingy that came in the box, I had no idea what it was, but it‚Äôs not puffed rice of sure. Watched some anime and took an afternoon nap.   Lao Da returned from work with a blocked nose and ears (I think it‚Äôs because she blew her nose too hard), she's really not feeling too well cause it was hurting her a lot just to breath through her mouth. She took her pills and when to bed. Mum and Dad's aren‚Äôt behaving like themselves because of Lao Da, so get well soon.

      Early morning, Mum accompanied Lao Da to the clinic again. They returned with apart of Lao Da's tonsils removed. The Doctor said if it gets any worse, and operation had to be done. Scary~ I had a tummy ache, rush into the toilet before and after gundam seed. And another time much much later. I'm wondering was it something I ate.   Anyone who has the Japanese anime "Fruit Basket" VCD please leave a comment, thankx =) it felt like a Sunday today, with nothing to do during the afternoon. so I took a nap, and dreamt. I dreamt of myself buying a drink from a vending machine, whereby every drink cost $1.05. All I held was a one dollar coin and a fifty cent coin, so I slot it in and got my drink. WAHahahhahahahaaa......... I hit jackpot when the machine return me my change. Lots of gold coins came out, nice shimmering gold coins. The weird thing was they were all not from Singapore. The coins come in all shape and sizes, and I woke up while going through the different types of coins. Sure enough it was a short 45mins nap.  Later this evening, Lao Er kind of left the computer on and chat away on the phone. So I took over, but she orders me not to logout of her msn messenger. And Then I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY! Too bad I couldn‚Äôt get her photo... HEhehee.. Oh well =) Lao Da asked me to decide on a new printer, so we surf the net. She asked for ink that won't smudge, and I was thinking about separated colour cartridges. So we came across the Epson C63, its $50 cheaper then the C60 we bought back then. DAmn, but still I wonder about the ink cartridge price. Hope it‚Äôs cheap and last longer too.   Then I came across an ad selling figurines in somebody's blog, so cute. An ad in a blog, now why didn't I think of that? Though the price wasn't really a steal, but I got them. I don't have the physical thing with me now, but the deal has ended. I've better smash my piggy bank and start counting *evil grin* MUAHahahhahahaaaa..........

      The movie was fine, but I got kind of bored because u already knew what‚Äôs going to happen. But what I'm really puzzled was when did Professor Adrian Hall a paleoclimatologist (a scientist who studies the ways weather patterns changed in the past), ever told his son Sam to hide when the eye of the storm is over them?? Usually I don't mind anyone talking to me during a movie, but Kah Loong was an exception. He was talking through out the whole movie, and he stared at me for no reason. Weird.   So the movie was over, and we made a little trip to sunshine plaza. This time, the figurine stores were all open. There was the One Piece figurines, doreamon too and lots more. The One Piece Island was huge, even larger then what I had in mind. All the figurines were all so cute and detailed. I had a sudden urge to buy them. Too bad for me, what I was eyeing on was out of stock. Here's the website of the figurine shop I was talking about-->> " urlLink www.latendo.com " Next we headed into a gundam shop, cool place. The model there was assembled and so nicely painted, so impressed ^_^.  Then it was another round of window shopping for me at Sim Lim Square. Desmond got himself a new mouse pad, Kah Loong got a new game, and I got myself a nice walk. WAhahaa...  back at home, Lao Er got so angry with the printer because it was printing with lots of unwanted line(its has been like this for weeks), she wanted to fix it. And so she got me involved with the wrecking. This Epson C60 was so much different from the Epson colour 460 I took apart the other time (yes I did wreck the hold printer), this C60 used internal locking system like snap together model kits, instead of screws like the colour 460. I wonder how they would be going about service the C60, with out spoiling the plastic lock. It took me quite a while to remove the casing, what followed was to remove the metal bar. The last time I did that, I didn't know how to put it back. This time I asked Lao Er to clean the printer head with cotton bud, through a gap. Now after that, we wanted to test the printer without the casing on. Jacked in the plug, flick the switch, but the damn thing won't come to live.   Given up rescuing the printer. Lao Er when surfing the net for a new cannon printer. I fiddled with the printer once more, PoUff~! It came back to live. But we didn't do a test print, because we're out of ink. Hahahaa.... all that work with my hands spotted black, and we ran out of iNk! And so the printer is left aside, until some one is kind enough to loan us their colour cartridge for a test print.   HANDS WASHING TIME! BYE~ V(^_^)V

      This is my final piece of work, as u can see, it‚Äôs still uncompleted. Apart from that un shaded 10%, I would do some more detailing on the dragons.    Since Wednesday, my Lao Da has been down with a fever. After her second visit to the clinic yesterday, her fever is still turning on and off. to make matters worst, my Lao Er and mum were not feeling too well either. Could it be me who brought this rapid effect of illness among them?   Mum is at the clinic with my Lao Da this very instance. *sneeze* oh god? Could this be a relapse? Bless you (me)! Ok, its about time i prepare to go out to watch "The Day After Tomorrow" again, but this time round with a bunch of guys. See ya later '~'*sneeze*sneeZe*(who in this world is missing me?)

      I think this is going to be the last time I'm going to book an entry. WAhahahaa... Didn't know there's more post options, until Tara's sister told me. Come to think of it, its was pretty lame of me to had been racing against time to book an entry. Since the last sketch didn't quite fit Tara's standard, I thought of doing a new sketch from scratch. Well, its not totally without any reference. I still had the net as my source of pictures, but I can hardly find any decent screenshot taken from the anime itself. Thus, I had to rely on pictures I've found to figure out the facial feature of the dragons. I had completed a first draft today, but its so damn messy, I dun think I want to post it up. Wait for the second draft to be out will ya?  I had been queuing up for this song call "Without You" by Clay Aiken & Kimberley Locke on mirc for the last one and a half hours, and I think I'm like the 10th in line. *yawnz* Tara's sister offer to help since she wasn't sleeping early , and I was like yawning away. I rejected her offer because I won't want to bother her, and if she were to queue up, she would the 25th in line. Suddenly my dad woke up and headed for the toilet, I switched off the monitor and hopped on to bed. It's just so heartbreaking, all the waiting down the drain. I had to shut down the computer before he notice and send me off to bed. Bah~ nitex

      Hello! It has been such a long pause since I last blogged, I guess I was kind of lazy. Thanks to friends who cared, I was already feeling much better that very night when I had that fever. Fever had gone down to 37.3ÀöC, when I woke up after a totally long nap. Nothing much had happened over the weekends, except for pissing Nova off. I kind of accidentally hinted her secret to her friends, and she was so very furious when that friend of hers called asking. Feeling bad, hope she accepts my apologies.   As for Sunday. Tara came back online after shuai ge fixed the problem. It was a in reality a good news for her sister too, not only did she had excess to the net, she also had peace once Tara is back to surfing the web. HEhhee‚Ä¶. Cute sisters.   Monday, which was yesterday. I rushed out recca‚Äôs eight dragons sketch only to find out I got myself the wrong drawing to refer to. Oh well, it was still the fastest full page sketch I‚Äôve ever did, and also my second completed full page sketch. And since it was a full page sketch, I had to find a nice empty spot to sign. TADA~! sideway signature. Hahaha.. that‚Äôs the only way I can squeeze in my signature.

      Just woke up and feeling a little dizzy sweaty and cold at the moment. Mum placed her hand over my forehead and says that I might be running a fever, so I popped my thermometer into my mouth. True enough, the thermometer reads 38.1ÀöC. This is a normal fever right? If not, I should be resting after taking panadol. Well, as u can see, I‚Äôm not resting. Should have seen this fever coming, because I was already feeling cold after a match. Could it be that I perspired too much bringing my body temperature down too much? But before that was radiating off heat. I wonder~   On the lighter side, today‚Äôs badminton session was an amusing one. We played a paired match, Desmond with LiLing and me with Linus. LiLing returned our smack by hitting the shuttlecock when it bounced off the floor. Since we‚Äôre not playing a proper match already, Linus and I came up with a combo to counted attack LiLing‚Äôs special moves. HEHheee‚Ä¶. Our combo was pretty much something like what you would normally do in a volleyball game, either one of us had to set the shuttlecock so that it was the flying straight up and the other would be smacking the shuttlecock down into opponents‚Äô ground. They even did their own style of combos. I learn how to play smart instead of playing with strength today. For the first few match today, I was running all around and hitting long shots, that undoubtfully end up ‚Äòoutside‚Äô. With stamina dropping quick, I turn to light returns to save my strength. Ended up, everyone was so very close to the net. Then there was this game between me and Desmond, I got the shuttlecock touching the net and falling over to his side of the court, cool huh? Before long we were chase out of the court because our booking time is up.  We went for lunch, well at least they did at block 3‚Äôs coffee shop, which was the closest to our secondary school. I only got myself a drink because I told mum that I‚Äôll be going back home for lunch. Saw my god sister, Mujiao, having her lunch at the coffee shop too. She‚Äôs currently working as a librarian in our secondary school, heard that the pays not bad for a job that she‚Äôs so use to doing. The guys finished eating and it was time to part, we said our good byes and head for home.   After a nice shower and lunch, I went for a nap. And so here we are again, my brain feels like a marble spinning around in my head. Not long after I woke up, Tara‚Äôs SMC (save my computer) message came in.. HEHeheee‚Ä¶. I passed on the problem to Kenneth and he passed it on to his friends. We had thought of all possible solutions, but they all dun seem to work. What to do? It‚Äôs almost 6pm now, I think I better rest. Sorry.

      I‚Äôm feeling lousy today, no event that happened today made me feel that way. It‚Äôs just me and my mood swing again. Normally if I were to wake up while it was dark and gloomy outside, I would be pretty happy and snuggle back underneath my warm blanket. But for today, I stare out the window thinking. Thinking of really silly questions that have no definite answers.  Then the rain comes down hitting the ground telling its secrets, secrets that once I could hear. But now it‚Äôs covered with deep thoughts and emotion. Why is it always so easy to complicate stuff and so difficult to see the simplest of things? Crap, I‚Äôm just typing crap. I drew this sunflower you below to distract myself hallucinating (errmmm.. too strong a word to use, but I think you get the idea.).    For the rest of the afternoon, I did a sketch of a full detailed character. No name for her yet, any suggestions? Maybe one day with a nice story line, I might use her to produce my very own series of Manga. But until that day comes, I shall remain as an architect in training. Packed the room a little, what difference can I make when it‚Äôs my sisters‚Äô stuff all over the place? ARRGGHHhh!   Towards the end of the day, I was feeling a little bit better. Tara gave me a song to search, but she can‚Äôt remember the singer. So I had to gather some clues from her, lucky for me she remembers the lyrics. Having an idea of who the singer was, I searched the net and at the same time, asked around. Thanks to Kenneth, I got to know that there still this server on mirc with that song. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I actually chatted on mirc, but it felt weird using it again after such a long pause. Yupz, I‚Äôve got the song downloaded and sent over to Tara. Got myself a nice long shower, and hopped onto my sister‚Äôs bed. Since I can‚Äôt use the computer because my Lao Er was watching animes, I tuned into Perfect 10 on the radio, or rather Baby T‚Äôs radio. I got bored and so I started forwarding nice sms(s), can‚Äôt let my free sms go to waste now, can I? Cleared Baby T‚Äôs inbox as I replied new messages, can‚Äôt believe I pressing the wrong button sending my unfinished reply into draft. Before long, there was no one to bug on the phone, partly due to my slow replies I guess. Off I went to bed‚Ä¶zzZZ

      I remembered setting Baby T¬ís alarm to go off at eight in the morning, but I didn¬ít hear a thing. It must be the big crash yesterday that made Baby T gone crazy, or could it be that I was in too deep a sleep to notice the alarm going off. I certainly hope it¬ís probably me in too deep a sleep, cause I  can¬ít bear too see my Baby T dying at this young an age.   Even so, I woke up just in time to freshen up and headed straight down to Boon Keng MRT station to meet up with the guys (Amos, Kah Loong and Kenneth Lim). We were supposed to meet up and head on down to P.S. to catch ¬ìHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban¬î together, but we had to leave without Amos because he only woke up after I gave him a call from the station. Onboard the train, we talked about Kah Loong¬ís new phone plans and of cause his new phone as well. He got himself a Nokia 7250i (teal in colour), which I thought looked really slick. I love like his phone a lot, but I¬ím truly happy with Baby T. There¬ís this one feature in Kah Loong¬ís phone which I think most singlish speaking Singaporeans should understand, that¬ís right a ¬ì  L  adio¬î, Kah Loong said. This reminds me of LiLing¬ís joke, which animal can you find in Singapore and starts with the alphabet ¬ìL¬î? The answer to that would be   L  abbit. Cold huh? Well, that¬ís how the joke was meant to be.   Once we got out of the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, we took the lift to the seventh floor of P.S. where Desmond was already waiting. Amos and LiLing came shortly after. Since it was still early to enter the theater, we went for a little morning window shopping. The only setback of going window shopping so early in the morning was that, we would just be looking at closed doors. We were merely riding down the escalator and elevating in the lift just to kill some time. Back at the seventh floor, we stocked up on snacks and combos before entering. For the very first time, instead of sitting in a row like we always do, we were divided into 2 row one behind the other. This is a better layout for conversation.  The movie was great; I believe anyone would enjoy it very much. After the movie, we went down to B1 in search of a place to eat. We made a detour and wandered off into ¬ìAction city¬î, where I had no luck finding those One Piece and Doraemon figurines. We decided to eat at Sim Lim Square as B1 was kind of packed. We passed by Sunshine Plaza with more figurine shops, to get to Sim Lim Square. Sad to say, all those figurine shops were closed for lunch. After lunch, we made our way into Sim Lim Square to get Desmond¬ís graphic card and also LiLing¬ís speaker. We were roaming the place for up to an hour before everything was bought. I came out empty handed, but I was home with lots of fliers.    It was late afternoon when I set foot inside my house, so I turned on this computer and stoned while downloading animes. Then came my teacher who corrected each and every one of my blog entries, after watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on the television. I think she¬ís bore of checking for my mistakes already, so it¬ís up to me to keep my language as perfect as possible. I must do it, I can do it! Cheer on! Though I¬íve got a pretty bad hunch that this particular entry has got more mistakes then I can ever imagine. Thinking back on essay writing, it was always the best to write to the minimum words required. The logic is that the lesser one writes the lesser mistakes one would make. This online English teacher of mine is good at teasing people too, some trait passed down by her sister I guess. Should I be happy or sad when I got teased? I was getting a pretty sour feeling then, I still think its best to forget about it. Now, I can¬ít even tell if I¬ím dumb or just plan old thick skin.  Till the end of today (12 am), I was still blogging and chatting. That explains why I can blog for hours just for this single entry, right?

      It‚Äôs not a special Sunday today, but I woke up at 6am all by myself. Guess I slept too much and it was time for me to get up. You guys should know that everyone wakes up later the usual on a Sunday, my family no droudt is the same. Well of cause I would be the only one awake then, doing my business, washing my face and brushing my teeth. There wasn't any nice shows on the TV listing, so I hopped right back into bed or rather onto mattress and tune in to Power 98 fm on my Baby T (hand phone). Next thing I know, my Lao Er tripped over my hands free bringing my poor Baby T all the way down from above my PC Tower. Poor old Baby T, nothing seems wrong until I gave Tara a call later on. I couldn‚Äôt end the call. I restarted her and it seems to be working just fine, fingers crossed.   After a buffet of anime, I had porridge for lunch. Here‚Äôs where the fun part starts. With the upgrading going according to schedule, the worker will be coming into our house in the coming few weeks. That‚Äôs why my dad thought of wrecking their bed, and kind of rearranging some of the stuff. The bed sure is old, but the wood used to make it sure are some tough nut to crack. It won‚Äôt be so troublesome if we were to have a set of Allen keys (is that how you spell it?). Bed 'dissected' and I discovered some chalk creation underneath one of the wooden plank, I wasn‚Äôt done by me, so what‚Äôs your guess? HEhee‚Ä¶ all the while I thought I was strong until I tried to carry the piece of wood to dump. The pieces were so heavy and huge, I lost balance somewhere down the stair and nearly topple over. PhewP~ close call there.  We moved all the furniture away from the windows which worker will be bringing down soon. Mum & dad will be sleeping on mattress from now on. I grew bored after all the moving, so I started on my gundam modifying again. It didn‚Äôt go too well, like I said, it was messy. It was fun trying it out again anyway. Pretty soon it was dinner, and I threw all the food back down into my throat as usual.

      You know that little nap I was talking about a little while ago, well actually it turns out to be not that little after all. Slept all the way till 6pm, that‚Äôs like 3hours of sleep. Oh god, don‚Äôt think I can fall asleep that early tonight. I woke up once again for dinner, mum and dad bought this boneless duck rice from Kahlang Bahru which I really loved. You don‚Äôt have to go worrying about choking on any bone, because there isn‚Äôt any. When they say boneless, they mean it. Each grain of rise is just perfectly coated with a layer of gravy, every single bit of them. But the finishing touch to this dish is its chili sauces. Now I‚Äôve got to tell you all I really hate chilies, but I‚Äôm ok with this one and I have no idea why. Maybe I should get the stall number from my mum later on and share it with you all, ok? By the way, they won‚Äôt charge you extra if you want to add more rice or chili.   After that, we (My sisters and I) watched ‚Äú50First date‚Äù on the computer as our parents watched some progamme on the television. Second movie of Try thinking making the love of your live(Girlfriend of cause) falling in love with you each and everyday, now how sweet is that? I think it‚Äôs really sweet. So do remember if I do forget you one day, may it be time, aging or just simply I can‚Äôt recall. If you know me, do say hi to me and remind me of all the good things or bad things in my life. Hey, I‚Äôm talking here as if I‚Äôm really old next time. So don‚Äôt come reminding me every single thing after you read this entry, HEhehee‚Ä¶   Then I was stoning in front of the computer again until my friend showed up online, errmmm‚Ä¶ in reality his Rachael‚Äôs cousin. Ivan‚Äôs his name, and he got through the 1st round of Singapore Idol‚Äôs judging. Sad to say his sweet cousin (not Rachael, another one from Australia named Vicky) didn‚Äôt make it. Arrhh.. Poor 16 year old kid, think she‚Äôs going to be ok. ‚ÄúIt was unfair, There were like 200 people in the last group... they were send to different Judges and were not properly informed and treated seriously‚Äù, Ivan said. Well I don‚Äôt really know, what‚Äôs done cannot be changed. Good luck to you.   NOTE: Friends of Rachael, please don‚Äôt go asking her anything about her cousin ok? Because I think she knows nothing about this, and I think she can‚Äôt be bothered. Thankz

      Just came back from P.S. not too long ago. The movie was great, though i've already expected certain events to happen. Hey, but my mum liked it. =) True enough, the place was just empty and people started changing seats. I'm not going to be a spoilsport and blab out the movie, you guys out there reading this, please check this movie out ok? Maybe you'll learn that keeping a promise till the end could mean a lot to someone waiting.   Grab some prawn tako balls as we headed down to the mrt station. Mum never did like the watery uncooked texture of the balls.. Huh... Woke up earlier then usual today, so I think I might catch a little nap later~

      Its Friday again, a day I like while schooling, and day I hate during holidays. Time really flies, got to live with no regrets. I tune into every radio station, and they all have one thing in common. The DJs keep on repeating its a Friday, so chill. ARRGHH I HATE FRIDAYS DURING HOLIDAYS, its feels like counting down till school reopens. Anyway, I got to fell in love with this song on air, its call Accidentally In love by Counting Crows. You'll find this song familiar, because it was taken off the sound track from Shrek II. A truly electrifying song, but sorry guys for I still have no idea how to share it with you on this blog. If you do have the time and patients, do look for it on the net or something (hopefully it‚Äôs not illegal), it‚Äôs a great song.   I think I've lost the momentum to continue with the cards, instead I'm doing another sketch with marker and colour pencils. Well, it didn't turn out too good. But it was a nice try, might even put this skill of colour sketch to good use in my course. Shortly after that sketch was done, I fell asleep and waking up to welcome dinner into my tummy. After dinner, I came back online to download and watch a few animes. Stoning was all I could do after that.  S T O N I N G . . .

      Hey Guys, I've found out somewhere on the net where you can listen to Accidentally In Love by the Counting Crows. But a winamp player is require on your computer, without further ado, here's the  urlLink site .   Tonight, somebody reminded me that I'm a little pervert, a pretty irritating one. How should I react? I guess, I've got to accept and change. As much as I don't like to go back to the quiet me, still I got to or I will have friends leaving me I guess.   WAHahhaa! Tara looked me up for another game of Hexic, such determination. I‚Äôm feeling kind of bad to have left half way into her game for a shower, leaving her with no competitor and definitely no mood to play. I'm sorry girl.  I've bought tickets (actually only 2) to catch "The Day After Tomorrow" with my Mum. I bet she have forgotten the last time she went of a movie, shame on my dad. HEhheee... She's a pretty hardworking Mum lah, taking care of us 24hours non stop. Since I got paid from Tara's job, I thought of treating her to this movie. My sister's are joining us too, but they are going to pay for themselves =p. Hopefully my Mum understands what's going on in the movie, you know the Chinese subtitles for thrillers really flashes by fast, hope she can catch them. I‚Äôve just checked the seats again online. Apart form us four, only five other seats have been taken up. The privilege of going for an early morning movie is that you'll get whole cinema to yourself. =) LalalAlal~

      Live after marriage, hmmmmmmmm..... Now shrek II would be a really cool movie to describe it in a magical fantastically way. Sacrificing for each other, even changing. But all that doesn't matter, its finding out and remembering how and why couples fell in love with each other again that is more important. With that in mind, one can always treasure and cherish their love ones. Married man should be happy, cause they have their entire life time to pursue their wife. HEhehe like that phrase a lot. Hey, check Shrek II out if you haven been to the cinema for like months.  Ahh.... For the rest of the day, I was too lazy to start on any cards. slack slack slack slack slack.........

      Singapore so small that I nearly met Tara at the edge(only the timing was off), and just two train stations away from where her er jie was. =)  Played a game on msn I haven touched in months since Tara got busy and her com was down. Anyway, it just means a long long time.  Hexic  is the name of the game, and I've top it (at least on my chart) Tara says she missed it, my guess is she have not given up beating my score my guess. Well, she's pretty close behind I guess. Next on the chart after me, she really can play hard man.   Then there was this other game we played,  Bejewel , a game I was totally not in luck with. I wonder if there was a trick to this game, she made it all the way to the top with out barking a sweat in one go. As for me, eight games and I didn't budge an inch on the chart. Did I mention that out of the eight games, five of them I was cussed with no more moves after jus seven to ten moves. So when I say she plays hard, I mean it.

      My Lao da's friends called to ask if we're interested in this Korea-Sing exchange programe, we only have to pay for the air tickets. Boy do i wanna go. If i'm lucky enough, might even meet some cute korean girls. Might even be leaving under the same roof with one. =D.... (drooling) best thing is that all we have to do is stay with them for five days, and they won't have stay with us. Sad to say, i can't make it. its from the 28th June to 4th July... sad man... so its up to my sisters... sigh... time to go.. byez~

      Woh! So tired~  Just came back from Jurong East, which wasn't part of the destination today. I was suppose to go out with my Lao Da to Sim Lim Square to stock up on some CD-R(s), and then to Bugis Junction's cold storage to look for pans for making cheese cake. So we got our CD-Rs and headed towards Bugis. Lao Er called, asking us to make a trip down to the Akira building down at Jurong East to get her and her Honey each a set of cordless phone which was on sales. So we agreed.  Coming out form cold storage with the pans, I dragged my Lao Da to the edge with me. Silliest thing was that I walked out when the lift stopped at the second floor, I could have swore that I saw the display showing the third floor. We walked around once, twice. Scanning through every store, especially those which sells small figurine items and weird stuff =x. Still I don't see any doraemon or one piece figurine which Tara describe. It's getting late, so we got onto the train and headed downwards to Boonlay.  Along the way, I feel asleep standing like I always do when I go to school. Now this was the first time I've actually got off that station. There was free shuttle service to take us to Akira, once again I dragged my Lao Da to walk with me. *yawn~ Big mistake, I can hardly catch my breath when we reached. Sad to say, we were late. All the $59.90 sets were sold out, what's left was another model which cost $109. Called Lao Er to make confirmation and she's willing to pay more. Its limited to one person per set, so I had to walk up to the casher and pay. ARRGGHHH there goes my pay!!! She better returns it to me!!!   Outta Akira and towards IMM to get a drink. We got the new sundae float, which is like the original float. When I say like the original, I mean the ice cream will be had to reach when you finish your soda. Having the ice cream stuck with the ice cubes was bad enough, the addition of hot fudge makes it impossible to suck anything up. Next Someone else called, it was Lao Da's friend asking her to meet up. DAmn DAmn DaMn!!! Now I have to carry everything back home. Shouldn't had played with those dumbbells earlier on. So here I am, back home with aching arms again.

      Just finished watching "The Wedding Panner", when it was suppose to be small vile. What a wonderful and lovely show. How do they do it man? Love seems so simple, so perfect. Well at least the wedding was, that must be why they didn't film live after marriage. But who knows, maybe love that last do exist. Anyway, picked up a few lines from the show. HEheee.... Simple words, beautiful language. How I wish I can just come out with all those gorgeous phrase. Arhh, wedding sure is beautiful.   OK, now everyone in this house is sleeping. What should I do? Lao da bought this vcd titled "My Girl", its a Thai movie telling a story of a very young first love. Cute huh? At only age 10. At age 10, food is what matters to me most. HEhee... Its such a shame I don't have any primary school pictures. I was such a pig then, my sisters use to call me an alien cause I was so chubby, my eyes looked a lot like a line behind those  HUge ,  s q u a r e i s h ,  O ~ biang  looking spectacles. I bet you guys won't believe its me at all. Back then I was called ugly. Now, I'm not handsome, just any other normal looking Chinese guy u might find on the street. But still I like my face then, cause it was fair and flawless. For now, I have to look into the mirror seeing the face of moon with craters so big, you can even see it with your naked eyes.  Hhmmm....... getting way outta point there. With narrowing eye sight, I guess I will not be watching that vcd now. =√æ

      What go you know? I'm running out of simple cards to draw. All i can complete today was  urlLink The Firey  and  urlLink The Flower  before my thumb and index finger cramp. Guess i was holding the pencil a little too tight, and there was so many lines to draw to darker. But these two cards sure look damn good, don't you agree? I still have some simple cards left, so i guess i'll start on those tommorw morning and make my way to the toughtest card, which i think is "The Wood" card (lots of leaves to darw). Well before that, think i'm gonna rest my fingers first. *yawn~*

      Had a pleasant dream with her in it (not a dirty one thank you). Guess I was just thinking too much of her before I slept. Her who? Her - The girl of my dreams. Name? I‚Äôm not going to tell you. =p  In school, we were brief on what to take note of at the site. The brief ended in less then an hour, and so we the brothers moved on to the site (old warehouses beside the gallery hotel) without waiting for our tutors and classmates. Even so, we have to stop at Sumerset station for the tutors to lead the way. Let‚Äôs see, we jaywalked to the Singtel building right outside the left exit of the station. Then we passed by the ‚ÄúMistress Block‚Äù (where man‚Äôs kept their mistress as told by our tutors). Pass by River Valley Primary School before reaching out site. Boy was it a ‚ÄòShort Walk‚Äô. I fell like a blur cok over there and I dun even know where to start off. Should have read the brief earlier and planned ahead, LAZY ME. My group dispersed leaving me scrolling around there, well at least I did 1 sketch of the Robertson Bridge.  I wonder how Tanjie is doing, her reply seems so lifeless. Anyway, the brothers except for Lester gather and had a little ‚ÄúChildish Period‚Äù before we head on down to Cineleisure B.K. for lunch.

      There weren‚Äôt any tutorials today, only LC class this afternoon. Woke up early, but was spending the hold morning trying to do my LC write up draft. ‚ÄúTrying‚Äù is the word, I don‚Äôt even know how to start. Along the way, I don‚Äôt feel like going to school. I mean, going to school just for a 2 hours LC lecture, I might as well stay home for the rest of the day doing other stuff. Hiya, but I‚Äôve got no excuses to not go. I rather keep those ‚Äúponning‚Äù days when I really need to skip classes and still keep a good attendance. Yupz, so I went to school. It was boring, even Lester fell asleep during lesson. Those 2 hours feels like half my lifetime, everybody ran out once the class is over. Ha‚Ä¶ guess it was just too horrible.  All was fine, dinner, TV, web surfing‚Ä¶ Until‚Ä¶. Hmmmmmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ guess I shouldn‚Äôt blog the details‚Ä¶ Tanjie, if you‚Äôre reading this. Hope u feel better after crying. Have a good nights rest after finishing what you can complete.

      Went food hunting at PS with Cher Hao after school today, no comments with the presentation today (I guess it‚Äôs the same with everyone presenting today). I was intending to go home and sleep my mind out, but I tagged along with Cher Hao into Carrefour for snacks. He got some chips, sushi & mix nuts. I was just scanning around the chocolate section, and then I saw meji‚Äôs birthday bears! So I went through all the boxes trying to find my birth bear, Cher Hao helped too. We took the boxes off the shelf and were looking like 2 idiots. Guess I was outta luck today, no we didn‚Äôt find my bear. Anyway, we stacked the boxes back neater then before we took it down. =x. ok, now it‚Äôs his turn to tag along with me. It ACTIONCITY time! There‚Äôs new evangelion and onepiece candy toy. Ohya, there was these Haro balls that holds character from earlier gundam series. The Haro looks cute, but its ears doesn‚Äôt open (its just one hollow sphere made out of 2 domes)‚Ä¶.   I‚Äôm home‚Ä¶..zzzZZZ

      Woke up with a block nose, this is not a good sign at all. Body‚Äôs aching all over, I can‚Äôt even sit on my bottoms. I was looking at the clock as it closing in to 9:45am, and I got a sms at 9:44am. AAAhhhhhhh‚Ä¶.. just one more minute, just one more minute!!! I didn‚Äôt get a chance to break my miss call record. Why oh Why can‚Äôt sleeping beauty sleep a little longer? Sigh~  Around noon, got another sms from Tara‚Ä¶ Oohh‚Ä¶ she got herself another Doraemon from comics connection around my place. With 3more to go, I think she getting more and more anxious. Hehehheee‚Ä¶.. ok back to me. I am feeling damn weak, so I slept a lot more. Wake up and sleep, wake up and sleep, wake up and sleep‚Ä¶. There wasn‚Äôt much I could do, except for stoning in front of the com before dinner time, and watching tv programs.   Cannot Tahan any longer, I took Panador cold and hopped into bed. Then I realize that channel 8 was showing GTO special, and I stay wide awake watching it‚Ä¶

      Oh man~ it‚Äôs raining. Luckily it‚Äôs not a full day of rain. The rain stopped around 10am+ and the basketball session with Gang was postponed to 12noon. I‚Äôm getting weak in this game, a drop in stamina, strength, reflex and jumping height. And pretty soon, my right calf cramped and I had to drag myself off the court. Ooppss wrong move, my right thighs and toes cramped too as I moved. I can alone watch them play for the rest on the day.  It was 4pm+ when we made our way to Bendemeer shopping mall for lunch. Then Desmond had to bring up that Shuying remark on not seeing me in SP lately, as if I had some kinda special relationship with her. I kept quite‚Ä¶ At the coffee shop, we got our seats and I was left to guard their stuff as they went to order their food. GREAT, my god sista (MuJiao) came along and so I waved. She U turned and headed for me. WHY IS MY GANG STARING AT ME LIDDAT??? She was standing beside me asking how‚Äôs life and stuff while I was sitting, well of cause I‚Äôll ask her to sit down, and she did. THERE GOES THE STARING EYES AGAIN! And Desmond started the special relationship talk again. I got him over to sit with us and talk about Poly life. After ordering their food, the guys returned and moved away with Desmond to another table leaving MuJiao and me alone. WahLiew~ please loh, she‚Äôs attached‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got someone in mind le, so quit thinking that I‚Äôm some kind of playboy or big flirt leh. I think she got kinda embarrass and left, but all those small talk didn‚Äôt fade away.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I knocked out as soon as I step into my home, all the way till 8pm. I took a shower before having dinner. Then I saw a shocking SMS on Baby T which came in which I was sleeping. TARA bought the Gundam Karapuchi set together with 11 more doreamons from the shop I intro her to. $63 on a single receipt just on figurines, such a serious collector sia. HAhahaa‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs smart man‚Ä¶ can even find the right shop from the ugly messy map I drew for her. Aiya, again I was chase off the com. This time I popped my head right above Lao Er‚Äôs head, and she was having a little chit chat with Tara.First, it was about her doramon collection, then it was about her grades and stuff. Stuff including not disturbing Tara.. Humhp~ blah blah blah‚Ä¶. zzzZZZ&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Tutorial starts at 8am today, and it‚Äôs going to be a long day. From 8am till 2.45pm we were in the com lab trying to finish up our write up, with lunch break in between of cause. In the lab, I felt my body temperature dropped rapidly. I was shivering and my last finger went numb. If I were to stay in there any longer, I‚Äôll pengz loh‚Ä¶ Taking short walk in and out of the com lab, warmed me up just a little. 2.45pm!!! I‚Äôm done with my work, same goes with Shawn‚Ä¶ Finally I can leave that freezing lab. We (Shawn and me) went to another com lab which was much warmer to print out our write ups, but I didn‚Äôt want to return to the freezer that early so we stayed there playing Bowman while waiting for the others to send us their work to print.   It was a battle of stamina I tell you, we were there trying to shoot each other down for 1hr+. ohya, and Tara got herself 4 more doraemons, bringing her collection up to a total of 11 doraemon figurines. And she was so tempted to buy this gundam seed karapuchi she saw at the same comics connection she bought her doraemons from. After, all the figurines talk (sms), she took a short nap. Just nice, Cher Hao &amp; the girls‚Äô work are all done and sent to my school server space for printing. Yupz I left the com signed in under my name back at the freezer on, that‚Äôs why they can excess my server space. Shawn and I did this ‚ÄúPay Up!‚Äù drawing and saved in my server space to let Cher Hao see. And when we got back, lots of 5cents were on my desk‚Ä¶ WAhahhahaaa‚Ä¶.   Work all handed up, yeah! But Desmond, Kenneth they all have already left school after badminton. It‚Äôs so disappointing that I couldn‚Äôt join them. Well, you can‚Äôt always have things to go your way can you? Did a little figurine search for Tara back at home. She was so tempted to buy the gundam karapuchi and was like can‚Äôt decide. So I suggested for her to flip the coin. Head means to buy, Tail means to buy it later. HAhahahaa‚Ä¶ I guess she was fated to get them after all, 3 toss and 3 heads. So I told her where the shop was, with a very ugly map. Soon I was chase off the computer by Lao Er.

      School starts at 10am today, but I had to wake up at 7am to finish what is left of my draft write up before showing it to my tutor again. After a little washing up and breakfast, I started on my work. Soon it was 8.49am, I dashed out the front door after I changed and a splash of water on my face to keep me away. I was there at Dover early and waited for the rest of the brothers to come, but Cher Hao and I left Shawn (still on his way to Dover) since it was running late. We ran to class, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I ran, but it was damn tiring. It really isn‚Äôt fair to have faculty located so far away from the Dover station. Yupz we made it in time to get out attendance marked. After the lecture, Shawn and I lets Mr Yen read out write out. I wonder did he really go through every word.   Well anyway, we were reluctant to head for our LC class (English lesson) after the earlier lecture. Shawn was asking me if I would like to join him later on to go NY to see someone, and the rest of Brothers wanted to head for home to get a rest. But Cher Hao just had to turn up for LC just because he needed to show his M.C. to the LC tutor, and we were to accompany him. Class ended early cause we were requested to go get our presentation topics from our own lecture. Sadly I was stuck in the com lab for the next 2hr30min with Cher Hao just because our lecturer was not in. Cher Hao was supposed to do his write up, but instead 45mins was spent playing &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/bowman.html  with me. HEHEHeheheee.... I won him 45mins into the game!!! It was 5pm when we finally got our presentation topics.   5pm: Shawn was back in school waiting for the rest of his rugby friends to make their way down to NYJC for training. We could have met and traveled together if it weren‚Äôt for that tortoise Cher Hao. So I didn‚Äôt go down NY, but who will still be there by the time I reached? Back at home, all was usual. I sat down in front of the com eating back and white M&Ms which looked something like those black and white seeds used in Chinese board game. On Msn, Tara was having a verbal constipation. Heheheee‚Ä¶. When she used that expression I was both amused &amp; disgusted. Amused, because I never though those two words can come together. And disgusted, because if she remember what she was going to say, I would be her toilet bowl. Hahhaa‚Ä¶ Just Kidding. So she remembered, and told me all about this wonderful gift her dad got her from his Cambodia trip. Everything about it was so very nice, she repeated, from the aroma oil down to its woodwork packaging. Lao Er popped beside me and saw our conversation, and then she started to compare her gifts. POOR OLD ME, I had to sample all the perfumes/ aroma oils Lao Er has. My nose was all irritated after that man. Getting bored, I checked my hotmail in box to find only one e-mail from Tara. Hahhaa.. It was about the things that had happened in our lives when we were young. This wasn‚Äôt the first time I had received such mails, but it never fails to make me smile and laugh about the things we used to love, hate and do.   Tara went to bed before 2am, good for her. 30mins later, I couldn‚Äôt hold out too‚Ä¶ so  Z-+m  NitE&nbsp;&nbsp;

       *Shivers*   &nbsp;  I don‚Äôt want to go to school that early today, the wind‚Äôs blowing cold. It‚Äôs a day to stay and sleep at home, why oh why do I have an early class today? Tutorial from 8am to 3pm, how sick is that? I practically stared at the monitor the hold day, until bothers five started playing games on ebaumsworld.com. There was  urlLink Penguin Bat ,&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Home Run  and lots more. We got so bored that we spin ourselves on our chair and tried to walk straight, kind of like the game Home Run. Funny sia, Cher Hao went sideway walking and landed himself on the floor. We were really enjoying that before school was over. On the way towards Dover Station, Cher Hao keeps on asking us to slower our pace. If I‚Äôm not wrong, we spin him too much and he‚Äôs all ready to throw up. Hahaha‚Ä¶ its play time for Shawn and me. We acted liked we were going to puke to disgust Cher Hao, but too bad I had to alight at my stop and not see him puke.  &nbsp;  When I got home, animes were waiting for me. Yupz, Lao Er downloaded them while I was in school. So I decided keep my homework for later and anime marathon it was. I went back to ebaumsworld.com later again, and shattered my previous record for Home Run with 86 meter. Hehehhehe v ^_^ v. Very soon it was dinner time and also show time. AND THEN!!!!! Poof~ the lights went out with every other electrical appliance (just a section of the hold block). My parents disappeared into the dark, it‚Äôs now my Baby T and me. Wonder why I did it, but I manage to send out one ‚Äú Blackout! ‚Äù sms before the lights came back. Sigh~ just when I was so happy about not doing my work, the lights just had to come back. Blackout that lasted less then a minute, that must be the doings of the renovation workers. Lao Er was using this pc afterwards, so I had to use her laptop to do my draft write up. Laying down and doing silly write up, my eyelids suddenly feels like a thousand kilograms. Have to wake up at 6 to kick Lao Er off her bed and 7 to do my write up.  &nbsp;    Knock Out!

      For this past week, I‚Äôve been thinking am I really up to the sleepless night challenge? Day after day, reaching school early and leaving late. Once home, I still need to do research on the net till ‚Äòearly‚Äô morning. And worse of all, I felt asleep right after the first comical break in between ‚ÄúHai You Ming Tian 2‚Äù, which happens to be the last episode. Stupid, stupid,stupid, I‚Äôve watch every one episode from the every beginning, but I had to miss the last one. Stupid me, stupid tiredness, stupid rushy project. Work, work, work‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs goes the rest of the week. Friday however, I manage to catch a six hours afternoon nap (2:30pm-8:30pm). Six full hours, I guess I was just too tired. Anyway, Lao Er returned soon after I woke up with lots of stuff. There were roses, candies, jelly, chocolate and plastic wrapper. Amused, I stood by and watched. Next, I was given the job to cut the wrappers in pieces and ribbons. Lao Er didn‚Äôt tell me how many short ribbons to cut so I went on and on until I asked her ‚Äúcan I stop?‚Äù Funny? I don‚Äôt know, but everyone laughed.  &nbsp;  Back to work, I was just wrecking my mind just to find nice words and phrases to explain my findings and analysis. Took me quite some time to re-read, correct and add on some more sketches. It was around 4am, when I went to bed. Bright and early later that day, Lao Er and I took the same train. She was going to work with a bag of roses, and I was going to school to pass my work to my group mates. Seeing her with so many roses, I can‚Äôt help but laugh (I‚Äôve no idea why). We went out separate ways at Outram park station.  &nbsp;  I was too early, so I seated at a study area and trying to beat my own timing for a game (sega rally n gage) before one of my brother (Cher Hao) finds out and tries to make a spot in the chart. He came along and took Baby T from my hands, and he played with my car settings and made it in the chart. We met up with two more brothers (Shawn &amp; Dan) before making our way down to DE‚Äôs faculty. I left Baby T with Cher Hao and met up with my group mates. We were able to hand in out work much much ealier, but because all the members in the group should be present for submission, we ended up being the last few because of a late member. I was worried at first, but our work was in on time, so I just kinda forget about her being late. But the rest my group was pulling a long &amp; black face. By the time I returned to Cher Hao, he already top the chart with a name I must try to get rid of. Now I‚Äôve to get five races with a timing of 13seconds and above. Headache‚Ä¶      Got a little keeSiao... So i took Lao Er'S PiGgY Head And Place It Over Mine WheN i ReaChed hoMe... Later that nigth, there was this korean movie called ‚Äúone day‚Äù about this couple, undergoing artificial fertilization (I don‚Äôt know the medical terms) because the male‚Äôs sperms are weak. It was a success and everyone was happy until three months later when the doctor diagnose that the fetus was down with an illness that lets it continue developing without a brain. The mum didn‚Äôt want to give her child up because they have waited just too long, she just wanted her baby to see the world, even if it is just for one day. The baby was born and it was heart breaking for her mum to see her in the incubation box. So she decided to end her baby's&nbsp;suffering and help other infant with organ transplant needed. Sad story, what is it with korean movies??  &nbsp; As for today, I began full slack mode rigth after i didn have to make a morning call to Tara, cause she sms me that she's awake. Then it was anime breakfast time! Seigaku lost a double's match?? think so, I guess that's what i missed out on last week. Well, they didn won the second double's match. CAN"T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK"S MATCH!! switch the channel after that and there was this new cartoon "Teen Titans" showing on kids central. It was weird seeing kiddy super hero, not comments on them. As for the 30mins one piece, thank god KC repeated their last episode if not I won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. &nbsp; afternoon... stone stone stone...  yupz thats all, i've been doing&nbsp;for the pass few hours... till next week, Tata

      Woke up like seven in the morning to dress up for Lao er's graduation ceremony. I was in white shirt & black pants, same thing Lao Er was is. She laughed, but I don‚Äôt know why. All prepared and ready to go, we hail for a cab and made our way down to NUS with all her barang barang. Dad didn‚Äôt come with us because there were only three invitations and my dad doesn‚Äôt really like to dress up. Oh well, I got to know why Lao Er laughed when I reach there. All the graduates were in white shirt/blouse and black pants, boy do I fit in. Hehehe‚Ä¶ The ceremony was about to begin, so she went to change into her graduation gown as we made our way into the hall. What luck we had, to be seated at the center 3rd row from the stage. Nothing much I‚Äôll say, it was like any graduation with a lot of applause (the usual stuff). There were some funny grandaunts with silly actions that brought laughter out of the applauses. The ceremony  ended with balloons and pieces of paper coming down from the very top of the hall, so grand sia.   Alright out of the hall, I was being pulled around by Lao Er just because I was her cameraman. Went around the engine faculty taking photos, some of them were totally silly. When that is done, she took off her gown and Toa PaYoh we went. First, I was asked to open up another saving account when I accompanied Lao Er to withdraw money. Then there was this uncle who sited next to me in Crystal Jade Toa PaYoh who asked if I‚Äôm from the NTU Fag. Do I really look that old? I‚Äôm still a poly student for goodness sake! Thankx Lao Er for her treat. When around the shops there and got myself a pear of ‚ÄòBanana‚Äô shoes before we head back home. ARhh‚Ä¶ REST TIME..

      ‚ÄúLast Present‚Äù a Korean movie just ended. Even though I started watching half way into the movie, it never fails to make my eyes wet. I wonder if death in love is a typical Korean movie ending, it really is a story about the love of our live. Some were some how, some one could have been having a crush on you, even holding onto that though of ending up together silently without you even knowing. It is a nice thought to hold on to, I wonder‚Ä¶ Nah, who would have a crush on me man? I‚Äôm just a boring, cheapskate, lazy crap who only loves to sketch. Should I touch a little on my crush? YOU WISH!! HAhahhahaa!! Its only for her to know one day, one fine day went she‚Äôs ready know.  *Note: by then, it might already be too late*  Well, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôll just hold onto the thought and continue with our separate lives until time itself. Yes, time which everything, everyone have to pass through. I shall mark a spot on time, no matter what the ending, that day will come.  Hey, for now I should bury myself back into studies man and get a good job afterwards. I mean, which girl would want to go out with a guy without a secured job? Am I not right to say that? I‚Äôm not saying all girls are after rich guys with high post, but I‚Äôm sure all of them want to find a sense of security in their man won‚Äôt they? Aiya, crap, must be the movie‚Äôs doing. Anyway, I don‚Äôt have time to analyze this, post your comments ok? Time to get my head banging into concrete, HEhee‚Ä¶

      Oh ya, I‚Äôve got a call saying I‚Äôve won a lucky draw thingy and asked if I remember eating in a restaurant (couldn‚Äôt catch its name). I when like ‚Äúhuh, did I?‚Äù So she repeats the question again, and I replied ‚Äúnope‚Äù And she asked if I‚Äôm Daniel Tan, well of cause I said no. What‚Äôs up with my phone number man? So many wrong callers calling in and this last call was just so funny. The caller got my surname alright, just that I‚Äôm not called Daniel. Wonder what did that lucky guy won, Hehehe~

      Its Friday today, and I thought I could relax over the weekend. I was wrong. I have to summaries what I‚Äôve written regarding the technological aspect and issues on Punggol HBD flats by tomorrow, so that I can send it to my group leader to consolidate all our work. Another sleepless night, sigh.  Yeah, today we celebrated all the May, June and July Bibi‚Äôs Birthday with a 2.5kg choco cake. Hahahaa, it was so funny even though no one was ‚Äòplasted‚Äô with the chocolate cream. We the borthers each took a piece of cake and went after the ‚Äòorganizer‚Äô, who ended up running into the female‚Äôs toilet. So we stood outside the toilet waiting of our chance. She sticks her head out like a tortoise from it shell. Seeing her so scared, we retreated. But it was so damn funny when she ran when we were just walking towards her.   It all ended so fast, and it was back to the com with research on an overseas architect‚Äôs work this time. Here‚Äôs the slow part, try sitting in front of the monitor for another 4hours (I did 3+hours of research before that) looking for the same old guy‚Äôs work. Arrhhhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

      Ahhh~ my work studio got a fresh coat of brilliant warm colours, a blend of bright orange, cheerful yellow and untainted white. How I envy the new Year Ones, they have got the latest computer and in their labs. Why oh why didn‚Äôt we get an upgrade last year? Why do we have to suffer waiting for excess to faster computers? Anyway, I‚Äôm glad that my final project last year is now being showcase. We went looking for our pass tutors, and they were having fun with the new year ones. Hey, they were playing games. I don‚Äôt recall my batch playing games with the tutors during the beginning of the year. Instead, we were greeted with a project right away. The year ones this year surely are enjoying a lot of stuff all thanks to our feedback last year.   Alright, back in the E studio (com lab ‚Äòclass room‚Äô from now onwards), we gathered in our groups discussing on what we had done on the Punggol site analysis. We‚Äôre so lost that we would need a torchlight as bight as the sun to guide us through. Oh no, after asking the tutor I think I‚Äôm further at lost now then ever. Not knowing what to do, I headed into web surfing to gather more info. In that way, even if I have no idea what to do, at least I‚Äôll have some materials to discus with the rest of my group even though I‚Äôm not doing my work. I don‚Äôt want to dwell on the technology part of this report, it‚Äôs the most straight forward part yet there‚Äôs so little data to be collected.   Got home early today, so I took an afternoon nap. Now I‚Äôm up and doing more research on the net, and I‚Äôm still feeling sleepy. I can‚Äôt wait for the weekends to come. Oh yah, I can‚Äôt stand this beetle that has been flying around in this room. The beetle keeps on clinging on to my hair even after I brushed it off.

      I should blog this before I get busy can forget what had happened today. First day of my second year life, I was appointed the assistant class rap. Two new faces showed up in our class, a guy & a girl. It should take some time for them to get use to us and our class motto ‚Äòif you‚Äôre not doing, so will I‚Äô. HEhehee‚Ä¶ Maybe even longer‚Ä¶ Ohya almost forgot, LESTER LOST HIS N GAGE‚Ä¶ now there‚Äôs no body that will play with me le‚Ä¶. Sob Sob‚Ä¶  As soon as we turned up in school, an assignment was already waiting for us. We have to work in groups assigned by out tutors, not the groups we had in mind. The Brothers Five (a gang of 5 dirty minded guys & an innocent girl following us around) has been scatted except for Cher Hao & Dan as they are in one group. After we were brief on what to do, we set off to Punggol Block 101 where the sail landmark is. We didn‚Äôt get lost over there and even reached the sail before the lecturers.  I have to say I‚Äôm really at lost on what to do over there, so my group split up the work. I‚Äôm covering materials and the reasons so it. I though simple task for me as it was very straight forward, that was until I came across materials that I don‚Äôt know how to name. Did some 2D technical rough drawings on how different material elements were actually put together. Taking notes on recyclable materials and fa√ßade treatment with materials. Then we headed to the sky garden above a car park near by, I don‚Äôt fell elevated at all because the garden was enclosed. After gathering just about enough details, my group planned for the next trip and dispersed.   And so the Brothers Five gathered, making a trip back to Compass point to get a little something as a birthday present of our brother Dan who didn‚Äôt turn up for the field trip. Sure enough, we got him a ‚Äòlittle‚Äô something. =^_^=.. we got him a G-string, well not exactly one because there only has a stripe that goes around the waist and a ‚Äòpouch‚Äô for the ‚Äòyou know where‚Äô. I spent so much time laughing as we chose the colour and size that my cheeks cramped. Poor Shawn was made to pay for it, and my poor bag was used to keep it. Even now, it‚Äôs still inside my bag. Don‚Äôt think I want to unpack my bag today.   Okie, it‚Äôs time off dinner le, and after that I‚Äôll be doing some research. BubbyeZ~

      There was this Taiwan television programme called, TV3, showing this late afternoon on channel 8. I missed the front part of the show where they held games in their studio, but I manage to catch the last segment of the show where by the hosts helps people sort out their relationships. Today‚Äôs situation starts off with an army man wanting to check out on his girlfriend, to see if she‚Äôs seeing another guy. So the hosts went on a spying trip following the girl around. For three continues days, the hosts keep seeing the same old guy hang out with the girl, fetching her off from work, going out for dinner even buying her jewelry. They even spotted the girls best friend (another girl) quarreling with both the older guy & her. Poor army guy got a breaking up call from the girl his following off day. And the hosts showed him all the video they had capture and also asked his ex‚Äôs best friend out. And she reviewed that his ex‚Äôs is actually seeing someone else. The girl was asked to hold a meeting with army man‚Äôs ex and the army man, the host and the rest of the crew sits in another room watching the happening via a pinhole cam. What they didn‚Äôt expect was army man‚Äôs ex brought along that older guy, who army man discovered was his cousin. Is that messy or what? Army man wanted to pick up a fight but the crew stopped him. The army man ask his cousin to take care of his ex while he was serving his country, and sure enough he did (a little too much). And that best friend of his ex was actually helping him. Are we talking about a 4 way relationship here? I don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs two things to conclude here, #1 its hard to maintain a relationship when a guy is serving the army and #2 there are other‚Äôs who care. =)  Ok so the show was over, and I took a little nap until 8pm. That‚Äôs when Tara‚Äôs sister, Keshia, greeted me with a BIG ‚ÄòBOO‚Äô. I thought it was fun so I ask where she got the add-on. It‚Äôs  urlLink  here , go try it out‚Ä¶ HEhee‚Ä¶ So I kinda play with the add-on programme, drawing panda‚Äôs, instant emoticons and even tracing out doreamon (and I kena condemned by Tara for insulting her hero). It‚Äôs not easy using a mouse to write and draw, just wait till I get myself a stylus. Yeah, and soon it was time to watch THE EYE on channel 8. It was my first time watching, but I thought it was kind of funny, I can‚Äôt help but to laugh with I saw a female ghost licking her husband‚Äôs char shew. And also when I saw the ghost on the train. Back in front of my com, we (Tara, Keshia & me) held a little gundam seed conversation in Keshia‚Äôs Blog. Funny sia, I have no other comments on that. Hehee‚Ä¶ WHAT WILL KIRA YAMATO DO NEXT? Stay tuned~

      I have spent the last week of my holidays in silent at home playing The Sims Bustin Out. YupZ, nothing else but playing. It wasn‚Äôt such a bad game, and it only took me not more then a full week to complete all of its missions.  I still feel kinda bad having to let my sim wet his pants every now and then. HEhehe~ It has been raining in the early mornings, and there‚Äôs nothing better to do then to snugger under the comfort of my own blanket.  I didn‚Äôt get any good rest last night. Remember the rains that has been falling, well it kind of brought along a fleet of mosquitoes. And I was like stung from head to toe, itching to death. Even after I wrapped myself in my blanket, they will just keep coming buzzing next to my ears, how annoying. I got so irritate scratching, that I woke up to get a glass of water (3am this morning). I went like ‚ÄòWow~‚Äô the moon‚Äôs so bright, it even lit up my kitchen. I guess I was so tired, the itch didn‚Äôt matter anymore and I ..zzZZ all the way.   With the room lit up by the warm morning rays, I saw the horrors those fleet did to me. Let‚Äôs sum up the damage they did, 2 bites on my left upper arm, 3 on my left thigh and 1 on my right thigh. And look at all the red scratch marks they made me leave behind. ARGhhh‚Ä¶.   Finally, my fringe‚Äôs touching the tip of my nose. I admit it‚Äôs a pretty dumb thing to be all excited about, but it took me a full 2+months to keep my hair this long. Now that my target has been acquired, I think it‚Äôs time I go for a trim, well maybe tomorrow. Heheheh~. Alright, its lunch time. Chao~

      Here I am blogging before my Lao Er's sunny boi boi drop by for dinner and watch the NDP telecast together. Boring day, no interesting shows on the television. So I took out a stack of papers Lao Er dug out while clearing the room last night, and started drawing. Did a few circles shading, and got kinda bored with back & white. Pouring out what's in my pencil case, I've got a blue pen, yellow highlighter, 0.1 drawing marker and a red colouring pencil.    TaDa~

      I was flipping through my secondary school's year books not too long ago. Well, I was just removing the pressed dried sunflower petals out of the year books and i couldn't resist the temptation to peek into them. *LOL* Everyone was so cute back in secondary 1, all the baby fats are still intack. I even got Tara to flip throught her copy too... There was a xiao shuai ge, whom later on metamorphoses to a charming young lady. And also some alien looking fellow that went looking L.K.K. (Lao Kok Kok, meaning old) and looked lamer & lamer ever since... Everyone changed so much during those 4 years. There was never a year where by my hairstyle will look alike in those class photos, I guess that's what you call messy hair. Oh well...     And here's something that should not be forgotten:   HAPPY 39th BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!

      WHAT A WEEK!!!  I've been walking from Somerset MRT station to site after school for three weekdays, and walking along Singapore River to Clark Quay MRT station every day of those three days. How cool would it be to live there and waking up to take a little stroll along the river? So refreshing, so romantic, so nice &amp; so happening...  But this trips weren't just all play and no work. No no, instead we (Archi students) had to go around taking photos, measuring our site, taking note on existing services, storm the roof top and stuff (Ooppss.. I was told not to use "and stuff" during presentation, Haha.. heck!) all under the hot sun. Basically that's all I did for the whole week.  Busy week, routine for each day goes like this...  1) wake up 2) made my way to school 3) next to the sit(only 3 days) 4) and lastly home(done traveling) 5) look through lecture notes 6) watch TV, surf the web, chat on msn 7) work on data collected from site on A3 butter paper 8) wish everyone good nite..zzZZ 9) repeat 1-8  Nothing much which I can blog about except this. VAL!!! You almost got Tara to not talk to me anymore. Val, we're quits ok? Because I almost got nova not to talk to you.

      Went out in the evening to meet up with my classmate at the site to collect more data. This time around, I‚Äôm more prepared. HEhe‚Ä¶ I almost made a wrong turn into the Mistress Block, no I dun have a mistress there‚Ä¶ So stop thinking about it, it was merely a wrong turn. Since it was still early, I site at the Pulau Siagoon Brigde and did a tally on the vehicular and pedestrian movement around the site. Yeah, then my group mate showed up, and we went photo shooting. Before long it was night, the warehouse is super eerie especially after a light drizzle and the trees were ‚Äúcrying‚Äù constantly.  We met up with some of our classmates and made our way down to the nearest flats to take a distance view of our site. Then ‚ÄúBOOM BOOM BOOM~‚Äù goes the sky. It was the fireworks and we behind the flats climbing a super steep staircase. On hearing the banging & boomings from the fireworks, the girls dashed up the stairs like they were walking down them. They took a lift to the 12th floor of the closet flat without waiting for us guys, but Ha! They saw nothing but smoke. Server them right for not waiting for us to take the lift.  That flat wasn‚Äôt ideal to take photos of out site, thus we head for the nest block. ‚Ä¶.. T.B.C.
