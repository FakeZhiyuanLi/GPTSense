       I have a new phone now.  Yay!  It is a camera phone, too, so most likely I will be seeking your picture soon.  Why, you ask?  Well, then I can program it where whenever you call me, your happy picture will pop up and then I will push the ignore button.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.  *chuckle*  Anyhoo, the days to Honor's Choir dwindle down and I get more and more excited.  I can't wait to wear my dress for all to see!  *skips*  Oh, and singing too.  Yeah.  Haha.  I also can't wait to feel the power of singing in an amazing choir.  It has been a while since I have done that.  Today I got a haircut and I have bangs now!  Exciting, eh?  I think so.  They're not creepy uniform bangs though.  I like them and I think you will too.  At least, you will if you ever want me to talk to you again.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.

        -- Didn't you know, You are not allowed to speak of...*cough* school *cough*...during the summer time. There is no such thing. I proclaim your, "topic", nullified. Why even bring up such a thing....      Always,    Jacob

       So school is coming soon and we have no choice but to go back. Not that we wouldn't want to eventually go back, but that if it could be prolonged, I'm sure we all would gladly push it back. This school year isn't going to be bad or anything. It is just going to be very stressful, but at the same time  so much fun!  Parts of me will miss this past year. Being a junior was the most fun I've had... ever. So then, I guess we can assume that senior year will be all the better. Between Concert Choir, Show Choir, San Francisco, and Drama, not to mention all the numerous random fun activities there will be throughout the year, I don't think I have to worry about not having enough fun with all of you crazy fun people. So until the next post.   {Geoffrey}

Okay, I'm back.&nbsp; Now how may I help you?&nbsp; Oh, you would like a new topic eh?&nbsp; Okay... let me type that up on the computer here ((type sounds)).&nbsp; Ah yes, topics... hmm.&nbsp; Oh, here is a juicy one!&nbsp; School is starting up in less than a month.&nbsp; Is anyone out there ready?&nbsp; Believe me, I'm not.&nbsp; Bah college.&nbsp; Well, let me know what you think.&nbsp; And as always, have a terrific day!

       Yes, that is what I shall be. The Keeper of the Keys. *holds them high for everyone to see* INDEED. I decided that I like this blog because it let's me be ponderish, one of my favorite things to be, and then I get to see what people think without clicking on the comments button. Let's toast to that.   This is for my Katie: Will you be my warmie? *cheesy smile*   To everyone: Hey, I dare you to move.  Why is it that we spend so much time in&nbsp;a hurry to grow up but then when we finally get there we wish we could be young again? Is it because we wear diapers when we're small but once again when we're wrinkly? Why is it that I sit here, finally looking at my senior pictures, wondering where my life went? It seems as if these last few years have been on a&nbsp;slight fast forward and now it's only going to get faster. I wanted so badly to grow up, but now I find that I'm just a little bit scared to grow up the rest of the way. I hate to bring this up once again, but I find that it crosses my mind quite a bit lately, and I suppose I can't be the only one. I have officially finished my first senior thing and now I think I'm ready. I'm ready to actually classify myself as a senior. Indeed. Louisa Mae Soli-Holt&nbsp; has proclaimed herself a senior, one year away from starting her first year of college. I think I can handle that. I hope I can anyway. =)  This being the end of this post, good byes are in order. Look for a long survey on my blog...  urlLink www.jiggymae.blogspot.com  ...in the near future. Come to Coldstone on Thursday night and see me all dressed up. Smile a lot because it'll get you through the hard stuff and accentuate the best stuff. Remember that I love you. Because I do. Okay? Okay. =)  **Louisa**

       Wow, Chase, that's a very interesting question. It sounds fairly logical to me but, somehow, it doesn't. I think it mainly depends on the persons' attitude. I dhunno, really. I guess my answer is False. Good question! Bye!

       Hey all... I just wanted to run an idea past you guys.&nbsp; Would anyone be interested in coming to a party at my house in Brandon the Saturday before school starts?&nbsp; That would be the 28th of August.&nbsp; Umm... yeah... leave a comment or a post and let me know what you think and perhaps I will set it into motion.  --Ashley M.

         I think that the statement may be true and false at the same time.&nbsp; I agree for the most part with what Sean said.&nbsp; It's understandable that a person may be quiet around their friends and talkative with their loved one because the reason they are that person's loved one is because they feel they can be the most open and comfortable with them.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; But, as Sean so eloquently stated, it depends on the situation and who is around.&nbsp; Bottom line, sometimes people to crazy things and are entirely unpredictable and not able to be&nbsp;summed up in&nbsp;one sentence.&nbsp; So... Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is my quite possibly indecipherable standpoint.&nbsp;    --Ashley M. Ludewig--

       Well, in response to Katie's question: yes katie, I think it should be by the half&nbsp;year now. Because you have reached the point where a month is such a small percentage of your total relationship time. Plus, I don't like hearing about it  every single month . I am happy for you, but I think it may be a little more special if it is by the half year. Then, I will be able to say, "Wow, it's been a year and a half already? My, how time flies."   Done with that topic. Now to Chase's question: The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover.&nbsp; True or False?  Well, I agree, but then I don't. I believe that they act differently tho their loved one, but not necessarily all the time. Let's say a person is with  only  their loved one. Then, I agree with you. They will act kinder and sweeter and gentler. But, if the person is with their loved one  and  someone else is around too, they will act totally different. I dont' know if it is to impress their friend, but they say things and may even be cruel to their "loved one." Now, for some people it is the same when friend are around, but that is because they are not afraid to let their friends know how they feel or act towards their "loved one." I hope you understood. That is my experience in these things.

       I realize now that my post title would be a great name for a band.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;   Anyway, I am having trouble with my space bar this evening, as I am on our old downstairs computer.&nbsp; We call it Biwwy (retarded voice of "Billy") because it really does have the technological capabilities of a 76 year old that has recently had a labotomy.&nbsp; Anyway, after a long struggle to make the link work I have joined this blog.&nbsp; Good idea, by the way, my dear Geoffrey!&nbsp; I like the communal (right word?) aspect&nbsp;of this.&nbsp; A collaborative effort always turns out peachy in the end.&nbsp;   Okay, so today is Geoff and my year and two month anniversary.&nbsp; That sounds weird.&nbsp; I think we should count by half years at the most now.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Sounds like the right thing to do.&nbsp; Anyway, I must depart.&nbsp; I have summer school in the morning and it is already 1:35 A.M.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Ahhhh,&nbsp;a night in the life of Katie.&nbsp; Or any of you for that matter.&nbsp; We're all night owls...it must be something in the water.

       I really think clowns are stupid.&nbsp; To many colors all at once with those damn white faces!&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I really have never thought of them as creepy either... except Bozo the clown... he was kinda creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway...  New topic of discussion... a little deeper... a bit of philosophy.    The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover. &nbsp;   True or False?

       Haha Geoff!&nbsp; You entered the address for Chase's blog incorrectly (chasetiferspointofview.blogsot.com versus chastiferspointofview.blogs   P   ot.com) and it takes you to a site titled "Aaron's Bible University" or something like that.&nbsp; You might want to fix that dear.

       Well, I would have to say that clowns are&nbsp;funny and scary at the same time. I remember going to the circus and seeing clowns and going to the bathroom and crying the whole time I was at the circus.&nbsp; But, now, they don't bother me. In fact, my church has a group called "The Clowns of St. John." Basically, they go around to the hospitals and visit sick kids. So, in that perspective, clowns are good. But, who knows? Maybe it's just some big cover-up?

       No joking! I am scared to death of clowns. I went to a psychiatrist about it one time and he said that I have Coulrophobia, or the fear of clowns. I don't know why, but they have always frightened me.&nbsp;I think it's because they are constantly happy. No human I know is constantly happy so, therefore, I do not classify clowns as human. That's all I have to say about that. Farewell!

        True, true. Clowns and their habits are creepy, but who says you can't have fun with that? I mean, come on. Nikki Willhoit is creepy, yet we have fun with... I'm done. I personally don't have anything against clowns. Well... mostly. The one in "IT" is still a bit scary, but that's just because I was traumatized. The way I see it is that if it's creepy, poke it. Then, based upon its reaction, do it again, and again, and again. Then it'll just cry a lot. There, now it's not creepy anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; :P  &nbsp;   {Geoffrey}

       It honestly depends on the situation, but seeing as how they are usually played by toothless carnies trying to screw with little kids' minds I say they are creepy.&nbsp; Maybe not to the little kids, but to me they are.&nbsp; Plus there's almost never a girl clown so it's always just a bunch of guys doing stupid and sometimes randy things to one another.&nbsp; ... but that's just me.  --Ashley M.

        Another blog is created and another adventure is to begin. This blog could turn out to be a very exciting place. It could have crazy arguments and debates or it could have hilarious limericks posted by a few of those randier people. This should be an alltogether wonderful experience. I hope you all enjoy.    &nbsp;   {  Geoffrey}
