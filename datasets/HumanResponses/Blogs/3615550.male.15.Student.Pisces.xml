      Well, I’m back now, and some interesting things have happened since I left.  Why can’t things happen while I have internet access?  First of all, Bunnie Diehl has decided to  urlLink review  a mainstream song, called Slither  (by Velvet Revolver, I think).  I find the song, though not offensive, to be lyrically lacking (how do you like that alliteration?).  Take a gander over there to see the lyrics.  I find the completely non-sequitur lines of the song to be quite tiresome.  Second, I have several e-mails that I have to respond to.  Lately I have been doing a poor job of keeping up with my e-mail correspondences because of my blog, and that was compounded recently by the fact that my e-mail stopped working for a while.    Thirdly, the U.S. government has handed over power in Iraq two days early!  I will post on this as soon as I can.  For goodness sake, didn’t the government know that they should wait to hand over power until I can write a post?  ;)  This stuff is all great, except for the fact that I don’t have enough internet time to take care of all of it.  My parents installed some parental controls on our computer in order to limit my internet time, since we have broadband.  At press time, I had less than 5 minutes left on my clock, and I had to type the post offline (cutting and pasting to publish my post).    I will try to return to my regular posting schedule as soon as possible.  To get there, I have lots of work to do.      Be blessed! Neo

      My parents are going on a business trip for a few days, and I will be staying with my grandparents.  A lack of internet access there means that I will not be able to post anything until late Wednesday or Thursday.  I hope I don't go through blogger withdrawal... ;)  Be blessed!  Neo

      Here we go again! More  urlLink hostages !  I'm really getting sick of this now.  I mean it, this is becoming non-news.  I'd like to see a report where there actually *aren't* any hostages or beheadings.    But what's worse than the fact that this is becoming non-news is the fact that there are three men who are about to be beheaded by terrorists.  We see this so often now that it is pathetic, and my anger has turned into exasperation.  How much longer will these barbaric tactics be used before we get tough on those who use them?  The terrorists claimed that "(the prisoners) will receive the just punishment of being beheaded" if Turkey doesn't give in to the terrorists.  I can't help but wonder where the folks who decry the death penalty in America are right now.  Shouldn't they be leading the fight to apprehend these monsters?  Last time I checked, beheading wasn't generally considered a "just punishment," especially if the punishment is for something that has no connection with the person being punished.    The horror that I feel about these beheadings is becoming more widespread, however.  Unfortunately, anti-Muslim sentiment (of the violent kind) is * urlLink reported * to be rising.    While I am completely against the radical Muslims who terrorize our country and our world, I am not violent about it, and I disagree with those who are.  The following statement, however, just strikes me as loony:   "It's really our fear coming true," said Faiza Ali of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "It indicates a hatred that could turn into something violent."    Hmm, I wonder if the hatred he speaks of is anything like the hatred that has been attacking the Jews and Americans for years.  After all, that hatred turned violent long before 9-11.    The moderate Muslims, as they are called, need to speak out against the radicals, and they need to join the forefront of the fight against radical Islam in order to prove their goodwill.  Presently, those claiming to be moderates do little to turn in the radicals or to fight the radicals, but they then whine when they are suspected of sympathizing with or being terrorists.  This is typical abuse of freedom.  When Muslims behead an American, the Palestinians are filmed dancing in the streets, and the American Arabs hold memorial services-- not for the victim of Muslim agression, but for the victim of anti-Muslim violence.  The least these folks could do is remember Nick Berg as well, and speak out against terrorism of all kinds.   We live in some crazy times, and we are under siege.  No longer do our enemies plant themselves outside the borders of their enemies and fire inward; now they infiltrate the society and attack from the very heart of their enemy.  It is now hard to distinguish between friendly civilians and enemy terrorists; the terrorists try to blend in with their civilian counterparts and the friendly Muslims aren't very helpful in finding the terrorists, or even in proving that they aren't terrorists themselves.  Pre-emptive strikes on suspected terrorist strongholds both inside America and abroad are the only way to defeat our enemy.  There is no standing army to confront on the battlefield; the world is their battlefield.  Every nation, city and street is considered the battleground by this new enemy, and we were woefully unprepared to fight such an unscrupulous opponent.    We gave every person within our borders extensive rights to privacy and freedom to assemble and voice dissent, and this is how we are repayed.  The freedom that we have given, in hopes that it wouldn't be abused, and in hopes that in light of our obvious goodwill we would be viewed as benevolent and kind, has been used against us.  It would be stupid to send a knight into battle without his armor.  In the same way, we must make ourselves less vulnerable to these sneaky, vicious fiends who wish to use our liberty against us.  If this means a crackdown on the problem groups, so be it.  We have to trust the justice system to do all within its power to find out who is guilty and who is innocent.  The Muslims are proven to produce many terrorists.  The Muslims who aren't terrorists and aren't connected with terrorists might still be apprehended.  They could be tried.  Some may even be wrongly convicted, though I hope not.  They must view it as their duty to the country that, even while investigating its citizens, still allows more freedoms than most other countries would even think of.  Moderate Muslims must do all in their power to distance themselves from terrorism, so that they won't have to worry if they are accused.  It's a two way street; we can try to avoid unjustified arrests, but they have to make it easy to see when the arrests would be justified and when they wouldn't.  The radicals try their hardest to look like moderates, and thus the moderates must try their hardest to prove their innocence.    Terrorism causes trouble all around.  It hurts everyone from those killed in the terrorist action to the Muslims who claim peace but are constantly impersonated, thus making it impossible to tell the difference between the radicals and the moderates.  It sets off false alarms and keeps the population jumpy and on edge, and it circumvents the alarms to strike without warning.  Terrorism is without a doubt a great danger, and one that needs to be eradicated at all costs.    If a crackdown is necessary, I hope the moderates will prove their innocence and dedication to America by putting up with the necessary actions which will keep not only the non-Muslim population safe, but will also the Muslims living peacefully in America safe from terrorism.  Peace through strength is the only way.  The decades-old strategies of appeasement and containment have yielded no results, but peace through strength, the only logical alternative, has proven effective in its role in the downfall of the Soviet Union and the capture of Saddam Hussein.  Peace is great, but we must not shy away from it when it involves making a show of strength and using that strength to put down unruly members of society.  Fear will achieve no peace.  Be blessed, y'all. Neo

      I'm too nauseated to speak; just read  urlLink this  and tell me what you think.    New entries into the Neo's Adapted Political Dictionary, 1st ed.   Pride  (n., as in,  gay pride ) Definition:  Sense of invincibility resulting from the protection and encouragement of a politically correct culture.   Usage:  Gay  pride  demonstrators often spew insults at those who voice disagreement. Other forms: Prideful (adj.), pridefully (adv.).   Right  [or "rights"]  (n., as in,  homosexual rights  or  right to die ) Definition:  A privilege based solely on ability to commit an act, regardless of consequences; a wish for the privilege to commit immoral acts without fear of reproach by people of opposing viewpoints.

       urlLink U.N. Says Opium Production Is Rising .    So what are they going to do about it?  Are they going to try the Canada way out and try to force the legalization of opium?  Maybe the U.N. will condemn stuff.  They're good at that; it makes them feel like they are doing something good without that annoying obligation to take action.    Maybe they'll blame it on America; after all, we are the ones who invaded Afghanistan, and by freeing the people, we have given them more means to make the drug.  DOWN WITH AMERICA!  Really though, this is a big problem.  U.N. bashing aside, somebody really needs to take some action in Afghanistan, whether that someone is the U.S., the U.N., or somebody else.  Maybe they'll be able to work something out.  Finally, let's not forget what the article said about illegal drugs versus legal ones.  Abuse of any substance, legal or illegal, always leads to bad consequences, sometimes for the individual (such as lung cancer) and sometimes for society (such as a drunk-driving accident).    Let's be more careful with God's temple; let's present ourselves a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.  Once everyone starts doing that, alcoholics will want to change because they will no longer be the norm and socially acceptable.  That's the only way to guard against substance abuse.  Be blessed!

       urlLink Israeli Troops Kill Palestinian in West Bank .  So?  The soldiers were in danger, and they were trying to defend themselves.    I guarantee you that there will be renewed suicide bombings in retaliation of the Israeli "brutality."  I bet the U.N. will condemn Israel for this action, too.  Every nation in the world has a right to defend itself (and even use such means as terrorism) except America and Israel (and we wouldn't even think of terrorism).    The world shall despise us...

      I can't believe it!  urlLink A rapper has been accused of a crime !  I am shocked!  Come on, did anyone really think this wouldn't happen?  Practically every rapper out there has been arrested for drug related crimes, or at least has been involved in drug related crimes, and other crimes among rappers are not exactly a rarity.  Why do we let these creeps continue to influence the youth of America?  Let's just send our kids to visit a maximum-security prison and have them buddy up with some of the prisoners; then at least the rest of us wouldn't have to listen to their profane music.    These rappers steal, do drugs, murder, and delight in fornication, all the while they are singing about it and telling America's kids how great sin is.  What are the kids doing listening to that crap?  To borrow from Bunnie Diehl, I believe that rap (of the variety that I have just menioned) would definately qualify as "craptacular."  Actually, that's an understatement, considering that the term "craptacular" does not even take the sin or the glorification of sin into account.  The kids of America are horribly irresponsible.  That really gets on my nerves.  Unfortunately, the reason they are irresponsible is because their PARENTS are irresponsible.  Parents let their kids listen to such blatantly evil "music," watch horrible movies, and then put their kids on Prozac because they can't figure out what the problem is.  And don't even get me started on ADD...  When a Christian society and heritage collide with such anti-Christian values found in rap and many other areas of our culture, something's got to give.    To paraphrase: "All that is required for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing."    Be blessed, everyone.

      Hmm, so  urlLink Kerry Blames Bush for Partisanship in D.C.   I often wonder if Kerry actually knows what's going on.  Maybe he should campaign as the "ignorance is bliss" candidate, because that certainly seems to be his policy.  Let me give you some things he said about the senate:  "...in this Senate... it's my way or the highway, shut the door, lock the people out, don't let them take part in the democracy, don't respect the institution. Don't show the common courtesies that actually bring people together to find the common ground."  Hey, it sounds like he's talking about the constitutionally abusive filibusters!  Maybe he's actually in touch with the real world for once! Oh wait, he continued by saying this:  "So they found a way all day to twiddle their thumbs, do very little, attend a reception at the White House, but not let John Kerry vote."  (Sigh) Well, I'd say he's completely right; the senate does have a problem with locking people out and not letting them take part in democracy.  One of those people is Miguel Estrada.    "(The Republicans) Don't show the common courtesies that actually bring people together to find common ground."  Hey, at least the Repubs let the Democrats talk.  One can't even find that much courtesy in the Democrats' record.    In Kerry's world, the earth is still flat, the sun revolves around the earth, and everything revolves around Kerry.  In Kerry's world, we are in a worse situation economically than theSoviet Union, but instead of having a great humanitarian like Stalin as leader, we get stuck with a warmongering cowboy who is a complete wimp.  Again, that's in Kerry's world.    In the real world things are different.  If anyone wants to know what things are like in the real world, he must simply listen to what Kerry says... and then not believe a word of it.    The new JFK's view of the world is a paradox, an obvious contradiction to reality.  Therefore, when referring to something paradoxical or outright stupid that John Kerry says, it shall be called a Kerrydox.  It could also be called a Kerrymoron, but we will reserve that for references to Kerry himself.  Maybe if we all vote for Kerry, he can take us all to his alternate reality, where everything is wrong and he can fix it all.  That way, he would be a hero, at least in his own little world.  UPDATE:  I (yet again) posted the wrong link.  Now you should be able to visit the site that has the story I mentioned.

      According to  urlLink Reuters , a black housecat ran around impersonating a panther and scaring people in Marseille, France.  They actually had to call out the police force.  Do you mean to tell me that they couldn't even tell that the feline was just a little too small to be a panther?  I mean, sure, the cat was big, but to mistake it for a panther?  I'm glad we've got such smart folks like that in NATO to cover our backs.    They'll send out the police force to apprehend something that they *think* might be dangerous, but they won't send troops to apprehend someone they *know* is a brutal dictator.

      Lookee  urlLink here !  Kerry thinks the middle class is miserable.  Tell that the the growing economy.  I hope this story gets out; it would be huge for Bush and horrible for Kerry.  I think Kerry needs to run for president in a third world country, because he's campaigning like we are doing horrible and everyone is in poverty.  I don't think so.  Then again, I don't think I'd wish Kerry on anyone.

      In my last post, I said "don't feed the animals."  In case there was any doubt in your mind,  urlLink these  are the animals I was referring to, and they are truly animals.    I am enraged!  Another beheading!  It's time to hunt these troglodytes down and shoot them on sight!  They have been on an unchecked rampage for too long, and it's time to bring them down!  Maybe it seems a little harsh to shoot them on sight.  You must remember, though, that we are in a war, and in war, you don't ask your enemy kindly for permission to shoot him.  If we capture these neanderthals, they will just be put on trial, and they almost certainly won't get the death penalty.  Leniency won't win the hearts and minds of a people who view leniency as a weakness.    It has been said that we should follow the rules of war even when fighting against an enemy with no regard for such rules.  While there is a lot to be said for that, I say we shoot the pigs who behead civilians.  No trial, nothing.  After all, they have fought for their whole lives against the system that would put them on trial, and since they don't want to be under that system, let's let them have their wish.  No need for them to be under our laws, since they don't like our laws anyway.  Let's just get rid of them.  That may seem harsh.  It probably is.  However, I am fed up with the beheadings and terrorism.  I have had enough.  These evil dogs don't deserve to live or be given a fair trial.  In my angry screed, let's not forget that Jesus loves even these individuals.  They need to be saved.  Truth is, though, that God meant for people to be punished when they kill their fellow man.  Of the seven things God hates, one of them is hands that shed innocent blood.  These men have done that, and they deserve to pay for that.    I am not God.  I cannot and will not exact punishment on the radical Muslims who behead people.  The government can, and should exact that punishment.  Unruly members of society, those who pose a great an imminent danger to their peers, must be removed from society through either incarceration or execution.    If these men are found, I imagine they will be captured (assuming they don't fight to the death).  In that case, they will probably receive a proper trial and be put in jail.  I guess that works, so long as they are never released.    In my opinion, if we are going to punish our soldiers for humiliating (and allegedly murdering, though I haven't heard of that being conclusively proven) detainees, we should also punish our enemies, the terrorists, for beheading our citizens.    Law must prevail.  The sexual immorality of our guards at Abu Ghraib was disgusting.  Punish them for it.  The terrorists have beheaded our civilians.  Punish them for it.  Our guards are under our laws, and they should be punished accordingly.  The terrorists hate our law and don't want to be under it.  They must be punished, but the question is how?  I imagine the best way would be to try them under our law anyway.    Shooting the terrorists on sight may not be the best policy.  Then again, it may be.  I spoke hastily and I honestly don't know what the best punishment is in this situation.  That's not for me to decide.  God put the burden of punishment on the government, not me.  The best thing I can do is pray that God will guide those in authority and help them know what to do.

      I'm about to make a statement that may shock and outrage some people.  It could be interpreted as bigoted, hateful, and uncaring.  It might even be considered (shudder) politically incorrect.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT ABU GHRAIB!  Ahh, that feels better.    Here's the truth:  The liberals in America got wind of the "torture" (read: embarrassment) of some prisoners in Iraq and decided that Rumsfeld should resign.  After all, he was the one who was torturing those poor men, right?  Good grief!  We embarrassed some enemies while they were our POWs, and it's being treated like we beheaded every last one of them.  Why?  The Dems say it's because "we aren't winning their hearts and minds with this kind of behavior."  For Pete's sake, there is *no way* to win their hearts and minds.  They have been taught from childhood that America is the "Great Satan" because it supports Israel, and that America must be defeated.  Each time we try to be nice to them, each time we go out of our way to make sure they understand our goodwill, they only repay us with terrorism.  They won't understand kindness, because they view that as weakness.    I feel that the liberals in America tend to hold a double standard in war.  They want to put our soldiers on trial for embarrassing a few prisoners, while they are saying nothing about the Iraqi guards who repeatedly raped and beat their prisoners.  The liberals call it bigotry when someone refers to the Muslim world as "backward" and "uncivilized," claiming that we should treat them like a highly civilized people capable of democracy even though the Muslims have never experienced democracy and haven't the slightest clue of how it works.  Amid their exaltations of the obviously morally superior radical Muslims (they never invaded another country unilaterally, right?), they call on the U.S. to treat the prisoners like dignitaries, complete with banquets and caviar.    That's stupid.  First they argue that the Muslims are just as advanced in their knowledge as we are, and then they tell us that the Muslims should be allowed using barbaric means such as terrorism (i.e., in Israel) because they are backward and that is the only means available to them.  Then they argue that we should treat the barbarian radicals even more kindly than we treat prisoners from our own country.    I know that seems like horrible logic, and that's because it is.  Lest you think that I'm living in a dream world and that even the liberals wouldn't use such faulty arguments, I must tell you that I have been in arguments where those arguments were all used.  Liberals generally have somewhat differing opinions, just as conservatives do, and therefore the arguments I have mentioned don't apply to all liberals, but I have seen that they do use such erroneous reasoning.  Allow me to say that I am not actually bigoted.  Not all Muslims are "barbarians."  However, the Wahabi and Shiite sects are both radical and militant, and they, along with other militant sects, make up a large part of the Muslim population.  Militant and radical Muslims are barbarians; I stand by that and I won't recant.  Remember the people who danced in the streets in Palestine on 9/11? They were barbarians.  Remember the guerillas who try to blow up our soldiers?  They are barbarians.  If we capture them, we should not interrogate them over crumpets and tea.  We should intimidate them and scare the crap out of them until they talk.  Pump some Truth Serum into them, for goodness' sake.  If our enemies won't abide by the rules of war, we shouldn't feel obligated to abide by them either when dealing with such animals.  I won't condone the sexual perversion of the Abu Ghraib incident.  It was sinful.  However, the outrage over the whole thing is completely overblown.  Nick Berg was beheaded, not embarrassed, and none of his captors were worried about winning the hearts and minds of Americans.  I have seen much more coverage of Abu Ghraib than of Nick Berg, and personally, I would rather the media not try to mislead me into thinking that we are the bad guys by covering our mistakes more than our enemy's intentional and planned atrocities.  We are fighting a new kind of enemy in this war; the kind that has no conscience and will do anything for the sake of Allah (and perhaps the 70 virgins he thinks he will get upon death).  These animals (people, whatever) cannot be won to our side because they have already made up their minds for Allah.    The Radical Muslims will only understand a show of force, just like disobedient little kids.  Children will not stop disobedient activity if they are offered candy.  They will only intensify their disobedience because they see the result of their actions is something good.  Humans tend to associate actions with their consequences.  If an action brings about something good, we consider the action good.  This goes back to the "sowing and reaping" principle; we know that we reap things of the same character of that which we sowed.  The radicals see themselves blowing up and beheading Americans, and then they see their prisoners being released.  Since they want more prisoners released, can you guess what they are going to do?  As the saying goes, "Don't feed the animals."  We must wake up and take a good whiff of reality.  Our enemies must be defeated, and the only way to achieve that is through force.  It's pretty sad when a country like America's bark is worse than its bite, but when we can't even bark like we're tough, it spells doom.  Peace (through strength), Y'all.

      Over on  urlLink Bunnie Diehl's blog  there is a perpetual argument about CCM, Praise and Worship music, and other such points.  Every week, Bunnie "reviews" one of the top 20 CCM songs, and proceeds to bash it indiscriminately.  She has thus far bashed  More  (Matthew West),  Glory Defined  (Building 429),  Dare You To Move  (Switchfoot),  Who Am I  (Casting Crowns),  Instead  (Stacie Orrico),  Grace Like Rain  (Todd Agnew), and  Ready to Fly  (FFH).  The only song that Bunnie gave a passing grade to was  Sea of Faces , by Kutless.  You see, that song mentions the sacraments, and therefore it is Christian.   Who Am I , however, had too many cliches for Bunnie.  Sheesh.  Bunnie has also posted screeds against P&W, or Praise and Worship music.  Apparently she believes it to be uncreative, and finds the old hymns to be far more worshipful.  For some reason, she seems to believe that God does not deserve even the amount of praise that we give our favorite football player when he scores a touchdown.  Bunnie believes that we must be solemn (she must have missed the story in the Bible about David's dancing before God).    Maybe Bunnie needs to read  urlLink this article . Julie Anne Fidler shares her views on the Praise and Worship movement, and is nice about it.  She also challenges those of us who bear grudges against old hymns to "reevaluate your stance on what is worship..."  After all, worship is not in the music, but in the heart of the worshipper.  Thanks to  urlLink Sara  for the heads up on  urlLink CMCentral .

      It's quite late right now, and I have nothing to do.  Therefore, I am simply going to post something.  I suppose I will just talk about what I'm doing and thinking.  I'm listening to Matthew West's  More  on the radio.  I just LOVE this song.  The chorus goes:  I love you more than the sun and the stars  that I taught how to shine  you are mine and you shine for me too I love you  yesterday and today and tomorrow I'll sing it again and again I love you more  For some reason, that song just seems so wonderful to me.  God's love is so great, even though we have done nothing to deserve it.  He made so many immense and powerful objects in His creation, such as the sun and the stars, yet, out of all of Creation, we are the only things to which He gave souls.  He wants to spend eternity with us, and I, not being able to completely grasp the concept of His love, can't possibly figure out why.    Now FFH's  One of These Days  is on the radio.  I haven't listened to this song in a while, but man, I love the lyrics.  It talks about when we get to heaven, and all the things we will do there.  Here's the chorus:  One of these days I'm gonna see the hand that took the nails for me One of these days I'm gonna hold the key to the mansion built for me One of these days I'm gonna walk the streets of gold that were paved for me One of these days I'm gonna see my Savior face to face One of these days  I really like this song.  Its content reminds me somewhat of the newer song  I Can Only Imagine .  Heaven's gonna be awesome, I can't wait until I get there.  Until then, I guess I will just focus on getting to know God and trying to make the world a better place.

      Hey everybody!  It's me, Neo.    Okay, so now that I'm back, I am going to be doing something a little differently on my blog.  It has occurred to me that as the administrator of this blog, I really shouldn't be posting so many comments.  The posts are my voice; I should leave the comments to be yours.    This applies mainly to the political posts.  As more people visit this blog, there are bound to be disagreements, and I should not hijack the comments threads.  Instead, I want you guys to duke it out.  If you disagree with someone, tell them so on the comments page, and tell them why.  Please be respectful, of course, so as to foster a good debate, but don't be afraid to disagree.  Just wondering, do you guys have any suggestions for my blog?  I'm still working to improve it however I can, and your input would be quite welcome.  Be blessed! Neo

      I just got this week's issue of WORLD Magazine, and the front page as well as two articles are devoted to Ronald Reagan.  And rightly so.  I'm one of those people who is all for putting Reagan's likeness on Mount Rushmore.  The way I see it, Reagan has done more for our country than any other president in history.  Washington did a great job leading our fledgling nation, Lincoln held us together during a civil war, and Eisenhower was just great all around, but besides them, none of our other presidents can hold a candle to Reagan.    Reagan dared to challenge the Soviet Union and he won.  Because of Reagan, millions of people can live free, without the fear of Communism always in the back of their minds.  Because of Reagan, the Berlin Wall, the symbol of the Iron Curtain, fell and thus became a symbol of capitalism and democracy.  Because of Reagan, I don't have to fear Soviet missiles being aimed at my country.  I very much regret not having been alive during Reagan's presidency.  It must have been so exciting to be an American during that time!  Now, however, I have a new conservative president to watch.  President George W. Bush faces a threat that is comparable to that of the Soviet Union; the threat of radical Islam.  The radical Muslims are every bit as bent on the destruction of America as the Soviets were, and the Muslims have religion to fuel them.  I pray that President Bush will have the courage to stand alone in the international community and say "Enough!  No more suicide bombings!  No more genocide! No more oppression of other religions!"  Peace through strength is a trademark of great leaders, and I pray that President Bush will not bow to pressure from arrogant France, or from other nations that, because they are so mired in pluralism, can't even see the danger that is right in front of their face.  These nations have kept their mind so open that it fell out, and idiots in high places can have disastrous consequences.   The jury is still out on George W. Bush.  He hopefully has four more years in which he can either live up to Reagan's standard, or fail to do so.  May God grant him the courage and strength to lead with excellence.

      The Associated Press reports on  urlLink Yahoo News  that french fries, obviously a cooked food, are now classified as "fresh vegetables."  This does not mean, however, that you now need 3-5 servings of french fries as the food pyramid would suggest.  Rather, the classification is actually for commercial reasons only.  So why would I even post this mundane story?  Because the Agriculture Department said that it does not consider an order of french fries the same as an apple in school lunches.  Okay, so my only reason for posting this story is this:  Does the Agriculture Department actually think that an apple is a fresh vegetable?

Actually, I have several friends who are going on this mission trip, but one is, shall we say, more notable than the others.  When she gets back, I will try to post some information about her experiences on the trip, and possibly some info from my other friends who went on said trip.  Until then, I will be praying for their safe trip and return.  More later...

      OH MY GOSH!  I didn't think the Supreme Legislature (formerly known as the Supreme Court) would ever again render a constitutional decision.  It appears, however, that law and order have for once prevailed.  The Supreme Court today ruled that the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance are constitutional--well, sort of.  The man who started this case, Michael Newdow, claimed that his daughter (a Christian, no less) should not have to say the Pledge of Allegiance since he perceived the words "under God" to be a government endorsement of religion (Oh, the horror!).  Anyway, Mr. Newdow only has partial custody of his daughter, and the girl and her mother like the pledge the way it is.  Because of Mr. Newdow's lack of custody (he only sees his daughter 10 days a month), the Supreme Court ruled that he has no standing to speak for his daughter.  Said Michael Newdow: "I may be the best father in the world," adding "She spends 10 days a month with me. The suggestion that I don't have sufficient custody is just incredible. This is such a blow for parental rights."   No, actually it's a blow to the rights of people who try to change the meaning of the Constitution without using the voting process.  Mr. Newdow, if we wanted you to make our laws for us, we would have elected you to public office.  This is a democracy, my friend, and in a democracy, all the people make the laws, not just one insane athiest who thinks he is infallible.  If you want that, you can move to Cuba.

       urlLink Yahoo! News reports  that the perverted HBO series "Sex and the City" will be released to basic cable this summer.  Fear not, however, for it will be sanitized, or so they say.    From the Yahoo! report:    "TBS is promoting 'five nights of great sex,' and will air two of the series' best episodes each evening through Saturday, starting at 10 p.m. EDT. The network will begin showing all 94 episodes this summer, in order from the first to the last."  Is it really possible to sanitize something that is utter filth?  For example, have you ever heard of anyone who said "I'm going to clean my dirt now."  Of course not!  If someone sanitizes "Sex And the City" correctly, there will be nothing left.  That would be a good thing, but the very fact that the series is going to air is proof that it hasn't been sanitized enough.    Good thing it's going on TBS; I imagine its moral depravity won't be too big of a stretch for that station.  Rather, it should be almost par for the course.

      Ahh, don't you just love the smell of a fresh blog? It's quite invigorating. Or, maybe I just need to get some sleep.  Hi, I'm NeoFascist?, and this is my own personal blog. I plan to bring you news, viewpoints, and the occasional random thought to get you thinking as well.   For my first post, I figure I had better explain my name. Many people understand it, but a few tend to mistake satire for being literal. My name, NeoFascist? (with a question mark), is intended to save the breath of the liberals who use the term carelessly and endlessly. If any person who holds conservative beliefs is to be labeled a fascist by the liberals (a sign that they have never read a history book), then why don't we just call ourselves that in order to save the liberals the trouble? I am not, repeat, AM NOT, a fascist, but rather a conservative teenager who is sick of the idiocy which surrounds him.  In my blog I will try to document news for group discussions on the comments page. I will also add my personal viewpoints on and critiques of our broken society. Please be patient as I learn the finer points of blogging, and by all means, leave a comment; let me know you were here. Vulgar or obscene comments, however, will be edited and the right to post comments can be taken away at my discretion. Debate is healthy and fun, but obscene language is counter-productive to healthy debate.  I will try to post my first news item shortly.   Be blessed!  Neo

      Now this is great: Scientists have discovered a  urlLink shark repellent !  It is made from the extracts of dead sharks, but more research is needed to find the actual repellent molecule. Dead sharks have been known to repel live sharks for a long time, but now there is a repellent called A-2 that is being studied. It is so powerful that it can even repel sharks in a feeding frenzy. So far, "Tests have found the repellent effective on four species: the Caribbean reef, blacknose, nurse and lemon sharks."  I really hope that this receives adequate research and a product is distributed as soon as possible. I feel a little put out that the scientists want to protect the sharks first. Forget saving the humans with this product, let's work on a way to save sharks with it. Sheesh. That's for another post though...

       Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, it is not puffed up;  Does not behave itself rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth… Love never fails.   This is how the Bible describes love in 1 Corinthians chapter 13. This is the love that we as Christians must show. To show this love shouldn’t be hard for us, since we are Christians and as such we have the perfect example of love. God is our Father, and God is love. We are negligent to not reflect his love on Creation, since not only has he demonstrated his love to us by loving us unconditionally, but he has also written out a description of the love that we are to show. We have no excuse for not being imitators of Christ, except for our own pride and laziness. Let’s take a look at the characteristics of love.   “Love suffers long and is kind…is not provoked, thinks no evil (takes no account of the evil done to it)…”   Basically, this part of the Scripture calls upon us to be patient and kind. Easier said than done, but easily done when one knows who he is in Christ. Patience and kindness are crucial parts of one’s Christian witness; they show that one not self-centered, which gives the person more influence over those around him. Someone who exhibits patience and kindness always has a more willing audience than someone who is constantly focused on himself and what affects him. The phrase “thinks no evil” means “takes no account of the evil done to it.” This means that one who exhibits Christ’s love does not seek revenge against those who wrong him. Of course, we are not supposed to be doormats, but vengeance is the Lord’s, and the Lord’s alone. When we are wronged, we must submit ourselves to God. Believe it or not, to attempt to take vengeance into our own hands is to remove our faith from God. By attempting to get even, we are basically telling God that we don’t trust Him to take care of the injustice, and that we’d rather do things ourselves. We must cast our cares upon the Lord, and place our faith in Him to make things right.   “Love does not envy…does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in truth…”   Someone who has the love of Christ does not get upset because someone has something that he wants. Instead, a loving person rejoices for the blessings of another. A loving person will also not rejoice because of another’s misfortune. We are supposed to love and pray for our enemies, and that leaves no room for rejoicing over someone’s iniquity. To love even one’s enemy again improves one’s witness; if you continue to show love to your enemy for long, giving love in return for hate, then your enemy won’t be your enemy for long. Instead of rejoicing every time misfortune befalls your enemy and thus lowering yourself to his level, show the compassion you would show anyone. People will wonder what you’ve got going for you that even being shown hatred doesn’t affect you negatively and doesn’t change your attitude. To love a lovable person or a friend is simple; to love an enemy is a sign of a mature Christian.   “…love does not parade itself, it is not puffed up; does not behave itself rudely, does not seek its own…”   These things are further proof that love is not selfish. Love is naturally directed toward others. To always concentrate on oneself, or to be puffed up and seek one’s own, are indications that the love of Christ is not present. Christ never paraded himself, puffed himself up, behaved rudely, or sought his own (looked after only His own interests). Instead, He spent his time helping others and teaching them, being the perfect example of love. When we imitate Christ, others will be drawn to us because they know that associating with us will bring benefits.    “Love never fails.”   Real love, the love of Christ, does not fail. When it seems difficult to love, Christ’s love prevails when all other love falters. One with Christ’s love will continue to love even when other love has already withdrawn and turned to selfishness.   People are like bugs: They are always drawn toward the light. We as Christians are to be a light unto the world, and the best way to do that is to imitate the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Jesus was a shining light to the world, and we are to be like Him. In order to evangelize the world, we must have the knowledge to do so, but if we don’t have love, our evangelical ability is shot. If no one will listen to us, we have no chance of reaching them, and they will only listen to us if we prove that we’re worth listening to. If we show that we’ve got something that they need, they will listen. If we don’t show love, then we are no better than the world.

      I am shocked!&nbsp; Okay, so I'm not actually shocked.&nbsp; Really, I'm not surprised in the least.&nbsp; I'm even a little happy that the liberals' true colors have started to  urlLink show through .   Good grief, and the liberals call us hypocrites!&nbsp; They say that we are fighting a war because of a grudge or over oil, but they are willing to fight simply because they disagree with someone.&nbsp; I can just see their signs:    End Violence:&nbsp; Kill the Republicans!    Hypocrisy runs rampant on the Left, but rarely does anyone hear about it.&nbsp; The Left fights for free speech as well--free speech for all who agree with them.&nbsp; They say that everyone should be tolerant, but they forget to tolerate those&nbsp;that they perceive to be intolerant.&nbsp;   They say our children should be better educated, while they attack school vouchers and homeschooling, the best hopes for educating America's children.   They claim to be a party that defends the freedom of the average person, or the little guy.&nbsp; They neglect to defend, and they even oppress, the freedoms of the littlest guys of all.&nbsp; The Left keeps the destitute in bondage, and supports the oppression of citizens in totalitarian countries.&nbsp;   The left is all about freedom, but it neglects to spread the freedom around.&nbsp; They want freedom--for themselves!&nbsp; Should the Left achieve its goals, it would closely resemble--no, it would  be  the Dictatorship of the Proletariat which Karl Marx prescribed in his  Communist Manifesto  and furthermore, that would be their end goal.&nbsp; The Leftists fight for the exact same things that the Socialists fight for; if you don't believe me, compare the goals of the Socialists and the Liberals!&nbsp; Central to both systems is the philosophy of secular humanism.&nbsp; The stated goals of the Socialists and the implied goals of the Liberals are exactly the same.&nbsp; If they have the same structure, secular humanism, they will never be different.   Liberalism is built on denial and paradox.&nbsp; Liberals say "Freedom for all--all of us Leftists," and "We are tolerant of everyone--but you."&nbsp; They claim to be a&nbsp;straightforward philosophy of inclusion, but they are really a philosophy of fine print and exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are a philosophy of deception.&nbsp; They know that they would have no supporters if they said "We fight for our own benefit and no one else's."&nbsp; Therefore, they say " We fight for everyone's benefit.   Some restrictions apply  ."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   They claim that Conservatism is exclusionary and selfish because Conservatism fights for people based on the assumption of each person's inherent worth and right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&nbsp; Conservatives say that everyone has rights that can be improved or lost, based on behavior, and the accountability-hating Liberals find this offensive.&nbsp;     Lie-beralism has a faulty base.&nbsp; Secular humanism is a philosophy that can never work.&nbsp; Such a system as Liberalism can never stand if it adheres to its own principals because it's principals are destructive.&nbsp; Liberalism self-destructs and it attempts to counter this by convincing itself and others that it actually stands for more wholesome values.&nbsp; Saying that it stands for freedom sounds better than saying that it stands for freedom to sin.&nbsp; By changing the definitions of key words, the Lie-berals make their atrocious system of values more palatable to the average person.&nbsp;     Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind:&nbsp; Liberalism is a faulty system.&nbsp; Secular humanism, the foundation of Liberalism, is fallacious in its assumptions and tenets, and thus provides a warped base for the "free and inclusive" system of Liberalism.&nbsp; Should America adhere to these false tenets and place itself upon the warped base of Secular Humanism, America would surely fall, for if America seeks to imitate a self-destructive system, America would inevitably self-destruct as well.    Peace (through strength), y'all.    Neo

      I’m listening to WOW 1998. Right now it’s on a song called “We Need Jesus,” by Petra. I like it a lot.  We Need Jesus (Petra)    Verse 1:     When will the world See that we need Jesus? If we open our eyes We will all realize That He loves us When will the world See that we need Jesus? When our hearts are as one And believe that He’s the Son of our God   Chorus:     The Lord is our God And we shall never want The Lord is our God And we shall live forever When we share the love of Jesus See each other as He sees us Then His love will see us through His love will see us through   Verse 2:     When will the world See that we need Jesus? When sister and brother Love one another as one When will the world See that we need Jesus? Will we ever understand Jesus is the Son of man? We must live in the shadow of His love  Okay, so it’s a really simple song, but it’s awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;I especially liked the verse that talks about sister and brother loving one another. Recently, Laura mentioned how life would be so much easier for everyone if we just learned how to show a little love and compassion. After all, as Christians, we are to be imitators of Christ, and Christ was God incarnated. Now if Christ is God and God is love, and we are supposed to be imitators of Christ, what the heck are we doing acting just like the cruel world? Come on, folks! A little humility and compassion goes a long way.  Unfortunately, many Christians are too prideful to give up their old ways. They hang on to their sin nature and seek revenge on all who do them wrong. We are all guilty of being like that, but it seems that we as Christians have in general stopped being simply “in” the world and started to become “of” the world. We have lost our positive influence in the world because we have lost everything that has made our influence positive. We no longer take the time to be a cut above the world and we instead make our beliefs appear less appealing than the pointless, superficial, hopeless belief systems that the world has to offer. Go listen to “If We Are the Body” by Casting Crowns; this song very well illustrates the problems with being “of” the world and of forgetting to show love.   We’ve got to start showing more love; we’ve got to start proving that there is a reason to be a Christian and a higher calling on our lives! We can’t do that if we are so wrapped up in ourselves that we don’t reflect God and his unfailing love to humanity! Personally, I’m a big fan of random acts of kindness. Unfortunately we have done such a poor job of teaching those of our own faith how to be kind that we have no hope of rubbing off on non-Christians.   We are Christians. We are supposed to be imitators of Christ. Christ is God. God is love.   Any questions?   &nbsp; Be blessed! Neo

      Hey, hey, hey!&nbsp; I'm back!  Well, I made it to the first place we are going to stay for more than just one night.&nbsp; We're staying at--Get this,  urlLink Laura -- at the Penn Stater!&nbsp; Haha!  I'll be staying here for a couple of days, and then we'll be off to New Jersey for three days.&nbsp; This is really a business trip, but my dad decided to bring us along and make the trip into a vacation of sorts.&nbsp;   We stopped by Gettysburg on our way here, and it was quite interesting.&nbsp; We took a bus tour, and I had never realized just what went on at Gettysburg.&nbsp; Sure, I had read some stuff, but I was able to see just how the battle went with the tour and an electric map presentation of sorts.&nbsp; I'll post the pictures soon.  Anyway, I thought I'd let you know what's up.&nbsp; I have been typing all sorts of things on the laptop while we were driving, and I'll try to post some of it.&nbsp; I should be staying in the hotel room for most of today and tomorrow, so maybe I can get my cyberlife caught up in that time.  Be blessed! Neo

      Not much time right now, but I thought I'd let you know what was going on.&nbsp; I'm staying at the Four Points Sheraton&nbsp;Hotel in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; This hotel actually has Wi-Fi high speed internet access, so I can now post some of the stuff I have been writing over this long trip.   We are almost to the place that we are going to be staying for a couple of days, but for now we are only staying in one place for the night.&nbsp; Once I get to The Penn Stater (the hotel we made reservations at), I will be able to post some more entries and visit other people's blogs.&nbsp;   I have some pictures I want to post, but I'm not sure about how I'm going to do that.&nbsp; I downloaded Picasa, but I realized too late that Hello Bloggerbot requires Instant Messaging, which I don't have.&nbsp; I'm looking into getting Flickr, but we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out.&nbsp; Until then, just be happy that you have more posts to read.   We’ve driven 476&nbsp;miles since this morning, which means we only have about 200 miles to go tomorrow.&nbsp; We have been in five states today: Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and now Pennsylvania. While we were in&nbsp;West Virginia stopping for gas,&nbsp;we witnessed a traffic accident.&nbsp; A minivan collided with a small car, and the accident looked bad, since there was a lot of smoke coming from the minivan (I couldn't see the car).&nbsp; Besides that, today's drive has been uneventful.   Well, I must get going if I am going to figure out how to post pictures.   Be blessed! Neo

       Originally typed at 6:10 on Sunday, July 25.    Hello again! Time for another update!   I am presently on Highway 81 North, coming up on Harrisonburg, Virginia. We stopped in Roanoke to eat lunch, at a place called Famous Anthony‘s. I didn’t mind it too much until the waitress brought me a little kid drink, complete with a lid. Now, I don’t look that young--most people actually think I’m older than I am--but this waitress, or whatever reason, brought me a kids drink. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, and I could have sworn that I was eating grilled cardboard jerky. However, Famous Anthony redeemed himself with some excellent hot wings. I hate most spicy food, but these hot wings were just right.   From there we traveled to Natural Bridge, Virginia to see the--you guessed it, the natural bridge. It was very interesting to learn about it. It was originally owned by “the English crownhead, deeded to Thomas Jefferson, surveyed by George Washington, visited by John Marshall, James Monroe, Henry Clay, Samuel Houston, Daniel Boone, and others…” It was quite large, and there was more stuff there besides just the natural bridge, but we only visited the Indian village, fish pond, and natural bridge. It was a nice detour. I took a few pictures…   And now, as I type, we are on the road to our next overnight stay, Gettysburg. I am having to endure my brother’s joke reading, and it is very distracting to do so while I type. Here’s his favorite joke:   PRIZE FIGHTER’S SON: My dad is stronger than yours!   TRAFFIC COP’S SON: Oh yeah? My dad can hold up a line of cars with one hand!   So there you have it. His favorite joke. Now you can do some sort of a happy dance.   Hmm…what else do I have to talk about? We ate at Cracker Barrel for breakfast today, which means that we ate two meals in a row at the same Cracker Barrel (we ate there for supper last night). The power inverter that we had in the car gave out on us, making it to where I couldn’t type on my laptop for a while. We had to stop a K-mart and get a new converter, and we got one with two outlets so I can type and charge a digital camera at the same time.   My dad says we are now five hundred fifty-five miles from home right now. This is quite far away. I am already farther north than I have ever been, and the farthest away from home that I have ever been was Oklahoma. I am officially in unknown territory.   My laptop is about to run out of power. I can’t plug it in because we are charging two batteries, and the inverter only has two outlets. I can’t wait until I get to a hotel with broadband so I can post everything and send all of my e-mails. Anyway, that’s all I have to say for now.    &nbsp;  Be blessed!  Neo

       This post was finished at about 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 24, while on the road to Pennsylvania   Howdy everybody! Just thought I’d pop by and say hi! I’m presently on the road in easily the best traveling conditions I have ever encountered. I brought along my laptop so I can type stuff as I think of it, and since I can plug it in to a special outlet in the back of the van, I’m quite content. I brought along my CDs, so my brother can listen to music from the laptop while I type. Meanwhile, my parents are enjoying the peace and quiet.   If I get bored with this, I can practice piano on my keyboard that I brought along (also with headphones). It’s pretty small (only four octaves), so it should fit, though I’m not sure if it will because I haven’t used it yet. I also brought along some reading material (WORLD Magazine and Let Freedom Ring by Sean Hannity) in case I needed more still to occupy me. I had to return Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville before I finished reading it, but I will finish it. It is quite deep reading, and by far the most difficult reading I have ever attempted. Still, I am confident that I can conquer it.  I guess I’ll take this opportunity to tell you about my reading list. First, we have the aforementioned Democracy in America. For those of you who don’t know, it was written by a Frenchman who was visiting America in order to study the country. France had just been through a revolution, and Tocqueville wanted to study the pros and cons of democracy, or majority rule. It is a very interesting book; a must read for the well educated person, I’ve been told.  The next book on my reading list is Evidence That Demands a Verdict, a book that was recommended to me as a result of my questions about the inspiration of the Bible. My main question is if we, when we believe in the verbal-plenary inspiration of the men who wrote the Bible, are also believing in the inspiration of the men who compiled the Bible. My question has basically been answered (we also believe that those who compiled the Bible were inspired by God), but it has been recommended that I read the book so that I can know how to intelligently answer any questions on the subject.   I also plan on reading Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. For a total change of pace, a fiction book called Timeline has been recommended to me as well. Have any of you read it?  This seems like a good stopping point for the first of my road trip posts.    &nbsp;  Be blessed! Neo&nbsp;

      Well, I'm in the process of leaving for Pennsylvania now.  We should have actually left hours ago, but we are running late and will be leaving shortly.    My blog publishing problems haven't yet been fixed, but I have e-mailed Blogger Support and I am awaiting a reply.  The problem appears to lie in the fact that I am using Window's ME.    I will be gone for about a week and a half, but don't fear.  I think we are staying in some hotels with Wi-Fi, so I will be able to post there.  Also, I will be using my laptop, so I can post just like I used to.    I am going to use the massive amount of time in the car to type e-mails on the laptop, for I am hopelessly behind in that area.  I will also try to write some posts.  I am taking a digital camera with me, so maybe I will be able to post some pictures.  This is my first expedition into the Northern Unknown, so wish me luck.    I hope I've packed everything I'll need.  I, being a perfectionist, get a strange sort of complex every time I have to pack, because I am always sure that I forgot to pack something.  Hopefully reality will dispell my anxieties.    And with that, my friends, I must bid you farewell.  Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Fear not, however, for I shall return soon.  Until then, may God bless you abundantly beyond anything you could ever ask for.  Oh, and don't forget to visit the blogs on my blogroll, and get over there and visit David Sessions's blog!    Farewell!   Rides off into the sunset...    Realizes that he's supposed to be heading towards Pennsylvania, so he turns and heads the right direction.    Slams into a tree...    Regains consciousness, moves around tree, and rides off to Pennsylvania.

      Or it could just be a sorry PC.  I am typing this on Mozilla Firefox, and nothing has changed on my publishing page.  I am using Window's ME (have I mentioned that yet?), and even though I have switched browsers, I still don't have any formatting buttons.  I'm not a big fan of this Firefox stuff either; it seems a little slow.    I deleted all of my cookies, so there's nothing wrong there.  Life's just hard.  I will continue to look for a way to fix my publishing problems, so maybe I can get back to being the Neo that you know and love.  Expect a new post from me soon, as I am currently working on a post that doesn't involve any links.  I will also look for ways to work around my lack of publishing buttons, as well as possible ways to fix my problem.  Let's start by seeing if my scant HTML lingo is still usable:   TEST    TEST   Uh, yeah; that's all I can remember at this late hour.  My parents are telling me to get in bed, so I figure I should oblige them.  Be blessed! Neo

      Ugh.  I have found quite a few things that I would like to do with my blog, but I don't have the time or the ability to do them right now.  As soon as my blogging tools get back up and running, you can expect a few changes.  Nothing drastic, just a few changes to make my blog more interesting.  Unfortunately, I still can't blog correctly, for as I have said, I DON'T HAVE MY FORMATTING BUTTONS!!!  I'm kind of bothered by that.  Over on David's blog, "My Own Newspaper," I have been listed as the top blog for last week, even through my blogging difficulties.  Now I must defend my title...  I realize that there has been an unfortunate lack of political posts lately (and really a lack of posts in general).  I am very busy at present; I have about five e-mails to write, comments to place on other people's blogs, and about twelve acres of grass to cut.  Not to mention my LACK OF FORMATTING BUTTONS ON MY PUBLISHING PAGE!!  It really makes it hard to blog since I can't post links.  I really hope Blogger gets this stuff fixed soon.    Have any of you been experiencing problems publishing your blogs?  Tell me if you have or haven't, and let me know what browser you use (as in, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, etc.).  I'm using Internet Explorer 6.0, which means my new improved publishing page should work.  But as I have said before, IT DOESN'T!!  Soon I will be going out of town for a week or more (I'm not quite sure how long I will be gone), and I will not be able to blog.  Therefore, I will be on hiatus.  At present, I am only on a semi-hiatus, since I still post, though I'm not posting very frequently.  While I am on hiatus, please visit some of the blogs on my blogroll.  They all rock.  While you're at it, visit David Sessions's blog and website.  And don't forget to vote in my poll.  Well, I must go now.  I have to go cut a whole lot of grass, and I don't have much time to do it in.    Be blessed! Neo

      Hmm... This is bad.  I have discovered that I can publish correctly on my laptop, but when on my PC I can't get the bar with all the little buttons to come up above my text box.  After the publishing page is finished loading, that little bar above the task bar says "Error on page."  I guess that means that it didn't load the little buttons.    This is bad, because my laptop has a slower connection and I don't have as much internet time on it (parental controls, you know).  I've got to figure out a way to fix this.  Do you think Blogger Support could help me?  I could try them...  Man, this is definitely putting a cramp in my blogging style.  I'll try to be back to normal as soon as possible.  In the meantime, everyone vote in my poll, and then go visit David Session's Blog.  Maybe that will keep you occupied until I get things back to normal.

      Hello?  Is anyone there?  No one on my blogroll (not to be confused with conservative blogs I visit or liberal blogs I visit) has updated recently.  What's going on?  I'm all alone!  I'm the last blogger left who is willing to post.    At least David Sessions is posting.  And he's doing it with great frequency as well; allow me to renew my command to GO VISIT HIS BLOG (which I presently can't provide a link to)!  Maybe I'll do a little searching of the Blogger profile index.  Then I'll e-mail Blogger support to find out what's going on with the publishing interface.  I also just realized that I need to eat lunch.    I just noticed, D2M and Sara updated yesterday, so that's a plus.  For all you Blogspot users, do you still have the "add link" option on your publishing page?    Well, I just thought I'd update you on what's going on around here.  Be blessed, y'all.

      Okay, before I get to my post, I've got to say a few things.  #1:  Sorry I didn't post yesterday.  I've wasn't home from 9 in the morning to 10 at night.  Would you believe I was playing tennis the whole time?  #2:  Uh, I think the publishing interface has changed for Blogger.  I like it so far, but I haven't checked it out completely.  #3:  Okay, I can't think of a number three...  Now, about the F Scale.  The F Scale is basically a way to "yield an estimate of fascist receptivity at the personality level."  Considering my name, I figured this would be a good way to see if I have any fascist tendencies.  As it turns out, I scored a 4.03, a perfectly average number.  I am  "...disciplined but tolerant; a true American."    If I am conservative, and if I am also average, that completely blows the "right-wing extremist," "intolerant fundamentalist," and "out of the mainstream" arguments out of the water.  Technically, those who call us conservatives "fascists" are the ones who are not only out of the mainstream, but also quite ignorant.  They have no clue of what the fascists actually stood for, and so they choose to draw a comparison between two unlike groups (American conservatives and fascist bigots).    In order to see what you rank on the F Scale, click here--uh, okay, so I just realized that I can't make a link right now.  Instead, go to http://www.anesi.com/fscale.htm .  Then take the quiz.  I sort of miss the "preview" and "add link" features.  I hope they are added again soon.

      I have just been directed to an excellent blog and website owned by David Sessions, a college student.  On his website,  urlLink David-Sessions.com , David profiles John Edwards.  On his  urlLink blog , he wrote an excellent post on the irrelevance of states' rights in the homosexual marraige issue.  David apparently does a great amount of research, and that becomes evident in the quality of his posts.   Everyone, go check out his blog right now!

      I find it amazing how America's liberals hold such a vehement disdain for history.  Somehow they are always able to come up with some new way to distort and conceal the truth, often by simply lying.  Someone once said something to the effect of "tell enough people enough lies for long enough, and they will begin to believe them."  (can someone point me to the actual quote and author?)    The public school system in America has taken this to heart, teaching Evolution as fact.  That was unthinkable in Darwin's day, and despite the complete lack of evidence which would even remotely prove Evolution, the public school system has gotten away with teaching a false hypothesis.  The same could be said of "safe sex"; it is a baseless idea which has been advocated for so long that many people forgot why they opposed it.    But I'm off track...  Apparently the folks who made  urlLink this sign  were likewise failed by the public school system.  Their history class obviously did nothing to further the cause of truth, or foster a love of facts.  Even today, kids are being raised to believe that we lost the Tet Offensive and that we did some great thing by simply containing Communism, rather than wiping it out.    Sorry.  That's not what this post is about.  I must stay focused...  My point is this:  What on earth led these poor folks to believe that democracy is best taught by example?  There is not a democracy in existence (to my knowledge) that has not been won by the blood, sweat, and tears of the lovers of liberty.  Dictators are always reluctant to relinquish command to the people; they will never look at a democracy and think "wow, those guys are doing so good; I should run my country like that!"  Instead, dictatorships hate America because it is run by the people, and we out-perform their authoritarian genocide-machines.  It is a fallacy to believe that democracy must be taught by example.  How appealing would our democracy look if we walked around flaunting our freedom, all the while turning a blind eye to the brutal, genocidal dictators in the world?  In Iraq, we fought to free the Iraqis, and in so doing we got rid of those who would never learn democracy, whether by war or by example.    It is illogical to believe that democracy will form out of a dictatorship when liberty it is taught by example.  Dictators will not give up their positions of authority without bloodshed, and their people are rarely strong enough to fight for freedom themselves (remember Tiananmen Square?).  Those who are already free need to give a hand up to those who are in bondage.  To teach democracy by example is fine, once the democracy has been established.  I pray that Iraq will follow America's example in forming its democracy, even though they are following Islamic law, which has proven to be detrimental to democracy.  In ousting Saddam Hussein, however, we were not trying to teach democracy to anyone.  Instead, we were trying to establish a democracy which we were then going to teach by example.    Therefore let me offer this summary:  We are teaching democracy by example rather than by warfare.  We first used example to instill in the people of Iraq a longing for freedom, and then we used warfare to liberate them.  They shall now be taught democracy by our example and our guiding hand.  Example is the only way to teach a love of freedom, warfare is the only way to gain freedom, and example is the only way to teach freedom.    By invading Iraq, therefore, we were not teaching democracy by warfare.  What we were doing is attaining freedom for the Iraqis in the only way possible, considering Saddam's love of his authority and his desire to keep control over the Iraqis.  An example of teaching democracy by warfare would be to hold people at gunpoint and force them to go to the polls.  We are not doing that.  Instead, fought for liberty, and we prevailed, thus liberating millions of Iraqis.  These are the ones who fought, not for freedom, but simply to survive.  They lived fearful and destitute lives under Saddam, and now they have won their war against death.  They survived to see a better day, and even though they didn't free themselves, at least they made it.  The Iraqis would have never been able to depose Saddam Hussein.  It would have been suicide to attempt such.  We have given a hand up to the suffering Iraqis by using warfare to oust their malevolent ruler.  Now we shall teach them democracy, and we shall teach it by example.  Peace (through strength), y'all! Neo

      Dang it!  Because the terrorist animals have captured and threatened to kill a Filipino truck driver, the Philippines are  urlLink withdrawing  their soldiers from Iraq (all fifty of them).    Okay, so this won't hurt our numbers very much, but still, the loss is annoying.  Manila is withdrawing its troops because of terrorists, just as Spain did.  I keep wondering when the collective amnesia which pervades the world will lift, and people will begin to see that terrorists aren't just going to give up if you relent to them.  They have never done so, and they never will.    This will surely only encourage more terrorism in Iraq and abroad.  I doubt that the Filipino truck driver will even be released, though I have found it to be very hard to predict such evil, depraved neanderthals as those terrorists who capture and behead civilians.  The whole point of their kind of crime is to keep people guessing.  They want us to be sure of nothing, quivering with anxiety and apprehension, unsure of what the tomorrow, or even the next minute will bring.  If they can accomplish that, they can break the spirits of those whom they beseige, and once a nation's spirit is broken, the nation is lost.    Terrorism is as effective as it is vile, for bravery and grit are certainly not trademarks of our instant-gratification, if-it-feels-good-do-it culture.  Terrorism attacks the spirits of those towards whom its wrath is directed, and spirit of our nation has been weakened.  In WWII, our nation was strong, even in the face of several superpowers.  Japan made a sneak attack with suicide bombers on Pearl Harbor and was a threat to our mainland, but still our spirits remained unbroken.  Now, we are fighting against criminals using more radical forms of terrorism, bypassing soldiers at times in order to prey on civilians, and instead of being repulsed by the utter lack of conscience of those barbarians, we, in our spiritual brokenness, have those among us who would fight to appease and pacify our adversaries.  There are those among us who would rather throw down our hunting rifles and offer the rabid terrorist animals a cookie than valiantly defend the cause of liberty.  This sickens me.  Compassion, self-sacrifice, and strength of character have not been taught to those who preach modernized hippie-like liberalism.  Instead, self-preservation, impulsiveness, and avoidance of accountability are what define our culture.  No longer do we sympathize with the plight of millions of Christians and other demographic groups who are being brutally murdered by ruthless genocidal dictators around the world.  Instead, we look to the impotent U.N. to condemn the actions of such despots, which is also often avoided, since the despots are often among the ranks of the U.N. itself.  The United Nations is can no longer defend the world from the likes of those that it embraces.  When terrorists and dictators enter the U.N. in greater and greater numbers, its ability to fight injustice and crime is diminished, until it reaches its present point, which is total uselessness.    In Iraq, there is still a flickering  urlLink light .  The Salvation Movement, a vigilante group in Iraq, has threatened Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a dangerous terrorist.  I'm glad that this story got out; hopefully it will show America that we are actually doing a good thing and that there are still some people in the world who are willing to fight back against terrorism, even when America's liberals are not.  Kudos to the Salvation Movement; they are doing something that an established democracy, because of some of its more reluctant members, cannot.  Terrorists don't give up when they meet with success.  Period.  Their goal is world domination, and they view the U.S. and Israel as their biggest enemies.  If we give them a little bit of what they want, they will see our weakness and strive even harder to get more.  We can continue to give them little pieces of what they want, and eventually, America will be no more.  We can't give in to them now, or it will be harder to resist them later.  Spain has given in and the Philippines have already given in (something that is understandable, considering the political turbulence there), and we must fight with all our strength to avoid succumbing to the terrorist dogs.  If that means fighting unilaterally, so be it.  Simply because everybody else is doing it (or in this case, not doing it), that doesn't make it right.  We must fight terrorism, even alone if we have to.  If no one else fights against terrorism, then our victory will be all the greater, for when everyone else was too scared or too stupid to fight for liberty, we stepped up to the plate and conquered.    Peace (through strength), y'all! Neo

      Okay, so imagine a world where liberals were the only ones who wrote children's stories.  Scary huh?  If you can't visualize it, let me help you with these examples of politically correct and left leaning variations of classic stories.   Little Red Riding Hood  would read:  Red :  Why Grandmother, what a small welfare check you have!  ----   The Tortoise and the Hare  would read:  Tortoise :  Yay!  I won the race!   Hare :  What?! There's no way I could have lost!  I demand a recount!  ----   Snow White and the Seven Dwarves  Would be titled:  Snow White and the Seven Gay Dwarves   ----   The Boy Who Cried Wolf  would be titled:  The Bush Who Cried WMDs   ----   Frosty the Snowman  would read:  Frosty :  Oh no, I'm starting to melt!   Karen :  Dang it, and it's all because of global warming!  ----   Cinderella  would meet  Princess Charming .  ----   Jack and the Beanstalk  would read:  Jack's Mom :  Quick Jack!  Kill the Giant!   Jack :  Not yet mom.  I have to wait until I can prove that he has "a smoking gun."  ----   Chicken Little  would read:   Chicken Little :  THE SKY IS FALLING! THE SKY IS FALLING, AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF BUSH'S IRRESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES!  ----  * Romeo and Juliet  would read: Juliet:  Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo, and didst thou remember to bring "protection?"    Okay, so  Romeo and Juliet  isn't actually a kids' story.  Still, I couldn't resist...

      In case you haven't been following the situation in Israel, the Israelis have been trying to build a barrier to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out of Israeli settlements.  The World Court, however, has  urlLink ruled  that Israel has no right to defend herself.  At least, not in any effective manner.  The part of the wall that has thus far been constructed has saved many lives already, and will hopefully continue to do so.  A corrupt, biased court has attempted to override the national sovereignty of the nation of Israel, instead favoring the right to violence of an agressive terrorist society.    I just don't understand the reasoning behind the World Court's decision.  How is this supposed to decrease violence?  How are lives saved by denying defensive rights to a beseiged nation?  All that is accomplished by denying Israel the right to take defensive measures, something that is completely out of bounds for the World Court, is the satisfaction of terrorists, and that will not get anyone anywhere.  Though they will be satisfied, they will by no means be pacified; rather, they will be strengthened by receiving exactly what they have been working for and will meet kindness (or at least obedience) with renewed vigor in terrorist attacks.  Remember, don't feed the animals.  It is a travesty of justice for a court to rule in favor of avowed terrorists and order a sovereign nation such as Israel to make herself vulnerable to terrorist and guerilla tactics.  It is proof of the insanity or out time, and it is proof that anti-Semitism lives on despite the tragic memories of the Holocaust.  A Holocaust is still happening, and now it is happening in the Jewish homeland.  No longer are the Nazis mass-murdering Jews, but now it is the Muslims who attack and terrorize Israelis, indoctrinated differently, but by the same spirit as the Nazis.    In the world today, a Nazi is despicable.  The Nazis are seen for what they were, and few cling to their beliefs now.  However, a new anti-Semitic power is rising, and it is called radical Islam.  They indoctrinate children from birth to hate the Jews, and they send them to Israel strapped to explosives, vainly hoping for seventy virgins as a reward for their good deeds against the people who are referred to as "the descendents of apes and pigs" in the holy book of Islam.    Now, the radical Muslims have an added protection that the Nazis didn't have.  Whereas the Nazis were a political group, not necessarily united by race, but rather by ideology, the Muslims are a racial group.  To denounce Islam is considered tantamount to denouncing Arabs, and is quickly censored.  In this politically correct age, wrong is considered indefinable except in terms of intolerance.  Unfortunately, biggest intoleration of all is ignored, for pointing it out would be considered intolerance, rather than prudence.    These things indicate how far our feel-good culture has slipped into multiculturalism; we have struggled to be more open-minded for so long that our mind has fallen out.  No longer can we call evil evil, for to do so might hurt the feelings of the evil we speak of, and that would be truly evil.  Intolerance has been deemed the worst of all crimes and sins, but it has yet to be correctly defined.  Intolerance is now seen to be disagreement, and therefore all ideological disagreements with groups such as gays and welfare abusers are deemed intolerant and bigoted.  Meanwhile, Israel continues to suffer the per-capita equivalent of a 9/11 every week at the hands of the most active group of bigots ever to be supported by the civilized world.  If the Palestinians have a right to use terror tactics, then Israel should have a right to defend herself.  Israel is often condemned for capturing or killing Palestinian terrorists, the equivalent of enemy combatants, should the Palestinians be fighting a legitimate war.  Meanwhile, the Palestinians inflict heavy losses, not on Israeli military forces, but on the civilians who are going about their peaceful daily lives.  Such tactics are despicable, and any nation that supports them is thereby holding a double standard, allowing the Palestinians to fight illegally, while forcing Israel to fight with two hands tied behind her back.  Just how civilized is Europe and the U.N.?  Not civilized enough to recognize racism and bigotry, apparently.  Peace (through strength) y'all. Neo

      For any Trekkies out there, I just found  urlLink this  depressing piece of information.    James Doohan, affectionately known as "Scotty" by  Star Trek  fans, has been diagnosed with Alzheimers.  As it turns out, Mr. Doohan is a very interesting man.  Besides starring in  Star Trek , he was also an infantryman who was part of the D-Day attack on Normandy, where he was wounded.  It was while he was in the army that he learned the accent he used in  Trek .    According to the article,   In honor of Doohan, the theme of this year's "Star Trek" convention will be "Beam Me Up Scotty -- One Last Time,"

      I hate teen culture.  It’s true.  Call me crazy, but I tend to avoid people and things that are completely out of touch with reality, so it follows that I absolutely detest the stupidity that is teen culture.  Unfortunately, I find myself surrounded by it.  It is everywhere; to find it in schools is expected (though still disappointing, as stupidity is a disappointment wherever it is found), but teen culture is so ingrained into so many teenagers’ minds, that it follows them even to church.  When I denounce teen culture, I am not denouncing the musical styles that define it or any other such superficial thing (though the lyrics to the songs are often detestable and worthy of strong criticism), but rather I am criticizing something that goes much deeper.  When I criticize teen culture, I am criticizing the heart issues that so define and pervade our culture that every teen is at best affected by them and at worst engulfed in them.    Unfortunately, teens in general today tend to have little positive influence.  They spend hours at a time in front of the television, beaten over the head by images of illicit sex, drugs, immorality, and vulgar language, none of which is discouraged by the little glowing box in the corner, but rather glorified.  The kids see the illicit sex making its participants happy and without regret.  They see the drugs without the consequences.  They hear vulgar language so frequently that one would think that it is not only common and accepted, but encouraged and healthy.  They are shown immorality, but not taught that the wages of sin is death.  Upon being affected by the media in such a way, the more weak-minded in society go out and imitate what they have seen (monkey see, monkey do).  Since misery loves company, the weak-minded legions (for they are many) attempt to pressure their peers into joining them in their sinful pastimes.  Some consent, and thereby assimilate into the masses of immoral teens, increasing their numbers, and thus their influence over non-assimilating teens.  Over time, the depraved masses have grown in number and influence to the point that they nearly hold a monopoly on the minds of teens across the country.  Even the teens who choose not to participate in the pastimes of their immoral peers have a tendency to be overly accepting and lax toward immorality and sin.  Rather than calling sin as it is, they operate on the doctrine that has been pumped into them by the school system and the media, and they believe that sin is a personal choice, something subjective rather than objective.  Rather than holding their peers accountable to a higher power, they tend to brush off the sins of their peers, again operating under the pretense taught to them by society, that if many people are committing a sin, then it ceases to be a sin and becomes a matter of personal choice.     If anyone should find my analysis to be incorrect, they need only look at some teenagers to prove my points.  The media glorifies gangsta rappers, who wear their pants about ten sizes too large.  The village idiots (which are unfortunately great in number) proceed to imitate their role models both in manner and appearance.  They then lose all fashion sense (perhaps the least of their offenses), they lose their respect for women, and they begin to act with all manner of immorality in order to become like those who have been deemed cool.   They then begin to collectively apply pressure to the non-idiots in society, and force them to conform as well to the standard placed before them by such trendsetters as Nelly and Eminim.  Unfortunately, many teens don’t realize that they shouldn’t conform to standards which require them to crouch to new lows; instead they only see that if they conform, they will be accepted by those “cool” peers who have shunned them of late.  If guys wear clothes that are too big, girls just refuse to wear clothes.  Some of the things that girls wear today wouldn’t have been fit to be underwear in saner times.  In their attempts to please guys and get attention from them, they imitate the objects that the guys rave about.  I’m sorry, but Playboy is not a good place to get tips on how to dress.  Whereas fashion sense is one of the lesser offenses of the male gender in the quest for acceptance, it is among the worse offenses of the young ladies.  It is wrong to lead other people to sin, and that’s exactly what girls are doing today.  The problem is sort of a vicious cycle; girls wear such clothes because that’s what the guys like to see, but the girls could have the self-control and simply dress modestly and the problem would be over.  At the same time, if guys stopped pressuring girls to wear such attire, the problem would likewise be fixed.  Neither party is innocent.  These are only a few examples of the destruction the media has wrought.  It is slowly desensitizing us to sin, and encouraging us to participate in it.  It is taking the minds of our peers captive, and using them to pressure us into conforming and becoming cool.  It is destroying our society, starting with our Christian heritage.  When sin is portrayed as something of personal choice, it opens the door for things like gay marriage.    Unfortunately, the devil’s hand in this world, the media, has ensnared many of our peers.  They now subscribe to the destructive, relativistic worldview that defines what has been the downfall of so many nations before us.  Teenagers are the future voters, the future leaders.  If we cannot win them back before adulthood, our nation will be lost, and our causes with it.  Teenagers, as I have shown, take on the characteristics that they are shown by the media and by their peers, and the media is blatantly anti-Christian on every subject imaginable, leading many teens to be of similar convictions.  With our young people being taken hostage and brainwashed, the future looks bleak.  There is only one antidote for this, and that is the Gospel.  We would have a hard time convincing television stations to change their programming, especially since the majority of their audience is simply enthralled by sin.  Instead, the task is ours to be salt and light to the world.  We are in the world, and there is no way around that; we must strive to not be of the world.    I say this so often, and that is because it rings so true.  As Edmund Burke said,   ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph [of evil] is for good men to do nothing.’  We must fight the generations of good men’s apathy toward the spread of evil.  Those good men in the world neglected to put out the sparks of pluralism and progressive education, and now they have grown into raging fires.  Good men failed us in earlier times, but that is no excuse for us.  Surrender is not an option.  Co-habitation is not an option.  Good and evil cannot coexist, and I don’t plan on going anywhere.  Though we suffer from lesser numbers, we have the truth on our side; we have God on our side, and if God is for us, who can be against us?  There is a crisis at hand.  We are good men, and let us never be accused of doing nothing.  If our predecessors allowed evil’s cause to gain a strong foothold, we have no cause to blame them.  Instead, our call is to fight the evil tooth and nail.  Let it be so that, no matter what was done before us and no matter what is done when we have passed, we can always say that during our watch, evil didn’t gain an inch.  The Gospel must be spread, and righteousness must now replace the sinfulness that the world idolizes.  We must win the hearts and minds of our peers, thus retaking territory that we should never have lost in the first place.  America must experience a revival, and that revival must be strongest in the hearts of the young people, for as has already been stated, on the young people rests the future of America.  Revival will not start itself, but the fervent prayers of righteous men availeth much.  We, as good men, must fight inaction and pray.  We must then take action on our prayers and win the souls of the hopelessly lost who populate our schools and our neighborhoods.    Let it never be said of us that we, in our selfish apathy, allowed evil to triumph in our time.  Instead, let us fight for Truth, “…for albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng troops of beautiful, tall angels to enshield her from all wrong.”  ( urlLink James Russell Lowell,  The Present Crisis )    Instead, let us be remembered as those valiant few who effected worldwide change by simply placing their faith in God and acting upon it.  As good men, if we can’t be remembered for that, let us not be remembered at all.

      I realize that I haven't posted much lately, but please be patient; you haven't got much longer to wait.  I am presently on the third draft of a rather lengthy thesis and am hoping to post it today or tomorrow.  I can't make any promises, but it will be here soon.  Until then...  John Kerry is now on the campaign trail with his V.P. pick,  urlLink John Edwards .   urlLink Liberal Mommy  seems quite happy about this, even though she didn't get what she  urlLink wanted .   Personally, I think the choice was all right, but I had hoped Kerry would make  urlLink this  choice for his runningmate.    I still think that Bush is going to win.  Edwards seems more in touch with reality than Kerry, but Kerry is so "out there" that I think he's unelectable.  Remember what I said about his dreamworld where America is a third world country in need of inspiration from such enlightened countries as France?    I guess Kerry chose Edwards because people say he is good looking.  The Americans are such a dumb people that many of us will vote for a person just because he is good looking (or in this case, because he has a good looking runningmate).  Well, it doesn't matter.  The White House is not gained by way of a fashion show; it is gained through an election which takes place in this place called reality, and Kerry is so absent from reality that he can't possible be elected.  He does have a few followers of the "anyone-but-Bush" kind who will stick with him, but that's just because they have left the real world in favor of the one Kerry inhabits.  Maybe I'm wrong.  What do you think?  Can Kerry, with his  new runningmate, beat Bush in November (a frightening prospect)?  I shudder to even think about that.  So tell me, what chance does Kerry have?

      You may have noticed that I haven't been posting very frequently lately, and that is due to a combination of factors.  First, I have been very busy cutting grass.  We have about 12 acres of grass to cut, and even though my dad helps me out, it still takes a few days.  Also, since I am homeschooled and we just built a house and moved a few days ago, I am not finished with school for the year yet.  It will get done, I just won't get much of a summer vacation.  I have also been visiting other blogs and commenting on them.  A busy life, combined with the fact that the parental controls on my computer only allow me two hours of internet access on weekdays, makes it hard for me to find stories of interest.    Hopefully, things will be calming down soon, and I will be able to return to my previous posting schedule.  Until then, I will just have to do my best.  Thanks for reading!  Be blessed!

      There hasn't been a lot to post on, or a lot of time to post lately.  Therefore, I'm going to toss a some CCM song lyrics out there for your enjoyment.    This song,  I'm Not Ashamed , is pretty much vintage Newsboys.  Though it's by no means my favorite song, it has a worthy message.   I'm not ashamed to let you know I want this light in me to show. I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ.  What are we sneaking around for? Who are we trying to please? Shrugging off sin, apologizing like we're spreading some kind of disease. I'm saying, "No way. No way."  I'm not ashamed to let you know I want this light in me to show. I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ.  This one warns it's lost cause, save your testimonies for churchtime. The other ones state you'd better wait until you do a little market research. I'm saying, "No way. No way."  I'm not ashamed to let you know I want this light in me to show. I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus   Hmm, I wonder if Bunnie would call this song craptacular.  It appears to mention Jesus enough for her, but would she take issue with the cliches, which are scarce (more scarce than in most songs, actually), but nonetheless there.    This song has a good message about boldness.  Sometimes we as Christians get too timid, and we need to be reminded that we must be a light to the world.  The Gospel is not a disease, but rather, it's the cure.  To quote DCTalk,  "The disease of self... is a cancer fatal to my soul"  God's big.  I mean really big.  Why would we be scared to share the Gospel, the cure for all that ails the world, considering that God is on our side?    "If God be for us, who can be against us?"

      Saddam Hussein, in a  urlLink hearing  on Thursday, made a quite Kerry-like statement:   "You know that this is all a theater by Bush, the criminal, to help him with his campaign,"   Maybe Kerry and Saddam are long lost brothers; they seem to think a lot alike, considering they both lie and convince themselves that their lies are true.  Or, Maybe Saddam has just been watching too many Michael Moore movies; he seems to think that he has done nothing wrong and that Bush is an evil dictator.  Excessive Moore-watching would definately account for Saddam's willful ignorance.  I still don't understand how someone like Saddam can refer to Bush as a criminal.  Seriously though, he's denying that he gassed the Kurds, and he tried to justify the invasion of Kuwait.  I think he believes that he didn't do any of those things.  Repeatedly, those in contact with him have referred to him as psychotic.  Even over the course of the hearing, he experienced several mood swings.  The man's a psycho!!  Ok, enough of that.  Let's look at the facts:  We  know  that he murdered the Kurds, no matter what he says.  We  know  that he had WMDs, and there is much evidence that they are still in existence (it is widely believed that he shipped them out of Iraq at the last minute).  We  know  that he had WMDs because he used them on the Kurds.  We  Know  that there was a connection between al-Qaeda and Saddam.   urlLink Here  an excellent viewpoint on their connection.  We  know  that he defied authority by refusing to allow investigators into his country, making a mockery of the "Oil for Food" program, and ignoring the U.N. in its commands for him to destroy his WMDs.  We  know  that he invaded Kuwait in order to "give (his army) something to do" because he distrusted them.  We  know  that he and his officials (including his sons) beat, raped, tortured and killed civilians for entertainment.    We  know  that Saddam and his loyalists have a  urlLink plan  for destablizing Iraq.  These are all things that we know, and considering the immense loss of life at Saddam's hands (not to mention all of his other crimes), I would say that the death penalty is the only just punishment for such a vile man.  I'm not the kind of person that goes around screaming for shoplifters to be executed, but some crimes against humanity simply must be punished.    He has been handed over to the Iraqis, so his fate is in their hands.  I hope they have the presence of mind to remember what he did to them and to make the right choice about his punishment.  It would be a true travesty of justice to let such a bloodthirsty villain live.

       urlLink Bill Cosby  is certainly brave.  He has spoken against the gangsta culture which pervades low-income black America, and he continues to hold his ground.  GO BILL!!!    Please ignore the liberal slant in the article I linked to; I thought it might be neat to see what the dems think about Bill's "tirade."  I wonder what happens to a conservative black man in Hollywood when he speaks out in such a way as Mr. Cosby has?  Cosby has said things that white compassionate conservatives have been saying for years, only they said it under their breath to avoid being labeled racist.  I am not a racist; if anyone believes that then he is in a dreamworld where Kerry is president.  I am someone who agrees with Bill Cosby.  I see behavioral problems in low-income black America (LIBA) which need to be fixed.  I also see behavioral problems in low-income white America, and high-income America.  The middle class has it's own set of problems.  All of these problems need to be fixed.    Unfortunately, every time someone tries to point out the quite obvious problems that bind LIBA, they are labeled as a "racist," and quickly ostracized.  I can't even say that all of LIBA has these problems, but all of LIBA has to deal with these problems.  The problems that they have are more common in LIBA than in other demographic groups; that is not debatable.  I could go on, but I think that "the Cos" has already said everything I would say, and he has said it better than I can anyway.  God bless Bill Cosby.

      “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.”  I think we can all recognize the first part of the Lord’s Prayer.  Recognition, however, is not what we are shooting for.  What does this prayer imply, and why should we pray like this?  I could examine the whole Prayer, but for now I will stick with this part.    First, let’s think about prayer.  What is it?  The way I see it, prayer is simply talking to God.  We can intercede for people through prayer; in other words, we can pray for them.  We can also pray for ourselves, that our needs will be met.  We can also pray to God and simply spend time with Him, getting to know Him through prayer and reading His word.   When we pray, we are to pray according to God’s will; in other words, if we pray “God, in the name of Jesus, I pray that I will become a duck,” we will not be made into a duck.  However, if we pray something that God wants to do, something that He wills, it will be done.  So how do we know what God wills?  Through reading the Bible.  God lays out his will in the Bible. Therefore, we know that when we pray something, say, that He would “…supply all my needs through his riches in glory through Christ Jesus,” we know that it will be done, because He said so in His word, and God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.    Another example is that “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and of sound mind.”  That is in the Bible, and therefore, it is to be believed.  It follows, then, that we have no reason to be afraid because that fear that we feel comes not from God but from the devil.  Also, “The devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy,” but “all God’s promises are yes and amen.”  Therefore, if someone loses everything they have, if they die, or if other misfortune falls upon them, it has not been sent by God, but rather it has been sent by the devil.  God does not hurt his beloved creation; He can, however, remove his protection from his wayward children.  When He does that, the devil is free to come into that person’s life and steal, kill, and destroy, since God’s protection has been removed.  God can chasten his beloved, but He does so by removing his protection from them.    But now let’s look at the Lord’s prayer.  I want to focus on this part:  “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.”  Jesus said that is how we are to pray.  So why would we pray something like that if there is no chance we are going to get it?  We are to pray that because it is God’s will.    Now what would happen if God’s will was done on earth as it is in heaven?  To determine what God’s will in heaven is, we must look to heaven.   For starters, there would be no strife.  In heaven the Baptists aren’t still fighting with the Methodists and the Pentecostals aren’t still arguing with more reserved denominations.  Instead, I think that in heaven, all are united in their love and worship of God.  If heaven is like that, it is undoubtedly God’s will that heaven would be like that, and when we pray the Lord’s Prayer, we are asking for God’s will in heaven to be done on earth.  I believe that God wants unity among Christians (though not ecumenism), even if we don’t agree on certain points of doctrine which don’t affect our overall salvation.    The bickering among denominations in the body of Christ is sinful.  The body of Christ is meant to work like a body, with all the parts working together.  However, with all the fighting, the body of Christ looks like it is having a seizure.  The toes are pulling on the ears and the mouth is biting the knee.  That’s not what’s meant to happen.  God wants us to work together to further the influence of the Gospel, not argue over whether baptism is sprinkling or dunking.  Such matters which don’t affect the salvation of the individual are small compared to common ground which all Christians have in Christ.  To cause strife because of them is prideful and sinful.    Paul warned us to avoid sectarianism, saying that is carnal, or of the flesh, to say “I am of Paul,” or “I am of Apollos,” reminding us that we are all “of Christ.”  Unfortunately, different groups interpret the Bible differently.  Therefore, differing opinions are inevitable.  The best thing we can do is, in my opinion, to avoid causing strife with one another.  Debate is great among Christians, so long as there is no strife.  When strife ensues, it is best to simply agree to disagree, and to remember that all Christians have the common ground of Jesus Christ.  Finally, I must remind you that I am not advocating ecumenism, or Unitarianism, which is basically believing that there are many ways to God.  The Unitarians are a liberal sect (or even a cult) which, in its attempts to avoid offending people, has watered down everything in its teaching until nothing but a skeleton remains where Christianity once stood.  That is not the solution to division.  Instead, we must understand that even though we interpret the Bible differently, we agree on Salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and nothing else is worth causing strife over.  In other words, if you want to sprinkle water on someone’s head in order to baptize him, be my guest.  I’ve been dunked, and I will advocate dunking.  Even though our methods differ slightly, the point is that the person has been baptized.   Christ is bigger than any of our petty differences.

      So the Iraqis now have power in Iraq.  The transfer of power came two days early, in order to thwart the terrorists who would undoubtedly try to coordinate some attacks and "make a statement."    The situation in Iraq is still not perfect in my opinion.  However, I want to hear from you guys on this one.    Was it a good idea to transfer power two days early?  Was it a good idea to transfer power at all before Iraq can be reconstructed?  Can Iraq succeed, or will it flounder in radical Islam?  What do you think?

      Ah, smart music. For everyone who likes their music to actually have something to say, I have found the band for you. Sure, the trumpet and trombone are a little hard to get used to, but the message in the O. C. Supertones’ music is just awesome! For me, Supertones music is an acquired taste. I had to listen to it for a while before I really began to appreciate it.  I have recently decided that I like the Supertones, and I came across their album Chase the Sun in our van. Since their music is so original, I have decided to go over some of their songs from Chase the Sun. First up is the first song on the cd, One Voice. The song is from 1999, so don’t worry about the reference to the year in the first line.  O. C. Supertones: One Voice From the album  Chase the Sun   1999 and the stakes is high. Our options have come down To either we do or we die. We need You now more than ever. Pull out all of the strife in the church, Get us together.  Is time running out? I can’t say. I do know We have one day less Than we did yesterday.So it’s up to us to unite; You wanna fight the power? You need the power to fight.  (chorus) And can we sing with one voice, If we all love the same God? Can we agree to disagree? And so we cry with one voice To the only God in all the universe Who holds us in His hands.  No more time For us to bicker and complain. If we’re called by the same name. There’s nowhere for us to lay the blame Except for ourselves, And if we died of our old selves To come alive as God’s flesh, That makes us family.  Deeper than death, But we don’t act so tight When there’s a back to bite. Are we less like a family, and More like a fistfight? Are we there, but not quite? Are hypocrites children if light?  (repeat chorus)  Man, I even liked typing it. Of course, it helps to listen to the song, but the words alone can put forth the case for unity in the church quite well, and they do so in a short amount of time. Seriously, we’ve got bigger things to worry about than whether or not those folks over there pray in tongues. We’ve got a unified enemy and we’re on his turf, and all we can think about is how we can’t stand those “flaky televangelists.” We’re too busy attacking other Christians over how they were baptized to even defend ourselves against attacks from the devil, much less mount a believable attack on the kingdom of darkness. “Are we less like a family and more like a fistfight?” Unfortunately (and irresponsibly), yes.  At what point did we stop thinking about winning souls? We are in a war with the kingdom of darkness, and the souls of billions of people are at stake. Instead of concentrating our collective efforts in a unified front against our common enemy, we waste our energy on petty, factious infighting. Imagine our enemy’s joy when he marches into battle only to find that those that he would strive against have turned on each other! Through our prideful negligence, we abandon our first priority in favor of pursuing a carnal, man-made goal (denominationalism), and in the process we end up slaughtering the cause we claim to champion (love).  With all the conflict in the body of Christ, it’s no wonder we are called hypocrites. We preach a message of love, but our message falls flat in the wake of our infighting. If we preach love, but we can’t even love each other, why should anyone listen to us? We, in all our pompous spirituality, say “love thy neighbor” while neglecting to love even our own brothers in Christ. We are supposed to have died of our old selves and come alive as God’s flesh, thus becoming family, but when it comes right down to it, we refuse to even love our brothers. As Christians, our relation is supposed go deeper than death, so surely it goes deeper than our carnal sectarianism.  We as Christians must realize that we are in a war, a struggle, between light and darkness. Because of that, we cannot live and function as though we have the luxury of being able to nit-pick and fight with other Christians like angry siblings. We cannot pretend that we have nothing better or more important to do than to bicker with Christians whose minor points of doctrine offend us. In WWII, many nations with disagreements came together to fight an impending evil, forgetting their differences and swallowing their arrogance and pride in order to defend the values that they all held dear.  That is how we must be. We are Christians, and as such, our first priority is to spreading the Gospel. Our call is not to get up in arms against our brothers because they like to swing a little incense; we should instead pick up our swords in defense of the fundamental parts of Christianity. We should stand up next to each other and fight for the basic tenets of our faith which we all hold dear, fighting against the enemy that threatens us all, rather than attacking our allies over small doctrinal disagreements.  We are the body of Christ, and as I have said before, all the parts of the Body should work together. If a house divided against itself cannot stand, then the church in danger of losing what influence it still has. Despite our disagreements, we are all in the same boat. It’s stupid to turn our cannons on each other when we are in a life and death struggle with the prince of the power of the air! Divided, we are a bickering bunch of impotent hypocrites, but united, we are unstoppable. If Christ is at our head, and we are all obedient to Him, there is nothing in this world that can stop us from winning the world to Christ.  Be blessed! Neo

      Well, I've submitted my blog for review on  urlLink The Weblog Review .  So am I a glutton for punishment or what?  Meanwhile, my HTML continues to go whacky on me.   I am seriously considering switching to another blog hosting site, but Blogger is the best free one I can find.  It's just so flaky.  I could upgrade to the paid version of Blogger, but that costs money (obviously).  The only thing I can see working out is upgrading the the paid version, and then placing just enough paid ads to pay for my blog.   What do you guys think?  Do you know anything about placing ads on your site, and if so, would it be a good idea for me to switch?

      In a 5-2 decision, the California Supreme Court  urlLink nullified  the same-sex marriages performed in San Francisco.  Though the ruling didn't address the issue of the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, it did set a good precedent.  Skipping the legislative process, the mayor of San Francisco had begun allowing same-sex marriages, but the courts struck back in favor of democracy.  Since the FMA is for the moment incapacitated, a ruling like this is great for the pro-straight crowd.  Now if only someone would do something about Massachusetts...

      When will we learn what happens when we let MTV produce our events? According to  urlLink Bunnie Diehl , Kid Rock and Britney Spears will be performing at the  Republican  National Convention!   NOOOOOOOO!  For goodness sake, what will Kid Rock sing that will be suitable for Republicans?  Is Britney actually going to get dressed for this performance?  Dear Lord, what were the Convention planners thinking?  Okay, so MTV isn't really producing the Convention, but one would think so.  I just pray that there will be no "wardrobe malfunctions."  We had better look out though, because comedian Margaret Cho has said that she is going to try to get arrested at the Convention.  This sounds like it will be quite an interesting time for the Republican Party.  Other stars who will be appearing at the RNC will be Dennis Miller, Lee Ann Womack, Brooks and Dunn, and Kelsey Grammar.

      You may have noticed that I have not written anything about  Fahrenheit 9/11  on my blog.  The reason for that is that I am just weary of it; it's nothing but lies and distorted truths, and there are so many of them that I really don't want to take the time to refute Mr. Moore.    urlLink David Sessions , however, has seen the movie and written an exceptional article about it.  Here's the good part:  his article as included on the front page of  urlLink The Rant !  The article is called  urlLink Propaganda Comes To Town , and I recommend that everyone read it.  Great job, David!  Keep up the good work!

      Thanks to  urlLink Sara  for e-mailing me those pics.  If you liked the pictures, you'll really like this.  Some veterans who served with Kerry in the Vietnam war are coming out and claiming that he lied in order to receive medals and that he lied about the conduct of American soldiers in Vietnam. The  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  (Swift Boat Vets FAQs  urlLink here ) is a multi-partisan effort to get Kerry to release his military records and thus show his justification for obtaining a bronze star, silver star, and three purple hearts in a four month period.  The accusations they level at Kerry are fairly serious. For instance, they claim that Kerry lied to receive a bronze star. Kerry claims that he saved a fellow serviceman while under heavy enemy fire from both sides. Other veterans who were at the scene, however, say that there was no enemy fire directed at the boats. SBVT also claims that "It is clear that at least one of Kerry's Purple Heart awards was the result of his own negligence, not enemy fire, and that Kerry went to unusual lengths to obtain the award after being turned down by his own commanding officer." I hope this stuff gets out. I don't think a four-month tenure which caused Kerry's fellow servicemen turn against him constitutes heroics, despite what Kerry would have you believe. I encourage you to read the Swift Boat Veterans' site; post a link to them. They have lots of interesting information.  Be blessed! Neo

      Bunnie Diehl is back, and she has tossed up for discussion the song "Here With Me" by MercyMe.  You can  urlLink mosey on over there  if you want to see my opinion of the song and keep up with the discussion.  And of course, you are welcome to help me out as well (though I know some of you *pokes  urlLink D2M * would prefer to stay far far away).   Well, I've got lots of grass to cut.   Be blessed!

      I'm sure that by now you have seen the link on my page pronouncing that I am a slimy mollusc. If you're the curious type, you have probably clicked on it to see what the heck it was about. If you haven't, or if you just didn't get it, I thought I'd take a little time to explain it.  The "The Truth Laid Bear Ecosystem" is a directory of blogs that ranks blogs by inbound links. Your ranking improves by the number of other blogs that link to you, provided the other blogs are in the Ecosystem. That means that if someone links to you, but they aren't in the Ecosystem, that link won't be counted toward your ranking. I noticed that  urlLink Laura  has already joined the Ecosystem.  Anyway, I just thought it would be a neat way to see how I rank in the blogosphere. If you want to add your blog to the Ecosystem, just click  urlLink here , and remember that the more inbound links you get, the higher your ranking will be.  Be blessed! Neo

      Wow, a lot has happened since the last time I updated my blog! Let’s see if I can fill you in…  I believe the last time I left you I was leaving Rockaway, NJ for the Big Apple. That’s right, I visited NYC! It was amazing! First we went on a boat to see the Liberty Enlightening the World, better known as the Statue of Liberty, and of course it was magnificent. But that was just the beginning…  When we got off the boat, there was a man who was trying to get us to take a tour of the city in his limo. He was charging 120 dollars for two hours. While he was talking to us, there was a guy standing behind him motioning to my dad to not take the limo. When Mr. Limo had finished talking to us and left, the guy behind him introduced himself. He and his family live in NYC and they couldn’t bear for someone to pay 120 dollars to see the city in a car when it is better seen on foot. They had simply planned on walking around the city that day, so they invited us along and gave us a tour of the city! We saw so much that it is hard to list it all! We saw Rockefeller Plaza, Fifth Avenue, Trump Tower, the Empire State Building (we didn’t go to the top), and St. Patrick’s Cathedral with a wedding in progress. We also saw THE Toys R Us, their three-story flagship store. We saw Radio City Music Hall, the Wall Street Building, a five star hotel called The Plaza which we briefly went into (so amazingly ornate that it bordered on gaudy), Central Park, and more. We took loads of pictures too!  On the subject of pictures, I’m sorry I haven’t posted many. I’ve been quite busy, but I will get around to posting them. Unfortunately, I have to cut grass during this coming week, so blogging may be scarce.  Anyway, for supper we ate with our tour-guide family at a club called Jekyll and Hyde’s. It was definitely interesting, and hard to describe as well. It was sort of themed around old horror movies…  We had a great time in New York City. After dinner, we had to leave and our friends had to go home. To top off our trip, we got to ride a taxi back to the ferry docks. The trip was probably one of the best experiences I have ever had.  After that, we headed to Hershey, PA for a couple of days at Hershey Park. I had fun there too, though not as much fun as I had in New York. I finished overcoming my fear of roller coasters there, simply by riding them. I ended up riding almost all of the coasters they have by the time we left.  Now I’m back home, and things are fine, though I have a lot to do. I need to start cutting the grass, since I cut it before I left and in a week and a half it has grown back up. Anyway, I should be kept busy for a while with some catching up on stuff. Anyway, I’ve got to go now.  Be blessed! Neo
