      i sit here, eating my zoodles and crackers, waiting for my laundry, thinking.  im sure im not the only that contemplates life.  that is the biggest question any human being ponders about.  where we come from and where do we go.  and where the heck did all this stuff called matter come from.  everyone can have a belief or theory to go on, but each of those mindsets are questioned, debated, never 100% proven, or seen for truth.  we're not meant to completely understand?  if we all did, what would that be like?  so what do we go on, what do we believe?  everyone's different in the matter and it makes war.  we were made to be like this?  when you know there's a bigger question out there, something bigger that has tied all this together, and makes you think what really are you living in.  and what is living?  so we just walk through this story of life, we're only here in this world of matter for a short time, breathing a certain number of breaths to make our shell last for this short time, and then what?  all we know of is this earth.  we dont know what we were like before getting our shell that breathes.  we dont know what we will be like after we leave this ground.  so all we know is this.  and all some will believe is matter.  cuz seeing is all they have known.  others have stepped outside these walls and feel and know and believe something besides seeing.  they can know that there is a space more to this one.  outside of this one.  is it our purpose to be here, down here on this ball of matter.  where is our real home, certainly not here, since this place is but just a vapour of time.  where we came from and where we are going is really where we belong.  we're just passing through here in these bodies...i think to be accompolishing something, so we can go back.  go back to where we are supposed to be.  makes me feel like an alien in this world.  its nothing but a game.  a monopoly.  the only way to survive on this small ball is money.  and so it becomes a game.  strategies to make it through.  to play the game man has made.  but at the same time, doing our purpose for the One that made this all.  so we gotta be two things.  gotta go through two things.  it always seems to be two things.  two sides.  but only can be engrossed on one side.  i guess you just gotta do what you gotta do to survive here and that is to play man's game.  but the greater focus is the greater space.  remembering, even though this is all we have seen, this is not where we come from, and we wont be here forever.  there is something else much greater than this ball, out there.  waiting for us.  but wanting us to do what we have to do here first.  cuz one day, we'll be free out of this shell again.  we will fly again.

      so i'm thinking of starting this blog spot.  a slight warning of future inconstancies.  but we'll see where the winds take me.  no biography novels included in this first post.  but i will be back with more.
