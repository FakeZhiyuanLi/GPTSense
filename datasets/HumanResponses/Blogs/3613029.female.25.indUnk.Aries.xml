      "And this I believe:  that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world.  And this I would fight for:  the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected.  And this I must fight against:  any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual.  This is what I am and what I am about.  I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system.  Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts.  If the glory can be killed, we are lost." -- John Steinbeck, "East of Eden"

      I at times envy those who never have to struggle... I sometimes envy those that are "popular"--that have a huge social network...  I sometimes envy those that are desired...  But then I stop...  I stop feeling sorry for myself and look at these people and realize that half of them will never know what "love" is...  I don't mean just the "love" that titles an intimate relationship, I just mean love in general...  Some of these people will never have a parent whose love is truly unconditional...  Who will listen, half asleep, while you sob your eyes out because you have had yet another unsuccessful relationship...  A parent who has loved you through all the hair color experimentation, the change of style, the added jewelry to the body...  A parent that would do anything for you...  Some of these people will never have a best friend, who, may drive you nuts at times, thinks the world of you... A best friend that makes you feel that there is no one in the world that could even come close to being as wonderful as you... A best friend, who may not agree with you, but will support you throughout the changes of lifestyle...  Some of these people will never have friends that love you for you...  That will still think that you are an amazing person even if you keep that old stinkin' truck you purchased right out of highschool...  Friends that will love you irregardless of what you don't have...

      Things, things, things... Bombarded by things...  People and their toys...  Boats and SUV's and ATV's and goodness knows what else... People that feel entitled to more while others are fighting to the basic right of shelter and food and clothing...  This is not to say that I live as if I were poor... goodness, no...  But I do empathize with those in the "lower middle class"...  Our government believes that our minimum wage provides "the necessities"...  Maybe it does, I dunno, but what living human being wants to just exist?  Who doesn't aspire for more?  For a home?  For the ability to pay for their children' college tuition?  To be able to travel and learn and grow... And how is anyone supposed to do that if one is struggling day by day by day...  I think people try to satisfy, or mask, their unhappiness with these 'toys'--extraneous items that only further pollute the world...  Not just because of the exhaust, but with the noise and the congestion... It's pretty bad when lakes and rivers become congested, don't ya' think?  I do enjoy certain comforts, but each successive year, I realize there isn't too many 'things' that I want anymore...  Right now I just want things that apply to me--the arts, music, literature (and basics like food, clothing, & shelter)...  If my truck could last forever I would be ecstatic (though I know she won't, she's done pretty well for me so far)...  I don't exist to impress anyone else...  And if anyone is ever embarrassed by my lack of things, than obviously they have no respect or real care for me--and obviously they can just get the heck out of my life b/c I have no time for that crap...  I'm always considering what will be left when my body passes from this world...  What good are my 'things'?  I'd rather leave an impression...  Maybe a great artist... A great musician...  Or maybe I impacted just one person... That would be fantastic...  I wish people would think about that more...  I don't like the idea of death any more than the next person, but it is reality...  And what do you want to leave when you pass?  A bunch of 'things' that your living relatives have to dispose of somehow?  Or your character...  Your charisma... Your kindness...  Knowledge that you are just more than a 'thing'...  I dunno, I'm just so tired of people wanting more for themselves and expecting me to want the same thing... I don't...  I'm not anyone but me dang it!!  I'm not like all of society and though it is a battle, it is one that I am willing to fight...

      Generally, I don't regret any of my experiences, I just see my "mistakes" as life lessons...  But I do regret things I have not done--which is to always be honest.  I thought at times by bending my words I was making things easier on people that I cared about or even so much as to love...  But I wasn't helping anyone...  I especially wasn't helping myself...  I wish I could apologize to all those who I have lied to and I wish I could tell them the truth, but I can't... What's done is done...  I know now, and forever, that truth befits all situations...  (okay, okay, except for those instances when there is a fun surprise--like knowledge of a party or proposals)  I will never forget the things I have said or the people I have hurt, but I hope someday that I can forgive myself... Because dang it if it doesn't hurt...  Lies catch up to you...  Even if you never get caught, your conscience will see fit to admonish you...

      What??  What is this ludicrous that I have posted??  Yes, it is true, I am thinking the twins.  I am thanking them for reminding me how idiotic and greasy the males species can be.  Thanking them for reminding me that I need to take care of myself first and when I am ready, I will meet the right man--emphasis on MAN (not these thumb-sucking guys I've been dating)...  Radio--t.v.--I hear these nasty boys stating how excited--yes, excited--that these two young ladies have become "legal"...  These two young ladies, albeit, very pretty, I would not define as sexy...  Or wise...  Or witty...  Or worldly...  They have money...  They have marketed themselves well, and they have more money than I will see in a lifetime, but they are girls nonetheless...  So again, thank you Mary Kate and Ashley, for helping us women weed out the men from the boys...

      Where did the adage, "No pain, no gain" come from?  Dang, I'm not trying to gain anymore, I'm trying to lose that excess luggage that is trying to infest my body...  Ugh... I was storing up for the winter... Yeah, that is my excuse...    So it was the first glorious day in a few weeks (frequent stormage in these parts) and I went for a bike ride... I had forgotten that it rained yesterday so there were a few unexpected puddles that opted to choose the path I was riding on...  Dang them...  But hey, mud is good for the skin, right?  I think I need a face mask when I ride a bike--bugs feel like pellets when you're cruisin' down a mad steep hill...  At least none decided to nest in my nose, ears, or mouth...  I think...  So if I turn into 'the fly', will ya'll still love me??  It did feel good to be outside but I think I was overly excited about my bike ride; I always travel far forgetting that I still have to make that ride bike... Brilliant, I know--no need to tell me twice...    But it seems it will have to be back to the treadmill tomorrow b/c the news is forecasting storms--again...  Dang, isn't this darn state green enough??

      I was reading an "intellectual" free publication, entitled "The Rake", that is published monthly in Minnesota.  I finally sat down to read the many that I have picked up over the past few months, and found some articles of quite some interest.  This is probably one of the better free publications I have seen throughout my years.  However, like all "free" publications, it requires advertisers in order to pay for its printing and its distribution (not the mention the authors).  And I noticed, like in many other forms of media, several ads for dating services... Ugh  what has this world come to?  Seriously.  I see so many ads promising to find that "perfect mate"--that person that is going to complete you and make your life the joy it should be.  You fools!!  Being alone has seem to have become synonymous with being a spinster, a player, issue-ridden, or somehow unnattractive to others.  Why can't 'alone' just be that?  Alone.  Yes, sometimes, I do feel lonely, but that feeling is fleeting and it usually only occurs when I am unusually horny or extremely tired (when my emotions run high).  Being are so afraid of being along, and I must say that I am at times as well, but I have come to realize that only reason I feel this way is that society has done everything in its power to want me to feel this way...  Dating advertisements...  Dating games...  Wedding ring advertisements...  Wedding/dating "competitions"...  Why can't anyone realize that no "one" person is going to make you whole; that the only person to make you feel that way is yourself.  I know, some may not agree, and it is in their right to have their opinion, however wrong it may be... =)  There is money in "dating", in hopes that the relationship will flourish and ultimately lead to a wedding... Which of course brings out the big bucks...  Marriage, ugh, well that is for another time... another blog  Again, this is not to say that I don't go through those feelings of lonliness or have a desire to "be with someone", but I fight through those urges...  And with the boys, (yes boys, not men) that I have seen around here, fighting those urges becomes REALLY easy... =P  I am not ragging on guys, but in my short stint on this planet, I have yet to meet many "men" (besides my father)...  I say this b/c I was reflecting on my adult life and I cannot recall having very many male "role models" so to speak...  There have been a few, generally instructors in high school and/or college, but as far as the guys I have dated, though some of been great guys, I have yet to date any "men"...  But females sell themselves short, and put up with things they should never have to, just so they don't have to be "alone"... Of course this standard seems to be universal--put up with your partners vast shortcomings so you don't have to be "lonely"... Because of course, lonliness means sadness.... Oh, wo is me...  Ugh, make me gag...  Please, wake up people...  Realize, as I finally have (though it has taken me FOREVER) that life is for you...  It isn't all about sacrifice and making someone else happy (though the world likes to make people feel that it is), it is about making you happy first... And if you are not happy, how do you think that is going to reflect on your relationships with others?    I used to feel bad for those you ate alone... Or went to movies "alone"...  But now, I have come to realize why many are "alone"... And I have a great respect and admiration for the strength of these "loners"...

      As I told Kay and my daddy, I have finally decided to live life for me...  But the thing that scares me is not that I have made the decision, but that I do not no what it is I want...    And ever since I have made this decision, I never want to sleep...  I feel as if I have lost so much time and by staying up to all hours of the morning, I am going to make up this time...  Silly, I know...

      **sigh**Remember the dog days of summer?  Those warm nights made warmer being crunched into a Geo Metro (or some other unseemingly small vehicle) with your friends?  Ah, summer break...  High school...  Take me away please!!  So yeah, I go to Blockbuster and as I walk towards the store after having just parked seconds ago, I hear a nice **crunch**...  Imagine to my horror as I see two young ladies in their car having just backed into the front of my truck...  Does she not have any sense of depth perception?  I just turned and looked at her...  We looked at one another for what felt like an eternity, the driver with shock and fear in her eyes, and me exhausted from a long day, not wanting to deal with this... she pulled back into the spot she was parked moments ago...  I walk over to my bumper, slightly bruised, and the headlights were fine...  No biggy... The girl proceeds to get out of her car, I tell her 'don't worry about it, but please, please, don't back into it again and to PLEASE drive safely'...  So kind I am... I wish people had my heart when I was a new driver...    I did come to understand through this almost comical experience, why my parents were so concerned about me driving...  Kids think they are immortal, and to add to that stupidity, they compound it with their lack of experience...  Oy, kids these days...  =)  Do I sound like an old maid yet??  And as I was driving home, this kid at the stop sign could not make up his mind whether he wanted to turn or go straight...  I wanted to just ram him and help him make up his mind...  Cruel and violent I know...  But good grief!!  Was I this much of an idiot when I was that age??  I apologize to all the poor drivers that had to share the road with me...  My bad...

        "The man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent, and he is never bored, and life is only too short, and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness.&nbsp; He alone lives, while other people, slaves of ceremony, let life slip past them in a kind of dream." --Virginia Woolf

      When did our world become a place of insecurity?  When did it take gumption to take a walk around one's neighborhood?  When did I become aware of man's evil?    In this day and age taking a walk late in the day is never the brightest idea; however, my friend Missy had a strong desire to so as to work off all the energy that she had so late in the day.  I agreed to accompany her seeing that I was NOT going to let her take a stroll by herself.  We were nearly home when I spotted a vehicle drive by the residential road we were walking on and my instincts told me to be aware of this vehicle--that whoever (or whomever) was driving was not someone just taking a liesurely drive around the block.  We continued walking, only about 3 blocks from home, when I heard wheels turn on the gravel road (road is currently under construction so there is quite a bit of debris, which was to my benefit) and the headlights were now coming from behind us.  I knew it was the same vehicle and I told Missy; we were frightened, but we knew that we had to find a place to hide ourselves from the driver's view.  We hid behind a large shrub and watched as the headlights of the vehicle slowing drove past us, taillights then coming into view.  The driver was not that far down the road, but far enough for us to inch closer to our apartment.  We weren't positive if the driver was going to come around again or go around the block, but fortunately we made it home safely without having to find that out.    My heart was racing.  My heartbeat becomes even stronger when I reccollect what transpired last evening.  I told Missy that if she ever got the urge to take a walk, to make sure that there was a male friend with her, and if she cannot find a male friend awake at that hour, to pull out one of her workout videos and exercise until she is exhausted.    I did ask her if I overreacted (which I have a tendency to do), but she stated that I did the right thing, especially since she was not even aware that the car had turned around.    I dunno... I recall a car turning around and the driver's eyes slowing traveling over two young girls.  I recall finding an open garage and acting as if we resided at that home.  It wasn't even late--the sun was just setting.  I never wanted to feel that fear again, but I have, and the same rules apply--flee.  I've learned to trust my instincts and a good rule of thumb is that 'overreacting is better than not reacting at all.'  Those may have not been the exact words used, but something to that sense.    I hate that I have to be aware all of the time.  I hate that evil does exist.  I hate that I can not protect myself or those that I love all the time.  And I hate, most of all, that I have become aware that security does not exist in this world.

      I could die tomorrow.  I could die right now.  No, I'm not being morbid, I'm staged in reality.  With that in mind, shouldn't that give me the incentive to  live  every moment, shouldn't that impel me to create life in my rather monotonous world?  Shouldn't it?  Yet, I still hold on to that fear.  Fear of failure.  Fear of not having enough money.  Fear.  It's a deterrent.  It's an excuse.  I understand that money is an ugly necessity of life; however, I make the choice of how much I need to work and what work I choose and how I choose to spend the rest of my day.  My choice.    But life isn't just that simple.  Many a person try to tell me that if I want something I can attain it as long as I put in the work.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.  Life is not that simple.  Now, don't read this and assume that I am feeling sorry for myself, because I am not, I do not.  People are not born in the same environment, with the same amount of love, financial security, or opportunity.  "Bullshit."  I hear that often.  "Bullshit."  But how can I presume that someone born into a life of privilege will understand another's circumstance?  Another's position in the world?  Another's frustration with the hypocrisy of society?  Again, I must assert, that I am not feeling sorry for myself, and I am not using this as a crutch; I work my ass off, I do not blame others for my failures, I have a beautiful attitude towards my life and those in my life that contribute to its beauty, and I look forward to my future.  Yet, I do recognize that if my history were adjusted, if it was a youth of less hostility, that I would be in a different place.  I am here, and I will do the best I can, with the resources I have, to reach my goals.    That brings me back to life.  What have I done?  What is its purpose?  This--this can not possibly be it.  It feels like a waste--inefficient.  I always feel that I must 'do' otherwise I am just wasting oxygen.  Wasting my breath.  There are moments when I perceive a brilliant, sensible world and then I open my eyes and I see stupidity.  Shallowness.  People move, but yet, they still appear to be in a stupor.  It's scares me.  It scares me to think that I am one of these.  It scares me that I might become one of these.    "Live life to the fullest."  Who determines what a full life is?  Does it include the rest of the world?  Do we live just for ourselves?  If so, what is the purpose of society and community?  We only seem to lean on each other in times of crisis, and even then, it only lasts a few hours, a day at the most; otherwise, we pass one another without even a smile, without a gesture to acknowledge another's presence.    Were we supposed to end up this way?  Do we continue to live this way?  Do we teach future generations to live this way?  Do we change?  Can we change?     Life has little meaning if we don't include others.
