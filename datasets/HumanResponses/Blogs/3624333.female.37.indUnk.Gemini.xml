      The purpose of this meeting was to arrange for Dave's 40th b-day party. We are longgggg time listeners of WFMU the local free form radio.  And my gift to Dave was to get(hire) a DJ...so he doesn't have to "do" the music at his own party! I thought long and hard and asked for many recommendations from friends and colleges on who I should see/hire.  Then....one Friday afternoon...it hit me like a ton of bricks....My favorite DJ on FMU was playing some really wicked shit!  Could I ask him? I did.... and he does...do parties that is....and he likes good food....Beth and I cooked for him while He & Dave looked over our "stuff/vinyl". We had a mixed greens salad with gold and red beets, avocado, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, red and orange peppers, jicima, and chilpolte/ maple glazed Shrimp.  Then for dinner we made "Patagonian Snaggle(i added the snaggle part)tooth fish" seared with light dusting of curry pwdr. over mixed sprouts, in a infused coconut broth with cilantro oil.  Dinner was GREAT ! Company was GREAT!  Couldn't have asked for a more pleasant, intriguing, fun night!!!!!!  After having to deal with shit stains who roam the earth aimlessly...My faith in mankind is restored, after having met DJ Small Change AKA Jim Dier!  Thanks for a blast of an evening!

      Well my first rant will be about how my weekend started off with a face to face with my nightmare contractor Angelo Rella from All pro construction aka All Pro demolition in West orange, New Jersey.  They are listed in "Orange, N.J.".  I find out later that people who know him refer to him as "that crumb". I am the unfortunate neighbor, who suffered the consequences of all pros' incompetent work. What started out over 10 months ago quite amicably, ended with threats against my life... Anyone who reads this pls. never get involved with these ALL-PRO people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   But soon after that things got better...Saturday was the most beautiful day on the beach at Gunnison that I have ever seen in my 15 years going!  The ocean was a sheet of dark blue glass, and the sky was so clear that could see the parachute ride in Ocean Beach Coney Island.  The sea water is another story....ewww.  But then again, we don't really go for the water...LOL ;) It's Sunday now...and the BBQ is ready...ciao! Peace...
