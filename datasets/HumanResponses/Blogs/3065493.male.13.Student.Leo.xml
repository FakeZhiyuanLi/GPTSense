      Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am in 7th grade now. I go to school at NJIS. I hate math and I also hate English.  This is my first blog. I can play the piano. I am good at playing  Magic;the gathering  cards. So far, I have collected over  100  rare cards,  200  uncommon cards, and  50  common cards. I like to modify my deck. I usually played the pc version of the game.  I also like WWF cards. I am now still a beginner and I am stil learning the basic of the game. My starter deck now is  Eddie Guerero . This weekend, I am planning to buy the deck titled " Brothers of Destruction ".  I heard that it is a good deck.  I also play with my PS2.  I like the new games this year.  My favourite games are :  NFL streets, I Ninja, Onimusha 3, Metal Gear Solid 2 substance, and Dragon Ball Budokai 2.

      1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use? Yes, because with this technology, I could buy anything easily and I would not have to look for things. They will advertised the things you want for you.   2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this?  I think that the society is not ready for this because most people will not take it seriously and they don't know much about this technology.   3. What would be the benefits of this technology?  People could shop easily. They would not have to spend hours to look forn the things they want to buy. The chip could detect the things easily.   4. What could become problems with this technology?  Terrorist could kill a person with an important chip implanted in his body and used his chip inside his body to gain access to secret files.   5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology.  I think that this technology will be fine for some people. But others will want to stay the same by not accepting this technology.       1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  It could affect us because people will be watching us when we are eating, sleeping, talking, and walking on the streets.   2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair?  It is fair to have cameras installed on the streets, buildings, parking areas, stores, malls, and crowded places. I think it is not fair to install cameras in toilets, houses, and schools.   3. What is your opinion on this subject?  I think that this subject tells a lot about the technology around us. It also tells us how it could affect our lives.    4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats?  I thing that the governments should put more cameras on airports and streets. The more cameras the government install, the saver it will be. But we will get less privacy.
