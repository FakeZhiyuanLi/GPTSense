       Don't worry, I'm not in spandex. By the way, never ever give a spandex suit to a homeless person. That could result in loss of lunch. To add to yesturday's events, I went shopping. Now, it's harder than crap to find clothes because I seem to be the only one in the world who doesn't resemble the figure of a damn stick. All the designers have to adhere to the requests of all the anorexic teenagers. Anyway, I have to shop in the petites section of the store, which is a drag because lots of that stuff is nice but honestly I'd rather shoot myself than wear that crap to school. One shirt my mom passed to me looked disgusting but I tried it on anyway. If I gained 50 more pounds, added really red lipstick, and stuck a pillow up my pants, I'd look like my 7th grade science teacher. *shudder* But 	I found four really cool shirts. But the highlight of them is MY NEW HAWAIIAN SHIRT!!!!! My friends may kill me but I don't care. I'm in preparation for ALCON IV! LOOK OUT CHICAGO!!!! After everything I did, I hung out at Helen's (my best friend). We started work on our movie. Maybe we'll make money off of this. I certainly hope so. Always remember: Love is an attractive force. Like cake.o

       Well, my first "Weird Al" concert was 2 months and 13 days ago. I was browsing on the site and looked at the tour page. I was really mad that I couldn't go to the one down in Valdosta, Georgia last year. But I looked at the page with hopefulness, thinking maybe I'll be able to go. And then I saw it. April 22, Atlanta,Ga, The Tabernacle!!! I was so very happy. Now to tell the person who can drive me there as well as pay for the tickets seeing as I'm flat broke, MOM! She was happy with the idea and bought 2 tickets for her and me.Now this was in March and then it eased into April. On the morning of April 12th, the morning show anounced that Al's parents died. Of course being the stupid morning show people that they are, they made fun of it by saying that now Al's probably gonna do a parody about it. I thought that was really mean. It was very sad. I really felt sorry for him and then I also thought about how much it would suck to have the tour canceled. OY! But I thought that what would happen would happen and if it was that, so be it. But it would still reeeeaaaallllyy suck. I didn't check the site from that point because I had to "be good" and "make good grades" in order to go, so I wasn't on the computer much. But by the time April 22 had come around, I was surprised I could even pay attention to what my teachers were saying. I had also asked my mom if she could buy me a copy of Poodle Hat so I could bring it with me and possibly get it signed since my copy of Running With Scissors isn't really in the best condition. She had said maybe (the synonym of no) but later that day I found a ribbon hanging from my fan tied around Poodle Hat! I didn't have time to listen to it though because we had to leave very quickly. When we finally got there, The Tabernacle wasn't even open. People were sitting outside on the steps just talking with their friends and waiting. It was really cool watching all the die hards there. People wearing shirts from other Al concerts. When the doors opened, we flew in. It took us awhile to find the seats we were supposed to be sitting in but eventually we got it. Fifth row aisle. Those seats were friggin awesome! When the show was almost starting, a guy came out to do stand up. Oy, he was really bad. Wasn't very funny, his jokes were really lame but I think he did a good job anyway because you really have to respect people that do stand up because it's harder than hell to do. And then finally...it was time. Al came out with accordian and burst into Angry White Boy Polka. I took so many pictures from the opening sequence, it looks like a freakin flipbook! I'll scan as soon as I find out how to work the scanner. The show was amazing! If you've never been to a Weird Al concert, you should be taken aside and be doused in shaving cream! I got to cross out one of the things on the list of things to do before I die. I was so happy when he performed One More Minute because that was the song my best friend and I were going to sing the next week for the talent show (we didn't win but that's only because the judges really don't know what art really is). But the best part was when he sang Wanna B UR LOVR. He went out into the audience and up to people but he came up to me and sang! That was one of the best experiences of my life! We got a picture of it too (you can't see me in it so it looks like he's singing to somebody else but IT'S ME!). By the end of the concert, I was really sad that it was over. BTW, how do you get backstage passes? Because a heckuva lot of ppl had them. Anyway, since we couldn't go backstage, we found the tour bus outside. We went out, hoping that maybe Al was doing meet and greets. We saw the guys who were in front of us. They were pretty nice guys who took some really good pictures with a digital camera. They took a picture of us and we gave them my mom's e-mail. Unfortunatly, they lost the e-mail, I guess or something happened and we haven't heard from them. So after 2 months and 13 days we know their names were Chris and Allen (Alan) and they live in Alabama. They got to go to the concert in Valdosta and got Al to sign a Yoda doll. Allen (Alan- I have no idea how to spell it and I'm really anal about that) brought an ashtray from the Albuquerque Holiday Inn to get signed this time. I got the inside booklet thingy signed by Steve and Jim. About a week later, I read Al's letter about his folks. So I now knew why he wasn't out there signing stuff although that's what I thought about in the first place. Well, that's my experience. If you actually read all this, reply and tell about yours!

       Hope none of you got heartburn yesturday. Man, I feel like the whole tool rattling in Hardware Store with all the food I ate yesterday. I had *inhales deeply* potato salad, barbeque, cole slaw bread, punch, mint iced tea, brownies, pecan tassies (which are like mini pecan pies) and green combination of pistachios, marshmallows, coolwhip, pistachio jello pudding and pinapple. Wow. My stomach just increased in size just by reading that. Oy vey. Well, I plan to add more carbs by going to the movies to see SHREK 2!!! And I shall rate it!

       Okay. I've gone to the movies for the past two days. Based on this, I have made a huge decision: I must never, ever, EVER see another Lindsey Lohan movie ever again in my life. I love comedy, yeah, but after a toilet flush like Mean Girls, I can't take it anymore. I didn't find it funny at all. It was really bad. Right up there with Bubble Boy and My Boss's Daughter bad. So, if you plan to go see it, I guarantee you'll be much more happier and entertained if you sit in front of the toilet, toss in $6.50, and watch is as it flies down the porcelin(sp?) express. Today would have been the third day in a row. Mum and I were sitting on the couch and she goes, "Wanna go to another movie?" We looked through the times and stuff. We joked about going to see "The Notebook". A little note to everyone : If someone doesn't want to see that crappy "I-love-you-so-much-but-my- parents-hate-your-guts-and-you-don't-even-write-to-me-but-I-love-you-no-matter-what-anyone-says" cliché of a movie, please don't drag them into it kicking and screaming because I have a little inkiling that you will find your name on a hit list. I refuse to see that movie. Anyway, we didn't go out to the movies. We did something better: we stayed home and watched UHF!!!!! YAY!! UHF is an awesome movie jsut because it's Weird Al's.  So if you go to the movies, see something worth seeing (like Saved, which is very very funny) or stay home, pop your own popcorn and watch UHF.
