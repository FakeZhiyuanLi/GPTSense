      I am done. With blind dates that is. Have a frind that just set me up with her sister and it sucked . Great girl but i dont date women that are bigger than me. I dont get it. I have no problem with girls with a little meat on them, but good god. Know the thing that pisses me off is the fact that i was put in a situation to be an asshole. If would've been able to see her before hand i could've said no. So i met her last friday. A very nice woman, educated has traveled all over the world. She makes graet money. But she weighs more than I do. So, she goes out of town with her family for the whole weekend. The n on tuesday her sister calls me and say's "well what did you think". Now I tried to be very sensitive to the feelings of the women involved. But NO they have got to keep pressing me with questions. But I left it at no I am not interested. Shlould have ended there but NO. Th e next night the lady in question has to call me to say "when are we going to go have some fun", then tries to get me to go meet her family for dinner. Oh My GOD!!!! what the hell just happened. Well  the more Ithought about it the more it made me mad. Why would they put me in that situation. I thought women had better intuition than that. Anyway I end up going to my neices softball game, and guess whos there. Yes you guessed it. Well I didn' talk to her. I just sat somewhere else. Dammit what the hells going on. this is my first one I'll get better.

       Well I know i havent posted anytthing in awhile. Not much has been happening. Ive been sailing alot. Got a catamaran that just has been alot of fun. Well i met a young lady out at the lake. Very cool, likes to sail likes to ski likes to go on trips very adventurist. Well shes redheaded about 115 lbs with a very athletic body. thank god. But i am playing it kinda cool . I believe theres been alot of flirting going on and such. But you know what , i still dont know. She told my father about three weeks ago that she didnt date because her son threw such a fit every time she went out on a date. So i decided that i wouldnt even bother, and we would just remain friends. Because i really like her and would  like to keep her as a friend. She really is pretty cool, and i love the way she laughs. But i tell you what I believe she keeps dropping hints likke theres no tomorrow.. Man i dont know what to do. Sure would hate to lose her as a friend. But I sure would like to see her on a more intimate level. And i am not talking just about sex.  We went out saturday evening for one last sail of the day. Sun was setting in a brilliant ball of orange, the wind was light  it was perfect. And we talked and talked and talked some more. Thats what i am talking about. Look I am no puss. I like sex as much as the next guy , but i do believe that now that i am getting older thats not the only thing i am looking for.  I hope that this one goes better than the last one because , i am just about to give up.   I do know this though, if this ones goes south Ill wait till my sons gone to colleg or wherever he decides to go after school. I am leaving and going sailing around the world with or without a woman. Hell i'll pick some up along the way. One way or the other i am going. anyway i am done till next time.
