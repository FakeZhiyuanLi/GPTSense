       You may be wondering what I was doing this morning at 1 am posting a link to some blog about some people moving to an apartment in Australia.  The answer is... I don't know!  Well, I was not feeling well, and didn't feel much like sleeping. So, I was awake and wandering the internet in and out of blogg-dom.  I came across this blog that I found interesting so I posted it on my own blog.  It is kind of interesting looking at people's blogs.  It's kind of like high tech people watching.  And it is amazing that people will just let you into their lives like that... to follow what they are doing.  I wonder if anyone is doing the same to me?  It's fascinating isn't it?

       I have this urge to get to know my neighbors.  They are all in some way, shape or form going through some sort of a crisis.  These people are my friends and acquaintances, but I feel like I need to pour myself into them.  Actually I feel the need to pour Jesus' love out on them.    What do I mean by that?    We know some of them better than others.  Some we have over for coffee, or we will go and visit every now and then, but I think we need to go deeper. Like we are to try to form some more real, close friendships, and somehow help bring healing in their lives.  I believe that it is what I am supposed to do. So I am going to try.

       The memorial service for my little friend Cameron ( urlLink who I wrote about last week ) was yesterday afternoon.  Aside from my own father's funeral, this was probably the most difficult one I have been to.    There was a very moving photo and music presentation honoring Cameron's life, and his father Chris gave a eulogy that was probably the most beautiful and eloquent I have ever heard.  We will miss Cameron so much.  My oldest daughter is about his age. My wife teaches his Sunday School class, and we consider their family so close to our own. These will be hard days ahead.  But... We are looking forward to the day when we will see him in heaven and be there for the joyful reunion. That is our hope in times like these.  Again, please make sure you take the time today to let someone you love know that you care about them.  Grab hold of these opportunities before they pass you by.

        urlLink   Last summer I picked up a pretty fun hobbie called  urlLink geocaching .  Basically, it involves using a GPS to locate a certain location in which a treasure is hidden.  It's high-tech treasure hunting. I like it because it gets me out to places I would never have found on my own. Seems like the type of sport you really enjoy, or think is a waste of time, but if you have a GPS, I would recommend giving it a shot!

       9 1/2 hours working outside on the  urlLink new church building  today! In the pouring rain I might add!  Oh and it was only 41 degrees F.  So yeah, I spent the day cold and wet.    But we did get all of the trusses (is that how you spell trusses?) on.  I need to sleep!

       This is what a do for a living (currently)...  I take Quark documents and turn them into  urlLink this .  I say that I do this currently, because that is probably going to change.  My job as I know it is currently being shipped to India.  So, it remains to be seen what I will be doing a month from now, but for now this is what I do.  This is not something I always dreamed of doing.  It is just something that kind of happened.  People often ask me, "Do you like your job?", and I don't really know how to answer that.  It is something that I do, and I believe that God has used it to supply our needs.  I don't dislike my job.  It's just a job.  So, I do it.    What I really enjoy is people.  I enjoy ministry and reaching out to people. I enjoy relationships. Even though they can be a mess sometimes...  I would say that this is my calling, and I guess the best part about my job would be people.  That's what I do.

       I have one thing to request of all of you who read this...  Do you have kids?  Give them a hug and tell them you love them today.  Do you have parents?  Do the same.  Do you have a wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, best friend, anyone that you are close too??  Let them know how much they mean to you!  I compose this message with a heavy heart.  Some very good friends of mine lost their 4 year old son in a terrible accident yesterday afternoon.    It happened in an instant, and he was gone.    So I am begging you to please let someone you know feel the love that you have for them today.  And while you are at it, let them know that God loves them too!  You won't regret it.

The idea is that there are no real rules about how you use this blog, but please use it as much as you can. hmmm...

          My wife and I are going to try sharing this blog.  I have decided to separate our posts with some icons.  So... for the time being, if you see this:     You know that Martha posted this!   If you see this guy:     You know that Mike posted this!  I hope that makes it a little less confusing.    This should be fun!  :)

        Our church made the paper this weekend, and there was a picture of me printed under the headline.  (ok, I was about an inch tall, and you couldn't really tell it was me unless you read the caption...) But it was me none-the-less, and I feel really special about it.  Actually, it was a really nice story about our church.  I think you might like to give it a  urlLink read .  ( I especially like the last quote in the article by Chris Swanson.  Their family is dealing with the death of their 4 year old son last month, and he is still looking to reach out to others.  I see Jesus in them so much! )  In other news, I am trying to get my wife to sign up and contribute to this thing!  I would be so honored if she would, because I think it would add the missing dimension that this blog needs. Everyone who has read the posts so far has no idea that they are only hearing from half of me!  (by the way, I know that she will read this and feel so guilty about not doing it yet... :)...)   So, I think you will be hearing from her soon too!

        Seems that a lot of our friends have left town on vacation.  Some went to Mexico, some went to Montana, some are in Houston, and others are on a road trip south.  We are still here counting pennies, and holding down the fort I guess.    It is really quiet all the sudden though.  The phone isn't ringing as much, and we find ourselves wondering what to do with our time.  This weekend will be a quiet one too.  Which is quite alright with me!  Next weekend will be very busy on the other hand, so I guess I should enjoy it while it lasts.  And, maybe I could catch up on some projects around the house, or friends I havn't connected with in a while.  I have also decided that this blog needs more pictures.  The one in this post is of a summer sky near my home.  Looking down the avenue toward Lake Superior.

       I just want to update this while I have a couple of seconds to do so.  It has been a busy week or so all around.   Work has been nuts!  I have been trying to keep up with all the various projects, but I feel like as soon as I get one done, there are four more on my desk.  It really helps to raise the stress level, that's for sure.  Typically when I get done with work (usually late each day)I go home and have dinner, and then it is off to the next task.  Work on the  urlLink church building , have  urlLink cell group , meet to go over the church treasury...  Somewhere in between I spend time with my family, and find some time for myself.  Then I go to bed so I can wake up in the morning and go to work.  That pretty much sums it up for right now... that will calm down soon (I hope).  I had the opportunity to preach on Sunday, and I think it went well.  It has been a while since I last preached, so I brought a bit too much material to cover, but I got most of my point across.    "Receive your call from God, Step into that call, and Prepare to stand your ground."  I took the overview of the life of Nehemiah.  Cell group tonight!  We are planning a kick-off party for next week, so it should be fun!  Thats all for now.

       I had an awesome weekend!  First of all, this was the first weekend that we had good weather in a long time.  It has been rainy and cold for most of our spring.  But this weekend we had sun and 70's which is always good.    We got a lot done on the construction on Saturday.  We managed to get most of the windows in and it is starting to look a lot more like a building.  I really am enjoying seeing that all come together.  We had to let the Ballards know that we won't be able to go to MT with them this year. It is actually a load off my mind and heart now that the decision is finally made.  I would have liked to have gone, but for some reason, or many reasons, this year wasn't the year to go.  My wife and I celebrated 5 years of marriage on Saturday.  It is amazing how fast 5 years can go, and how much can change in that time.    So, here we are 2 kids later, looking back on the years we have had.  They were good years, and we accomplished a lot.  We learned a ton.  We loved even more.  Now we are looking forward to the next 5 and wondering what they will bring.  I want to finish my Berean studies within 3.  Martha is starting a new phase of ministry.  Our children will be 9 and 6, and who knows how many more will be here by then...  ...and those are just some of the things we think will happen.  I wonder more about what God has planned for us.    We will continue to follow Life HIS way!

       Had our first "real" cell group tonight (in my opinion).  I take that back! As far as that goes, I have found that real is how you see it... or what you make it.  So, I will say there was a significant change in the way cell group went this evening.  At any rate, we had a good discussion about Ephesians 6.  Specifically the part about the armor of God.  I could have talked all night, and I had a hard time holding back.  Man, I really enjoy being around a new Christian.  There are so many refreshing questions to think about.  It is weird how sometimes it is easy for me to forget to ask good questions.  Since when did get to the point where I have everything figured out?   I think I am slowly figuring out what my heart is yearning for through all of this.  I guess I am going through a time of wishing to be a bit more child-like in my imaginings of all things Christ-like.  Like... like... like...   In other news,  I am struggling over whether we should go with the Ballards to Montana in a couple weeks.  My heart is divided with my mind.  Part of me worries that we will not have the funds to do it, but then I have those moments where I feel that we really need to go... like right now as I write this.    Can someone just confirm this to me one way or another??  Well, I will sleep on it again...

       Well I let it go almost a week since my last update, and I can't believe it has been that long.  It is amazing how time flies!  What has happened this last week?  Not too much.  Work has been crazy busy.  I can't keep up with all I am trying to do, and I don't really know why.  I think I may be too much of a perfectionist sometimes. I have to try and find the balance between worrying about things being perfect, and letting them be good enough.  The family is doing pretty good.  Although, James managed to fall yesterday and gave himself a pretty nasty gash on his forehead.  Had to get 5 stitches!  (ouch!)  Well, I am at the end of my lunch break so...  off to work I go! :)

       So I will try to recap my weekend just for fun.  It was miserable weather for most of the weekend.  Cloudy and cold and just for kicks some rain and fog mixed in!  We went to the Ballard's house for dinner on Friday.  That was good.  We had a nice dicussion about the state of our church both Spiritually and emotionally.  We agreed that God is up to something and is drawing us together as a group.  It is so good to see how close we can become with God's love!   Saturday was a work day at the  urlLink new church building .  We got a lot of little stuff done even though it didn't look like a lot.  I am off to work up there again this evening.  Sounds like I will be hoisting bundles of shingles to the roof.  (oh joy!)  Sunday was church, which went pretty well.  The rest of the day we just hung out at home.   Monday was Memorial Day holiday.  I had a Company vacation day, so that was nice.  I just wish it was nicer out!   We went to a service put on by the local VFW post to honor the veterans who have died.  Then we went to visit the various grave sites of my family.  Later my family got together for ice cream.  It was a nice day.  Today I am back to work and swamped as ever!!! So, I better get to it!

          Today was kind of a blah day...  The events of the day left me with a bad feeling.    First thing I guess is that I am dealing with some relational issues right now that I am just not sure of.  It makes me a bit nervous.  Second, we found out that the  urlLink new building site  for our church was burglarized last night.  The thieves got away with about $1600 worth of tools.  I was shocked that someone would break into a church, but apparently there was another church in the area that had the same problem recently.  It is such a shame...   urlLink     picture of our new church building   Third, I went to work at the building tonight, and just have such a difficult time not having much experience building things for myself.  Does make me feel a bit out of my element.  I know that every little bit helps, but it makes me wonder how much helping I actually do, and how much hindering I do sometimes. (no one likes to have to teach people when they are trying to get things done...)  So, I guess if I were to just go by my feelings, things wouldn't be too good.  BUT, I am relieved to know that my feelings don't always echo the Truth.    The Truth is what I base my life upon!

         Well I do agree with Mike I do not like the new set up, I could not figure it out! But he finally showed me how to do it. Then it seemed like every time I had a thought to write, it was a bad time! My weeks have been pretty packed. With every day stuff to just getting out and finally getting to enjoy the weather.   Soooo.... about the bikkie thing....I knew that I should not have commented on that! Oh well. My Grandma is who started it and I suppose my mom just picked up on it. But the way I usually would hear the word bikkie's used was when my mom would say " I'm gonna spank those bikkie's!" So there you have it. :) Was it worth waiting for?   I'm off now to put kids to bed, till later!

I have included a pic of a rainbow that I took a couple months ago. A little dark, but a pretty interesting image I think.  I am just sitting here looking through various blogs I read and decided to add a couple to my blogroll...     urlLink Exploring Orthodoxy  (Ian's blog --  thanks for the comments and B-day wishes mate! )   urlLink  >>    urlLink spirit farmer    In other news, my geocache has been found!!!  urlLink Read about the missing cache here.  I guess some kid found it and brought it home to show his parents.  Once they finally got it open and realized what it was, they sent me an email.  They put it back together and want to see it replaced in it's original location!  I will have to find a rather stealthyway to hide it this time so it doesn't get "muggled"!  I am really tired now... so I sign off with that!

(which is a long time to a little girl!)  This is the first year that she has really been hyped up about the whole thing, so it has been pretty fun.  She is going to the zoo today with some friends.

         Well, I will let my wife explain that last post.  I guess her Grandma my have started an alternate definition of the word bikkies.  Anyway, time to move on with this blog into other topics I think.   President George W. Bush will be in my hometown of Duluth tomorrow. I think that is pretty exciting!  It is not every day that you get to see the President of the United States in your city.  Although, I think there was more excitement over the visit of Senator John Kerry a couple of weeks ago. This part of the U.S. happens to be a fairly liberal area demographically.  The fact that we do have both Presidential candidates come through in the election year is pretty interesting though.  It also makes for some interesting conversations around the water coolers as well.   I was just thinking that it is amazing how quickly 4 years has gone by since Bush was elected. My daughter (my oldest child) is turning 4 on Wednesday as well.  Time is just flying by, and it is causing this desire in me to savor every moment.    I am realizing more these days... actually since my last birthday that I have a lot of things to accomplish in my remaining time here on earth.  Things that I would like to see accomplished that I also believe God wants to see accomplished in me.  We watched a video this evening of a sermon preached a couple of weeks ago by Pastor  urlLink Bill Johnson  of  urlLink Bethel Church  of Redding, CA.  The message was about taking up and reclaiming "lost mantles" of the spiritual fore-fathers, and receiving the inheritance that has already been given to us.    I am still mulling it all over in my mind, but somehow it has inspired me to look at the last few years of my life and take stock of where my heart has been.    I am excited to see what God is going to do with this, because I can feel something happening within my heart.  I believe a change is coming again!  Oh boy!!  ;)

         I must say..... this blogging is starting to catch on with me. That is usually how it goes, it takes me awhile to get into somthing, but once I do I find I like it.  To comment on the bikkies thing...I have heard of that word before, actually my mom used it quit a bit when I was little. Only in a different manner. I'll just leave it at that. I am sure I will be questioned by my husband when he reads this! Till next time.....

         It seems that a comment I recently made on another  urlLink blog  has touched off  urlLink a bit of discussion (and  urlLink here ) in the blogosphere.  I have been visiting  urlLink James and Elicia's Adventures in Australia's Winter Wonderland  ever since  urlLink I first blogged  about it in May.    The other day, I was reading through and came across the word  urlLink bikkies ...  what?  You read it right,  urlLink bikkies !  As in:   "when she arrived home she carried beer, sausage rolls, a jam donut, cheese and  bikkies  and chocolate"  (emphasis mine)    I have never heard of this word before... so call me uncultured... but I had to find out. Bikkies by the way are biscuits.  Who knew?!?!  I don't know, I think it is pretty interesting.  Why is this cool you ask?  I guess for me it still boggles (or should I say "bloggles") my mind how communication has changed these days.  I can sit in the comfort of my own home and read posts that someone has written from half way across the world.  (I don't want to sound too old fashion, but I am a child of the '80's afterall...)  I also find it fascinating that there are so many differences in cultures that seem so much the same.  Something as simple as the language can set us apart, and heaven knows that there are probably more complex cultural differences that we could talk about at great length.  But, as I read through this  urlLink blog  I am drawn to the similarities in the human experience.  Without getting too deep, I think if you read through you will find the same thing.  Somehow I make a connection with these people from another continent just by reading what they have to say.  As I have said before, it is fascinating to me!  I am also amazed that my beautiful wife has finally decided to join me!!! :)

         Well it has taken me weeks, as my husband has said, to sign in and actually right something. And by the way he did not have to bribe me to do it. I just finally have the time to sit for a second and add my thoughts. Which to tell you the truth are kind of scattered at the moment and a little pre-occupied. We've had a very busy holiday weekend, and I am trying to get everything back in order. I think I am about there. So hello to all of you, and sorry to you mike that I have taken so long. Bless you all!

         I am really good at opening those cans...  I think that I have done this a few times lately.  Once for sure at work, and I think I may have done so with other relationships lately.  It seems like a combo of misinformation and bad timing have gotten me.  (That and the fact that sometimes I can't leave well enough alone...)  What a mess it leaves me in, but every once in a while, it turns out to be a good thing.  Who wants to keep a can of worms anyhow? Isn't it better to open up and let them out so they can be dealt with properly?  Well, that is my philosophy anyway...  Things are good here as far as Life goes!  I couldn't ask for much more.    I do keep trying to convince my wife to blog, but it doesn't seem to be working. I have asked, begged, guilted... about the only thing I haven't done is bribed.  Well, it will happen one of these days.  She is just keeping us in suspense!

          Well, we had a great time this weekend.  It was good to have some time off to do whatever we wanted.   Just a basic recap... we went up to the lake Friday and Saturday, and spent Sunday and Monday at home. I think that Sunday was the most relaxing day of the weekend.  We went to church that morning and had a picnic right after, and then we just spent the day at home.  It was great!  The weather was pretty miserable though!  Friday was really the only nice day of the bunch.  Saturday was HOT in the morning, and rained in the afternoon. Sunday and Monday were cloudy and cold with off and on rain. It seems like we have only had a handful of nice days this summer so far.  Last night we went out to watch the fireworks (they were postponed Sunday because of rain)!  I was a good show, and the kids loved it!

         I need a vacation very badly! I am taking tomorrow off work, and we are going up to the lake for a couple of days.    Maybe do some fishing or swimming with the kids.  Enjoy the summer sun!    It is going to be great!  But it also means that we will not be updating the blog at all (for a few days anyway...).  Of course we will be celebrating Independence Day this weekend, so there will be a lot going on.  Hopefully we will have a few pics to share when we get back.

         I heard about this site in an email newsletter that I get regarding internet evangelism.    urlLink Forgiven   I was a bit surprised by the site a first because I was expecting a Christian evangelism site, but it is more of a marketing/$$$$ making site in the name of Christianity.    I personally have a hard time with that.  I do not question the beliefs of those who run this company, but I wonder if it is the best idea to try an earn a living off of marketing to Christian youth... (I am trying to work out why this bothers me...)  Maybe because in Jesus' day there were those who saw opportunity to make $$$$ off of those coming to the temple to worship.  And we all know what Jesus' reaction was to that.    Now in that particular case, I believe that the people involved were preying upon a need of the people to exploit them by charging unreasonable prices.    I guess it is the age old question of commercialized Christianity.  We know that the first church did not operate this way.  Is it right for us to do so?  I feel better about charging money to defray the costs of ministry, and I don't have a problem with accepting donations to offset the costs of living in full-time ministry...  but is it alright if we focus on leveraging our "Christian" calling to make a buck?  Again, I do not want to disparage this company unjustly, and honestly, it is really not up to me anyway to cast any judgment.  I am just working these things out for myself.  What do you think??   P.S. I do like the idea of using new ways to share the Gospel.  I think that Mobile Media is the next big thing... (like the internet in the 90's)... and I think that the church can use this media to show people the  Love of Jesus Christ .

          Can you say cold and rainy?  That is what it has been for the last couple of days.  So I decided to add a little script that I saw on  urlLink this blog .  I just might take it down soon though.  I see enough rain outside.  Let me know if it is too annoying. :)  If you like the script, you can find it  urlLink here .

          To add to mike's thoughts! That night was a true summer evening in my book! We really had a blast. I do feel a little guilty about Mike's injury seeing as I am the one who talked him into going! oops!!!   Our frineds live on a hobby farm, so there was alot of room for the kids to run(of course it did not stop them from running through the vollyball court!) And good food, fellowship and beautiful weather. A perfect night~  (Well exept for Mike's injury, and the fact that I woke up the next morning with a sad relazationg I am getting old! Man was I sore!!) No LAUGHING now!  Well.....till next time~

         It has been over a week since my last post?!?!?  What is going on?  I will skip ahead to the weekend, because not a whole lot happened last week. I will just say that my last post caught me in a bit of a bad mood. I worked through most of that just fine.  We were able to get out and have some fun and relaxation this weekend. Saturday I worked at the church for half the day, and that evening we went to the beach and had a picnic with some friends.  Sunday came along, and church was great.  We had a good potluck after the service as well. Now I am not necessarily a fan of potluck, but our church seems to put them on pretty much once a month.  I do enjoy the conversations over a meal with friends.  It is funny how potluck will vary from time to time as far as the quality of the food goes.  We have had some great ones, but then again, every once in a while, there is a really bad one.  I think the last potluck we had was one of those bad ones.  There was a whole lot of mushy hotdishes, and for some reason, they all pretty much tasted the same.  So, this one was much better by comparison. There was good variety, and the ingredients were either better or fresher or both.  Later Sunday evening, we went to our friends' house to play volleyball. There were quite a few people there, and we had a blast!     I must say that I should have read the  urlLink comments on this volleyball post  before we started the third game.  I enjoy volleyball, and though I am not a pro, I like to think that I can play.  Put it this way, I can play pretty well with the people that I usually play with.    Well, we were pretty well into our third game.  Our team was way ahead at that point.  We were in the middle of a pretty good volley, when the ball happened to be set to the player playing opposite me at the net.  I had in my mind to make a great block, so I jumped into the air.  (of course, I missed the block...) I was just thinking to myself, "how did I miss that?" when I landed.  Then I heard (and felt) a *pop!*... *snap!* emanating from my left knee, and actually felt my knee bend sideways.  This is not something that is supposed to happen and trust me it feels very unnatural when it does.(it was downright PAINFUL!)  The first two thoughts through my head were "Ouch!", and "I hope I don't need surgery!" (in that order)...   So "knee-dless" to say (very puny!), that was the end of my volleyball for the night (and probably the rest of the summer...), but we did get 3 games in before hand and we got to stick around to roast marshmallows and have s'mores.  So, all in all we had a great time!    I guess I am also learning to use crutches for the first time, too.  Not that I really wanted to, but hey, you have to make the most of it, right?  Now I just wish I could heal a bit faster...
