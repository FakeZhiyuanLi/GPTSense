      So tonight was very interesting.  First, my friend, Nick, came over and ended up elbowing me in the lip so now i have very sexy ;) Angelina Jolie lips... not quite as nice as hers... but mine have a pretty blue tint. lol I went riding around with Nick a little later... cuz that's pretty much all there is to do here... and we ended up sitting by the lake in his truck looking up at the stars... our nights together usually end up like that.  It was nice... semi-peaceful... but filled with tears as always.  Oh the trials that high school sends us through. ;)

      Insecurities fade, inhibitions gone Another lonely day is done. Eyelids droop, stars begin to shine Moonlit, all is divine. Shadows dance and time stands still With dreams my head fills But sooner than I want, light dances 'cross my face, I'm covered with light's warm embrace. A bird sings as the world begins to bloom. My day will be happy- I get to see you.

      Solemness settles on us like a thick dust Singling us out more and more Though we try and fail to get out, we must find a way; there has to be another door. But everytime you tell me it was my fault- everytime you blame I get pushed further from my goal and towards shame I want so badly to be happy and not care That feeling would be so rare. The load I'm carrying is breaking me down I feel as if I may sometimes drown in the same tears you've made me cry.  So many people hurt and I no longer wish to be part of that group. Make me the outcast I'm destined to be. Sometimes I feel as if I'm just wasting peoples' time for being around. I wonder, if I were lost, how long would it take for me to be found? It would be a blessing to be forgotten- left behind To be lost in a crowd as well as in my mind My thoughts confusing myself and others So why be around; why bother? How did it come to this again? I'm falling and I don't know when I'll hit ground I'm afraid by the time it's over I'll be too far down I'll have no time to change your opinion- it's already been made, So, into the darkness I will fade...

      Perfection in this world is so fabricated- false Everyone yearns for it Imperfection holds all Beauty is unique Beauty is unattractive.

      Too many years have I cowered with fear With no one to turn to- no one to hear Or comprehend when they do pay attention But I, myself, am too meek to mention The I too have feelings and I too am torn Expressing my feelings would feel strange- forlorn For I am always the happy one, cheerful with a smile Even though I am hurting all the while So quick to judge and slow to familiarize They'll never see life through my eyes. Rejection is so clear to me, all they see is my open personality I will remain who I am and be who I will be For no one can change the past, but the future is under our command Although we don't realize the duty that is at hand We need not criticize or judge If only we could all just stop, learn and love The world would become a much better place to live While we too would grow and learn to give Without expecting compensation Just help others through their tribulation We all know that sometime you'll need the help of another So how about helping out your brother? Giving and receiving is not always physical, though it's how it seems It can also be emotional, as in listening to someone's hopes and dreams. If only we'd listen to others instead of spending the time thinking of what next to say Our world would become closer and more friendly day after day No one seems to know anyone else because consideration in this time is gone Soon enough there's no one to turn to because no one understands If only they'd sit and soak it in... maybe even hold your hand Everyone needs someone to help coach them through certain periods of their lives We need to make the effort before all kindness dies.

      I'll be posting lots of poetry on this... so get ready.  A lot of it will probably sound contradicting, but feel free to criticize them.

      I write lots of poetry.. and this is one my most recent ones.  Mirage  Never-ending starlight eternal glistening bliss Blue dusk of moonlight During the day I miss the calm serenity of night the mysterious quality of the dark The sweet lucious absence of light brings us to the journey on which we'll embark. Your loving nature brings me close I gently grab your hand You- the one whom I care for most- are taking me through forbidden land. One touch leads to a hug, which in turn leads to a kiss This moment I hope will never end My heart jumps as we enter the abyss Things move slowly and tenderly we blend My first experience with such lust -the epitomy of your heart- I turn to tell you- I feel I must- that I love you and hope we'll never part but as I turn to face you, your image disappears Frightened I blink and as I do so- lights all of our surroundings, too, disappear all but one thing- light I search for your face- your body But no one is there I seach for all familiarity but all I find is air. Awonken and shaken I begin to relalize the romantic evening never existed the face, body, emotion and deep eyes normally something not easily dismissed merely a dream hidden behind a romantic disguise, Such a pity- you were merely a          Mirage.

      In my town, people who cut wheat (aka Wheaties) have a bad name.  You see, in the past, some of them have come to town and had sex with a lot of people... and just left, with no committment.  My parents have always warned to stay away from the "wheaties"... I've lived a sheltered life.  But this year, for some reason, my friend and I talked to a couple of them.  One, named Brenton, was extremely cute... and sweet and everything i've ever looked for in a guy.  He and I are now together despite him leaving to continue with his job.  We talk on the phone 2 or 3 times a day... and he'll be back through in about 5 months... I just thought i'd tell ya about him. :D
