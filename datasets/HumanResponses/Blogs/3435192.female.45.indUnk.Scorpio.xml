      As I mentioned in my earlier post, I got up earlier than usual because I just had the urge to. I think the heat forecast had a lot to do with it, because I didn't want to be out running around later in the day. My 1990 Honda Civic Si's a/c isn't working; it just blows hot air. On a 90-degree day, that's just like adding more fuel to the fire, and that's something I certainly don't need. I turned on the air conditioning in the house about seven o'clock or maybe a little bit earlier.  I've discovered the joys of sleeping without a stitch on except my panties; it feels so good to feel the sheets sliding down my bare shoulders and stomach. It's most definitely a lot more comfortable as well. Before, when I wore pj's, I'd frequently wake up in the wee hours of the morning all hot and sticky with sweat, and have to toss the covers off to dry out. No more; I sleep a lot more soundly now. I'm not sure I'll continue the practice when the days turn nippy. We'll see....  I've also discovered how good it feels to walk around the house totally naked, especially after a shower. It has nothing to do with my sexuality; it's just a natural state of being and makes me feel light as air and carefree, as if a heavy yoke had suddenly been lifted off my body. I'm not an exhibitionist, nor do I go about flaunting my body. Hell, my body isn't perfect, nor do I want it to be. There are too many boringly, perfectly sculpted, scantily clad female bodies parading around in public already. Imperfections, in my opinion, are far more interesting. They give individuals  character . Just look at Barbra Streisand's famous nose, for example.. now that  IS  character!  I feel totally comfortable and at ease in my own skin, more than enough to stand before a man without shame or embarrassment. This may not be true, but I think a lot of women my age have learned to accept their imperfections and reveal them without cringing or blushing; those in the 18-30 age group are still grappling with feelings of inadequacy about their T's and A's. Perhaps the same is true of men with regard to their equipment as they get older?  I clearly remember my first year out of college, when I rented a little bitty house in Maryland with three other women. One of them was a dirty blond-haired Philly bitch with pencil-thin lips and green (or were they blue? I don't remember) eyes that seemed to be constantly narrowed in a suspicious or angry gaze. She had this patently false air of sophistication and insisted that she be called "Nancois" instead of Nancy. What did she think she was, some wealthy expatriate strolling the boulevards along the Seine, wearing the latest and greatest from, say, Chanel or Yves Saint-Laurent?? I don't know what it was, but she certainly had an attitude problem.. her attitude was that she was superior to me and I hated her with a passion. We fought constantly during the year we shared that little house. I was never so glad as when we all parted ways at the end of the lease, I'll tell ya!  Besides her snooty and imperious attitude, there were some things about Nancois that really rubbed me the wrong way. One of them was her habit of promenading around the house stark naked, and believe me,  that  was NOT a pretty sight. Her tits were pendulous and swished back and forth across her protuding belly like windshield wipers. And I couldn't tell the difference between the business end of a Mack semi and her ass; it was that wide. What's more, it looked like there were bags of oranges under her skin, it was so dimpled and pockmarked by cellulite. Ugh.   Which makes me wonder HOW in the world she seduced a 15-year-old boy from the house directly opposite ours; it certainly wasn't her body that got him into her bed. Maybe she plied him with booze and weed; those things certainly would be tempting to a growing boy anxious to taste forbidden fruit. The next morning, our landlord showed up and wanted to speak with all of us, and so one of us had to go and wake Her Imperial Highness... that's how I discovered her crime. She and the boy were asleep and naked on her mattress. I wish to God that I had known then what I do now: that having sex, consensual or not, with a minor constitutes statutory rape and is punishable by law in most states. It would have given me the most immense satisfaction to report her to law enforcement and let the justice system have its way with her, in revenge for the months of misery she heaped on me. What sweet justice that would have been! But I was a naive 25-year-old fresh out of college back then, with a lot to learn about the outside world.  Nancois' shenanigans didn't stop there with the teenage boy. Another incident occurred in the house which made me wonder about her true orientation. I had my bedroom down in the basement which was ideal because it afforded me considerably more privacy than the others, with my very own bathroom. It also provided a refuge from Her Imperial Nastiness. One morning, I got dressed and came upstairs into the kitchen to get my breakfast, but stopped in my tracks right there in the doorway.   I could not believe what I was seeing at the kitchen table: Nancois, in all her ugly naked glory, sitting with two other equally naked women whom I had never seen before in my life, all unabashedly chatting away while slurping down juice and soggy cereal or whatever. Nancois breezily introduced me to her friends (lovers? As in a menage a trois?), but I was too shocked to say anything beyond a mumbled "Nice to meet ya". They seemed as unconcerned as she was about their total lack of clothing; they certainly didn't seem to care about the effect they might have on other people in the household. I got my breakfast as quickly as I could and beat a hasty retreat to my downstairs refuge away from the naked party.   Now, don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against homosexuals or bisexuals. As a matter of fact, I've had several good friends who were gay; one of them taught me sign language before I went off to college in Washington, DC and we became very good friends. But I don't like to see people, gay or straight, flaunting their naked bodies for all to see. What Nancois did was an affront to my sensibilities and sense of modesty. It was almost as if she was saying, "Haaaaaah! I don't care if you're offended or not, there's not a damned thing you can do or say about it!" She certainly never had the courtesy to ask me or my other roommates if they would be offended by her promenading around in the altogether. Like I said, it feels good to be free and unfettered by clothing, but there's a time and place for that -- most definitely NOT in front of one's housemates! There's much to be said for modesty still in this day and age......

      I woke up quite early this morning, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. I knew from looking at the three-day forecast on my MSN WristNet Fossil watch that it would be a scorcher today, and I wanted to get any outside errands done early.  There's a certain freedom in being unemployed, in that I'm not beholden to a company, employer, or schedule. I certainly miss having a paycheck, but the job I have, I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. My job for the past three years has been taking care of my mom, who's had had a series of surgeries (two spinal fusions and a recent one to open and drain an abscess near her spine). I do all the shopping, pharmacy runs, cooking, laundry, chauffeuring, housekeeping, bill paying, animal care, lawn maintenance, and so much more.  The big payoff is being able to spend lots of quality time with her, and that's very important to both of us. We've always stuck together for better or worse all through the years and are the best of friends. Right now she's in the rehab unit of a nursing home getting post-op wound care and physical and occupational therapy. Hopefully she'll be home in about another two weeks, but it hasn't been easy for either one of us. Let's face it, the entire three years that we've lived in the little yellow house (I love it) with the dark green shutters has been on the worse side than the better, as it's been a rough road for her recovering from the spinal fusion surgery nearly two years ago. What makes it even harder is the fact that I've had to shoulder 99% of the burden, without help from either one of my two brothers.  One of them lives in California, so it's understandable that he's unable to offer any real help beyond the emotional support, which has always given my mom reason to keep going. But the other brother, who lives with his wife and two boys nearby, just doesn't go out of his way to help our mom. Of course, he's visited her in the hospital and so on, but he's too busy to come out to the house and undertake small jobs around the place. He's got plenty of money but is too tight-fisted with it to help my mom out. Actually, his wife is the tight-fisted one. Since he's out of town every week, she pretty much wears the pants in the family and has veto power over money matters. I remember that when we moved to this house, my brother promised my mom he'd buy her a new stove to replace the one she was compelled (by him) to leave behind. Three years later, we're still using the same old stove that was left by the former owners...and I'm quite certain that my sister-in-law had something to do with it.

      Late last night, after tucking my birds into their cages and giving the pugboys their bedtime snacks, I took off for the local Borders bookstore and snagged the only copy in stock of the animated feature, "The Triplets of Belleville". I popped the DVD into my G4 Cube's 'toaster slot' and had a blast watching the movie on the Cinema Display's expansive 20" screen. Way cool. It was past 1 AM when the movie ended but it was worth it. I needed some comic relief after having a heated exchange with this jerk who had come to turn off the power, and seeing Smarty Jones get blown away by Birdstone in the Belmont Stakes.  Boy, did that hurt, seeing Smarty get beaten when I thought he had it. Watching it, and replaying it in my head, I knew, however, he was in trouble when he took the lead too early under pressure from Rock Hard Ten and the other horses. Why didn't Stewart Elliot take a hold of him at that point and pace him, so that he would have enough juice in the final stretch to hold off any late-surging challengers? Whatever the reason for Smarty's loss, it was still heartbreaking, especially after such a decisive win in the Preakness. I really, truly thought this WAS the year the 26-year Triple Crown drought would come to an end with Smarty Jones.   It's such an elusive prize, winning all three races. I've been following the Triple Crown for as long as I can remember, way back when Riva Ridge was running as Secretariat's stablemate and even before that. To see Secretariat blow away the competition by thirty-one lengths in the 1973 Belmont Stakes was a thrill I'll never forget; I remember I cried even before he breezed under the wire. I also remember my stomach clutching and my entire body trembling with nervousness and excitement when Affirmed barely stuck his nose past Alydar at the finish in 1978 to win it all. That for me was the equivalent of Muhammad Ali's "Thrilla in Manila".  Now that I've had the benefit of a few hours' sleep and time to reflect, I've realized that losing the Belmont doesn't really tarnish Smarty Jones' luster. Only time will tell whether he deserves to be remembered as one of the greats right up there with Secretariat, Seattle Slew, Affirmed and Man O'War. Who knows what he'll accomplish later in his career, perhaps the Breeders' Cup? At the very least, I think he's the Seabiscuit of the 21st century, a hero the public needs to believe wholeheartedly in, during this dark time of war and chaos.   I know something that would truly turn the horse racing world, the sports media and general public on their collective ears: a filly sweeping all three races. Yes, I said a  filly , and not a colt... isn't it about time a female showed the boys what she can do and wear the jewels of the Triple Crown in her mane? I will tell you right up front, I'm no militant slogan-spouting feminist. But I on occasion like to see members of my sex give the guys a good trouncing and take them down a notch or two -- whether it be in politics, sports, technology, or whatever -- and remind them that they're not always the stronger sex at the same time.  Most people in horse racing circles would say the very notion of a female Triple Crown winner is unimaginable, simply because they're regarded as not being as strong as the colts and therefore not as fast, which is the same general mindset also when it comes to the male and female homo sapiens. No wonder the sexes are almost always segregated in sports, even the racehorses. I'm not saying that we should start recruiting women to play in the NFL or anything like that. But when it comes to horses, I'd like to see more fillies and mares competing against the colts. Entering the fillies in their own races is, to me, a ridiculously outdated premise, especially when one considers that the combination of technology, better equine care, highly selective breeding and well-orchestrated training/conditioning programs have created stronger, sounder and faster racehorses of both sexes.  I really think it's a possibility. Three fillies in the past century have been able to beat the boys at their own game in the Derby: Regret, in 1915, and more recently, Genuine Risk and Winning Colors. The one filly I truly believe could have pulled off such a feat as to win the Triple Crown was Ruffian. Remember her? She was a huge and fast girl with a fiery spirit who won the fillies' Triple Crown as a three-year-old and ran only one race against a colt, Foolish Pleasure, which turned out to be her final race as well. Her fatal flaw was having been endowed with incredibly thin and fragile legs. She shattered a leg during the race and had to be euthanized after coming out of anesthesia, when she thrashed about so much and caused even more damage to the injury. In an eerie set of circumstances, both her sire and dam came to the same tragic end after breaking their legs, exactly one month apart in 1977. I think that if Ruffian had had sturdier legs, she very well could have beaten not only Foolish Pleasure in that ill-fated match race, but other colts in subsequent meetings.  I say to the fillies, "You go, girl!"
