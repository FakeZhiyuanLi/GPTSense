      I've been noticing recently the distinct lack (at least round where I live) of the toothbrush moustache. Looking back over what limited historical records I possess, it seems that the second half of the twentieth century has seen a general dearth of this form of facial hair. This is a great disappointment to me. Can anybody suggest a reason for this strange phenomenon, or does anybody have one? Or know someone that does?

      A friend of mine works as an estate agent and recently had to value a house belonging to a family of Mormons. Nothing strange about this, in itself. However, before he left the office he was told various things about the adherents of the religion, something he himself knew little about, which left him puzzled and slightly apprehensive. One of his co-workers told him about the polygamous nature of many of the relationships, another of the fact that they like to live in detached houses - so that evil spirits could not enter through the walls. He didn't know whether this was true or not, but chose to believe much of it and remember to watch his step in the house for fear of annoying potential customers.   Arriving at the house, he rang the doorbell. the door was answered by a woman, who, inviting him into the house, requested that he did not tread on the top step leading up to the door. My friend marked this down as another of the strange customs the Mormons had. Entering the house he was assaulted by eight children, "no surprise if they have a polygamous relationship," he thought. Progressing round the house, he viewed the dining room, kitchen, hall, bedrooms and finally the bathroom. Leaving this final room, he left the door open behind him, thinking nothing of it. "Please can you keep the bathroom door closed!" Came the somewhat abrupt request from the lady of the house. "Of course," thought my friend, "if the evil spirits can come through the walls, they must come up through the sewers as well!"  Sitting back down in the lounge, my friend ran over his valuation of the house with the owners. They seemed please and decided that they would advertise using his firm. On his way out, my friend decided that in the interests of seeming to provide a professional service, he would make some discreet enquires as to any other little rules they had.  "I understand that you are Mormons," he said.  "Yes."  "Well, I was wondering if there were any other religious rules you would like us to follow when we bring people on viewings of you property." "Other rules?" Asked the lady. "Yes. On top of avoiding the top step and keeping the door to the bathroom closed." "Not really," replied the lady, "keeping the bathroom door closed is just one of my personal things, and we painted the top step this morning - so I would have though it would be dry when you bring round the next lot of people!"

      Stopping by the cash machine on my way to work this morning, I experienced quite a weird exchange - I guess should have expected it though, working in the King's Cross area as I do!  I walked up to the machine, in goes the card, press the button for twenty pounds - everything going normally. As I was pulling out the money, however, I felt somebody move up very closely behind me. I'm not really one to be that bothered by the majority of things in London, but recently there has been so much on TV that I couldn't help the first thing that crossed my mind being that somebody was about to nick my card. When I turned round though it was this rather, well, how should I put it, "worn-out" looking woman. She opened the conversation (one I wasn't all that interested in having I must confess):  "D'ya want some sex?" "Not really, thank you. It's seven thirty in the morning!" "Come on...It's only a tenner" "A tenner? Fucking blatantly not then!"  I'm not the kind of person who would ever sleep with a prostitute. Though if I ever did, I like to think at least I would have the self esteem to use an expensive one!   I realise this little episode is probably not that strange, for London in general and particularly King's Cross. I found it pretty funny though - I mean 7.30am? Is there normally a roaring trade at that time on the morning? I guess that's just what crack does to you.

      When I went out for my lunch today, I stood for a few moments opposite the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras station. This has always been one of my favorite London buildings and I try never to miss an opportunity to stand and stare. Unfortunately, at the moment, some of the frontage is covered in scaffolding and tarpaulins - overall though, the effect is still incredible.  One of the things which I find most interesting about the building is the background of the man who designed it, and his family. Here is a quick breakdown of the main designs George Gilbert Scott and his grandson Giles were responsible for:  George Gilbert Scott: -Midland Grand Hotel (St Pancras Station) -Albert Memorial (Hyde Park) -Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Whitehall)  Giles Gilbert Scott: -Battersea Power Station -Bankside Power Station (now Tate Modern) -Liverpool Anglican Cathedral -Waterloo Bridge -Red telephone boxes (hence the rather confusing sight of an old red telephone box in the crypt of Liverpool Cathedral!)  This is only a short and very incomplete list for each of them - but not a bad family effort really! Apparently Giles' father was also an architect, but I unfortunately haven't been able to find much information on major works by him.   Apparently the Midland Grand is also supposed to be one of the most haunted buildings in London. I'm going on a tour round it soon, so might be getting some first hand experience of that...

      Having just exorcised a little of my annoyance with work in my last post, I expected just to get my head down and try and make the rest of the day pass as quickly as possible. Work, however, had different ideas.   Every year we have a "boat party". Big boat, lots of free booze - drunken employees and their guests spending the night driving up and down the Thames. Given the disparity between the size of the company and the size of the boat, tickets are normally at a premium. This is why, upon receiving the email announcing the date of the party and the release of the tickets, I emailed very quickly to reserve two for myself. No problems so far.  Yesterday an email arrives - tickets are now ready for collection. Great. I popped in to see the person this afternoon.  "James, isn't it," she said.  "Yes," I said.  "Here you go."  "Er, there's only one ticket here..." "That's what you asked for." "No it isn't, I wanted two." "No, one." "No, two."  And so on, ad infinitum. The main result of the matter being that I now have one ticket to the boat party, and am on "standby" for a second. Despite the fact I have an email from the person concerned telling me that two were reserved (I forwarded this email again and the person simply ignored it - god I love the kind of people I work with). So I am left with the choice of either letting down the person I was supposed to go with (not that they will be that bothered, but it's the principle) or going on my own. Great!  Very petty, I realize, reading back over this. As I say above though, it's the principle. I haven't even had an apology, which would go a long way.

      The main thing I have noticed today is how repetitive and boring my job is. I'm sure that this is case with the majority of people who work in offices (or in many other places for that matter). Far be it from me to claim some sort of special sympathy for this, there are far more important things to worry about. However, it has led me to spend most of the morning, most of this week so far in fact, pondering on what I could be doing instead.  Having trained as an archaeologist, working in an accounts department was not really something that I had in mind upon leaving university. Admittedly, I have no right to feel bitter about the fact I don't work in my chosen field. At one time I did possess the title of "professional archaeologist" - for the grand total of one week. Happy as I was to get the job at the time, the commuting from London to Leeds on a weekly basis didn't really fill me with all that much optimism. So I jacked.   I'm not really sure where this is going to be honest, much like my daily pondering on the subject of jobs it just seems to wander around aimlessly. I seem to spend more time working out what is so bad about the situation I am actually in, than trying to work out how to make it better.

      Went out to the pub last night to watch the Greece v Czech Republic game last night, with a load of Greek people. Amazing experience. Never fails to impress me that the majority of other football fans can celebrate without having to belittle the opposition and shout abuse, like the majority of England fans.   Being Welsh, I don't really have much chance to celebrate anything, so I'm not sure how I would react!   As an England fan pointed out to me, the English will never be able to feel like the Greeks do now. If they get to a final, they feel as if it is their God given right to be there, since they are the best. Greece on the other hand were just amazed to qualify for the semis - let alone get to the final.  Personally, due to the absence of Wales in the tournament and the infectious nature of the Greek celebrations last night, I'm supporting Greece for this one!  PAME HELLAS!  What finished off the night perfectly was that we went on after the game to meet my Greeks friends flat mate. Turns out he is Canadian, and yesterday was Canada Day. Seems like I was the only person in London without a justifiable reason to be celebrating! Didn't stop me though, did it...

      On a small alleyway I walk down on a fairly regular basis on my way to work, between Doric Way and Chalton Street in Somerstown, the is a strange looking little door. On this door is a sign which says "Mick's Eel Supply". The door doesn't seem to be much in use - in fact I have never seen it standing open, nor anyone pass through it.   I can't help finding it weird though. Why is the sign there?   Presumably at one time the building or room behind it contained Mick's eel supply, but I wouldn't even be able to say if this was a commercial operation or just some private stash. Having said that, if it were a private thing, Mick must be the biggest consumer of eels in London if he requires a special building to house them. On the other hand though, if it is a commercial thing, why tell us it is his eel supply, why not just the name of the company. In fact, why anything at all - since it isn't, or wasn't, a shop or anything.   Not really a particularly important thing I suppose, to know the reason for the sign. I'm just interested. I'll hopefully have a picture of it up soon, so you can appreciate it's oddness with me...  I mean, who even likes eels?

       First Ascent of Mont Blanc   August 8th 1786 marked the first ascent of Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, by Dr. Michael-Gabriel Paccard and Jacques Balmat, two residents of the local town of Chamonix. This event is widely regarded as the start of modern Alpinism. Dr. Paccard was driven by two main desires - that a resident of Chamonix should be the first to climb the peak and to calculate once and for all the actual height of the mountain and prove it to be the highest in Europe (Dr. Paccard believing it was actually higher than had previously been proposed).  Paccard and Balmat (a local crystal hunter) left Chamonix at 2pm on August 7th, with a light wind blowing from the west and the summit of the mountain in clouds. They continued upwards during the afternoon and evening, bivouacing around 9pm, at an altitude of 2300m. Continuing the climb at 4.15am the following morning, they were forced to continue for almost the entirety of the following day, Paccard not planting his red summit flag, visible from the village below, until 6.30pm on August 8th. Ironically Paccard's barometer had become damaged at some point during the climb and he was unable to make his all important altitude mesurement. However, at least he had the compensation that a Chamonard had made the climb - the first of the great European peaks to fall.

       The Kon-Tiki raft smashes into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands     Believing that the indigenous peoples of Polynesia originated in South America, the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl conceived an expedition to show that this was indeed a possibility. He constructed a raft, which he named "Kon-Tiki" after the Inca sun-god, solely from materials which would have been available at the time in question. This was launched from the coast of Peru, with the only modern apparatus on board being a radio. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft across the Pacific Ocean for 101 days and 4300 miles, living solely on food which they pulled from the ocean on their journey. They eventually smashed into the reef at Raroia on August 7th 1947.  Recently, however, the validity of the experiment has been brought into question. While there is little doubt that the Kon-Tiki journey proves that such actions may have been possible in the past, the archaeological record of Polynesia suggests that the pattern of settlement took place from west to east - meaning that the settlers are more likely to have come from southeast Asia than South America. However, while the scientific results of the expedition can be doubted, there can be no questioning its place in the history of great adventures .

       Abdication of Emperor Francis II (von Habsburg): End of the Holy Roman Empire   The Holy Roman Empire was an institution unique in world history. Never a nation state, despite a the Germanic origins of the majority of its rulers, it was in many senses more of a confederation on religious grounds. At the height of its powers it covered the modern countries of Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, as well as eastern France and northern Italy. Ruled over by the King of Germany, the ruler, however, was never considered the Emperor until his coronation by the Pope - thus establishing the religious pretext for his power. Showing the confusion over the actual status of the organisation, many contemporaries did not know what name to give them Emperor. Voltaire described it as, "neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire."  The actual date of the creation of the Empire is also open to question. Many would date it to Christmas Day 800, with the crowning of the Emperor Charlemagne in St. Peters Basilica, Rome. However, despite similarities in his position, Charlemagne styled himself as ruler of the Franks, so some would not accept this as a formation date. A more realistic date would be with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which began the break up of the Frankish lands into three sections and eventually led to the end of the Carolingian dynasty in the East. However, at the very latest it can be said to date to 962, with the crowning of the Emperor Otto I "the Great".  As the leader of this large, multi-ethnic empire, the Emperor Francis II (crowned 1792) was worried by, and greatly opposed to, the call for liberty and equality across Europe by Napoleon. He fought France in the French Revolutionary Wars. Defeated by them, he was forced to cede the left bank of the Rhine, though this was in exchange for Venice and Dalmatia. He turned against them again during the Second Coalition, eventually suffering a crushing defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz (December 2nd 1805). After this defeat he was forced to agree to the Treaty of Luneville, which led to the dissolving of the Holy Roman Empire and the end of almost a millennium of continuous rule.
