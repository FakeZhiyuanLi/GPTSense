      Uhmm..not much here. Just..thinking alot. I mean ALOT. Hmm..I really wanna try writing a novel again. The last fwe times didnt work so well because I kept getting stuck,a nd I couldnt getr anywhere else without sounding stupid. I like to write about vampires. Thats all I write about lol. Well, if anyone's got any ideas, tell me. *dances* Doo dee doo dee doo... Heard from David today....I havent talked to him for so long..i dont know wtf is going on, but he's been suicidal again (he gets like that, he has a mental problem, he shot himself when he was 13), well, was, rather, when I heard from him 4 months ago...I think he ran away. I dont know if he still is somewhere else now, I doubt it. Im really worried about him...  Anywhoo...I feel sick, so Im gonna go and erm..yea. Byes.

      Lol..animal jail. :( It was okay I guess *shrugs*. It was depressing in a way...at least Steph was there. Like..when we got to the tiger area, there was this glass, and this large male tiger was pacing back and forth, his muscles rippling with grace and strength. I saw his eyes, and in them I saw what I see in mine every day. Emptyness, anger, hurt. He was so beautiful...such a lovely creature should not be imprisioned. But, it keeps him safe from scumbag hunters and pochers and the like. I will almost definently get pictures up tommorrow..hehe...I hope to Bastet your eyes do not bleed. Im not that pretty, sorry. Or skinny...Im a freaking fat ass. I hate my father...harsh as it seems, I do. Okay...Steph was with right?? Well, she was wearing shorts and a tanktop, and steph is like...really pretty. I mean, skinny and stuff. well..my sick ass father kept looking at her like he does me sometimes.....my hair's been falling out all day. Stress...:( And i have another one of my lovely stress headaches. Anywhoo...Im gonna go...my head is pounding....toodles.

        Man...what a great way to start out a morning...go downstiars and see that our cable's been shutoff. Again. Because my parents never pay our bills, unless I happen to remind them, or the electric or summat gets shutoff. *sigh* Dad just went down...of course had a fit. I can't wait to leave...at least with Stephanie I'm not stressed out about every little thing, and I'm alot happier. Ever since we met in fourth grade, when I came as a new student, we haven't been away from each other for more than a week...but that was just because of our yearly vacation (which always sucks..). Otherwise, we go to the park about every 2 days lol. To do nonsense stuff like...hehe...nevermind.           I have six bucks or so, and I wanted to give mom all that, if she payed for the rest of this movie I want at Barnes and Nobles. Queen of the Damned. Wow that is the BEST movie ever! Anyone seen it?? I loove it. Sadly, we are too busy this weekend. Oh well, I can wait.           *thinks* This was a rather pointless entry, but w/e. I just got on to say that I'll write sometime later on tonight about how it went, and it ended up being all this. hehe. Well, comments people! :D Toodles!      ~*Blessed be*~

      Yeah lol. For once hehe. Went school shopping, got some nice stuff. Um...yea lol. *shrugs* what more to say on that?  Anyfrigginwhoozles...we're going to the Minnesota Zoo tommorrow. I did not know that...Dear Isis I am an airhead. I invited Stephanie (best friend lol) to come, so it will be pretty fun! She always makes everything fun. One of her talents hehe. I dunno..Im not sure I like zoos..i only like them because they keep animals safe from humans and such. But...it seems sort of mean to gawk at them like aliens or summat. I know how they feel...behind bars, looking on the outside, an outsider, being treated like a circus act. I know how it is. *sigh*  On Sunday, we're going to the movies. My brother is going to see some YuGiOh Movie (I HATE YU GI OH!!!!!!!!!!! *throws fetus at TV*), but IM gonna see The Villiage! :D Omfg it looks great. After that we're going shopping...I need new clothes. So...yea, Nikole is gonna be a busy person. Well, I hope everyone's day went well...I am gonna go. If anyone wants to caht on MSN, my name on it is;  urlLink Mydnyte_fantasy@excite.com . I know it sounds wrong shutup...mydnyte fantasy...it was the name of a showhorse I happen to be a fan of ookay? :P Lol..ta ta. Sleep tight all..dont let the fetuses bite.  *random thought* hmm...I want Irish Creme Coffee right now...really bad. Or a MooLatte from dairy queen...hmm. I have strange urges for coffee at the worst times lol. Ta ta.

      Lately, all I think about is suicide. It would be so easy, so quick...no pain nor fear left to torment. A simple slide of silver razors across the delicate skin of my fragile wrists...a knife across my throat, or an overdose of Coriciden ending it all. But I cannot die...not yet. I couldn't bear to leave knowing how many would be hurt by my loss...Bianca, Ainsley, Ali, Stephanie...:( And more. I know Ains wont wanna read this..he'll freak. But sometimes i need to feel better by writing shit down...  Anywhoo..hehe...I'm in love. With a sweet teddy bear...ainsley. aww....hehe. yea....comments peeps!
