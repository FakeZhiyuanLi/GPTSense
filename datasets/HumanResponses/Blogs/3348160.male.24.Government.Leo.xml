      I must say even though the Flyers fell to the Lighting in game 7 it was definately one of the best regular seasons, and playoffs I have seen in years.  I am not going to review the game because it is just to painful for me.  Lets just say that there was no quit until the end.   This team reminded me of the Sixers team a few years back that went to the finals against the Lakers.  They to were a special team with all the starters and bench being battered, and bruised, injured, basically half dead.  Even though they lost to the Lakers in the end, they never quit, complained, or gave up hope.  Unfortunately the team will probably be a quarter dismantled in the off season due to salary issues, but hey, there may even not be a next season with the possible lock-out coming after the playoffs.  I enjoyed this season, this playoffs, the coach, the players, and especially Keith Primeau.  I wish that the entire team could stay together for another year.  This season should be one of the most remembered season for a time to come.  So I bid my hockey season farewell!  GO FLAMES!!!

      Has anyone else ever watched  urlLink  Philadelphia Flyers  games on stations such as:   urlLink  ABC 6  or either of the  urlLink  ESPN  channels?  Well if you have then you will know exactly what I am about to talk about.  If you do not, then do not read this because you suck and are not worthy of reading, nor understanding this. :)  I used to enjoy watching hockey on ESPN with Barry Melrose, Steve Levy, Darren Pang, and Mike Emmerick, but during the entire regular season, and (especially) the playoffs, none of these "hockey guru's" have anything good to say about the way the flyers perform during games.  I am sick of listening to these assholes, and I'll use last night as an example, saying things like:  "The Lighting are so good at this, and that, and the goaltender made/makes amazing saves, he is a hall-of-famer....and so on".  This is not just this series, it was like this last serious, and the series before.  If any of these guys made comments about the flyers like they do about the opposing team, the world would come to an end. I may be biased in the way I think about the other teams, but I am certainly not deaf!    After I was done smashing my TV into a million pieces while thinking of Barry and the crew, I still cannot calm down about this.  Everyone knows how all of the  urlLink  NHL  has had it out for the Flyers ever since the "Broad Street Bullies" days.  This especially includes the referees and their lack of vision.   Next time you watch the Flyers, mark down how many good things they say about the flyers versus the other team.  You will be stunned!  Ok the "why they should not" list:  1) Do not know anything about the team, player, or organizations, yet are allowed to talk, and act like they do.  2) Can never talk about how good the flyers actually are.  3) Only point out what the flyers did wrong, even if they are winning!  .....there are more, I am getting flustered thinking about this!

      Wow!  Thats about all you can say about Thrusday nights Game 6 against the Tampa Bay Lighting in Philadelphia.  Once again Philly's Captain  urlLink  Keith Primeau  has proven to be the  urlLink NHL's  best leader.  I do not know how I made it through the entire game without having a heart attack.  Within minutes Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavlier stunned the hometown crown with a disgusting, I mean sick, slap shot right past  urlLink  Robert Esche .  It came off a bad turnover by Dennia Seidenburg, but it was only his second game back, and you stick him in one of the best series in NHL history, mistakes happen.    A few minutes later, one the best players in the NHL,  urlLink  Keith Primeau  , surged up center ice, taking two men with him,   urlLink  Primeau  kicked the puck to a wide open  urlLink  Simon Gagne  who tapped it out of mid air to tie the game.   urlLink  Gagne  who has not had the best of offensive numbers this year, showed us all how much patience, skill, and nerves of steel he has.  Once again Primes continued to be the reason why the Flyers got on the board.  .....Jumping ahead.....  Ok so Ex-Flyer Rusty Fedotenko smoked Esche up high twice.  Lecavlier fired a second monster slapper that Esche got a piece of, but not enough.   Sami Kappanen, one of the best two-way players in the NHL, took a slapper from Khabibulin's right side that stuck to the ice like glue and slipped in the bread basket of the ever twitching goaltender (anyone ever notice that?)  Next, el-capiton, made an almost impossible play to bury his second goal of the evening.  A shot from the point that Khabibulin made a right pad save on, drifted towards Primes who (with his right skate) kicked it through the crease, to himself to bury it home with a 1:49 seconds to go in the 3rd, to tie it at 4, and keep the Flyboys alive in their hunt for a game 7.  As Primes said in a post game interview "If I had to score two goals to tie, I was going to do it."  .....Overtime.....  So the start of OT comes, and the Flyers owned it!  From the start that Flyers played hard-nosed, hit everything it site, let no puck touch a Tampa player, unload on Khabibulin from everywhere,  no-holds-bar hockey.  Well, it paid off!  Once again the "new" Primeau line (Primes, Gags, and JR) solved Tampa's defense, and the "Boulin Wall".  Nice work along the wall, passing, led to a wide open net for Gagne's second goal of the night, which for the second time in the game, came from a Primeau pass.  WE SURVIVE!  An exciting game, if you missed it, SHAME ON YOU!  If we play like we did in the 3rd, and OT period in game 7, there will be no possible way Tampa can beat us.  We also need to improve on those small little things that Tampa feeds of off (and makes you pay for them) called turnovers.  Esche did not exactly have his best game last night, but neither goalie has really had a good series.    There is no quit in this team.  They will not let the opportunity that is there for them to take pass by.  This may be the only chance for a few of the players to win, let alone go to the Stanley Cup Finals, and the one person who will not them forget that, or let it pass them by is their fearless leader.  Saturday night, Game 7, this is the year of the Flyer.

      Before tonight the series between the  urlLink  San Jose Sharks  and the   urlLink  Calgary Flames  was tied 2-2, with neither team winning a home game yet!  On the half flip side you have the  urlLink  Philadelphia Flyers  and the  urlLink  Tampa Bay Lighting  who each split games at home ....Whats that you say? Home Ice advantage who?    To be continued............sorry to tired

           After having an unbelieveable road trip, a losing streak had shown is ugly head to the Phillies.        I cannot speak to much for the first loss (since I only saw a small portion) to the Rockies besides the fact that Byrd and Rollins did not have the best of days at the plate.  Ledee and Utley both had three run homeruns.      Trying to continue his four game win streak, since getting off to a shakey 0-2 start, was Kevin Millwood.  Millwood was pretty much roughed up right from the start.     Was it not sweet to be in first place for a day?!?        Today's loss to the Rockies was a little more ugly than yesterdays.  After being up 6-0 by the end of the third inning, the Phils saw nothing but goose eggs from there on.      Randy Wolf had another strong outting as he went 6.1 innings, giving up 7 hits, but only 2 earned runs, with 8k's.      Cormier was lit up for 3 runs on 4 hits on 13 pitches! Thats right 13 pitches!  He did not make it through the inning before being replaced.      Hitting wise the Phils continued to hit well during the road trip, at least the 3 through 8 spot which combined for 12 hits.  Pat the Bat went 2-5 with 2 singles to continue hitting in the .300's.  Chase Utley who was having a horrible road trip until yesterdays 3-run-homerun day, went 2-4 with 3 RBI's.  Rollins & Byrd batted goose eggs today.      So we come to the bottom of the ninth.  With one man one Vinny Castilla walks up to the plate, and walks away with a 2-run walk off homerun to give the Phils their second straight loss.      This one hurt a little more then yesterdays, but look at the bright side......we are only 1.5 games out of first.

      Ok, so I missed the Flyers, and Phillies game today.  However, I watched plenty of ESPN, and Comcast Sports Net to be in the know.  I even listen to the 129th Preakness Stakes on my way home from the airport!  And to be honest with you, it was actually quite exciting to listen to.  But lets get back to the Broad Street Bullies (Flyers link located on the bottom left of this site).  As we all know ABC hosted today's game.  To my disappointment of course, because they do not replay the game.  I only have one question.  Could Keith Primeau become, or already be one of the greatest captains in hockey history?  If the faithful have been watching all this year's playoff games we saw him pulverize most of the New Jersey Devil players until they did not even show up to play anymore.  Then Toronto, after a fairly slow start for himself, Hitchcock challenged Primeau to step it up in game 5, in a closed door meeting between himself and Prims.  The result, a man with all systems set on "kill" and to top it off he pulls a hat trick out from his sleeve.  Motivating the rest of the team to score on almost every shot they took.  The rest of the series was history!  We now come to Tampa Bay.  The first game, everyone was flat.  The slaughter that took place in game 2 looked like the game 5 against Toronto, with the Captain flying around like a crackhead on speed.  Game 3, very disappointing, only one person showed up to play that game, and that was Primeau.  For being a guy who missed a handful of games this year, suffered a concussion right before playoffs start, he flew around the ice, hit everything in site, and gave the flyers hope (26 seconds of it)of a comeback win in game 3 that was immediately squashed due to the shotty play of the entire rest of the team.  Primeau has bought into the systems that Hitchcock sells, as well as the rest of the team, and even Roenick is coming around to Hitch.  The team has bought into Primeau as their leader.  So he does not have the greatest offesive numbers, but that doesn't make you a leader cause you can score.  It's showing up to play everyday, leading by example, and being a veteran leader that even the veterans look up to.    Ah the Phillies.  Has this recent road trip been a preview of what everyone, prior to the preseason, was expecting.  Again, I missed today's 16-5 slaughter of the Rockies, but I have not missed any other games on this West Coast swing.  Rollins is beginning to hit, and hit well at that!  Pitching is beginning to look like a staff that could possibly defeat a team of the Yankees, Red Sox, Braves type calibour.  Abreu is coming around.  Burrell continues to look like the Burrell of two years ago.  Besides a few injuries that continue to plague some of the starters (Wagner & Thome), and a lot of recent errors, this team is starting to get me excited.  To get excellent reviews of the Phillies games check out  urlLink Phillies Blog .  Mike does excellent, in-depth reviews of games, stats, players!  Now the 129th Preakness Stakes.  I was able to listen to the race on 1060am on my way home yesterday afternoon.  All this week I wondered why people were making such a big deal about horse racing, and Philly own Smarty Jones.  I am the type that does not like to see animals used for money, but let me tell you it was quite exciting listen to the race.  And it was also a record setting race (11.5 horses ahead) the longest space between 1st and 2nd place in Preakness history.  So maybe I will watch the Belmont Stakes in June.......after all we may just have two parades coming down Broad Street in June ;)  Can Philly get anymore Euphoric?

      Ok, so I decided to dabble (spelling anyone?) in HTML, and website creation, so I went with the blogspot first.  Actually the are two reason behind my maddness for creating this space.  First, that exactly what I wanted.  My own little "space" (hence The warehouse) on the internet.  Second, my love is going to Italy for two weeks this afternoon.  Its not the first time that she is going to be in a foreign country while being with me, and I will be talking to her, but am what you call a "worry-body", and how can I give a full days review of my life in a few minutes (see Daily Log link at the bottom of this page).  So yeah there are more reasons.  I would like my little space to become a place where people actually stop in here everyday to check out the daily topic of conversation, sports, news, music and comment on it.  Whoa I'm tired! I'm off in a half hour.  Almost time to go the airport.  I am deathly afraid of planes....this will be the longest 13 hours of my life.  Honey, I will miss you dearly!

      Due to a mass brain fart on my part my previous "Warehouse" fell into the abyss.  Check out all the new features on the right hand side of the page.    One of the best features is the "Forum" where anyone can post topics that can be seen and replied to by anyone who pleases, so please contribute.    The "calendar" shows my daily schedule, b-days, events, and anything else that someone wants me to add. So let me know what your b-day is, or anything else of importance that is going on so I can post it.  The new "photo album" that bravenet offers is a great way to post/view photos.  I can even allow users to post photos in the album, so email me if you would like access.(sszerlagjr@verizon.net)  A new version of an online poll is also new here.  If you have any poll questions you would like to see posted, again, please email me.  So enjoy the new blog, contribute, and pass it around to your friends.  Thanks.

      As you all know today is the 60th anivarsary of  urlLink  D-Day, the allied invasion at Normandy, France  which was the beginning of the liberation of France from the Nazi's, as well as the rest of Europe.  Thousands of american and allied soldiers gave their lives on this day, on what was the largest land/sea/air invasion in history.

      To much of the dismay of police departments across the United States another  urlLink  police officer from PA was killed  in the line of duty, in the early hours of saturday morning.  Officer Michael Wise, of the Reading Police Department, was shot in the head while sitting in an unmarked patrol vehicle, with two other officers watching a possible suspect from a murder earlier that evening.  Pennsylvania is currently #1 on list for  urlLink  officers killed in the line of duty  in 2004, and in the top ten for officers killed throughout history.

      Everyone should be thankful for the ultimate sacrifice that the men and women of the military gave, and continue to give, for all of our freedom.  So I will leave everyone with a quote that they should really think about whenever they say fighting war is wrong or unnecessary.    "War is an ugly thing, but NOT the ugliest of things.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is MUCH worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important then his own personal safety, is a miserable creature, and has NO chance of being free, unless MADE or KEPT so by the exertions of BETTER men then himself" -John Stuart Hill  Don't forget why you are all still alive, in our free country.

      Ok, so I am sure that everyone has gotten a pop-up for the "get 10,000 smilies for free."&nbsp; Well, last night as I was playing around on the interent I decided to check it out, and let me tell you it is a   MUST   download.&nbsp; The only down-fall to it, and it wasn't a down-fall to me, was that when you download the service it adds an extra toolbar to your browser.&nbsp; Actually, the toolbar that you get with the program makes it 10 times easier to use the program.&nbsp; The program not only comes with   10,000+ smilies  , but it also allows you to  add backgrounds to your email , add a  personalized signature with picture  (yours or theirs) with up to 4 lines of text.&nbsp; You can also add a custom stamp to your email that you can add text to also.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is  10,000+ screensavers ,  and wallpaper  for your desktop to choose from.&nbsp;  I ended up playing with the program for about 3 hours last night and could not even go through all of the great options.&nbsp;    This is a must download and I highly recommend it!     Oh, another down-fall that I failed to mention is that it only works with certain email programs (for the backgrounds and signatures).&nbsp; However, the company updates the email programs monthly so if yours is not on there now, it may very well be soon!   If you are interested  in this service I made a   link to it on the right hand of my blog  , about halfway down.&nbsp;     THIS IS A MUST DOWNLOAD!!!

      Former Eagles middle line backer, once feared by those who faced him, two time pro-bowler, and team leader  urlLink Jeremiah Trotter  has returned to the Eagles for, at least, one year pending a physical sometime this month.&nbsp;  urlLink Philadelphia Eagles  coach Andy Reid noted that He and Trotter had put behind the heated arguement that occured during a contract dispute two years ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I for one am looking foward to seeing Trotter back on the team.&nbsp; However, I hope this does not cause any internal problems since  urlLink Mark Simoneau &nbsp;is the current starting middle line backer.&nbsp; Hopefully, the leadership that Trotter once brought to Philadelphia every Sunday has not disappeared.

      I added a "On this day in History...." fun link to the blog.  You can read the daily "what happened" on the day.  You can also see birthdays.  Here is what happened in history on my birthday, August 5th:  1305: Scottish hero Sir William Wallace, who led the Scottish resistance to an English invasion in 1298, is captured near Glasgow by the English. He will later be executed for treason.   1583: English explorer Sir Humphrey Gilbert founds the first English colony in North America, near Saint John's, Newfoundland. The colonists soon return to England, however.   1912: The Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party, chooses former president Theodore Roosevelt, who led the group's break from the Republican Party, as their presidential candidate.   1962: Movie star Marilyn Monroe is found dead of a barbiturate overdose at her home in Los Angeles, California.   1963: The United States, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United Kingdom sign a nuclear test ban treaty. Ninety-six other nations sign the pact, but France declines.  Here are some people I share a birthday with:  Mary Beard, historian and feminist (1876)  Naum Gabo, sculptor (1890)  John Huston, film director and actor (1906)  Neil Armstrong, astronaut (1930)  Wassily Leontief, economist (1906)  Patrick Ewing, basketball player (1962)  Enjoy!

      Obviously you can tell it's been a while since I posted anything at all.  So here is a brief update.  I have been working two jobs, taking two classes, and interviewing for police departments.    I still post things in the forum from time to time so check in there for new stuff.  However, only one person has replied to them so I may dump the idea, even though you can post your own topics in my forum, only one person has done so thus far.  I will have some things up soon, and my other website will be up soon, which will have a lot more things since you cannot add to to much to the blogs.  As soon as things settle down I shall return.

      Ah things have just been settling down for me over the past week or so. I am still working two jobs; one at the Hatboro Police Department, the second at Temple University. Recently, actually it was this past Wednesday, I found out that I was to be hired this upcoming Monday at Bristol Borough Police Deparment as a police officer. Obviously, I was quite excited when I found this out because I have been trying to get a police officer job for about a year now. If anyone does not know what it is like to get a cop job it is a very long and selective process with many interviews and test (polygraphs, physicals, etc.). Ok, so before I go on the Chief of the department told me himself over the telephone that I was to be hired, and sworn in on Monday.    Now here is the part where it feels like to be shit on  .  Last night the Detective for Bristol Borough Police Department calls me on the telephone and requests my presence at the station at 11AM this morning. I was thinking "great, time to sign some paperwork, and go over everything before Monday) but  NO!  this was not the case at all.  Conversation:  Det:   Stephen close the door   . (A nasty tone)   Det:   Sit down  .  Me:  Ok .  Det:   We have a problem  .  Me:  What's that .  Det:   You lied on your original application  .  Me:  Pardon me .  Det:   You stated that you have never served in the military before, however, when you took the polygraph test, you claimed to have been discharged from the United States Navy on the premis of having asthma.    Me:  Thats correct. I was discharged from bootcamp after having two asthma attacks .  Det:   Why did you answer "no" to this question that asks if you have ever been discharged from the military for medical reasons.    Me:  Well, correct me if I am wrong sir, that question appears in a section where it states "do you claim veterans preference points", in turn I answered no to this questions due to the lack of active duty time.   Det:   Ok, well you are wrong. This question appears before the veterans preference points question.    Me:  May I see my application? (Det hands me the application) Oh, ok, I appeared to have misunderstood the question.   Det:   How could you possibly misunderstand the question!?!? It clearly states what it is asking for. You lied, and if you lie we eliminate you from the hiring process.     (Keep in mind I was told on Wednesday night that I was to be sworn in on Monday night, and I had taken a polygraph test over 3 weeks ago, which I  passed  with flying colors ).  Me:  Oh, sorry, just made an honest mistake. I thought the question came under the section under the veterans points category thats why I did not answer the questions/put "no" for various military questions.   Det:   Well we see this as you are lying. And if you are going to lie about one thing, this is usually a precurser to lying on police reports, and to other officers.      Me:    What!   I have written over a thousand police reports at my present job, and have never, and would never falsify a police report. I have disclosed everything in my past, and present on the polygraph test which, you told me yourself that I was truthful. One of the questions was "Did I lie on my original application for employment" which I answered "no" and the test showed I was not being decietful.   Det:   Well, we are are sorry Stephen, but the Chief and I have already discussed this and we decided not to pursue you anymore for an employee. However, you may reapply after six months.    Me:  Sir, excuse me for being blunt but why the hell would I lie about being discharged from the military for asthma? I disclosed information to you about my past drug use, and all of the crimes I have committed in the past. I have nothing to hide from you now, nor have I lied to you or anyone else during this entire process. I made an honest mistake. I have included my military record on over 10 other job applications. I disclosed it when I went to the academy. For what reason do you think I would hide this from   this   department?   Det:   I am sorry, our policy is that if you lie once during this whole process you are done. You are done. I am however going to have one more meeting with the chief before we make our final decision, but I do not think the outcome will be in your favor. Thank you for coming in, and good luck with the rest of your career.    Me:  Ok. Thank you .  This meeting ruined my day, week, months. This was very unfair.  I will post the final result.   This is what it feels like to be shit on .
