         I continue to be amazed at the amount of people who have jobs but don't really do anything at them.  They drive around, or just hang out, and they get paid to do it.  People wonder why the economy is so bad, well a big part of it must be businesses that pay people a lot of money to do nothing, or send e-mails, or blog, or talk on the phone.  I don't know, maybe they do do something, I just notice when they're not.  Who knows.     I didn't post yesterday, because I really had nothing to say.  LeCroy hits a pinch-hit grand slam to win for the Twins in the ninth, and KG goes Jordan on it and takes game seven for the Wolves.  Problem is, today the Twins got housed by the White Sox, and tomorrow the T-Wolves have to play the Lakers.  At this point I'm just waiting for Kobe to fly a helicopter directly on top of the Target Center, careen down a rope onto mid-court, catch a pass, and dunk from the 3 point line.  It will all be a moot point though, if he's convicted.     I'm golfing tomorrow before work, I'll let you know how I do, not during work though, because that would be wrong.

         Just saw the tail end of Randy Johnson's perfect game on my extra innings package and it made me chuckle a bit, just because I was talking about throwing one on a video game in the post before this one (Sims, Games and Me) and how it wasn't that realistic.     What does it feel like to attain perfection?  I don't think I have ever come close to doing anything perfect in my life, save for a few tests in school or something small like that.  No blown call walks, no cheap little dink hits, no errors from your fielders, 80 out of 107 pitches for strikes when the top of the ninth started, just perfect.     That was the 17th perfect game ever in Major League Baseball.  The league's modern era has been around since 1892 or so, and each team plays a 162 game schedule.  I'd say that's pretty rare.       Well, that's it for today, if you'll excuse me I'm going to see how many games it takes for me to throw a perfect game against the Braves in Diamond Mind Baseball... the simulation.

      I just got done with one of the better  urlLink Tiger Woods Golf  runs I've ever been on, birdieing 5 of the last 6 holes, and eagleing the other... domination.  I was doing some reading on the game on the net and came across these two quotes:  1."This is truly a wonderful golf simulation game, and one that deserves praise for its attention to detail and the staggering amount of features." --GameZone.com  2."I have every reason to believe that Tiger Woods 2004 is going to be the best golfing game ever."  --IGN.com (PC version)  What's the difference between these two statements?  Well, one of them is ludicrous, the other is spot on (for me, at least).    I play a lot of sports games on consoles and computers alike, and I've always said there is a difference between genres of sports video games. On one hand are the simulations... the games that  simulate  the sport they represent.  urlLink Diamond Mind Baseball ,  urlLink Front Office Football  and  maybe   urlLink Championship Manager  fit into that.  I say maybe for CM because it seems that if you run with a good squad, results come fairly easier than expected.  The biggest reason that these are sims and not games is because the player does not control the action, only the strategy behind it.  In other words, I can tell Moe Williams to run a sweep, but ultimately have no control over him when he does.  I can tell Terry Mulholland to pitch 6 shutout innings of relief, but he in all likelihood will give up 3 or 4 runs.  I hit a 487 foot home-run with Mark Loretta in  urlLink MVP Baseball .  Now he can hit a few homers here and there, but 487 feet?  Here's a quote  urlLink  from an article on long distance homeruns by William J. Jenkinson written in 1996.     "Fewer than one in a million men are capable of powering a ball 450 feet against major league caliber pitching."  I do it regularly (at least twice a game, with all sorts of players) in MVP.    Do I think MVP is a bad game because I can do this?  No.  In fact, I think it's very enjoyable sometimes to hit 487 foot homeruns and throw perfect games (w/Barry Zito).  There are times for both sets of games, just like how people listen to different types of music to suit their mood, or are simultaneously enthralled with "the O.C" and hate all reality-television.   Which brings me back to Tiger Woods Golf.  Obviously, unless I average about a 65 score per 18 holes, Tiger Woods is a game, not a sim.  I shot a 96 last weekend and felt pretty decent about it, so it's nice to be able to do whatever you want to with a golf ball once in a while.   I'm sure I'll get into all of this more as these types of games pretty much rule my life.  That may sound pathetic, it may not.  For the people who don't think so, I encourage you to keep reading, for the people that do, I encourage you to as well, because it might be interesting to figure out why we like our games so much.

          Out of town for the weekend to the old stomping grounds, Eau Claire, WI, home of the drunken being.  See you Sunday.

        Well let's just post this and we'll go from here.  Is this the start of a glorious and fruitful relationship with all things and people computer/internet related?  Or just another failed attempt to start something worthwhile?  Is a blog even considered worthwhile?  Either way.    The Twins swept the Mariners today, led by 8 innings of shutout ball by Brad Radke yesterday and 9 innings by Santana, Mulholland, Romero and Nathan today.  I keep saying how their pitching doesn't look any good, and they'll implode any day now, but they seem to be gaining strength... with especially good showings against the mashers from Anaheim and the Mariners.  We'll throw out that Oakland series.  24 walks.  Ugh.    I'm not going to write a ton tonight, because this is the first post and I really have no idea where I want to go with this yet, so I'll try to ease into it.
