      Well here we go.  Time to start a new part of my eternal quest for tech.  I will really be happy if I can sit in my local coffee shop (The Bean Scene) and edit this page on my handheld (HP Pocket PC) on the wireless system in place.  Then and only then will i be satisfied.  By the way HI scott

      Number Three Everyone leads!   Number three at some point in time… Everyone leads!   At a distance, the flock of geese that we have been talking about appears to be guided by a single leader. The lead bird does, in fact, guide the formation, winging smoothly through the incoming elements. If the lead goose tires, however, it rotates back into formation and another bird flies at the point of position.   Teenagers need to learn how to serve as well as lead. And leading is not just flying but learning to fly along with others. You could say it this way: Following is not just serving but the enjoyment of serving.   Honk and Encourage: Each flock finds its own rhythm. The pulsating sound of the great wings beating together excites and energizes the whole Formation. The geese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.   (I've often wondered about that. It can really be annoying if you're trying to sleep and those loud honking geese fly over your house.)   "As I admonish you to admonish others, because of the grace given to all of us." -Romans 15:14-15 "Encourage one another in love and spirit. Making allowances in their imperfections yet all the while keeping the harmony." -Ephesians 4:2-7

      Number two: "Accept help and give help."   Remember last week I mentioned the geese flying in the "V" formation? When one of those big birds falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to fly alone and quickly rejoins the formation to take advantage of the uplifting power of the bird immediately in front. If you are a NASCAR fan you would call it "drafting".   Galatians 6:4 Let every man do with his own hand his best without comparison so he can say that I've done my all to the best of my ability and have the satisfaction of doing something worthwhile.   When you try to do things on your own, it will DRAG you down. Use the protection and the strength of the "team" to help give you the ingredients to keep flying.   Lift others in the team up by always being there in formation.

      Number One, Fly in Formation  Have you ever seen geese in formation? Ever look at how they soar through the sky with what seems uniformed direction? Well, it is! Uniformed, that is. I'm reminded of the question, "When geese are flying in the "V" formation why does one side always seem longer than the other?"   Answer: Because there are more geese on that side! (Smile it's contagious)   Does God have a purpose behind the way geese fly in that formation? It's called teamwork. As a team, Geese have learned to repeat their flying formation time and time again without evolving to another system. Why? Because it works! As a Youth Ministry worker, there is a Team Formation and Ministry Protocol that each of us must follow. And I'm not only talking about just following it but from time to time you may be the leader!   Number One, Fly in Formation:   Geese travel thousands of miles with ease and precision flying in a "V "formation. As each bird moves its wings it creates uplift for the bird following. Our engineers on staff have proven that "Formation Flying" is 70 percent more efficient than flying alone! Okay, we really don't have engineers on staff studying geese and "Formation Flying" but none the less it is proven to be more efficient. Just look at the Word of God.   Amos 3:3 - How can two walk together unless they agree? Deuteronomy 32:30 - One puts a thousand... two puts ten thousand... Stay in formation. You'll be 70% more efficient. Learn and submit and glide with others as you go together in the same "Press" direction.

      Are you getting enough helpers?  How about adult helpers?  Also, I wanted to note that I've planned a drama practice on Saturday, June 19th from 11-1.  I am not sure when your event starts, so does this conflict with Tatar Daze on the 19th?  If it does, can my students be late to Tatar Daze, or should I plan on them not being at practice?  I know that a few of my students signed up and I want them to partcipate in it if possible.  Be blessed!

      Number Four Good Times and Bad Times   5 natural spirits of Team Work. "Fly in Formation", "Accept help and give help," and "Everyone leads!"  What's up next? Glad you asked! Because sometimes there are Good Times and Bad Times.  When a goose gets sick, wounded or shot down, two geese drop out of Formation and follow it down to help and protect it.&nbsp; They stay with it until it is able to fly again or it dies.&nbsp; Then they launch out on their own to find another formation, or they catch up with their flock.  When you see someone from your team that is wounded or going down, 2 or 3 of you need to grab on to them and tend to their wounds until they're healed.  Matthew 18: Where ever 2 or 3 agree on any one thing believing it shall be done. Philippians 2:4-5 Don't just be concerned with your own interest but also each others.
