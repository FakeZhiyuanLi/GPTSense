        Dag nab it. Look what I found               Kindergarten classes are provided for all children of kindergarten age in the Rochester School District. Michigan Statutes stipulate that before a child can enroll in kindergarten, he or she must be five (5) years old on or before December 1.       Each spring the district conducts a Kindergarten Registration to identify and enroll youngsters who will enter kindergarten in the fall. Informational evening meetings are held in the spring for parents. Newspapers will announce the dates.       It greatly assists the districtâ€™s planning efforts if all kindergarten students are identified in early spring. Parents should contact the Student Enrollment Office or plan to attend Kindergarten Registration if they have a child who meets the age requirements.   Pupils are assigned to either morning or afternoon sessions based upon geographical location. Sessions are three hours and five minutes. Daily attendance is stressed because kindergarten is an integral part of the total instructional program."       *grmbl* Leslie could have started last year if she were in Michigan. She was ready. We fought them in Kansas to let her to no avail. AND she's been in half a day preschool for 2 and a half years. I want to go back to work and only having half a day school for her complicates things substantially.

      We needed someplace to put all this info we are collecting that Jason can get to from work, I can get to from home..even Debi and Mitz can post stuff if they so desire. :)    Voila. A Moving Blog....    SO.  Here's what we have so far:  We want to move back to Rochester ASAP. Jason has his Michigan nursing lisense (Hooray) and is in the process of contacting hospitals to set up interviews there on Aug 2-4 (Mon - Wed).   We are leaving here around 5 pm on Friday, July 30 and will drive like crazy people with a goal of arriving at Debi's late Saturday night.    I understand that VBS is Aug 1-5 so Debi's gonna get the kids signed up for that.

       Job : Well, yes.  As it stands right now, Jason has offers from North Oakland and St. Joseph Mercy (both in Pontiac) .   I also spoke with Julie from Beaumont yestarday and I really think they are going to offer him one too - their process is slower and they keep finding things in his file they need (she called yestarday to get a copy of his army paperwork).   House : Also Janet called about the log cabin - that looks pretty good too, depending on when we can move.  She didn't seem unsettled about our October target.   Money : So now it's really just a matter of finding the best way to get the most money in the shortest amount of time. Hehe.  Jason is spending his lunch hour today talking to travel nurse recruiters.  We thing that if he could get a quick 3 month assignment that paid big money (and they all do) that we'll just pack up the house - put everything in storage - and go to CA or Boston or Seattle or DC or wherever.  I'll homeschool for the 3 months and we'd live in a furnished  2 bdrm appt provided by the travel company.  I know it sounds crazy, but it'd be like a 3 month vacation.  It'd be terrific for the kids and lots of fun for us AND Jason can make huge money doing that.  Then by October, we'd have ample money to pay off everything here and start the way we want to start in Michigan.  It also has the added benefit of getting us away from here as quickly as possible.  So, that's the scoop! :)  Debi, I left Collin's shorts in your freezer *sigh* Can you mail them to me? I really need them.  He only has a couple of decent pairs of shorts....
