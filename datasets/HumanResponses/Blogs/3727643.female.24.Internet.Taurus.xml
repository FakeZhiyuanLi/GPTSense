      I set out to find the official meaning "hump day" and why it is called so.  I found that no one really knows who called it this first or why but assume that the person was either a really big perv or hated their life so much that they decided that Wens. was the middle of the week and if they had made it that far, Thurs. and Fri. would be ok too.  I don't really know BUT, "hump day" for me is EVERYDAY!  To me, "hump day" is any day that I put the kids in the car.  This means that I will have to "hump" to get them ready on time, I will have to double "hump" to make sure my shoes match, "humping" the diaper bag, apnea monitor, Nicholas in his car seat (23lbs all together) and Isaac by 1 arm to the car.  Then I make a "hump" sound as I lift each into my Kia Sportage 4x4.  Finally I make more "hump" noises as I buckle each child in.  FINALLY!  It is my professional opinion, as a mom, that "hump day" was created by a mother who experienced a similar experience on a daily basis.  Perhaps the reason that it is tagged onto a specific day is because back when people did things for the first time (1800's), there wasn't the convience of auto anything and "going to town day" was on Wens.  Makes sense to me.  Now that you see my way of logic, are you scared?  if so, for who are you scared? *laugh*

      I've had one of those busy days where nothing is accomplished.  It started atypically.  My husband went to work 12 hours earlier.  This meant that the kids had to be woke up early.  Kids are not happy when they are woke up early to be rushed out the door to take their favorite person to work.  Nicholas was like, "um, where's my titty?"  and Isaac was generally pissed -- he didn't get his coffee.  In the rush of the morning, Daddy forgot half of the things that he needed for the week, including his pillow -- poor baby.  Isaac got in a better mood when he got to play in Daddy's "beg fruck."  Somehow the kids always make my day completely better, this happened several times today.  The first "better" was after we left Daddy at work.  Nicholas was very unhappy at this unscheduled morning trip and was literally screaming.  Isaac bent over his car seat and under the canopy of Nicholas' and said, "its otay bankie, daddy at work nda beg fruck n momma gonna go to grammas and her'll give me a cukie."  I don't know if it was Isaac talking to Nicholas or the fact that Nicholas was wondering .oO well, don't I get a cookie? Oo.  Needless to say, it worked and Nicholas happily chewed on his strap covers on the way to Grandma's.  The next "better" was at Grandma's.  Austin and Isaac were fussing over something, I can't remember now, but Isaac was very upset.  He wanted me to kiss it and make it better but I had my arms full of Nicholas administering a very needed dose of titty.  Breastfeeding relaxes me to the point that I could go to sleep, so to Isaac, I was probably looking like I was ignoring him.  Isaac then tells his brother, "bankie, *jibber* *jabber* *more jibber and jabber*."  Nicholas then stops sucking, Isaac leans down and Nicholas gnaws Isaac's nose.  Isaac was better, Nicholas was confused and I almost wet myself laughing.  The final "better" takes a little more explaining but I'll try my best to keep it short for your reading pleasure.  Nicholas loves his bath.  He would stay in water if I'd let him but obviously I can't do that.  Every night I put him in his baby bathtub in the kitchen sink.  We splash, coo and have a great time making faces at each other while I wash him.  The whole experience is relaxing with the exception of the removal of Nicholas from the tub and until he is wrapped in his blanket, getting titty and going to sleep.  So, I take him out of the tub and he starts crying.  I lay him on his belly to rub lotion on his back and bum and he is crying.  Flip him over and rub the rest of his body in lotion, he is crying.  Dress him, he's crying, brush his hair, he's still crying, clean his ears, yep, you guessed it -- still crying and brush his gums, he get quiet for this.  Let me remind you that I do this every night and Isaac is usually already in the bed and asleep throughout the experience.  Tonight, for some reason, Isaac gets out of the bed, comes into the kitchen and talks to Nicholas as I'm rubbing him down.  Isaac starts patting Nicholas' head, as if he were a puppy, saying, "its otay bankie."  This instantly soothes Nicholas.  He is quiet.  I must say that it is much easier to dress an infant if they are not upset.  When I had Nicholas completed and as I looked down at Isaac to tell him thank you but to get back in the bed, Isaac looks at me and says, "der ya go april, bankie all better and I go night night but I need tea."  I couldn't help but laugh again.  Isaac held his empty sippy cup the entire time he soothed Nicholas.  I laid Nicholas in his crib long enough to fix Isaac a fresh sippy cup of milk, usually Nicholas could be heard for 4 counties screaming but not tonight.  He gave Isaac and I the same patience that Isaac just showed him.  I was able to get Isaac's milk, put Isaac in the bed, tuck him in, give him kisses 3 times and return to my bedroom to get Nicholas and he was quiet the whole time, laying there completely content.  This is just one more example at how great kids, life and the combination of both can be.

      I've has the opportunity to witness a young lady recently.  This chick is younger than I am in many ways.  When I was her age we had a few things in common:  new relationship with an older man, "married" life, being confused about everything, not knowing anything and not really making any plans for the future.  I really want to help this chick out, by taking her under my wing and teaching her things before she has a life altering occurance happen and HAS to learn them.  It all made me think about how I became the person I am and why I decided to take the paths that I did.  *plays "Memory"*  Living 101:  #1 - DO NOT have children before you have fed, sheltered and clothed yourself for atleast 5 years completely on your own.  Sure, family will help if they have to but trust me, they don't want to.  #2 - DO NOT assume things.  Always ask questions.  It is better to bug the hell outta whoever is teaching you than to assume and really fuck up.  #3 - DO NOT finance used cars from anyone other than a dealer with a large company name in it.  Ex: Ford, Chevy, Buick, Dodge....  You have to have full coverage insurance and the greatest number of used cars NOT on larger company dealer lots are pieces of shit and will cost you more than you want to pay.  #4 - ALWAYS write out contracts.  Verbal contracts are useless.  This rule even goes for family members.  Family is blood and it is thicker than water -- until it comes to money.  Business is business and if you don't cover your ass, no one will.  #5 - DO NOT loan anything that you can't replace.  This includes money.  #6 - Accept that NO one, even you, is perfect.  This will make dealing with people that have to be in your life easier to deal with.  #7 - Be fair at all cost.  Situations will vary but always be fair to yourself or others involved.  This rule may hurt the worst now but will pay off in the long haul of life.  #8 - ALWAYS respect elders.  I know they look funny, smell wicked, forget to put their teeth in and tell the same stories over but they will tell you more rules to help your quest in life.  There are more rules to life but following the advice of these eight will certainly keep your pocket fuller, your mind at ease, your sanity in tact and outbursts of bullshit to a minimum.  ~~living and loving it

      Around this time every year, until November, I get very sentimental and thankful.  Nicholas receiving his shots and living the night afterwards brought this years period on early.    I thank my lucky stars that I have beautiful children who are smart, well behaved and I have the patience to be a good mother.  That I have a husband that loves me for who I was, am and will be, who works hard to support his family that he loves dearly and isn't afraid to show it.  That I live in the mountains of North Carolina, where it is quiet, clean and everyone knows everyone.  That I have a living mother and father and that my eldest brothers and sisters live no where close *laugh* That I have a washing machine and dryer at home.  That my car is paid for and in great running order.  That our bills are paid, there is plenty of food in the cabinets and we still have $20 to spare. Thankful for second chances and the people that give them.  Lord knows I used that last one to the brim.  There are more...  ~~all gooey and stuff

      My house... If you have never changed a child's diaper when his ass exploded and you looked at the child and pondered where to start, then you will not be able to comprehend the current condition of my house.  I gave up on chores today and sat  down with my kids and played all day.  It was fairly decent when my dad came this morning to pick up Austin but progressively got worse throughout the play periods.  There are legos in the silverware drawer, crayons in the bathtub, matchbox cars in the formation of a rug in the middle of the living room floor, all of the fitted covers on the couch and chairs are either hanging off of its particular piece or abstractly placed over it.  I noticed a few dust bunnies today and ordered them out.  If they aren't gone by morning, I will charge them rent.  The kitchen sink still has the baby bathtub in it, the counters are covered with a collage of construction paper and old pictures, there is a pot of "afbet soop" (clean pot with foam letters in it) in the kitchen floor.  I had to wade through the toys on the floor of Isaac's room to tuck him in and decided to make a path on my way out.  Hubby will be home in the morning and when he arrives, the house will be perfectly placed....on the outside *grin* I will enlist Isaac to help me in the morning and the inside will be almost perfect.    Poor baby... Nicholas' little legs and right arm were swollen today.  This is a natural reaction to immunization shots.  He's been more of a cuddle baby today than ever before.  I love the way he can't get close enough.  Please don't tell my husband that I enjoy cuddling, if you ask him now he'd say that I do not cuddle. *laughs*  I've let him believe this for years due to the fact that cuddling leads to sex and when I want it, I want it, when I don't, I don't.  I just realized that I put my infant and sex in the same paragraph, I swear I'm not a perv.  Camping, without a camp... My cousin and his brand new wife came for a visit.  Sex was vetoed in the room that they were to sleep in so the smartass brought a tent to set up in the yard.  If you're in Mayberry and hear moaning and groaning, its not the wind.  This is yet another example of a man and his problem solving abilities.  I can see God now after he made man, I bet his first thought was, "oh damn I messed that one up, let me try that again - this time with a fully functional brain, a nicer shape oh and breasts!" Afterwards he must have been exhausted but decided to stop after creating perfection.  Afterall, we were the last thing he made before he rested.  Women are more solid than the earth, more beautiful than nature and smarter than men.  *laugh*  Isaac's bulge... Tim and I cut Isaac's hair last week when Tim was home.  It turned out really cute but we found a tick, that had latched on.  It completely freaked me out.  I went to get tweezers to pull it out and when I came back, hubby had already taken it out and burned it alive.  So I've been watching him closely to make sure he doesn't change physically, mentally or socially.  He developed a knot-like-bulge on the back/side of his neck.  I ask the doctor about it yesterday and she told me that all was groovy and to make sure to check it and told me what to look for.  It hasn't changed so we're all good!  Randomly... Last night I dreamed that I was the designer of a steering wheel for a car.  Imagine that!  I went through trial and error but ended up with a steering wheel that I'd love to own myself.  Instead of a horn, it had 6 small buttons - 3 on each side of the middle part of the wheel.  When pressed this is what the car did... 1 - said, "fuck you" 2 - said, "what the hell are you doing?" 3 - said, "that's it, I'm calling the cops" 4 - said, "pull over and I'll whip your ass" 5 - said, "where did you get your license?" 6 - said, "I hope you have insurance"  ~~happy

      The kids and I spent our fair share of time in the car today.  I live in the country, naturally country music is the only available -- unless you love the goldies *lol*  So we are listening to  urlLink 104.1 WTQR .  We are singing along and then the whiskey songs came!  "whiskey woman"  "whiskey lullabye"  I have to admit that my favorite drink, when I drink (rarely), is whiskey but why play them back to back?  It was a random thought that made me stop and think -- it hurt!  Onto the kids... Isaac ordered "cake sticks and cake juice" for breakfest.  For those of you that do not speak toddler, he really wanted french toast sticks and syrup.  When I ask, "and to drink?"  he answered, "tea".  I know you're thinking .oO NO WAY! Oo.  Seriously, he wanted coffee.  The kid is a bigger coffee freak than I am and is twice as horrible to deal with if he doesn't get it in the morning.  Austin had milk with his "sticks n juice".  Nicholas had titty with a titty chaser.        Toddler Coffee Recipe  1 leakproof cup coffee milk  fill leakproof cup half full with coffee, add milk to rim  ~~enjoy!    Next we had a race, a dressing race.  Can Austin dress himself faster than I can dress Isaac?  The prize was control over the remote.  I wish there was a way to put you guys in Isaac's room while we do this, it really is hilarious.  Isaac and I always lose, partly because he gets coffee before we get dressed.  Austin is convinced that he is faster than Superman.  After brushing our "teefers" we were whisked away in the land of Spongebob Squarepants.  I will not go off on this subject at this time but it will come soon!  While the kids watched Spongedork and Nicholas slept, I cleaned the kitchen, gathered the trash, cleaned the floors and straightened the bathroom -- you know, all of that fancy domestic engineering stuff.    Before I knew it, it was time for lunch.  Once again I turned to the boys for advice and recieved, "wurms and tea" as an answer, from Isaac.  Loosely translated "wurms" are really " urlLink Ramen Noodles " and "tea" meant " urlLink koolaid ".  Austin agreed to Isaac's suggestion and so it was, wurms and tea, for lunch.  Both of them ate well.  Nicholas had titty with titty on the side.  You'd think it was naptime by now -- as if!  Austin is, "too old" and Isaac follows Austin's lead.  So I command them to what I call, "whisper mode", which is quiet time where they don't go to sleep but lay down for 30 minutes.  This gave me enough time to get ready myself.  I don't wear make-up, putting animal fat on my face isn't my idea of pretty.  My hair is long (way down back but not over the bubble), red, curly and thick so I don't even bother trying to tame it.  Basically, I used this time to find something decent to cover the large thing that follows me around, ass I think it is called.  I ended up with a nice little rig that was comfortable but going through dresser drawers always reminds me of how large birthing children will cause your ass to be.  I won't mention the floppy or solid fat parts, at this point.   Note to self: describe "baby fat" in future blog    A the day races forward... After lunch, I packed the diaper bag with Nicholas on my hip and tit, Isaac on my heels and Austin begging for chocolate milk.  FINALLY we made it to the car, where Isaac just HAD to strap hisself in ~ loss of 5 minutes there ~ which was all good because I had trash to load, kids to cram and where the hell did I put the keys?  Driving carefully from point A to point B, then to point C, right before point D and coming to a halt at point E, we made our way through my errands and had arrived safely at the dr's office.  Nicholas got his 2 month check-up today.  As if the doctor poking and proding wasn't enough, he also recieved 5 shots.  Poor baby got 2 in each leg and 1 in his right arm.  I'm worried but I won't go into it at this time -- this post is too long already.

      Holy cow!  I went to make a comment on  urlLink Mynna's  site and it kept giving me a fatal exception error.  So I would back it up and do it again until it went through.  Now there are 4, count'em, 4 of the exact same posts.  As if that isn't hilarious enough, I tried to delete 3 of them and I'm getting the same error message.  The internet!  Go Figure!    FINALLY, it has taken my requests.  That server works like our government leader thinks.  ~~Sorry Mynna

      The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is that a Thank You is in order.  I have always had an internet obsession.  Through a 6 year natural migration, I've went through chatrooms, games, leagues, web design, graphics design and now I find myself blogging.  With the exception of web design and graphics design, blogging is the only NOT pointless thing on the internet that I've accomplished and it doesn't require anyone else *cheer*.  My prior escapade was what I refer to as the League Lead By Losers.  Don't get me wrong, not all leagues are bad, corrupted or mislead by administration and the members of any league are generally people with great personalities but I obviously have issues with the leaders of a particular league.  If you find yourself asking, "what is this league stuff?"  you are lucky!  Take my word of advice and do not seek to find the answer.  Not all was lost though, I met some online people that I am actually proud to say that I have an association with.  Would I call these people friends?  Since I don't use the term loosely, I'd have to say no but this may change if I were to ever actually met one of them.  So, thanks Jules, for this new addiction to something other than pointlessness.  Next order of business... Being that I am in the business of internet design, I see prospective business success in this blogging thing.  Now all I have to do is figure it out *lol*  There are still several things that I can not comprehend, this is due to my inability to grasp new things quickly.  I have a need to know the things I am involved in to nothing short of completion.  "Moped" would best describe the sponge that hosts my knowledge, "slow but dependable".  Once I invest the time to get to know something new, I boast to understand it as a specialist would.  Projects... No, I don't live in them but I have a few going.  I plan on adding "days since" counters to my blog page.  These counters will keep track of how many days it has been since I indulged in things that I need not.  Examples : "days since.." ; chocolate, sugar, fat, Isaac's diaper use -- to name a few.  I'm also working on a new design for the page, although I love the first one I didn't create it and that is a pain in my ass.  I'm not interested in any kind of anal play so naturally I will create my own design for this page.  Eventually, I'll be a Blog Expert and be able to figure out how to do it *lol*  ~~feeding my blog addiction

      It's amazing at how much more refreshed I am at 5:30 am with a few hours more of sleep.  It seems as though if I don't get into bed by 11:00pm, I can not function the next day.  Last night I was tightly tucked into bed at a decent time and this morning I feel great.  It's a good thing too because the kids and I have a very busy day today.  My house looks like Toys R Us hovered above it, ripped off the roof and puked throughout.  There are toys everywhere but the boys have been good so it is a fair trade.    Today is Friday, that means payday!  Pay days are usually looked forward to by most people.  I've never claimed to be normal though.  Payday here means;      ~the kids naps will be shorter, causing pissy moods      ~rushed lunch      ~bank visit      ~dragging the kids in and out of the car to pay bills that I        can't pay online  This fiesta starts when we leave the house shortly after lunch and usually lasts until 6:00pm.  However, since we  urlLink tamed the Food Lion  yesterday, we will be done by 3:00pm.  I guess the worst part about pay days are that I have to interact with other adults.  I don't like people.  The more people involved in your life or required to participate in your life, the more bullshit that you'll have to deal with.  I just don't like playing in shit so I don't play ~ if I can help it.  Friday's are unavoidable.  In addition to pay day, Nicholas has his 2 month check-up today.  I suppose I dread this most.  I do not like the sound of the "hurting" cry and I know I will hear it today.  Immunization is required to keep him healthy but it doesn't sooth him when I remind him of this fact.  I anticipate finding out his weight and height, I am going to guess 18lbs and 26 in long at this point.  It will be fun to see how close I am.    I hope that my sunny disposition will last through the attitudes of grown individuals that do not properly channel their aggression and/or stress.  ~~time will tell

      SUPER MOM! is tuckered out!  After staying up way too late, getting up early -- as usual -- and an eventful day, I'm plum pooped!  After the caffeine iv... While Nicholas slept, I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, living room and Isaac's room to a sparkling shine.  I gave the boys (Austin and Isaac) cereal and stopped to enjoy a cup o joe and another smoke.  Nicholas must have a "mom has sat down" alarm because it never fails, 3/4 through a cup and a smoke -- he wakes up starving. I fed him and put him in the swing while I finished the floors.   Then came the Potty Goddess... Teaching a boy how to potty when you can't stand up and he shouldn't sit down has become quite a challenge.  Timing is a definate must as well.  So I've got this whole thing figured out!  While Austin, 7 year old brother, is here I'll have him go to the bathroom with Isaac (under my supervision of course.)  This way, Isaac gets technique down.  For fewer "accidents", I've figured out that the commercials come on a regular basis every 15 minutes or so.  Austin, Isaac and I promptly go to the potty each and every commercial break on Nick Jr.  The only reward I will give is a hug and a kiss -- no candy in this house!  Wish me luck.  Taming the Food Lion... I ask Isaac and Austin, "what would you like for dinner?"  They looked at eachother as if they had just been discussing it and Isaac replied, "NACHOS!" with such enthusiasm.  I agreed with a little less excitement because we didn't have the ingredients for NACHOS!  It was off to the grocery store for us.  I forgot the list.  Isaac went into a cart and didn't like it very much but Austin offered to push him so that made things better.  Nicholas was in the stroller and away we went, to tame the Food Lion.  Down each and every isle, I told Austin what to get, Austin gave the things that we needed to Isaac who gave a thorough investigation to each item and dropped it into the basket.  We were a finely tuned family unit.  That is until we reached the cookie isle.  I refused to get Oreos and Isaac began screaming, "but you promised!"  Recalling my promises for the day, I couldn't remember that promise.  Austin then informed me that I promised them that we would make Mississippi Mud Cups.  I immediately instructed Austin to get the double stuffed ones.  Isaac was again happy but now Nicholas was awake and about to get angry if he didn't get his titty soon.  We completed the trip and no one got hurt - woohoo!!!  Score:  1 us  0 timeout  Wet~n~Wild... YES!  I finally reached the pinnacle of my day.  At 7:30pm every night, my house deeply sighs a sigh of relief.  This is the time that Isaac goes for his bath, Nicholas is in his swing asleep and the cat is full from dinner.  After Isaac's bath it is teeth, ear and hair time then clothes, baby, blanket, story and bed!  Isaac is done by 8:00pm and if my timing is right on, Nicholas is just waking up as I am walking back into the kitchen (where Nicholas' swing is.)  Then Nicholas and I go through his bath ritual, the machine is turned on and plugged in and he cuddling, suckling happily on my boobs until 9:25pm.  By 9:30pm, all kids are asleep and I'm exhausted.  Now for Happy Hour... Between 9:30pm and 10:30pm, I have ME time.  I sip my tea and smoke my smokes and usually play on the computer.  ~~Here I am!

      I've had 2 full pots of coffee this morning, this is me now - awake and alert - but earlier...  This morning, I rolled out of bed at the very early 5:30am and went straight to the coffee pot, which was empty.  I thought for sure that I'd pee on myself before I assembled a pot of coffee to brew.  After hitting the "on" button, I ran, very crosslegged, to the bathroom.  The tasks may have taken 4 minutes max but that was 5 seconds too long for Nicholas.  I sat at the computer while feeding him to avoid going to sleep with my breast in his mouth, it worked.  The starving infant latched on to my breast, sucked 4 times and went to sleep knawing on my nipple.  I allowed this while I waited on my coffee to brew and gently laid him back in his crib when it was done.  After tipping over a couple of matchbox cars and miscellaneous toys, I grabbed my favorite cup -- 20oz thin, blue, ceramic -- and hastily filled it 3/4 full with the pipping hot eye opener.  Then I dug through the fridge until I found the Hazelnut liquid creamer, filling the rest of the cup with it.  I skipped the spoon and guzzled my first cup down.  AHHHHH.  I lit a smoke while I carefully mixed the next cup.  This mother's peace = a cup of coffee, a lit smoke and peace to enjoy them both.  This 10 minute window of peace is found only early in the morning and is squeezed between the boys' schedules.  I look forward to the only grown up time that I get daily.  I may be conceited but these brief moments involves only me, my wishes and fullfills only my needs.  It's better than sex and equally satisfying.  --ready for the day

      I can not believe I've been messing with this blog thing in every spare second that I've had today and now it is cutting into my sleep time.  HELP!  I need aa for blogging!  In other news...  The kitchen timer is about worn out due to 15 minute repeated settings all day long to remind me to remind Isaac to potty. lol  Diaper duty was cut in half today as a result of the kitchen timer.  My nipples are still sore and red.  Extensive web searching paid off though.  Lactating Experts say that they are caused by positioning problems.  Off goes the pillow that I use to prop on while I'm feeding, so much for saving the arms!  Murphy (the cat) is still terribly upset that he can not go outside and roll in the mud puddles or run through the hay field and get stickers in his long fur.  He cusses me every time I enter a room and refuses to let me pet him.  We'll see how long this lasts though, I plan to fight back with the "no rub, no food" tactic.  Eventually, he'll press his fat ass against my leg to remind me to feed him.  Did I mention that I hate change?  I absolutely loath it!  It causes me to have to go around to my elbow to get to my ass but it makes me more comfortable when I don't have to go through a change.  I'm sure there is a term out there for this.  It's probably closely related to people problem that I have.  It can be blamed for everything that takes me longer to do, things I don't do and the things I will accidently forget to do tomorrow -- err today.    --Blogger Freakazoid

      Now that I'm blogging and understand the entire concept, I've taken the next natural step - purchasing a domain so that I can design my own Chronicles.  Duh - you have to get webhosting too.  Geez sometimes I only need 2 more pennies of thought but can't afford it!    As for my day... It began extrememly early, 5:30am.  Isaac slept until about 8:30am.  Nicholas was wide awake at the crack of dawn wanting to eat so of course I whip the tit out and feed the starving tot.  He is so cute and grunts when he eats.  I can get him to smile at the drop of a hat and he cries for me when he can't see or hear me.  Breastfeeding is going good.  It's naturaly and fun.  Sore, red, swollen nipples are no fun though.  This is the first time with this so I'm not sure what caused it.  I haven't had a monthly since he was born either.  This could be the difference.  Nicholas is my heart....  Meanwhile, Isaac - the best workout trainer around - had me running all morning.  "Don't eat the crayons PLEASE!" "Isaac, why did you pee in your pants AGAIN!?!?!"  "Fruit Loops are for your mouth not the cat's mouth"  are just a few examples of my cries for help today.  Isaac is my blood....  Today was the first day of hardcore potty training.     --Wish me luck!

      So I just found out about this blog stuff.  Of course it would be a day late.  Isaac's Birthday was yesturday, June 22, and he was 3 years old.  We celebrated with close family, his favorite food and the usual cake and icecream.  All went well and he enjoyed his day.  I went into greater detail on the family blog.  Now to convience him to use the potty all of the time.  *sigh*  --Super Mom

      Every since Isaac has ventured into the land of potties, he has discovered that nature is great and always ready to be watered.  Thus far, he has spread his scent on rocks, trees, flowers, bushes, Mom's truck tire and for the first time today, a mud puddle.  After peeing in the mud puddle he said, "there ya go, all full."  I couldn't help but laugh.  I am proud to report that since the PODs, Isaac has only wet his self one time and that was today at Mom's.  He had been off to town with my dad and had to go when he got back, only he couldn't get the door open fast enough and I couldn't get to the door fast enough.  As I opened the door, he was peeing and said, "I sorry Momma."  I gave him gum anyway because he was beating on the door with both hands screaming, "Momma, I gotta PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE."  Poor baby tried.  We took a nature walk today looking for burdock root.  This is a root with many healing possibilities and the one that I am interested in is the teething pain relief for small children.  Find the plant, dig the root, wash it in a solution of 3/4 water and 1/4 alcohol, let it dry and then string it, putting a snap on each end.  Put it around the neck of a child with teething pain and instantly the pain is gone.  No, I am not joking.  Nicholas now has his burdock necklace and doing great.  Some of you may wonder about the safety of such a device around the neck of an infant.  Do not fear.  The snaps hold the necklace until it is pulled on.  Should it get hung on anything, it will come off.    After spending the majority of the day outside, both of the boys were completely ready for their baths and beds.  Isaac was out 5 minutes after he laid down and Nicholas may have taken 10 minutes.    ~~life is good

      From  urlLink ALMTTR  posting for today.  DNC Gaffe  As john Kerry ended his speech last night, CNN was live on air when DNC Convention Director Don Mischer shouted the following, heard worldwide.  "Go balloons, go balloons! Go balloons! I don't see anything happening. Go balloons! Go balloons! Go balloons! Standby confetti. Keep coming, balloons. More balloons. Bring it- balloons, balloons, balloons! We want balloons, tons of them. Bring them down. Let them all come. No confetti. No confetti yet."   "No confetti. All right, go balloons, go balloons. We need more balloons. All balloons! All balloons! Keep going! Come on, guys, lets move it. Jesus! We need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, godd*mmit. Go confetti. Go confetti. More confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons."  "We need all of them coming down. Go balloons- balloons? What's happening balloons? There's not enough coming down! All balloons, what the hell! There's nothing falling! What the f**k are you guys doing up there? We want more balloons coming down, more balloons. More balloons. More balloons..."   Ouch!          Posted by Jeff   Ok, so potty training isn't all that different.  Just replace "balloons" with "pee" and "confetti" with "poop".  "Go pee, go pee! Go pee! I don't see anything happening. Go pee! Go pee! Go pee! Standby poop. Keep coming, pee. More pee. Bring it- pee, pee, pee! We want pee, (cups) of (it). Bring (it) down. Let (it) all come. No poop. No poop yet."   "No poop. All right, go pee, go pee. We need more pee. All pee! All pee! Keep going! Come on, guys, lets move it. Jesus! We need more pee. I want all pee to go, godd*mmit. Go poop. Go poop. More poop. I want more pee. What's happening to the pee? We need more pee."  "We need all of (it) coming (out). Go pee- pee? What's happening pee? There's not enough coming (out)! All pee, what the hell! There's nothing falling! What the f**k are you guys doing (down) there? We want more pee coming (out), more pee. More pee. More pee..."  Fascinating isn't it?

      While in the farmhouse, I had and enjoyed DSL.  Since we have moved, I've tried and tried to get DSL but no one offers it here, damn it!  So I was forced to get dial-up service and after not being able to connect faster than 28,800 BPS, I called Sprint to make sure that the line was set up for data transfer.  The service tech came out yesturday and told me that it wasn't the line.  I was totally bummed and described my problem to him.  The good thing is that Sprint requires a mileage log and I was 1/2 mile inside of the cutoff for DSL availablity.  He called his supervisor, who turned DSL on the switch box that I get my telephone service through.  WOOHOO!  DSL will be installed Monday of next week and I can NOT wait.  ~~loving good news

      Today has been normal again.  Isaac's PODs came yesterday and I waited until today to try them.  This morning when he got up we went into the bathroom and he used the toilet.  We brushed our teeth and got dressed.  He ask me where his diaper was and I told him that he doesn't have any diapers and he never will again.  He looked at me like I was joking and said, "we'll see about that!"  I inserted the POD into Isaac's regular underwear and told him what would happen if he peed in his underwear.  "Isaac, you have to use the bathroom now when you need to pee or poop.  If you pee or poop in your underwear it will hurt you.  Got it?" I explained.  "Yeah yeah Momma" he responded.  I laughed.  It wasn't a full hour after he had breakfast that he peed in his underwear.  He looked at me with eyebrows pointed together. He had the "why are my balls hot" look on his face.  He just stood there, like a zombie kind of and felt the heat getting hotter.  I watched him, trying not to laugh.  Finally he burst out, "help me Momma! It hurts!"  I almost fell over I was laughing so hard.  Then I explained to him that it would happen EVERY time he peed in his pants that he needed to go to the bathroom to avoid being hot.  We changed the POD and went on with the day.  He was using the bathroom on his OWN!  The entire time I was thinking, "thank GOD for smart people that invent things like this!"  We went to Mom's this afternoon and were outside for a little while.  While outside, Isaac recognized the urge to potty and told me to carry him to the bathroom that he had to go.  I laughed and told him to pee on a rock.  I pointed to a rock and he looked at me like I was weird.    "pee on that rock?" he ask me with a puzzled look on his face. "Doesn't matter, you can pee on any rock that you want to" I responded, again trying not to laugh.  He peed on the rock and it was the best thing for him.  It wasn't long before he was peeing on everything outside, rocks, trees, bushes, the tires on Mom's truck.  It was great for him.  When he talked to his Daddy tonight on the phone he told him, "Daddy!  I peed!  I peed on the rocks and a tree and Grandma's truck wheels and the grass, ok bye bye Daddy."  Tim was laughing so hard when I got the phone back.  I'm sure he peed soon after that conversation.  Potty training has just gotten better!  I recommend PODs to anyone who has tried and failed at potty training.  Nicholas is doing great.  After a few more days with Isaac potty training, I'm going to start weaning Nicholas out of my bed.  I know that it is the worst habit to start with a baby but I couldn't stand the thought of my little tiny baby in a bed all by his self in a new house.  I've been putting him in the bed with me at nights for about 4 weeks now.  He sleeps on his own during the day so at least it won't require a complete overhaul.  I laid off of baby food for tonight.  Now I need to wait to make sure he doesn't have a reaction to it and then we'll get to try squash!  My baby is growing up!  I noticed today that he is trying to sit on his own.  He can sit on the floor by his self for about 10 second before he falls over.  If he were 3 pounds heavier, I could put him in an upright car seat, instead of a carrier, and this would speed up the process some but he is not heavy enough to be in an upright car seat yet.  Tim just realized what yesterday was.  I wouldn't remind him just in case he forgot.  He thanked me for not telling him and apologized for not being here for me.  I dealt with yesterday ok, better than last year that's for sure.  Something else helped me with yesterday that I would have never expected.  I answered the questions of a couple who had recently lost a child.  The questions that they ask were not necessarily about Audrey but what happened after that.  Some examples are:  "How long did you wait before having another child?" "Any advice on how to deal with things?" "Knowing what you know now, would you have waited longer before having another child?" "How did you deal with your loss?"   It helped.  ~~much better thank you

      Today would have been our daughter's 5th birthday.  Most people would be busy in their morning getting the house decorated for the party, rushing to the grocery store for the cake and other food to be served, dreading the appearance of 10-20 other 4 and 5 year olds and charging up the camera to capture it all.  I'm not having a party, going to her grave or doing anything special to celebrate this day.  Some would question "why?" and it is because her death was the single most tragic event in my life and I refuse to celebrate it.  Visiting the covered hole where she was buried will only bring back feelings that I have tried so hard to forget.  I will never fully forget the events but it helps me not to relive them in full color memory often.    ~~I'll write more later

      Despite everything that can happen to a child, there is one thing in particular that most mothers dread and that is their child growing up.  The past week, Isaac has really tried my patience and nibbled on my nerve endings but today I realized that he was growing up and it was too late to stop it.    First thing this morning, Isaac jumps out of bed and runs to the bathroom.  No one told him to go and the PODs aren't here yet.  This impressed me.  My mom and dad came over for breakfast this morning.  I cooked bacon, eggs, homemade biscuits and my mom made gravy.  Isaac didn't want the breakfast that I cooked and told me, "Momma, I want no eggs, I want oatmeal, the red kind."  Strawberry cream oatmeal it was!  He ate his bowl of oatmeal and helped his daddy eat his 3 eggs over medium.  He insisted on underwear and had a few accidents but 2 of the 3 accidents were due to an occupied bathroom.  Groovy!  As a result of Dish Network installing my 2cd receiver, Isaac has had cable in his room for a few days.  Until now was not able watch it because he didn't have a TV.  Today we bought him a 19 inch used TV for not very much money.  He was totally excited about it and thanked us the entire way home, held the door open for his daddy to bring the TV and helped him set it up in his room.  It was the cutest thing, Isaac laid on his bed while his daddy adjusted the TV on his dresser and he would say, "to the right daddy", "no, to the left", "there ya go, right there!"  Since Isaac was 1 year old, he has gotten a hair cut about every 5 or 6 weeks.  I believe that if you make it important while they are young, they will grow up wanting to look acceptable.  Isaac sat still for his original hairdresser, Mullette, but she wasn't available right before his second birthday so we had to go to a barber shop.  A man named Kelly cut his hair and didn't do anything wrong, that I could tell, but every since then, Isaac has throw a complete and total fit each time we go near a place that cuts hair.  It was so bad that people would actually say either, "that's ok, no charge for this one" or "I'm sorry but after all that, I need more than the posted cost."  We always tipped big due to his behavior.  I've always cut Tim's hair so 6 weeks ago, after I cut Tim's hair, he wrestled with Isaac for me to cut his hair.  It took 2 of us, 2 pair of clippers, a wet cloth and a whole hour for me to cut his hair.  Tonight, Tim wanted me to cut his hair and Isaac needed a hair cut very badly.  The entire time that I cut Tim's hair, Isaac was in the corner of the "cartoon" room, screaming "no".  I dreaded cutting his hair, I didn't think that I had enough energy to do it tonight but, to our amazement, he sat still!  He cried the whole time and he had to sit on his daddy's lap but he held still and did exactly everything that I ask him to.  It took all of 10 minutes!  When I was finished with his hair, he jumped down off of his daddy's lap, grabbed my thigh, hugged it and said, "thanks Mom, that's better."  I was so proud of him and let him know how proud I was.  I don't keep candy around here so I gave him two pieces of gum as a reward for his behavior.  Nicholas is doing great.  I have to admit that I am a little worried about his weight.  He was 10lbs 10oz and 22 in long when he was born.  He is a few days over 3 months now and he is 13lbs 7oz and 26 in long.  It seems to me that he should be heavier than he is but the doctor and my breast consultant is completely satisfied with his weight gain and say that I should not be worried.  He had green beans again tonight.  You are only supposed to introduce new foods after you see how their little bodies react to the first food.  So far, Nicholas loves green beans and his body likes it too.  No reactions thus far!  ~~feeling motherly

      With the house warming party scheduled for this evening, I woke up this morning with an agenda and a tight schedule.  I knew exactly what I needed to do to get ready before the guests arrived.    The Bank! My first stop of the morning was the online banking center to check the balance on our account.  I almost shit a brick when I saw the balance in the negative.  I immediately went through, comparing my records to theirs and found MANY errors on their part that had cost me a fair amount of money.  After 2 hours and a few threats on my part, I was able to educate the bank on their mistakes, help them fix them and get our money back plus some. Problem Solved!  The Phone Service Provider! Due to the problem at the bank and my rising impatience, I noticed that I was lagging online while flipping between the online banking pages.  While on hold with the bank, I checked my connection speed and it was 28800BPM - for those of you who don't know, that's slow as hell - regular mail arrives before this speed does.  Then I was told that someone at the bank would call back in about 30 minutes, so I called my phone service provider and ask the repair guy a few questions.  "Is my second line set up for voice or data transfer?" I asked. "uh, it says 'voice' on my screen."  answered the technician. "This second line is specifically for my fax machine and internet connection, I asked for a data transfer lime to speed up transaction times, why do I have a 'voice' line?" I calmly asked. "Looks to me like someone messed up." Well no freaking shit your dork!  GEEZ! "Ok, I don't know what is going on down there but I want my second line to be data transfer, as I requested on my original order, this repair will be free of all charges and it will happen no later than lunch time tomorrow, sound ok to you?" I demanded. "11:45am tomorrow a good appointment time for you?"  he asked, with a shaky voice. "great!  See you then, oh and this is free of charge correct?" I inquired. "absolutely" he assured me.   Problem solved!   The Party... We invited 20 people that are more than friends, they are family to us.  Originally, we planned a b-b-q outside but the weather disagreed and forced us back in.  The party was scheduled to begin at 6:00PM and by 7:00PM, the only person that showed was my mother.  We got a few calls saying that it was raining too badly and they didn't want to get out in the weather.  I completely understand the weather thing but why does it have to do so on a day that I so terribly do not want to reschedule? Party rescheduled!  Nicholas and food... This afternoon, I gave Nicholas a "bitter biscuit" to aid him break those 2 little teeth in as soon as possible. He LOVED it! And tonight was the first time Nicholas has ever eaten baby food.  We started him baby foods as directed by his pediatrician.  I chose green beans and squash to be his first two veggies, which happen to be my favorites.  He ate about 10 good mouth fulls and wasn't too gross about it.   Pictures coming soon!  ~getting it done

      I love my children.  They are everything to me and I would do anything to keep them happy.  My adventure today involves the floor, baby powders, a swiffer, the cats, a laundry basket and a dash of insanity.  This morning, I had the usual coffee start with Isaac, all was well.  He actually laid down easy for a nap and fell asleep so quickly that I thought .oO Hey, I'll get me a nap in today too! Oo.  Nicholas and I curled up together in my bed and were asleep as quick as Isaac did.  Only we actually went to sleep and Isaac was faking it because I woke up an hour later to the "help" meows of Murphy.  I jumped out of the bed and ran into see what was wrong with Murphy.  Isaac had Murphy under a clothes basket that had been flipped upside down.  I paid no attention to the strong smell of baby powders tickling my nose as I unflipped the basket and swooped Murphy into my arms to love on him a little.  As I yelled for Isaac, I paused at the strong scent again and went to seek it out.  It didn't take but a second for my eyes to focus on the floor and the white footprints on it.    ok, I'm laughing too hard to finish this, I will do so in the morning though *laughing*  In the meantime - what do you think happened?

      *burp*  *deep sigh*  I have had one of THOSE days.&nbsp; The ones that you dread when you know they are coming, the same one that you love to watch end.&nbsp; Instead of going in order of my events, we are going to try doing each person, I may not leave anything out that way. *laugh*   Isaac:  I love Isaac's charisma.&nbsp; He is so full of energy, spunk and just enough curiosity to keep him in trouble with his overprotective mother.&nbsp; I have learned, through numerous parenting resources, that children go through stages of trouble.&nbsp; Isaac is now the following stages:  Defiance:     Your preschooler refuses to come to dinner when you call him, ignores your request to pick up his socks, and pushes his trucks down the stairs despite your repeated instructions not to. Why is he being so defiant?Believe it or not, if your preschooler is like most, he's much less selfish than he was at 2. He's also less dependent on you, a sign that his sense of identity is stronger and more secure. But that doesn't mean he's overcome his rebellious streak. In fact, "Defiance is how a preschooler asserts himself," says Susanne Ayers Denham, a professor of psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. So when yours refuses to cooperate, he's basically saying, "I don't like your rules."   Ignoring:     You ask your preschooler to put away his toy trucks because it's almost time to eat. But he keeps playing as though you'd never opened your mouth, or grunts "Okay" and plays on without budging. Why is he ignoring you?As preschoolers become more independent, they get better and better at tuning out what they don't want to hear. So try not to get too annoyed if your preschooler ignores you from time to time, says Roni Leiderman, associate dean of the Family Center at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. Of course, at some point your child has to listen to you and get ready for dinner. The key is getting him to cooperate while giving him space to practice his newfound autonomy.   Interrupting:  You're on the phone with a colleague when your preschooler tugs on your sleeve and bleats, "Mommy...Mommy!...MOMMY!!"Why doesn't she know that it's rude to interrupt? Because at this age, your preschooler's just beginning to realize that the world doesn't revolve around her. Not only that, her short-term memory isn't well developed, which means her impulse to say things right now, before she forgets, actually has a physiological basis. What's more, your preschooler's still figuring out that sometimes you have to finish tasks and talk to people without her involvement.The good news is that as her short-term memory improves and she becomes less impulsive, she will be more capable of holding onto a thought (though not for very long) while she waits for you to wrap up what you're doing. It's easy for adults to take for granted, but deciding when it's okay to cut in requires fairly high-level critical thinking. Among the things your child has to ponder when she wants to get a word in: Is it okay to interrupt when I'm hungry? When I need a tissue? When the sink is about to overflow? When the house is on fire? Understandably, these skills take time to develop, so try not to expect miracles.Of course, dealing with a preschooler who cuts in every time you're chatting with a friend or scheduling an appointment is exasperating. But if you keep her worldview in mind, it'll be easier to understand that she's not purposefully trying to irritate you. In the meantime, help your youngster form habits that will someday allow you to complete a sentence without stopping to admire the dead cricket shoved under your nose.    Experts say to deal with it this way:    Be understanding.If you ask your preschooler to come in for lunch and he yells, "Not now!" then cries when you make him come in anyway, try to put yourself in his shoes. If he's busy playing on the swings, give him a hug and tell him you know it's tough to leave, but lunch is ready. The idea is to show him that instead of being part of the problem, you're actually on his side. Try not to get angry (even if the neighbors are checking out the show your child's putting on). Be kind but firm about making him come in when he must.Set limits. Preschoolers need  and even want  limits, so set them and make sure your child knows what they are. Spell it out for him: "We don't hit each other," or "You must stay in bed after I tuck you in." If your youngster has problems abiding by the rules (as every preschooler does), work on solutions. If he hits his little sister because he's feeling left out at home, for instance, let him help you feed or bathe the baby, and find a way for him to have his own special time with you. If he gets out of bed because he's afraid of the dark, give him a flashlight to keep on his nightstand.Reinforce good behavior. Rather than paying attention to your preschooler only when he's misbehaving, try to catch him being good. When Suzi Prokell, of Richardson, Texas, spots her 4-year-old, Jacob, being nice to his little brother, Ryan, for instance, she goes out of her way to encourage him.And though you may be sorely tempted to give your child a verbal lashing when he engages in less-desirable antics, hold your tongue. "When a child behaves badly, he already feels terrible," says Jane Nelsen, author of Positive Time-Out and 50 Other Ways to Avoid Power Struggles in Homes and Classrooms. "Where did we ever get the idea that in order to make children do better, we first have to make them feel worse?" In fact, doing so may only produce more negative behavior.Remember, too, that disciplining your preschooler doesn't mean controlling him  it means teaching him to control himself. Punishment might incite him to behave, but only because he's afraid not to. It's best for your child to do the right thing because he wants to  because it makes the day more fun for him or makes him feel good.Use time-out  positively. When your preschooler's at the end of his rope, ready to bust a gasket because he isn't getting his way, help him cool off. Rather than a punitive time-out ("Go to your room!"), take him to a comfy sofa in the den or to a favorite corner of his bedroom. Maybe he'd even like to design a "time-out place" himself  with a big pillow, a soft blanket, and a few favorite books. If he refuses to go to his time-out spot, offer to go with him and read a story. If he still refuses, go yourself just to chill out. You'll not only set a good example, you might get the break you need. Once you both feel better, that's the time to talk to him about appropriate behavior.Empower your preschooler. Providing opportunities for your youngster to make his own choices allows him to strut some of his newfound autonomy in a controlled environment. Instead of demanding that he put on the jeans you've selected, for instance, let him choose between two pairs you've laid out. Ask if he'd like peas or green beans with dinner, and a story or a song at bedtime.Another way to help your youngster feel more in control is to tell him what he can do instead of what he can't. Rather than saying, "No! Don't swing the bat in the house!" say, "Let's go outside and practice batting." If he wants an ice-cream cone before dinner, tell him he can have a slice of cheese  or let him choose between cheese and an apple.Choose your battles. If your fashion-savvy preschooler wants to wear his green sweatshirt with his orange shorts, what do you care? If he wants waffles for lunch and peanut butter and jelly for breakfast, what's the harm? Sometimes it's easier to just look the other way  when he splashes in the mud puddle on the way home, for example, or stuffs his puppet under his bed instead of putting it on the proper shelf.Distract and divert. Avoid situations that might spark your preschooler's defiant streak. Why risk taking him to your sister's newly carpeted, lavishly decorated apartment when you can just meet her for a picnic in the park? How realistic is it to expect him to behave in a fancy restaurant or during an hour-long community meeting? If you happen to find yourself in a tricky situation, though, use distraction to avoid a head-on collision with your child. If you're walking through the mall and spy a toy store that tends to send your kid into a conniption fit, for instance, quickly steer him in a different direction or divert his attention toward the water fountain ("Wow, Jason, look at that fountain! Want to throw in a penny and make a wish?").Respect his age and stage. When you ask your preschooler to make his bed or sweep the porch, make sure he knows how. Take time to teach him new tasks, and do them together until he really gets the hang of it. Sometimes what looks like defiance is simply the inability to follow through on a responsibility that's too difficult for him.Finally, respect the unique world your preschooler lives in, especially the way he perceives time (or doesn't). Rather than expecting him to jump up from a game at preschool to get in the car, give him a few minutes' notice to help him switch gears. ("Aaron, we're leaving in five minutes, so please finish up.") There's no guarantee that he'll break away from his fun without complaint  in fact, he'll probably grouse all the way home. But as long as you're patient and consistent, your youngster will eventually learn that defiance isn't the way to get what he wants.   *deep sigh* Patience is on the "near to extinct" list around here but I'm trying!  I think I need more patience reading how "experts" say to deal with these situations than I need to deal with Isaac.  I wonder if these "experts" even have children and if so, how they turned out.  I am free spirited and very independent, so is Tim, so the fact that our son is does not surprise me at all.  I would love for my children to be as free spirited and independent as we are but complete with manners and morals.  I'm walking a fine line here and days like today make me feel like I should have put up a safety net.  Mr. Nicholas is a very loving child.  There is not place on earth that he would rather be than on my chest.  He doesn't even have to be eating anymore, he just wants to hang out on me all of the time and I, obviously, can not do that.  Since I didn't blog when Isaac was this small, I've forgotten when he grew out of this but each day, I give myself a little more time to do things.

      I woke up this morning very happy for no reason.&nbsp; My coffee pot didn't seem to take as long as it normally does to brew a full pot, my milk gallon was full, Isaac and Nicholas slept for a half of an hour after I got up.&nbsp; I was able to enjoy, not 1 but 2 cups of coffee this morning without interruption.&nbsp; The boys woke up happy also and Isaac went straight to the bathroom *woohoo*.&nbsp; Breakfast consisted of pancakes and we all sat at the table together, happy.&nbsp; Nicholas cheerfully gnawed on&nbsp; his hand while Isaac and I put down the pancakes and coffee.&nbsp; The cats were found nestled together under a blanket that is used for Nicholas a pallet during the day.&nbsp; The house was spotless before 10am and I'm almost done with laundry.&nbsp; I've already been to town with Austin, Isaac and Nicholas and it went quietly and quickly.&nbsp; Dish Network installers were early and left me an extra brand new remote control, which was originally lost and is supposed to cost $49.00 to replace, for free!&nbsp; I'm thinking that today must be Sunday -- that's how uneventful it is but I know it is Friday and it worries me that I no longer have a day to complain about lol.&nbsp; Never fear faithful bloggers, I will again be complaining about Friday's next Friday because I get to use a whole check for the house payment *laughing*.   Ok, so Mom calls and invites the kids and I to eat pizza at a local parlor, I agree and meet her as planned.&nbsp; Isaac, for some ungodly reason, decided to go buck wild in the pizza place.&nbsp; I tell him to sit, eat, laugh and act like I raised him.&nbsp; He straight out tells me "no" then proceeds to climb out of our booth into the next one.&nbsp; I'm feeding Nicholas and basically pinned in so I called him down the entire time that I'm trying to get out of the booth.&nbsp; Each time he sasses me and I've had it.&nbsp; I finally break free of the booth and lay Nicholas in his car seat.&nbsp; Finally, I gently take Isaac's hand, convincing him that I am going to show him the bathroom.&nbsp; He is overly excited and actually leads me in.&nbsp; Once inside, I start lecturing him on how to behave and tell him that I will whip him next time that I have to calm him down.&nbsp; To make sure that he understood, I ask him to repeat what I said and he said, "bashroom is nice, I'm not acting nice."&nbsp; Ok, so it is a 3 year old translation but hey, he got the just or so I thought.&nbsp; As soon as we got out of the bathroom, he went wild again.&nbsp; I ask him, "Isaac, do you want to go to the bathroom again?"&nbsp; He looked at me, a big grin came over his face and he started jumping up and down, "ya, I wanna go to the bashroom!" I couldn't help but laugh.&nbsp; Calmly again, I led him into the bathroom, lectured him again and tapped his diaper.&nbsp; Holy moly, you would have thought I tried to kill him.&nbsp; He came out of the bathroom screaming across the parlor to his grandma, "Gramma, Momma hit my butt, help me."&nbsp;   Deeply I sigh, tired and overcome with laughter.&nbsp; Now I wonder, should I stay at home until he learns how to behave in public or put him into public situations more often.&nbsp; These are one of the questions that the parenting book left out.&nbsp; Either way, I can not whip him and expect him to be quiet about it - he'll tell everyone that I did it.&nbsp;   ~~*laughing*

      I know that I've told you about my neighbors on my right, the lady with the dog and her hubby the perv, and if you will recall, I've said that the neighbors on the left had not noticed us.&nbsp; We have been officially noticed by the left neighbors, who consists of a very charming couple -- 92 year old man, Bill, and his 87 year old wife, Loraine.&nbsp; They are so cute!&nbsp; They still hold hands after 72 years of marriage.&nbsp; He pecked on the door with his fragile, wrinkled knuckle and was as surprised to see me as I was to see him.&nbsp; When I opened the door, he ask if my Mom was home.&nbsp; *LAUGH* Can you image?&nbsp; I thanked him for the compliment and invited him in.&nbsp; Thank God I had been cleaning all morning and the house was fresh and clean.&nbsp; I showed them into the living room where we all found a seat and had a nice little chat about being neighborly.&nbsp; *LAUGHING*&nbsp; The are cute.&nbsp; My grandpa was here and they had a lot to talk about, it was interesting from a "youngster's" perspective.   Great news!&nbsp; I prefer going barefoot and these hardwood floors requires daily cleaning due to the fact that I can not stand for anything to get stuck to my foot.&nbsp; I've been cleaning the floors everyday since we moved in and my cleaning time is now down to an hour!&nbsp;&nbsp; Whew, its not all that bad anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes it easier for me to clean the entire house and it not take me 2 days to do it!   Okay, so while cleaning the bathroom, I've discovered that a cat has been pissing behind my toilet.&nbsp; I am pissed, so I whip and spray (water in spray bottle) both cats, Murphy and the newest rescue, Bing.&nbsp; I explain to Murphy that I know he didn't do it but if he didn't want to get punished for it, he needed to litterbox train Bing.&nbsp; He meowed at me and I agreed that it was time for me to clean the litterbox.&nbsp; With fresh litter in the box, Murphy grabbed Bing up by the fat on his neck and put him in the litterbox and layed down in front of it.&nbsp; I'm not sure how Bing liked this, as I was busy cleaning something else, but I did hear Murphy hiss a few times.&nbsp; To my knowledge, Bing spent the day in the litterbox.&nbsp; I guess this is Murphy's way to litterbox train Bing -- I hope it works.   Speaking of potty training, I have officially given up on all practical potty training aids.&nbsp; I have tried everything from pull-ups to candy and I can not get Isaac to tell me before he leaves puddles everywhere.&nbsp; I got online yesterday to do a little more research and try to find new methods and found  urlLink PODs  instead.&nbsp; I think this is the one and we will all know when they arrive!&nbsp; I hope they work, Isaac is entirely too old and too smart to still be in diapers.   ~~enjoying the quiet

      It has been 2 weeks since we were in the new house and 2 weeks since Dish Network completed our move by installing a new dish on top of the house and reconnected our existing receiver.&nbsp; In the original install, we ordered 2 receivers to work 4 tv's but only received 1 due to the fact that our other tv's were in storage.&nbsp; The moving guys from Dish Network instructed me to buy a receiver and have them install it.&nbsp; Otay but after 2 weeks of research and countless hours on hold with customer service, I finally had enough of the run around.    Chick says, "I'm sorry Mrs. Semones but the only way for you to get another receiver, you have to pay $99.99 for the receiver and $49 an hour for labor to install it and if you don't have the proper switch, you'll have to pay to replace that also and all together it would be over $300."   "Do fucking what?&nbsp; Thank you for your time but I'd like to speak to your supervisor please.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; Thank you." I reply.   "This is Sandra, floor manager, our representative was not able to help you and the reason is because you have to buy additional equipment unless you want to wait a year, then we will provide equipment, installation and service package for only $5 extra each month," said Supervisor #1.   "Okay, thank you for your time but I'd like to speak to your supervisor please.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; Thank you." I replied.   *on hold for 17 minutes*   "This is Stewart, Account Supervisor --," is all he was able to say.   "Yeah well this is Mrs. Semones and if I don't get another receiver, installation, service package and any additional equipment for only $5 extra each month, I'm going to rip your fucking head off,"&nbsp; I said in a dark tone and strong voice.&nbsp; You have 5 minutes to do it."   "Please hold," said Stewart."   "Hi Mrs. Semones, I'm Michael in the Accounts Executive Office and you have been transferred to me.&nbsp; I have been told about your situation and I'm looking for the next available installation date.&nbsp; *short pause*&nbsp;&nbsp;This Friday at 2 o'clock pm sound ok?"&nbsp; Finally I was getting somewhere!   "Yes, great!" I was obviously pleased.   "Okay, all set then and all that you will be billed is $5 extra each month on your service bill," said Michael.   "Wonderful, thank you."&nbsp;   *click*   ~~very please Dish Network customer *laugh*

      I just realized that my entries for the weekend are not on my blog so I went looking for them.&nbsp; Apparently, I've saved them and not published them.&nbsp; I will blame this on being completely and totally exhausted.&nbsp; As much as I like posting at night, after the kids are all tucked into their beds, I think that it would be best to start posting in the mornings, before the kids wake.&nbsp; Since I haven't published the weekend events, I've reread them and I can barely follow the scattered thoughts and mumblings. *laugh* So for now I will post in the mornings, when my brain is fresh and my fingers are rested.  ~~more to come

      *whistling the theme song for Enzyte*&nbsp; I hope you all have had the opportunity to see the Enzyte commercial featuring Bob, especially the one that makes reference to wood.&nbsp; I feel exactly like Bob, not in that I took a pill and it enabled me to get ass, but that I don't have a complete understanding of my wood.&nbsp; My wood consists of my hardwood floors, brand new and shiny - or they were.&nbsp; Now that everything is unpacked and in a place, my house was looking messy.&nbsp; Messy like I hoped no one would drop by messy.&nbsp; After looking at it with my blurry morning eyes, I decided to clean up the mess.  &nbsp;  I started cleaning in the big living room, fondly called the "adult space."&nbsp; I straightened the covers on the sofa and chair, then dusted and picked all of the toys up, delivering them to Isaac's toy box in his room.&nbsp; I finished up by putting all of the glasses that my company used in the kitchen to be washed.&nbsp; Since I said that I have to ask, why can't people use the same glass over and over?&nbsp; Why must they use a different glass every single time that they get something to drink?&nbsp; Anyways, after the clutter was cleared and everything was in its place, I noticed that the floor wasn't shining as much as it should so I set out to clean, for the very first time, my brand new hardwood floors.&nbsp; I sat down the the pamphlet that was left by the installers and read each panel carefully.&nbsp; I learned that with my particular hardwood, that you should never wax it, sweep it daily and use a special cleanser by lightly spraying it on an 8ft x 8ft section and then use a special tool to wipe it up.&nbsp; This will keep the "luster."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Newly educated, I set out to find the special cleanser and tool to use and I actually found it in the place that it was supposed to be *go me!*.&nbsp; I used the stingy mop to "sweep" up everything, then cleaned the floor as directed by the pamphlet.&nbsp; It totally worked but it took me all day to do 2 rooms of the house!&nbsp; I am now thinking 'why did I so want hardwood floors?' because I didn't know how much more work they are than carpet.&nbsp; Sure, the spills are easier but sweeping everyday doesn't enthuse me at all.&nbsp; I will have to sweep daily due to the fact that I can't stand a mess.  &nbsp;  I did manage to get the kitchen completely cleaned up today though.&nbsp; It didn't take long, except for the floor *lol* which oddly enough is NOT hardwood.&nbsp; It is the linoleum stuff.&nbsp; I would have to guess that the reason it took so long is because someone, I'm thinking hubby, tried to sweep the walkways after they mowed Tuesday and decided that it wasn't a good idea, and left grass in my broom.&nbsp; Everytime I thought I had the floor swept good enough, grass would be all over the place.&nbsp; I ended up sweeping, mopping, sweeping again and mopping again.&nbsp; I've never been accused of taking the easy route!  &nbsp;  My accomplishments don't seem that much to me today.&nbsp; The "front" of the house is clean, spotless really.&nbsp; However, I haven't mentioned the visitors, family, extra kid, teething pain of infant and breast duties.&nbsp; I could go into it but I'm sure that you're not in any hurry to see a description of my nipples so I will skip this for today. *lol*&nbsp; In short, the kids are happy, the house is half way spotless, the family is content and I am one tired Momma.  &nbsp;  ~~peaceful

        I do not know where my day has gone,  But I'm glad it is not the only one.  Thankfully a week means seven,  And counting isn't required in heaven.  &nbsp;  I can't remember what I did today,  hopefully I had nothing to pay.  It saddens me to have missed it all,  for if nothing else my memory will fall.  &nbsp;  I wonder where my hump day went,  and how much money that I spent.  What I did and what I saw,  &nbsp;and how I dealt with it all.  &nbsp;  Perhaps I will remember tomorrow,  but then again I still feel sorrow.  Today is that day and I can't recall,  what my hump day was like at all.    ~~ a me original  &nbsp;

      The new day brought many more additions to the obvious moving situation.  The house is in fairly good order due in part to my loving husband.  Nicholas is almost 3 months old now and is beginning to teeth.  His gums are swollen and red, poor baby.  As a result of this, he finds gnawing on my nipples soothing and tries to do so often.  This gnawing is very painful and requires me to pull him off of my breast, hear him scream, explain "no no", give him the breast back and the cycle repeats.  I've consulted my online source for breastfeeding how-to's,  urlLink La Leche League , for a solution to the biting problem and found that children can not bite if they are truly sucking because of the position of their tongue.  Interesting stuff right?  Tomorrow I have a plan to breastfeed as usual but try to sooth his gums before and after with a cold washcloths.  Hopefully this will solve both of our problems - his gums and my sore nipples.  The screaming of your own child when he/she is in pain is truly painful.  Especially when you slept wrong the night before and your neck is stiff and causing a headache.  I've taken tylenol and received no relief.  I am convinced that a good night rest will help me with this headache.  Should it not be gone by tomorrow, a quick visit to my chiropractor will definitely get the job done.   As I stated above, the house is looking better but now it requires daily maintenance to keep its beauty.  Tomorrow I look forward to sweeping all of the hardwood floors, toilets, shower, emptying trash cans and the list goes on but it is of the basic domestic goddess variety.  ~~waiting for Calgon to take me away

       When you're smiling, keep on smiling,  The whole wide world will smile with you;  And when you're laughing (ha, ha, ha, ha!), keep on laughing (ha, ha),  You'll find the sun will come shining through!   But when you're crying (boo-hoo), you bring on the rain;  Stop your sighing and be happy again.  When you're smiling, keep on smiling,  The whole wide world will smile with you!    I am sitting here listening to Dean Martin's version of "When you're smiling" on my Windows Media Player.  His voice is like velvet.  I unpacked and unpacked and unpacked some more today.  I'm exhausted and find myself sitting here debating a cigarette before bedtime.  Half of me needs the minty refreshment and the other half doesn't want to move to get it.  ~~sleepy

      Perhaps my old place spoiled me -- it was 1 mile from anyone.  We didn't have any neighbors close enough to visit or interested enough in us to visit -- either way I was completely happy about this fact.   Now, however, we live 1 mile from city limits.  This means that we have neighbors so close that I can see their faces if they were to stand in their own front yards.  I am not at all happy about this.  I am not sure why other than the fact that most people assume that neighbors are best friends and bend over backwards to help each other out.  These are the same people the invite their neighbors to family gatherings, cook-outs, celebrations of sorts and other general crap that I have no interest in.  "Okay, you're my neighbor but that doesn't mean your dog can shit in my yard." I said.    Of course it was in response to my *right* neighbor as she walked her dog from her front porch, out of her yard, into my yard, where it proceeded to leave a huge, wet, stinky pile of shit.  It was proceeded by,  "The first time I step in dogshit, I'm coming to your ass!"  I know, I know.  I'm not the neighbor that most would want but show me a handbook that says I should be okay with a huge pile of dogshit in my front yard left by my neighbors dog.  The lady with the dog isn't half as bad as her husband/boyfriend/son.  I'm not sure who he is to her, nor do I care, but this dude has a peeping problem.  Our new bathroom, located on the *right* side of the house, has a fairly large window to peer from while you do bathroomly duties.  Several times now I have caught this male peeping into my window -- from his yard -- to see what I am doing.  I think I'll make signs as follows:  "Taking a shit" "Pissing" "Got any toilet paper?  I'll give it back!" "In the shower : viewing NOT recommended" "I'm constipated!" "Ew, it smells awful in here" "Damn, can you see the hair on my legs from there?"  A little harsh, I admit, but usually what people do in a bathroom requires the utmost privacy.  I'll let you know what his reactions are. *laugh*  The neighbors on the *left* side haven't even bothered to notice that we are here and I'm extremely happy about that.  I already like them because they are too busy in their own life to look in my window at ours.  ~~neighborly sign maker

      I am thinking that I feel pitty for the horse caretakers of the world for now I know what it is to push shit all day.    For the record, moving sucks.  My moving experience has been a very stressful one.  I'm glad that I didn't have internet access to write about it.  Finally everything is out of the old house and into the new one.  The move took so long due to a couple of factors, one of which was that my hubby only got to help me for one day and part of a night.  He and one of my cousins moved all of the furniture in hat time.  They finally finished at 2:30am and Tim went to bed for a couple of hours before he had to go to work at 4:30am.  It sucked for him and for me because that left everything but furniture to be moved.  *blah*  Another reason it took so long is because we tried to place everything in its place before going to get another load.  Yes, we moved the entire contents of our home in a Toyota pick-up *thanks Mom*.  It only took a day of this for my ends to be completely frazzled.  It really doesn't take much to get me fired up completely, including an attitude.  The final reason was that the help wasn't exactly free-thinking.  I appreciate the help but damn, if someone is going to have to stand over other adults and lead them hand to mouth on everything, stay home.  Anyways, I am now in my new new house and Hima, as soon as I get everything placed, I will surely take pictures and share the beauty.  My hubby will be home tomorrow and if we can get everything squared away while he is home, we're going to have a bar-b-que and will be inviting all of our closest friends -- next weekend when he is home.  ~~pray for my sanity

      My dream was for us to own our home.  With no current credit and no 20% deposit, I thought that we would be renting for forever.  My dream came true.  My nightmare is having to move all our stuff one last time.  Especially in this time of year, when I'm feeling especially gooey, now I have to pack all of the things that cause this gooey feeling up and see it again when it is unpacked.  Thankfully, the reality is that our dream has come true and once I chase the monsters from under the beds, they will be homeless while my happy little family enjoys the good life in a brick, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, large kitchen, den, dining room, living room, full basement, paved driveway, hardwood floored house.   Oh and for those that read my blog faithfully, I got THE house.  THE being the one that I wanted :D  For now, I have no time to blog.  I will have plenty of adventures to share once I have moved.  ~~following my dream

      I usually dread holidays, all of them, but it gets me excited to see the kids excited.  Today they were really excited for a number of reasons.  First of all, daddy came home from work this morning at 8:00AM.  I packed the kids up early and we headed to get daddy with a coffee in hand.  The "daddy song" was sang all of the way to get Daddy.  As we pulled in the driveway at home, I was reminded that we had to go to Grandma's.  Off we go, to Grandma's before we ever got the chance to get out of the car.  I went in the house and Tim went to help my Dad work on my Mom's vehicle.  The better part of the morning was spent this way.  I was surprised when my Aunt from South Carolina came in but I was happy to see her and her dog, Sammy.  I started getting a little antsy because I don't like people and suddenly my Mom's house was full of people. Including everyone there were 7 adults, 3 kids, 4 cats and a dog, it was time for me to go home.  Since Nicholas was asleep on Mom's bed and we only live 10 minutes away, I left him there long enough for Tim, Isaac and me to come home, change and get ready to go to the cookout.  I was torn between wanting to go and dreading the people.  We rushed back to Mom's, got Nicholas and headed for the cookout.  Thankfully, my Mom was driving her vehicle with my dad, my aunt, my cousin and his wife and Austin.  She is easier to follow than my dad.   It takes a good 45 minutes to get to the other side of the mountain were the cookout was.  It is a bunch of country folk, flat footing, horse shoes, eating and a touch of drinking were seen just about everywhere you looked.  Strangers treating strangers like family, kids getting along and running wild in the huge yard -- that's how it is in the mountains.  It had rained an inch before we got there and the fog was settling into the valley, it was truely beautiful.  The food was excellent and no one clinged to me, Isaac was behaving and Tim was happy.   The fireworks this year were a sight to see.  The fog in the valley made the perfect blanket.  As the fireworks went up and exploded, the fog would catch the color and held it until the next firework went off.  I do not think that I've ever seen fireworks like that nor will I see fireworks that ever match that beauty.  I am glad that my family and friends were around to see them.  ~~not independent and happy about that

      I really do hate Fridays.  I feel rushed, have to be around people and have to give those people money *laugh*. The good news is that our account is looking juicy after the normal bill pay.  It has been many moons since we had extra money after payment of the bills and expenses of living WooHoo for us!  So life is good.  The kids are happy, hubby will be home tomorrow, money in the account, full tank of gas and I have smokes.  The only thing that could be better is if *dreamy look in eyes* my maid, Maria, would get off of her ass and clean my house up!  I'm kinda glad we don't have a maid though.  I would hate to know that someone else picked up my mess everyday.  It would be groovy to have someone else be responsible for changing the litter box though.  Whew, Murphy has a skanky ass.  ~~happily tired

      First a little history... My husband and I owned a home once.  We moved in right before the birth of our first child, Audrey, on July 28, 1999.  Life was great for a little while but then our whole world fell apart.  Audrey passed away at 2 months and 27 days (October 24, 1999).  I hated life.  I had no desire to live or to do anything but be zombiefied for almost a year.  Then I got pregnant with Isaac and refused to get attached to him -- that went straight out the window as soon as I saw his sweet face(June 22, 2001).  Life was good again, until Audrey's birth and death dates came around.  Its like I always had an itch that I couldn't scratch --something in the background digging away at my person.  Tim and I went through hell and high water.  I couldn't deal with it anymore and left -- thinking that I was just completely nuts and there was no hope for me or us.  It turns out that as soon as I was free from that house, I was fine, so it is gone -- Tim and I have been happily renting for awhile now and fine with the whole thing.  Recently, I've been missing something.  Ya know the feeling like you haven't done something that you need to do.  Tim and I communicate every feeling every day so that we stay on the same wave length -- we have learned this is the best way to keep me from going insane again.  He has been trying to help me figure out what it is.  So we were driving about a month ago and saw a "For Sale" sign in the front yard of a pretty house.  It dawned on me that I have my family - hubby, kids, cat -, everything for a house but it is all incomplete because the house that we live in is not OURS.  I turn to him and tell him that it is time for us to have a house again - our own house.  He blinked a few times, agreed and ask me how we should get started.  A couple of days later, our landlord's daughter tells us that our landlord has broken her hip again and when she goes into the nursing home full time, the house will be transferred into her eldest son's name and he plans on flatting this house to make way for a hay field -- great news right? *laugh*  The very next day, I find a realestate agent and begin the search for a house.  We have looked a few houses but nothing really jumped at us, until today...  One day last week, when we went grocery shopping, I noticed that the same house that made me realize that I needed permanency in shelter was still for sale.  I wrote the number down and had forgotten all about it until today.  I called, left a message and expected not to hear from the owners because Isaac was "Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mooooooooooooooommy" and Nicholas was "waaa waaaa waaaa *hiccup* waaaaaaaa waaaa" the entire time that I left the message.  A chick called me this evening, informs me that she got the message and was returning my call about this house.  We discussed a few things and arranged to meet at the house at a specific time so that I could see the inside of it.    Holy shit!  First of all, after I parked and got the kids out, I looked back at the car and it looked totally like it belonged there.  Then I go inside and it is empty.  I blink a couple of times and suddenly I can see our crap in it!  I wiped my eyes and the visions went away but it totally freaked me out.  I told the woman that I could see our things in this house and she smiled really big after saying, "Well, that's important."    This is the house that I want.  It is in excellent condition, a great area, awesome view, only requires a fence to be completely safe for the kids and it is the right price.  Tim is working and he needs to see the house.  I almost can't wait until Monday.  I know that Tim will love it.    I try not to get emotional about anything.  I've stripped my life of all bullshit causing agents and prefer it simple.  I have learned that simplicity works for me and my sanity but I can't help getting excited about this house.    ~~cross your fingers

      I had Mom call me this morning just to make sure that we were awake in plenty of time to get woke up before we had to have Isaac to the doctor's office.  She called about 7:15am and I was already up feeding Nicholas.  After feeding Nicholas, I got out of bed, got dressed and had a cup of coffee.  Isaac was in the bathroom as I headed toward his room to wake him up and get him dressed.  Tim and Nicholas cuddled while I got Isaac ready.  Next I got Nicholas' clothes ready and dressed him while Tim got ready.  We were out the door by 8:50am.  Isaac's appointment was at 9:30am but we were supposed to be there by 9:15am to complete paperwork.  On the way to the doctor's office, Tim and I discussed the insurance and their negligance.  Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover our feelings, I am more or less pissed off about the entire experience.  At the doctor's office, we were first turned away by a nurse whose only explaination was, "go back outside and as far away from the entrance as possible with your children, now."  Ok.  We waited beside the car as we witnessed 3 very sick children being loaded into a car.  Their ages were probably 14, 11 and 6.  I couldn't see any rashes or bumps but I could see red swollen eyes, all of them holding their stomachs and the number of nurses that it took to load these children.  I could also hear a nurse giving directions to the hospital.  I thought twice about taking my children through the same hallway that these sick children passed through.  One of the nurses stayed outside and held the door open for a number of minutes before going in.  I thought to myself   .oO Is this really worth it?  Where's the backdoor?  Good thing we are early! Oo.  I covered Nicholas's mouth and nose with his blanket and Tim covered Isaac's mouth and nose with his shirt and we ran, like madmen, through the hallway and into the doctor's office.  It was a very dramatic 3 foot.  Once inside, I checked Isaac in and explained to the secretary about the insurance and she said that we would pay on the way out.  *sigh* I was really hoping that the insurance would have gotten on the ball to make sure that Isaac had coverage this morning.  We sat down in the "well child" waiting area and a few moments later, the secretary called Isaac's name.  "Just to see if it would go through, I put the insurance information into the computer and it took it." She explained. "So that means that we will not have to pay today?" I questioned. "It looks that way, if for some reason they reject it, we'll contact you for payment arrangements." She added. "Okay." I was really thinking .oO Hallafuckingluja Oo.  It wasn't a long wait before we were called back.  Isaac weighs 37lbs 7 oz and is 42 inches tall.  His blood pressure and tempurature were normal.  Throughout Isaac's potty training experiences, he has yet to pee in a bottle or cup.  Today he got to pee in a cup and he was very unsure about it.  "Isaac, come on baby, let's go potty."  Okay, so I was assuring him. "In there?" "Yes baby, in here." "Okay Mommy." As he started to pee, I caught it in the cup and he cut off his stream. "No Mommy, not in the cup." "Isaac, we need you to pee in this cup honey."  Oh PLEASE I was thinking. "Why didn't you say so?"  He grabbed the cup from me and peed in it like a champ. "There ya go Momma, you gonna drink it?" I laughed a , "no."  We were sheparded into a room to wait for the doctor.  We reviewed colors and shapes and Nicholas happy chewed on my thumb while we waited.  A nurse came in, not one involved with the scene outside, and checked Isaac's vision and hearing.  Then she stuck his finger and put a bandaid on it.  She left.   "Look Mommy, she put a yellow bandaid on my finger." Isaac pronounced.   The doctor came in, sat down with Isaac and talked with him for a bit.   "Hi, Isaac, are you excited about going to school?" The doctor asked. "Yes, I am going to ride the school bus." We all laughed.  The doctor checked Isaac over and Isaac fully cooperated with him.  He commented on Isaac's manners and how smart he was.  He signed the papers required by the school and wished us luck.  We checked out and left.  It really makes me feel good to know that Isaac has never been in a daycare situation and he is as smart as kids who have been.  I am concerned about his sharing techniques though.  He only shares well with his Dad and me.  He'll give Nicholas anything if he is crying *laugh*.  When it comes to other children though, he needs work.  I hope these lessons come easy to him with someone else teaching them to him.  Obviously, I ensure that he shares at home but he is accustomed to getting things his way.  Every since he was born, if he wanted something that Austin had, we, 9 out of 10 times, made Austin give it to Isaac.  I see now that we should not have done that.  It is not too late to change it though and I've been working on it.  Back then though, it just seemed easier.  After the doctor's office we went to the mall and bought a  urlLink Magic Eraser.   Isaac got crazy with a red crayon on his bedroom walls and one wall in the hall.  I've tried everything to remove the crayon.  Flat wall paint should be illegal.  Had the rooms been painted with atleast a semi-gloss, the crayon would have just wiped right off with no effort.  Painting is in the near future but even before we can paint, we have to remove that crayon and Magic Eraser was the only thing we haven't tried.  Then we went to our favorite local diner and had lunch.  As soon as we got home, 12:30pm, I started supper.  I love my crockpot.  I can create amazing meals without standing in the kitchen for hours!  This was tonight's supper:  My Tips and Rice Ingredients: 1lb beef roast, cut into cubes 6 baby portabella mushrooms, sliced 1/2 green pepper, sliced 1/2 cup of flour 4 cups water 1 cup uncooked rice  Directions: Season beef to taste and roll each cube in flour.  Put floured cubes into crockpot with mushrooms, peppers and 2 cups of water.  Set crockpot to high and cook for 4 hours.  Add 2 cups water remaining water and rice to crockpot with meat.  Cook 2 hours.  Serve!   I also fixed corn on the cob.  It was delicious.  After supper, I immediately cleaned the kitchen.  Tim and I played with the boys some and then it was bath time.  Tim gave Isaac a shower and I gave Nicholas his bath in the kitchen sink.  Both of the boys were out by 8:00PM.  Tim and I are doing the laundry tonight, together.  Tomorrow is Isaac's orientation at the school, 10:00am.  Wish us luck.  ~~super groovy

      The boys and I were up at our usual time this morning.  Isaac and I enjoyed our coffee in the dining room together and we had a conversation about school.  I told Isaac that he had to be good at school and use his manners and play nice with the other kids.  He nodded his head while I talked and only spoke to request more coffee.     After our third cups, I ask him, "Isaac, do you understand what school is and why you are going?"  "Sure Mom, I'm going to ride the school bus."  He replied.   I couldn't help but laugh.  I will probably have no other choice than for him to ride the school bus a few times but I will be driving him myself whenever possible.  I am not sure why he is so enthusiastic about riding the school bus.  He has only ever seen one when we pick up Austin from his school.  I didn't realize that they had made such an impression on his little head.  While he ask me about the school bus, I put on the pintos so that they would be ready when Tim got home from work at noon.   "Momma, does school bus have seatbelts?" he asked.  "I'm not sure Isaac, the buses when I was growing up didn't have them but I somehow thing that the bus wouldn't be safe with 20 or so 3 and 4 year olds on it."  I replied.  "Seatbelts so we can be safe!" He exclaimed just like Dora on the television, causing me to chuckle at him.  "Ok, I'm going to play."   Our short conversation reminded me of my school days and the most prevalent memory that I have of the school bus.  My mom was able to see my sister, brother and me off and on the school bus everyday but due to her work schedule she couldn't take us herself.  She would sit on the front porch in her pj's and robe and have coffee and a cigarette.  Our bus stop was right in front of the house and we usually just stood at the end of the driveway, all of 15 foot away from Mom.  She would yell at us to stand still or behave as the bus approached and then wave at us as we took off.  My brother hasn't always been the good looking man that he developed into.  Before he hit puberty he was shorter, skinner, has huge ears compared to the rest of his body and was bucked teethed.  These features made him a prime target for the older kids on the bus to make fun of him.  The fact that my brother was as feisty then as he is now did not help this fact.  Several of the older boys had been picking on my brother for a few days.  Mom had called the principle and the superintendent over the school buses and nothing had been done about these boys picking on my brother.  My mother warned every official that she spoke to that if it happened a third time, she would take matters into her own hands.  They assured her that it would be taken care of.  It wasn't.  My brother came home one afternoon so upset that it took Mom almost an hour to calm him down.  He explained to her that the older boys had given him a wedgy and that it hurt his butt while they were putting the elastic band of his underwear around his forehead.  You could see the anger in Mom's face.  Instead of using her free time in the mornings to call people that didn't care, she took matters into her own hands as promised the day before.  The next morning, she acted as if nothing were different and sat in her pj's and robe on the front porch drinking her coffee.  The bus turned the corner above our stop as usual and stopped in front of the house.  When the driver opened the doors, he laughed at my brother and said, "Good Morning Fruit of the Loom."  I'll never know what my mom's original plan was but what I am about to tell you is the absolute truth.  My mom came off of that porch with the fury of an anger God.  She pushed my sister and I up the stairs and grabbed the bus driver by his neck.  She pulled him off of the bus and took her sweet time, about 7 minutes, kicking his ass while the kids on the bus watched in amazement.  Once finished whipping his ass, she loaded him back onto the bus and looked at all of the kids, who were not quiet, and said, "if I hear one word from anyone before I park this bus at the school house, I will kick every one of your asses."  She sat in the drivers seat, finished the route and drove to school.  No one dare spoke a word, it was the quietest that I have ever heard any place.  The boys that picked on my brother sat in the back of the bus, stupid them.  When she parked the bus at the school house, these were her instructions, "Everyone but Bryan (my brother) and jerks A, B, and C (can't remember their names) can get off of the bus, have a nice day at school."  I got off of the bus, as instructed and went to class.  I do not know the rest of the events that morning but I do know that the bus driver quit, did not press charges and the jerks were kicked off of the school bus for the rest of their school days.  I know that Isaac won't be the one that other kids picks on.  He is very good looking and damn near twice the size of other kids his age, muscle.  I wonder sometimes though if I have put enough meekness in him to keep him from being one of the jerks.  If I ever catch Isaac being a jerk, I will cut him down in front of whoever it is that he was picking on.  Lord have mercy on his ass.    On with the rest of the day.  Mom came over at about 11:00AM, brought me a head of Virginia sweet cabbage and we talked some before I had to go get Tim from work.  Isaac through a hellacious fit because he wanted to ride with Grandma.  He rode with me.  We left to get Tim and planned to meet Mom at the grocery store.  Due to Isaac's little fit, we were a few minutes late picking up Tim but he didn't notice because he spilt coffee in the floor of his truck and needed the extra time to clean up the mess.  We packed his things into the truck and headed to the grocery store.  After shopping a little, Austin rode with us to the house while Mom went to deliver her groceries.  Once home, I started cooking, the boys went into the basement to play and Daddy played with the baby.  I cooked cabbage, pintos and tenderloin.  It was super yummy and we all ate so much that we needed a nap.  Mom and Austin left after dinner and Tim played with the boys while I cleaned the kitchen up.    Tomorrow is a busy day and I'd like to return from it to a clean house.

      With Isaac at Mom's, Nicholas and I slept in this morning.  Instead of being up at 7:30am, we slept until 8:00am.  I started gathering everything to get it ready to be cleaned and made my phone calls for the morning.    I called the doctor's office about the cost of Isaac's physical Monday.  Would you believe damn near $300 for a freaking physical?  I about shit when the chick told me that.  Now here is my position:  When I enrolled Isaac, he was put first on the waiting list because he is only 3 years old.  In order for him to get to go, someone needed not to show up.  2 kids did not show the first week of school and I was notified Friday that he would be able to go.  He can't go to school until he has a physical, due to the insurance having a lapse we have to pay for it.  The insurance will not cover Isaac until Tuesday and the next available appointment for a physical is in September.  We have only until Wens, to get all of the paperwork together for him to go to school or he looses his place and will be put on the end of the waiting list.  Our only option is to pay for the physical and hope that the insurance will reimburse us for it.  *sigh*  While I was on the phone with the doc's office, both of my dads beeped in three times a piece.  I was ready to kill them.  Hello?!?!  If my machine doesn't kick on that means that I'm on the phone and if I don't answer the beep, that means that it is an important phone call.  I have caller id so wait for me to call you back!  Men, bless their ignorance!  Due to the phone calls, I only managed to get the kitchen clean before Mom got here with Isaac.  He was so whinny that I laid him down for his nap.  It didn't take long for Nicholas to go to sleep and by 11:00am, my house was silent.  So silent that I too had to take a nap.  After naps, I got up and cleaned the house.  I started in the bathroom and did everything in there except the shower - hubby does the shower.  Then I moved to Isaac's room, Nicholas's room, our room, the hallway, cartoon room, dining room and finally the living room.  I only lack the kitchen floor but I was tired!  Tomorrow, I will only have to take all of the trash that I bagged up today downstairs and wash the breakfast dishes.  I will also need to start the pintos in the crockpot as soon as I get up so that they will be ready when hubby gets home at noon.  I tried a new bath time ritual tonight.  I usually make Nicholas a pallet in the hallway while I put Isaac in the shower and get soaked.  Then I get Nicholas up off of the pallet and lay him on Isaac's bed while I dress him, read his story and put him in the bed for the night.  Then I usually give Nicholas a bath in his baby bathtub in the kitchen sink, get soaked again and dress him, feed him and put him in the bed.  I'm usually so tired after that so I don't get a bath for myself until the mornings.  Tonight though, I stripped Nicholas down to his diaper and made his pallet in front of the shower.  I covered him up well to make sure that he didn't get cold while Isaac and I took a shower.  Isaac got out of the shower and I wrapped him in a towel.  I got his toothbrush ready before we headed to the shower so once he was out, he could brush his teeth while I bathed Nicholas in the shower with me.  I took Nicholas's diaper off and gave him a bath in the shower.  Once he was finished, I laid him back on his pallet and covered him with a towel while I dried off.  Then I put my robe on, picked up Nicholas and took him to Isaac's bed and dressed him while Isaac dressed.  Next I nursed Nicholas while I read Isaac a story and both of the boys were asleep by 8:15pm.  I started at 7:30pm.  I usually have to start at 7:00pm and done by 8:30pm.  I'm liking this new ritual - it doesn't take a long and I get a shower in.  Hee yaw!  ~~feeling super

      Ah Fridays, gotta love Fridays especially when the date is the 13th.  I figured that this day would be hell from the start and I was glad to be wrong.  Don't tell anyone that I was wrong though because that would be a flaw and I don't have those.  *laugh*  After the usual morning ritual, the boys and I had breakfast.  Isaac ordered, "pancakes, apples and toast."  Tim called and we had a conversation that was too short because his cellphone is a piece of shit and is due for an "phone upgrade."  I go to know SprintPCS's phone upgrade policy today really clearly.  It seems that 18 months after your open your account, you get a free phone upgrade.  You are eligible every 18 months after that.  The only exception to these rules occurs when you have to get a replacement phone due to your phone being malfunctioned.  If you think your phone is malfunctioning, you have to take it to a SprintPCS store and have it tested.  Once it is determined that your phone is malfunctioning, SprintPCS sends you a new replacement phone, same model that you have.  When you receive and activate the replacement phone, you have to send your malfunctioned phone back and your 18 months starts over once you have activated the replacement phone.  Wouldn't you know that Tim would have been due an upgrade in April, had he not had to get a replacement phone in February.  Damn the luck!  I gave the SprintPCS chick a piece of my mind.  Next I had the pleasure of talking with the bank again because they have messed up our account AGAIN.  All of our bills that can be paid electronically are paid electronically automatically.  Due to our account being fucked with no end in sight, I got to run bills today.  Let me remind you that Isaac has a 10 second warning on potty use and Nicholas prefers being held.  I can not express the joys it was to run to 5 different places, get out, unload both kids, pay the bill, load the kids again, listen to Nicholas scream on the way to the next place and then do it all over again.  Of course Nicholas calmed down once he was in my arms and Isaac had to pee in every bathroom that he passed.  Very interesting but I do not recommend it to anyone.    Before we got home from running bills, I called the insurance company, who have dropped Isaac off of the insurance for "neglecting to turn in paperwork."  It seems that you have to renew children every year on their birthday and even though I waited 45 minutes to turn this paperwork into a specific woman at the insurance company, she lost it and Isaac was dropped.  This could not have come at a worse time.  Isaac is going to school Wens.  He has a physical on Monday and no insurance to pay for it.  He can not go to school until he gets a physical and he will lose his place if he can't start on Wens.  Gotta love spur of the moment "holy shit" problems.  So we ended up going to the insurance place and waiting for what seemed forever to do the paperwork IN the building and get it into the computer.  There is no guarantee that he will be on the policy on Monday though.  I have absolutely no idea how much a school physical is so I called the doctor's office to ask, in the event that Isaac is not on the insurance before Monday at 9:30am.  On Fridays, the doctors office closes at 4:30pm and I called at 4:32pm.  *sigh*  Luckily, they are open in the morning from 8:30am to noon.  Remind me to call please!  After an exhausting afternoon, I go to Mom's.  Isaac and Austin rarely get to play together anymore and jump at the chance to do so.  All Isaac talks about is Austin and one would think that they would use their time together wisely and play their little hearts out but nooooooooo, they usually argue like brothers the whole time.  We sent them outside so that we could talk.  We talked for awhile inside but decided to go walking outside and we did.  Nicholas fell asleep in the stroller as we walked around Mom's house looking at the flowers.  Isaac spent the night with Grandma and Nicholas went right to sleep tonight.  It has been a peaceful night and I have only gotten Isaac's linens and curtains washed, ironed and back where they are supposed to be.  Hopefully the quiet morning will allow me to get some things done before Grandma brings the boys over.  Hopefully Austin can spend the night tomorrow night and Mom can get a break too.  ~~tired but ok

      This morning the boys and I cuddled some before we started our day.  Mom called early to make sure that I was awake so that I could get to her house early.  My dad was there and wanted to see the kids and me.  We got up and dressed and made it to Mom's by 8:30am.  We visited for awhile and was home again by 11:00am.  When we got home, I put the boys down for a nap.  Isaac got up several times before I finally had to harshly suggest that he lay down.  The problem is that if Isaac isn't asleep, he'll wake sleeping Nicholas.  I have to hold Nicholas until Isaac is asleep and then I can lay Nicholas down.  Sleeping times are definately interesting around here.    Isaac and I went over his colors after nap time.  I bought a pound of scrapbooking paper in various sizes and cuts.  It has the basic shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle) and basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black and white).  These packs are available at Wal-Mart and costs less that $2.00.  I ordered mine offline *laughs*.  They are great for teaching kids their colors and shapes.  I chose the largest squares in the basic colors for myself.  Isaac always choses the triangles for himself.  I lay down a color, he says the name and then puts the same color triangle down on my square.  It's kind of like a kids version of Go Fish.  We've played this game for about a year now and we are on our second pound of the paper.  Today we did shapes too.  This is new, I've only started this about 6 months ago.  It works the same way that the colors do but in shapes.  After playing "Go Fish", we always make something with the now crumbled scrapbooking paper.  Today he made his daddy 2 boats and 2 flowers for me.  He is so cute when he is good.  To show him how proud I am of him, I put mounted the flowers and boats onto magnets and hung them on the fridge at his level.  He then informed me that he needs to make water for the boats and grass for the flowers and the water needs to be blue and the grass is green, unless I prefer brown.  Little shit!  He also refused to stay clothed today.  I don't know what this new phase is or why it is happening now but I'm going with it for the time being.  He has every right to walk around in his underwear in his own house.  Nicholas is having a hard time with cutting teeth.  His necklace works great but he is knawing on everything in sight.  I'm glad he doesn't have the usual crying associated with the pain of teething and this because of his burdock root necklace.  Would you believe that he prefers knawing on his own feet over my nipples.  I'm loving this!  ~~blessed

      This morning I woke to a fresh pot of coffee and a husband ready to go to work.  I was served coffee in bed and allotted 15 minutes to enjoy it.  Tim got Isaac dressed for the day and I cuddled with Nicholas just a little bit longer.  We packed Tim up and drove to the truck yard.  Tim has a new co-driver because his co-driver for the last 8 months quit on Monday.  We still haven't figured out why he quit and honestly I really don't care.  It was stressful trying to talk to Tim on the phone because every time Tim called me and James knew about it, he would call his wife and they argued worse that any couple that I've ever encountered.  I could never hear Tim.  Thus far today, I have not had that problem and it has also lifted the load.  Communication is important *laughs*.    After dropping Tim off, we came back home and while the boys napped, I cleaned the house.  It looks good.  I plan on washing and ironing curtains and bed linen tomorrow, wish me luck.  The kids and I went to Grandma's tonight for a little off time.  I promised Isaac that if he laid down for a nap, I would take him to the park.  It rained cats and dogs while he was asleep so the park was out.  Grandma's is as good and I explained the whole thing to him.  If you learn nothing from my blog but this, remember it for life.  The key to raising happy children is consistency.  If you tell them that you'll do something.  Do it or in cases that you can't (like my park promise today) come up with something better and give them the option.   ~~happy again.

      Okay so last  urlLink Tuesday , I told you that I had figured out my problem but was going to wait until I had confirmation.  I now have confirmation that I am not a whack job, crazy or otherwise out of my mind.  Good news right?  One may assume that it is good news however I also confirmed today that I have serious issues that need my direct and full attention. I say this because...  Today I saw a head shrinker, some of you refer to these people as "physiologist."  I did this because of some feelings that I just can't shake.  I've never really dealt with my daughter's death and thought that this was probably a good time to do so.  Due to my never dealing with Audrey's death I have a few problems now:   inability to deal with and control anger  anxiety in large crowds  emotional blocks  overprotective with my kids  disgust of my husband  no fear, natural or otherwise  uncontrollable and frequent mood swings   That is quite the list but the good news is that I won't have to take out a second mortgage on my house to pay for the shrinker bills.  So here's the basic rundown of my explanation on the above problems and how they are directly linked to the death of my daughter.  I was completely alone when I discovered our daughter in her lack of life state.  My mother was returning from vacation, my husband was working and no other family or neighbors were around.  I think that I blame my husband for not being there when the discovery was made.  After her death, I would avoid high crowd areas due to the possibility of seeing a red headed little girl that would be her age.  I wanted to avoid such sightings due to my freaking out in public.  I already had/have a problem with needing to be in control and I can't control anyone but myself so the thought of losing control in front of any number of people freaks me out.  After having Isaac, I developed the over protectiveness of my children.  It was ok with Isaac but I fear that I've gone overboard with Nicholas and it could end up effecting his life.  The anger has grown and grown, almost like the snowball effect.  My mood swings have gone from natural to above average as a result of not dealing with anything related to this and as a result of that, I have developed a fear of nothing and no regard towards the emotions of others.    *takes a deep breath*  Now that this is out of my system, I'll tell you about the rest of my day.  I got a call from the preschool coordinator today regarding Isaac going to school.  When we registered him, he was put first on the waiting list for enrollment due to his age and the fact that there were 4 year olds and they are priority.  So this chick calls me today and tells me that school started today and 2 kids didn't show up.  One of the kid's parents called and the other hasn't been heard from and can not be contacted.  Should the kid whose parents can not be contacted doesn't show up for school, Isaac will be able to go and could start as soon as Thursday.  She prefers that he start on a Monday though.  This would mean that I will be able to get back to work and have personal goals again.  Woohoo!  ~~content

Today was a very average day.  I got up, cooked, cleaned, cooked again, cleaned some more, cooked again and finally cleaned again.  In between the cooking and cleaning I breastfeed, changed diapers, assisted Isaac with his potty problems and held conversations with Tim.  We went on the trail walk today and it was fun.  Isaac is doing great with potty training, Nicholas is still terribly attached to his mother that likes him being terribly attached to her and Tim is still wondering when I will give him ass.  ~~all is well!

      I did not get enough sleep last night to carry me through the day, or so I thought.  The last time that I recall was 1:30AM on the alarm clock.  Tim called this morning at 5:30AM, "good morning honey, I'm 45 minutes out, you can be early if you want, I've got the paperwork just about finished."  I will not share my reply with you *laughs*.  It took me a few moments to roll out of bed and get dressed myself.  I was unable to enjoy even a cup of coffee because I forgot to set the automatic timer on "ass crack of dawn" instead of its usual setting, "rooster crow."  After dressing myself, I packed the boys up and headed out the door.  I was loading the boys when I felt a pop on my chest, twice.  Upon looking at my chest, I discovered that my nipples were standing out, for what seems like, 2 inches.  It may have been to the lack of coffee or lack of sleep the night before but I couldn't figure out why they were in this condition.  Until of course, I stopped and looked at the ground and a cold breeze blew through.  Yikes!  Another inch was added to my newly deforming breasts.  Holy cow it was cold this morning, about 42 degrees F.  While strapping the kids into the car, as fast as I could, I pondered why I chose a sleeveless shirt and stretchy pants to cover me this morning.  This pondering continued on the 5 minute drive to Tim's work.  Here are some of my thoughts:    1.) I know better than to wear sleeveless shirts. 2.) Look at these arms, GROSS! 3.) An ass as big as mine should not have only a thin layer. 4.) I'm throwing out these pants when I get home. 5.) I wonder if the big bang theory was first thought of due to the designer seeing a fat chick in black stretchy pants bending over.   Once we arrived at the truck yard to get Tim, Isaac decided that he just had to pee on the huge tires on Daddy's truck.  I got him out to pee, not knowing where he was going to point that thing.  Tim was watching us in his side mirrors and decided to get out and help Isaac pee.  I quickly got back in the car and turned on the heat, in an attempt to thaw my frozen breasts.  I watched as my two favorite men peed on the tire of an 18-wheeler.  Men!  Isaac went with his Daddy into the truck after that.  I was waiting, not so patiently, when I looked down at the dash of our car and watched as the fuel light came on.  Instead of getting out into the cold again, I used my cellphone to call Tim's cellphone and I told him that I was going to get gas.  He replied, "You don't need to pay for it, I have enough for you, me and the car."  Again, I will not give you my reply to that.  He quickly told me, "ok honey, be careful and we should be done when you get back."    The gas station was 2 minutes in the direction of home.  I pulled in and jumped out, trying to hurry to pump the gas.  As soon as I landed the nozzle into the gas tank and set the automatic pump, I crossed my arms in an attempt to keep my breasts from freezing again.  It did not work.  When finished, I pulled the car up to the store and got out to pay.  As I walked into the store, there were several old timers in the corner huddled around the coffee pot.  One had his back to me, putting on a fresh pot, and I heard him say, "it should be against the law for a woman with an ass like that to wear those kind of pants."  The other men blushed a little and one nudged the coffee maker.  He turned around to see me and turned red as a beet.  I said, "I thought the same thing this morning.  I wondered how I could fit such a thing into pants so small."  He turned even more red and said, "I don't know how you did it but I like the look."  I smiled at him, paid and walked out -- trying not to shake my ass.  I climbed quickly back into the car and thanked God that they noticed the stretch of fabric over my ass instead of my 3 inch protruding nipples.  At the truck yard again, Tim and Isaac loaded Tim's things into the back of the car and got in themselves.  Both of them buckled up and Tim was laughing while I told him what happened at the store.  He agreed that the pants looked nice and told me, "you should be ashamed of yourself for giving those men a thrill so early in the morning."  I rolled my eyes and headed to our favorite restaurant.  We sat at our favorite table and Isaac's favorite waitress came over to the table.  "Good morning, coffee this morning?"  she said. "good morning," Isaac said, "I'll have coffee with real milk in a go cup, a pancake and some of Daddy's eggs."  Everyone laughed and she patted Isaac on his head.    After breakfast, we headed to Virginia to visit one Emma and Ellis, Tim's aunt and uncle.  Emma is amazed that there are so many things that I haven't tried.  She always keeps something new there for me to try and this week it was real butter.  This butter was straight from the churn, where it was made with pure cream on top of fresh cow milk.  Concerned about my heart, I tried to decline the invitation but "no" isn't something that you tell this woman.  The butter absolutely fabulous.  I couldn't believe how creamy and sweet it was.  I am also glad that real butter isn't available in the grocery store.  Everyone was impressed with Isaac's manners and the "smartness" of Nicholas.  Milestone of the day: Nicholas found his feet and is fascinated with them.  ~~happy

      This morning, my dad came to get Isaac.  Nicholas and I did a number of household chores including all of the laundry, cleaning out the fridge and doing the floors.  We also took a very long and needed 4 hour nap.  Oh yes, I did enjoy that nap!    Due to the nap that I took, I am unable to sleep now.  This is probably a good thing due to the fact that I wouldn't have blogged tonight had I been sleepy.  The extra sleep also has my creative wheels turning.  Its almost time for me to start working again.  Work?  Yes, I work.  I am the owner of an internet business, I make webpages and graphics.  I have hired an independent graphics artist though and I think she is going to work out great.  She has a great eye for color and is using her own time to learn to do graphics.  So, as my wheels are turning, I decide to look into the business of blog templates.  I am very impressed with the findings and have started designing a few of my own.  In the coming days, do not be surprised if the appearance is a little or very different.  If you like the design of the day, let me know.  If you would like me to design you a blog page (free of charge of course) also let me know.  I am working on one called "Pumpkin Spice" at the moment.  Orange is my favorite color and I want to use orange and yellow as much as possible.  I can't wait to see how it turns out!  ~~excited!

      Once again I got up cleaning.  I managed to get the front of the house (kitchen, cartoon room and the living room), the litter box and the beds made before Mom and her 3 cats got here.  Mr. Daisy, Thunder and Lightening didn't want to meet Murphy but were already acquainted with Bing.  Murphy and Bing are our cats.  To say the least, the house was rocking with 5 male cats running around.  We had planned on Mom playing with Nicholas while I cleaned out the fridge and things of that nature.  Plans never go as follows, it seems.  I didn't get anything clean and she didn't get her cats washed at my house but we had an awesome lunch. *laugh*  We had four cheese mashed potatoes, grilled stuffed salmon and corn.  It was SO good and very different.  It was then that I realized that lunch was an "adult" meal and I had not enjoyed one in a long time.  Mom took Isaac home with her and I set out with Nicholas to get payroll and go to the bank.  We've been having a lot of problems with our bank and it was discovered last night that they had once again taken money out of the account that wasn't our charge.  As I went through the drive-thru, the head teller came to the window and invited me in.  I planned on doing that anyway but wanted Nicholas to get 5 more minutes of sleep before he felt me get totally stressed out from resisting to kick someone's ass.  We slide into the bank and went in.  I acted as professional as I could and after 3 hours with the branch manager, it was proven that we had not made the purchase and the bank owed us $390.  They immediately put the money back in our account and letters were written to everyone we had a problem paying as a result of the bank's error.  After the bank, it was rush rush rush to the phone company and ultimately to Mom's.  To deliver her cats and pick up Isaac.  The rest of the night was ordinary, dinner, dishes, baths and bed.  ~~relieved

      I had a busy day but the only thing that really sticks out in my mind was the fact that I could not quench my thirst.  I drank and drank and drank, water, soda, tea, coffee and nothing helped.  It seems as though I spent the day drinking and peeing but I actually had a pretty full day.  I got up early this morning and picked up around the house before I got the kids up and ready to go.  By 8:30am, I was out the door and headed to the next town to pick up a friend and take him to the food bank.  He and his wife are having a rough time of it and they only have 1 car.  Her hours at work prevent him from getting things to help them so he called me last night and ask if I would take him.  Of course I will and I did.  We were at the food bank by the time the doors opened at 9:30am.  Isaac had to pee on a huge rock behind the center.  The wonder boy and nature are liking eachother.  By 12:00 noon, I had delivered our friend and his supplies back home and was home myself.  No time for a nap because I had to finish cleaning the house before a chick was coming over for the very first time.  I did not want her coming in thinking that I didn't do the floors - ever.  I got busy right away on the floors and had them completely finished within an hour and a half.  With 30 minutes to spare, I was able to clean up the lunch dishes.  I met this chick Monday at Nicholas' appointment.  She is 38 years old, in better shape than me, the mother of a 7 year old boy, 5 year old little girl named Rose, who has downs, a 3 year old little boy and a 3 month old little girl.  She's my hero of the week.  She dropped by to get a pack of PODs for Rose and while she was here, I unloaded 4 cases of formula on her as well.  Tim and I stocked up thinking that breastfeeding wouldn't fly with Nicholas either.  Thankfully I am able to breastfeed.  I thought she was going to cry as she left.  I explained that it wasn't charity because it was helping me as much as it was her.  Now onto the rest of the day, in shorthand.  Dinner, dishes, baths, beds and sleep -- finally!  ~~feeling good

      Today didn't start out as good as it turned out.  It turned out groovy though.  I figured out what my problem is but I'll wait to have it confirmed by a professional before I share.  ~~still breathing

      Prepare yourselves for the first bitch fest on this blog.  If you are weak, meek, timid or have stomach complications, please wait for tomorrow's post.  I'm sure I'll be over it by then.  First of all... Tim is home.  Most women love their husbands being home, certainly if you love your husband as much as I do.  This week though, he is just rubbing me the wrong way.  I love my husband so much that I can't stand the sight of him this week.  I couldn't sleep last night due to his obnoxious snoring and tossing in the bed.  5:30 AM came, in many ways, not a minute too soon.  I was up and ready for the day, coffee in one hand and a smoke in the other.  He'll go back to work tomorrow night.    The modem... I was on the phone at 9:00 AM with Sprint, trying to track down my modem or at least get a resolution to the problem that I didn't have my modem yet.  3 hours total of hold, 3 dumbasses, 4 supervisors and 1 millimeter of patience left, the tech guy was here to install the modem that I didn't have.  As I let him in, I was still on hold with a Sprint Supervisor that didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.  I explained to the tech guy that I was a hair away from breaking bad on someone and he told me to hang up, let him have the phone and my modem would be here before he could do the wiring for the DSL.  I agreed and it was done.  His supervisor delivered a modem before he could get the wiring done and I was happy, until of course, I opened the box and discovered that the modem didn't use a USB cable but Ethernet instead.  I could have screamed!  The Appointment... Nicholas and I had a "well check" today.  I had to wait in a public waiting area with snotty nosed kids who thought it was funny to draw with their snot on the walls.  I was afraid to touch anything and I didn't dare put Nicholas down.  After a 30 minutes wait, I was finally led into a "Breastfeeding Room."  It was here that I spent the next 30 minutes watching a fucking retarded ass video on "How to feed a baby."  HELLO?!?!?!  I am not a first time mother or an ignorant mother.  I've been there, done that and replaced the carrot stained t-shirt.  I know how, when, where and what to look for when introducing foods.  At least I wasn't in the snot covered waiting area.  Nicholas weighs 14lbs 11oz now, so ya know.  Ethernet Cards... Ok, so the modem is useless without an installed Ethernet card in my PC.  God could my day get any worse?  After our appointment, we came back home to pick Tim and Isaac up but they ended up not going.  Isaac had went to sleep at 4:00 PM.  Holy shit!  If the kid sleeps past 2:00 PM, he doesn't want to go to bed until 11:00 PM and I've been up since 5:30 AM with little to no sleep.  Who do you think is going to sit up with him?  Anyways, so we go to Staples and tolerate the minimum wage stupid fucks and pay way too much for an Ethernet card with a card that probably doesn't have enough in the bank to cover it.  Yay, I get to go to the bank twice this week.  I make it home without running over any grandmothers that really shouldn't be driving because they read the Speed Limit Sign : 22 instead of 55.  I immediately start dinner, it's 5:00 PM now and dinner is at 6:00 PM.  Spaghetti - something not stressful, yeah right.  Tim wants to go ahead and install the Ethernet card to make sure that the DSL works and I try to explain to him that it doesn't matter at this point if it doesn't work because it is now after hours.  He doesn't care and I have to begin installation of this Ethernet card with Nicholas on my titty, food cooking on the stove, Isaac needing help with getting his pants up and Tim up my ass.  It didn't go well.  So I call technical support and select #1 for English and I get some foreigner that doesn't speak English and shame on me but I said, "listen Gook, get me someone that speaks English, NOW."  I know, I know and it is so unlike me.  Needless to say, someone that spoke perfect English couldn't help me so I told them how worthless they were and hung up.  The Modem... Once again, I'm on the phone with Sprint, explaining the problem with the Network Adapter and for once, I get someone that speaks English, knows what he is doing and is obviously trained to handle women that are on the verge of killing someone.  Flawless and in minutes, he gets my network problem solved, my modem installed and me online.  The nighttime thing... Dinner was good but I couldn't enjoy it due to my lovely husband smacking.  I swear he was swallowing it whole.  Sick bastard.  Isaac wouldn't eat because he saw a mushroom in the spaghetti.  Nicholas was an angel but getting exhausted quick and he was on the verge of biting my nipple off.  After dinner, I clear the plates and get the boys in the bath.  Isaac can tell that I'm about to explode and he tried to help me as much as he can but he ended up in the way.  He gets a gold star tomorrow for effort.  Nicholas loved his bath, we were both soaking wet.  Tim is absorbed in his western and offers no help.  Where did my wonderful hubby go?  Now... The kids are in the bed, asleep.  Tim is on the couch, still watching westerns - through his eye lids.  I am so pissed that I can barely smoke without biting the filter off.  This day was an absolute nightmare and I'm so pumped that I couldn't possibly go to sleep.  I can't find other blogs : the happy ones will piss me off more, the pissy ones will set this bitchfest in deeper and the sad ones make me wanna slap the owner and say, "HEY, that's fucking life, deal with it!"  ~~dealing with it (barely)  Ethernet...
