       Hellos... Just hang up with Lian.. heehee.. she sms me&nbsp;@ ard 12:10 to ask if I'm sleeping.. (something she doesn't know about me... )&nbsp; so I called her.. so vick and long if you happen to have long pauses while chatting with me... pardon me....     &nbsp;   btw... yili... thanks la... i know when i sms last wed.. u had your ups & downs too... but like what Brother ryan said in cell today... it's feels really good to turn ard and stll see ur fellow bros and sis around... i turned and saw u and vick... :) i think 3 years from now... we will definitely still be around and definitely another level...&nbsp; I was kinda&nbsp;not too&nbsp;good&nbsp;when still over min stuff when Brother ryan was preaching... hey let me back track..&nbsp;     &nbsp;   actually my day @ work was pretty yucky cuz i was way behind schedule... so ya..with the "break" from min.. and the horrifying national day thingy next week... i'm really stressed...&nbsp; (it was soo last min that I did Chris & jacelyn card ar 5+) and managed to do the songsheet @ 2+...&nbsp; so was kinda worn out by the time I got to Ziv's @ 7.. nope i didn't have dinner... was practising in the room with sis siew choo & brother ryan...and gutiarist&nbsp;long as well...&nbsp;suddenly i feel so "extra" that why am i dOing here... what i lacked... ya.. a douse of self-esteem. .so times it's like i will demean myself.. negative thots... so it's like what my "daughter" Claire &&nbsp;&nbsp;sis&nbsp;Gwen&nbsp;shared with me.. (reinforced by bro ryan) counter them with God's promises...And man.. during p&w.. i felt my hair stood up... (it did not stand up literally) can feel His presence in the room.. then when we prayed in tongues... man... His Presence was sooo strong that all my hair stood up (somewhat like being in a&nbsp; magnetic field...) and even my neck.. i was trying hard not to feel tickled.. and giggle.. cuz.. man.. but it was good.. times of refreshing... :)     &nbsp;   then during the sermon.. bro Ryan shared this... that when God called me... He has already prepared me... i.e.. if i fail to perform/deliver... it's not that I'm not called.. but rather... I neglected what I was to do... cuz i was rather :( due to the break... but... Holy Spirit spoke to me... that I was indeed walking in my calling... just that I slacked and took a detour.... what i yearned for will not happen overnite but... surely it willl....&nbsp; thoughts of dropping choir over cell came to mind.. cuz last week.. i was off.. and with the cell... somehow... I was more happy serving the cell...&nbsp; cuz not doing choir let me interact with the members, talk to the new friends.. to really serve.. I may not know when, how.. but surely, it will be sooon... i need to buck up... and step Up & OUT!     &nbsp;   hee.. i managed to talk to lian..&nbsp; to "psychoed" her to jOin NTU min... (cuz she wasn't that willing.. " heehee&nbsp; PTL...&nbsp; am glas.. that I have the oppty to serve cell again this weekend... but am very :)&nbsp; to see that I've left my mark (hahaha) in vick and lian... cuz sometimes when i give them bs.. I lack the faith to deliver... but all u need is not power sermon.. but a good and open heart... heehee    going o'nite prayer meeting later.. yay!&nbsp; but gving&nbsp;VIcky bs first... am very happy to see pple growing.. : ) i need to too... ttataat!!

I think brother ben like the red color, he saw and was telling the make-up artiste that he was tempted to use that red on one of the BV this weekend.. but dun tink the BV might be willing.. heehee.. it was bright red.. very 30s feel... and I won;t wear it normally...&nbsp;and ivan was&nbsp;of so close proximity with me.. i can smell his hands & breathe,, ehh .. advice to him.. eat mints ( but didn tell&nbsp;him la).. he was pretty yOung and&nbsp;kinda shy.. but got the cool look...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iit was fun.. heehee cuiqi was sitting opp me.. heehee...&nbsp;     &nbsp;  took cab hOme with cuiqi and her friend.. somthink-shan cuz we all are easterners, cuiqi stays @ meville park ( whoops,, wOnder why never bump in to her before..&nbsp; when we were at eugene;s godfather;s), her friend tp..     &nbsp;  reached home.. tired... and ya i still need to birth 2 cards... and i'm very tired..

       man.. today I went to office but I didn't wOrk... It's not that I dOn't want to.. but i was involved in the the ticketing of the national day celebration thingy.. spent morning consolidating orders.. then deposit $ ... tried&nbsp;calling couselee&nbsp;then makan lunch @ food Junction Novena Sq.. hey. the claypot chicken rice not bad .. the rice is actually bUrnt! yumz..     then spent the whole afternoon from 12:50 to 5:30 to "fill 35 branches' order" totalling to 16K .. yah. felt like a production worker... (all by hand.. and gotta re-perforate the sheets cuz sloppy wOrk done by the asst. social sec.. the hon social sec ahh... love the chinese martial arts tai chi... she got great eye poWer! ya.. i 'll stop lamenting.. ) Interesting to learn that my catholic friend's hubby is a free thinker.. she asked me and my friend (both of us are Christians) that CHristians have to marry Christians right (cuz I asked her doesn't her hubby need to be converted as well)... she said she doesn't want to impose her religion onto her hubby.. cuz all religions all meant abt doing good.. so long that the right moral values imparted to her children, she doesn't want to force her children (in future) to be catholics despite she would want to instil the catholic teachings to them.. I was like HUH??? Told her that it's not that we have to marry fellow Christians.. rather.. we believe that we should do so... (the other sister in Christ did not challenge her.. ) I would definitely want my loved ones to have eternal life... man... how can U accept the fact that you're going heaven and hubby going hell.. man... she felt that all religions boil down to the same.. doing good.. manman.. WOrks salvation.. man oh man... Argh.. felt that arguing against that but it ain't doing much good cuz I still need to work with her on the national day tingy &DnD...&nbsp;     &nbsp;   ahh left office @ 2230..haha max called me.. ask me if I'm interested in getting ink pads & stamps&nbsp;(ehh actually i oredi have soMe.. ).. told him nope.. and ..etc.. then finish up my national day tingy packed and left.. man.. Bro Ryan called me 6+ to follow up on Mary.. btw she's my counselee that received salvation last sat.. (man I procrastinated in follow-up..resulting in my last min call this morning.. ) and give her reassurance on salvation.. man.. had the notes oredi.. never got the chance to use it.. except the mock up bs that Brother Andrew made me, rach & raymond to give him last year (b4 the reshufflement) hahaha.. had proceeded long way from there i think... (vick, lian rite?)     &nbsp;   okies.. so i was left with no choice... finally when the train came over the tunnel @ bedok.. (it was already 9.. I called Mary.. was actually praying silently for wisdom to talk to her cuz (a) I didn't get the chance to talk to her after service last sat (b) she is 20 years my senior (c) i really dunnot what to talk to her on (d) i was trully clueless on how to start the cOnversation... man i was nervous when i talked to her, cuz like talking to someone that can be my mom... took me a couple of min to warm up... hmmm the flow got better when the train progressed nearer to home.... Thank You Holy Spirit for annoiting and wisdom to answer her questions.. and when i reached pasir ris..walked home cuz can't talk on bus.. noisy la... man.. I think she was really touched .. heehee.. and asked me where i stayed, when she realised (she stayed at bukit batok) it was that far, told me that if i stayed nearer can come to her place and chat (I was like hahahahha.. not bad la) heehee... i amazed myself... I talke to her for 20 mins!! hahaha...thank You Holy Spirit for Your annoiting!!&nbsp;yay! I'm bAck!    when i was in n181.. i talked to xiao meimei.. now in w110 i talked to aUnty..&nbsp; LessOn learnt: I need to be able to relate to pple of different age grp.. dOn't let my age be the limits... heehee...     tmrw need to go office early cuz i hope myday wont be bUrnt.. need to clear my Workitems by Fri.. and tmrw I'm gOOna be cat's model for the 1930's theme.. she gave me this link   urlLink  http://www.sensibility.com/vintageimages/1930s/images/simplicitybeltdress.jpg   &nbsp;   hahah, how can.. hmmm if it looks good.. I post online hahaha... :P     &nbsp;   tmrw i will call my girls up... and the uncontactables... aHHh.. pHew. me not the main shepherd yet..     &nbsp;

THank U.. emmy.. U're sooo sweet!! :)  let me give thanks to God for giving me the creativity & productivity.. left office @ 530... reached Spotlight @ 550.. man.. still dOn't know how to make the card.. ahh all i have in mind is normal card.. thot of mounting board... can't find in spotlight.. hahha in the end thought of buying paper only then get the board from popular... then i saw the placemat of hardened paper mache material... then saw the heart shape one.. then the idea just came to mind.. hmmm.. then thot of using the cellgrp fotos.. (sad ah.. i sacrificed my 2 cell foto &amp; oso the 2003 emerge fotos.. haha.. gotta reprint...) really love the final product... too bad.. ain't mine...     hmmm somehow it's the feeling... i mean if the inspiration comes..it comes... I have no plan.. ya.that's me... hmmm certain pple would have nicer cards.. I'm not pian xin.. but.. that's the flow .... so can't mass produce or make "mass cards" in advance.. that's why none of my cards are alike (frankly, i dun recall wat I'd done... maybe i should have taken a foto.. heehee)     aniwae.. we got ryan a 2 piece suit from X2... man.. way exceed budget ($200) that munhon gave.. dun disclose price la... but I think he deserves it... :) ard 15 pple turned up.. heeeheee... more bros than sis.. (but that's representative of my cell.. ) but good fellowship... hmmm funny.. just recall the 1st time I joined w110, i jOined them for the monday prayer meeting.. on Aug 18... hahah it's siewchoo's bday ( and i din even know, so no cards. ) we had&nbsp;a mini celebration!! &nbsp;heehee i started the celebrating bday tradition there by cards... hmmm Ryan was rather moved when some of us tOld him of our thots of him... hahha, as usual.. i was silent.. heehee silence speaks a thousand words.. But really I'm indeed very blessed by Brother Ryan... perhaps I'm under him while I was at a more matured stage... (but this one year in w110 was my most eventful year of my almOSt 3 years of Christian Walk... )... aniway, I really learnt lots from him.. and i really wanna thank him for the gentle shakes he gave... (hope there won't be 3rd time... ) and it's a real privillege to serve the cellgrp alongside him... as well as the rest of the helpers...     AS for my the other cgl.. bRother Andrew... he's my inspiration as well... personally, i must really thank him for his painsaking effort for making me to do my QT.. and him being there when i needed help... and he's really annoited.. can't hide much from him... and his pretty wife ..gwen.. heehee... one of the person whom i grew rather close... hahha sOmetimes like to tease me abt her pri sch classmate.. but she sOmeone that I will turn to when i got my pROblems.. veryvery easy to talk to...  hmmmm latelate le.. I gOtta zzzzzzzzzz but pray 1st...     later will be another hectic day for me... gotta go fulfill my duty as a social sub-commer... the coupons sale for our national day celebration.. then afternoon gotta learn the ketchup dance cuz they will do a MV filming for D&D... and ah... D&amp;D.. (fortunately.. i need not perform again for D&D.. cuz in the sub-com.. hOpe Oct no big day.. if not.. ahhh) and on top of that I still have not churn out my letters to Singtel &amp; pwc ahhh.. very technical... and i'm dry on technical knowledge... and my backlogs... ahhh ..things are soooo contradictory.. .the less time you have, the more you need to achieve.... and on top of that.. my&nbsp;spiritual walk recently is kinda spiral... up UP Up.. then down down down.. and Up.. esp last week... but thanks to my dotter to help me see some light... had scribbled this on my blackboard @ work&nbsp;:&nbsp; "A winner is one not one who never fails, but one who never quits" Dr Edward Louis Cole ...&nbsp; many times i wanna give up cuz it's just sooooooo tiring to go on... cuz I'm like the car with flat tyre... & w/o fuel... I need more of Holy Spirit.. more of his power/ strength/ annoiting...       To achieve more with less!   I need to clear 7 cases with 30 workitems by end of this week.. and i can't OT that much cuz mum not happy i not at home... and i've to help cat on wed.. and thurs got cg..and tues 's gone... ahhhh&nbsp; why i agreed to help in the sub-com knowing it's DnD year... ehhh... hmm it's all in His plan..   To achieve more with less!  &nbsp; ooo! I haven't cOntact the new friend that responded to altar call last sat... result of procrastination.. gotta get her by 12nn... I need to priortize!!   To achieve more with less!&nbsp;   ahhh boss just passed me something to read b4 i left with regards to the research i need to do but shelved it for 2 weeks!!

Straight rejection... NOpe.. church is not for me....treated to tang yuan.. hey it's yummy.. i like the peanuts one.. the seaseme one was yummy too.. but the kopitiam very ulu... hoPe to instill more hOpe & jest into her... hmmm she asked me whether wanna go wildwildwet.. told her.. after aug.. hey wonder my cg wanna organise outing there. can get her integrated.. afterall she is of vick, lian, joyce & long's age..   15:30 boarded the Clementi bus.. called lian.. cuz she was late.. I offered to pay cab la.. (cuz her friend almost fly plane).. Praise the LOrd... they were coming down.. man.. sms... vick wondered how to book 40 seats..(cuz she & joyce, the usual seat bookers were bringing their friends) told her that no worries we would settle it.. man..

I managed to find 3 seats on floor (actually it's one whole row with only two sisters by the aisle.. so grabbed the seat... drama was funny... noted that some changes were made... hilarious... (but no drama for s3... ).. was ultra-hyper... (ahh saw msg from siew choo to take counsellor packs..at 645)... hmmm yeeling didnt respond.. :O took yeeling to lvl 4 aft shc.. hotdog was yummy (shared half with lian)..went riveria took ice cream for her.. then walked her to busstop to take bus.. man...

(heehee but he rather new.. and his attitude just remind me of how vick was when she just joined us..he was rather uncomfy abt the size of his cg.. think it's rather large.. but am sure he will move from glory to glory..)  22:10 went back to church.. karen came over to talk to me.. ahh..I didn't know that ziyang, shaoyang & monique are under me permanently... (man!) know that she's not happy that I'm not doing a good follow-up on them.. but her words rather ok.. tone stern....

      哭了。。。泪终于落了。。。 累了。。。最终领悟了。。。  生命的源头并非自己。。。 茫然的靠自己的力量， 所成就的多半不长久。。。  一日间。。。能发生万事。。。 一瞬间。。。你可从雀跃万分的心态 转变到沮丧绝望。。。  就当以为以攀上山顶。。。 但因一时的自满狂妄自大。。。 忘了目的。。。又被绊倒了。。。  自傲终被破碎。。。终于碎了。。。  醒了。。真的醒了。。。 振作了。。。因他扶持了我。。。  因爱。。。所以绊倒了我。。。 不然仍沉迷在这自编的梦境。。。  嗯。。。又回到起点了。。。  嗯。。。不！是半山腰。。。

      hmmm today was more than a blessed day.. rejection again.. never mind I still have one more... straight in the face (ehh no la.. over the fone... hahaha but she has a crush on a Christian friend.. haha she asked me.. can a christian marry a non-christian.. "unequally-yoked" came to mind.. but i can't tell her that right (she's should be U4.. )told her that it's against his/her belief.. should not even began the relationship... haha she was disappointed..hearing that she wanna intro him to me.. hahaa. meeting her next week.. sianz.. was kanna scolded by mum for cooking porridge..   man.. it was only 10:30pm and i'd only just talked to her for less than 5min..)hmmm actually started hounding only at 9:30.. ended 10:30... i think i talked most to lian cuz using hOusephOne..then called simin loh...always kanna persecuted for doing things... but then again.. i supposed I was made the chu qi tong ba.. cuz..dad met with accident this morning.. blocks of bricks fell on him @ the worksite this morning... and he was buried underneath them... Praise the Lord.. his head only sufferd scratches.. but his uppper body & back got lotsa scratches and his right arm & right leg was injured.. all bundled up.. the miraculous thing was that he actually managed to drive himself back from woodlands to home... Praise the Lord for His grace upon my family... I think he's really blessed cuz this is the 2nd time he got into accident.. 1st time, he got minor stroke after jumping down from his lorry..he recovered..not completely but 95%..then now this... but thank God.. I still have the chance to lead him to salvation before it's too late... man oh man...   Ahh.. on a positive note.. I have a good feeling abt nancy.. i almost gave up on her.. hmm she called me again to ask me abt tax matters.. let me try inviting her tmrw (cuz she just came home from hospital & was rather tired..) Yay!! I found the flow again... hahha simin was wondering why i so persistent in inviting her.. i wanna witness but was stopped cuz mom was mumbling at the background.. no choice...   ehhh.. tired.. yay! got chOir prac later... and cellgrp on thurs.. must ask sis siew choo if she needs any help... geee next week got many bday celebrations...  hmmm funny right.. people might be wondering why i still sound so cheery... the joy of the Lord is my strength!! It might seems like an endless chase but... I must press on...    'Therefore do not cast away your confidence,which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise: "For yet a little while,  And He who is coming will come and will not tarry.   Now the just shall live by faith;  But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him." But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but those who believes to the saving of the soul."  ~ Hebrews 10:35 to 39

(hmmm i wonder why? this is the most extreme response..) then she went on to seek other help... the funny idols.. and sigh her life got bad to worse.. hmmmm.. I guessed Holy Spirit prompted me to call her cuz perhaPs the time is rite to call on her again... well.. will try to reach out to her.. perhaps with vivian? :) hmmm perhaps invite her to 15th anniversary if she reject me this week (haven't ask her cuz maomao ran called her out of the blue..& talked to her oni 10min.. contact her again perhaps on wed.. )meanwhile praying for her for healing..   actually wanted to buy an mp3 player.. hmmm out of budget..cuz hahha my bOnus is used up & I'm still short of 1/3 of my mission fund.. God.. I'm sure You will provide!! hmmm bought a tape recorder instead cuz md broke down, and i wanna record choir prac..aniwae.. tape recorder is cheaper.. bought the sony one @ $79..  my blusher had ran out.. so went to espirit to replenish.. hahha people who knows me know i detest make-up.. heehee I guess my cellmembers can see the vast difference liyi in cgm & liyi during svc.. hmm oso bought lipgloss & eyeshadow cuz my fave shade running out.. and i have to use it ah... heehee didn't know that espirit card could be used for red earth products as well.. haha 20% disc.. happy..  I was still carrying the red earth bag in my hand when i board the train bound for pasir ris.. this aunty/lady in her late 30 was looking at me and my red earth bag..~ staring to be exact! (btw I was dressed in tee shirt & jeans cuz today org dressed down cuz there's a sharing session)and i gave her a "YES?? can i help u look?"  and started to tell the guy next to her ( i supposed that should be her brother/friend/relative?) that " next time ah, if you have any girlfriend, better don't find those that spend on make-up... " I was like "what the %#$#$$?" hey.. what's the items that I'd bought has anything to do with U.. moreover.. i did not have a huge bag of comestics and hello! I'm already 20+ (hahha maybe she thot i was still in school.. from the way i dressed) and i bought the make-up cuz I need to make-up for choir.. (need not really make-up for work except big meetings to look professional) and aniwae, to look pro.. ladies do wear make-up.. my-oh-my she must have came from tim-bak-to!  Can't be bothered to heAr what she wanna say (I whipped out my headphones)but she was still glaring at me.. i gave her a dirty look (God i repent) and she was still talking to the male next to her and looking at me.. I took out my mobile.. started to msg "hello.. there's this stupid woman commenting on how much I'd spent on comestics.." and while i was typing this.. she was standing next to me..and i sorta sense she was looking at my fone screen... hahha boy i'm evil but i feel good... hey.. why she picked on me... and i resisted at barking at her.. she was talking so loudly in the mrt.. i chose to ignore by blasting my discman (not really blasting.. just at vol6)  hmmmm i know Holy Spirit wants me to develop the fruit of patience and long-suffering.. lotsa funny peOple came thrOugh my pathways for the past few weeks.. hmmm endure.. ! yay!!

I played with my darling.. haha maybe i should give "him" a name.. haha.. it's brown in color.. hahaha.. brownie.. duh,, hmmm sounds like the eca in primary school.. heehee.. haha.. can't call him scout rite? hahha.. getting colder if i continue in this line of thought... hmmm miss the days of JC.. hahaha never imagine myself to jOin Ventures & Rovers.. (for the uninitiated..it's an scouts group.. hahha I still can remember the first line of the scout motto.. Be prepared!!)but if i didn't.. wOn't befriend ming and heeheee.. won't be in chc? hmmm hard to say.. cUz i saw sOme of my pri sch (Jean.. think she's in S1 but wonder if she remeber me..) and a couple of DHS pple.. think one of them is kelvin..he should be one of the usher IC.. saw a cOuple of guides.. hmmm think one of them is a youth cgl.. (she was in the same SOT batch as jolene..)hmmm think i saw my sec sch classmate zicao on board on chartered bus the other time..? not sure if it was him or not..but it was quite some time back,, and i seems to have lost contact with bulk of the 4C pple... hmmm except for Sandi & Shu'en.. hahha heehee liyun, who was?my classmate for upper sec & same eca in JC)?was the one who invited huiming to chc.. but hmmm she backslided oredi when ming invited me 3 years ago... haha wonder why she never invite me that time leh.. hahha maybe i looked like the not so likely to respond pple.. hahha hmmm me U1 leh... just need pple to invite me hahha....   Opps digress... was kinda late for chinese prac.. reached ard 245..Ops.. phew.. they were just practising open up the gates.. hmmm sang a old worship song.. ehh i hardly recall ever singing it.. but guess that it's an inborne ability to catch the tune or foreguess the tune.. so..got the tune easily and the words ah... ehh.. chorus okie lohz.. hmm give me a couple of weeks can liaos.. went to g4c just now.. hmmmm chinese lyrics sorta direct translation... hmmm really meant a lot when i sang...cuz was practically left with not much when i pledged (hmmm the bonus is now deposited in my acc.. yay!! I can fulfill a huge portion?my pledge!!).. it will be memorial offering to God!..   hmmm last nite msg Sis val that I should be singing for Tues BS (but knowing how much Wed bs need pple, i told sis val that in case tues too many pple.. can put me on wed..) so sis val sms me ard 16:30 to ask me to go wed instead.. so told her okie.. wellwell.. initially thought of going tues cuz wed's my mom's bday..so was praying that mom will be okie if i told her i'd spend the afternoon with her then go church in the evening (me to take half a day on wed lohz...) well amazingly.. when i met her @ whitesands while waiting for dad to fetch us for dinner.. i asked her abt wed..whether she was working.. she told me she would be working half a day and so me told her abt my plan la.. she was cool with it.. Amen!! and the more joyous thing was that... after dinner.. she told me that she will be taking leave this coming sat, sun & mon and she told me that this sunday i go chinese church with you!! Praise the Lord!! I was like.. i don't even need to ask and she wanted to attend the service.... Thank You Holy Spirit for softening her heart and making me a light in the darkness.. cuz sweetie hermione was always the angel shining in the situation.. ( actually dad & mom sorta get into a shouting match again the car?cuz of miscommunication..and dad wanting to catch the 7pm drama on channel U..? but thank God that i said the right things at the right time...)  was watching the NKF fund raising show for the children fund.. hmmmm heart really goes out to these children and their parents.. the question kept repeating in my head... "have they heard about Jesus..have they experience the goodness of God".. I'm not trying to act holy.. but the words they said just expressed their helplessness and hopelessness in their situations.. "What would their life be if they had Christ in their life...would they be feeling the way they do" ~ nope.. "so what are you doing abt it..

      hmmmm just a brief note before i log off.. currently lacking the insipiration to blog... just polish off a bowl of lychees...sweetlike me!!! aM glad that I'd gave all that I could... YAy!! all of my 1/2 month bonus and above... am looking forward to September where i complete the pledge.. truly my dear bank acCOunt @ current state is bleeding really bad...the lowEst ever!!!(it's really veryvery unpleasant to sight...)but despite that am believing that I can fulfill it... hmmm am now resorting to keep all the plastic card at home (except my identity card, my warrant pass, my staff pass & ezlink... yups.. leave all cards behind so i can stick to my budget..) haha not living in a poVerty-mindset.. definitely gave wHAt Holy Spirit prompted me... thoUgh i very muchie wanted to save this $$ for either SOT or mission trips.. bUt.. hmmm am giving it to the fund 1st.. (btw my bonus only accounts for 2/3 of my pledge and I'm still paying my dear ntu loan.. bUt God is my Jehova Jireh.. so I believed that THis can be done... )  God is a God who hears and answers prayers.. two years ago.. I used to even have difficulty finding a place to do my QT...so skipped at times... bad example...(was sharing room with my mum.. was staying at a 3room flat.. brother got his own room.. dad took the living room at nite.. why ah? long story lah...but now not the case oredi la...) hmmm i was desperate to the point that i prayed in the tiolet.. needless to say.. my best QT was when the whole household is out and i can sing all i can.. hence i always love walking from bedok interchange to home... (abt 10 - 15 min) cuz.. hahaha i will be singing to Him.. conversing to the Holy Spirit aloud.. (haha i still do now.. so i love walking home.. ) and always almost kanna questioned by Brother Andrew Wai abt my spiritual life... particularly QT... (hated it when he aasked me that when we shared cab home after cg @ estella's.. cuz didn't do mah.. hahaha)  so asked God for breakthrough in my spiritual dryness... and a room to myself so that I can seek Him... :)heehee.. and Praise the Lord! Family decided to shift.. to my cuRrent place adjacent to Downtown east.. and me need to pay a cent.. (my brother co-owner with dad) (side track.. ahhaah 2nd stupid msg from guys wanting to chat.. ) so my blessing not monetary in return la.. hahaha but i dun mind... cuz 2003 was the year of growth from the gal who eats from the spoon and needs a shoving in the back from dear ivory... & brother Andrew..  hmmm not that I'm complaining abt not being able to spend my bonus... in fact.. i'd been giving my bonuses to building fund and now the mission fund.. (haha when my collegues ask me when i was going to hols.. and i definitely had lotsa $$ hahha.. yups in God's storehouse..)and yups... but God is good... I guessed i was pretty blessed.. despite i din get $$.. my desktop, my MD player (sad.. retired now..), my hi-fi set.. my TV.. and my T610 was sponsored by mum .. (wat i gave for my 2 building funds.. i sure had reaped more.. )  had always been a spendthrift.. since sec... haha used to spend $40+ monthly on CDs & singles. (hahaha i think i should have spend at least a thousand on CDs & mags like tOPS.. smashhits..big.. seventeen.. her world..cleo.. elle (not the local edition) (haha i was a groUpie...I simply adore bsb.. and i have 4 versions of the CD single of I'll never break your heart..)Ops..hahah mei xing xiang le..   started work.. splurge on bags (think that I got one of my side cabinet filled).. clothes (hmmm not veryvery x la.. but think most X was this british india skirt that cost $108.. )...shoes.. now i shou lian le.. boh bian la.. cannot lead this kind of hahha waste $$ lifestlye.. but then i never fail to tithe la.. am :) that I tithed the very month i was saved... heehee and to my 1st building fund two months later... hmmm cuz i believe that whatever we have is not ours... hmmm if we can trust Jesus for our salvation.. why can't we trust Him for the 10% that was in fact the full 100% from God...   hmmm think i need to take up tuition... :) cuz i wanna go Israel next year...hmmmm and guangxi too.. :)  hahaha i'm a natural long-winded gal... This is not a short-update.. i guessed u just gimme any topic.. i can just blabber & blabber...  but truly.. am really :) that I gave all that I could to the point I can sing mariah's my all (hmmm perhaps parts of the lyrics not suitable?/ ha change the sub will do the job.. ;p) and cuz I know He will make my desires and dream come thru'!!   Ohh btw the song in background.. i love this song.. It's Sammi's 我們的主題曲.. i like sammi.. hmmm eversince Feel 100%.. hmmm i'm not cantonese but haha that;s abt the dialect I'm semi-fluent...(not bad la.. the time i went HK.. natives shocked that Singaporean can speak cantonese..they thought only M'sian can...) hahaha i'm very aunty in sense that I love watching TVB's drama... still adore 妙 手 仁 心 I & II (canto version)... and 談 判 專 家 (hmmm especially like this series cuz chilam is soooo cool... ) remember that I watched the whole series in record time.. the moment that my bro took home the VCD.. i finished it that nite.. (the discs came in portion..cuz the show just arrived in S'pore.. think not for rental yet..)okie...i  better stop.. i can go on yakking.. ooohhh btw i should be working today (at least half a day) but was talking too late to yili.. hmm not yili's fault.. i then read read my bible.. then hahha fell zzzzzzzzzz... and woke ard 6 to off my nite light..then at 10... geee to late to work..so i take urgent leave ba.. and prepare my bs and for my guitar lesson... hmmm speaking of which let me go play with him... let me try to add music to my worship.. had been singing accapella for past 2 years.. :) time flies..  gonna be 3 years @ CHC... came @ 12th ani. sat beside monique & meiwen.. hahah now in same cell as monique again.. ;p  the long-winded gal..going to play with her hubby...

      let me see.. time is now 3 a.m..  did a lot of things today.. Once again.. i slept with the TV on again... fell zzzzzz after watching the euro finals half way when the score is still o-o.. bOrin...  didn't blog on sundae cuz got hOme rather late..then stArted chatting with vicks...let me see what happened on sunday...  went gym in the am.. hahha was sUrprised that my pt (i won't have the luxury of this soon...gotta skim my spending habits) actually confided in me.. ehh he was stUck in a situation.. wanna seek my opinion (btw he's a free thinker.. )(actually heard the Inner Voice.. saying.. reach out to him, i was like.. huh... okies.. ) then he popped the question.. what would you do if you were me.. somehow.. i just blurt out.. I would pray.. if i'd the peace.. then i'll proceed with the decision.. (cuz he was actually @ the crossroad of his career..)was kinda sUrprise that I actually managed to sow sOme sense into him.. seems that he was escaping.. so hahha.. told him that if we don't face up to reality &  solve the prob.. , you will always end up facing the same problem again.. like ta-baoing tests..  In a way, i know that I myself gotta face whatever I'm facing...running away will just loop me back to the starting point...   sang for chinsese afterward.. learn 2 new sources.. my source & opne up the gates...  hmmm.. went dinner with my dad & mom.. dunno who mentioned Blk 88 bak chok mee earlier that week.. suddenly thot of eating that.. :) so we went.. :) then went grocery shopping with mom & dad at the cheapo stall near my previoUs area.. bedok nth.. ehh.. haven't spend much quality time with parents for long.. Peace.. never take this for granted... came a looong way and hard way to appreciate that.. am ever so thankful that He always come thru' for me at that moment..am believeing that at least 50% of my household will be on fire for GOd by year end... :)   ehhh song:"that's what friends are for" is on air (am listening to class)am really blessed.. :)with friends at wOrk (unsaved yet.. but will soon be.. )cOme to think of it.. friends that know me lOtsa aRE thOse who I'd Some sort of MisUndersTanding with.. my longest-friend sandi..

Ops!! was in the same class from sec 1 to 4.. and we had a COLD war from Aug 94 till Dec 94.. And it was really freezing cold war.. sub-zero temp.. but God is good... She invited me to X'mas mass @ a church in kembangan (so adpt.. a song that reminds me of my sec sch years just came on air.. sometimes love just ain't enough)and yups.. it really awkward (btw we're in the same eca too.. yeah.. Choir)cuz we had not been speaking to each other for half a year.. well...somehow.. we just hugged and reconciled... ya.. she tried to jio me to church but i was just plain lazy to go sunday svc consistently cuz i think blossom was showing 130@ channel 5..

I guessed cuz I dUnno what was going On.. and she'd proMised me not to divulge..but..

AAAHHHH I'm late big time!!!  jUmped out of bed, grab my clOthes and slappped some make-up on my face and geeee realised that I had only $16 left.. ahhh it will cost at least $20+ to get to chURch.. ah,,, just did half of my face and flew out of the hOuse.. time is 18:05... reached downtown east at 18:10 ah.. the atm machIne was Down.. ahh..  no Choice.. flew to the busstop & flagged a cab..

The words of Holy sPirit was mUch clearer.. and half way when Pst Kong was preaching.. man.. I could really sense His presence.. . bUrden for the lost really weighs on me.. Ultimate pUrpose of a Christian.. find mOre empty vessel to fill... and in tUrn fill more...   Holy Spirit was telling me that.. ger.. where's your empty vessels?? tRue..

      am having suCh jOy... remnant of what I'd went thRu' dUring prayer meeting few hOurs ago...   thank God that I was able to make it...oNi told my mUm @1745...   saNg for sErvice One.. PrAise the Lord for divine hEaling.. my calf muscles weRe kindA over-stretched (I gUessed it was dUe to me ovEr-hYper on tueS.. (was actually haVing tRouBle climbing dOwn staiRs..for a cOuple of days.. ) if not... can't be a "jUmping jack" last nite...   OvernIte prAyer meeting was aweSome... nevEr sTayed thRoughOut the fUll session... until last nite.. and bReakThru was that theRe are more than the usUal faCes i see... Six HouRs..  :) fiNally rEceive cOnfiRmaTion to over ceRtain arEas of my life thAt's like so mind blOggering and rather difficult to tRust in Him... And the other vOice in my head trying to sOw thOughts of dOubt & deFeat in me... sAw thaT i was oNe of the sand pArticle that He picked up.. (ya.. that's hOw small i thouGht i was... small and insignificant.. inSecUre...) despite of how i depict myself to be... I was who God has creAted... maNy a times.. I dOubted whether cerTain things are frOm Him...I was faithless BUt He saw what was in me...   saw that I was in this hOle of daRkness where I was leading mysELf into... A hand that strEtches in and pull me Out...   acTually was On the vErge losing my vOice whiLe praying in pairs.. sOrry long... I know I sound like a frOg.. my thRoat was simply toooo dry... (from the kopis that I'd) and thROat was constricting... and Jaws wEre aching... yah.. i was shOuting.. badbad for my vocal cords.. bUt i regained my vOice back after the breaK..  LASt paRt of the Prayer meeting was ... wOrds can't expREss whAt i felt... we're just taking time to meet Father God and to wOrship Him...saw myself singing to Father God up in the heavenlies....Just to Him alone...He never left me.. I was drying Up cUz I was shUtting Him Out...His presence in the Auditorium was soooo thick... we cOuld just continue to wOrship on & on...  Members who were in church before 2000 was laid hands on... Many received the Holy Laughter... Pastor Ming came over to lay hands on us.. DEspite that pastor was at the other end, the moment that Pastor lay hands on Max... I saw light.. then.. i was DOwn... (later I realised i caused a domino effect.. cuz i pulled emmy down... poor Chris was trying hard to sUpport us...) i just feel that the oppression was lifted... Liberated..   was still lingering in His presence when i was off the mrt.. so i took a detOur in the Pasir Ris Park..  actually dOzed off when i got hOme and stArted to finish mo niu de taio jian.. (finally i did).. Gwen called me @11 cuz she wanna loan formal dress from me.. (but i do not have la except my prom dress hahaha.. i think tooo long for her oso...) Suddenly just knew that I need to seek Him.. started singing and just went on & on... and saw this: the back view of a man & a little girl... Yup.. that's me & my Father...He was holding my hand.. walking with me... I was this little girl with two pony tails..  He is always there in all my situations..He never let me go of His sight.. yes.. i was already His before i heArd His name.. (realised that i was actually rather envious of my friends duRing my primary School days that they attend sUnday school... now I know why... I was not a mistake... i'd was handpicked...)  never will i wanna lose touch again... Lord I TruSt in You...Visions you given me... yes..they have not come to pass yet..but it will.. it's not my timing.. it Yours! And yes.. I know what He wants me to do next year... it's getting clearer & clearer.. Obedience is better than sacrifice!  verse of the day: "Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and mulitply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everyting for all liberality which causes thanksgiving through us to God" ~~2 Cor 9:10-11.  P.s. another friend decided to blog.. :)

          Hmmm I haven't been online for days..was rather tired and realized that I was easily irritable cuz.. hmm cuz the cycle goes again...(din have any major outburst...but was tested by two incredible sisters..?one from POM/ one from my cell...     hmmm many thoughts flowed thrU my mind for the past few days...but more or less.. they revolved around the same topic...well.. I shall attempt to summarize...      for the past few months...I've been thru...some of the most turbulent times of my spiritual walk.. though the deep valley age might not been long...it did made deep impact...ya.. the plunge was rather deep..every time I edged towards some sort of victory, my complacency would result the slip to be even deeper.. well.. to the extent that I would have lost 2 of my very good friends cuz of my 'not-very-discerning-antenna'... and as a result given some mixed signals but glad that al's histOry now and that friendship with them have gone stronger...        During these 3 weeks break from choir...I realized that :  (a) I really missed serving in choir... (b) I didn't get into this ministry by mistake.. I'm not void of talents to serve in this ministry... singing in parts and harmony not a difficult feat to me.. (though i'll prefer if beansprouts are given...) (c) I can bring friends even if I'm involved in the production...(used to use serving as an excuse to not bringing friends...bad ah...certainly!! it's all in the mind... ) but glad that I'd a breakthrough of the drought since eh...X'mas 03...oh...nope...did brought mOm to service sometime this year...but ya.. c'est tout! hmmm ya...violet came for service 7 last week! yay!! hmmmm she didn't respond to the altar call...at least I can upgrade her from U4 to U3... she just find Pst Kong's sermon very inspiring ...but she see that religion ain't a priority for her yet...hmmmm I'll continue to work on her... preserve! (incidentally, that's part of the school motto for my primary school.. sincerity and perseverance)  was burnt out by the POM.. yah, I know that all i did was the cheerleading...but as a result of the 'heartbeat' move... think I stomped my right feet too hard...(hmmmm my right ankle kinda hurting...my old injury...) can't wear heels now...  after service 7's Pom.. went cafe.... heehee saw mei.. my youngest daughter (haha.. sijia was shocked to learn that I'm her mum!! heehee.. ) took a neo-print with her...J then ate with alvina...hmmm she said that he's 蛮帅的.. (haha... guess who is he??)  Watched fireworks at marina with mOm.. glad I did that.. (though the fireworks were not bad...but glad that I managed to pacify her bitsy by spending time with her..)    I,Robot     Took the day off on Monday...( partly to recuperate & partly of my cramps.. ) Went PS to catch I,Robot... before that I went to buy my medicine at bedok nth...then went Ps...I was like...so glad to be free..from work...I-Robot was great.. (notwithstanding that the male lead was Will Smith...yups...he's one of the actors that I'd like since young...heehee.. since fresh prince of bel-air..) well.. as the movie progressed...the question that the robot (which I recalled was named sonny by the creator, which he fondly named as my father) 'What am I created for?' plagued my mind... hmmmm prior before to hermione's dark ages, I'd been plagued by this question...which was what led me to buying "A purpose driven life"... but still due to the dark ages...I'd lost focus...lost direction.. and most importantly.. forgotten the ultimate fact.. I was created uniquely..by my Heavenly Father even before my birth...Was brought to mind of the bare fact that everyone was created by God for a reason at the scene where by Sonny was being examined by susan- a post mortem... and that he was told that he was different from other NS-5, eg.. his composite was stronger...than others...(sonny was built for a purpose..but he was unaware of his purpose.. He has many secrets hidden in him.. like his composite...he only realised his ultimate purpose towards the end of the movie...) and once again... whereby he related his dream to susan and spooner... that "I believe my father has made me for a purpose...We all have a purpose"... Everyone will be used by God.. to serve God in the way in his unique manner... each of us has a purpose in life! and ya.. I was immensely touched by Holy Spirit especially towards the end of the show...heehee...haven't teared in movie for a long time... Cuz...I felt the Holy Spirit reassuring me.. that I will reach that dream that He has placed in me...I may not see it happening...but it will.. in due time... The last scene of the moive.. I depicted myself to be sonny...standing on top of the hill... and... :P      "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable." Rom11:29       lian called me (for once she called me.. heehee.. ) she sounded rather excited abt her soccer.. yeah.. her 1st session in female soccer... hmmm spent 40+ minutes loitering at my voiddeck.. ya! cuz not convenient for me to call at home... ya.. PO... even though it's my own hp... hmmm glad to see her breaking thru' in some areas... :) Jia you! sister!!! told her that if she has probe with her maths.. can come find me... (haha... that's used to be my stronghold... ya. my strength is mathematics... if only I'd been more diligent in my F.maths... hahaha.. then I'll have 3 As... but I'm contented with my B... heehee.. cuz it was an "E" in my prelim! haha!! btw my grades in As really a miracle... cuz it was a COEE to AABC... ( in this order) heehee... :)     okie... gotta zzzzzz.. may sing soon.. yay!! :) break might be over sooon.... :) sis val just sms me.... :)

      Amen!! despite after the last run of the pom at 730.. that we still not sure of wat to be done.. amen! turned out great! Atmosphere was good... btw we did the TRP cheer for POS (cuz bulk of them from TP... and the overall i/c brother melvin as well...)  One thing I learnt from brother melvin.. he sees the good side of everyone.. slow to reproach, quick to praise... to boost our confidence cuz we were like kinda discouraged that we can't get the steps right... revelation:  you need not harp on what went wrong to get things right... treat pple lovingly... the greatest of these is love... 1 Cor 13:13  love changes changes everything... (one line out of the odie that i like...  love changes everything... )  gotta zzzzzzzzzz... meeting 12:30 at church... stunts pple even earlier... :)

          hmmm I have not blogged for days… Many things have occurred… good and bad.. happy and sad… encouraging and frustrating… being a long-winded person by nature, I would try to keep this entry as short as possible… (heehee… my dear pals would know that I’m rather lengthy when it comes to writing…)      Okie… Saturday… Service day… I think I did blogged… hmmm sermon message very applicable…      Sunday      Had a good day at service 3 choir outing.. not many turned up as the one at marina bay… hmmm got to know some more pple… (seems that most of the youngsters didn’t come, except Peiyu…) hmmmm… I didn’t know that my presence significant… Peiyu was asking me when my break will be over… it seems different without me.. heehee… dear girl… soon la.. I hope…. yay… my group came in tops… heeh  ee.. got a bookmark for prize.. that’s so adapt to me currently…    “Some people see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not. What your mind can conceive and believe. It can achieve.”       The games ended 12++ … we went to lagoon food center to makan… hmmm ate my fave duck porridge.. (have not ate it for apprx 1 year cuz the food center undergone renovation…) hmmm after lunch went causeway point with sis Jocelyn, Jo & Cat…    J    hmmm cat had a good time at the array of cosmetic at the JL there…    J    sis Jocelyn always on phone… looking for pple for the parade of ministry… sigh.. I won’t be able to help despite I should be able to go all 7 services… cuz still break mah… hmmm some were rejected cuz of their countenance not good… man.. heng.. I don’t fall into that category… hmmm nevertheless… there will always be next year!    J      left causeway point ard 5:15..   took 969 to tampines.. heehee.. it was fast… reached tampines in less than 50min! hmm went to a D.Y.I. Shop to get my shower head (ya, it went on strike on sat… hmmm to prevent my mom from nagging.. decided to fix it myself!) It’s very easy to replace.. unscrewed the old one.. and screwed on the new!!    J    hmmm wat else did I do? can’t recall… slept very early… ard 11… and woke up 10+ on Monday!      Monday ~ August 9.. Yay! Happy 39 th  Birthday Singapore!!       Had a good QT! was reading Roms.. then was x-reference to Hab… Hab2:2-3  "Then the Lord answered me and said: "Write the vision And make it plain on tablets, That he may run who reads it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time; But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; Because it will surely come, It will not tarry"    Amen! Despite that the vision He has given me has not come to pass... it doesn't mean it's not real.. just that the time ain't ripe! Gotta wait....      met simin @ 5:30+ hmmm had a quick dinner at moss (which was good cuz the money bag kinda empty….and my phonebill for August (combined) is just a few dollars short of $200!!) she lamented abt the unmarried colleague who’s kinda good catch but als.. a Christian, so impossible (I broke the news that usually believers will & should date believers).. hmmm she tried to intro me to her “short, fat, ugly” colleague to me… haha cuz he too was a Christian.. man… hmmm he’s two years our senior. also from hwa chong… Ek… haha… I know who I fancy and He knows when he’ll come…    J      saw mei, my colleague, @ Isetan Orchard, with her sisters..    J    hmmmm we jalan-jalan a bitsy at taka… then went to far east… simin was complaining abt her doctors colleagues didn’t want to gop far east.. cuz very lian & cheapo… (eh…. hmmmm)      Well.. I bought a pair of ballerina pumps at 29.90.. very sweet… it’s white with rainbow stripes across.. (haha… cannot buy pink stuff anymore.. I got a lot of pink stuff recently…) man this is the story of sowing and reaping… I elaborate later… saw Adrian when we were abt to leave far east.. (cuz 50% of the shops had pulled the shutters…by then.. ard 9pm)     tried to invite simin.. but she's on call this weekend... (meaning she's gotta work round the clock! btw she's a doc, currently working at imh...) hmmm... to make myself happy... i went to Mango.. bought myself a sweet baby pink turtle neck.. (ya.. I know it's pink!)   not that ex-just 35... :) but i guess that will be the only item for the month...      Tuesday: Today!!      hectic day at work... (hmmm i can be pretty nasty to nasty pple... not my colleagues..but the TPs... hmmm) hmmm invited Cherie.. she has yet declined... gotta pray that the chalet she's going will be a drag and she will go service on sun! (she sounds rather keen when i gave her the invitation! )     yay! Yeeling (lian's friend) coming to cg on thurs!! :) just spoke to her for 50 min.. (feel bad.. i called her hp... she's at hall... ) hmmm wonder why eugene and joyce said that I'm too busy to give her bs... Hey.. i enjoy giving my gals bs.. I get to know them better, and they get to know me better!! :) (that's how I got to know Vick & lian a whole lot better!! ) maybe that's why i dunno joyce that well... never gave her bs... giving BS is not merely acting as an information provider.. it's impartation of knowledge.. and for me , I never fail to learn something new each time i give my gals bs... :) (yay! Lian just sms me.. huiling coming for cellgrp this thurs.. we were just talkin abt her.. nah, not ms banana.. :p)     In short… am glad that I had not been living on stale manna for the past few days… bread must be fresh!! hahaha… brought to mind how my dear pal violet and I coded the JCs via their uniform… let me see if I still recall?     here it goes:     * TJC= Tree/ mushroom (their badge VJC= butter NJC= Stone HCJC= bread NYJC= burnt bread! CJC= SBS bus driver (males) & factory workers (females) TPJC = Nurses AJC = blueberry ACJC= hmmm this one we didn’t name but we like the uniform the best!.. eh the other JCs,,, hmmm can’t remember the rest….     ps sorry if u feel insulted.. heehee... i was rather notty then.. but violet and i pride ourself to be bread!!      talking abt Pink... hmmm in uni.. there was this gal that we like to label her as pink friend.. cuz of her penchant for pink.. man... little do i realise that recently.. esp 2004... i had became a Pink friend.. heehee... vicky commented that i like to look at pink stuff... and so did simin... heehee... confession.. ya... :) maybe its a PINK year for me... heehee... :) but please dun call me pink friend ya?      yay! my left fingers went a-peeling-again!!

I was found again...  Pastor Kong asked who were sick to respond after the sermon.. wellwell... I was having this cough.. since monday.. kinda phelgmy.. but i felt much better after PnW.. then...Pst Kong asked members to lay hands on those who were sick... hmm Ivory prayed for me.. :) (Thanks Ivory!  and Tracy... thanks Tracy!! see ya at eastcoast later... ) and truly.. the phelgm was like GONe.. after that...

(2100 of them).. printing.. cutting.. perforating.. and sorting... then the letterings for the stage.. and I still need to cough up my cases to boss tmrw.. and I'm on FULL DAY course tmw (wed) ... man.. i'd a very scumptious dinner... think i only have the opportunity to eat a good dinner once a week.. i like the soup that my mom made... like what they says, Cantonese are expert in double*boiled soup! :)    hmmmm got a shock when i checked my email..saw a friendster message from a mattew?? man.. I'd no connection with him at all.. he's a friend of my choir friend.. and this man is like 38!! hmmm ?? so told him that sorry to decline his request and that I was not in the "looking for partner stage".. ( I was rather stOned.. cAn't think of the words to tell him that I'm not interested.. he ain't my type... ) oo... I was chatting with max online then.. so i told him this la.. and I was bewildered at his reply...  i was totally confused so..bo chup... anyway.. continued the chat with him.. ard 1.. when my dotter logged off.. my dotter blogged too.. the middle one... :) man... ended up that haha.. I got myself a mummy.. (he's trying to freak me out so.. he will go with any title... ! hahaa!! )     RAchel.. thanks for ur sms... hmmmm very extremely busy so i didn't reply...  revelation? I was reading the book of Ecclesiastes... Ecc7:8 to 9 "The end of a thing is better than its beginning; the patient in spirit is better than the proud in the spirit. Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in bosom of fools.." I was encouraged... that despite of my tumblies.. my backwoods manner... how i started. ain't that crucial.. cuz it's how i end the race... do i give up halfway and throw the baton on the ground... Nope... I'm must be patient and endure... gettin out of the tunnel... ! man.. it's getting more an more exciting every year! This year is the most eventful by far!!  yay!

       Hmmm I was too tired on Sunday to blog...   hmmm reached home around 9:45 pm...gee, I was out for more than half a day...   let me recall the events...(it was sure an eventful day) woke up at 08:30.. very tired.. went back zzz...Gee...9am.. late! sms lian.. told her I'd not meet her at bedok...9:15am left house...reached church at 1050? long arrived ard same time.. Eugene was already there waiting for Qingyun (what a sweet sounding name ah? My impression of this person should be someone of a sweet composure.. demure?man I was wrong! )    Meanwhile.. Eugene was telling me how fitting?the shirt the cell-group got for him was.. Vicky, we under-estimated his chest size! haha!    QY arrived at 11:05...(Fortunately, I've got lian to book seat for us?) hall only opened around 11:20.. well.. between that, tried to make small talk with her.. Real conversation with her was not easy cuz she has ATTITUDE! Heeehee?saw bimei @ staircase.. haven't seen her for sucha long time.. (ooo?mei is my youngest dotter)? I missed her? guessed that it not the length of time we know each other but.. the chemistry we have? :) okie.. in B4.. man.. QY just sank into her seat and played with her 8250...hmmmm tried to talk to her but to no avail.. long and I tried to get her to stand during p&w but she refused...wellwell.. lian came over and asked if she could get her to stand up for p&amp;w.. Lian asked her "do you mind if you stand up ~ as a sign of respect?? guess what's her reply YES, I mind!"" Ohmigosh! After p&w, she asked if she could leave now...Eugene asked her to stay a little longer ...but she left after we stood up to pray for the mission team.. MAN! (If she stayed, am positive that many demons would get delivered!) wellwell.. Eugene was rather disappointed that she left even before the preaching of the word...    Hmmm atmosphere of service 5 was rather ok..compared to service 3..but I perceived more..cuz.. hahah..the condition of my heart.. hmmm the matter of truth was that I don't even feel like to open my mouth on sat nite...(yah, I got a very bad countenance.. I faked my smiles.. Ops.. but.. Sunday was different... heeheehee.. it's really a release and relief and free)  Saw jason &amp; linda & son after service... man they have all grown in sizes... Jason look sooo rOund!! think he's attending service 6.. hmmm made some small talk with them.. :)  makan lunch at kopitiam with long and lian...hmmmm one kid approached long to buy lucky no. from him (he looked rather pitiful..and gestured that he didn't have $$ for food.. ) kind-hearted long asked if I'd change.. in all.. we gave him $3.. heehee.. not sure if the no came up in the 4d last nite.. think it was 1490? hahaha  after lunch.. went with lian to her hall...hmm on way to bus-stop...saw my darling dotter from afar outside church...man.. I was just telling lian that I saw my dotter with her friends when she shouted MOMMY!?~ not once.. twice! heeheee? so cute.. she got a cutsy voice.. hahaha just like me!! hahaha talked about sowing and reaping?I became lian's "Maria"for the day? heeheehee...and I was wearing a skirt...room was rather dirty..perhaps her side of the room was not occupied for sometime...and the blinds were sticky to touch!! started off by praying for the room and her roommate (by her timetable, conclude that mostly like she's a third year eng student?) Was rather inspired by the cleaning-process...should clean up my room also.. The brand of detergent we concluded to be very effective in cleaning up the blinds.. Dynamo! (we 'bOrrowed" from her roommate cuz she forgot to bring hers.. ) then it started pouring at ard 6+...hmmm we finally completed the cleaning process around 8pm+ and it was still pouring...Thank God for sheltered walkway.. went to hall 4 bus-stop to take 179 out..  Man..was rather tired by the time I got home.. fell asleep on the couch while watching some info-ed program...dragged myself to room and plonked onto bed at 11:15... man...at 12:05 my fone rang...it was the same no. that called me last nite when I was fellowshipping with cellgrp.. I guessed getting long to tell him its the wrong no. was not effective enough.. if he called again..I'm gonna tell him to stop calling or else I will file a report to the authorities..  Got an irritating call from barley. her name sounds like barley...got barked by the wild barley for no reason... and some very inquisitive staff to enquire about the D&amp;D .. (cuz I just sent out the 3rd teaser to staff...ahh.. am not in the mood to entertain cuz my throat rather itchy...maybe cuz I shared the green tea with lian yesterday? cuz lian got cough?or maybe it's the rain? )  later gotta meet violet.. don't really feel like meeting anyone.. cuz I got chunks of work to do.. but gotta meet her...cuz I really wanna invite her to church? hopefully for the 15th anniversary?Not sure by then would I come out of retirement mode?I hope so?  10:30 pm.. (monday) reached home.. hmmm din exactly invite violet but..at least.. gOt in touch with her again.. (she rejected me straight in face last week... let me give her some breathing space 1st! she's a U3.5 to U4) went shoppng with her... hmmm saw this light pink corduroy @ mango... hmmm wanted to buy but...hmmm out of budget... :( still short short of my mission pledge...) guess that I'd changed quite a bitsy.. used to be very super materialistic.. hmm my dear friend was like trying to find the perfect bag (note: must be designer-brand).. i was like...if i were u.. let me give unto mission... ( i used to be a sucker 4 brands... remembered that the 1st item i bought with my part-time pay from POSB after JC was a JPG long wallet (hahaha.. and all my pay from working 2 weks in december went into it... !! )  hmm now gotta go shower and start cutting alpahabet for the national day celebration... man this gonna be a superbusy week... am on course tmrw and wed.. and I gotta print another 2000 coupons (serially-generated by hand &amp; excel...) and to proferate by hand....) ..... and my cases... ahhhhaaaaaaa!! think i might have to work this stt morning again!! :)  I hope i'm not on ministry "sabbath" for long... dun think soooo.... aniwae... ja ne!
