      I am a music snob.  The music that I listen to and "discover" is SOOO much better than any other music on the planet.    Now that that's taken care of :), this next link should show you some of the crap that caused me to quit listening to the radio:  urlLink By clicking this link you agree that Nickelback is the worst band ever.     Please listen to it, as this "musical incest sounds better than anything Nickelback will ever actually write." -Nintendorks

      Coworker making me very angry right now...being stupid and making it out to be my fault...  Let me ask you this: If someone calls your office with a matter that needs immediate attention (and that you can fix quickly), do you fix the problem immediately or do you inform your coworker that there is a problem and that you are going to fix it?  My preference is to fix the problem so that when you DO tell coworker(s) about it, not only are you informing of a problem, but you're informing them that there's already a solution in place. For example, what sentence would you rather hear? "AAAAAAAHHHHHHH, THE BUILDING'S ON FIRE!!!!" or "AAAAAAAHHHHHHH, THE BUILDING'S ON FIRE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CALLED...PLEASE FOLLOW ME TO THE STAIRWELL!!!!"  You decide.  OH, by the way, the coworker wanted me to tell them about the problem because they "didn't know what was going on and didn't want to sound dumb on the phone." Shoot me, please.

      It was rather choppy, not the best motion picture quality.  Too bad, too, for those Panasonic screens are pretty sweet!  I think the crappy video quality has something to do with the teleconference stiff that we have to blow the signal through on its way to the monitor...it's not just a straight RGB from notebook to monitor.  Phooey, there goes my idea of a HUUUGE PC monitor on the weekends for EQ, hahaha!

      I'm in the executive conference room right now, testing the resolution of one of our spiffy new plasma screens. I like what the teleconference images look like, but we've yet to hook up a PC to the other display (hahah, we have twin 42" plasmas on the wall in here, pretty swanky if you ask me). As far as I know, this is the first time this has been done.    In order to test the image quality with moving RGB images, I have decided to show BMWFilms' series...hope it turns out okay!

      When I started this blog, I wasn't altogether sure of how much time would need to be spent on it. I'm now in that stage of "new thing" where my energy to continue it is waning, and I'm finding other things that need my time in a more pressing way.    Josh's computer is officially back to life. I brought it home to my workshop last night, and spent some much-needed time with it. I don't know what sort of virus that poor guy had in there, but it's gone now. I think he's the only person with a Compaq from 1998 that has Windows XP Pro, hehee. Quite the upgrade from Win98SE, dont'cha think?    I also set him up with FireFox and ZoneAlarm, as well as a free antivirus program whose name escapes me at the moment. He won't know how to run the antivirus, but he'll learn :)    Oh, and if you're ever in a hurry to lose $400, take your car to Midas. I got kicked square in the pants last night when getting a new exhaust for one of our "fleet" just because Ford decided to put this crappy braided steel section in their exhaust. I left the parking lot with a quiet vehicle once again, but feeling rather used. Wait until their computer breaks, then I'll be the one using MY knowledge to take THEIR paychecks away!! All your computers are belong to us.    Question: Do you ever feel like your lack of knowledge/training in a certain area puts you at a severe disadvantage? For example, my lack of knowledge about automotives made it impossible for me to know whether or not I was being hosed. What did you do about this?

      I have just been reminded as to why I like naps so much...slept for three hours or so.&nbsp; The amount of coffee that I drink during the week makes my weekends without coffee very logy.

      This completes the circle, I have now blogged from every computer I have access to.  Rejoice.     I'm hungry, but not the sort of hungry that you can eat on, you know?  It's the empty pit feeling that's almost painful, but also rather close to the nausea end of the spectrum.  I suppose I COULD eat, would give me a chance not to do some housework :)

      So I'm laying in bed, it's 10:30 AM here, and my mouth tastes as if some small creature of the night crawled in there and used it as a latrine.  Yes, I drank one 40-ounce too many last evening.  Ow, my head...it hurts to clear my throat for some reason.     The funny part is that I am so comfortable, I can't even bring myself to turn the channel from "Book TV" on C-SPAN2.  Bernard Lewis (who holds something like 105 honorary doctorates from around the world) is on there talking about racial inequality.  I SAY "talking", but the guy is about three hundred years old, and has a British accent...so it's more like a long mumble with long vowels.  It's almost like his lips are trying not to let him say what he's trying to say, like he's fighting them to get his words past.  As for his teeth, I've mentioned that he's British.  I can't see them, but I bet they're horrible.     SHE is off to Bangor today, her friend is having a baby shower, and by divine intervention alone I was not made to go with her.  I can not picture a worse way to spend a leisurely Saturday than driving two hours north (with Anne offering constructive criticizm about my driving the ENTIRE WAY), having to go to Burlington Coat Factory for a present (I hate shopping), then going to this "shower" and watching some twit I've never met get presents for her yet-to-be-born offspring.  Then drive home-more constructive criticizm, I'd be getting snippy by this point, so I'm sure I wouldn't take her suggestions for the helpful things they normally are, we'd get in a fight, and I'd end up walking home from Gardiner (an hour north of me by car, you can imagine how quickly flip-flops would get me home).     Wireless internet: get it.  Now.  Even if you're a gamer, and some blowhard has managed to convince you that "you get better speed, faster response, etc." on a wired network.  I say this because at this very moment, I am no longer on my bed watching C-SPAN, but am in the bathroom.  See?  You didn't even notice that I had moved.  Wireless internet rules, but when combined with a notebook computer, it's quite possibly Wonder-Of-The-World material.     Ok, gotta focus on what I'm attempting to do...Budweiser wants out.

      I just showed HER my blog and she doesn't understand it at all...made a funny face, said  "I'm waiting for my girfriend to bring me sandwiches"  in one of those singsongy voices.  Then she asked me how many people I thought would look at my site.  I didn't want to let her win, so I responded with "lots".  I lied.     On an unrelated note, I believe that beer is one of God's miracles (especially when it comes in 40-ounce quantities with a budweiser label on it).

      Well, I'm waiting for HER to arrive to pick me up (her pile of poo car sounds less like a Mercury and more like a Harley-Davidson these days), and I thought it might be smart to try FireFox out as an alternative to IE6.    For the record, this browser looks great, installed easily, and imported all of my bookmarks/prefs from IE6 without a hiccup. I can now recommend this product wholeheartedly. Now let's see how www.collegehumor.com looks!

      I would like to go on record in favor of a PC user's license.&nbsp; Some people, you must be aware, have NO business owning a computer, much less one that functions.&nbsp; Maybe you and I are different than they are, maybe we spent our time playing video games as a child not just in awe of the flashing lights, but also thinking about how the thing worked.&nbsp; Maybe we thought that video games were much like personal computers (when they finally went mainstream).&nbsp; Maybe we drew parallels that make computer use easy for us that they somehow did not draw. &nbsp; Maybe they're dumb. &nbsp; I'm not kidding, if I have to reinstall the OS of some dumbass friend of mine ONE MORE TIME...Seriously, people!&nbsp; Get an antivirus program!&nbsp; Use it (this may mean spending a little more than the BARE MINIMUM when buying the PC, because more&nbsp;memory might be necessary for your eMachine to run more than one program at a time without exploding)! &nbsp; And I'm done :)

      Let&nbsp;me preface this by satating that I am NOT a journal sort of guy.&nbsp; I have no intention of gleaning life-altering wisdom from this, or selling it as a sort of "middle-to-late-twenties-coming-of-age-journey-blah-blah-blah".  &nbsp;  I will tell you that this will give me something to do on the off- (good) chance that there is nothing going on in the office at the moment.  &nbsp;  I will tell you that this will also contain some strong language at some points, but not as a rule.&nbsp; There's nothing like a good f-bomb every now and then to illustrate the height of the writer's emotion...consider yourself warned.  &nbsp;  Everquest is down at the moment, with the third patch in three days.&nbsp; Out of a possible 72 hours of play time, they've been patching for 7 of them.&nbsp; Bastards.
