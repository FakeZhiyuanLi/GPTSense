       Whassup!! Yesterday..I let it all out to Jenni.. What I've been wanting to say.. I guess I've been a bit too harsh on her but I just want to make her realize.. She understands how I feel and I really appreciate that. Jenni and me are fine now.. We're close and like each other's company.. I promised her I'll wait for her and I asked her whether she'll wait for me.. She will.. I'm really glad and grateful to hear that from her.. She still likes me and of course I do like her a lot.. Hehe! Things are getting normal between me and Jenni.. Today I woke up.. Had noodles for breakfast.. Went to the nearest plaza to get a haircut.. Kinda short but ok.. Bought some stationaries..

       Whassup!! It's me again.. But this time.. This post is something I already thought about for these past few days... It's about Jennifer and me.. We've been sorting things out.. And things turned out cool and we managed to get over the "rumours" thingy.. She heard it from Amanda which heard from Marcus.. *sIgHzZ*.. What is going on man... But above all.. I want to be with Jenni.. No matter what.. Rumours.. Gossips.. WtF*! I don't care.. Hahaha! By the way.. Ya'll heard the D-12 Song - How Come - ? I can rap man... Rap the song.. How cool is that?? Hahaha!! Cool.. Cool.. Well.. That's for now.. All I wanna know is that I wanna be with Jenni.. No matter what.. Love ya sweetie!

      "How come we dont even talk no more..And you dont even call no more".. Yeah... I just got off chatting with Jenni.. She had second thoughts bout the rumours I was talking about before.. Yeah.. She explained everything... I understand... And I poured what is inside my mind towards her.. She's afraid her friends might despice her and hate her.. I know that.. But the least she can do was to consider what her friends said and think rationally because it's between me and her.. Her friends may have opinions bout the relationships.. Some don't like it.. Most probably I'm not their race.. So.. Jenni.. If you're reading this post.. All I wanna say was.. Please think about it.. Think rationally and maturely.. It's between us.. Your friends may have objections bout us but you have the power to think which one is wrong and right. I know you can't live without your friends.. And I know they're important to you.. All I wanna you to do now is THINK....

       Whassup!! Today's Saturday... Kinda cool day for me.. Not much happenings today.. Woke up around 9.30am.. My cousins stayed over last night.. We played PS2 together..Kinda fun having some company.. Always alone at home..In my room..Hahaha!! Well..Had pizza for breakfast and went to school for this class.. At first I was thinking of not going but I changed my mind.. I went and it was worth it!! The class was small and very interesting.. The teacher was the husband of my Mother Tongue teacher.. He's cool.. Tought us ways of handling daily lives. Stress all that stuffs.. How to plan your schedule.. It's more like a workshop to me.. But no matter.. It's worth it and I learnt more about myself. Then after class.. Nashir and me went to have early lunch.. Cause it's near 12pm.. Wahahaha!! He kept on bragging bout being late to meet Michelle at Clementi Central. And he was eating so rushingly that his chin (got a bit of beard) was messingly full of curry...Hahahaha!!! It's kinda funny till he told me Jenni was nearby.. It suddenly changed my mood a bit.. But I can't see her as the bush is blocking my view.. I don't wanna know anymore.. Her image was banished from my mind.. I'm trying my best to forget her.. Concentrate on myself now.. She e-mailed me saying that I spread rumours about me and her going to the Prom Night together to Amanda.. Alright.. First of all.. I haven't talked to Amanda for a while now.. And second of all is that I lost my phone and no ways of me to memorising her number telling her that I'm going to the Prom Night with Jenni.. Please... *sIgHzZ* Rumours....But most of all is that I'm through with Jenni.. She said if she was going there.. She'll be going with her friends.. So..?? Am I going to beg her to go with me? HELL NAH... Like I have no friends like that... Bleah!! I don't wanna talk bout her anymore.. Well.. It's a cool day today.. So..Later... Peace Out!!

      But things turned out bad weeks after the date.. I sounded her to go on a steady relationship with me. But I was rejected.. The reason? She wanted to concentrate on her studies. Yeah.. I can agree with that.. She also include that we can be together after the 'O's. She even told me that her friends comes first. Can you believe that. It's between me and her and nothing to do with her friends.. It doesn't matter to me then.. We were on time-out.. Then this realtionship between Jenni and me started to fade.. She stops sms-ing me and seldomly get in contact. She wouldn't reply my smses anymore. And when we're online.. She always reply late.. Sometimes never at all.. I don't understand why she reacts this way man.. At first I thought she was the one. But I guess I'm wrong. I didn't obeyed my parents just to go out with her man.. I made many sacrifices for her. When my phone's low in credit, I took my cash and top it up just to get to her..  But I'm ok if she never sms or reply me when we're online.. The one fact I couldn't take was that for these past few days, she totally ignored me!! When I said totally I mean it. Even we saw each other.. She never even gave me a smile.. Not even a "Hi!" when we were face to face.. I guess from that moment onwards.. She has no more feelings towards me.. I guess it's history now....

       It was a very hot noon..Nashir and me are chilling out at KFC while waiting for Mas and Ah Seng to play CS. Then, I decided to explore his handphone. I saw Jennifer's number and asked him whether I can have it. He's cool with that. And I saved her number in my handphone. That very same day, after the game, I decided to sms her. At first I thought she wouldn't reply me back but I was wrong. She did reply me and we keep on sms-ing each other that we get closer as friends. On 14th June 2004, I got this idea of going out with her.. We confirmed on 17th that we'll be going out. From that moment onwards, I felt so great. Get to go out with the girl I was beginning to like. I bought her this Teddy Bear and a handphone initials. As gifts. 17th June 2004, the day.. I go to her block and waited for her. She turned up and we chatted all the way to JP. She wanted to go there and I was cool with it. We chatted in the bus. She was just so adorable. I can't get my eyes off her! When we reached JP, we went to have an early dinner vecause we already bought the tickets to watch "Around The World In 80 Days". We ate slowly and I was observing her eyes all along. Really.. She's so cute.. We stroll around JP while waiting for the movie to start. I buy her this Danish ice-cream and she was like so excited coz' it was kinda big. Hehe! Yup.. We continue to walk and stop upon this shop and we browse inside. She liked this handphone key-chain and I bought it for her even though she insist. I wouldn't mind. I'd do anything for her.. In the theatre, while watching we were so close. She enjoyed the movie. After it, we decided to have a photo taken together.We took one. A Neocard. I hugged her coz' she didn't mind. I felt very fortunate coz' I get to hug her on my first date! How cool was that.?! After all, I send her to her friend's BBQ at West Coast Park. We walked slowly there from JTPS. I wanted to hold her hands but I'm afraid she might not get use to it. Coz' it's too early.. When we stepped up on the entrance of the West Coast Park.. I know it's goodbye. I gave her the gifts I bought her. And we said goodbye... From that moment onwards.. I kept on thinking of her day and night.. Couldn't stop..

Then there's this one Sec. 1 SC.. Damn, f*cking irritating man.. Play with my Dad's name.. I hate that man.. I, myself nearly get myself into trouble.. Luckily for him my friend stops me.. I nearly smack the guy on his face man... What a dickh*ad.. I had an English class after school.. Sat beside Sam.. One thing which I couldn't forget is that my Jenni... She TOTALLY ignored me man... The whole day.. Why?! I'm so bumped out by her actions.. It's like we're strangers and didn't knew each other.. No smile.. Not even a "Hi!".. I'm really, really bumped out today man... It's not the first time she ignored me like this... Nah... She probably don't like me anymore... What to do.. No point of chasing something you can't even catch.. Right? Sounds hopeless.. Anyway.. Tired..Bored (As usual).. I think this is enough for today man... See ya'll tomorrow.. Peace out!!
