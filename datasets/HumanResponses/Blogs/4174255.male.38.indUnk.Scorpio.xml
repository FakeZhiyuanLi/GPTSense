       urlLink    All in all we just had a great time. The weather was just great, right around 85 in the day and right around 75-80 during the evening and night time. Vera, we had an elephant ear for you and some corn on the cob, thank you Bob. We didn't run into as many people as we usually do, I don't understand. Oh well, in a small town we see them all the time anyway. The fair missed you, Vera. Hope one year you can come back and enjoy the sights, sounds and smell of all the food with us. I'm sure the kids would love it. ( If we could get them off the rides!)  urlLink

       urlLink    Well, we went to the County Fair last Night and a great time was had by all. Here I am in my new car, at least for the fair grounds! I thought just old crippled people used these....... Hmmmmmm. Oh well, the food and the lights were just what I needed to get out out of the sulking I have been doing for the last few weeks. We ate, walked the exhibits and looked at all the entries made by the little kids and adults alike. I cant tell you what the smells of the food and the excitement of the midway does to me. It just seems to take me back to being a kid again. No, I didn't go on any rides this year, but, I would have loved too! (This was the only ride I got all night!) Oh well, there's always next year. If you look, and you don't have to look to hard, you will see the scar on my knee from the surgery. It's healing up very nice and just cant wait to be walking normal again. I will post some more pics on the blog.  urlLink

      P T went well today, spent an hour in the pool doing stretching exercises. Things are getting better with the knee every day. I'm not using my pain meds as often and I know that's a good sign. I just wish I could walk normal! Oh well, that will come, I know that for a fact.  I have been sleeping allot better at night, therefore, my moods have been pretty good this week. I have only been getting up 1-2 times a night rather than the 4-6 times I was getting used to doing. So very happy that parts done!  We are going to walk the fair tonight, have to go look in the pavilion and snack on the food, but, instead of walking this year, I am going to use a wheel chair. Yehaaaaaaa! Oh well, it's either sit back and pity myself because I cant walk through it or find a way to make it work! So, I am making it work!  See you all soon!

      I just have one question.................. Why does life never turn out the way you have planned? Even when you do things right, things never turn out the way you wanted. Does this mean I have turned into a 5 year old again saying "That's not fair?" No, I don't think so. I feel that as you grow older you expect things to be a certain way and when there not, "It's not fair." I wish, and I know it's silly to want to even think about this, but, do you remember what it was like when you were 10 years old? Not having a care in the world. The only thing you worried about was if your best friend was still mad at you for tricking him into eating that worm! Remember staying out until dark playing "Good guys / Bad guys"? Or "Cops and Robbers"? Then your Mom would call you in to have your bath and get ready for bed. Everything was provided for you. There were no worries. You had a house, water, electricity and everything else anyone on the block could possible want. Your parents didn't have to sacrifice anything for everything you had............................................ Or did they?  Now that I am in my parents shoes............. I wonder........................ Did they ever think life was unfair? Did they ever want to be 10 again? And then I wonder, when my parents were my age.......... Did they ever wonder if there parents ever thought life was unfair and wish THEY could be 10 again.  I guess all I'm saying is no matter how much of life I think is unfair, everyone has or is going through it, or will go through it. It's a part of life. It doesn't make things any easier or any better for that matter, but, at least we have the ones who love us and care about us. We have the ones who know that we are doing the best we can and that sometimes, no matter what you do all your life, your thrown a curve ball..................................  Even in saying all that and believing what I wrote................................................  Damn it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not FAIR!!!!!!!!! It's just not fair at all!!!!!!!

      Sorry, I didn't write yesterday after P T. I was so sore and tired that I didn't spend much time on the computer yesterday. The good news is I am starting to sleep better. I have been getting up once a night for the last couple of days!!!! The bad news is I have been so damn grumpy. I think most of this is due to the fact that I just sit on my ass most of the time! I'm getting so tired of sitting there when it seems like I'm getting better, but, I know better than that. Every time I go out and do to much, I am in pain for days, so, I know it's not worth it. Even with knowing that things are healing and I know my leg is getting better every day, it doesn't make it any easer sitting in that chair. I have been going outside from time to time and sit, so, I think I need to do more of that so I dont go to Loco. You really can only look at the same 4 walls so long before going a little crazy! Ok now that I have that off my chest.............................................................  Our friend Sally went into the hospital Monday morning for surgery. We went to see her last night and she was so drugged up. It was so funny and I don't really think she will even remember us coming up there. She was just staring at the drug button waiting for the 10 min mark so she could push the bottom again. I don't know if she put that thing down the whole time we were there, but, I do know she started getting cramps in her finger from holding on to it for so long and so hard. She was told she was going to be blogged, so here it is!!!! Get well soon Sally!!!!!  Ok, to all you Allen's Blog Junkies, I will be posting again tomorrow and I am so sorry for not writing yesterday. Please, Brandi, forgive me!

      Life has been rather hard this weekend. I really don't know what has happened, but, I have been so tired. I slept most of the day, on and off, and just felt shitty!  I start the advanced P T tomorrow and hope things go well. I don't see how it wont and can't wait to get off these crutches. (Yes I'm still on the crutches and hope to move back to the cane very shortly. )  Stan spent the entire day on Saturday cleaning and scrubbing the pool to make it nice and clean for Hailie. Our pump had gone out a few days ago and the pool has been turning some funny colors. Sally and Dick brought over an extra pool pump they had from there pool and now ours looks nice and sparkling clean. We thank you and I'm sure Hailie thanks you too!  I would like to thank all the friends and family that have called and sent well wishes through emails. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I will be writing again Monday after P T and hope to have good news about my progress. Until then, have a great rest of the weekend!

       urlLink    Here I am getting measured.   I MADE IT  !!!!!! 3 weeks and 3 days after surgery, I can bend my leg  120 deg . This is a huge step on the road to recovery and I am   VERY   excited. Now I need to make sure I am walking correctly and bending my knee the way I have been told.   This was a fantastic day!!!!!!    urlLink

       urlLink    This is not my exray either, but, it shows what a knee like mine looked like before surgery, ( on the left.) It also shows the front and the side views of the knee now. The only difference in this one and mine is the fact that I only have one screw going into the upper part of the knee. The one I have is right in the middle, the smaller one is not there.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is not my exray, but, this is exactly what I had done to my knee. The upper part is the new joint and the lower part is the cartilage. You can't see that part as well because it's made from plastic. That will more than likely be the part that will fail first. Hopefully that wont happen for 10-15 years!&nbsp; urlLink

      I got piece of good news today at the doctor. I was told the knee is heeling very well and the scar on the knee looks very good. I can stop taking the blood thinner now, but, I need to continue on the pain management pills for a few more weeks. I saw an exray of my knee that they had taken just after surgery while I was still in the recovery room, believe it or not I was fully awake in recovery. Anyway, the xray shows the metal piece that is now the upper joint and the lower piece were he had to chisel away my bone to put in the new cartilage. I also saw how he has totally straiten out my leg. There is no more bow in the right leg! Sounds kind of gross, and I'm sure the surgery was, but the exray looked very cool. I am still using the cane, but, I would love to go back and use the crutches again. My knee has never been this sore. The pain is incredible! I'm dealing with it, but, it seemed to be getting a lot better before I moved on to the cane. After I moved on, the knee just hurts! I know I am using it more than I did with the crutches, but   DAMN  . I know things will improve, I'm just venting. That's what this blog is for! I am still unable to drive for another 3 weeks, at least. I cant even think about driving until I go back in to see the doctor on September 3rd. At that appointment, the doctor will tell me if I can drive, how much longer I need to go to therapy and how much longer I can't work. This will be the appointment that we will find out how successfully the surgery was. ( I already know it was a success.) I may be griping about the pain, but I am taking the pain meds less and less, and at fewer times in the day! I will write again tomorrow after P T. I have to still go 2 times a week. But, hope to move up to the advanced class next week. Thank you for taking time out to visit my little corner of the web. Hope your all doing well and will see you soon.

       Physical therapy went very well today! My knee is doing just what it needs to be. I stopped using the crutches, at least around the house. Today and was told to just use them on uneven surfaces! I can bend my knee 112 degrees and I am only 2 degrees from making it go completely flat! I got balled out for doing to much though. I try to sit in the chair at home, but, I get a little restless and try and do things I can't do yet. I need to sit more, ice my leg and get up less. The weather is just to nice to be sitting in the house all day.    Speaking of weather, I just love it out there!!!!!! 104 deg Yesterday!!!! I laid outside for a little bit and read the paper and just soaked up the rays! I can get my leg wet in a week, so, no pool until then. I can't wait. The only problem is the pump went out on the pool and were afraid we may need to take it down before the summer is over.     I have an appointment with my surgeons assistant tomorrow for my 3 week postop appointment. Things should go well. The scar is healing very nicely and with the way it's beginning to bend, I think she will be pleased. I will still be unable to drive for 3 more weeks, but, that's the breaks! It's kind of nice being driven all over the place and not have to think about it! Hmmmmm I wonder how long I will be able to stretch that one out????    I will update all who are interested in what the doctor has to say tomorrow. I can't forsee any problems and hope she says all is healing well.    Don't forget, if you leave a comment on one of my postings, please leave your name at the end of the comment so I know who left it. Thank you!

       urlLink    Here is the front yard. I wish I could take the credit for the way the yard looks, but I can't. Since my surgery, Stan has really been doing a fantastic job at keeping the lawn looking it's best. We even had help from our friend, Karen Landis. She came over last Weekend and helped Stan pull weeds in the front yard. Thanks again, Karen. With the temp. Starting to reach 100 deg. I doubt I will be able to get Stan to do his chores in the yard! I will post some pictures of the flowers in the field across the street. The festival has begun and the fields are getting full of people from all around the state. It's so pretty looking out the front window and seeing our view. We really take it for granted. If we go for a walk through the dahlias tonight, I will take the camera and post some close up pictures of the flowers so you all can enjoy them to. During the Dahlia Festival, please feel free to come by and walk the fields and visit. It's really a great time of year out here and we love to have people stop by for a visit! Don't be shy, just call and let us know you will be out this way and we will let you know if we will be home. Well, I need to get up and do something, so, I will write more later. Right now I need to go and lay in the sun. (Hey, the doctor told me to take it easy for six weeks, so, I might as well have a good tan!!!!)  urlLink

      Well, it's 2:00 and 91 deg outside. Stan is mowing the lawn and I wish I could be doing yard work too. It's very hard to sit back and have to have others do things that you enjoy doing. Rolls are reversed around here today. I'm in on the computer when I would much rather be out mowing and just doing yard work. The flowers are all in bloom and the dahlias are in full bloom now in the fields. People are starting to drive by the house now to look at the fields and walk through them. Traffic will soon be very busy here in the coming weeks.  I am feeling better after my knee surgery and the P T is working. I have been overdoing it again and I feel every pain I have in my knee today. I am thinking of not going to the advanced P T class on Monday, but rather going to the beginners class again for just one more week. I am bending my leg allot better now and the pain is really getting better. I should be moving up to a cane sometime next week and stop using the crutches. I stopped using the walker last week and was so happy to fold it up and put it away. I know it has only been 3 weeks, but, sometimes it feels like it's been a month. I still have not been able to sleep at night. I am getting up 4-6 times a night, but, the doctor says that will go away. Sometimes it takes up to 6-8 weeks for that to go away.   AAAAAGGGGHHHHHH
