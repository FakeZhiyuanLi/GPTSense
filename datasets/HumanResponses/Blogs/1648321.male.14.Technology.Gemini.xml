      It has been awhile since I updated this blog. Since school started, I haven't had much time and I kind of forgot about Blogger. But I hope to update it on a regular basis now. Probably not every day, but hopefully at least a once or a few times a week. Please try to look back every few days (if you care at all). I might have interesting and fun facts. Or maybe I'll post my blog on my new website I'm building. It'll have a brand new, clean, crisp, organized interface. Well, it is a school night, so I better go.

      Tomorrow is Friday. Today was pretty good until my math test. Then it was absolutely terrible. Oh well - At least everything else is good. Amit and I might have a sleep-over Friday night and then go to this SSC Local Cable class thing.  Might rent a movie, go bowling, or something else. (I don't know what).

Computer, morning cartoons
around 9:00 am - Got dressed and went out to breakfast at Highland Grill with my dad, had breakfast.
10:00 am - My SSC class started with Amit (really boring, stupid, long)
4:00 pm - FINALLY WAS OVER!!! Went home did some chores/jobs, practiced piano.
6:00 pm - Mindy came over and we watched National Security again (REALLY FUNNY MOVIE!) after we had dinner and played a bit
9:20 pm - Movie ended, hung out until bed time
10:00 pm - Mom/Dad came home. I quickly got in bed.

Well - there is my day! 5 hours was the stupid SSC TV show production class thing with Amit. (I DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH).

      (I was originally going to post this on Friday, but I ran out of time.)
Yea! It is Friday! I can't wait for the weekend! :-) I am having a sleepover with Jacob Penn tonight. It will be so fun! I went to MPA's first annual Cultural Fair. It was really cool and funny and had good food! I went to Galyan's and I'm getting a Spider jacket 8-) Emi is coming on Sunday and we're going out to dinner! What fun!

Now here is what really happened:
The sleepover with Jake was really cool. We went to Blockbuster and rented F-ZERO GX - AWESOME GAME!!!!, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Enter the Matrix for GameCube. All the games rocked! We also rented Stuntman the DVD - also really good movie! Zack came over on Saturday morning. It was fun. On Saturday afternoon I went to tennis. I won King of the Court. Mindy baby-sat that night and Emi paid a short visit. Sunday I didn't have to go to church! (But instead I had to do homework and other jobs). I have to read The Foundation by Asimov (REALLY STUPID BOOK!!!!). I did work and jobs the rest of Sunday and Emi came and we went to Red Robin (the whole family). Laura, me, and Emi played 500 after we got home. Then she left and I studied for a few quizzes and tests and here I am right now. This week has 3 B days (YES!) and only 2 A days! Emi is coming to one of my soccer games. Well this is probably boring you so I'll say catcha L8er! ;-)

      We won our soccer game to Saint Rose yesterday. We are an all-boys team (blue, MPA Panthers), but they were a co-ed team (red). I scored a cool goal along with a lot of other awesome shots. We really beat them 6-0, but about half a second before the ref blew the whistle, Ryan scored a goal. (But then the ref said that he blew the whistle before the goal.) Last time we played this team we beat them 12-1. Haha! ;-) Piano was boring (as usual). But the whole family and Emi and her friend, Katie all went to izzy's ice cream! I did HMK when we got home and I had to read this stupid "CLASSIC" book until after 10:00 pm. Well today is a B day, so I hope it is good! :-)

      Hey! I didn't have the time earlier to report the weekend. So here it is now, and more:

The weekend was pretty fun. Me, my sisters, and my dad went to the Highland Grill on Saturday morning. I did some homework. I went to tennis. Oh yeah! - I forgot to tell ya that my glasses broke! They are the bendable frame, and I had shown them off so much at school that they became out of shape and was weak. I got so mad that I broke it in two other places - 3 places total! I'm lucky cause they are still under warranty. Anyway - On Saturday night I went out with my friend Zack to the movies @ the MOA! But I had to see "Good Boy!" (you know that dog/people movie). Sunday was the usual - work, work, work. But I actually got my work done early so our family had a "dance party" (it was embarrassing). Well today was okay - AM HIST sucked, in BAND we had a counting test (worth 80 points) and in FRENCH I got a redo ("see me") 10 out of 25 on a quiz we had. MATH was okay - Two HMK assignments, andcorrections as usual. We had a fire drill and I almost had a heart attack. Well I have a lot more to say but I'm running out of time - I'll tell ya more soon!

They are sleeping in my room so I have to do a lot of cleaning. Mamie is also going to be with Laura. On Wednesday, we get out of school early @ 11:30 am! Mom, Laura, Kelly, me, grandma, papa, and Mamie might be going all out for lunch! Then - we're gonna kick 'em out because we're (mom+dad+laura+kelly+geoff) are all driving to Chicago, Illinois to visit Emi for the long MEA weekend! Today is a B day so thats good, and - tomorrow we only have our morning A day classes. 8-)

      Hello! Back from the LONG MEA weekend. We went to Chicago after Grandparents and Special Friends Day (up through 6th grade). We did all go out to eat at Syndney's. After that we went home, G/P packed and so did we. They left before us, then we left for our long 6-hour drive to Chicago! It was REALLY COOL and FUN! I'll tell you more later. Well this week goes B, A, B, A, B. So it's good for me and bad for my sister (she likes A days).

      I haven't posted awhile, I should have done it maybe a day or two after the previous post, but I forgot to update this blog, and kind of forgot my username and password, but now I'm back! This week is really cool! We only have Mon. (B day) and Tue. (A day) for school, and then we have Thanksgiving Break for 5 DAYS! IT is AWESOME! I'm having a sleepover with Zach on Tuesday night, and we are having Thanksgiving brunch at Mamie's house on Thursday, and then early Friday morning, we are going to drive 4 HRS to Grandma and Papa's! Plus the next school week after that favors B days (B,A,B,A,B). And my website is being RE-DONE, so you can check it out (IT IS REALLY COOL) @ http://geoffmyers1.tripod.com! Thanks a lot and I hope you have a Happy Turkey Day! ;-)

      This weekend my mom is going down to Des Moines to my grandparents to help them (I don't know exactly what for). So It'll be me, my sister, my other sister, and my dad. I have a soccer game as usual on Saturday morning at 11:00 am, and I have tennis at around 1:00 pm. Luckily, I don't have much homework. We had a big unit test yesterday in Math (I hope I passed and at least got some sort of B). Today is an easy day since it is a B day. In English, we already read a book called "Jemmy." Now we are reading "Four Miles to Pinecone." Both stories take place in Minnesota. My fish, so called "Dragon" is still alive. I can't believe how long he has lived. For about 3 or 4 months now. So is Kelly's "Flower" fish. Both are Betas in little jars. I try to feed them every other 1 or 2 days. I clean the bowls every week. Well, I think this is a long enough post.

      This week it is an A, B, A, B, A week, which is bad. But- There is only this week and then next week, and then it is Winter Break! 8-) We get two weeks off for X-Mas and New Year's. I hope it doesn't fly by, because then there's another A, B, A, B, A week after that. ;-) I have a huge 80-point Band Playing Test. Just to give you an idea how much it is worth - 100 points is a concert, and we have TWO every year. This Playing Test is worth 80 points! I have to play Simple Gifts (2, 4) [Marimba], Into the Storm [Temple Blocks], and Bleak Midwinter [Bass Keyboard]. Well I GTG now. L8ER!!

      So far, this week has gone pretty good. Eventhough I only got a C+ on my math test, I still have a B for my quarter grade. Plus, I have all of my math homeworks done for Friday. My Playing Test went pretty good, I got a B+/A- (it was like 89.9%). There wasn't any piano on Tuesday - we got to skip it. In science we made balloon cars and I made two. Today is a nice relaxing B day. I have PE (we're playing Badmitton), then English (I have my HMK done), then Advisory (we're planning our lip-sync), then lunch and recess, then Computer Pro (we are making our iMovies, and I'm bringing my DVCAM), then art (we're doing 1-point perspective line drawings), then science (balloon cars). Yeah, I know it sounds like a busy day but most of it is pretty fun. Well, anyway, that's how the cookie crumbles. ;-)

      YEA!!!! WINTER BREAK IS ALMOST HERE!!!! JUST TWO MORE DAYS TO GO!!!! Today is an A day, but we are having a pizza/pop/party day in band. In French we have a Culture Quiz (pretty super easy), and in math we are having another party with stockings full of candy and pop!!! One drawback - we have a big test in AMerican HISTory (I HOPE I GET A GOOD GRADE! ;-) It is right away in the morning so I'll get it over with soon and I hear kids say that it isn't too hard, but I have a 3-page review sheet + more questions. OH - AND in Study Hall with Ms. Bergren we are probably also going to watch Finding Nemo again just like on Tuesday! That'll be cool! Emi is coming today to go out for dinner and hang out! That's COOL. Well I got up early this morning, so I have to go study for the test, once that is over, it's time to PARTY!!!! :-) :-D 8-) 8-D

      So far, Winter Break has been pretty good. I went to to see "Stuck on You" (It was a funny movie). And I also went ice skating at the old Train Depot last night. Tonight I am going to the Minnesota Wild game at the Xcel Energy Center with Zach and then we are having a sleepover. Yesterday, Robert came over and stayed at our house the whole day (from 9:30 AM to 8:00 PM). I'm excited for Christmas. Well, I hope all of you are having a nice Holiday Break! Thanks a lot! ;-)

      YEA!!! Tonight, my dad and I are going to the Mall of America to the Apple Store to get my PowerBook G4!!!! I have saved up over $500 plus another $600+ for my iMac that I am selling to Zach! We got back from grandma and papa's in Des Moines. Brenton, Paula, and Yogi were there. It was a fun time. I didn't get much else for Christmas except for a few little things and a lot of money and "puzzle-pieces" that count toward my PB G4. Laura got a brand-new hamster for XMAS that she named, "Snickers." (Another name which I liked better was, "Scooter.") On Saturday, I bought Burnout 2: Point of Impact for GameCube. I just got it today and it is AWESOME!!! I already beat the 30 crash zones, getting mostly bronze and silver, and quite a few gold metals. Zach is flying back to New York tonight, but I'll hopefully get to play with him before he goes. Amit's B-Day party was yesterday (the 28th). He isn't having a party this week, but hopefully soon. For New Year's Eve, I might also have a friend over for a sleepover (hopefully). I have two songs stuck in my head right now, "Stacy's Mom" and "Hey Ya!" This is a pretty long post, so I'll stop right here. Have a Happy New Year 2004!!!! :-P :-D 8-) ~*smilies*~

      Today is December 31, 2003 (the last day in the year). Tonight I was going to have Amit sleep-over, but I know he doesn't care at all. I will be having a ton of sugar so I might get a little hyper tonight. Plus, I am now on my PowerBook, typing this. The aluminum structure on this PB is so awesome. Last night I synced my iMac with my PowerBook and put them on the exact same settings for an aquarium screen-saver, and it was so cool! I still need to do homework (actually it is all done, but done extremely poorly). So I'll talk to you next year, 2004! 8-D

      The 16 days of winter vacation are now over. Today was the first day back. It was an A day. Fortunately, it was a GOOD day. I get to bring my PowerBook tomorrow to school because in Computer Proficiency we are doing an iMovie project, and it is due Thursday, but we are not going to finish in class, so I'll edit the movie on my PowerBook at home instead. (Of course it is fun to just have my PB at school for fun.) We do have a math test on Thursday (which I still need to study for). I hope I get a good score higher than a C+. The corrections for our math assignments are now online, so that helps a lot. Anyway, no homework in French today. Almost done with American History homework (pretty easy), and easy corrections for math. You probably now are almost falling asleep because of this boring school stuff, so I'll let you go nighty-night now because this post is over now.

      Yea! Steve Jobs today introduced a brand new line of Apple products! Brand new Mini iPods that come in a bunch of new colors and hold 1000 songs. Finally, the Xserve is updated to one and dual G5 processors. The new iLife has brand new version of iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, and iMovie. Plus the brand new music-making app from Apple called GarageBand! Right now I'm watching the streaming QuickTime movie on my dual-monitor. It's so awesome! Plus my mom just got a new white Volvo XC90 SUV today! Today is a TOTALLY AWESOME DAY!!! YEA!!!!

      This is the schedule for my weekend:
Saturday:
10:30 AM - Piano Group Lesson (maybe takes an hour or so)
1:00 PM to 4:00 PM - 7/8 Band Saturday Rehearsal (at MPA)
4:00 PM --> will be at Amit's birthday party sleep-over.
Sunday:
(Still at Amit's and skip church)
And I don't know what happens after that.
A pretty boring weekend other than the awesome time at Amit's.
I took my PowerBook to school and found out the school network password this week.
And I just remembered I got 102 out of 100 on my BIG math test! YEA! I got the highest score in the whole class. I can't believe it because last time I only got a C+ (as you will see earlier in the blog).
Well thanks a lot for checking back at my blog and don't stop it!

      This weekend was the fastest weekend EVER. It seemed like it was half a day. On Saturday morning at 10:30, we had our piano group lesson (which was VERY boring). Then we got home like around noon, had lunch, I packed for Amit's, and then I was on my way to the three hour band rehearsal - ON A SATURDAY!!! After that, though, it was all good. The band rehearsal went well, and we got a break in the middle for a quick snack of chocolate-chip cookies and chips. We did out concert run-through the first half, then we fixed the problems in the second half. The sleepover with Amit and Robert @ Amit's house was really fun (I forgot Amit's present). We went bowling (I won 2/3 games), then we went home and played video games, both on the big-screen and on the screen in Amit's room, and watched 2Fast2Furious on the projection-screen. We had pizza as usual. Then we made a movie (which is already being done edited in iMovie). It is about RC cars. We played F-Zero GX, Burnout 2, Need For Speed Underground, and a lot more. We had pancakes for breakfast (we woke up @ about 10:00), then we did a bit more and packed up. I went home at about 12:00 (noon).

      I just got home today and my beta fish, called "Dragon" died. Kelly's fish, called "Flower" died just a few days ago. Now there are no fish in our family anymore. You might say, "Oh it's only a fish," but it wasn't. I had another fish about a year ago, named "Ralf," but it was a plain-old white goldfish who lived only two weeks. I bought "Flower" and "Dragon" at the end of September or in October. These are the longest-living fish I have ever had. From October-January for a little tiny fish is a long time. Well, they are gone now, forever.

      Today I have my BIG Band Playing Test (It's part 2). I am playing "Shalom!" (which is on the Xylophone), "Black Wolf Run" (which is on the Timpani), and "Capriccio Espagnol" (which is on the Snare Drum). I have practiced hard, so I hope that I get at least some sort of B on it (hopefully an A). It is at 2:10 PM this afternoon (during math). But since I have to be ready to play at 2:10, I must leave about five minutes early or more since I must setup the Timpani and set my music out. At every lesson that we go to, we have to have this "list," which is where we put the hard parts on to work on and practice. Well thanks a lot and wish me luck - I've gotta go now!

      For Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, the Knudsons and the Myers are going up north to a cross-country ski resort called Maplelag. This is a yearly tradition and I won't have any new posts to my blog until at least Sunday night (I'll probably have it updated on Monday maybe). Well I hope all of you have a great three-day weekend and have tons of fun!

      Today we just got back from our vacation to Maplelag cross-country skiing resort in Callaway, MN. In my opinion, it was okay. I don't think it was as good as previous times there. Peter and I did get to learn how to ski-skate (or skate-ski). We learned the V1, the V2 and the technique for going up hills since the ski bottoms don't have any treads so you slide easily. Well I think my homework is almost done for tomorrow and Wednesday (this is only a 4-day week). 
Other news:
I am updating my website (with cool aqua-pill rollover buttons for my navigation)
iLife '04 is NOW shipping (with GarageBand).
Spymac 3 was released (you MUST check it out - it's still a beta though)

      Today in science class, we got a new teacher. Our old teacher, Ms. Nagle, is leaving MPA for the rest of the year since she is having a baby. I think the new teacher is okay (but it's the first day, so I'll give him a break). Other news: Ms. Stoltz today got really ticked off in PE. In English, we are "Building Vocabulary for College." We are practicing our lip-sync in advisory (we are doing Funkytown). We had good sub-sandwiches today for lunch. I edited my website during recess, study-hall was boring as usual, and art was boring and sort of stupid. We are doing this "Lord of the Rings" project (which sounds fun, but isn't). It is after school and I am waiting for my mom to arrive and pick me up. My sister stayed home today. I have a dentist appointment after school. Well, I GTG (got to go) now. See ya later!

      Today is the saddest day of my life. Today, Maggie, our 14-year-old Cockapoo, is getting put to sleep. She is going to Dog Heaven to live with God for eternity. She won't suffer anymore, she won't feel anymore pain. Maggie contributed to the Myers family for all of my life, 13 1/2 years. Maggie is older than me, but after school today, I will come home, and she will be gone; forever on earth. Maggie is and will be an Angel Dog. She might come down and visit us. She will sleep on our beds, sit in her usual places, and still eat secretly out of her food and water bowl. My mom and dad are going to the vet sometime from noon to when my mom picks me up after school (around 3:30). For all of us, today will be one of the toughest days, ever. I have created a movie about Maggie; a slideshow of pictures of her. This movie is so sad, I cannot watch it. This post still isn't very long; not even close to as long as Maggie's wonderful life. We all love her, and we will miss her. Amen.

      It is hard to adjust to things that you aren't used to. I have to change the whole lifestyle I have because Maggie isn't here anymore. It will take days, weeks, months for all of us to get used to no dog. I wish I could have said goodbye just one more time before she had to leave. :'(

But anyway:
Today is a Friday! (that is good if you didn't know ;-) After school today we are going to Blockbuster to rent a movie. (I want to get the Revenge of the Nerds.) Laura and I are going to babysit Kelly tonight, so we need something to entertain both us and Kelly. It's a B day - that's good. I don't know what else is happening over the weekend yet; I'll post a new entry when I find out. ;-)

      Tonight I have a band concert in the NC at 7:00. We have to leave before 6:00 because of Laura. The 7/8 Band are playing 8 pieces (I play in 7 of them). Laura is also playing in the 5th Grade Band. Other News: I finally got iLife '04! Now I can make music with GarageBand! Wish both myself and Laura good luck at the band concert!

      This week has gone pretty well even though today is another A day. The concert went well on Monday night. I don't know what else to say because I can't seem to remember what happened (I am barely awake right now). I have a new computer consulting job today in the neighborhood for the first time. It has been a week since Maggie died. The house still seems empty without her. In GarageBand, I have 10 cool songs that I will be selling on my own album. My iTunes library went from a little over 600 songs to over 900 songs now! I'm not sure what the weekend will be like, but i'll try to tell you as soon as I find out. Thanks!

      Tomorrow I have a lot of stuff. First off: We are starting the Heritage Project in American HIstory (which is REALLY big), second, in band we are starting with brand new pieces and I can't sight read or play them at all, third, I have a Playing Test in band (which is the last of the year, but I have to play a solo), fourth, I have to study two pages in our French book of the colors (boring) and other stuff, fifth, I have a HUGE math test on Thursday on Probability, which is really hard. All of this is for Thursday!!! How the heck do I get ALL this done by tomorrow??!!!! Well I'll have to find out a way!!!

Good news though: The weekend was great and this week the 5678 Café is open to 5-8 grade to get Krispy Kremes, brownies, cookies, chocolate, and more! :-)

      Okay, just a few days ago (on Saturday), I got a MIDI-USB converter (for those who have NO clue what I am talking about, I'll explain). I couldn't get the MIDI to work within GarageBand until two nights ago (help from Robert over IM). What MIDI stands for is Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI is better than regular audio because it has much higher sound quality, it takes up less space, you can use almost any instrument in the world with it, it is REALLY easy to modify the notes you play wrong on (on the computer in GB). Anyway, I am sorry that I haven't update by blog with REAL news lately. I'll try to get back into the schedule, but I've been pretty busy. ;-)

      Today is the last day of school for this week! :-D It is a Spirit Day so we don't have to be in uniform/dress code. In gym, we are going sledding outside. In English, we are FINALLY done with NFW (Night Flying Woman). We are still planning for conferences in advisory (mine is tonight at 5:30). Obviously after that is lunch and recess. ;-) Then in study hall I have to make-up some stuff in science. In art, we are starting to make these "pots" that we make out of "slabs." And then after that is science class. After that, IT'S THE WEEKEND FOR FOUR WHOLE DAYS!!!! The weekend: Grandma (and maybe Papa) are coming I think on Saturday. Hopefully I'll be able to go downhill skiing with Amit or a sleep-over with another friend. There is a ceremony this weekend when I get my art reward at the collage of art and design. I know there is lots more (like homework), so I'll tell you how everything goes! Have a GREAT day!!! :-) :-D

Thanks a lot and enjoy the new blog! :-)

      I forgot to tell you that I got a PS1 and a mini-screen from Zach for only $50! I sold my old PS1 (without screen) on eBay for $30. I got a few cables/adapters so now I can hook it up to my GameCube for portable gaming anywhere! It's pretty sweet! ;-) Also, I went to Ax-Man twice this weekend to get some cool junk. It was cool (and funny). I got a real old bowling pin, a "NO TRESPASSING" yellow strip, and a stupid tiny metallic lunch box. And I now have complete virtual control over all computers on our small home network - which includes my mom and dad's computer! ;-) This is enough to say for now, but I could go on... and on... and on...

      I am so sorry for not updating my blog lately! I have been so busy I hadn't gotten a chance. The four-day weekend was great. Last week went pretty well, and today was a good day, along with the weekend was exceptional. I went to a motorcorss on Saturday night with Zach. It was really cool because we were in the sixth row and right next to a big jump, so all the motorbikes went above where we were. Zach goes to a year-round school in NY, so he got last week off and he went back to NY yesterday (at least I'm pretty sure of that). I got to go out to breakfast at the Highland Grill on Saturday morning. Oh and I forgot to mention I went shopping on Friday night (it was pretty boring). I got cool new Nike running shoes and nice Wilson tennis shoes since I had tennis from 1:30-3:00 PM on Saturday. I took my PowerBook around town in the car and found 40+ wireless networks just from only two routes! Now I am really bugging my parents (mostly my dad) to get wireless internet! I can't believe I still use ethernet cables! :-P I don't know if I already said this but I have 1141 songs right now in my iTunes library! :-) This week is in fact an A, B, A, B, A week but we have a non-uniform day every day with a theme. Today was pajama day (since it's Monday it's always hard to get out of bed). I hope this is a long-enough post to make-up the days I didn't post! Thanks a lot and have a good week too! :-D
