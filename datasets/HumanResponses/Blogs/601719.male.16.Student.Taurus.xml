      Today I talked to my mother about my poor grade in that class. She was talking about how if I ever got a C my life would change drastically and I could not travel anymore. She stated that she doesn't spend money on people who get C's. I burst into tears...she asks me what's wrong, as if she can't guess. I explain everything, and she  tries  to comfort me, but her dissapointed tone doesn't calm my unstable emotions. She sighs and tells me she won't cancel my trips. I try to smile, it doesn't work. I try to explain to her how much pressure I feel is on me, after bein g pushed to do so many activities...and I don't do drugs or get in trouble and I'm usually nice and polite...and yet I still find after one mistake I'm not good enough for her....she scolds me trying to make her feel guilty.   It's all my fault. I should have checked my grade with the teacher more often. It's just.....my new teacher (my previous science teacher moved away to be with her husband...I loved her.) is just so cold. If we ask him for help he laughs at us. He gives us vague assignments (e.g.: once he said "Record the weather forcast for 5 days and give me the results." that's all. We all did it, and afterwards he yelled at us for not following requirements. Apparently we didn't catch the part about wind speed, direction, dew point, sunrise/set, and humidity.), he never gives us progress reports, he writes an assignment in small letters on a corner of the whiteboard (there are notes up there from other classes, too) and never says anything about them, there are no due dates, and he sets the amount of points for an assignment depending on how many people do it. I place a little blame on him, I guess. I just never felt comfortable when I can't figure out a formula or a problem. The thing that gets me the most is the lack of due dates...I need structure.  After crying in my room for an hour or so, my father comes down and reminds me of how he doesn't love me because of my grades, but because I'm a good person and I try really hard. That uberly made me feel better....for a moment I almost forgot how much of a huge deal the whole thing was.   And now for something completely different. Some people can take a little thing that was never going to work out anyway and make a huge issue out of it. I love them, however. They just need to forget about it and move onto something new. It was a good first try.

      I wonder if anyone reads this. Doesn't matter.  I had this long post all planned out but it just left me, so it's not happening.

      I uber-hate my life right now. Next Wednesday is going to be hell.  [edit] I think if someone put cyanide(sp?) in my soda right now I would be OK with it, but I'd never kill myself. Right now my GPA is 3.275 and parent-teacher conferences are next Wednesday. The GPA isn't  so  bad I guess....but it's the fact that I have C+'s in two classes. I have a feeling they  might  have gone up to B-'s but maybe not. Still, my mother is not going to be happy. My mother said if I got any C's at all my life would change drastically (meaning no Europe this summer)...even though it's only a quarter grade and I usually get A-'s and above at the semester. Wow, I'm just, stressed. I need more sleep and maybe some yoga or something.

      Not to toot my own horn, but I go to a lot of professionally designed websites and think "I could do that!" and it's true. I think I'm skilled in graphics. It's sad that I'm disgusted by my own designs and am forced to use a modified defaulted template. Oh well.

      The only word I could use to describe my life right now is blah. Actually, I could also use "messy". I have problems. I have poor grades, about 2.23, in two classes. I don't know how I can fix them. I tried really hard, and this is what I get. I don't understand. I rearranged my room and made it spotless Friday night. Saturday morning, my father must install a pipe under the kitchen floor (my ceiling) and now my room is a total mess. Sheetrock powder, moved storage units, torn up ceiling. The disorganization is causing my physical pain, in my head. And now I discover he has written his notes all over my PE homework.   Reading over the above paragraph I have come to the conclusion that I'm starting to become very indignant towards every little thing. I know he'll clean it up and yet I find myself glaring at him constantly! In other news, my new favorite food is Peace Cereal's Apple-Cinnamin Crisp. So good. Granola, oats, apples...yum. It's a little libral for me, though. They donate 10% of their profits to anti-Bush stuff. Anti-Bush people are quite silly. Especially those who support Kerry. Kerry  voted  for the war. He  voted  for collecting the 87 billion dollars to support the troops. These people claim to hate Bush because he is behind the war! It's like they don't know what they want! Kerry also seems a bit confused...he says things that he doesn't even know that he's saying! He just spits out statistics and expects votes. We'll see about that.  School tomorrow. But only a half day on Wednesday and next week a few days off and the week after that no school for spring break. I'm going to Southern California. Can't wait. School is killing me.

      Well, hello there! I haven't spoken to you in quite some time now. Let me recap:  My grades got fixed and I got a very high GPA, they are now suffering again, I have a major crush, im getting tired of the way I dress, I'm bored with life. In fact, I'm very bored with life right now. I almost wish something radical would happen just so I could have a little change. I want to not live out in the middle of nowhere where I can't do anything social. There is only one person from school who lives somewhat near me but we're not friends. I never get to go swimming with my friends, I never get to go shopping, I never get to go to movies. I feel like I want to blog more often and the little makeover has encouraged me. Tomorrow I shall be more bloggy and thoughtful.

       Because I'm an areku!poser and tredwhore, my recap post!     My Recap of the 2003/2004 School Year   It was a pretty good year. Not really academically, but socially and emotionally. I made a lot of new friends; including Areku, both Catherines, Anthony, Mika, Lindsay, and Joel. I also decided to stop acknowledging stereotypes and social "rules". For example, I got over that really immature thing umong students at my school where you can't listen to punk or pop or 80's music or else you're a loser or a fag. I now refuse to not listen to good music just because it's not "cool". I think Britney and Avril have a lot of talent. What else.... I'm more about myself around people. I decided that all those people that hate me because they're jealous already think I'm a fag, so why not confirm their suspiscions? Ha! I think I'm more of a fun person now and I'm no longer afraid of social situations.  My classes were: Monday/Friday: Science, 30 min advocacy, English, math, health/PE, 30min lunchSpanish, Art. Tuesday: Science, 10 min advocacy, English, math, 60min lunch, health/PE. Wednesday: Science, 10 min advocacy, English, Spanish, 60min lunch, art. Thursday: Math, 10 min advocacy, health/PE, Spanish, 60min lunch, art.  They were OK. I had one of the best science teachers ever first semester. She really made me interested in the lessons and helped me get a high grade. She left so she could live with her husband down on the Columbia River. Her replacement for the rest of the year was a man who did not go to any education schooling and did not have a teaching liscense. He was a crappy teacher and didn't give a damn about anything. He'd give us tests without letting us learn the chapters. I tried really hard and did all of the assignments and papers and I think he gave me a C+ because he didn't like the fact that I didn't look him in the eyes. He told me this upset him several times. I can't help it, I just can't take him seriously. He didn't come to work on Fridays. Our exam day was a Friday. The substitute agreed that the test was unreasonable and extreme and let us use our text books.  Advocacy was stupid, except for when we had student forums where we got to give our opinions on the student climate. I got really into it and was elected president because of my goals to boost morale and have more creative ideas for fundraisers and events. That should be fun.  My English teacher was nice. She was reasonable with the work she gave us and gave us fun projects to do. She also really liked my work and gave me high grades. One time she did make us read a book that I hated. She was really concerned because I wasn't doing very well on those test (I never read the chapters) and kept giving me weird glances. Other than that, I didn't have a problem with her because she was really sweet and had this great learning system. She believed that after 14 minutes of talking to us about a subject our minds "downshift" and she must switch to a different topic to keep us focused. It worked.  My math teacher was interesting. I guess I liked him. He didn't really have a personality. The whole year was just do our homework, review the homework, do more homework. Test. Repeat. He was cool.  I hate my health/PE teacher. She made us run in PE! (I know, *gasp*)... I guess I improved because before that PE class I couldn't run for 15 minutes without stopping but now I can. I also lost weight. But thank goodness I'm not taking a PE class next year!  My Spanish teacher was great. He really made me interested in the Spanish language (even though I think it's a really ugly language). I picked it up really well and I got more than 100% in the class, when the class average was a C-. I really liked it and I'm glad I have him again next year. He was really good because he let us work independantly a lot of the time and showed us movies in Spanish. We watched Stand and Deliver, Shrek, Sweet 15, Bend it like Beckham, Finding Nemo, Ice Age, and The Milagro Beanfield Miracle.  I guess it was a pretty good year. I really like the town I moved to because the people are really friendly and it's really clean and beautiful. My GPA for the year was probably only about a 3.5 average. That's pretty good, but 2-3 points less than last year. That's OK. I think I learned more this year.  I had 3 or 4 boyfriends this year. My personal record. I think I have also fallen in love. A couple other times I thought I had but now I don't think I really did. Now I just get this feeling everytime I see or even think about this person that makes me feel like I'm nothing without him and I'd do anything to just touch him. Sometimes just the thought of him makes me start to cry. Oh yeah, I've matured!  I now officially leave for the UK  TOMORROW !  *sigh*, love for all...

      Guess what. I'm like, home and stuff! The trip was ... fun I guess. I went to England, Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland ... Just so you know. I bought "Remixed & Revisited" by Madonna and I now officially own every Madonna CD.
