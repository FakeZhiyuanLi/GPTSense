      Hmmm....nice night isn't it? Well...last night was kinda' like a bit too much too especially with the excessive darkness located almost everywhere. And further more it was my birthday too~~! Glad the lights came on two hours after the blackout occured too~! =)  Speakin' of the blackout I thought that it was actually a brownout by one of Singapore's pathetic 'por kai' power plants on some crazy remote island like Pulau Senoko I think. But too bad it isn't....and it's those Indonesians' fault! Okay okay...enough of such nonsense ~~ it is too crazy to remember it ever!  About my big day, I forgot about it of course and didn't want to celebrate it~! Birthdays are such lame occasions, and I wonder if they should change it to waste-of-resources day as well. It's really a waste of resources buying a crazy and wasteful large cake to commemerate the event! I'd prefer that a birthday would be passed as a normal one, which shall happen in the near future I guess. And today...looks like Ang insulted my intelligence again~! Some of them must be in league with her against me I suppose so~! ((Maybe I think too much...'kopped' from M.J.))  I wonder if anyone found TV advertisements becoming lamer and cornier these days? And by the way, the Eye for a Girl may be coming soon but at least the bachelor is quite good-looking compared to the Eye for a Guy bachelorette who looks so haggard and horrible that she looks like an 'ah soh' in a swimming pool! (Check 8 days if you don't believe, and the issue was published a few weeks ago~=/)  Seems like I'm too lazy to add in any other language into this post today~~ and I hope to write somemore in future while attempting to juggle my heavy load of work alongside with play such as writin' blogs + written journals. Plannin' to write another story on FanFiction.net~~~but no one will know my pen name...WAHAHAHAHA! Okay, that's lame~! =P  Dropped at Boon Lay MRT station after the excursion, I went to 'shop shop' at Jurong Point, which totally sux~! Not many CD shops are located there, and only a few lousy stores have made their rental there too. Definitely not a place for shopping, except for findin' some anime like Gundam Seed which is a whooping lotsa' there! Plus Western Singaporeans seems more geared to C-pop, and less interested in the beautiful sounds of K-pop & J-pop....which is a pity to know that not many people likes J-pop there. And I broke the law ;)! Eating food on the MRT is so kinda' dangerous that it can even slap you with a five hundred dollar fine, which is so kinda' stupid too~! Nevertheless, I ate, therefore I am. ((Copied le quote from a friend~~))  Too much saliva has been spit out that it's time to end. (K.G. will suffer if she could not withstand la Saliva Batterie Grande de le Alvin!) It's time to conclude, bye!

      Wahahahaha.....it's me again~~!! Wait a minute...this is my bloggie...so shouldn't it be me? LAME~~~...what a bitch I've been~!! =P  That Ng Hui is REALLY gettin' on my nerves~!! She's been appearing in everything on TV, even joining Ivy Lee in some crazy slimming advertisement where all the crazy men just go after Ivy Lee and she closing the slimming centre door on them. I hope Ng Hui's turn won't do the same or else I'm gonna' bring a rifle to Mediacorp~! =) =) =)  Hmmm...speakin' of yesterday I've been showing my friend the picture of Mutya's ugly piercing. ((It's a piercing~! Her name's Mutya! WAHAHAHAHAH! I dunnoe why I find Mutya Buena of Sugababes so funny especially in Hole in the Head & Round Round which makes me super tickled~!! [And they will go on as 'What's so funny?'])) Okay, enough it's super-lame~! I doubt anyone can understand it.  Sob sob~!! Holiday's coming to a close~!!! But...there's a but there...((following Miss Poon of 2000)) I found one way to insult girls indirectly! Note this word 'Ladies of Virtue', but it means 'Prostitutes' in fact. It's so fun to call girls this kind when they say thank you in response! =D  Whoooooo.....I'm writin' this long and not a single word of la Lingua Japonaise? Mmmm...this is so un-FRENCH~! And I wonder how many bonnets will I laugh at this time? Le French Kolina est la Frenchman et le Rendezvous et le Depot. By the way, 'depot' is pronounced in English as 'depo', not 'depot'! 'Debut' is pronounced as 'debyu', and not 'de-but!'!   わたしは今日Ｙａｈｏｏ！チャットを入ますよ！チャット人々はレムでございますよ！人がへんたいで、目的は日本女の子を出逢うことでございます。そして、いまは終わりですよ。休みよ！左様奈良！

      Okay, what shall I talk about today? Oh yes....I'm so irritated by the number of 'I's that look like small 'L's! And I only hope that I won't have to succumb to writing such a form of 'I'! It is so irritating too!!  And like my friend kept complaining to me, Ng Hui is appearing too many times on TV and now I kinda' have some adversity towards her. 但是，她的确在电视上appear太多次了！这事也烦死我呀！黄慧应该不要在电视上出现太多次的！Hmm...why am I ending all sentences with exclamation marks? Seems like I'm getting too 哈日了！Okay, enough of Chinese influence in this blog entry...it's gettin' out of hand~!~!! =/  じゃ…これは日本語のＳｅｃｔｉｏｎです。未来には日本をいきたいよ！私は来年日本をいって、楽しい旅を感じました！東京市が美しで、アジアの一番楽しい市でございます。これから、今の日は２００４年６月２３日です。日も平成１６年をあり、じつはその年はＩｎａｃｃｕｒａｔｅです。君は私の日本語が一番事と思いなら、事がまたティンクーしてください！僕の日本語はへたで、Ｉｎａｃｃｕｒａｔｅだけど。じゃ…日本語で使うながら多いＲｕｂｂｉｓｈをいいますよ！そして、つづく！  That was a complete load of rubbish in there. And my Japanese was superb, superbly horrid~! It's kinda' terrible when you're unable to write proper Japanese especially when not understanding its grammar properly. Hmm...but any readers should be able to laugh at it too~! =)  Okay, I've got to end this post now! Bye for now! サー！まった次の度だよ！

      今日は素敵な土曜日か？いまガンダームアニメOSTを聞いてございます。じゃ...コンピューターをrepairと思います。いまアニメ歌をuploadして、そのうたはrareのからな。そして、この日記の読み者はこの日本語を読めませんな~~！=P  Okay, enough of some Japanese text. I guess no one will be able to read it probably too. Hmm....what else can I say? Another boring day with severe PMS in the morning which continued until the afternoon where it was at its peak. Gonna' wipe out my computer soon due to some errors within it~~=P  All I just want to wish is that everything will go smoothly and it's best to upload my rare mp3 onto a backup system before anything bad happens. Especially one good song is the full version of the Charmed Theme Song =O  Okay, enough of my rubbish~~~!! Time to end, bye! まった明日！

      Hmmm...trouble week indeed~! My computer's memory broke down and PW demand is getting heavier by the weeks. Well...at least no one's hearin' what I have to say...=P  Now hearing TATU's All The Things She Said...imagining Chooedwinnie and Kolina as the two girls in the MV...which makes Kenneth puke too...hahahaha~~!!  いま日本語を話します。この日記も日本語でタイープするが、こともいいそしています。君は日本語を分かれば、この日記も読めます。分かりますか？最近コンピューターが悪しで、ことは我慢ですね？漢字を書くことがかもしれますよ。しかし、日本語を書くことはむずかしいね。  Okay, time to end some Japanese crap within. Looks like I gonna' evaluate some PW work before I log off~~~bye!

      Forgot to cut my fingernails again.  How many times have I told myself?  My dear Alvin, could you please kindly cut your nails as soon as possible?  *Sigh* But actually, I feel like a witch with long fingernails with the power to have black magical energy contained within me, and with the ability to cast curses etc. Maybe I'm a witch~~=/  PW is so troublesome...especially when blunders have been made...with the wrong date specified etc. And it is none other than a period where you can learn to fake results, and eventually fake your written report as well. (I learned to fake my survey results too...kinda' a greenhorn at such skills of deception~~! =/)  Haiyo! See  lah ! I've already sidetracked from my blog entry proper to some rubbish written above. What was I supposed to say earlier on? Oh yes...while sitting somewhere to expel the shit from my system or better known as egestion in biological terms, I was reminded of the crazy moments in first 3 months SRJC of 2004...especially when the first intake were rather nice too...with the retainees very friendly to us intakees as well.   On a beautiful Thursday morning, all the classes had gathered at the parade ground, from 1A01 to 1A07,&nbsp;and from&nbsp;1S01 to 1S24, preparing to be led by their CT away to their new classes. But alas! The tutors had told us to attend our venue of first tutorial/lecuture by ourselves which caused a great furore amongst us. It was kinda' funny too 'cause we weren't very used to the new system of self-initiation, which is to be used to the system whereby our secondary school teacher would bring us back to our classrooms shortly after morning assembly or silent reading period there.     &nbsp; Quite nostalgic, ain't it? It was quite a boring and lame joke...but the feeling was there if you had been a 1st intake SRJC student. At the moment, SRJC is filled with weirder people who do not have the warmth of the intakees. (Most of us either fled to TJ, CJ, TPJ&nbsp;or VJ etc. I was an exception....flew off to YJ instead of entering 'proper' JCs meant for my kind of character.)   Okay, enough of such rubbish already. Let's simply hope for the best in the future...while I miss my SRJC friends who are mostly in TPJ at the current moment. T_T~!

      Today was a somewhat crazy day.  A kinda' boring day as we spent our time under stress at the Economics tutorial in which we made to be under a limited time to complete essays...approximately 45 minutes or so. Furthermore, the other class was so damn noisy that I couldn't really concentrate and had to stop short in my tracks whenever I wanted to resume my essay...*sigh*...enough of such thing already~~perhaps it ain't a good time to talk about it~~ -_-  Another problem that is currently pending would be Project Work. It is so kinda' difficult to coordinate, in my opinion, that we had to probably create some disputes while in the progress of it too. Never mind...and I guessed I would delay my Constitution's effect until end of this week due to the badly done draft, which requires editing again. A strict one that would allow a better student to awaken within me.  Why do I sound like someone in my class? Oh no~~~I mustn't change personality again...especially after secondary school where the major change from extreme introvertism to moderate introvertism is there. What else can I say about today? Looks like there is nothing much...and it's way past midnight too...one past midnight with a strong urgency to sleep now.   I must do some work tomorrow...and TUITION tomorrow....what a terrible day!

      WOW! I haven't written a single entry in THIRTEEN DAYS~! This is so cool, given the special number~~! =P Anyway, the past few weeks have been full of corniness...especially with me sufferin' from PMS sometimes. [Yes! Some boys do get them, ya know?]  Hmmm....what's today main focus of the entry? Oh yes I got it! My agenda: To write down...er....nothing? Never mind...my mind's going crazy~~! =/ Maybe I should write some horrible facts about my CTG girls....hahaha~~!! Let's see...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goh KG ~ The oldest of the group...so is the grandma of the class lor~~! Nothing to say &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about her...just only her lame quotes like 'Tell me a joke.' Rumored to be in 'les'&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with MJ, but believed to have been dumped 'cause latter wants to be straight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peh MJ ~ Probably the most dominant of the group...not a good sign. Maybe just like Lina&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo from GYMS, now in SRJC. Too outspoken and sometimes want to flaunt off&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her English but can't do it 'cause she she she she can't do it. And and and and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always look like like like she want to sue ya'. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sila ~ Yay! One of my few trusted allies in YJC! Also speaks in the anti-MJ league~! But &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since she's my ally...I can't say much about her  lor !  Wah....too many girls to write....and so hard to edit.  Haiz!  Maybe this would be better should I write in my handwritten diary instead. [ Muscle power is so much better.... ] Hmmm....there's plans to write a Constitution to guide the pupil Alvin Tan of CTG 125 who looks like a bloody nerd similar to the Andrew in his history class. Somemore, he wants to be the next Mr. Loke...who is so damn sickening too.  Kiam pah bo?  Oh yes, his face's one  kiam pah  type too!   Hmmm....what should I say more about Alvin Tan? And ya lor...his name is so damn irritating...with the TAN in it of course. Instead...we can call him Alvin Tan Wang Ba Dan...suitz his name too instead of that girly name of Jing Ren who sounds like sissy who behaves like some whore back in his heyday. [Whoever can go wallop him for me secretly...I'll sponser  de ~~]   HEY! Why am I insulting myself? WOW....I can insult myself so well??? I LOVE this kind of hatemail....wonder when will they make an Alvin Tan hatelisting in future? Oops...I mean the stupid Alvin Tan who couldn't even make it to a good institute of learning...especially going to pathetic schools like SSS....triple asses. [Serangoon Seconday School]   Okok.....this is getting into a madcap....time to end up here~~~BYE &amp; See YA!~~~!!!

      Comin' to think of the above date of entry, I was wondering about this entry 'In the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety-two'. It seems so long ago when you read about such diary entries too. Anyway, that date was the year when Christopher Columbus left Seville port in Spain for the Carribean which he deemed it to be Asia intially.   What was I supposed to say anyway? Oh yes, I had been very bad at speaking other languages actually. Like for example, you are not supposed to call Octobre as 'Oct-to-breh' but simply call it as it was pronounced in English. And the word depot is not supposed to be called 'de-port', but simply as 'dere-poh'. Believe it or not, it is true. (Too much French influence infused into le Language I guess.) And 'le' is used as an emphasis in American English, with courtesy of UrbanDictionary of course! So this is le diary de le me le et cetera. But it's not uncommon 'cause I've been using it for ages to irritate many friends so that they will say 'ENOUGH OF DIE FRENCH CULTURZ'! Yap..it's made to sound German with all the crazy Zs at the back of le some words.  Never mind...it's so lame. And I guess no one will ever understand my jokes unless the person is usually English-educated and has a wide knowledge of Hollywood gossip. (Mmmmm!) Paris Hilton is also stupid too, with her blond hair, and her smarter companion of Nicole Ritchie. [She smears the name of Lionel Ritchie, and Paris smears the great Hilton empire with The Simple Life.] And I can't really accept that Kathy Hilton is gonna' make a new drama called The Good Life but it's kinda' nice to watch 'cause rich upperclass ladies can be seen bitching each other around too.  In Deo Nos Credamus! The original motto of the United States in Latin. But look at the country, are they really trusting God these days? Are they fearing God these days? And for those who suck at Latin, the Latin motto means 'In God We Trust'. And for those Latin experts, I use 'nos' to emphasize le motto. If not it will be known as In Deo Credamus, which is definitely not emphasized at all! Lingua Latina lingua bonam est! Go find out for yourself if you have no crazy idea what the above sentence Latin means!   Okay, cannon saliva I am! How about rest some? Now, goodbye!

      Eleven o'clock, night, a hour more to the Ninth Day of the Seventh Month of the Two Thousand and Fourth Year of the Common Era. Perhaps less than an hour maybe. Being doin' nothing for the past three hours, with simply dilly and dally by my side.  I wonder what surprises awaits me tomorrow? Is it just a normal day, a horrid one or one that would be happily unforgettable? Or one that would made me behave in a pussilaneous way? Life is short, so is peace. All the more we should not delay what we deem to do right to the next morning.  Hahahaha....that was so damn philosophical rite? It's so crazy to write in such Shakespearan way. ((But I like 1500s to 1600s England anyway~~)) Thinking back of the history syllabus taken at the A levels, it is clear that this is not the kind of history that I can put my best effort in. The best history would be to study Europe's history beginning from 1453 to 1972. And by the way, the year 1453 is the fall of the last Roman empire or better known as the Byzantine Empire. That's when the fairly modern history of Europe started.  My computer's jammin' up and I have no idea what is causing such a thing. It's either the virus within this computer or the Overnet downloader that I'm using. One thing I would like to use on the computer is to simply take a hammer and slam it down onto my motherboard so that it will 'contain' the problem instantly. But, this is kinda' stupid so I would not do such a crazy and impractical way to solve problems.   Strange...why am I writin' such non-sensical stuff today? Perhaps...the 'whore' element in me is rising up and 'causing Mr Alvin Tan to change into a whore + slut. Okok...maybe I'm thinkin too much. [Quote with courtesy of Miss MJ from YJC.]  Well...what was I supposed to write about then? Hmmm....typed several stupid quizzes given by mu-ryou friends in friendster...which is kinda' corny too. And I wonder why people do not write long blogs too....shouldn't these cyber stuff be rather lengthy too? Good example --> http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/; and I'm so surprised that there are so many people called Alvin Tan...especially of all shape & sizes too.....with courtesy of Google of course, and not forgetting Yahoo! as well.  Okay...too much body fluid is flying out of the giant opening located at the front of my head. It's time to say goodbye....GOODBYE FOR NOW! Wishing myself all the best in the upcoming History Quiz for tommorow~~!!!

Hmmm....PW stress gettin' higher and higher...with surveys to do...and I have to go back to my school to interview?!? *Sigh* I just do hope the DM will accept me...or else I'll face the consequences again. Wednesday...a rather relaxing day but with time to waste as well. ((Well...I'm currently doin' my tutorials and it ain't gettin' anywhere....!!!))  Haven't written an entry on fanfiction.net for a rather long time; should begin to write a new chapter as soon as all of these mess is cleared up. =/ And tomorrow's a long day as well...with MATHS again as the last tutorial which is so damn boring too! Lookin' at the GundamSeed OST makes me feel.....nothing??? Hahaha...that joke was GAY~! ((Nvm...I'm a student of gayness. [Koped from KG Goh] =P ))  難しい…難しい…明日が、だからタスックが必ず続きますよ…クタバレな！明日の中国語レッソンじゃないことがいいで、大丈夫になります！イマのミュシックが玉置奈実の“ＲＥＡＬＩＺＥ”歌で、歌がいいですな！だけど、ミューシックを永遠に聞くことが真実にじゃないよ。島谷ひとみの新しい“ＤＥＬＩＣＩＯＵＳ”アルバムがほしい、アルバムがちょっと安くなかったそうだけど。そして、浜崎あゆみの最新な“ＩＮＳＰＩＲＥ”シンガーもほしい、今月２７日になって出発します。  *Sigh* Demo...homuwookuu ga arukara, atarashii CDs wo kain-masenyo. Okay...looks like it's time to wrap up for tonight. It's been a long day too. Okay then...tata~~! =]

      What to do at a time like this? Much work to be done...and everything's need to be settled as well~~! And further more Miss Ang was so damn BITCHY during the Chinese lesson with her kp here kp there. ((Oh never mind...most JC teachers are bitchy..especially Econs tutor-bitch Miss Aminah~~! =/)) Wahaha...I'm so bad...being such a person of sarcasm too~~~!!  So much maths to do....who cares about it? It's just some A level subject that you need to pass so that many doors of university of courses will open to you upon passing this subject but it's so darn difficult too! I rather summon a golden key to open all doors to university courses and pick the one I like the best. ((Wonder why there isn't really a history course in university? Seems like similar courses only exists overseas such as being a curator at London Museum??? =O ))  And suda~~~~so much work to be done...especially Chinese AO.....and I don't wanna drop until I'm dead. That's my key idea to maintaining four A levels subjects, and I WILL score for all of them~~~!! Plus it can prove all the teachers' bad opinion about me!!! *Sigh* I miss my SRJC era friends + tutors...they are so nice~~~~compared to the tutors here where most are merciless etc. ((Even my Chinese tutor's better than Miss Ang~~! Although she did looked a bit odd...))   Never mind...what's done cannot be undone. Perhaps the only thing I can look forward to is to just study and study...BUT I HAVE NO CCA~~!!!! *Sob Sob* Maybe I won't go to university after all with no CCA....and looks like Meijiao's giving the I-want-to-sue-you look again at me when I told her I wanted to try out the Biology club. Plus she gave out the Join-the-bio-club-with-me-over-my-dead-body look as well. I wonder how does she give such looks that makes her super 'kiam-pah'. Never mind about that Lina no.2....I can't be bothered with such people who likes to biased against others.  The time now? 12.23 am....ticking away on Wednesday 7 July CE 2004. ((Why don't I use Anno Domino? 'Cause it's unfair to non-Christians though my entry title has Christian and medieval influence in  it. Hey! I'm beginnin' to sound like Ownself-answer-questions Mr. Leong Choon Fatt! This is so shocking~~~!!))  Okay...enough of my bitching plus slutty entry. Time to get going on my Chinese assignment...AU~~ REVOIR~~~!!!! (I'm so FRENCH now!) ((Plus the bonnets & tea as well!))

      Haiyo....had too many naps these days. ((What on earth is my body doing? Is it becomin' la defiante?)) Enjoyed my day goin' to Tampines laughing at Sugababes' Three album at Sembawang + going on a shopping spree there with food to "ta b'ao" back from there. =P  I've no idea what kind of show Gundam Seed is but the music's darn good! No wonder T.M.Revolution really deserves such credit for producing the anime theme songs for science fiction genre anime series. Perhaps I should start scouting for the Ending Theme of Fruits Basket 'cause it's damm great too~~! =)  *Sigh* I have not written a fanfiction.net installment for a week already. ホームウォークはもっとむずいよ。これはおかしくなかったそしています！いまきいている歌は玉置奈実さんの「Ｒｅａｌｉｚｅ」でございますね。Ｎｅｖｅｒｍｉｎｄですが、ホームウォーク絶対完了しますから！「“準備完了”この字がすきですよ！＝）」そして、いまラティんその語を学び、ホームウォークもつきますながらよ！物語の分をまだ書き無い、書くときが絶対探しますけど。ホームウォークをまだまだ書き無い、しかし事にするときは必ず探しします！じゃ…日本語がへただよ！そして、いまはつづく！＝Ｐ  Phew...kinda' tiring. I should read more Japanese linguistics during my free time rather than to do other rubbish. But in the case of learning Latin, I suppose it shouldn't take up too much time. =) Hmmm...seems like my project work's ain't going anywhere these days too. Much conflict, combined with some who can't find time to meet, is gonna' destroy the group I suppose, with me of course ousted the first. And some class members seem to have a vendetta against me, with an objective to 'sue' me or something like that. Looks like the classroom scene is gettin' too political too with people definitely developing wondrous biases against each other by this time. ((Wah...I'm sounding like some person in the National Convention during the French Revolution radical phase. But if I were a politician, the best place for me would be in the moderate royalists 'cause I'm always advocating constitutional monarchy for the best government!) I wonder if schools in Singapore should adopt the American style of constitution. Judging from yesterday's Simpsons, I suppose the student council in almost every school there will have to write a Constitution before they can do anything about their role in school. =P  Okay, I'm becoming a saliva centre for anyone who is saliva-less~! Got ta' go, see ya! 待ったあしたか二つ日あとで…さようなら！

      Really a sour day today~~quite terrible too, especially with M.J. always givin' the I-want-to-sue-you-for-slandering-me look at people she probably dislikes. *Sigh* Looks like I'm gonna' write some criticism about myself in the PW independent learning W/S 'cause I just feel like it. I guess I won't want my PW efforts recognised, or it would be devastating to me to share the credit earned within the group which will make me a free-loader in actual fact.  Maths Common Test comin' up soon....but I really am not bothered to study for it. Perhaps studying and practising on a few tutorials may help, but I guess it's not goin' to work too! It is a good thing that Functions is not involved in the Test, otherwise I'd really be dead meat! (Functions is so darn difficult!) And there's a Youth Day celebration tomorrow which I may consider 'ponning' it for the sake of my work.   Suda...I still much work to complete but I'm not too stressed out yet~! I don't really feel the stress of 4As pressing down on me. In fact, doing Economics, Physics and History are quite enjoyable too. I'm in a happy mood when doin' History tutorials, in a somewhat enthusiastic morale to do Economics essays, and a rather "so-so" feeling when completing Physics tutorial~! ;)   I was just wonderin' if there was a way to actually acquire pure nerd-ism in life. I don't think there is such thing as a pure nerd....like for example Andrew from the history class is only probably about eighty...seven percent nerd, and I'm kind of like seventy...nine percent nerd too. I guess pure nerds are hard to find but it's like nirvana if sub-nerds learn to acquire such a status where they are so smart that they can beat anyone in knowledge. 真令人佩服！  Hmmm...here's how to irritate some people by actin' as sissies. Some very irritating sissy quotes are like 'So Bad~~~!', '讨厌~~', 'Aiyah...don't be like that~~~' and 'So bitchy only~!' etc. It's kinda' weird but I like to use them to irritate my relatives. Especially with the first quote which is a super strong word that irritates even the most calm people, unless the calm ones like to use it too.   I guess I've become another saliva reservoir this time. (Looks like K.G. ain't gonna' forgive me for becomin' a saliva cannon on her. History has repeated itself...especially for poor Y.L. from SRJC first 3 months~~!) =P Au Revoir~! さようならございます！

      Whee....the National Fervour is gone.  Look. Four days gone in a simple breeze. It really tells that time really flies, or perhaps fly faster than the speed of light I guess. But we couldn't prove that according to scientific method I guess, perhaps in the artistic mind I suppose? It can also tell us that life is really short...with perhaps a quick test of life on earth?  I was wonderin' the other day on why do other people write such minuscule blog entries? It seems rather stupid to me that most would write such blogs of puny and pathetic content. If you have nothing to write, then don't write at all! That is one of my main motto in my constitution, which definitely restricts personal freedom and permits the powerful result as a strict regulated student.  But looks like I've left out the 1A07 Gossip Club. I suppose the strict regulations of the constitution should have nothing to do with it lest it would cause me to lose one of my most favourite pastimes. Besides, the world can never go round without gossip. In a nutshell, humans need gossip to alleviate any boredom that awaits them. Even people back in the stone age were gossiping on which caveman to marry as well. And speaking of cavemen, there are quite a number of them at Yishun where they buy a big chicken drumstic and start using their teeth to gnaw at it. It is so uncivilised to have such actions done for it destroys the mere meaning of civilisation. We are humans, not animals!  Okok...looks like my bitchiness level was getting too high. Whenever you feel bitchy, you'll always feel like bitching around, and when you bitch around, you tend to get lame and corny as well that you will not produce corn but instead develop corns on your feet. Hmmm...shouldn't be too 'xiaxue' already!  Hikaru Utada's songs are so nice to hear, especially Can You Keep A Secret & Traveling. (Yes, it's spelt this way. Even her English is not perfect and no Japanese has bothered to correct her 'cause their English is worser than her American-born one and that anything English is very high-class in Japan whereas we Singaporeans think that it kinda' sux 'cause we've been learning since we were small toddlers!) But, I'd prefer to hear her songs 'cause they are so nice and she writes her own songs as well! =)  Thinking about Singlish, I wonder how do foreigners learn it? It must be difficult to learn it if you're not a native of Singapore or if you have not stayed in Singapore before. Like for example, when do you know how to use  lah  or when do you know how to use  lor ? It is really difficult for the foreigner to communicate in Singlish. Who knows? It could be a National Language of Singapore someday when the Singaporean society has integrated so much that we discard our four original languages.  Okok....I guess too much is too much. I have to retire to the night now.  A very wonderful night!

      Enjoyed myself last night at the Esplanade: Theatres by the Bay.  It was so damn crowded last night, and I have no idea how crowded could I describe it. Perhaps crowded enough to convert a plant-like me into a strong diamond-like me texture. There was also a group of boys whom were so absolutely SMELLY...and I couldn't take it! Nearly choked & suffered from asphxia in the train due south to City Hall station. Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself at the Esplanade with my friends...quite an interesting day.  Hehe...we were nearly driven out of the 5566 concert since we left of our own accord. Now I understand why concerts should not have free admission; it'll cause a mob to form and big enough to form the  sans-culottes  of 1789. (Yes...the French again~! O_O La Diana est la Francaise!)  Enjoying myself on Friendster again...with that irritating smiley face which should be replaced with a sad face known as Foester instead. In this way, we can enjoy BITCHING better right? Imagine so many people bitching around by writing bitchy testimonials, which makes it similar to a virtual version of Mean Girls. SO BITCHY of me~~~=D [Hehe...I sound like some slut~~]  Friends is so funny....especially this episode where they learn French. I'm not amazed that Matt LeBlanc can be so expressive in French...he's a French-American, noting the 'Le' in his surname~~=) [He's quite hot too...! But I ain't gay!] Hmmm...why am I side-tracking...kinda' lame of me to write further good points about Friends.  Back to the main topic, the fireworks were kinda' great but too short. We need more to suit ourselves to the Live Firing Area comin' up in less than 2 years' time! But I loved those cauliflowers exploding across the maroon backdrop of the Singapore nightsky, with the city skyline in the background. Perfect picture to take photo! But oops! Did Singapore ever had an impressive skyline? The only skylines which I would deem to be beautiful would be that of New York's and Tokyo's which are so damn beautiful that you would say 'Wow!' and 'Sugoi ne!' in the Big Apple and at the centre of the Japanese Kanto plain respectively.  Okok....looks like I've been spitting too much saliva out in this site. Better remember Yoke-ling's request to lessen my saliva. And I'm kinda' impressed she really went for a makeover with her permed hair removed and contacts put on. Okok...enough of my rubbish...time to go...see ya!

       "The first three months of JC were much better than any other period of JC life." How far do you agree on this statement?     Hehehe...I wonder if the above could be a GP essay, but it would be unfair to those who didn't manage to enter JC during the first three months. Nevertheless, I still wish for such an essay question to emerge so that I can write my best experience of it. Hence, our topic for today would be on the first three months.  Perhaps not many people would miss their first three months at JC, but I do. It was one of the rare eras where I could belong to a group of friends and yet be not neglected too. I have a bunch of acknowledgements I would like to thank for making my first three months enjoyable, and tolerable. This would be put down later on.  Most people in the first three months would have frequent thoughts of withdrawing so that they could enjoy themselves since they had already made plans to enter polytechnic as soon as the O Levels results were out. However, such thoughts never did once crossed my mind. Really. Either I was too absorbed with my socialising, or that I had already planned a route for me to enter another JC later on to continue the syllabus.  The truth is, my friends at SRJC first three months 2004 were one of the rarest ones you could find. Unfortunately, we split up as soon as the period was over, which was some headed to polytechnics while others headed to different JCs each. Perhaps some chose to enter the same JC, but I didn't. And it was such a disappointment that I didn't join two friends who would otherwise be closer to me if I did enter that certain JC.  Many people would be thinking that I'm simply sulking away in YJC due to my 'inability' to socialise there. However, not many seems willing to socialise, and prejudice is rampant in that college. If I had a chance, I would like a time machine to bring me back to 2 January 2004, where I could play my SRJC orientation 2004 again, and enjoy the campfire that the student council had planned for us on the last day of orientation before we headed to lectures and tutorials the next day.  Perhaps I'm a little too overboard...maybe it would be better if I had stopped gloating over such trivial matters. Let me write down some acknowledgements:  Edwin Choo -- Yes! This friend whom I made instantly within a few days, with a rather close friendship as well despite us being put into different tutorial groups after the orientation. During the first few days, I couldn't believe that he would be in this JC 'cause a link had told me that he was supposed to enter NYJC and not SRJC. Nevertheless, I took the chance to made him a friend and success ensued after that. He is now currently in TPJC, and we still do go on outings during the holidays.  Sing Yee -- Another good friend as well. I just do hope that her 'war' with Edwin had ended too. She was also one close friend from SRJC, and was introduced to me through Edwin as well. Initially, I had thought that she was simply sarcastic but her true nature showed later and proved to be a great friend for all too. ((Why do I sound like I'm writing a Friendster testimonial??)) Anyway, this TKGS student has went on to TPJC too, and I'm still apologetic for not agreeing to go to TPJC with her and Edwin when she had recommended me to. =(  Jean -- Oh! The Jurong girl...hehehe...came from Fuhua and surprisingly made it to SRJC so far in the north east. This meant that she nearly had to go across the entire island to meet us at SRJC, but I supposed her close friendship with us also made her tolerate the temptation to withdraw since the travelling distance was super great. And she was also everyone's  best friend , and I stress these words 'cause the way she pronounced were rather of nice meaning. It's agreeable that she's now in JJC, judging from the proximity of her home.  Ying Wen --  You, go away~!  These were the words she blurted out when she had lost her five dollars. Of course, this was not intentional but more of humour. I still bring up this matter when all of us met, and this resulted in laughter. I've got to know her after managing to know much of the class of 1A07 as I continued my frequent socialising with them. And to think I used to call her the brown girl due to her uniform, which resembles NYJC's. Currently in polytechnic, I guess all of us will only meet during the next school break.  Pei Ru -- One of the members whom I managed to know more after the June outing. I was rather surprised that she didn't choose to enter TJC, judging from her score of eleven points. Anyway, I managed to talk to her during the first three months too, since I'd always joined the 1A07 eating corner every break, or free period. I guess she must be studying away in NYJC, and one of the latest which my handphone managed to connect to.   I guess I'll write again soon. As for now, I'll publish these acknowledgements for perhaps them to read.   I still miss my first three months friends.
