      Hardware Video (QuickTime files)    urlLink PREVIEW     Dual Screens:   Two LCD screens offer one of the most groundbreaking game-play advances ever  developed: experiencing a game from two perspectives at once. Imagine the  possibilities. In a racing game, drivers might see their own vehicle's  perspective on one screen and an overall track view on the other. In a  role-playing game, the action could take place on the first screen while the  second provides a reference for a player's tools inventory. Game play also  could use both screens at once, offering a giant boss for heroes to defeat.  In the future, games could be created allowing users to play games on one  screen while text messaging other DS users on the other. Each 3-inch screen  can reproduce a true 3-D view and is backlit to assure comfortable play in  any lighting condition.    Touch Screen:    The lower screen will offer something never before provided by any game device:  PDA-like touch capabilities. Players no longer have to rely on just buttons  to move characters or shift perspectives. They can navigate menus or access  inventory items simply by touching the screen with stylus or fingertip. A  software-based keyboard might even allow the screen to be used as an input  center for games and messaging. The possibilities are limited only by  developers' imaginations. The screen will have a tougher film cover for  durability, and will come with a stylus.   Microphone:   An available microphone port means that in the future, players might need only to tell  their games what to do. DS software could identify everything from voice  commands to hand-clapping. Players might be able to move their characters  simply by telling them which way to go. The voice capabilities also could  allow gamers to chat with one another over the Internet while playing.   Wireless:   DS users will be able to connect with a local wireless network of up to 16 players.  Nintendo's guaranteed range is 30 feet, but will extend far beyond that  depending on circumstances. It assures high response rates required for real  time game play, and will make use of both IEEE 802.11 and Nintendo's  proprietary communication protocol, which provides low battery consumption.  Players will be able to chat and play games without any connecting cords,  completely untethered. The DS technology also provides for a wireless LAN  connection, which could allow a theoretically infinite number of players to  connect at a hot spot and compete at a central game hub on the Internet,  even if they're thousands of miles apart.    Wireless Game Sharing:    If software developers desire, multiple players can compete in wireless games,  even if only one person has a game card inserted. Players could also  test-play games for themselves as long as they stayed connected.   3-D:    With the newly developed graphics engine, DS can reproduce impressive 3-D renderings that  can surpass images displayed on the Nintendo® 64. Games will run at 60  frames per second, and allow details like fog effects and cel shading.   Sound:   The 16-channel sound  allows for greatly expanded use of voices and music, and a richer, more  immersive game experience. A plug for headphones transmits stereo sound.   Battery & Power Management:    The battery is rechargeable and the unit features a low-energy-consumption  design. The DS also has Power Management functions of Sleep mode and Standby  mode. In Sleep mode, players can stop and resume game play whenever they  like. If the user receives a message from a friend or user nearby, DS  activates itself from Standby mode.    Processing:   The unit will  run on two processors, one ARM9 one ARM7.   New Media:   For its compact  cards, the unit uses newly developed semiconductor memory, which allows for  lower cost, shorter manufacturing time and memory capacity of more than one  gigabit of information.    Dual Slots:   Nintendo DS  makes a vast library of Game Boy® Advance games readily available.  Developers could find ways to make new connections between GBA games and DS  games. The GBA port could be used for new hardware, enormously expanding the  functional expandability of the DS.

       With its two screens, Nintendo DS instantly shows its innovative face. But capabilities like a touch-screen input, voice recognition and wireless communication set it apart from every other game device, and again demonstrate Nintendo’s passion for groundbreaking originality.  Game players need only use their imagination to see how the DS promises to transform the portable game industry by changing the way gamers relate to their games – and each other. Two screens offer two perspectives on the action at once. The touch screen could make accessing items, moving characters or navigating menus as easy as a tap or drag on the screen. Voice recognition could let players simply tell the game what they want it to do. Chat software will let users transmit text messages, handwriting and even drawings to one another.   And wireless functions could link players in the same room – or across the country. The unique features of the Nintendo DS hold a wellspring of potential for the future. Game players will be wowed.

      The code name of the new portable Nintendo DS refers not only to its dual screens, but also to the fact that it’s a true developers’ system. When Nintendo made the rounds to the world’s biggest developers to showcase the potential of Nintendo DS, eyes lit up and smiles broke out. One group of engineers was even said to drool a little. Better than anyone, developers know that Nintendo DS represents a true shift in the portable experience. They don’t see just two screens and a list of features – they imagine what those features can do to make game play more exciting, more personal and more social. But let’s let them speak for themselves:   “When Nintendo came down and presented the DS platform to us, … I think everyone was in shock. It was amazing. … Our technical and central technology guys were kind of drooling at the abilities and wanting so much to program and dive into programming for the system. … Nintendo DS, I believe, is a revolution in change for hand-held gaming.” – Will Kassoy, vice president, global brand management, Activision    “I believe that Square Enix has a promising chance in the platform, since Nintendo DS allows users to experience whole new game play with both its input system and its output system.” – Yoichi Wada, president and representative director, Square Enix    “The Nintendo dual screen is something that we’re really excited about developing for. It’s very innovative, which is classic Nintendo.” – Nick Earl, vice president and general manager, Electronic Arts    “The fact that touch panels can be associated with many terms about touching that we never had, such as touch, push, feel, rub, slide and pat is wonderful. … I have been working in this industry for 20 years. During that time I made many games. But I think this is the first time that we have a new input device.” – Yuji Naka, senior corporate officer, development division, Sega     “Once again Nintendo is taking another leap in the gaming experience for the gamer by providing totally new game-play experiences, developing new gaming habits. Very characteristic of a Nintendo maneuver.” – Jay Cohen, vice president, publishing, Ubisoft     Nintendo DS is “a new game machine that will build the future of the game industry. … Our frontier spirit has been awoken.” – Tsunekazu Ishihara, chairman and CEO, Pokémon    “This has a huge potential. … It is very nice that we can create games using DS that were not even possible before.” – Yoichi Haraguchi, vice president and executive officer, Namco    “Nintendo has a reputation for doing extraordinary things in the hand-held space. The DS is an extraordinary device, and we are going to do everything in our power to support it.” – Michael Pole, executive vice president, worldwide studios, Vivendi Universal Games    “Nintendo DS is going to push the hand-held technology to really uncharted territories. By that I mean that it’s going to bring amazing new game mechanics, new game design.” – Yves Blehaut, senior vice president, Atari    “I think the DS will stimulate the process of game development.” – Tomofumi Gotsubo, president and CEO, Konami of America    “DS is deceptively amazing. … Touch screen is a very blank canvas for a game designer to be able to design their own input features. … DS really could be a killer to PSP. … I really think the Nintendo DS could kick the crap out of Sony PSP.” – Kevin Ray, chief technology officer, Majesco    “The wireless capability potentially allows game players to connect wirelessly literally around the world.” – Brian Farrell, president and CEO, THQ    “I am sure people have nice memory of yelling at a controller. Now, we have a more established function of inputting our voice. … Nintendo always pleasantly surprises us with interesting projects and interesting ideas.” – Keiji Inafune, producer, Capcom
