      yes. finally. a taste of high school. bittersweet. exactly. first loves, first heartbreaks, first 4.  Kari Fergusson, the very first female I came into contact with. My first best friend. of course over time i accumulated a few more friends. Sarah Coffman. Annie Willis. Emilia Hall. Kate Headley. Michael Jungbluth. Geoff Amstutz, and TJ batten. we were all the orchestra group. I was comfy there. I loved that place. wouldn't trade it for anything. of course, I had my crushes. My first crush was Maggie McCarthy. Oh, she was beautiful. Brown hair with gold streaks in it. After gym I would rush to put on my dad's cologne just to impress her. lol, my dad's...anyway, I used to give her hugs for ahile everyday. But I dont think they meant anything to her. but they meant a lot to me! but then...maggie wasn't interested in me, so i kinda drifted. we're still friends though. I see her here and there. But life was nothing until Heather Shuda showed up. Boy, I sure didn't know what I was missing. She was in my Algebra class for almost half the school year and I didn't notice her. But then at an orchestra...concert practise, uh, for...All-City, yeah, I sat behind her, and Kari sat next to her. Well, me knowing kari and not heather, I spoke to kari and we insulted eachother as usual, being friendly. Somehow heather got in it and she flicked me off. Amazing how in America you can insult someone and they'll become your best friend.  Anyway the following Monday me and heather became friends...good friends. We gave each other hugs, we laughed, we sat next to each other, one time she even sat on my lap.  that  was a good feeling. she liked me and I liked her. problem was...she had a boyfriend. then amber boucher had to come into the mix. heather's friend that is. she decided to have a crush on me too. It was a tough decision. No, not between the girls, but because I didn't want to hurt amber's feelings. well amber asked me out before heather could. I'll always regret telling heather i'd say yes. she cried. she begged me not too. I don't know why I did. I guess the thought of my first girlfriend in jr. high...but in all actuality, I never did say yes. truth is, i've never liked amber that way, and i've always loved heather. I still do, and if i could just tell her that. but i have no way of communicating with her. so if  any of you  know a  Heather Shuda , please tell her  Lewis Culliver  is sorry. That I still love her. hm. and that's all for seventh grade. I miss you very much heather.

      So, then there also was Anganea Collins, who had a crush on me. Maybe she still does, I don't know. but that's all for sixth grade. best teacher in the world there, Ms. Robinson. if it weren't for her, i don't think I'd be as smart as I am now.

      A little bit of luck, a dash of hyper, one or two splashes of blessing, and a pinch of flirting, and bam! the recipe for best friends. well..my friends anyway. This might take awhile, so get comfy. Pop some popcorn, get your pop and candy ready. This story will make you laugh, cry, and everything inbetween. So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...uh....eh..the, uh, ....from Lewie Studios, a Loo-Loo production story here is:   The Best Friend Story  Well, to start it all out we'll have to go waay back to sixth grade. Of course, being me, I quickly scanned the room for any and every cute girl there was in the classroom. there was only one, and, again, being me, I was too scared to talk to her. But she wasn't one of those "eh, she's the cutest in the class" type girls, she was one of  the  cutest in the school. well...to me anyway. Her name was Kenyatta Coffiel. I slipped in the occassional hi or two, maybe a wave, a smile, somethin'. But other than Kenyatta, I remember this other girl, I didn't even know her name, and I still don't, but she was beyond, beyond cute. no, she was hot. to me, she was fine. If I could barely say hi to Keny, how in the world could I possibly muster up enough strenght to say hi to her? even go up to her??? no. not possible. but! I did manage to shake her hand! her soft hand...cold, but soft nonetheless. It was after a school play that she was in, and I was in the...uh..chorus part..thing...and we had to shake hands with the actors. I was happy. very. But anyway, little did I know that Kenyatta was going to be in my life a little more often in the future...   I had one best friend and two good friends. Matthew Wiley was my best friend in sixth grade. Awkwardly, we thought calling each other names was hilarious. like, cockroach, or dung beetle...etc. yeah. the other two were Patrick Murray and LaRay Lewis. We were all dragonballz fans, we all drew (or tried to draw) the characters and stuff, made little comic books out of them.  there was also Ronald...I forgot his last name.

      The crisp breeze of the mountaintop air, the pang of quease as the rollercoaster falls down the high track, the rush you get in a good debate...but the best of all, the feeling of acclomplishment when you know you did it and got through it. But I tell you the truth, it's not just you doing the things you do. It's the Lord actually doing it through you. So don't be so arrogant, or conceited, or prideful-yes, you did it without anyone else's help, but know that God had a large part in it too.   Well it's official. whatever it is, it's official. Hey, guess what? this is filler stuff because i don't know what to type, that's what. OH, hey, yeah, I know...I've finally admitted that I have a crush on this girl Stephanie. yes. What? Yes, she's blonde, so what! You ain't gotta like her. well...maybe you would..don't be gettin' no ideas. She's mine! lol. You know what's pathetic? I don't even know her last name. lol, I know, i know. But...she's so...cool...and..and..pretty, and I assume she's a Christian...I just have to tell her that I have a crush on her. But how? what if she doesn't like me that way? or...what if she  has a boyfriend???  that would be very embarrassing.   anyway. I "liker". she's cool.

      Says I. I am working on a...book/novel. for the adventurous teenager, like myself. it's about a box that...hold on, what am I telling you for? you might steal my ideas and put out a book before I do! I guess you'll just have to wait like everybody else to see what it's about. It's going to be amazing. of course it will be, because Im writing it. lol. er...typing it. why would I write it with my hands when I can just type it with my computer? and print it off...in some type of way? Oh yeah. well. um...I guess I'll start talking about my life..then. that's when you zone out and pay more attention to the fly buzzing around the room, right? ha, yeah. well, uh...what else is there? Can anyone see this? all over the world? I live in Omaha Nebraska...I wonder if someone in Tokyo can read this. I mean it is on the net right? so virtually anybody can read it, right? riiiiight...well hey people over there on the other side of the world. lol, hey look, I found this- it's funny and the person who made the cll needs to be slapped, seriously.    From the WordPerfect Help Desk This is a true story from the WordPerfect helpline. Needless to say, the help desk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing the Word Perfect organization for "Termination without Cause." Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee with a caller: "Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?" "Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect." "What sort of trouble?" "Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away." "Went away?" "They disappeared." "Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?" "Nothing." "Nothing?" "It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type." "Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?" "How do I tell?" "Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?" "What's a sea-prompt?" "Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?" "There isn't any cursor, I told you, it won't accept anything I type." "Does your monitor have a power indicator?" "What's a monitor?" "It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.  Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?" "I don't know." "Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?" "Yes, I think so." "Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall." ".......Yes, it is." "When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?" "No." "Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable." ".......Okay, here it is." "Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer." "I can't reach." "Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?" "No." "Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?" "Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark." "Dark?" "Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in  from the window." "Well, turn on the office light then." "I can't." "No? Why not?" "Because there's a power outage." "A power... A power outage? Ah, Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?" "Well, yes, I keep them in the closet." "Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from." "Really? Is it that bad?" "Yes, I'm afraid it is." "Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?" "Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer."     oh, and here's another...     Top 20 Signs It's a Bad Day You wake up face down on the pavement. You put your bra on backwards and it fits better. You call Suicide Prevention and they put you on hold. You see a ''60 minutes'' news team waiting in your office. Your birthday cake collapses from the weight of the candles. You want to put on the clothes you wore home from the party and there aren't any. You turn on the news and they're showing emergency routes out of the city. Your twin sister forgot your birthday. You wake up and discover your waterbed broke and then realize that you don't have a waterbed. Your car horn goes off accidentally and remains stuck as you follow a group of Hell's Angels on the freeway. Your wife wakes up feeling amorous and you have a headache. Your boss tells you not to bother to take off your coat. The bird singing outside your window is a buzzard. You wake up and your braces are locked together. You walk to work and find your dress is stuck in the back of your pantyhose. Your blind date turns out to be your ex. Your paycheck bounces. You put both contact lenses in the same eye. Your pet rock snaps at you. Your wife says, ''Good morning, Bill'' and your name is George.     well i don't want to keep you guys so i'll be going now. this is Lewis Culliver, again, saying thank you for visiting Spidey's Web..I promise not to suck out your fluids, and discard your empty carcass over the side of my net.
