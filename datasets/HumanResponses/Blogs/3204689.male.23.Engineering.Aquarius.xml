      I've just thought of an ingenious invention. Well, not really, but it would be cool to do. Ready? It's an automagical dog house thingy. It has features such as automagic dog food / water dispenser that allows you to program feeding schedules, climate control, solar cells with energy storage device to save on energy, self cleansing, automagic back-scratcher, shock button (for disciplining), and self destruct button (in case the dog goes Kujo). Throw in a camera or two for monitoring as well as a microphone/speaker so you can communicate with the dog ("go and get me the paper boy") and you've got it made.

      Nat was at school (as usual) and (as usual) his least favorite time of the day was only one hour away. It was always at this time (and without a second difference) that he took it upon himself to worry, to fear, to downright dread what was about to happen, and no sooner than Nat had began to wipe off one or two of the beads of sweat that were (gratuitiously, he thought) forming in little specks across his forhead (Nat hated to sweat), had the bell that signaled the start of PE rung. Nat was startled. Though it happened everyday (really, only on Weekdays, but it felt like everyday to Nat), he could never be ready enough to feel and predict the exact time that that bell would ring (which was unusual for Nat). "The bell is off! They must do that on purpose, perhaps to spite me ..." he angrily muttered to himself, taking care to make sure that his lips didn't move too much or produce a sound much louder than a whisper (he didn't want to be thought mad).

      Today I went to work, again. I'm undercover, as usual, and this time my name is "Lumuba Eleiwa Sipho". Not the most exciting alias, but it's for the sake of the mission. While I was at work today, I literally did sh!t. You heard that correctly, I walked right into that bathroom and I showed it who's boss. I left a small piece of me behind in there though, and I regret that. So much for sh!tting ...

      Missions have been pretty boring lately. No one has tried to take over the world lately, which means that I haven't had a lot of challenging work to do. Perhaps those devils in the NC (Necromancy Clan) would care to start a bit of trouble so I'll have a reason to annihilate them. Maybe even the old PPC (Pyrophagous Clan) could collaborate with the ENDC (Evil Ninja Death Clan) to try and cause some serious harm. They would of course fail miserably because I would use my latest secret weapon on them. I sure would love the opportunity to use my secret weapon. I guess in a sense, we all need each other. Maybe I need the villains, and they need me to stop them. Perhaps they really aren't so evil, perhaps it's because they know that they'll be stopped that they try such bad things. They're so certain they'll fail, that it can't really be considered an attempt. Yeah, sure, there might be a few of them stupid enough to actually believe they can succeed. But they're just plain stupid. Oh well, that's philosophy for you.

      I was surrounded by at least 160 minions of TAC (The Anthropophagous Clan). The only items in my possession were a toothpick, three paper clips, a bottle of hot sauce, and a nanorator (nano-generator; works by cold fusion). It was not possible to construct a device powerful enough to slay mine enemies using only these items, so I had to find more, something that would provide just enough to construct it. Mine enemies were closing in fast, I'd say, about 270 giga-nano feet away, so I had to think faster than their rate of approach. Suddenly I had an epiphany, a not-so-rare spark of Negro-ingenuity. I undressed quickly, and, using these extra resources, I was able to construct an AADB (antianthropophagous death bomb) and a LSTM (light speed teleportation machine). I set the bomb to explode in 2 milliseconds and then I teleported away to safety. All in a days work.

      Boy have I had a busy weekend. Busy? Yes; but busy enough? No! I have a 15 page paper and a 5 page paper both due Monday. I haven't started on either one. Such is the life of a secret agent doubling as a college student. When it comes to the security of the world, one has to sacrifice school sometimes. Perhaps I shall tell that to my teachers and they'll excuse  me from turning in the paper. "Hey, Prof. I didn't turn in my paper because I was busy saving the world from invasion by an ETA (extraterrestrial army) ..." Yeah, right.

      I arrived back at the base with Phat at precisely twelve midnight, exactly fifteen minutes after receiving her distress signal. She was exhausted and badly injured (fractured femur). But she's strong; she'll recover fine. It's not Phat that I'm worried most about. Well, maybe I am, but I do have another legimate concern. The nature of Phat's mission was sensitive, to say the least - a matter of unbounded importance.  The rumors, by the time of Phat's operation, had began. Talk of an evil host seeking to create a weapon of unprecedented power was becomming as common as the talk about The Daily Homocides. The time was not right for action - too little was known about our villain. But Phat was insistent. (Indeed, the contentions of a woman are the bane of every man's existence.) She convinced me to start the planning for a reconnaissance mission, a clandestine expedition that she would lead. I was a master planner and Phat trusted me. Only me. If only it was not for her impatience. (The impatience of a woman is also the bane of every man's existence.) She demanded the plans, threatened to go without them if I did not hurry. I duly informed her that they were incomplete, that I had not yet secured her exodus. She agreed to wait until the exit strategy was complete, but broke her promise in foolish haste. She swiped the to-be-continued mission plans, Mission 1023, and left a cute note saying that she would have to improv the trip home and that she'd call if she needed help but that she seriously doubted whether she would even need to call. (She also left a scratch-and-sniff sample of her perfume attached to the bottom of the note along with the word "smooches".)  I kept a close watch on her since I knew how the mission would begin, but somewhere in the middle, communication became difficult and then impossible. I was unable to transmit the completed exit strategy to Phat so I had to go in after her myself. I was a considerable ways behind, but I'm fast on my feet. I couldn't do a full scale rescue mission because I wasn't sure if Phat was in trouble or not; I couldn't jeopardize her mission because of irrational paranoia - that's what Phat would do. But not I, the venerable Agent Snowflake. I searched for clues. It was the only logical action.

      I'll bet some of you are wondering, among other things, where exactly does Snowflake get the money to do all of his work. Well I can tell you this much, certainly not any government! I use my power for good and for the preservation of freedom; governments use power to aggrandize existing power and for control. The majority of my funding comes from corporations, most of which I started myself (I was quite the inventor in my day). My first claim to multi-trillionaire fame came about from what some think (especially women) to be my greatest invention: The Ultimate Hair Setting Lotion. There are several different types of lotions, one for each style (I was able to make a killing off the signature brands, e.g. Ultimate Halle Berry). You simply wash your hair and apply the lotion. Your hair is now permanently set until you wash the style out with a special reversal lotion. If you mess it up or sweat it out, simply wash your hair again with normal shampoo and your Ultimate Hair Style returns. No more going to the shop and getting your hair "did" and "redid." You get your hair did right at home. When you want to go natural again, you can use the Ultimate Hair Style Reversal Cream to get your hair "undid" taking it back to its orginal form. Wonderful, isn't it? The typical style lasts about 6 to 7 months before it starts to wear out. Some of the more exotic styles last only 3 months.  One hair style sold for about $50. The reversal cream sold for about $25. I sold some 300 million styles in the first year. FYI, this was not my most profitable invention.

      Even I, Agent Snowflake,  urlLink once  had a girl friend. But not even I can claim to have sucessfully matched wits against the ad hominem rhetoric imparted by the illogical brain of the irrational species. I have tried,  urlLink numerously   urlLink innumerably  many times; others have tried, even more times than I; and each time the outcome is the same:  urlLink abject failure . This is a most disturbing and incessant vexation of mine. How does, at most, dubious logicality afford the most insupposable and vicious  urlLink coup de grâce  imaginable? But they are just so  urlLink cute ; some  urlLink beautiful . Therein lay the root of my unamiable disposition. You have coupled together in the same untidy binding, plenary unreasonableness with looks that could, and sometimes do, kill. I cannot decide whether to vanquish them, as with any other evil, or submit to their outlandish demands. Women indeed: threat to the security of the universe / Snowflake's provocation.

       urlLink Reductio ad absurdum  appears to mean what I've heard commonly called proof by contradiction. The web is so wonderful, because according to  urlLink this site , it actually is. So, for the record, reductio ad absurdum is proof by contradiction. It also has the less technical usage of, "carrying something out so far to the extreme it becomes absurd."  In a not-so-language-related tidbit, I give the following example of reductio ad absurdum:    Theorem:  I am good-looking.   Proof.  Suppose that I was not good-looking. Then you would not think that I was attractive. But you do think I'm attractive. Therefore, the supposition that I am not good-looking must be false. Therefore, I am good-looking. The theorem is now proved.

       urlLink Femplesnip  was coined by  urlLink Slashdot  poster  urlLink richie2000 .

To use a neologism is to femplesnip. Femplesnip is also a neologism."  I hope you've enjoyed this moment in "geekguistics" (geek linguistics or etymology or language); I just femplesnipped). ;)

      Have you ever wondered which wording is the best, but you couldn't find the answer in your favorite dictionary? If so, then I have "discovered" (in quotation marks because as far as I know, others may have know this already) a technique may be of use to you. The technique is made possible by our favorite search engine,  urlLink Google .   Let's pretend that we're unsure whether to say, "considerable  way  to go" or "considerable  ways  to go". To find out which wording the web thinks is appropriate, we'll search it for each of the phrases. To do this, you'll need to enclose each phrase in quotation marks when you enter them, so that google searches for the exact phrase. When I ran the search, google returned 38 results for "considerable ways to go" and 2,020 for "considerable way to go". Clearly, the web likes the latter wording best.  Now let's say that we want to be even surer of ourselves. Let us find a more august body of usage authorities. To do this, we use google's 'site:' option. You can tell google to find results from specific domains with it. We'll use it to search the .edu domain. There couldn't possibly be a more august group of usage authorities anywhere else on the web ;)  "considerable ways to go" site:.edu --- 4 results "considerable way to go" site:.edu --- 53 results  So even the universities agree.

    catalogues objects it discovers: 
    
       properties, e.g., color, shape, size, weight, location 
       more ... 
    
    develops affinity to certain objects 
    tells others about "interesting objects" 
    sensors: 
    
       camera (machine vision) 
       motion 
       temperature 
       "human detector" 
       range sensors 
       ... 
    
    maps environment 
    gets "hungry" and finds recharger 
    uses solar energy too 
    does chores, e.g., delivers the paper or something 
    wireless communication 
    
       receives remote commands 
       communicates with PC 
       sends snapshots of new objects to website 
    
    defense mechanism 
    plays game (enjoys winning) 
    has moods 
    ...

        urlLink Cerebellum  is a microcontroller for mobile robotics and embedded applications. It's based on the PIC16F877 board. It has integrated programming and motor driver circuits. 

       The  urlLink old Cerebellum site  has documentation and sample code. It also has instructions on how to build the board itself. 
    

     urlLink Servos  appear to be pretty important in the construction of robots. 

     urlLink Localization and Mapping using Bearings Only Sensors  
    
       What are "bearings only sensors"? 
        urlLink bearing : "6 a : the situation or horizontal direction of one point with respect to another or to the compass b : a determination of position c plural : comprehension of one's position, environment, or situation" (from Webster.com) 
       The environment is sensed "via a bearings only sensor, e.g. a camera." (from paper) So, we're trying to sense the environment without given knowledge of the environment. We only have a camera or another "bearings only" sensor. 
       The robot senses its own motion via an odometer ("through odometry") or inertial sensors. (from paper) From sensing the evironment, the robot produces a map ("sparse, feature based metric map"). So the point of this paper is about the mapping algorithm. 
       So there are such things as "range sensors", e.g. sonar, laser, or millimeter wave radar. But we're using bearings only. 
        urlLink "egomotion estimates"  - it's hard to use these methods with bearings only sensors 
       Oh, this is a  urlLink computer vision  topic 
        urlLink "The Structure from Motion Problem"  helps but methods don't scale well (sometimes) 
       "robot pose", "rigid transformations", "full nonlinear optimization problem", "submap", "landmarks", "global reference frame", "statistics", "rover coordinates", "pose uncertainty", "data association problem", "dead reckoning"

      It seems like it was an eternity ago that I made my first webpage. It's url was  urlLink http://pages.prodigy.net/jaws-scc/centraltrack/home.htm  and the site's name was  urlLink The Track Shack . (FYI, you need not bother clicking on that link. It's deader than a doorknob.) It was hosted by, as evidenced in the url,  urlLink Prodigy.net . This brings to mind the fact that my first ISP was Prodigy. My mother bought the service for us (me) as well as our (my) first computer. The user name, jaws-scc (also evidenced in the url), stood for my mother's initials, J. A. W. S., followed by the first letters of my and my two younger sisters' names, S. C. C. (in case you're wondering, I have a nickname that begins with "S", and no, it's not "Snowflake").  The site was about my  urlLink high school   track team, of which I was very proud (we won all the time). I used it to post results from the meets, statistics, mirror the  urlLink Commercial Appeal 's results of other local meets, and to post commentary on local track happenings. The commentary or news section was my favorite part of the site and was rife with inside jokes and teenage humor.  The Track Shack was not a  urlLink Google  or  urlLink Slashdot  but it had a few readers. It was linked to by a couple of track websites including  urlLink Dyestat  (in fact, Dyestat continues to link to the presently nonexistent  urlLink Track Shack ). My coach, the honorable and world-class Coach John Roberts, even got word of the site from friends of his that had been surfing the net. He was pleased, I think, to have a website about his (my) track team. I'm not sure if he ever saw it, though, as he wasn't the least bit net savvy.  Reminiscing about The Track Shack brings feelings of nostalgia. First computer, first website, high school track team ... I suppose that only a geek remembers his first website with feelings of such warm sentiment. It felt good to create something, and then to be able to share it with the world. And then there's the feeling you get when you find that someone actually took the time to appreciate your creation every now and then.    In honor of warm sentiment, I will republish The Track Shack as it last was. First, I'll have to of course find it. We still have the old 200 MHz Packard Bell sitting at home. And yes, it still functions, albeit, slowly. The url for the track shack will be  urlLink http://www.cbu.edu/~lesmith/sentimental/trackshack/ . It isn't there yet so you might as well not look.  I've said so many good things about  urlLink The Track Shack  that now I suppose it is time to reveal its infamous side. I created the site using Microshaft Word. So, sue me. It was my first time using my own computer, and I didn't know what HTML was let alone  urlLink Free Software . In addition, it doesn't seem like a good idea "to be posting" detailed information about your track team's abilities for other coaches to see (didn't matter anyway though - remember, we won all the time).

The part that interested me the most is:  Lethality Vision:  FFW family of lightweight weapons with advanced fire control, optimized for urban combat, and synchronized direct and indirect fires from Future Combat System.

      I found  urlLink this  interesting. It converts images in the lossy  urlLink JPEG  format into  urlLink ASCII  text. Learn more about  urlLink ASCII art  from  urlLink the people's encyclopedia . At least two techniques for generating an ASCII rendition of an image are outlined in the wikipedia. One is obvious, and I feel ashamed for not immediately thinking of it before I read the article. You convert the image into 8-bit grayscale and then assign each color an ASCII character. The other method is  urlLink vector quantization , of which ASCII art is a special case. Check out this  urlLink example .  What led me to ponder this?

      There's been a lot of  urlLink brouhaha  lately over the  urlLink comments  of  urlLink Bill Cosby . He gave a speach at an  urlLink en double a see pee  commemoration in honor of the  urlLink Brown v. Board of Education  decision. According to reports, Cosby slammed "Black" people for investing  urlLink too little in education ,  urlLink too much into shoes , for petty crime, and also  urlLink Ebonics  (I'd like to add to that definition the proposition that maybe, just maybe, some "White" people speak Ebonics too; here's an  urlLink Ebonics translator ). The reason behind the brouhaha is the premise that not all problems enjoyed by the "Black" community are  urlLink self - urlLink inflicted .  My position on the matter: Cosby is right, but the scope of his argument is not just limited to "Black America." People in general don't value the right things. "Blacks," being people, are not exempt from this maxim. However, being "Black," does tend to slant your concerns to those of other "Black" people, thus it is reasonable that Cosby's statement was directed specifically to "Blacks." In summary, the meat of what Cosby said is true. People need to overhaul their value systems. "Black" people, you're included.

      I've discovered the following maxim: There's a fine line between sanity and instanity; all persons are either on that line or insane. Generalizing, I arrived at a "super-maxim", by which other similar maxims can be derived, e.g.: There is a fine line between a moral person and an immoral person; all persons are either on that line or immoral. The super- or general maxim is: There is a fine line between [persons who are] X (virtue) and [persons who are] Y (opposite of X): all persons are either on that line or Y. Finally, I leave you with a couple of a couple of alternate wordings (and an ellipsis): The line between sanity and insanity is infinitely thin; I've never met a person who wasn't either crazy or hanging by a thread to that line.  There are two types of people in the world: crazy and borderline-crazy.  There are two types of people in the world: dead people and dying people.  Everybody I know is either dead or on their way.  ...  Moral of the story? Be thankful you're not on that thin-assed line because it's really a tightrope, and after you've finish falling you'll have a broken ass bone - in addition to being yet another high-strung fruitcake.

      [I] haven't done much today. [I've] been working on icons for my web site(s)/page(s). Simplicity is the name of the game because they have to be recognizable at 32x32 and 16x16 pixels. Add to that my artistic ineptitude and you have the preliminary results:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink    (Note: click on the pictures to see them full size.)  These graphics were all created using  urlLink The GIMP . The remaining obstacles seem to be finding a program to create .ico files (haven't searched yet) and making a nice icon (or several of them). I still have a considerable way to go, and maybe I won't make it, but damn it, I tried.

      A job, like a woman, can be both a blessing and a pain. If chosen correctly, your job can suck the life right out of you. You're lucky if you can chose a job that doesn't. The reasons that we work are sometimes as clear as mud. The Bible says that if a man doesn't work, neither should he eat. So, we work to eat. My uncle once told me that there are two kinds of work: a man at work and a man's money at work. My grandfather once to me, "work your mind, not your behind." My father passed on a similar aphorism: "work smart, not hard." To top it all, a professor told me the definition of super-engineer: an inherently lazy individual who does the least amount of work possible to get the desired result. So there you have it - work doesn't have to be hard. But the Bible says, "lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth." What does it all mean? Who cares. The point is that I don't want to be at work right now. Good day.

       urlLink Mr. Black's World   Mr. (or "Dr." as he is commonly called by local patrons) Black is a man who believes that children are capable of anything if we focus them in the right direction. He combines a no-nonsense method of instruction, deep philosophical nourishment, and high expectation to produce students far beyond the traditional bar of excellence. I first met him at  urlLink Yo! Memphis ; he was teaching a group of kids. I can't remember the topic exactly but I remember being impressed with the lesson. Later, I heard Dr. Black on  urlLink WLOK  radio (Leon Gray's show). He was speaking about his teaching philosophy and about a program he was running at  urlLink Rhodes College . I took my nieces to Rhodes a few times, but it did not become habit because their home is unreasonably distant. Some of the things Dr. Black suggests children learn are  urlLink multiplication tables  out to 30 x 30, foreign languages, etymology, and physics. The catch is that he places no age restrictions on who is taught. He has the older children teach the younger. In fact, most of the teaching is done by other children! I'm not familiar with every little detail of Dr. Black's method, politics, and philosophy, but from what I observed he's doing an excellent job.

The first person I heard mention it was DJ Simpson; that was in a math class; he got it off the internet.  Theorem: Women are evil.  Proof: Women require time and money, so women = time &times; money. We know that money is the root of all evil, so money = sqrt (evil). Also, time is money so time = money. (1) women = time &times; money = (money) &times; money = money 2  [substitute money for time] (2) money = sqrt (evil) OR money 2  = evil [squared both sides]  From (1) and (2) we have: money 2  = evil and money 2  = women. Therefore,  women = evil [if a = b and a = c, then b = c] Q.E.D.

      I was on the  urlLink Wikipedia  and happened to be reading about the  urlLink Age of Consent . There is a listing of the age of consent for several countries and for each state in the  urlLink United States . For the US, the lowest age I saw was 13 (homosexual, New Mexico). It is odd that the age of consent for heterosexual sex in that same state is 17. There are also several states listed with an AoC of 14 (Hawaii, Missouri, South Carolina). The lowest age in any country listed is 12 (Argentina - in certain cases, Canada - with a 14 year old, and Mexico). If I had to average them all, without a calculator, I'd estimate an age of about 15. Since I live in  urlLink Tennessee , I'll mention that the AoC 'round these parts is 18.  What does this tell us? I'm not sure. It is easy to pass judgement on places with an extremely low AoC, and in some cases I do. But the truth is that in God's eyes, the only AoC is the age at which you get married. If we were truly concerned about morals, then that would be the AoC. Not 18 or 25 or 36, but wedding night. You'll receive the same amount of hell for dying in your sins, not matter what they are (according to at least one theology). What I'm trying to say is that, yes, 14 is an immoral AoC, but likewise is 21 if the participants are not married. Who's to judge which sin is worse?  In summary, if you live in Tennessee and are grown, stick to the 18+ year olds. Don't be looking in other countries for young girls either, 'cause that can be illegal too (read the Wikipedia article).

      I've decided to take up the task of bringing my niece up to speed on a few things. Like, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, etymology, math, anatomy, etc. My goal is to transform her into a super learner. A few of the tasks I have in line for her, just to get her started are:       Memorize the Declaration of Independence (at least the first two paragraphs)         Read and understand the Constitution     Learn medical nomenclature and the anatomical structure of the human, this includes (but is not limited to):           Learning the bones in the body, where they are, how to draw them, etc       Learn the structure of the heart, brain, and other major organs       Learn how the main organ systems work         Learn to use the dictionary to trace a word back to its Greek or Latin (or whatever) roots and to create "element charts" or graphs that show relationship between words     Learn foreign phrases used in the English language and how to pronounce them correctly         Learn the states and capitols (US), countries (and capitols if she gets enthusiastic about it) of the world, major lakes and other geographical features     Obtain an extensive vocabulary     Learn the history of the world         Learn how the stock market works and the basics of economics     Learn basic mathematical proofs, algebra, and geometry     Learn the scientific method     Many, many more things (mainly the stuff they either don't teach or half-teach in school)        Now some people think this is too ambitious a task for a little girl. Given that the best of us manage to use only 10 percent of our power, the average being an abysmal 4 percent, I think she has plenty of room upstairs to put stuff in. "Why bother," some may say. To which I reply, "Why not?" There're quite enough average people in the world!    Here's a list of the resources I've been gathering in case anyone else wants to do so with their kids:        urlLink USConstition.net  : Copies of the Constitution and other historic documents with explainations for different grade levels     The  urlLink National Archives  have proved useful  This  urlLink third grade science  page at UT Martin has information about teaching science including activities you can do        Now go do the right thing.

       urlLink Origin of the Alphabet  from professor of psychology  urlLink George Boeree  (boo-RAY) at  urlLink Shippensburg University  : The alphabet was developed by a Semetic people in Egypt. It was based upon the Egyptian hieroglyphics, only they used their own symbols. From Egypt is spread to the Canaanites, Hebrews, and Phoenicians. From the Phoenicians it reached the Near East, Asia Minor, the Arabs, Greeks, Etruscans, and as far west as present day Spain. The site has a table consisting of the Phoenician alphabet along with a reconstruction of a possible earlier alphabet.    Of course, there's the  urlLink Wikipedia  article on  urlLink the alphabet . Since we've found that the alphabet was based on the  urlLink Egyptian hieroglyphics , we'd better do some research on them.        earliest known hieroglyphic inscription dated circa 4240 BC     combonation of  urlLink logographic ,  urlLink syllabic , and  urlLink alphabetic  elements     hieroglyphics derives from the greek words  hiero  (sacred) and  glyph  (carving)     the Egyptian name for heiroglyphics is  urlLink transliterated  as  medu netjer  (words of [the] god)     consists of 3 kinds of characters           phonetic characters - single-sound characters (like an alphabet) and multi-syllable characters        ideographs - characters that represent a word       determinatives - characters that specify the semantic category of a word without indicating its precise meaning         simplified forms developed,  urlLink hieratic  (priestly) and  urlLink demotic  (popular), as writing spread     391 AD - Roman Emperor Theodosius I closes all non-Christian temples; hieroglyphics all but cease to be used     400 AD - few Egyptians capable of reading hieroglyphics     4th century AD - Horapollo creates  Hieroglyphia , an "[a]uthoritative yet largely false" exposition of amost 200 hieroglyphs, "a lasting impediment to the decipherment of Egyptian writing"     1800s - Rosetta stone "discovered" by Napoleon's troops and  urlLink Champollion  deciphers the hieroglyphs by 1830s       GreatScott.com has an  urlLink introduction to hieroglpyhic writing .    AncientScripts.com has a  urlLink nice piece on the alphabet . The modern alphabet is the product of about 4000 years of evolution. Also, there are alphabets which are completely different than the familiar "Roman" alphabet.    Ancient writing : Tidbits of  urlLink Development of the Alphabet  :        whether all acient scripts are of pictogrphic origin is debatable         pictographic - most writing systems went through a period of picture writing which included phoneticizing the picture and using the  urlLink rebus  principle to extend its range, e.g. a picture of a bee followed by a safe could represent the phrase "be safe"         acrophonic - from the pictographic phase, writing evolved into the acrophonic state where only the initial sound of the picture is represented by the picture, e.g. a picture of a bear would represent the 'b' sound, an alligator would represent the 'a' sound and so on     logographic - these are pictures that stand for entire words; the differnece between logographic and pictographic symbols is that logograms' meanings need not be extended with the rebus principle      While we're at it, I'll throw in the  urlLink Spelling Reform Ring  free of charge.

We converted them to Google. We created the verb, "google", and used it first, before the journalists reported its existence. Because of this, it pains me to reveal what has been revealed to me.

      Last night Teazy came through and we played Soul Calibur 2 for a while. Of course, I employed Xianghua to do my dirty work. He initially played with Seung Mina but soon drifted to other characters in his usual manner. I eventually abandoned Xianghua to play with other characters because it was getting too easy.  Later, we went to Bookstar and I picked up  The Miseducation of the Negro  by Carter G. Woodson. I read an introduction, the foreward, the preface, chapter 1, and a little bit of chapter 2 before I retired for the night. It's an interesting read so far to say the least. If I had the book with me, I'd leave you with a few quotes.  Wednsday, I went to Mr. Black's class at Java Juice and Jazz. I can't describe the overriding theme at this point but I will try to summarize when I get a thorough understanding. Among the topics discussed were "natural law". I didn't take notes so I can't say much more than that without a cue. That's not to say that I don't remember anything, but that I can't recall it spur of the moment. I would remember it if I heard it again though.  Once I finished reading, I went to sleep watching Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon. I didn't even talk to my baby girl. She's probably mad about that. Mea culpa, mea culpa. Can't wait to see you next week.  We're having a family reunion this Fourth of July weekend. There's a gathering at my house (my aunt's house) today. There's be food, swimming, and plenty of "Black" people, my people to go around. Be there or be, uh, round!

      Who would have ever thought that the Articles of Confederation were ratified in the year of "dooky foot" or that the Constitution was ratified by a "thug vibe" or that the Civil War happened during "tough shit, chill!" There's a mnemonic technique called the Major System I discovered while over at the Wikipedia. It's a phonetic memory system used to convert numbers into words. Here's how it works:     0. s, z 1. d, t, th 2. n, ing  3. m  4. r  5. l  6. j, sh, ch, zh (like the s in vision)  7. k, g (hard - like the g in goat)  8. f, v  9. b, p  The vowels and h, w, and y are used as spacers so that you can spell words. Examples:      "dooky foot" = d _ k _ f _ t = 1  7  8  1 = 1781 (remember, only the consonants get counted)     "thug vibe" = th _ g _ v _ b = 1  7  8  9 = 1789     "tough shit, chill" = t _ f _ sh _ t - ch _ l = 1  8  6  1 - 6  5 = 1861-65    The possibilites are unlimited, but first you have to memorize the phonetic list. Hope this helps with your history.

      This country has always fared reasonably well so it doesn't surprise me that it continued to do so under the auspices of President Bush. The two things people will remember President Bush for are (1) 9/11 and (2) the War in Iraq. The previous statement should not be construed to mean that Bush was responsible for (1); only by heartfelt conjecture and conspiracy theory is this result obtainable. However, it should be construed to mean that Bush was responsible for (2), and this is the number one reason people are against Bush. People don't like war, period. People hate unnecessary wars, period. The alleged reason for waging war against Iraq was that it was an imminent threat to the United States because it possessed weapons of mass destruction. So we destroyed Iraq with our massively destructive weapons. But no WMDs or evidence of WMDs were found in Iraq. This implies to some that there were no WMDs in Iraq. If there were no WMDs, then Iraq was not an imminent threat to the United States because it possessed WMDs. Therefore the War in Iraq is perceived unnecessary, QED.
