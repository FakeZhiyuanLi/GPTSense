      Webmastery has taught me lot. Well, not a whole lot. But a bunch of html stuff, and I need that for my lj (livejournal if you're stupid). I learned like, how to like, make things go like  this . And  this . And  this . Quite helpful. Webmastery has taught me everything I need to know for LIFE. I need not learn anything other subject. I am set. Thank you Mr.Rea for touching me in a special way. O! and I learned how to do this :      I also learned that some people can be  incredibly  annoying. Debbie knows who I'm talking about.

      I am a cockroach and my name is Edwardo. I am a Colombian drug lord and dance mega star. I have been to many many places and see many many things. I've met over tea in Venice and exchanged eyelids, coreographed a hip hop dance and karate special to a symposium remix by a DJ from Luxemburg. I have flown to the moon and, realizing I could not breathe there, took on 2 astronauts until Superman arrived, who encased me in a glass plate in which I floated for a few decades. Upon my escape, I was frozen in carbonite by Darth Vader. All these experiences have traumatized me deeply and I spend thousands for a therapist who tells me that a chocolate chip cookie will help a bad day. Life is depressing. I spend my days in resturants eating the many crumbs dropped by customers. I have to move from place to place in order to get some rest. If not, I will surely get caught and killed. All of my family was murdered by Jorge, the mafia king. My life goal is to find Jorge and slaughter him. I will not rest until I get justice. For now though, I must flee. There is not much time and people are giving me suspicious look because I am a cockroach typing on a keyboard.

      I hate almost everyone in my family. And the people that I don't actually hate are just messed up so I end up getting annoyed with them. But since you're making me choose and I want an "A" on this poo, I guess I choose my grandpa. He's a total and complete racist. Everything that comes out of his mouth is about fighting in WWII or about everyone that comes into this country and how they should leave. But this isn't why I choose him. I choose him for one simple reason. The other night, somehow the topic of my grandma dying came up and I said, "Well, grandpa what would you do if she died? You'd die of starvation." And he said,"You know, I used to rely totally on your grandma for food. Then they came out with healthy choice." That's probably the only decent thing that has ever come out of his mouth during my life. Plus it was damn funny. So I choose him, just because of what he said last week. My brother's decent sometimes too.

      My future. Now that's a scary thing to think about. I know I wanna go to college, because I want to live in a loft, and I'll never be able to afford a loft because they're so damn expensive if I don't go to college. College is damn expensive too. Anyways, once I get out of college, I'd like to get a job as a journalist for a music magazine. So I guess that would make me a music journalist. That'd be pretty damn cool. All I really want to do in my future is live in a loft and write. I'm not sure about kids. I'm not sure if I'll be married.  I just want to live in a loft and write. Over time, my feelings and thoughts about my future might change some. But for right now, they are pretty set. There is no confusion about my future, and I don't know how to use the word "aspiration" in a sentence. Theoretically, I'm cool. Anyways, my future might seem a bit bland. But it's what I want to do as of right now. And I think I'll be happy if I my future became a reality. "I was walking in the park and I saw this kid flying a kite. he looked so amazed and happy. I don't know why. It's a kite. They fly. Now if he had a chair on the other end of that string, I would have been impressed."

      I wish I could say I had no regrets at all. But I don't regret many things anyway. I certainly don't regret running away, or dating certain people. Everything I have done has taught me a lesson, and I'm grateful for that. The only thing I really regret doing is buying a cellphone. Those things are the most addictive things ever. First of all, once you get your new number for it, people who you don't even know call it asking for the previous person who had it. That's incredibly annoying. Second of all, once someone sends you a text message, then you write back, you can't stop! It's like you go text message crazy. Sending text messages back and forth, checking your phone for new messages or just simply reading the old ones over and over and over. That'll certainly rack up the phone bill. And then, and oh this is really annoying, you get your phone bill and it says you've made long distance calls to like Afghanistan and you were talking to whoever lives in Afghanistan for like an hour. Now, I don't know anyone that lives in Afghanistan, and even if I did know someone that lived in Afghanistan, I certainly wouldn't be on the phone with them for an hour. Whoever makes the bills, needs to seriously keep all this in mind. One thing I do like about cellphones is how cool they look. Those things look so freaking cool. However, they keep getting smaller and smaller. Do you know why they keep getting smaller? So you'll lose them and you'll have to buy more so you can make your collect calls to whoever lives in Afghanistan. I have a huge problem with cellphones but I am also equally obsessed with them. I kick myself in the head for ever buying a cell phone, and thinking I could use it as some sort of substitute phone when I was too lazy to get up and get the cordless. I ended up having a $430 bill. I hate cellphones. I regret ever buying one.
