        For quite sometime now, I have felt that I have been wasting away precious time from my life. The time in which I could have built something useful not only to me but to others as well, the time in which I could have gained more knowledge, become wiser and moved onto the next level of enlightenment (I assume realizing this is the first one). During one of my frantic and desperate searches to do something worthwhile, I came across this really great statement by  Scott Stark, CTO of  JBOSS  . The link is -  urlLink http://jboss.org/community/overview    For those who have no clue of what Open Source is, read this you might end up being one of the super stars that Scott talks about.  JBOSS is an open source Java application server, I was looking for ways as to how contribute to it. This article is a must read for any programmer who has ever thought of contributing to open source.

       For all those action movie fans, Vin Diesel symbolises the ideal action hero. He's got lot of attitude, muscles and style. ;-) This was the second time I was watching this movie. Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a most-wanted fugitive, being searched by a number of planetary systems. He is being hunted all the time by mercs (mercenaries) who are looking for a prize. While saving his own ass, and kicking asses of such mercs he ends up at the planetary system of Helion Prime.  Where he meets one of the Elementals (those who calculate future using probability, we havent got such people right now I think, but the concept is not bad) , who make him realize that part of him which he has forgotten. That he is a survivor of planet Furia, that he is a Furian.  Helion Prime in the meanwhile is under the threat of attack from the Necromancers (a breed of people led by the Lord Marshal, how is half human and half something-that-nobody-knows-what-he-is). Their motto is "You keep what you kill !", a very bold faith which leads to some interesting dialogue scenes in the movie.  In the events that follow we see a lot of great action sequences especially the ones on the triple security prison on planet Crematoria. The movie proceeds in a good speed, great special effects and amazing scenes. It is a must watch for all sci-fi action movie fans.  PS : The theatre we visited was Plaza. It is a no go ! Pathetic screen, pathetic sound, pathetic movie print. But if u have no other choice, I suggest take the cheapest tickets at least you will be nearer to the screen to listen to the sound.

       Had the opportunity of watching this amazingly disconnected oddball of a movie yesterday. Mujh se shaadi karogi another attempt of mash-mixing hit hollywood flicks by David Dhawan.  Anger Management, Meet The Parents, Matrix  the movie draws from all of these  foren  films. The movie is basically a comedy masala movie. ( lots of oomph ! like the  kanta laga  girl playing the role of  Bijli  and doing an item number) .  David Dhawan is banking on making money by attracting  desi  audiences by showing some  maal . Having  Baywatch  attire through out the movie. (Though I give credit to the movie for having a great collection of songs).  I spent half the time waiting the movie to finish.  Sallu baba and Akshay kumar spend most the time showing off their muscles. And for a change Akshay kumar is the saving grace ! The guy did a good role in Khakhi too, I guess he gives a good performance whenever he is cast in a multi starrer, so for the want of competition he ends up raising the level of his show.  I should say this as a final verdict, like my friend Makkhi says : "Dimag mat lagao !". A thing easily said but tough to do, when u have nothing else for 3 hours to do.  PS : Those new to Bglore from Delhi, the theatre was NAGA in Ulsoor. I suggest dont go for the front row, its out right discrimination they have actually put chains between the front stall and others so you have to come out of the hall to goto refreshments ! Besides the chairs in front stall are hard wood ! Talk about difference between a 30rs. ticket and a 50rs. one.

        After graduation from college you look for a job, in my case I landed up in Bangalore (25th July 2004 - for the record), ending up to work for off shored IT division of a US company. Work hard, earn lots of bucks and party hard. The office is on MG Road, its as famous here as the Silk Route is in the Eastern World. Banks, companies, malls, theaters, Dominos, Pizza Corner, stolen goods market, smuggled goods market, Baristas, Cafe Coffee Days, book shops, video game parlors and of course a lot of indian population - a good big package of things compressed on to a long road. (no doubt roads are lifelines of a country)    The weather in Bglore is much like that in Europe, only the traffic is much more and lot more indisciplined. The first Saturday night I ended up buying a Tag Heuer watch.... a cheap imitation of course ;-). Bglore is a young city with fast life and a hubbabub of multicultural torrents mingling with each other. Its like a young teenager trying to look cool too fast, living life in the fast lane but only his style is cramped the lack of space and bad roads. In every other corner u would find a tech company, each one trying to become a behemoth - a collective effort though disconnected that might turn Bglore into a spank new version of Silicon Valley, outside the US of A.
