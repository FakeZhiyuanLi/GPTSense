      A strange title for a blog I know.  It does have some relevance though.  Yesterday I was on the penultimate weekend of my practioners course, the subject area we covered was the treatment of adult survivors of child abuse and the protocols for treatment.  *yawn* I hear, interesting stuff probably, but so what?  The odds are that 1 in every 8 adults are a survivor of some kind of abuse. Sexual, physical, emotional, or all 3. Sure enough in our group of 8 I know of 2.  One guy (yes GUY) suffered terrible abuse, and me? Well, not that bad in context I suppose. My abuse was emotional.  Emotional abuse I hear you say? Whats that then?  Imagine this scenario.  You are out with your partner, having a meal.  Without any conscious intent, they put you down somehow.  Could be over your choice of wine, what you are wearing, what you chose to eat or not. How does that feel?  You are out to enjoy yourself and WHAM that happens.  Or you are late for a party and your partner makes a comment about your timekeeping. WHAM.   But these are just innocent comments surely?  Maybe if they are one offs. If they are continuous, or the put downs are a stream, a flow of minor critisisms.  This is emotional abuse.  I was abused on a sexual level too, but not sexually.  I wont go into it here, yet.  I dont feel strong enough.   So, listening to all the associated psychological sypmtoms, behavioural manifestations, the guilt, shame, all of it, instead of becoming a lecture on the generalities, I became aware of what I was feeling, and how it was affecting me,  I became dissociated (that "spaced out" feeling you can get), agitated and quite shaky.  Listening to others in the group discuss it like the insides of a frog in O'level Biology seems to diminish it, the suffering it can cause. With that diminuition, I too became small again. A child, vulnerable and hurting deeply, with no-one to talk to, to take the pain to.  Once again, at 41, I had no-one to talk to, no-one to take the pain to.  So again, I had to sit and strip the emotional content from the issue, intellectualize it, disempower the feeling and myself.  And then I wrote it down here.  Like crying in the night.  No one to hear, or if they hear, no one to care.

      Where do we begin? In our genes, probably. What we learn from the cradle to the grave? Most certainly. When does that learning process begin? From the very moment of life itself.  As mere babes in arms we learn what smiley faces are, we learn who our parents are. In that period of time we know that the world is them. We fear the loss of their love, as they provide everything we need, physiologically and psychologically. So in order to prevent that loss, real or perceived, we develop strategies, defences, techniques in order to keep it.  As children the one thing we need is to be loved for ourselves.  Loved by our parents for just BEING.  It is this that allows us to develop our true self, our self esteem.  Being allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, not harshly punished for any minor misdemeanour.  Being praised, genuinely, for our achievements, being praised just for trying, these are what we need.  We get praise for our achievements, however if we continually succeed, these become expected, and failure becomes a harsh disappointment to parents, a loss of love to us.  If we continually fail, we are stupid, silly, clumsy. How many times has failure become a terrible punishment in its own right?  Wetting the bed becomes a heinous crime, punishable by extremes.  Its not seen as part of the development cycle.  Words like "He was dry at 18 months you know!" or "She was walking at a year" seem to come from people proud of their children.  What of the parents who's daughter wasn't dry till 3 years, or even 8 or 9?  Their perception of failing to meet the norm becomes a failure of the child.  The child feels it deeply.  We develop at our own rates.  It is the nature of things.

      Been thinking about loss.  Silly thing set me off actually, Claire Goose getting killed off in Waking the Dead. She really should get a job without afatal ending :o)  Listening to "Another World" by Brian May doesnt seem to be of use either,in understanding loss, the vast empty sense of it, even when the loss isficticious or real, close to you or a thousand miles away.  This year has been about loss.  Firstly in April an old friend died, aged45, of lung cancer. An inveterate smoker.  He left 5 children, oldest 22, youngest just 4.  You see the loss of his family, feel it in yourself that apart of your past has gone.  Selfish thoughts. Didn't see him much in the latter years, always thought he would be around in the background.  Then a friend of mine lost her Mother. A terrible ordeal for her and herbrother. They laid on an incredible funeral, horse drawn hearse, the AveMaria, all the trappings of grief.  But who was it for, the one who was gone, or the ones that had lost her.  She was dead, so it held no significance for her.  It was, as ever, for those left behind.  Last month, a neighbour, who has been around for many years, lost her eldest son, aged 19, to an abcess on his liver.  There the sense of shockand pain was incredible.  The numbness, the sheer disbelief. The hurt and misery. Friends and family, all grieving.But is death the only loss we ever have to suffer.  I wish it was.  The greatest loss of all, so society thinks, is death. I dont think that istrue. Death of the self has that macabre honour. Death of the self?  What on earth are you rambling on about?  As a child, innocent of the vaguaries and politics of later years, all we want, need, is to be accepted and loved for WHO we are, not what we are, whose son or daughter we are, how clever/strong/stupid/weak we are. Acceptance of OURSELVES.  When this doesn't happen, slowly but surely parts of our self die. One little bit by little bit. Piecemeal. Till one day there is nothing of usleft, just the needs, wants, drives and thoughts of other people, mainly parents, whose "self" is placed way above our own.You can be the smart fat kid, never picked for anyones team at football, but never missed out if its a quiz.  You can be the skinny kid, brilliant at sport, or art, but quite poor at anything else.  You can be the pretty kid, the ugly kid, the smelly kid, the bullied kid or the bully.  Your achievements and failures are used to reward or punish you.  Everytime you hear the words "Why cant you be more like......", they devalue you.  Tell someone long enough and hard enough that they are lazy or stupid, that they are liars and no-one will believe them, then thats what they become. The self dies.   Thats what we are looking for.  Ourselves.  The real self, that great potential squashed and despised because it didnt fit with what parents or others thought.  The frail new personality, denied and starved until it dies, to be replaced with an empty, unreal shell.  A lie.  This great loss then gets fed.  People come into our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime, so the saying goes.  Once that season is ended, the reason met or the lifetime ended, once again we grieve for the loss.  Loss of them for sure, but for once again, a loss of part of our true selves.  Friends come and go, relationships begin, blossom and die. Parents and relatives die. All natural parts of human life.  If we had not lost ourselves, we could mourn properly, thank providence for having them in our lives, and continue, changed, but continue none the less.  As we have lost ourselves, each loss is felt keenly, seen to be part of some theistic conspiracy to deny us anything to love, or be loved by.  This is simply not true.It is our true self that is dead.We can revive it though.  If we try. If we can find the help to rekindle it.  I dont think I can see far enough inside to find the spark. The effort of starting it all over again seems  futile. Would I know what I looked like if I found me?  I suspect not.  Be gentle on yourselves

      So at last I have decided to join in the BLOG revolution. It has taken me long enough I can assure you.  Where to begin? I suppose a brief history of me, and why I am who I am.  I am 41, male, 6'8" tall, follicly challenged in cute kinda way (I do look like either Jeremy Spake or the Hood from Thunderbirds in a certain light), medically retired from Birmingham City Council, live at home and am a carer (for my Mom)  God that sounds like the comic book guy from the Simpsons !!!  I am fascinated by what makes up the rather overworked and misused expression "Depression".  The medical model; the humanist model; the holistic approach; all of it.  It is partly a voyage of discovery for me.  Most of my blogs will be concerned with this.  So be warned.  Be gentle on yourselves
