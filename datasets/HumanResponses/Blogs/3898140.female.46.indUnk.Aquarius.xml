      I got the new job that I applied for -- so I will no longer be an insurance underwriter, asked to review 28 files a day, constantly under the gun.  What a relief.  The hours will be worse, in a way.  I previously worked noon to eight PM and that gave me time for a bike ride almost every morning and time do those little things.  Starting August 9th, I will work 8:30 -4:30 PM.  It will require tremendous determination to get home, throw on the bike clothes and go.  It's simply out of the question to do it in the morning.  Out of the question.

      I'm working on clearing out a file cabinet and came across the divorce decree from my first marriage.  New York State requires a reason to get divorced, one has to provide a definition of irreconcilable differences.  Initially I started divorce proceedings and my ex-husband decided that he needed to be the plaintiff since he didn't want to divorce.  It didn't matter to me as long as I could get the divorce.  Reading the complaint a couple of nights back really shook me, as the reasons were all about me not wanting to sleep with him.  That is true, I didn't, I was sick of him, sick of him not working, of sponging off me, of not cleaning up after himself, basically tired of being with someone whom I didn't respect any longer.  What scared me was the fact that I am so not interested in sleeping with M right now.  Doubts flood in -- am I just frigid (no, I orgasm just fine)?  Am I struggling with a loss of respect for M right now (yes, that is true, has to do with him only working infrequently and hanging around the house too much and having few interests)?  Am I so selfish that occasional masturbation is all I need (maybe)?  My least favorite part of all this is the fact that I dislike myself right now.  That part needs to change.  All the thoughts that literally rush in - -you are a lousy wife, you are selfish, you are lazy.  Those come in the night, there are better thoughts in the day.  I'm strong, sexy (this is fake, but if I write and try to think it, it will be true some day), funny and filled with irreverence.    Off to work.

      This post goes to fear and its plague in my life.  I am to meet a friend today for a bike ride.  The weather is marginal, cloudy, poured down rain just a bit ago, and I don't want to go into town, pack the bike on the car and risk being caught in the rain.  Anything out of the ordinary, any change in routine, any deviation from the pre-work routine slays me.  I don't know the path we are taking, I can't see the route in my head (as I can on my daily ride) and it's that seeing of the route that gives me comfort and stability.  Here, the first mile or so is in the sun, going around the big curve, listening for cars behind me (I don't use a mirror on my bike or helmet), with a slighty incline.  Then shade and the swamp, downhill and small burst of speed, another batch of sunlight and sad homes to the left and right, in which people lead lives that I imagine are centered around TV and fast food, more shade and the pines that smell like my grandma's cottage down in North Carolina (an ages old smell memory that has never left even though the cottage doesn't exist anymore and the smell is from 35 years ago) and then into the peninsula with the nice homes and fancy lives (just as likely to be revolving around TV).  This section is where I do my bursts of speed and effort and can feel the muscles burn in my ass and thighs.    Part of my reluctance today is that I will be going to work afterwards and all I want are the comforts of home for as long as I can have them before I go into the office.    If change is what I'm after, then let me try change and risk the rain and unfamiliar road.

      All went well and while a small polyp was found, the doctor feels it's nothing to be concerned about.  Enough on that.  Doctor's offices are interesting and appalling places, I find.  Seeing how infirm everyone is, the false cheerfulness, and I did feel a bit of envy that the employees were sort of hanging around casually when not working.  A wave a guilt and anger crosses through me each time I have a casual conversation at my job.  A voice always talks right behind my head -- "get back to work, get back to work."

      Only a short note for now.  I'm taking M in for a colonoscopy (routine) and then heading to work late.  It takes all I have to make it through a day there.  Good, smart people I work with, but the pressure and daily failure take a toll.

      There must have been a heavy rain last night.  The swamp I ride by on my usual bike route seem filled with water and the air is damp and weighty.  A motorist stopped me on the way back to tell me that he'd just seen a lynx cross the road, he held his finger up for silence and then we heard it call out.  Eerie.    M (my husband) returned from a weekend music festival late last evening.  The entire weekend was mine to do with as I pleased and I decided to slow down and rest.  The urge to drive myself the entire weekend was strong, to work on the pants pattern that I've been promising myself I'll perfect, to organize all the sewing patterns, to.....  ad infinitum. Instead I took the dog to the ice cream parlor.  She enjoyed her vanilla cone and then promptly threw it up.  Good to have that experiment complete.  Chocolate peanut butter with coconut almond delight in a waffle cone was my treat, which I did not throw up.   A long conversation with a friend came next, talk of marriage, bike riding, family --- I can't say how these conversations help me.  This woman is a gift; she's my age, sharing my same concerns of aging bodies, unfinished lives, turning 50 and what to show for it, how to be fully with a family and fully with oneself, and she is bawdy!  A nap in the hammock came next, after reading several chapters of The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.  This delightful interlude was rudely interrupted by a Family Pride salesman stopping at the house (next time, I'll close the garage door -- the simple of Not Home in my neck of the woods) trying to sell me steaks.  No thanks three times and the dog giving her horrified opinion the whole time.  Now, the nap got serious.

      All of a sudden, I'm shy.  Why am I here doing this?  I've been in a nasty struggle lately over my job, my sex life, my perceived lack of time, so I thought I'd come here and write it out.  I also hope to keep friends posted on the goings on in my life. My poor husband bears the brunt of all my dismay and perhaps I can ease that burden by writing here.  Gosh, this makes my life sound so miserable.  Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm in good health, I'm in a deep, challenging, satisfying relationship with a man I love, I'm close to my family, and I have a great dog.  The standard laundry list of a satisfied soul, sounds like, but I only feel satisfied in my own home. surronded by my books, fabric, garden and people.  It's my job that brings misery. Or that I let bring me misery, to be precise. This is what plagues me right now.  Day in and day out, five days a week, I underwrite insurance files, with tremendous pressure to finish a certain number of files a day, keep current on all pending files, be cheerful, provide good customer service, but not too much as that will cut down on productivity.  I live in small Michigan town and my employer is one of the better ones and it's a decent work environment except for an oppressive focus on contests and rewards.    Coming on my 50th birthday, as I will be in 3 years, I've been thinking about where I'd like to be then.  Hamstrung by all the normal fears of someone my age (retirement money,health care, job safety), I've discovered that I am enraged, enraged by all the jobs I've ever had, in an office, in a cubicle, doing someone else's bidding with a smile on my face, enraged at myself for never taking any risks.    There was a time when I had the dream of being a writer and lately it's the dream of a home sewing business, but it is just all dreams, dreams, dreams and I am lucky to sew a T-shrt once every two weeks.   So I am here, thinking out loud and seeing what this will bring, this blog.  My grandmother died a few years ago and my mother had a stack of her love letters.  My grandmother's second husband (my mother's father) had written them and they were beautiful, elegant, and a treasure.  Ever since reading those, I've often thought what a sadness that a life would not have a record.    So here I go on my record.
