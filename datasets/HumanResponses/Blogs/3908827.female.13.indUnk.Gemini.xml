      Today I was on EMS. I love those guys so much. I would protect them with my life. Anyhow, Yupui was talking about spammers and he posted this:  What I was thinking of... A crack team of people who worked around the clock to to put the exact chainletters into the auto block. I'd be tedious, but then again, I'd also be tedious to change the wording after a while. And instead of blocking them, they should just replace it with "I'm a stupid spammer" just like they do with the "this is not a scam" thing.  I laughed so hard! Good times with EMS. -sighs- -happy tears- :')

      So...things end this way? The worst way of all ways to end? 'Cause love sucks. Love sucks like craz-eh. It's nice while it lasts. Be careful, 'cause my heart is turning black. You have to come and save me from This creature I've become So today, I go on to saw on my anger On the used-up lead And wait for the world to end. You made me want to die. You made me cry My heart out. So don't Leave Me alone Like You Did

      So this is my blog. I have several thoughts that will come whenever, so random things are just fine when it comes to me. So let's start off with stupid people rants. Okay. Stupid people are simply the death of me. They make dumb desicions and make people mad with their stupidity. They make me want to run off a cliff.

      I talked to Steph on the phone today...she said she missed me a lot. We're best friends...and we aren't going to the same school next year. It's horrible. I have to go to freakin Ghettobrook and live with the biatches there who will completely tear up my life. So I'm taking a vow of silence when I get there.  I begged my mom to homeschool me. She said she would when I ran away that one time. But here she is, telling me that I have to stick it out and live with it.  Yeah. Right.  She has NO IDEA how much I belong at TPMS. I just belong there. Ghetto-freaking-brook is the land of 5 sides: the gangsters, the nerds, the punks, the goths, and the preps. I'm kind of in between...where the freaks are. I'm not a gangster. They're rude to me. I'm not a nerd...see any glasses? Nope. I'm not a punk...that's dangerous hanging with them. Goths are okay, but they're too...angry at the world. And preps? Heck, no. See any blonde or pink or strappy sandals on me?  I dunno where I'm supposed to belong in that school. Where do the girls in black and camo go in their combat boots?  Ugh...this year is going to suck so badly, I want to vomit. Or watch Ghettobrook implode...I wish. And that girl Chanel! I have to put up with her crap in church, and now this? She thinks she is the smartest being on the face of the earth just because she's Little Miss Perfect-And-Popular-And-Sweet. Perfect and sweet, my arse. She is pure evil. Pure freaking evil. She thinks she's superior to me...how old is she? 12. How old am I? 13. Yes. Overtaken by a 12-year-old. Ours is a sad, sad world. Nobody is superior to anybody...we are EQUAL. Apparently the little biatch can't figure that out. I wish I could take this pencil and ram it up her nose and teach her a thing or two about how I don't take crap from anybody.

      Kitei dashed as fast as humanely possible to school, her legs burning, the stitch in her side twisting painfully. School was, once again, the cause for her aches.  The catgirl had brown hair and big brown eyes. Her whole body was covered in grey fur with black stripes. Her ears were very large and her tail was very long, and the tip of it was white. She had a long whisker in each side of her face that went to her ankles, as did her hair. Kitei was her name. And she was late to algebra.  She stopped at the door, panting as she stumbled inside. Kitei plopped into her seat next to her friend Koneko.  Koneko was another of her kind--a catgirl. She didn't have fur covering her whole body--just her ears and tail. They were black. Her hair was purple, and it came up in two buns, then it came down in two braids. Koneko-chan loved her hairclips--she put one into each bun. One was a blue flower and the other was a red heart.  Math was boring, as usual.  "Who can solve this one that we did for homework?" asked the teacher, a very tall creature with two normal eyes and a large green one in the middle of her forehead. She had a long sea-green dress and violent, bright red-violet hair.  Kitei, being highly intelligent, raised a furry hand and went to the board. She gazed up at the white expanse with oddly enormous eyes and picked up the marker.  She made a few marks on the problem and thought for a minute, then put on the cap. She stood back. Ms. Yamachi looked at it.  She looked a little taken aback. "Why...that's correct, but...how...?"  The rest of the kids seemed to be asking the same thing. Kitei looked utterly unaffected as she smiled faintly to Koneko. She gave the tabby a thumbs-up with a grin.  She drifted back to the table, still smiling.

      Yup. Mishi's on a shopping trip. With a cute little outfit. Awe, isn't she cute? Yes, I wrote 'fwah' up by her tail. XDD  It's funny how much girls are easier to draw than boys. It's scary. o.o

      He's one of the main characters and accompanies Mishiranu to Warui Onna's palace. Boys infuriate me so. I can't draw them. ;_;
