       Am i a cold hard bitch?  I think i'm far from it thank you.  Hehe  Hey if my love life's track record doesn't improve then this song might really be about me...eventually.      Gotta leave town Got another appointment Spent all my rent Girl you know I enjoyed it Ain't gonna hang around till there's nobody dancing I don't wanna hold hands and talk about our little plans, alright! Cold hard bitch Just a kiss on the lips And I was on my knees I'm waiting, give me Cold hard bitch She was shakin' her hips That's all that I need Gonna check her out She's my latest attraction Gonna hang Tround Wanna get a reaction Gonna take her home Tcos she's over romancing Don't wanna hold hands and talk about her plans alright! Cold hard bitch Just a kiss on the lips And I was on my knees I'm waiting give me Cold hard bitch She was shakin' her hips And I that was all that I need I'm waiting give me Cold hard bitch Just a kiss on the lips And I was on my knees Yeah I'm waiting Yeah I'm waiting Yeah I'm waiting Yeah I'm waiting Cold hard bitch Just a kiss on the lips And I was on my knees I'm waiting give me Cold hard bitch She was shakin' her hips And I was all that I need I'm waiting give me Cold hard bitch Just a kiss on the lips And I was on my knees I'm waiting give me

        I seriously love this song so so so much.  I love how I can hear a song and completely relate to it 100%.  This is one of those songs...I just want to be loved, more thank anything else in the whole world.  So, that's really what this song means to me.  I will be loved...I will.  When and where?  I wish i knew.            Beauty queen of only eighteen   She had some trouble with herself   He was always there to help her   She always belonged to someone else   I drove for miles and miles   And wound up at your door   I've had you so many times but somehowI want more   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   I know I tend to get so insecure   It doesn't matter anymore   It's not always rainbows and butterflies   It's compromise that moves us along   My heart is full and my door's always open   You can come anytime you want   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   And She will be loved    And She will be loved   I know where you hide   Alone in your car   Know all of the things that make you who you are   I know that goodbye means nothing at all   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautifu   lShe will be loved (repeated)   Please don't try so hard to say good bye.
