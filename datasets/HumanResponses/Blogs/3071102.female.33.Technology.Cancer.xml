       I have fallen off the wagon.  I couldn't help myself, it had been WAY too long, and I really just needed a small fix... But of course, as always, it brought a profound smile on my face, as it always does...  And it can't be bad if I am not doing it EVERY DAY right? Yes, I went to see my absolute, all-time favorite blues musician-Sean Costello. First, he's perfectly adorable. Second, he's a hell of a singer and guitar player. Third, he always seems like he is singing JUST for you. It was funny, one of his new songs I just totally related to... something to the affect of "you loved me, when I didn't love you"  And of course, being in NST, listening to Sean and having him sing a song where a fella is using a woman for her money so that he can go play with other women totally reminded me of last summer's experience with my SCHMUCK. I think that I am in a VERY good space/place away from that entire experience... although sometimes I reminisc a little too much... to which I quickly say "BAD HABIT".  Sometimes I say it aloud just to be very firm with myself... my crutch, my negativity, my anger that I came away from that with sometimes overwhelms me and takes away any good outlook on life. But back to Sean... I didn't stay too long.  I always have a good time when I go, but as usual, I was by myself and just wasn't feeling like being out, and being alone.   I got to talk a little with the band... no, not to SEAN, the band.  I can't seem to make myself even say hi to the man, I am not sure why.  But, when he is on the stage... I can't take my eyes off of him. I will definitely be in line for the new cd!

       So, I'm up early... EARLY, and dressed and ready to roll.  Why???  Because I was supposed to have an interview, that was cancelled about 1 hour before it was supposed to happen. I was of course, very excited, somewhat nervous, etc. Now, I am just disapointed. This job hunt is going very, VERY, VERY! slowly.  And I am tired of the companies that are like "advertisers" for jobs.  I know that there has to be a better name for them, but for the moment lets stick with that.  Those companies that have to tell YOU how great their company is.  They have websites, and an endless monologue of propaganda about it.  Companies like that make me are suspicious... good companies to work for I believe, simply ARE.  It's practically non-spoken. For instance, I had a woman call me last night on the phone.  It was about 9:50PM.  A little late all the way around.... if you ask me. She asked to speak to "Doe, Jane"  And when I continued to ask her what she wanted, she at first wanted to confirm if this was "Doe, Jane"  To which I replied, my name is actually Jane Doe.  And she said, really?  It says here Doe comma Jane.... hey dumbass!  ever read a roll call before?  If that is where the comma is that is my FIRST name!  But I didn't get into a conversation about grammer... since she said that they were looking for "interviews" but didn't seem to know what I actually DID for a living...  I was amazed... she had obviously seen my resume, but hadn't read it?  And why was I the perfect candidate for her job? Needless to say, I told her that I was not interested, and hung up. The search continues.

       early in the am, I am back from my bday adventure. It pays to be reserved and simply listen to people, because you hear volumes.... unfortunately I can't always turn down the volume so it doesn't always help. It wasn't MY bday adventure, but someone elses. I was feeling sad because I wasn't invited to a dinner beforehand... that I helped to recommend somehow... but somehow got excluded from. No clear explanation was given but after my second drink, I cared alot less... plus alot of other people were busy bearing THEIR SOULS so, what could I do, but just listen? Fortunately, I came with a friend... that was SICK!  (generally, this isn't a blessing!) but tonight it was as I was in conversation hell! I was listening to one friend go on about how he just couldn't be bothered to be in a relationship or commitment to another individual (translation.... I can't be bothered to clean my bathroom of the pink and green mold that now live in it.... along with the 3-4 inch hairballs covering the bathroom floor.... well not for just ANYONE.) And also to listen to another girl that I barely know tell me about her past 3 relationships.... including the 2, and 3 that I just careened by her as she lived them.... And then to hear her tell me about how they are all "sweet" "great" guys and how one of them was a great  "transition" man.... and very well versed in certain areas.... hmmmm interesting... And then the one girl that I had expectations to be a good friend... who had already lied to me about said bday boy being too "overwhelmed" to have a bday dinner with us... which excluded me to actually being invited to said event... which was sorta disappointing as I was originally involved on "the plans" to celebrate his special event.  It sorta surprises me when this type of shit happens.  If you like people, you tell them why you didn't invite them.  Bday boy said that his friends were invited... and that they left.   *disclaimer... had a "moment" with this particular couples "friend" which may have considered me "uncomfortable"   but ya know we are all adults and we all know that NO ONE likes to be unicluded, when they originally were. Would a note have been unforthcoming? Anyway... back to the point, well sort of. I really liked this girl.  I thought that she had a certain class/style/poise that I would love to have in a friend. Unfortunately.... this doesn't count. No poise/class/style on this particular move. And then she just made some comment on my outfit?  I swear, since SCHMUCK... i am just too damn cynical of people, period.

       You know how you feel when you find out that someone that you felt close to, doesn't feel as close to you? Well that's where I am at the moment. I understand logically that I haven't really known this individual that long.  It doesn't stand to reason that I would be involved in the intimate circle of this person. But to be not included isn't fun.  Especially when you thought it wasn't going to happen in the first place. I suppose that I will just deal. "Get ovah it", as they say. But it still stings, especially when you thought that you were becoming closer friends with those people. Does that mean I hold back? Does that mean that these people really aren't who I thought that they were? Or is it simply... what I said in the beginning. I suppose that I will eventually find out.

       MADAME BUTTERFLY TODAY  I had the opportunity to see the opera Madame Butterfly yesterday... written by Puccinni. I am way into music, and enjoyed it greatly.  The sets, the costume, the singing (all made easier to understand by a modern miracle, the supertitle... literally subtitles above the stage, translating the action for you), the last act moved me to tears. As usual, it's all about lost love in these things...  why else would someone inevitably try to kill themselves (and generally succeed) in the last act. But I was thinking, how would modern times interpret Madame Butterfly without an international incident? It's about a naval officer getting into a marriage contract with a Japanese girl that is for 999 years, but renewable every month?  (Lots of legal issues there already... in this day and age, certainly our little Butterfly would know what a pre-nup was) Of course they shack up, she gets denounced from her family for renouncing her faith (and going to the Christian faith of her new hubbie), and he leaves shortly before she finds out she is pregnant with his child. Oh, the next issue... she claims to be 15. I don't think that that is legal even in Japan these days, do you? And he's an officer of the United States Navy, I'm smelling courtmartial don't you? And child support, and lots of other things for this wayward officer Pinkerton. (And WHAT a name!  he even sounds like a weenie doesn't he?) Then Pinkerton returns with his new American wife (BIGAMY!) to reclaim his son... Of course, when he realizes that Butterfly NEVER abandoned him, or thoughts of their "love" he freaks out and hauls ass.  Of course to return as Butterfly does the honorable thing and kills herself... after giving her son over to the new American wife. Is this a Jerry Springer show or what? Of course the son would grow up with all of this, and cashing in on it bigtime... from Daddy to Mommy's demise.   Probably suing Daddy for mental anguish.  (Do you think Naval officers would make enough to cover the legality of all this?) The maid, of course would be writing books, and making guest appearances on talk shows... helping on the new blockbuster hit of "Madame Butterfly's revenge" or something of that nature. All of her clothing would be up for auction, not to mention the sword that she used to kill herself... EBAY!   Yes, I could see how exciting Madame Butterfly would be now, many years later.

       SHALLOW 1)Measuring little from bottom to top or surface, not deep. 2)Lacking depth, as in intellect or significance  I haven't been blogging at all due to a collision with shallowness... Yes, it's amazing how quickly you hit the bottom of another person's personality and it causes you to skip over the next few days in amazement... I expect the best in folks, and unfortunately, it's generally a big set-up for disapointment, however... I find that you can always surprise them and yourself by expecting the best. I recently pressed a gentleman (and I use that term loosely), about why he had not been really introducing me around (it was sort of obvious).  His response was the collision, "well, I really like EVERYTHING about you, but your hair color"   "I was hoping that I could get over it, and I am willing to try.  Maybe in a little while it won't make any difference." I was stunned.  This man was balding.  He had the proverbial spare tire. And he was concerned with my HAIR COLOR? I reminded him... "There is more to me than my hair color..."  "I hardly think that someone in your situation should be critical of me... after all you are balding and barely have any hair"  "Even if I died my hair, wouldn't I always wonder if it was really me that you liked?" His reply was even more interesting... "But I've discussed with you what I INTEND (very key word here... I'll get back to it) to do about my hair.  All the hair club for men ads that I asked you about, different hair magazines with dying solutions that I have shown you and you never mentioned once that YOU wanted to do something different." "Well, why should I discuss what I intend to do with my hair color with you?  I mean, after all, most men aren't interested in the beauty options of women... hair, nails, clothes??  After all, you knew what my hair color was when you met me, and we have been dating for a month?  You weren't attracted to me at all?" After all, even though he intended to do something with his hair... he was the one combing with a rake.  The situations and names have been changed to protect the innocent and of course prevent any lawsuits that may arise from balding, spare tired men. Yes, it's caddy of me to refer to him that way... but if he can be that shallow... aren't I entitled to a few parting blows? After an experience like this, I know why some people prefer animals to people...

       YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A BAD DAY WHEN.... AND CHOIR DRAMA CONTINUES  You know that you have had a bad day when the first thing that you want when you step into the door is a drink (of the adult kind) and a cigarrette (esp when you generally smoke when you are 3 sheets to the wind). Don't you hate it when you start your day out by being late? It's not enough that you are awakened out of slumber by whatever noise, light, cat leaping on top of you, etc... but then you realize that the clock somehow doesn't seem right.  And what I mean by right is correct... it seems to be reading at a different hour than you normally awaken.  And then, in the next 15 seconds, it clicks... because the light coming in your window doesn't look quite correct, and you know you feel a little too well rested... and then you realize why you were dreaming about being trapped in a house when you so desperately needed to be somewhere and your ex-boyfriend was there thwarting you, teasing you, making you linger because you are wandering what the fuck he is doing there in your dream in the first place!  Of course, the dream is bad enough.  But then you get into traffic.  Traffic of the variety that you are NOT accustomed to contend with... which is why you generally wake up EARLY. Ok, so you have your coffee, because at least the coffee pot woke up when it was supposed to and produced it's magical brew.  You have tunes... but you are in a rental car, and you don't have the exact variety that you are accustomed to, and you know it's going to be a long commute. However, it's still early, there is time to be optimistic based on the rate of speed that you are going and how much ground that you are covering. And then, you hit the traffic wall. That moment, when you realize that it's NOT going to get better...no, in fact, it's going to get WORSE!  and it does, and all that you can do is sip at the remainder of your coffee, try to stab at the buttons on the stereo and distract yourself.  "With acceptance, comes peace" So, you've accepted, you've come to some sort of peace with yourself... and then you get to work. An entire other set of issues to deal with, personalities, explanations as to why you are late... phrasing it so that you don't look so idiotic... because you feel kind of bad.  I mean, we all get upset when someone is perpetually late... or it happens on a really BAD morning for lateness, etc.  but then we do it, you do it, and you can't help but feel a little twinge. And then, "with acceptance comes peace" You know, and please tell me if I am wrong... but when you are late to work so early in the morning... the groove is gone before it gets there, you know what I mean?  Oh!  and the choir drama continues... The day before yesterday as you know, there was an emergency meeting for the choir to decide how to proceed as our choir director was clearly overmedicated for his problem with depression. Oddly enough, the choir members present (can't say I was there... too much drama for me) decided to split under another director.  (which I completely agree with) All of this was cool, great!  We were going to meet at another location even. And then we all received the expected goodbye email from the old, depressed, overmedicated, director. And then another letter from the same... By the third, I was done. Or, so I thought.  Because of course there were replies from members of the choir, some derogatory, some not... The not was either chastising the members that had been derogatory, or aplauding other choir members for coming "clean" about their depression, and applauding them for it. No offense, I do aplaud these individuals for dealing with their emotional issues.... but I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! If this is bitchy, then call me a bitch.  But I barely know these people, so please!

       INSANE CHOIR DIRECTORS AND THE CABLE COMPANY  This am, as I try to clear up my bills... I am thwarted by the cable company's automated "on hold" system...  Conveniently, if you are trying to downgrade your service it conveniently hangs up on you somewhere between the 5-7 minute wait time.  What a racket!!! How perfect, the customer CAN'T get thru and therefore continues to pay the pig!   I am NOT paying the pig, but instead intend to take even MORE time out of my day to pop in to say hello and attempt to get this straightened out. I downgraded 2 mths ago, you'd think that they would have the billing corrected by now... ahem, but NO! In the meantime, to complete my morning ritual... I go to check my email, only to find another cooky letter from my choir director... who it seems has been overmedicated by his therapist. He showed up late and disoriented at the last practice... which fortunately I did not attend. Then he wrote a bizarre email about the list of medication that he is  taking, his life long battle with depression and being confronted by the cops???  Needless to say there was an "emergency" meeting that was held last night... which unfortunately I did not attend.  (or fortunately)  Too much drama!!  I just wanted to sing, that was all. And this am, this second letter from him.  He's just too creepy for me! EEEEEuuuuuuwwwwwwww if you know what I mean.

       It is Sunday morning and I am contemplating paying bills and doing laundry after a nice, big, fat breakfast including just about every bfast food that one can eat in one sitting... Eggs, bacon, grits, toast, fruit!  Coffee with half and half even, I felt like I was at a hotel (with the exception that I made it AND cleaned it up). I am trying to track down a friend that is supposed to be in town, but I haven't heard from her yet. And her daughter isn't answering her phone, oh well... The kittens are on the porch, trying to bait birds to land on the railing... and it's starting out to be a nice lazy Sunday with no plans in front of me at all... except for the bill paying. I am so excited about my vacation that is up and coming! I get to see my cousin, step-sister, godson, grandma!  It hopefully, will be a nice break from everything that is or isn't happening fast enough in my life. Is it June yet?

       The car accident made me worry even more about school. What if I quit my job, wait tables, have to depend on my family for money and then something like this comes up? I get a headache just thinking about it. And it turns a smile into a frown. There are a few people that wish to live vicariously through me in this experience.  And then, of course, there are those, like myself, that think that I am just plain nuts. (and I myself, am beginning to wonder) I think what the whole idea is supposed to be is taking that leap off the ledge... the departing from your life into another... wondering if it can really happen.  If things will just fall into place? I'd love advice if anyone has done something radical like this... words of encouragement, or words like "you'd better do this first or you really are a coconut short..."

       MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GET BREAST IMPLANTS I admit it, I turned on Ricky Lake today as I was cleaning the house.  You know, like you do for background noise...  but as you know, these shows are like train wrecks... you just sort of find yourself watching them and wondering what these poor people did in some former life to be run over by the karma train and end up on Jerry Springer or Ricky Lake.  (as even Jerry Springer mentioned to the audience in one of his shows, "If you're on this show... you know it can't be good.") Today's Ricky was all about "extreme breast makeovers", of course, they took other parts and pieces off the women as well... for the "makeover part" I suppose. All the girls were in their mid 20s, would be my best guess.  Hell, one even had her boyfriend with her at her operation (and exactly why did she feel so insecure about the whole procedure??? was it him???) But they all made it sound like this was the best damn thing that they EVER did... and how much it increased their self esteem and gave them confidence... Some things that disturb me (beyond all the little girls at home watching how easy it is for them to change their body by knife for a new look), well what I just mentioned disturbs me too.  But with all of these makeover programs, is it any wonder why people are so disatisfied with themselves?  Playboy, Men'sIllustrated Swimsuit Edition... advertisements.  Is it any wonder how people can be so irrational if their nose has character, if they are tall, if they are short, if they are curvy.  Whatever happened to what's inside someone?  And women are just as bad, GQ, Mens Health... I know that I sneak a peak between the covers of those mags to see what's smoking once in a while. The truth that we all know... ok, maybe not until you are closer to your late 20s, or just EXTREMELY insensitive, shallow or STUPID ... once we get under that pretty wrapping, we taste something sweet, but soon begins to make us sick to our stomach.  Because the candy coating was all that there was... and if I can elaborate a bit more, sometime there is a stinking pile underneath it... (which can REALLY make you sick!) Ok, ok, I hear you... some simply WANT a taste... nothing else.  (but not most, not all)   Isn't it about time that we start learning to live with who we are, and not the idea of who we someday hope to be?

       RUN DOWN ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON So, coming home after a pleasant afternoon in of all places, Flowery Branch, not even 2 mins from home, I get into an accident. The entire side of my car got swiped, my rear tire, punctured. The young man that was in this accident with me, was extremely apologetic, even helped changed my tire.  He wanted to take care of the damage himself. I had already called the police. When the police got there, we gave a rundown of the accident. When the policeman tried to give me the citation, I asked for a more elaborate explanation as to why... The gentleman that hit me, was after all, in my lane... attempting to make the same turn as I was. I pointed to the glass in the roadway before the road that we were turning onto started... "OH!" was his reply and took the citation away from me, and went back to his car. He then returned and gave the young man the citation, and told me to contact my insurance company with the report....etc etc What a pain!  I hate accidents!  As if my poor car hasn't been through enough already.

       You know the type of people that are always first in line for the free buffet?  The kind of people that just sort of push for every benefit that they can possibly get?  The first to ask, what comes along with that? Well, I realize that we are all looking for some sort of bargain along the way... in one form or another.  And "it never hurts to ask"... but I bet that you know (as of course, do I) at least one person that is just pushing it to the limit... and of course... killing some opportunities as well for you.  (Because the "benefits" have  been abused...)

       The game was as awful as it felt earlier in the day.  The weather was poor, my mood worse... I went to the game determined to be hyped to go.  I was, and suceeded in such until a girl on the other team was injured.  She probably needed stitches.  The other team wanted to continue to play, and lets just say that they were out for blood, I suppose to replace her own. Needless to say we lost.  I was very irritated by the entire game, I was not in the mood to continue after the girl had been injured, and was definitely not ready to meet the players in such an aggresive mood.  We do play in a competitive league... but it still is supposed to be flag football.

       Dreading the game... I have been doing bills, laundry and all assorted Sunday chores... and upon finishing am trying to kill time before going to play flag football. I am not understanding why the game has not been called off because it is incredibly windy and the ground is incredibly wet... not to mention it appears as if the sky will dump buckets upon us VERY, VERY, VERY soon. And my biggest beef is the time of the game... not until 6:30PM. I am dreading this game, as we play different teams every week, but they are continuously the same people over and over and over again. Can we hold onto our top slot?

       It is raining and I have finally managed to drag myself out of bed.  After all, it is a Sunday and it is RAINING.  And it has been RAINING since I left Highland Tap last night at around midnight. I like to hang out in the Highlands, always have.  We went to not only Fontaine's last night for dinner but hiked it down to Hand in Hand for a drink as well.  Then for some reason, one of our crowd suggested a change in venue to Neighbors.   This would have been fine except for 3 things.  First, when we got there, we added chairs to our table.  (to which the waiter insisted we turn the table around for better traffice flow)  Second, after looking around at the crowd (and feeling like the oldest people there), the same person in our crowd said we should have gone to Highland Tap to begin with.  I suggested we go, having been the one to resist earlier, it was simply because it was beautiful earlier and why miss out by hanging in a bar where you aren't sure if it's day or night? Well one girl in the crowd had actually forgotten her id.  So for the third thing... Ok, we were all in our late 20's, early 30's in this crowd.... so no prob right?  Well, instead of just trying to get in, one girl had a broken id, and passed it along to her.  The first bar we go in, no prob. But they had left Hand in Hand after the other half of the group was already inside Neighbors.  This extremely astute tattoed young lady, who we will refer to as "Bouncer of the Year", saw thru the ruse and immediately began to interrogate the young woman.  To the point of removing her id and taking it immediately to the 18 yr old manager.  (so he could do what exactly?) After a little name calling, and id retrieving, we parted Neighbors and moved to Highland Tap, where happily NO one checked ANY ID'S.  BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PISS OFF, BE CAREFUL WHAT YA SAY Because last night, I ran into someone from my home town... sort of "six degrees" but not even that many.  She is/was best friends with an old ex-girlfriend of my brothers... who (brother) graduated 2 yrs ahead of her. And yes, I was FREAKED out for a bit because... "It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all, it's a small, small world!"

       Last night I got to see another of my favorite singers, the one, the only Chris Jackson.  He played acoustic at Eddie's Attic to open for some other bands.  I always enjoy watching him sing and play.  It was quite a contrast to see him play by himself last night, and not with the entire band like several weeks ago. He is extremely talented, and I enjoy seeing him alone or with the crowd of his band.  If you see a posting for Big Vessel or Chris Jackson, I highly recommend that you go!

       YIPPEEEE! FREEDOM! I am finally over it!  No one, except for two people, actually READ my blog... I feel free, free, free at last, free at last!  Ok, so maybe I am going overboard, but you never know when it pays off to be too paranoid.  However, now I know that no one is really "watching" this spot will simply be whatever pops into my head... so be careful...don't be offended, or I will simply refer you to this post. It's the "as I am thinking it"... not necessarily, "I'm thinking this applies FOREVER!" You've all been warned, not that you cared, but this is my notice of my rambling mind!

       BAD BOYS, BAD BOYS, WATCHA GOIN DO? I am notorious in my bad taste of men, and had an unusual thought tonight (of course, as I sat in my philosophy class!)   Girls, can you imagine dating a philosopher?  A man so caught up in defending different truths and perspectives... that you probably would NEVER really find out what he really and truly thought about something?  (And even if he really and truly believed it... if  someone could convince him otherwise... BING! there he'd go, falling like a tree....) Wouldn't that make a fun blog?

       ZOMBIES, PLANE CRASHES AND EX-BOYFRIEND'S.... Needless to say, I've been having some nightmares lately.   I can't decide if it's stress or maybe just eating too late at night?   But to wake up thinking that flesh eating zombies are after you and somehow, because you're asleep (or technically at this point, HALF asleep), it seems extremely real.  And you have to take several deep breaths, and convince yourself, no matter how real that it seems, that it was just a dream. But for as real as that seemed, I then dreamed that a dear friend of mine died in a plane crash, and even had the privilege of seeing the burning embers of it.  I spent most of my dream trying to disprove that they were on the plane, and had to again, wake up and convince myself that it too, was just a dream.  (this one was very real, and it took a little longer) Ok, but the last, and the most convincing one... I'm on vacation with my family and I show up to this house on the water... there's my family, my step-father... and my grinning ex-boyfriend.  I just say to my step-father, "out of what crevace did you drag this out from under?"  My step-father mumbles some reply and LEAVES me alone with him. Unfortunately, this is one of THOSE ex-boyfriends, of the lying, slimey kind that you told that you never wanted to speak to him again and you meant it. Of course, the dream doesn't end there... he practically SPENDS the entire vacation with us, and I have to avoid him.  I think my family was probably smoking pot or something to have permitted it... but after all, this was a dream you know?   This last dream left me so pissed off, at my step-father of all people.  I mean, I woke up really unhappy with him.  It took a good bit before I could let go of that feeling... So let's see, I think flesh eating monsters are after me, my friend dies, and I'm about to see someone that is going to make me extremely uncomfortable... I think I need to stop eating that ice cream before bed!

       Why is it so important to forgive people? Several girlfriends of mine suggest that it is important that one must be able to forgive to move on.  I have been someone for years that has been able to practice this.  But now, I have run into something that I can't forgive.    I have moments of forgiveness... followed by a complete lack thereof. I just wonder why this is so gosh-darn important in the overall scheme of things, and how is it really going to overall effect my life?

       I THOUGHT THAT I LEARNED THE WORD , "NO" WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG... But apparently, have not. I have alot going on!  I mean like work, this class (can you believe that they actually WANT ME to write a paper???)  ((I can write about STUFF... go on for paragraphs about different things... but, as my high school AP teacher informed me years ago, "Babe, you beat around the bush... get to the FLIPPIN point."   Ok, maybe she wasn't THAT extreme in her speech, but you get the point right?)) The point is (see I did it again, didn't I?), I have a lot going on.  I just wanted to stay a little focused... REALLY focused, no distractions, etc. Well, that didn't happen, I am going back to my cousins already on July 4 weekend. Silver-tongued bastard.  How did he talk me into it? I know it wasn't the fact that my sister will be there. I know that it wasn't that my other cousin would be there either. Hmmmmmmm I'm stump-ed. Any thoughts? Anyone???

       THE PERFECT WAY TO START THE WEEKEND... Was to get my long-awaited pedicure.  I went determined to actually GET one this time, not to be daunted by a long line or a high price etc etc  So, I went to a tried and true establishment just down the road from work, and coincidentally, on the way home. It, of course, was well worth the wait... but perhaps not worth the look the pedicurist gave me when she raised my foot to look at the bottom of it.  Yes, I had Barney Rubble feet (as my friend affectionately calls them... you know how Barney had to make the car go?  well... can you imagine how his feet looked?)   For women, I don't have to espouse the wonders of the pedicure... I mean, you just pay someone to rub your feet, AND they end up looking good at the end, what more could you want? For men... I recommend that you always give your significant this gift... spoil her and you may not be responsible for these chores yourself! (unless of course, you are into that type of thing...)  but we won't get into that at this time! The rest of the weekend was busy, and not terribly relaxing, but it of course had MOMENTS!  Next weekend, I vow to do as little as absolutely possible!   I have been far too much on the run during my week and need SOME TIME!  I know that you are all dying for an update on my philosophy class... well we had our first "lively discussion".  Of course, the hot topic was politics... of course the 9/11 commission... of course, the real reason why Bush attacked in the first place were in dispute due to some of the early reports of the commision.  I admit... I was not ready for the gentleman seated behind me to so vehemently say to our teacher, "EXCUSE ME, but I am not finished."   The surprise was not all mine though, the look in the teachers eyes was priceless. Perhaps we can debate on a less "hot" topic next time, as it seemed that all, when polled, had some very strong opinions on the topic.

       BEING BAD/BEING GOOD So what is more fun, I ask?  The Dog, and the Rabbit took me out for drinks on a school night and it turned out to be later than expected.   I am not a Rabbit, actually, I might be a Pussy, or possibly a Squirrel, but it has yet to be completely agreed upon at this stage. If I was a Rabbit, then perhaps I would have not been tired the next day at school/work...  but of course, I was!   I was completely entertained with lots of beautiful men to look at, until I suddenly awoke on the Rabbit/Dog couch at 4AM.  Oh well...  I was off to home, and bed... and lots of beautful, but gay men to think of.

       ANNOYING PEOPLE at work... You know, the person that ALWAYS has a comment about everything, and it is usually NEGATIVE.  He/she is not the little ray of sunshine that you want to see when you walk in the door... nine times out of ten they aren't even AWAKE until they have had their gallon of coffee and whatever sugar/McDonalds that they brought in (and then they REALLY get on a roll).  AND you don't seem to mind if they have the day off, because generally the office is a little quieter. I often wonder, what service does this person provide to the store... where's the asset?  And especially to the customers... because usually if the customer isn't familiar with her/his technique... they may get annoyed, and may even still... Do the "bosses" really pay attention to what's up? I suppose that they know better than I, after all, I am not a boss of any sort...  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  Second class, very interesting, my teacher likes to debate... from his comments, his first class was more lively than we were.  I don't get into debating, recently though, a not-to-be-mentioned friend of mine engages me in playful debate... and I do find it fun to stump him (cuz generally he's just pissing me off!)  I suppose that in the next few classes, I will get warmed up... I'll keep y'all posted.

       WHEN TO HOLD EM, WHEN TO SHOW THEM When is it too long to have worked somewhere? Is it possible that  even after coming back from a vacation, you find that are your co-workers WERE as SURLY as you perceived them before you left, it wasn't your imagination. Is that when you know? Or is it that silent scream that is building up in the back of your throat, threatening to emerge every time that you open your mouth? Or when you want to bring in some crazy glue and get creative with those desk dwellers? Or perhaps... I just really want to be back on vacation ALREADY.... Perhaps to a sunnier, not so wet climate, get some rays, play in the surf, etc etc etc AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

       SOGGY SUMMER VACATION/HAIRBALLS EVERYWHERE I cannot believe the amount of rain that I have seen across the east coast in the last ten days. I have just arrived back from my vacation, a whirlwind tour of family in Virginia and Westerville, OH. I know that I did indeed see some sun, amidst lots of wet, rainy days. A winery trip, Strawberry festivals, a trip to the movies with 7 nephews and a niece, a graduation party for my sister, were a few highlights. I do love to see family, but at the same time, you can't help but reflect on your life, where you were, and where you are now.  I am still stunned that it was only (and the fact that it was... ) 15 years ago since I graduated high school and left my father's house.  I had big plans, things to do, college to finish.  I did, and I began work.  And now, I want to change again.  Tonight I had my first class.  I haven't been to school in 13 years.  It was entertaining, interesting, and just the least bit intimidating.  I have HOMEWORK.  I have a teacher that is a PHILOSOPHER, and actually refers to himself as such.  (for some reason that makes me laugh.  Philosopher as a profession... ever see History of the World?  Mel Brooks is standing in line for unemployment, when he gets to the head of the line, and she asks his profession... he says "Stand Up Philosopher".. and she says "Yeah, Bullshit artist." Don't misunderstand me,  the dude knows his stuff.  Most of the time I could follow what he was talking about! I have a feeling that this is going to be an interesting summer... I actually get to write ESSAYS!!! whooo-hoooo....  I can't believe that class is over already and I have LOTS to do... many pics to download and get ready to take to the lab tomorrow... a floor full of fur from my kittens... with a conveniently non-operational vacuum cleaner, and even with nothing terribly interesting to say here I am, blogging.  Amazing, talk about avoidance!  Soon, more  cohesive thoughts!

       VACATION, SMATION I am on vacation and had the bright idea to try to see various members of my family in asundry places. It's hard to spend enough time with everyone, you know, especially the ones that you really want to see.  I either need to live closer (contemplating that) or more vacation resources... ae time AND money. (go figure!) I went to my cousin's house in nowhere, VA first.  It's a super cool 150 yr old house that of course in his infinite spare time he fixes up.  It's coming along quite nicely (I think) and it's a beautiful space.  Plus, the history of the neighborhood is impressive (esp for America).  Even though he lives in Cowville, he has amazing friends that are sincerely GOOD people... hard to find in this day and age. His brother, myself and his friends ran him ragged all weekend, I hope that he was able to get his stuff done b4 work this am. Now, I am at my sister's, also in VA.  I really should have kept the kids today but by the time I had sort of come to this conclusion, mom had them packed off to daycare already. I don't think that I am going to do anything but hang out here anyway.  I just want to chill.  Plus I was up till 2 hanging out with a buddy of hers.  He must be hating work today! Ah, back to sleep for me, for the moment.  I will spoil myself with a mid-morning nap.  I wonder if I can start doing this at work? We'll find out when I get back next week.

       It is late, and although I am tired, I am too keyed up to go to bed. I have a big day of work, and travel ahead of me.  It's my vacation, and I am just going to see family (well not just...), but still I am hyped. I have packed, and of course it is after midnight as I type, there are, of course, things that only can be done in the am... that bathroom stuff.  I need to wake up early, but here I sit, typing away at the computer, inexplicably. There are, of course, things that I could do.  Perishables in the fridge, yeah, I suppose that the tuna won't last 10 days, do you?  Or that lime... or the basil, and thyme.  Maybe if I can keep this group of plants alive I can rationalize fresh herbs outside on the balcony. And the cats have already created a fur duplicate of themselves on the rug.  They will have another before my friend comes to actually stay the night and sit with them.  So, I could vacuum. MMmmmm, the longer that I think about it, the sleepier I grow.  Perhaps THAT is why I am tapping away at the computer.

       SOCIAL CLUBS FOR SINGLES THAT ACT AS IF WE DON'T WANT TO MEET OTHER SINGLES, MEMORIAL DAY DRINKING AND THE LIKE Hope that everyone had a safe, drink-filled Memorial Day as I did... Of course, water play was on my agenda, as was sun, and of course a primarily liquid diet...   I achieved all, including a bit of a burn as well.  That is sunburn... for all that were confused. I belong to several social clubs, as do we all.  I am single, my life is filled with events, friends, work, and of course, my two beloved children, I mean, my cats. I am on the board of a particular club that deems itself "not a single's club". Ok, we AREN'T a singles club, but we sure have a lot of single members. About 98.9% to be accurate.  And even if they are not single... they aren't the committed, stay at home and become boring married/boyfriend/girlfriend types.   The officers board, well particular members, bristle at the thought of this... and unfortunately, it comes up in every officers meeting. I know just as much as EVERYONE else, that we all have interests, and things that we want to participate in without the day to day pressures of having to meet, potentially, the opposite sex. (yeah right!) *And really, don't we DO things that we are interested in and hope that we will meet OTHERs that like to do those things and GEE!??? isn't it a bonus if they are attractive? and someone we would like to "hang out with more" (to coin the latest phrase for DATING, but not DATING) So, it's hysterical if we try to promote anything that may seem "singles" oriented... however, our monthly social is much of a trolling fest for the opposite sex... old and new members alike.  Perhaps in their minds, our social is the only "singles" type of event that they want to deal with? Please, talk amongst yourselfs... and COMMENT!

       WOW! I finally had the opportunity to check out the speech that was all the buzz from the Democratic Convention on Tuesday night.&nbsp;  I didn't get to see him deliver this speech, but reading it alone impressed me. Check it out, the "blessed" skinny kid, Barack Obama...  urlLink http://www.dems2004.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=luI2LaPYG&b=125925&amp;ct=158769

       BLOGUS INTERRUPTUS I was on my computer, in my bedroom, when I heard a loud thud. The cats were taking their morning perch on the balcony.  It's a favored spot by the kittens, as they get to peruse the neighborhood for bugs and other wayward creatures. When I went to the balcony, I discovered my smallest, the 8 pounder, who looks like a rat wet, had a bird about her size in her mouth.   "Let it go, drop that!" kept coming out of my mouth to no avail. Fortunately, the bird was granted freedom, lest some feathers when Picollo tried to leap off the chair to carry her trophy over into the corner. My hunter!

       It all started rather innocently, a few friends getting together for a drink and some birthday cake. The candles were blown out, the gifts were given, the cake was consumed, and then there was more. The birthday boy wanted to go out, and the crowd could do not but follow.  Granted this is generally the moment that I am backing to the door, giving my goodbyes, time to go home and rest, it's a school night you know! However, that moment came, passed, and I found myself driving to The Compound, that new club over by NST that blocks up their parking ya know...(mentioned in a previous post)  Every night at this club is different, and this was no exception, it was a predominantly gay crowd. Immediately, I and my other friend were separated from the pack... it seems that we are "breeders". (non-gays for all you folks in the burbs...)  This did not deter us, we still of course went in, and immediately to the bar.  The club is not only huge, but extremely cool, several buildings, several courtyards, a fountain (that later had our stinky feet in it!), and an amazing room/outer building that is strictly the dance floor. This rooms ceiling is covered with speakers and flat panel screens on every wall, practically covering it.  So, we danced. And danced.  And suddenly I caught movement out of my right eye. A guy had just PUSHED someone over in my general direction. I quickly spun the other way but this guy propelled towards me, and just grabbed my hands. He was direct and simple in his questions, "Do you want to dance?" to which I nodded yes. Then, "are you straight?", to which I also nodded yes, then unexplicably, the words came tumbling from my mouth, "You're hot!"  I think at that point you could say that I was sufficiently buzzed.  So, we danced!  My friends watched on laughing... the smile so broad on my face that it could barely be contained.  My dancer left to get a drink, his friends came over to help? offer advice? dance? and said two words that every woman wants to hear, "He's drunk!"  Really? is that why he is bouncing around like a top and waving his arms above his head like a future Chipendale dancer?  Fortunately, I was able to get back to seriously shaking my tail feather without further delay, or interruption.  Later, I grabbed my dancer for another spin.  He was 22 and a Tech student, OUCH!  Approached by Michelle, I was informed that the party was breaking up and said that some people were going to stay so I could also...  "No, I think I am ready to go..." I said, and made quick, polite goodbyes to my dancer and his entourage.  I woke up still on a dancing high, which, I am happy to say, I still have!  *No cradles were robbed on this evening.

       BUT, I KNOW I'M SPECIAL! Seriously, I am, I know that deep down in this little corner crevice of my lil' ole heart...  However, when I had an odd phone call today and found out that someone had been using my last name and phone # for a credit application (and let's hope that is ALL that there was... a report from Equifax should provide further details in 7-10 days), I realized that I am as likely as the next girl to have someone commit credit card fraud on her! Maybe you haven't noticed before, but as far as things go, I'm an idealist.  You're good, you get good.  Capiche?  Call me Pollyanna, but this has been my general attitude in life.  (and no, it's not like I waggle down a darkened street with bad men lurking about to see granny at midnight or something stupid... I have SOME common sense ((not where men are concerned but that's different right?))) I am terrified if this (the phone #, coincidental last name, etc) is NOT the end of this... and I have already done the appropriate "FRAUD ALERT" thru Equifax which will pass along to the other two major credit authorization companies, so now I wait and see... For all of those out there that HAVEN'T  checked your credit report recently, it's free once a year at least. There are for some reason, STILL many evil people out there that would rather take a ride on your train than their own.  (your train is prettier after all!)   I suppose that part of what every person needs to figure out is what to hold out and what to hold in, because not all people are nice.

       I FOUGHT THE ALARM CLOCK, BUT I WON! Thursday evening turned out to be decidedly much longer than I had actually planned it to be... I wanted to be home and on the couch by 11... so that I could be productive on Friday! WRONG! An out of town friend coerced me into going to some/any Blues establishment available for music,and of course, beer. Willie's did not have anything recognizable, or fun, so I suggested a quick stop at Northside Tavern and perhaps Fuzzy's if it did not pan out (not knowing WHAT was going on there...) NST it was, a good band too, which we later found out to be the Breeze Kings... who I highly recommend. The evening here began with two excellent forecasters... no cover, and I did not have to pay exorbitant rates to park! As we sat and screamed conversation over the loud, live band only 5 feet away... I suddenly noticed a regular performer at NST over my friends left shoulder... It was none other than Sean Costello!  I was delighted and surprised! Congregating with him were a few friends, a female (who by his wandering hands I can only assume to be his date?  girlfriend?), and another gentleman that I discovered to be part of the Electromatics!   As the evening progressed, beers were had, music was listened to, and eventually, Sean and his friends jammed out with the Breeze Kings.  I was, as I mentioned before, delighted. My out of town friend, who, from Nashville, seems to be more up on the Atlanta blues scene than I, also introduced me to a lovely lady by the name of Lola!  (yes, L-O-L-A, Lola!)  She is purportedly an awesome piano player, who also has a band named (but of course!) Lola!  I intend to find out where her next performance is, and I will give you a full review! No evening would be complete without a late night bfast at Waffle House (which in its greasiness, was of course, consumed, in it's entirety!), and then homeward to bed! I slept in of course, and my alarm clock, and my kittens, lost their battle with me to awake!

       MORE ABOUT MY DAY I had the oportunity to see my fave, not sure if I have really talked about him before... but his name is Sean, Sean Costello.  A lot of my friends lived through the obsession that I have had with this man and his music (or was it just him?), and thankfully, a few of them are still around. He plays over at Northside Tavern, a dive bar with occasional good music.  (oh and that is in ATLANTA, GA) Unfortunately, this area has been taken over by a new club that I haven't been too, but I liken it to a sort of removed Buckhead or Midtown because tonight... I actually had to PAY to park.  I used to be a regular at NST, so I am not even accustomed to paying COVER... it's almost a foreign word to me... yet tonight was different.  NOT ONLY did I not find a place to park, so, I actually had to PAY TO PARK, but the bouncer that knows me wasn't at the door and I HAD TO PAY COVER.  I was completely offended, but I figure, it  probably all works out somehow right? Sean was there in regular form, I wish that my Mac could publish pixs, because I have 2-10.  Ok, I will be the first (not really), to admit that maybe, possibly, I am not entirely over him... but he has one "fine set of pipes" on him according to even my best friends boyfriend... who almost forgave me (not entirely, I believe that he used the term STALKER) for my obsession with Sean.  (yes, I think at this point I can call him Sean.)   Anyway, it was a great end to my evening to be able to see him perform for a little while.  I even had the opportunity to dance up front with my friend which was fabulous except for the GWH, or to be more specific GWLH. *GWH Girl with hair *GWLH Girl with long-ass hair Unfortunately this girl wanted to share her long hair with the world (including beating my best friend with her hair).  Perhaps she had too much to drink or something... but we are both of the opinion that she herself was a devotee of  Sean... she knew every lyric to every song.  His new album purportedly will be out October 1st. CHECKITOUT!

       WHAT A DAY, WHERE DO I BEGIN? I suppose first, I want to address the issue to the men out there... hey! if we aren't supposed to be the aggressor... the woman that is, HOW do we let you know that we are interested?  I mean, to clarify, I have tried the hair flipping, the smiling, laughing at all the jokes approach with this man and somehow... he just DOESN'T SEEM to GET THE POINT. Granted, we know each other through a business situation AND, I am old enough (but not that old), to know that it just doesn't mix... the whole biz/pleasure kind of thing.  HOWEVER... this is one person in quite a while that I am honestly interested in.   I have friends that say, "ask him for coffee" or "send him an email" or both of the above.   But, I get back to the point, the point that women SHOULDN'T BE THE AGGRESSOR and I stumble... or I would have probably already asked him out.   I can go off for many paragraphs on "living in the moment" "never having regrets" "be true to your emotions" again, it hasn't always been prudent.  This is the cause for my overly hesitant self... which I am generally not at all.  So, I beg the question... HOW DO I PROCEED???????

       MY SWEET, DEAR SISTER, BLESS HER HEART! Do you have wacky family?  Weird uncle? maybe an odd cousin?   My family is one of those that other relatives probably concern themselves if WE are coming to the reunion, but seriously... At first glance we are quite normal.   My sister however, doesn't appear normal.  Her hair is died, bleached and can be seen from a distance of at least three miles on a clear day.  She's a sensationalist like Madonna, but not in a profit oriented way.  (by the way, have you gotten a look at her new children's books?  She's just moving right along with her fans...) Things that my sister obsesses over when I see her are 1) our parents divorce that ended so long ago (his new wife and he have been married for 25 yrs) 2) what my dad is up to, why hasn't he called every hour on the hour, is he mad at her for something? 3) rehashing old family drama. Currently, she was just fired from her job.  She claims that they didn't really give her a reason... don't they ALWAYS give a reason?  Not that I wish to see her out of her job, but it is reassuring that someone else finds her as perfectly annoying as I do. Psycho sis, to get attention, frequently turns a situation into more than what it is.  For instance... when she was younger she accused my dad of abusing her.  We eventually found out that the only reason she said this was because he had paid too much attention to our step-sister. She's also the kind of person that ALWAYS stands behind the wrong argument, not really listening to what the entire thing is about.  She just walks in, doesn't listen and picks a side because so and so said so, or perhaps she liked the way that they styled their hair that day. The current situation is this:  My mother, who has driven my grandmother into debt on more than one occasion (and once into bankruptcy), has seemingly, dipped her hand into grandma's coffers again. Drama ensues, and the last thing I have heard about it was from my Psycho Sis, telling me that Grandma is being VERY DISRESPECTFUL to our mother, and that our mother had chest pains and would call me when she calmed down.  (because of course she's NOT guilty, right?) Again, picking the right side of the argument, my sis.  I suppose yes, of course, my grandmother should still pay the way for her MARRIED, 60-something, daughter, right?  Self-centered bitches, bless their hearts!

       EXPERTS How do experts get their experience?  THROUGH SCREWING UP! I am in the middle of the entire "wow, that was a dumbass move!" moment in my life. I suppose that everyone goes through them from time to time again. I try to look at it positively, you know, "the glass is full!"  *that is until I dump it! No seriously, sometimes you have to just keep on smiling, even though you know your first instinct was wrong.  It has been a rough couple of weeks trying to maintain positive imagery of "my life". New experiences though, are good, learning is good, mistakes mean that we are doing something (not just sitting on our buttkiss!) Does anyone see the smoke coming out of these ears? Something must be working up there!

       IMPRESSED This day couldn't have been better... well, of course, mostly! I had my first test... not too bad after the many years of no test taking. I finally got the counter to work on this site! I found out that someone else actually READ and COMMENTED on my blog other than Olen and Leah (who's comments by the way I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE!)  It was just cool, someone not directly connected by blogdom, read MY blog.   It was probably some sort of freak occurence... somehow his computer linked up to floating velocity.blogspot.com  maybe he has a pet gerbil that jumped out of the cage and tap danced randomly on the keys...  do investment bankers have pet gerbils?  and hot girlfriends named Jaz? Naw!  probably not!  Doesn't really fit the scenerio does it? Thanks Jay!  for stopping by, even if it was only the one time... see how you have made my day? :)

       WELL, SOME OF THE CONCLUSION I have learned a few things over the last few days... It appears that most of my family is REPUBLICAN. It appears that many of my friends are DEMOCRAT. And both sides are staunchly so. With the democrats, I ask certain questions. And with the republicans, I ask others. Some give great answers, others information that I just don't buy. I have read web-sites of information on the movie and Moore's facts. And I'll I have found is that Moore states his newspaper quotes, or items from the news online. And the others site still other sources. It was actually quite exhausting. So, not that you are dying to know... But I am still thinking about it. I have come to one definite conclusion.  The war in Iraq is bad, it's too bad that we made that decision, because now we are stuck there, it's going to be a while before we get out of that place.  People on both sides are dying and more is developing behind it.

       Information! Information! In my quest for more information on the Michael Moore film, I found this website http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm.  (prob not a live link may need to do some cut and paste!) Interesting rebuttal in any event... more soon!

       MICHAEL MOORE AND BUSH BASHING GALORE! Sadly, as most people find this out about me they are disapointed.  But, because of the way that I was raised, I have sucessfully stayed away from politics most of my life.  There are things that I definitely have opinions about... like the entire Clinton/Lewinsky thing.  Who cares?  All the presidents have mistresses!  Now we've just let an entire generation of young kids think that oral sex... isn't really sex.  (yeah right!)  It's just "Clinton sex".  Good thing that I don't have kids, I'd hate to have to sit down with my teenage son and daughter and try to explain that one! The class that I am taking... yeah, the Philosophy one, uses alot of the politics going on today for debate in class.  It's all about the "right" kinds of arguments vs "wrong" ones.  Not a big news flash to anyone, but apparently... we've all argued the wrong way for centuries!  You AREN'T SUPPOSED to pull on people's heartstrings using different diversionary tactics... or are you? So, we received an extra credit assignment, to see Fahrenheit 911, do a summary of it, and draw some conclusions about whether rhetoric was good or bad in this case. The Republicans do it, did Michael Moore do it in his movie?  Obviously a democrat, if you haven't seen the movie already. I have never seen a Michael Moore movie, I tried desperately to get ANYONE to go with me.  The one guy R, who would have gone, got tied up at work.  People were either, Moore is slanting to the bleeding heart liberals... or I wish there was a more libertarian approach to government.  So, I went by myself.  (which I don't mind, however I generally try not to go on a weekend NIGHT, and appear so incredibly by myself... but I was desperate to get this assignment done for class.) I had heard alot about the movie and wanted to try to be completely objective about everything that was presented to me.  Unfortunately, I was unable to do that.  Probably due to the fact that I have a serious lack of knowledge on alot of the points that were made in the film.   I found myself on an emotional rollercoaster, probably just what Moore intended.  I don't fault him for that at all, I just didn't appreciate being forced there by his extreme presentation.  He showed the many affects of the war on both the American people and Iraqi's.  He showed footage of an Iraqi man waving the body of a dead child in the camera, asking the question "Did this child harm you?"  Next more images, including one that was particularly haunting... an extremely young child with their arm completely exposed to the bone.  Next an American mother, who lost her son when his helicopter went down in Iraq.  She reads his last letter to her, expressing his anger with Bush, how he felt that the soldiers were in Iraq for nothing.  Then American soldiers getting injured, feet blown off, hands blown off.  And then, a meeting in America with alot of companies plotting how they could profit from "new" business in Iraq. As I mentioned, I do have a lack of knowledge when it comes to these things and I was quite surprised  by the relationship that the Bush family has with the Bin Laden family.  The Carlyle group, that profited so heavily in the days after 9/11.  How the Bin Laden was allowed to leave the country without even being questioned by the authorities at all.  (a lovely Dragnet sequence in there also...) They show the administration alternately showing in the months leading up to the war that Saddam Hussein had no access to Weapons of Mass Destruction, posed no threat, it was "under control".  But then immediately following 9/11 how he suddenly had all of these things.   Next the reports from within the FBI/CIA about terrorists being in the country, learning how to fly airplanes... and the reports being ignored. Next came the lack of effort made to actually GET Osama Bin Laden.  How long it took for special forces to even get the opportunity to go after the man, MONTHS.  And then showing Bush publicly stating that Osama wasn't a huge concern for him, that he doesn't even think about him.  This is the man that claimed responsiblity to the 9/11 atttacks, and we didn't go after him?  our president doesn't think about him?  WHY NOT???!!!!! This movie made me sick to my stomach.  I didn't know who to be more ashamed of, Bush, for all of the acts that he has done, his close connection with profiting from his actions, his definite "good ole boy" network, the vendetta that he had against Iraq from the word "go", and his ties with the Saudis. Or with Michael Moore, for presenting all these facts in a very popular movie.  Sometimes in such a schlocky way that it pissed me off.  (The referrals to "Bonanza" were highly entertaining.)  And I found myself laughing right along with the crowd.   I came out worried about my country.  If electing someone else would actually MAKE it better or worse.  By now, we do not have much choice about our troops staying in Iraq.  The American people have definitely made an impression on the country, and not always positively.  Again, not trying to sound too ignorant, but in Time just a week ago, an article discussed how certain groups in Iraq want the Americans to leave so that the entire country can become a breeding ground for terrorists. We did fund these groups in the past, us, America.  Perhaps not by popular choice, but by administration choice.  So, in a sense, haven't we empowered them?  And by trying to clean up our mess we have gotten ourselves in even a bigger one.  Because now there isn't a "safe" way for us to pull out of this situation. I have people that I love in the military.  Yes, it was their choice to defend their country.  But, I don't want them to get hurt.  I don't want anyone to get hurt.  And the violence mounts in Iraq with each passing day. As I mentioned before, I am sick to my stomach, anyone have any Tums?

       GETTING FIRED UP! I really thought that this year would be somewhat tame, my "birthday month" seems to always start early and go on a little later than most.  It's the time of year that I indulge myself, treat myself, and do things more often than I normally do the rest of the year. This year, as I mentioned, I thought would be pretty low key, no plans for a party, and lots of my friends in different locations.   On my home from the movies with my friend K, we picked up the loaf and I did the first thing that I always did, read my horriblescope!  (they are truly funny in the loaf and generally make no sense whatsoever...)  Allow me to share, because this one is a classic! "In accordance with the astrological omens, I've assembled a host of snappy one-liners for you to wield in the coming week.  Sooner or later, it will make sense for you to utter every one of them.  1) "It only seems kinky the first time."  2) "Even if the voices in my head aren't real, they still have some good ideas."  3) "To make your prayers come true, you have to get off your knees."  4) "I'm the good kind of bad."  5) "It's not really a party till something gets broken." 6) " Shut up and dance." (PS  I don't anticipate there'll be any messy consequences if you cultivate the attitude I'm suggesting here.  But in case there ar, invoke this disclaimer:  "I didn't do it.  You can't prove it.  Nobody saw me.") Oddly enough, I have uttered more than one of these on several occasions... Why is this such a classic?  Because it got me all fired up to make a point of enjoying myself on my birthday... which will be a little hard to do as I have to go to work, and class, and study for a test! I'm off to get in trouble...  "I didn't do it, you can't prove it, nobody saw me."

       THANK GOD FOR FRIENDS Today, I woke up in the worst mood.  I am not even sure why.  I had an extremely low-key weekend with cousins and their family/extended families.  I had lots to eat, drink, saw a movie and even excercised.  Upon arriving home, I ate my favorite meal of steamed dumplings and masaman chicken... half, so that I could have some today.  I even got my homework done EARLY!!!!! However, when I arose from slumber... I tucked my head back into the blankets and immediately tried to think of reasons NOT to go to work today. I was FOUL from the word, "Good AM!"   And barely wanted to discuss our little vacation with anyone at work. The mood extended, even though I desperately tried to avoid conflict, especially talking with anyone in general... Thank god for my neighbor over at http://www.propellerskies.com for coming all the way across the parking lot, lugging liquor, to make me a special tequila drink that I found tasty... but don't recall the name to.   He cheered me up and thankfully, unlike most, and a welcome change...didn't ask me why.  I didn't have to even attempt to explain WHY.  (when normally I would want to!) Instead, we decided important matters, like his new status as Godfather to Mello Frisco, a recent four-legged resident of my apartment.  Yep, he'll be there to spin tales for him like any father would, and of course, encourage drinking... (actually Mello is apparently a non-drinker, although he does indulge in catnip from time to time). We also had to rag on the gentleman that was ragging on the new up and coming models on some stupid tv show...showing truly the brains behind supermodels! Thanks for making me smile! I am glad to know that I have good friends!

       THE WORST KIND OF GIRL? My entire life, I've never considered myself a girls girl.  You know, the one that obsesses over nails, hair, clothes.  The girl that wants the top in the convertible up, because it would mess up her hair, blow it into her lipstick.  The girl where things have to match, she can't go camping because she wouldn't necessarily be able to use a hairdryer, the kind that can't bring under TWO big suitcases with her whereever she goes! I'm pretty laid back, I drive with my windows open, make-up minimal... hair must take 10 mins or less it fails the haricut test, clothes... non-obsessive.  It's getting weird though... is this the another sign of aging?  I have developed a shoe fetish, a purse fetish... and most recently, I think the worst kind of fetish.... JEWELRY. I have never spent more than $90 on any kind of jewelry.  And that was once, because they were just SO unique. But, I made the mistake one night of going into Tiffany's.  I know, I know... the worst kind of jewelry store right?  But, have you ever BEEN IN THERE?  I hate to sound shallow, and like, the worst kind of girl, but the shiny things really excited me.  Diamonds, platinum, it was all very pretty.  I was especially fascinated when I got to try a pair of earrings on that cost about as much as an extremely economical car.  I probably haven't spent that much on clothes my entire life... maybe shoes, but... there was just some kind of electric energy about something that was so extremely impractical.   I feel like the chick in that movie... you know the one where when she gets the "mean reds", she goes to Tiffany's, because you just can't be depressed in there... you know, if I feel glum, I just swing over to their website! http://www.tiffany.com/  Have fun!

       FREEDOM, WELL ALMOST...  I think I am back into the school mode again, finally, and oddly enough tomorrow is the last day of summer semester.  What a class to start with, Philosophy and Critical Thinking.  Oddly, it was supposed to be the "easy" course, the school required one, where the teacher reads the book during the class course... except for of course, MY TEACHER.  He is/was the born philosopher, and for him the interesting part of the class is the debate part, and the part were we talk about different philosophers, and write PAPERS on them.   OOOOH! AAAHHHHH!    So, I'm thrilled (sort of but not really), however... he did actually awaken the old synapses where I actually had to form THOUGHTS and GOD FORBID! opinions.  And I am inspired to continue in my "let's take some college classes and see if I can actually make them into a bachelors degree" process, and I signed up for some more classes.  So, now, everyone (and Roger, you're exempt because I already know how you feel, and thanks for all of your assistance with this last paper, even if you didn't quite agree with my final conclusion!).... how do YOU feel about existentialism?  In short, (if you wanted my opinion), I thought that man needed some sort of value system as a back up.  Sartre fights against religion alot, so I made alot of religious reference in my paper... but I think that I am more in tune with the combination of it and virtue ethics.  In thinking about this material, I realized that I had been raised Christian,  and even if I had abandoned that faith, there was still alot going on in my brain in the background about the "shalt not lie" type of thing... (yes, Roger, another long sentence comma nightmare... but I think that this is just the way my brain actually runs things together... frightening isn't it?)

       INTERESTING FACTOID Did you know that Georgia is the worst in the nation for people going to the polls to vote?  The state is ranked usually in the 49, or 50 slot. Judging though, by the majority of comments I get and see on other people's blogs... they wouldn't vote anyway, because they don't like any of the choices that are offered. It's sad to think that we are a free nation, and do have the ability to vote and have some say in the way that our government is run, but people are too jaded to actually do it.  They think that the polls are rigged, all politicians are crooks, and that it won't make a difference anyway.

       we pause for this blogging moment... I am doing anything that I possibly can to NOT study for my final on Wednesday OR finish a paper that I also have due on the same day... I am wondering, with my summer daze going on, how I will make it this fall when I will be taking MORE classes? MADNESS, I surmise.

       NEW LAW:  ALL AMERICANS HAVE TO SPEND AT LEAST ONE YEAR IN A CUSTOMER SERVICE RELATED ACTIVITY  Dealing with the public is both challenging and miserable all at the same time.  How many of you out there waited tables in college or high school?  worked fast food?  maybe a retail environment?  Oh, come on, raise your hands, it's nothing to be ashamed of.  Work is good, any kind, and all experiences are all good, right? (ok, a little Pollyanna here, however, I am a big LEMONADE kind of girl... so work with me!) Have you ever heard the phrase, "the customer is always right!"  The answer class, is "NO! The customer is sometimes living on the other side of reality, the one in which they are a dictator and you are their servant, and THIS IS NOT REALITY!!!"  Let me re-iterate, "THIS IS NOT REALITY!" I know that even more people would go on Prozac if they really had the opportunity to get a full taste of what dealing with the public is like.  Anyone can be patient for a while, no really, they can.  Try to extend that for a full 8 hour day.  Then a few days in a row.  Next lets book on into a week, followed by a month or a year.   You too can be yelled at for not returning an item that the customer has obviously used, and had for SIX months, AND scratched up beyond belief..."But I never used it, I swear!" And when you succumb, you too can be yelled at for giving them significantly less than full credit. Do you, as a customer, honestly think that when you order something from a store that it is actually the person at the counters fault for it not arriving exactly when they were told it was?  Couldn't it potentially be a UPS problem?  or a manufacturing issue?  a backorder issue?  (The people in front of you actually  do not MAKE the product, no really, it's true!) In brief conclusion, I don't care that you have had a bad day, don't take it out on me. I don't care that you are upset because you waited until the last minute to buy something that you know that you have needed for months and now not only do I not have any more, but it's just too fucking late to get it to you anyway. I have absolutely no control over what the manufacturer actually sends us.  Yes, we may have it on order, but someone from that company has actually got to send it to us before we can sell it to you, the lucky customer. Your customer service rep is there to give you that personal touch, and information you wouldn't get from a recording device or possibly understand from the description on the box.  There is no reason to be rude to a person who is honestly trying to help you.  *And if there is, perhaps you should be looking for help with someone else... like a therapist! (*Maybe customer service helps you most in an early political career, because it teaches you all about repetition, because frequently, people have many of the same questions.)
