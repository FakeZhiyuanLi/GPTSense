      it's monday and i'm back at work. as usual i walk into my office open the blinds, flick the switch on my little pink fan that belonged to my grandmother who died in 1999. we called her grandma bird because we had to distinguish her from the other two grandmothers we had at the time. she was the lucky one. she had doves so of course her name was grandma bird. my parent's names are grandma and grandpa fritz. fritz because that is the name of their dog. i'm not sure they appreciated it at the time but now they are used to it. they used to be called grandma and grandpa trailer because they lived in a trailer but by the time my son was born they were no longer living in a trailer and needed a new name. my other grandma and grandpa were named grandma and grandpa with the dog. it's kind of like that movie by kevin costner and the native americans and he was a soldier. anyway...the girl's name was stand with a fist. this is similar. so anyway my grandparent't dog died so we changed their names to grandma and grandpa country since they lived on the outskirts of town. but now they are just grandma and grandpa. our family doesn't do those normal names for grandparents...ma maw, pa pa, etc. that's just not us. but back to my daily routine. i check my email, the local papers, msn slate, davezilla, dooce,&nbsp;the high sign, and some others depending on the day of the week. sounds like a lot of things to do but it really doesn't take me that long. it definitely puts off the starting of the work day which is ALWAYS good! speaking of work i better get to it...

      i just filled out my profile. i hate doing those things. i have had aol for almost a decade and have yet to get any farther on my profile other than the "what sex are you?" question. seems that no matter what i put down it doesn't portray the real me. i know me and i can't see me when i look at my profile. maybe it is my word choice. maybe it's that my profile is really me and it scares me what a  dork  i am!

      This is my first time doing this blog thing. Is that disrespectful of all the serious bloggers to call it "this blog thing"? Probably. I hate to think that is how this is going to start out. Haven't yet decided what the purpose of this is going to be. Seems silly to&nbsp;treat it as&nbsp;a personal diary that everyone in the world has the ability to see. Not that anyone will. I'm not going to be that self involved to think people are pining away googling my name for blogs I'm involved with. That is scary. Have you ever googled yourself? Not in the lock your door and pray no one comes knocking type of googling either. I googled myself for the first time a couple of years ago and the only thing that came up that was associated with me was a student government I was involved with in college. I thought that was close enough to home and didn't want to see anymore!
