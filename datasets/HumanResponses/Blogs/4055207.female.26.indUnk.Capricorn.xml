      Peter came home today. It was a suprise. He hurt his eye and had to take a few days off and put drops in his eye so he came home to us. It was nice to see him but he's acting so out of it he's driving me nuts. He said it's because of the painkillers but I don't think so since all I gave him was ASPIRIN!. The problem is that his mind is still on work not on home. I don't care how much he makes working there. I don't know if I can stand it much more. On another note the crazy neighbor downstairs with the psychotic son decided that she was going to fence off the common lawn and make it exclusively hers. The fact that she thinks this is ok adds proof to the theory I have that she is crazy. I can't wait to move. Only one and a half months left here. Woo hoo! - Briana

      I am reading the book Red Tent by Anita Diamont and as a woman reading this book I can't help thinking about menstrual cycles and that of course has me thinking about my cycle. Which leads us back to my first period. Growing up in the type of family that I did we didn't know much about the mechanics of the body or how the two bodies interlock to&nbsp;create babies. Well, if we&nbsp;did know something we acted like we didn't. When I was in fourth grade I&nbsp;started developing and it wasn't long until my Mother noticed too. I don't know what she was thinking but one day when I was lying on my bed kicking back to some New Kids On The Block she threw a pamphlet at me and said you should read this and then she ske-dattled out of there quickly. The Pamphlet was called Julie's Story. Do any of you guys know what I am talking about? Well, it was terrible and after I read that I was shocked and more than a little disgusted. But the moral of this story is don't give your daughter a pamphlet and call it good. Start telling them things bit by bit so they don't get hit with all this information all at once. And make sure it is celebrated. If you don't know what I mean read The Red Tent. That's all I have to say... Goodnight

       Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Whoever made that up was lacking a few crucial brain cells. Sometimes I feel like I am waiting continuosly for the next step of my life. Maybe it's the rain and maybe it's hormones but when you have&nbsp;so much time on your hands you tend to be melancholy. I live three-thousand miles from family. Five hours from my husband. I never realised how little I have in common with most people until I tried to make friends.&nbsp;I really want friends but I can't seem to find anyone who shares a love of John Steinbeck and Simon and&nbsp;Garfunkel. I am twenty-six.&nbsp;All the girls my age&nbsp;are so obsessed with&nbsp;the dumnest things.&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't know what to do. I feel like I am so alone and everytime I try to make friends with people I&nbsp;get stabbed in the back. I seem to have this concept of morals and accountibility that has gone out of vogue when I wasn't looking. Women are so catty. I&nbsp;am too straight- forward.&nbsp;Does anyone else ever feel this way?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
