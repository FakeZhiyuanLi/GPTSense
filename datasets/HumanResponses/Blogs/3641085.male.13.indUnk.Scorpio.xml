      Okay..Today, morning...After the test, PE..which suxs...Needed to do various torturing exercises...Sianz...Then lessons juz went on as usual...And it was raining the whole dae...And another thing,during 2nd recess..Kim tien and Alvin was juz talking crap..("thks" arhz, Huiying...). And after school, we were supposed to have training, but it was raining.... I think that's a blessing in disguise...We then won't be using our energy,which is needed for the match tomorrow...And most of us thought that we would be going home..But instead, we have some theory lessons in class...And Mr yo juz talked till 5 something....And then, Mrlim asked us to go home and rest...But several of us still went to the field to practise some throws...And I suppose Zai, ZY and me went home earlier..And on the way, Zai put GS's glove in yanlin's bag...It wasn't much fun though...He told him soon after we got out of the sch...If he's gonna do that, he should not have pit it in her bag in the first place....And took bus back lahz....But alighted one stop b4 where I was supposed to be alighting...There are two reasons why I did that...Firstly, many ppl was about to board, and that makes my alighting difficult..And the second reason is that I have to get my newpaper.....And that's all todae....Sigh...Arghz....Tomorrow have history.....Sianz........................................................................................................................................................(Feeling real stupid)

Sighs...Monday is the match against RI and zuan ming juz called to say that he injured his knee after falling down this morning and may not be able to play...I suppose either sec1s, sl, or chong lip will have to play 1st base if he really can't play....And of all these ppl, I only trust SL to be able to play 1st base well...Sighs...After sports meet, went to eat and then went back to bedok cc to play bball....After that, went back to primary sch lahz...Coz they todae open-hse??? And then...came home lohz....Then I was listening and watching the Bee Gees....Then fell asleep on the bed....And woke up at 5...And then went downstairs to play soccer wif zach and chang song....Then played against some pros and several primary 6 students, all whom I knew.... And scored several gosls, as I always do...Those were juz the routine goals...All which I was used to scoring not really special goals todae....Sighs....But scored quite a few whatsoever...Sighs.....And now, becoz of playing soccer juz now and bball in the afternoon, Very tired......Sighs......Tomorrow...Mum not gonna be at home the whole dae, juz left my brother and me...Sianz....And have loads of work and have ting xie too...Sianz....And found out todae that we are leaving at 11.30 on monday coz it's RI we are going to...Dun really see the big deal abt playing RI...The key players in the team are injured....Sianz......Sighs......That's all, I suppose......................[Exploding with thoughts]

Sighs....And then...That's all for tuesday....And that leaves...todae....juz like the two daes b4, it is still a sch dae.....Morning...Form teacher interaction... and then eng, science, history, maths, recess....Then art....The teacher in the lab didn't believe that the egg I brought was empty.....And then came enrichment.....That teacher juz gave sweets away, and I actually only asked for two and she gave me one more...Saying that I answered more than two.....But I dun really care abt those sweets...So juz gave them away lahz.......And then assembly.....And after that, went bak to class...And was reading my soccer magazines while waiting for zm and kt...who were under the guidance of ms kartini....And the grp of girls were juz gathered at the corner doing what girls did best......And then....Went to play bball after that....Played outside the sch....and I juz left earlier, tot of studying.....But...came bak and slept till 7.45...And now, haven read the science notes yet....But finished maths le.....And Dad's coming bak later....And so.....That's all and it's time to do some studying........

At least, I have a distant feeling that it isn't something without an answer...Words can't bring it out....And when there're actions, I doubt it would be quick enough........At least, there's a answer there???????But for now.It's still distant........................Sighs....
