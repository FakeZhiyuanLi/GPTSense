      i just want to add that i am even having dreams about this piece of shit.&nbsp; i have had at least two dreams about him losing, and those are just the ones i remember the next morning.&nbsp; he's invading our dreams and taking over our conciousness.  BEWARE  soon we will all be slaves to the mormon machine.

       has anybody been watching jeopardy?&nbsp; have you seen this guy?&nbsp; he's out of control!!!    &nbsp;  i am a jeopardy fanatic.&nbsp; i try to watch it everyday.&nbsp; i have the timer on my VCR set, for christ's sake.&nbsp; but i am getting very very tired of watching this piece of shit roll over the competition every single day.    &nbsp;  i hate him.&nbsp; i've hated him since the first day i saw him.&nbsp; and it's just gotten worse.&nbsp; and it continues to do so.&nbsp; yesterday he won the season finale.&nbsp; that means he'll be back at the beginning of next season.&nbsp; i can't take anymore ken jennings.&nbsp; the one bright spot is that he finally set a one day record, a task which he seemed determined not to do.&nbsp; but i guess when you enter final jeopardy with over $51,000, it's hard not to set a new record.    &nbsp;  personally I think he's been trained since birth for this.&nbsp; it's a grand conspiracy purported by the elders of the mormon church.&nbsp; ten percent of his million-plus dollars are going to the church, the church of ken jennings of latter-day saints.    &nbsp;  when, Lord, when will the jeopardy gods make him lose.&nbsp; when will they stop throwing softball opponents at him.&nbsp; when will they stop giving him movie catergories in double jeopardy?&nbsp; WHEN WHEN WHEN!!    &nbsp;  so for now, it's summer, and he's at home.&nbsp; i'm beginning to think it may be my mission in life to kill ken.&nbsp; the insanity must stop.

      okay, so i am supposed to let all of tim's "faithful readers" know that this is his girlfriend writing. i told him that he has no readers so it doesn't matter.&nbsp; shit, even  I  don't read his blogs.&nbsp;..&nbsp;anyway, now that that business is taken&nbsp;care of, i can get to the good stuff. haha. actually, i don't have any clue what the point of this is. tim asked me if i wanted to write in his blog and i thought, hey it could be fun.&nbsp; i am realizing now as i do this, however, that blogging is really egotistical (hmm, i don't like that word there but for now it's all i can think of). i mean, a bunch of people are 'out there' in that crazy huge void usually called "cyber space" typing away their thoughts.&nbsp; telling people about themselves.&nbsp; cataloguing their favorites--favorite movies, songs, books, whatever. immortalizing their mundane daily routines.&nbsp; "today i took the dog for a walk. she chased after a squirrel." i don't have a dog, but someone out there does and someone out there just wrote down for all the universe to know that their poodle chases squirrels from time to time. gee, how important do we all think our boring lives are that we keep online journals for everyone out there to read?&nbsp; okay, so maybe i am being a little too critical of this whole blogging thing.&nbsp; no harm is meant here,&nbsp;but i think that what  we  (you, the reader, and me, the writer) should at least think about what  we  are doing right now.&nbsp; i am writing down my thoughts and you are reading them.&nbsp; but it's more than that.&nbsp; a lot more that i don't care to elaborate on just because i am feeling lazy and this laptop is getting really hot. my final confession: i like the vanity in all of this. it feels good. like looking at myself in the mirror when i know i look HOT.

      so another day, another post.  when was the last one?  i don't know I've lost track already.  ah, well.  so today i decided i am going to quit my job.  too much bullshit and those fucks won't make me a server and i won't do it anymore.  i would have given my two weeks today if my boss hadn't given me a free lunch.  soon though.  i'm gonna get me a fun job, and move somewhere cool.  yes siree it will be fantastically sweet.  so that's the news for today.  all i have left to say is poop poop.

      See I went on a crazy kick...three entries in one day and then nothing for a day.  I wonder if anyone is even reading this.  If they are, maybe they would love it if I told something about myself.  Born and raised in the Commonwealth of Kentucky (one of only 4 states known as a commonwealth), I moved to Gainesville, Florida, the New Athens (georgia) of the south, when I was sixteen.  Finished high school, went to Tulane for a semester.  Came back to Gainesville to go to UF but really because I had a lying bitch of a girlfriend who was still here (was that bitterness subtle enough?).  Finished school last August and got my bachelor's degree in geology.  Since that time I have been working part-time at a restaurant, and basically wasting my life.  I'm making no money, I hate my job, I have no immediate prospects for the future.  My life is a big piece of shit for the past year.  The only redeeming thing is that I've gone on two, month-long trips, one to the American West, and one to Mexico, from Yucatan to Mexico city.  other than that I have nothing to show.  So as I mentioned previously, I'm starting to get desperate.  I need to do something, so maybe the thing to do is run back to grad school.  not for geology, though.  not for any science...although I find science fascinating, I don't believe I could perform under the rigorous guidelines that define any respectable science.  So at this point I am actually considering law school, which is the last thing I thought I would do.  But I can probably get into a good school.  And the rigor of the program might help me get my ass in gear.  Don't get me wrong, though.  I don't want to go to law school and work for some ambulence chaser or some corporate law firm.  I actually want to do environmental law, and maybe help the earth.  work for the sierra club or some other non government orginization.  Maybe this is a flawed plan, though.

      I LOVE TO BLOG BLOG BLOG BLOG.  That can be a verb, too, right?  christ what am I even doing up right now.  I need to go to bed.  I also need to give anyone who might be reading this (probably no one) a brief background of myself, but that will have to come later, because it is toooooo late.

      Wow two posts in one day and it's only the first day.  Or maybe it's  because  it's the first day.  I wrote an entry at work that I was gonna transcribe, but then I thought, "Can I do that?"  Is it bad form to think of blog entries when I'm not actually on the computer?  I don't know, so just to be safe I won't use it.  It was unexciting anyway.  Just bitching about my job.  For the information of any readers, I am a "bartender", but not a real one.  I don't get tips and I don't deal with customers.  My job sucks and it's a dead end.  That was the long and short of it.  So I need to get a real job.  It doesn't have to last forever, but it has to be full time, and last at least a year.  If anyone knows of one let me know.  I would like a job that lets me be in nature, or at least see interesting stuff, but I'm starting to get desperate.  Most of all I just need to get out of Florida.  And my lease ends at the end of July, so the pressure is on.  I'll keep you updated, Computer World

      So I guess this is it.  I have a blog.  I'm not good at keeping journals.  This is an established fact.  How will this one go?  I am on my way to work though, so we'll just have to wait to find out.
