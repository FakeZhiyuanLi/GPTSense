        5. Hit Stick -  Madden 2005   4. Playmaker Control -  Madden 2004  3. Hot Routes -  NCAA 2004  2. Home Field Advantage -  NCAA 2005  1.  The High Five -  Tecmo Bowl    I haven't actually played  Madden 2005  yet (soon...very soon), but from what I read the Hit Stick will be incredible. Playmaker Control is great for changing the direction of running plays and making receivers come back to the ball. Hot Routes were revolutionary. Home Field Advantage balanced out their power. But watching Willie Gault and Walter Payton slap hands made Tecmo Bowl the most fun game ever. Rock on  urlLink Tecmo .

        5. Jay Schroeder 4. Rob Johnson 3. Tony Banks 2. Danny Wuerffel  1. Heath Shuler    First of all, let me say that I was at the game where Lawrence Taylor forcibly passed the torch from Joe Theisman to Jay Schroeder. I'm actually glad I was there and not watching it on TV, because there were no replays in the stadium. We had no clue how bad Theisman's injury was. We also had no clue that it was the beginning of an era of unsteadiness at quarterback for the Redskins.  Jay Schroeder (besides having a phonetically incorrect name...) was not good. He wasn't good with the Redskins. He wasn't good with the Raiders. He wasn't even a good baseball player (just ask the Toronto Blue Jays).  Rob Johnson has a target on his back. Or he smells like pork chops. I'm not sure which, but big defensive lineman start salivating when they see him in a game.   As much of a target as he is, at least he usually holds onto the ball.  Unlike....  Tony Banks has 73 fumbles in 89 games.  Are you kidding me?  This guy's in the NFL?  Danny, Danny, Danny.  Small hands.  Wears a glove.  Has an arm like a Girl Scout.  Must have incriminating photos of Steve Spurrier.  That's the only possible explanation I can see for the OBC continually turning to him.   And what is there to say about Heath Shuler that hasn't already been said?  The third overall pick in the 1994 draft, between Marshall Faulk and Willie McGinnist.  His career numbers:  49.2% completion percentage, 3691 yards, 15 TD,  33 INTs .  Wow.  He was worth every penny.

        5.  Appetite for Destruction  - Guns N' Roses 4.  Back in Black -  AC/DC 3.  This Desert Life  - Counting Crows 2.  When I Woke  - Rusted Root  1.   Kind of Blue  - Miles Davis      Appetite  and  Back in Black  are easy. They're loud. They block out noise through sheer volume. The others are a little more subtle. They all have a way of sharpening my focus to help me shut things out.  This Desert Life  does it by sucking me in with great lyrics.   When I Woke  uses  persistant, driving rhythms.  And then there's  Kind of Blue ...   Kind of Blue  has a sort of perfect imperfection about it. For most albums the musicians do take after take, trying to perfect parts, then the producers and engineers assemble the takes into something "perfect". Miles refused to let that happen on Kind of Blue. His band (John Coletrane, Cannonball Adderly, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb) were trying something new: modal jazz. The tonality of the pieces was built from modal scales instead of chord changes. Miles had learned the concept from George Russel (who was working on his   urlLink Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization  ) and briefly tried it out on  Milestones . But  Kind of Blue  was the first full-length album to employ modal jazz, and Miles wanted to capture it raw.  The result is breathtaking. Masterful musicians pushing their boundries, trying things for the first time, sometimes failing, usually succeeding. It's likely that Miles could have recorded more takes and gotten more polished tracks on the album. It's inconcievable that they would made a better album.  All that being said, I'm not sure why it's so effective at blocking other people out.  It just is.

        5.  The Monday Night Football Theme  4.  Sympathy for the Devil  - The Rolling Stones 3.  Cannonball -  Damien Rice 2.  I Wanna Rock  - Twisted Sister 1.  The Chicken Dance      Is there a more  urlLink insidious  and  urlLink banal  song in existance than The Chicken Dance? I vote "No". The rest of the songs I can understand: I saw a commercial for Monday Night Football last night; I intentionally listened to  Cannonball  and  Sympathy for the Devil  yesterday; my roomate's cellphone ringer is  I Wanna Rock  (which is an interesting character sketch...but that's a different story).  I literally have  no  idea why  The Chicken Dance  popped into my head.  Haven't heard it in months.  Just another example of the tremendous power of music to do evil.

        5.   Mission Bells   -  urlLink Fighting Gravity  4.   Quick -    urlLink Eddie From Ohio     (yes, they're from Virginia)  3.   Slumber   -  urlLink Buzby  2.   Queen of Quiet   -  urlLink Erin McKeown  1.     Two Step  -  urlLink Dave Matthews Band     It's possible that most people have not heard of the first four artists/bands. Well, now you know they rule and you should check them out. You can't use ignorance as an excuse anymore.    If you haven't heard of Dave Matthews Band you need to stop looking at internet porn every once in a while. Even if you have a casual knowledge of the band (i.e.-what you've heard on the radio) you may not have heard  Two Step . The song's driving, captivating beat is combined with typical DMB lyrics (we're all going to die, stop worrying about it enjoy what we've got).    If you've been to a DMB concert however, you know why this song is numero uno.  The album version (on  urlLink  Crash  ) is really, really good. But in concert the song can easily become an 18 minute epic, showcasing the musicianship and talent of each of the band's members. Check the version on   urlLink Listener Supported   or   urlLink Live at Red Rocks  .  Better yet, track down a  urlLink hard-core DMB fan  and ask for better versions from non-released concerts.  On CD the song is excellent; in concert it's magical.

        5.   Me and the Devil Blues   - Robert Johnson 4.  Hells Bells  - AC/DC    3.    Friend of the Devil   - Grateful Dead 2.   Devil Went Down to Georgia   - Charlie Daniels 1.    Sympathy for the Devil   -  urlLink Rolling Stones    Robert Johnson makes the list because, as legend has it, he sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for being the best guitar player around.  This song reinforces the myth.  Why is Sympathy for the Devil #1? Because everything about it, from the  urlLink lyrics  to the arrangement, helps set the scene of the song. The intro, with the unusual percussion and unsettling grunts and yells tell the listener that this is no normal story. The percussion and simple bass line provide a constant forward motion to the rolling piano lines. Above all of this is Mick Jagger's masterful performance, painting the portrait of a Lucifer as a sophisticated and elegant figure. By the time the backing vocals chime in with their persistant "Whoo hoo"s it's easy to picture Jagger as a smart-dressed demon, dancing like James Brown, flanked by impish background singers.
