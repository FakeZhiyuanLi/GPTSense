						      Veeeeeeeerry short entry because I am absolutely shattered.... Spent the last few days in Stratford... hooray for Shakespeare... very fun... Romeo and Juliet was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!! I swear you have NOT seen a proper Shakespeare production until you see it done by the RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) absolutely wonderful.. I'm such a nerd... but heh whatever... did NOT like the flood of schoolchildren (its the week before Easter so all the schools do the funny 'educational' trips.... so the entire plays was stuffed with rude kids (NO i do NOT classify as a rude kid... I'm cultured -coughs-) lots of french students....  Have I mentioned how crazy I think British drivers are? and roadways? the whole system is wack!  Did I mention we spent 2 hrs going around in circles trying to get from Stonehenge (I went there too) to Caernarfon Castle (thats Southern England to Nothern Wales.. a 5 and a half hour trip) because the Global Positioning Navigation system in the rental cars got lost? STUPID COMPUTERS!!!!! 2 hours.... we finally gave up and started heading home.... which it told us was the wrong way.... I couldn't figure out how to turn the stupid voice off.. CARS SUCK!!! heh....  Odd observations during that crazy drive...... driving down the Motorway and passing by 6 Military Tanks on route to the practice field.............Hour and a half later.. signs which read 'TANK CROSSING' hah........ Hour later.... BIG NUCLEAR POWER PLANT..... I find it disturbing they would put the practice field so close to Nuclear power... what if a stray missile........ POOF there goes England.....  Thats enough for today... more tomorrow...

						     Yet another kinda slow day.. rainy and windy again.. bitter... almost like being at home. Went out to Liverpool for starts.. to the Museum.. which was okay until it became packed with schoolchildren (its the week before spring break for them, so they all go on their funny school trips...) loads of information on the Blitz and WWII which is what we're studying in Social Class.... I'll have all this newfound info on the Blitz and we aren't even really studying it in any detail... grrrr....  Drove off to Southport after Liverpool... you can see Blackpool from Southport.... I dunno.. kinda hard to describe Southport.. don't quite have the energy to try.... it seemed....fake to me... like a mini-Blackpool... kinda.. shady or something... lots of quaint little bookshops though... my kinda heaven... even if its seedy...  Tomorrow we're off to some Quary or something.... early in the morning (I'm going to die!! Finally just getting off the jetlag) its supposed to be something like Fort Edmonton park back home... and somewhere in there we're supposed to be visiting Uncles and Aunts of my Dads whom I have no idea who they are and have never met..... (Plus side to this... If I've never met them.. they can't tell me how much I've grown... hehe... though I'm sure there will be some variable on that.... blah.. ah well...)  Dads birthdays on Saturday.. still trying to find him something for his birthday.. not having any luck.. any ideas? Anybody? Let me know!!!!

						      Not much to add today... bit of a slow week starting, all the kids are still in school... Shannon and Christopher have gone back to Ireland (thank God) so I don't have to deal with that stress... Went shopping at Trafford Centre... got my gold shoes for grad (only Â£25! Thats about $65 cnd.) soo woohoo and all that... I think we're going 10-pin bowling tonight with Lyn and John and his girlfriend Cath. Cath makes birthday cards and the such, they're really quite neat.. hehe.. I'm trying to convince her to sell them online and let me build her a posh website.. but hey.. thats me.... Dads going to the pub (nothing new) to watch the Manchester City match on t.v... silly reallly... Andrew and I bug him because we're Manchester United fans... (come on David Beckham!!!)  We go the Stratford-upon-Avon to see the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Romeo and Juliet.. so hooray! Tuesday at 7:30.. in the Dressing Circle (-rolls eyes- first thing Dad asks the booking office "Does that mean we have to be dressed?") eesh.. welll totally pysched for that... I much prefer Romeo and Juliet over Macbeth... though The Merchant of Venice is playing at the Lowry and I wouldn't mind seeing that... (I know the story of Romeo and Juliet fairly well.. but I studied The Merchant of Venice in grd. 10... Macbeth in grd. 11 and just finished Othello this year)  Think thats 'bout it for now.... having some supper then off for some bowling... Miss ya all.. loves 'n such.. don't have toooo much fun in the cold... (i'm only teasing.. it isn't much better here.. though i can walk around without a coat.... despite the fact that the rain is very unorganized and comes in bouts without any warning and the wind is kinda fierce)

						      As the title states.. this ones going to be a lil bit lengthy.. so bear with me.. feel free to scan etc etc..... Soooo where shall I start? hmm... We shall start with the flight....  THE FLIGHT WAS FREAKING HORRIBLE!!! Done. 4 hr lay over in Calgary.. BORING... then they made us wait while they got some poor guy on a stretcher onto the airplane... heh.. only amusing part of the wait.. all the stewardesses kept lecturing "Hey! Just be glad its not you on that poor stretcher!" 8.5 hr flight to London Heathrow. I shall put in here that I HATE HEATHROW AIRPORT. There is no such thing as air conditioning in England... and the Queues (sp) wound allll through the customs room... it was hot and stuffy and there were enough Japanese tourists to make anyone sick... (I don't actually mean that to sound racist... if it does I'm sorry...)  England is rainy and windy. Don't mind the rain.. but the wind kept us at Heathrow for an aditional 2 hrs because the gusts made it unsafe to take off in a small bmi plane. None the less we made it over safe.. Hooray!... Next... the wedding...  THE WEDDING WAS FANTASTIC! At the Lancashire Cricket Club.. beautiful grounds.. hotel rooms.. lovely food.. Not to mention My Cousin Paul and Helen absolutely glowed despite the rain. Photographs were a pain in the butt... I wasn't in the wedding party but they made me take these silly photos out in the wind because we were the family from Canada and had travelled the furthest... oh well.. i was freezing but the alcohol made up for that (-didn't just say that-)  Day after the wedding... and everyones recupperating....yes... me included.. no lecturing.. Blame my father... and my Uncles... they kept putting it in front of me... Sooo now we're hanging about waiting to wish Paul and Helen off on their honeymoon... back to Canada (irony....i know) I met my new baby cousin William (8 months old) was the only baby who... didn't cry through the ceremony but laughed.. he is the happiest baby i have ever seen... quiet.. doesn't cry much... and has the most infectous laugh ever.. he smiles and laughs at everything.. certainly knows how to play up to a crowd... pictures to come very soon!  Hoping to get to see Romeo and Juliet or The Merchant of Venice at one of the Theatres when we go to London next weekend. Unfortunately the Globe Theatre is closed until May (I am ticked off... very angry.. grrrr to Shakespeare) so we have to find them somewhere else... they play at Stratford as well.... Dads Birthday is next weekend so we're all getting together for that......  A little spotchy this entry... I've loads more details on the wedding to fill through... just settle that it was lovely.. and I'm suffering a lil bit of jetlag and -coughshangovercoughs- shhhhhh again.. I'm sorry.. shutting up now and wandering off to do some homework.. wish Paul and Helen off and then go to bed.... keep in touch all!

						     Alrighty sooo heres my last entry from Canada... woohoo and stuff... totally pysched.... and its windy!! Grrr.. I hate when its windy.. windy means turbulence.. turbulence means the plane bounces all over the place... I don't think there's a sane person in the world who could possibly enjoy turbulence... Oh well...  4 Hour layover in Calgary of all places... I can't remember the last time I was in the Calgary airport.. eons ago no doubt... gross.. but oh well.. maybe I can put a dent in that homework.  I shall be sure to leave a message here when I arrive so everyone knows I'm safe... heh.. then don't expect to hear from me until after the Wedding on the 20th... possibly not even until the 23rd depending how hectic things get... Wishin I could drag everyone along with me! (in for good measure.. no one hate me)

						     In a mood to spread some news. So what news do I have? Kevin and Allie found out they're having a little baby boy... and Kev is the sweetest person in the world and told me he would seriously consider naming the little guy after Michael... or Someone Michael or something of the like so long as Allie doesn't throw a fit, which I doubt She would.. Allie is the most wonderful person on the earth... aside from Kev... they deserve each other very much.  Chris and Nancy found out that they are having twin baby girls, hooray for Nancy who is naturally going to name one of them after me... poor Chris *L* Little Kelentina and Krisarley just to keep everyone happy... Hey, at least they'll have unique names! (What I want to know is if Ethan and Joaquin sound like golfer names... are the girls names going to sound like.. what... tennis names? actress names? russian dancer names? hehe... ) Chris wants Michelle - as a female play off of Michael - which is even sweeter... I think Chris was a lot closer to Michael than anyone knows or realizes... which makes me happy to know someone was as close to him as I was..  2 days left! Woo what a countdown. Heres something entertaining... My creative writing teacher has asked me to bring back for her.... of all things... shampoo.... I nearly didn't believe her until She brought the bottle in for me to see. So for Ms. Perley-Waugh I shall bring back shampoo... rocks for my friends (seriously, they want them) and some british teen mags. Fun stuff. Who's keeping the list for me? Anyone else want anything?

						      I quite seriously feel sick. Absolutely undoubtedly ill. It sucks...very much. I think I finally managed to run myself down so much that I got sick.. -waits for all the 'I told You so's'- yeayea.. I realize i'm an idiot... headache, chills, lightheaded... and this unending feeling of exhaustion that I feel all the way through my bones..it makes it hard to make any effort move...  I think part of that is the lack of iron I've been taking -waits for the rest of the I-told-you-so's- Alright... lesson learned... Now I really must go back to suffering....and praying I'm better by Thursday.. being sick on an airplane isn't nice... I know... been there already......Adios...or something

						     Todays a much better day.. maybe because I actually got a full nights rest.. completely peaceful and uninterrupted, and I didn't necessarily sleep in... (I swear.. sleeping past 11:00am is not sleeping in so long as that does not mean sleeping more than 10 hours. I got a healthy 9 so there!)  Went out for coffee with Megs, which is always always always a good thing... unload, rewind and start fresh.. good stuff. Went shopping... heh.. shoppings the natural healer.. and hmm.. walked... hehe.. walking is also a good thing. I miss walking. I miss a lot of things. I miss rain. Boo to snow! hehe.. its supposed to rain a lot while we're in England so by the time I get home I'll be saying Boo to April Showers.  Boo to homework! I did absolutely nothing this weekend, I have so much homework to do! Gah its terrifying.. I'll weigh the plane down with the weight of it all...well that or my overall spirits... or both. Its 3 days as of tomorrow. 3 days!! Woo! I have 3 days... gah.. alright now I can panic..  I think the pets know we're leaving.. they're rebelling an awful lot lately... Maple broke out of her kennel again... as if that wasn't bad enough.. she also broke through the wood fence and into the neighbors yard. Thats twice this week. The cats, haha.. I don't know which of them is doing it but they're climbing the curtains again and dragging them down. They do it at night while we're sleeping, you spend half an hour each morning fixing it. Stupid cats. (I don't mean that, I love my kitties.)

						      You know whats scary.. me writing poetry again.. I haven't written poetry since.... well for at least a good 2-3 years now, but here it is... my jewel -rolls eyes- all this obscure talk about the River of Styx inspired me... and some great singing from High Holy Days...      River of Hate  Time here has no meaning it left on the wailing winds battered, beaten, and broken like my soul. I have travelled the worn path of misery, and pain is my well known companion. But nothing compares, to this new hell you've sent me to.  The comfort of my illusion has been stripped, stolen by your own hands. Your treachery, your betrayal, your irrepressible desire to rip me apart. This is all that I know, your lies that leave me wounded and dying.  So here I stand now, alone. Standing on the shores of the River Styx, no money for the ferryman. I'll just have to jump in. I'll drown in the River Styx, before I ever let you have my heart again.    Hooray? My poetry is always suckily dark and dreary... I should write a series about the five rivers through hell... Except that its hard to work the River of Phlegethon (River of Fire.. Styx is the River of Hate) into a poem... woohoo for challenges.... or...something

						     I don't feel like talking anymore... at all.. period... I'm sick and tired of life. For those of you who don't know what the River Styx is... its from Greek Mythology... the river which souls of the dead were ferried across into Hades... fun hey? Is exactly where I feel I am.. standing on the banks of the River Styx and debating jumping in.   New Artist Update... High Holy Days... these guys rock.. anyone remember my days as the die-hard Creed fan? Thats probably why I like them so much, their music has that hard to find.. i dunno.. sound I guess... Creed had it.. in their bass and guitar... I can't quite explain it, but take a listen or something.  High Holy Days - Website  Their alblum doesn't come out until the end of March but theres some sample music on that website.. cool stuff...  I'm going to jump into the river...    - - Treachery like I..I have never seen, so never mind your sorrows, your demons live for me. What are we doing in this place again? You know you've got the answer boy, your lying to yourself.. and I found you at the River of Styx all alone...- -

						      So we're getting busy and ready to go... 8 days left!! woohoo... and I have a P.D Day on Friday so theres a nice long weekend in there. I must admit I'm dreading it, I've already got a list forming of everything I need to get done before we leave. Top of that list - teach self Trigonometry. Which wouldn't suck nearly as much if I hadn't been cheated out of learning proper fractions/ratios and how to factor when I was in elementary. Boo to those teachers who opted out of math for art!  I'm back on a Canadiana kick... woohoo for me.. haha... Bought a new book with one of the longest title I've ever seen on a 'recreational read'.. "The Darkness That Comes Before - The Prince of Nothing Book One" by Canadian Author R. Scott Bakker. Its said to out-Tolkien Tolkien. When I first endeavoured to try and read Tolkien I couldn't understand a thing, it was hard to follow, so hah.. in that aspect i can believe it! So heres to wishing me luck in understanding this Prince of Nothing stuff. Biggest thing yet though... KYPRIOS... spread the word, this Vancity (Vancouver for those not paying attention... ) underground scene MC is fantastic (this coming from a Sarah Mclachlan fan) in an eminem meets Canada kinda way. I'm pretending I'm ignorant of his ruder MC'ing and lyrics, but his debut video "This is My Hit" rocks... my opinion, but check it out...   urlLink  Kyprios Online     "Sky is falling, the earth is erupting, don't believe everything you hear, kid, trust me. Analyze. Got a question, ask it. Don't be a market pig for a specific demographic. 14 and a girl? Your the #1 target in the world."    Maybe I'm just in a mood for strong statements... or maybe I'm just tired.. sleeps been out the window the last 4 nights for....various non-sleeping reasons... Stressing over work that needs to get done.. yeaa... sucks.. but ah well NOT COMPLAINING! (yet anyways...)

						      Math class this morning was.. uh.. interesting.. *L* We did the lesson and then She didn't assign any work in the workbook and we all just sat there wondering what the heck was going on. (All semester there hasn't been a single day she hasn't given us homework) and Matt (who sits across from me and is constantly mooching things outta me) all of a sudden asks.. of all the stupid things "Do You think you could push a cow over while it was sleeping?".....dead silence.. then everyone bursts out laughing... It became the debate of the day, somewhat like this:  "Matt I doubt your strong enough to push a cow over." "Yeah Matt, cows are vicious, they'd probably eat you first!" Matt: "You don't know that! I'm going to go push a cow over, come on guys!" Mrs. Knull: "Matthew I can't let you out of this classroom until the bell rings, then you go ahead and find your cow in the city." "Did the cow really jump over the moon?" "Do cows sleep standing up? Maybe you could push one over while its sleeping." "No, cows sleep lying down." "Matt could push over a baby cow." "Matt are you a vegetarian" Matt: "Hell no Beef all the way! I'll push a cow over, I swear I will afterschool." "And get arrested for terrorizing farm animals."  and it.. went on like that for a good half hour... crazy stuff.. crazy day....  AND.. sometime between writing my Trig 2 exam yesterday afterschool and coming to school this morning my graphing calculator went missing. Poof.. Gone. I left it in my locker.. went home.. came back... no calculator. Exams are coming up, one more thing to add to my list of panicky things.  Spanish sub again, sucked. Got no work done. Creative Writing, we... talked all period.. Got no work done. Social, was supposed to be working on prepping for the Essay on Monday... Got no work done. Today was a very productive day.    - -....Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is trying to call so help me, I can't win this war... - -    I'm having a rough night, missing Michael something fierce.... really bad... gotten to the point I'm playing old Backstreet Boys... (SEE? Thats bad..) Michael used to serenade songs from the alblums when we were like... 13 or something... I miss that...     - -....Show me the meaning of being lonely...is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why, I can't be there where you are... theres something missing in my heart...- -      I don't think it helps that I'm supposed to shadow a student at MHC on the 7th.... I feel so completely lost and alone. These are the things they were supposed to be here for... my graduation.... college.... I know its still such a childish wish.. but I want my mommy.... I've forgotten what its like to have her behind me...     - -....There' s nowhere to run.. I have no place to go.. Surrender my heart' body and soul.. How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show... You are missing in my heart.. Tell me why I can't be where You are...  Show me the meaning of being lonely.. is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why I can't be there where you are.. there's something missing in my heart.....

						     Alright sooo my day as it happened. Math class... rather okay for once, we're learning Logrithms and I actually understand it so far.. so hooray for that... exponential laws are probably the only thing I retained from grade 10.  Spanish..... darn Sperling is at a rock concert in California!!! Why couldn't he take the class with him? No no.. instead he stuck us with a mean sub and made us do an exam..... which I doubt I did so hot on... but you never know...  Then I went home for lunch (Wednesdays and Fridays sport the all lovely 2 classes - spare - lunch - spare - 1 class rhythm) and I called Joyce from GMC and asked about where my portfolio is (I e-mailed it in and my Cr.Wr teacher heard that GMC's e-mail program bombed last week..) soooooo the good news: She has my portfolio, and after explaining my situation She said She'll push it up towards the top for grading, estimating I should have an answer in a week. Bad news: This means I have to actually make a decision about MHC..... (unless they decide they hate my writing.. I will seriously die if that happens)  Making a decision on MHC just keeps getting harder and harder and harder..... but I should be going down May 7th-ish to tour the campus and check out the student residence. I get to shadow a student and all that jazz... hooray?? I was leaning to MHC before but now I don't know again...  So that was my lunchour... came back for English class which was okay, not great, not bad either.  Then I wrote my Trig 2 exam I've been waiting to do for the last month.  And I BOMBED!  Seriously... I'm expecting 12%....... definitely lower than 50.. I didn't even answer the last 2 pages....... my mind just went blank...... nada... couldn't think of anything.........oh well... I'll.... make up for it on the Logrithm test or something.

						      I feel like bitching tonight... but can't think of much to bitch about.... I'm just in a funk.. or a mood or something.... I still feel like I'm going insane or something... and tomorrow I should find out what the hecks going on with my portfolio to GMC...    - -'Cause I used to have angels that used to watch over me.. when love was not a stranger... but love ain't what it used to be.. and I don't want these devils.. they're knocking at my door.. so I.. can't love you no more.. no more.. no more..- -    Mondays suck.

						     Well since Kevin and Allie bailed on me last night during the church supper, Allie made up for it by coming out to "13 going on 30" with me today. (Off note: FANTASTIC MOVIE!!) Kevin had to work... so I'm still angry at him.. hehehe... It was nice... I got to have a 'girls day out' with someone other than my Aunt or Megs... (uh.. no offence to Megs... and my Aunt.. neh.. if you haven't heard stories of those adventures... be thankful..)  Sooo kinda-lunch (it was like 3:00) and a movie and some one on one time to talk with Allie..... I think I've come to a final decision about college..... though I still want to talk to my Cr.Wr. teacher and the counselor about it.... but yea... I'm heavily leaning towards MHC and the UofR for Journalism.... a lot lot lot more work...but the dividends are much larger as well... and I think I'll be happier....................... hooray for having a student loan until I die.  Andrew gets back from Banff tonight...... I'm going to try very hard to enjoy my last hour free of him..... and go eat something....... and stress over college more.... Good news is I have yet to get a headache today!! (ooh watch me get one just to spite me for saying that!) and... uh... still haven't done my homework....

						      Andrew is gone this weekend to a band camp type thing in Banff.... so hoorray noo little brother. That made today a... well it started out good... day... I didn't oversleep, enjoyed my day... and got ready for the church fundraiser in Mullhurst at my leisure.... great stuff...  Went off to the church fundraiser perfectly fine... Kevin and Allie were there, (they looked soooo cute together... stupid me for forgetting the damned camera!! I'll try and get pictures off my aunt). Allie's absolutely glowing, said she's due sometime around the end of September and Kevin... hah.. when he actually stayed still for once was his good old positive self. The dinner was good (always is..) aaaaaand then trouble started.....  Had to break it to my Aunt and Grandparents I'll probably be going away for college................. and uh.. for once they were.. uh.. silent...... compared to the first time i brought it up and I got a series of "Its too hard, you can't do its" so i don't know what to think... .but either way it made me start thinking about college.. which equated to my stupid headache coming back..... great... great....... and it gets even better........the night entertainment started...  Let it be known now, I'm no great lover of country music, I don't mind it, but I don't love it either... I can listen to Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Martina McBride and the like... but.....my god did this guy suck... it was -bad- country music and it was -bad- singing. And I had a headache.  I was ready to cry, seriously... Allie booked out on me with Kevin inbetween the 4th and 5th song..... I was stuck until past the 12th... grrr to them for leaving me alone!!  Haha.. but my poor Aunt was stuck there all night... hahahahaha.. (yes.. i'm evil...)  and college still has yet to be resolved....... next week.. by Thursday... hopefully........ or... neh... yea.. I'm not allowed to think about it.. it gives me headaches..    - -This one's for the girls who've ever had a broken heart, who've wished upon a shootin' star, You're beautiful the way You are.....This one's for the girls...

						      I have a god damned headache again........ and it must've been stamped on my forehead because again my Creative Writing teacher passed me in the hall and asked if I wanted any painkillers..... I told Her it was just stress aaaaand we continued on and She asked about college sooo I confessed about all the stress THAT was causing in itself........  She is a fantastic teacher.. Absolutely the best of the best.. haha......... Her husband has contacts with Grant MacEwan and She's getting Him to check on where the heck my portfolio is so I know what the heck I should be doing. (Though it does sound a lil sleazy doesn't it? -lol- I'm pulling on contacts to get me into college... like those stupid teen flicks with the rich kids having their fathers get them in to Harvard or something..... Its just a silly community college..) I've been very fortunate in school to have such great teachers....  I'm still scared that I failed the portfolio and can't get in now... Registration for GMC is on May 13th..... (lucky day, eh?)... soo I still have a headache worrying over that... and I'm hungry... I can't remember when I ate last...  I don't think I'm going to go back to school for English today. We'll see how I feel in an hour..... (ooh how many times have I said that..... Alright.. I won't kid myself.. I'm not going to English today....)  OH!!! Guess what else... MY TRIG EXAM WAS PUSHED BACK   AGAIN!!   I am seriously never going to write that exam! (Again.. why am I complaining?) Math teacher was away yesterday when we had our Conics exam.. and was away again today.... so nope.. no test... Monday I guess... (Dads getting kinda sick of me telling him in the morning that I'll need to be picked up at 4:30 afterschool and then getting a call halfway through the day saying I won't anymore.)

						     Alright.... let it hereby be known that all this post-secondary college stuff IS CRAP.............. I didn't really mean that... but... its going to honestly drive me insane.... I went a full day without a headache today.... got home.... got the mail and..........  I have my official acceptance into MHC....... officially........ "Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Medicine Hat College in the UT-Journalism &amp; Communications Program."..... Thats... fantastic... Its also expensive..... very expensive.....  And I haven't heard a peep from Grant MacEwan.....  I feel sick.. my stomachs right up in knots now. Registration for MHC started on April 16th... I have to grab my courses......  I haven't heard a thing from Grant MacEwan.....  CRAP!.....

						      I have a headache. No, correction, I have the King Kong of headaches, you know, bad enough to make you sick to your stomach or something... only we've gone beyond sick to your stomach pain and moved on to my sanity screaming    "Let me Out! Let me Out! Let me Out!"    and I've tried everything under the sun and beyond to make it go away without resorting to painkillers (because I try very hard not to become dependant on them...) and I failed... miserably... in fact I'm pretty sure I've surpassed the recommended daily dosage for these things.... but I don't care...  My Trig exam has been pushed BACK AGAIN. Thats the third time...... now why am I complaining?... hah.. i don't know.... I'll just shut up about that.. maybe she'll forget I even need to take it. Conics exam on Thursday though, aaaand a WW2 common.... and.............     - -I'm broken when I'm open, and I don't feel like I am strong enough, 'cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome, and I don't feel right when you're gone away- -     OW... okay... this headache is going to make me jump off a bridge soon...  Certainly not least (and without trying to be depressing), I'd just like to put in here a request for everyone to spend a couple minutes remembering the victims of the Holocaust which anniversary is today.... and as well for the students of Colombine... (I believe is tomorrow or Wednesday?). Thanks guys.

						      So, I went to school today.  Deja Vue hey?? Weirdness -rolls eyes- So todays lovely news is all about bullies. To all you bullies out there. GROW UP OR I'LL COME KICK YOUR ASS!  Elaboration: There are these stupid jackass boys who spend the lunch hour playing hackie-sack(sp) and crap in the hallway myself and friends eat lunch. They've officially taken to annoying the hell out of us by purposefully bunting the thing over to us then throwing a fit when we claim it as our prize for finding it -rolls eyes- Jerks. Today they've taken to picking on all the little guys who have to walk through their group to get downstairs, bully them into the lockers and the like. Ticks the heck outta me... I'll declare war soon, watch it I will. Bullies are the one thing I can't stand more than... umm.. llamas... and THAT is saying A LOT.  So BULLIES BEWARE.  I'm done ranting.. hah.. My trig exam has been pushed back again "due to weather" heh... Monday it is.. weekend of studying... hooray.... Conics test is on Thursday.... Math sucks... I shall lock the bullies in a room and force them to do my math homework.. mwahahaha..... yea... right

						     So, I went to school today.  Big step hey? Nah, I like school, I really do. That is.... until they shoved all the seniors into the gym and started the blabbering about grad... which naturally drives knives into the certain someone vs. someone scratching each others eyes out issue... -scowls- Evil school. They gave us a neat little package detailing what and what not to do during the ceremony and banquet. I found it amusing. Its done point by point, like a military drill... thats Mr. Rice for you. "No gum chewing." ... "Tassels on your left. Don't touch them." ... "Do not leave the room." (I can just see them stating loudly halfway through the commencement "Well Susie you should have thought about using the bathroom EARLIER" hah...)  It goes on like that until you reach the Banquet page, and it starts to tell you how to eat. -rolls eyes- oh boy. But ANYHOW the food sounds good, "Roasted Chicken Breast Sante-Fe with Zesty Tomato Sauce, Mousseline Potato and Seasonal Vegetables." heh... but the desert passes that by far. "Strawberry Ice Souffle with a Liquid Passion Fruit Centre and a Chunky Chocolate Flan Wedge." AND (not OR.. its an AND) "Caramel Cheesecake on a Brown Sugar Cinnamon Shortbread with Raspberry Caramel Sauce."  Sooo, anyone in the City June 3rd and 4th?? Feel free to come -coughs- its $40.00 cnd and formal attire is mandatory, but the foods good! -scowls some more- I have until May 7th to drag as many people as I think needful along with me.  And.. we get to keep our caps, (I'm not sure if this is regular practice or not, I've never heard of it).... We were thinking it over during lunch today..and could just imagine our kids later down the line finding this silly caps and asking "Mommy, whats this?" "Its the cap from my highschool grad gown/ceremony." "Really!!!.."...momentary silence... "You had UGLY school colors Mommy!" (for those who don't know, our school colors are orange and brown.. ICK)  So I'm going to go resume the moping around over grad for a bit then I guess I'm goin to a movie and the cheap theatre... yaah.... or something... hmm bleh... ah well... new day tomorrow....  Did I mention the headache monster has set upon me again? Anyone with a convienient guillotine about... gimme a ring...

						      Long weekends suck. There.. I dared to say it. Long weekends SUCK..... especially when I have no motivation whatsoever to do anything..... Heh.. and my stupid portfolio is officially a full month or more overdue..... -tosses out her future- crap i hate my life...... School at least keeps my mind occupied. Grrr.... I'm falling towards the brink of wanting Andrew to bother me just for an excuse to yell at someone. Well..... thats today.... and ugh... family tomorrow... as if I wasn't depressed as it was.......    - -I wish there was a fairytale that turned into my life, so I could kiss Prince Charming man and be his princess wife.- -    I still have to teach myself Trig... and Conics.... math sucks.. right up there with long weekends..... and just randomly.. I want to start growing some Oleander.... death in such beauty...... hah.. maybe I shouldn't have gone to see Romeo and Juliet.    - -I wish the voices in my head would leave my ears alone, so my eyes could stop their water bleeding and I could find a home.- -

						     I don't think I should have bothered coming home....coming homes supposed to be happy and I just hit the wall of despair that was sitting here waiting for me.... Why am I not allowed to be happy?   - - They've clipped my wings again, tore them apart then left me. No use to fly away, to my yesterday of freedom. My eyes died back that day seeing the hurt I may have done... Beat me instead of them pain is my only zen of fun. - -    Furthermore yet.... why do I let it happen? Why do I continually allow myself to suffer like this.... Its certainly not fair to me.. my family.. or my friends (though I'm certain half of them wouldn't give a damn)........   - - I'll go where secrets are sold, where roses unfold.. I'll sleep as time goes by.... So hurting here is where I belong, dreaming a song, blood on my hands to stay strong. The flowers in the graveyard are all gone, I don't belong, there is no right to heal the wrong. Soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die, I can't throw up don't think i even want to try. - -   I'm honestly to a point I'd volunteer myself to that damnable psychiatrist Dad always wants me to see.... even if she's stupid and doesn't care about my personal beliefs... yet.... maybe thats again where the answer lies... my beliefs have dragged me out of the gutter before......  Its spring.. I should be happy...   - - You still can't make me cry, you've pinned this butterfly down. My fires burning out, kill my flame without a frown... and starving hurts the soul when your hungry for some love... So if I close my eyes I can really fly above... and I'll go where secrets are sold.. where roses unfold.. I'll sleep as time goes by...- -   This godamned life I live is wasting me away.... My priorities are skewed... I need it back.. what it used to be... I -was- happy before I came home... I'll not lose that again... Prepare for change......   So hurting here is where I belong dreaming a song blood on my hands to stay strong the flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong there is no right to heal the wrong soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die I can't throw up don't think I even want to tryyy- tryyyy- tryyyyyy

						     Ooookay.. as promised many times over, here is the very break down of my trip and in detail. This may take a while. Pictures are coming, I promise, as soon as I find the usb thinger to hook up my camera. If not I'll get them all printed out then try and find a scanner and scan them all in. BTW: I'm lazy and instead of repeating past posts... just...read em yourselves and I'll reference ya to em..  Reference 1: Read the one from March 21st for Flight over and the Wedding. I can't much add to that about the wedding except show pictures.. which I will as soon as I get them onto the computer. Maybe I'll ask for a disc or something...  So the wedding was on the 20th.. the 21st was recupperating... We spent a day in Liverpool... I don't quite like Liverpool... we ended up at a museum (surprise surprise... its my Uncle Mikes favorite thing in the world to do.... that and our family history... Sidebit: Get new job fast so its not permanently written in his books that I worked at McDonalds).  Somewhere in there was a shopping trip the Trafford Centre, which is the massive shopping centre near Manchester. (My Aunt and Uncle whom I was staying with live in Denton, which is part of Greater Manchester) I got my gold shoes for grad, but they've been kind-of ruined by rain. (How so you ask? When loading our baggage somewhere along the line they were left out in the open rain on the tarmack. So its got this kinda stain... you dun really notice it when I put em on though sooooo I won't throw a fit.. and it may yet come out.)  Went rock climbing as well.. did I mention that? It was fantastic!!! Hah.. but when they found out we were from Canada they all started asking if we ski or snowboarded... to which we (Andrew and I) blinked blankly and shook our heads... to which they exclaimed over how could we possible have all that snow and not go out in it. --Very Easily..... ITS DAMNED COLD!!!-- heh.. I shall add in for kicks that our trainer was veeeeery nice looking hehe which unfortunately did not make me climb any better... It was a weird system... they had weird harnesses I'm not used to... they didn't give you climbing shoes, so your climbing in your runners... and they give you helmets... (In Canada we don't get a helmet but we get proper climbing shoes.. which makes it a LOT easier)  Stratford.. hmm... Romeo and Juliet FANTASTIC.. see March 30th entry for more on the driving etc. "TANK CROSSING" btw.. while in Stratford we were jumping ahead of 16+ schoolgroups (half of which were entirely French) the entire time. The Bed and Breakfast we stayed in was very nice. Very nice.... and no... not only because of the owners son.. -ducks and hides-  I also got my grad ring... heh... I don't have a ring anymore...Mom got me an opal (which is my birthstone) ring when I was 9. She always used to say that opals were unlucky... which is COMPLETELY TRUE, especially for Sherlocks. (ex. my opal stone once cracked.. we had it replaced.. once fell out of its setting.. I luckily found it outside my locker... we had it put back in.... and then 3rd times the charm.. it utterly shattered.... and My Aunt Leslie had an opal engagement ring which she lost and had to have replaced twice) - - - Back to my grad ring.. its of BlueJohn Stone... which you can only find in England... its a pretty bluey-purple with a stainless steel setting and I love it to death, not sure yet if I'm getting an engraving or anything put in it.  The Blue John mines were umm... not for the weak of heart (which they had a medical notice at the top) you climb down stairs..... into a dark cavern with low ceiling and narrow passages (Dad was walking sideways half the time) going downs okay... one guy slipped on the stairs but he was okay... we were luckily far enough from him that it did not have a dominoe effect and trip us all up. Very dark and scary... but our tour guide was very friendly and had some great stories to tell us. I'll not recant them all... despite the walk back up those damnable stairs (which takes twice as long as going down) I highly recommend anyone visiting England to stop by the BlueJohn mines.  We then went to Lincolnshire (well that kinda area... it was actually Scunthorpe.... but we're not going even think about Scunthorpe (its as bad a place as the name sounds... total industry all over the place... 6 power plants within 5 miles) My Uncle David and Aunt Leslie live there and we stayed for a weekend. Went out for dinner heh.. my cousin Becky brought baby William after work (I repeat again he is the most sweetest baby in the world... he didn't cry once and we were in a rather fancy restaurant... he has the most infectous laugh ever..) Pictures of him will come soon as well.  Flight home was a terror and a half. Flight to London - peaceful. Flight to Toronto - FROM HELL! 7 hrs of jackass boys sitting behind me who had the little cliche of friends crowding around their seats, I couldn't sleep. Flight to Edmonton - I was okay sitting at the gate... closed my eyes, decided I'd be fine so long as I could sleep this last leg of the journey..... awakened by none other then THE SAME DAMN SCHOOL GROUP!!! grrrrr... Riverside School... grrrrrr.... pox on them! or something like that....  Link thats that.... heh... I'm sure i'm leavin huge gaps.. but pictures will fill them in.. I promise.

						      I shall be kind and give warning that this will be an extremely long one.... Be patient.. and please read it guys... and then offer help.. because I feel like I'm losing my mind...  Where to start though? Everything just simply... is... theres no beginning... nor any end in sight.  Let's start with the weather, hey? Its been rainy.... foreshadow anything? You bet. The melancholy has set in and I shall repeat for the million and oneth time.......  I fucking miss Michael.  Yet, I think I only miss him because he could make me laugh like nobody else... and he could tell the whole male population to stay the hell away from me without seeming possessive.... (Alright.. yea.. he was possessive..) and... I could talk to him, about anything, and he'd listen... and he always knew exactly what I needed to hear... even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear.  Why did he have to go so soon? Why was I so stupidly stubborn and refuse him time and again?  Why the hell do I torture myself like this.  Next topic... this week. The week... THE week... has been absolutely insane... Honestly its like I'm stuck in a snowglobe or something, the only thing glued down and then some child has shaken everything up and now everything has to settle and I'm just standing... glued in the center unchanging...  Am I unchanging? Whats changing around me?  It suddenly seems that everyone i know is going through a crisis, and I'm the solid one left untouched. Or I've already payed my dues and now..... ugh.. I just don't know. Friends everywhere are falling and I'm just.. here..... fuck.. that makes no sense.  Let's try it another way... the worlds gone mad. Period.  Except that I am going through a crisis... I think.. Its most certainly the most warped depression I've ever had...ever. I just feel like I'm falling underneath everyone elses burdens and I don't know why its happening. I figured out what its called though.  It's a crisis of faith.  I came to that conclussion completely on my own and without Roberts psycho-analyzing so I'm incredibly happy with myself. That unfortunately does not help me solve said crisis.  I just... don't know what else to say... I have some scary songs stuck in my head.. like Shinedown's "45"... and i can't stop playing it. I think I'm scaring myself...     What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45, Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45

						      Today started out a crappy day......... and very slowly turned to worse and worser.  Started out in Spanish with Sperls asking "So What did Everyone do for Everyone for Mothers Day?".. wouldn't normally bug me.... except his such a freaking idiot he has to ask me as well... hah... I luckily held myself together enough to reply that "I'm the Mother in my house... and I got nada!".... which naturally created enough of an awkward situation to make him shut up.  Stupid teachers. Its in my god damned file.  Then again.... as Rob so unkindly pointed out.... its been 5 years.... I should grow up and get past it.  -whines- I don't wanna!!!!...  Life just fucking sucks sometimes. From that point on I'm just been miserable..... not wanting to talk to anyone or anything.... I'm gonna be stuck in this stupid funk for a week now... DAMMIT and I was doing so well yesterday...     I cannot leave here, I cannot stay, Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say, I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no not this time, There'll be no angels gracing the lines, Just these dark words, I find. I'd show a smile, but i'm too weak, I'd share with you could I only speak, Just how much this, hurts me.

						      So today was the big day..... (woo.. sounds like I'm getting married.. I wish..... I think it would've been a lot less stressful to just give up on being educated and run off and do that..)  I'm officially registered at Medicine Hat College.. First Semester: Logic, English, History, French and huh. .can't remember my 5th course all of a sudden.... but its there......... I have to take French.. because they're stupid and won't let me take Spanish since I've taken it in highschool. Stupid College.  I'm also supposedly screwed because I don't have a 30-level science.... Its not my fault I nearly failed Chem 20!!.. uh.... okay.. maybe.... sooo I have to make it up this summer or something..... or I can take Astronomy... if UofR will accept it as a transfer over.... I hope so -crosses fingers- astronomy is something I can handle. Chem isn't.  Either way I'm registered, and owe like.. $1900 already... and thats just tuition and healthcare for the first semester... its another $1400 for student residence.. etc etc etc..... I'm going to die.  ..........  I also went to see Mark and give him back his stuff........ Why do I put myself on these emotional rollercoasters?...... -sighs- I cried all the way back to the college and then had to make myself look normal for the tour and such again.... I seriously don't know if I could handle going to college down there......  WHY do I always chose the hard road? I don't know...... Its stupid.... I should've agreed to run off with Michael when I had the chance.... things would've certainly been different...... Its not like i lacked the chance to....  FUCK...... no regrets......  I'm seriously depressed now....... but my lifes somewhat put into perspective by other things so I'm just going to shut up..... I have nothing to complain about.     - -....Now I'm strong enough to live without you.. Strong enough to quit crying.. Long enough now I'm strong enough.. To know you gotta go....Come hell or waters high.. You'll never see me cry.. This is Our last goodbye, Its true....- -

						     Sooo Sperls is back from California.. heh.. he had a lot of funny stories to tell us... darn crazy Americans!! -is teasin!! ya know i love ya guys- maybe its just Californians (I say this confidently because I don't know any -real- Californians except Max.. and he admits to being crazy)... That made Spanish interesting this morning at least. Lots of fun, we're learning "el futuro" (Future Tense.. WHO said Spanish was hard!! Haha) and so we were making up mock new years resolutions in Spanish... mine went as follows:  1 - Yo escribirÃ© una buena novela. (I will write a good book.) 2 - Yo atormeintarÃ© mi hermano mÃ¡s. (I will torment my brother more... MY Favorite!!) 3 - Yo aprenderÃ© a hablar Italiano. (I will learn Italian.... Sperls was hurt that I was gonna betray Spanish for Italian.. haha... I betrayed French for Spanish, didn't I?)  There was more but i don't feel like digging through my character map to find all the accents.. so theres your Spanish lesson for the day. Quiero un novio tÃ¡ntriko. (-grins wickedly- my new favorite saying)  Spanish was followed by my dentist appointment.. which wasn't toooo disastrous... -very very sarcastic- I only have 12 new cavities. (Dear Lord... haha.. I know what you are all thinking.... I do brush my teeth almost every day.. but i'm bad about flossing..) Its 12 infected teeth, 6 cavities... the cavities are between teeh (that'll teach me about flossing)... they're only pinprick, vera small... but deep enough to cause a lot of pain later down the road...... so for the next month I'll be seeing my dentist regularily... we'll become friends! Woohoooo... Plus side: I got a free toothbrush!!  Ugh.. AND they took major x-rays to check on another tooth She had fixed way back when to make sure it was okay now... so I had to take my earrings out.. (boohoo right? hah..) I forgot to put them back in right after sooo naturally.... one of the holes closes up (how the hell does that work... grrr) sooo I've spent the last few hours debating driving a hole back through... (Ewwwww i know) finally I just got the ice and forced it back through.... and now it hurts like hell... Damn dentist!!!!  Filled out all my government finance forms for the registrar on Friday... soooo now its gettin an itty bit scary........still haven't heard from GMC... so crap.. haha. .oh well...  oh.. AND IT SNOWED!!! haha.. and now its sunny and everythings green again.. .but we seriously had some real snow before!!! Big flakes and all...

						     Its been a rather stressful week but oh well... I closed The Alhambra down at DtC because I can't put any effort into it anymore, so I'm enjoying chasing around the messageboard trying to up Megs on my post count haha...  I have no life.  I wrote my Social "Is war ever justifiable" essay the other day... it sucked MAJORLY!!... My key quote was from John Lennon of all people.. "If people demanded peace instead of a new television set, then there'd be peace." really bad... but oooh well..  I have a dentist appointment tomorrow inbetween classes (hooray for that, eh?) But its also supposed to snow tomorrow (weeeird stuff.. snow.. May.. uggh..) but then again.. we were supposed to have a thunder storm today.. and I'm still waiting on that...  What else........ oooh.. I haven't heard from GMC.. still yet....... grrr... but I have my appointment at MHC on Friday at 11:00 am... sooo we'll see if the going away for college is gonna be okay for me... (I'm seriously undecided now....)  I think thats about it for now.... Watch out.. hamsters are going to take over the world!!!

						      Alright.. I don't really have a pen and paper handy (says Miss Writer herself.. hah..) so this is going in here... Its secret code.. so if You don't understand it.. don't ask.. it's here more for me than for you.  Option Uno: Past -> Laiste, Moon's Daughter: Light and guidance.. a clearing of thought... though the potential for a shroud to be drawn over the eyes...  Present -> Arval Parrot: Clear communication is important here. Calmly debate the issues and explore ideas...  Future-> Himself: Protection. Protection for or he who is protecting...  Blahness..... next round..  Option Dos: Past -> Ilbe the Retriever {reversed}: Something being held back by negative attitudes... not yet the time for this seed to grow.. things need to be cleared out first.  Present -> Laiste, Moon's Daughter: Light and guidance through shadow. Clearing of thought. Potential for shroud over the eyes...  Future -> Spirit Dancer: This is a time to bring out and share qualities that we have nurtured in private... Really concentrate on a project or process.. Spontaneity balanced by self-discipline....  Ironically they share Laiste.. at different points..  I don't think that helped much..

						     Megs grad was umm different.. fun?.. maybe?.. just don't ask?  No seriously, I enjoyed myself.. it just came at a bad time.. I should have probably stayed at home and hid under the covers instead of hanging about and being miserable...  I wasn't miserable.....  just unable to focus.  I still can't focus, I've got too much running through my head to try and put it all down in words that will even briefly resemble something that makes sense.  Maybe I'll try later...

Bonus Prize: Megs grad tonight... and its her 18th.. again Happy Birthday Meggies!!... so woohoo for partying to keep my mind busy and unoccupied..  I miraculously DID survive the weekend... without Mark and I killing each other... (quite the opposite.....)... and without putting myself back down the hole of depression that so favors me..  Sooo what came of the whole experience?  I'm still trying to figure it out....  but I'm glad he was there...

						      Yes yes... I know I left off on a bad note and haven't written in a bit, but alls good now. Seriously...ish...  Still coming up on a rough weekend and I don't know what to think. I'm trying to not let myself get dragged under... Michael wouldn't have liked that... and Marks coming up so I have someone near if I need him... (Dad I think feels a lil replaced all of a sudden but meh.)  I've been in quite a good mood lately.. and todays just been fantastic. Have my conditional acceptance into GMC, which is great so long as I pass Math now. Have to unregister myself from MHC. I got my creative writing portfolio back today.. so hooray for 100%!!! (that beats out my 97% the last time i did the class) I can at least boast that much.. even if this year the class doesn't count since I took it once before.  Came home and checked on my Writing.com account. I've suddenly become liked -lol- I've got good ratings on both pieces I've got on there and an offer to help me edit it down a bit. 3 times already today I've been told my story can be published. Has the world gone nuts?!  Been listening to old tapes I went and found, hehe, which is of course oh so fun. Really old stuff like Matthew Sweet and Letters to Cleo. Ah well, all fun.  I love the summertime... its so much easier to be upbeat when your not freezing your butt off and the sun is shining. (So long as it's not too hot.. it's been nice lately)..  Wagner grad on Monday! and Megs 18th!!! Happy 18th Meggies!!!... ooh.. haha.. and its Election Day... VOTE WELL CANADA!... since I can't yet.. -scowls-    - -The rivers running low where it used to overflow.. I imagine something more.. will I live without you at all?... All my memories blend and bleed... empty arms reach out... weak with need... and I fall.. yet I'm cold and tired of change to hold on. Hold on. Hold on.- -

						      Today I think I shall share the story of Michael bear... because well.. because I can and because the Michael bear is special, obviously... and I can't remember how many people know about Michael bear.  Michael bear came into being shortly (a week or two?.. or maybe only days..) after the accident. Megs and I went out to West Ed and being the dilligent impulse buyer that I am, we passed Build a Bear and decided to do something in honor of Michael. I'm such a child, I know... Teddybears are magic guys, they make anything better.  We picked out a purple tipped bear referred to as Nikki's Bear, as proceeds from the sale of those bears went to fund children's cancer research and treatment programs. We proceeded to dress our furry friend in a tux and top hat, because Michael was our Prince Charming... and it just seemd to suit the bear right. So.. thus was born our dear Michael bear....         I swear I'll write a new poem at sometime this year.. but here as well is the poem I wrote around the same time as taking Michael bear home with me. I thought I'd lost the poem.. hah... and then Dad revealed just how much of my writing he's been saving on me.       En MÃ©moire      For a loved one lost this night, A new one now takes to flight. Cherished memories taking form, To care for our hearts...forlorn..  Precious to those who held him near Who watched and cared without a fear Flowers abundant from his hand, A smile to light the entire land.. A dashing prince to bring those smiles.. He'd do anything for us... across the miles..  Now all thats left is our cuddly bear To show him how much we truly care Brought to life this twenty-seventh Our message shall travel with it to heaven...  Our love for him will travel now To float in the stars and rest in the clouds Goodnight to a friend...oh so dear.. So far away.. but oh so near    I've got a week to start dragging all my strength together... let's hope I'm successful... otherwise things tend to go sour.  I apologize in advanced for my odd and probably cold behaviour for the coming week.

						      Tis 1:35 in the morning and I am still not planning on going to sleep anytime soon . . . nope no way no how. No point.  Soo for those who haven't heard about Creed's big breakup... alright wasn't so big... here ya have it.. POOF.. there they went. Dear Scott Stapp has been left behind to pursue writing songs for an album devoted to The Passion of the Christ (ooohhh we didn't see that coming!!!) and Scott and Mark have moved along and created.. dun dun dun..  Alter Bridge.. mwah.. its fantastic stuff guys (coming from the die hard Creed fan.. err former.. die hard fan..) They picked Brian back up! and no.. I have no idea who this Myles Kennedy.. is hehe.. but he seems to sound alright.  Listen ta the single and such.. 'Open Your Eyes'... good stuff guys... you may have to listen to it a couple of times.. but -I- fell in love with it..   urlLink  Alter Bridge     I have a lot more I could say... but you people pay way too much attention to this thing... so I won't for now...

						     I'm bored...  And when I'm bored I think...  And when I think... the whole world falls apart.  I don't have much else to say.. the nightmares won't stop... I don't get a break... I just want to cry..  I'm afraid history will repeat itself............ again. How do you fight such a thing? How do you know what mistake to fix to make it all go away?  I wish life wasn't so complicated.

						     What is this, the third entry for the day?... yea.. I talk a lot.  Andrew has been found.. so boo or hooray or whatever it should be, he woke up late and was therefore late for his exam... by a half an hour.. he's lucky they let him in to write it...  It's been super hot today and I got less then 3 hours of sleep last night and I doubt I'll get much better tonight even without nightmares it's still so hot.  I want to go for a walk... Mom and I used to go out late for walks around the neighborhood when it was hot out and we couldn't sleep... and after that Michael used to find some way to drag me out.  Those were the days..... when you wouldn't get shot for coming out of your own yard.  I'm glad we moved neighborhoods.. even if I miss the old house and the memories it held..... back then all I wanted to do was get away from what I had thought were ghosts... Thats what you get for being a stupid kid..  Michaels sister called today and we had a loooong talk... like entirely through err.. well some sort of Mandy Moore movie.. I wasn't really paying attention... I never realized how little I knew about her.. heh.. back then everything was about Michael and Me.. or Me and Michael...  Annyways... we shuffled our way through a lot of memories, both good and bad, heh half of them absolutely insane because thats how Michael was... and yea even though it put me down, waayy down in the darkest parts of my mind again, it was good.. I'm glad she called, it let me center myself again around my thoughts... I think...  It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't meant to. He was too good a guy to not have something better planned for him... and someday.. he'd damned well better find his way back to me... he promised.  The longer I think about it.. the more undecided I am over whether or not it was for the best. It tore me to pieces watching Mom go in and out, good day.. bad day... completely backwards day... It broke my heart. Michael knew that.. its why he didn't tell me at first when he became sick... I don't know if I could have stood there and watch it all unfold all over again... that was always what i said my biggest fear was.. having to watch it happen all over again...  That doesn't mean I wanted that phone call.. that I wanted him gone in a flash... Like a bullet striking me down before I even saw the gun. Which is why I can't decide whether or not it was for the best. That last christmas it was obvious Mom wasn't going to recover.. even if we refused to acknowledge it.. we all knew... She knew.  I didn't get to be there for her... but she wouldn't have wanted that anyways.. I didn't get to be there for him though.... and i'm left wondering if he would have survived the night if I was...  Bleh...  I don't want to go to sleep again.

						     I have lost my little brother....  Every sisters dream... until it actually happens.  I think I lost my Father as well.. WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY!  Have you ever had one of those nightmares where you can't quite tell if you've woken up or if your still dreaming? I think I just locked myself into one of them.... I woke up to the phone ringing around 9:05... Strathcona Highschool calling.... wanting to know where my baby brother was because he didn't show for his Social Studies final exam which started at 9:00...  I called his cell phone. No answer, left a message.  I called Dad's cell phone. No answer, left a message.  I ran around the house screaming in case he thought this was some kind of funny joke. No answer.  My stomachs in knots, I'm not normally prone to panic attacks.. but i haven't slept and... if not for the fact I fell up the stairs and hit my knee pretty hard... I'd swear I was still dreaming.  Where are they?

						      Bleh.. I suppose I should attempt to put something in here...  Wednesday was the last official day of class.... no more highschool... Katie and I wrote our little poem for our Creative Writing teacher... she's been the most influential person in my life... and yeaa.. hehe.. she cried, we cried.. Her 10I class looked at us weird and hah.. that was that...  I skipped Math class even though I shouldn't have and went down to the drama room to watch Karaoke... which was... amusing at least.. Sat in Spanish and did nothing.. then I had a spare and everyone else skipped with me so we sat in the stairwell and exchanged our grad gifts and hmm.... that was that..  Then we all skipped our afternoon classes and went home at lunch.  So there's Wednesday for you....  Thursday was supposed to be -my- day.. I fought with Dad to make Andrew go to school so I could have just one day to myself before everyone started bugging me again. So naturally what does Dad have to do? Come home from work early and start nagging at me...  Needless to say, I threw a hissyfit and he left me alone for the rest of the day...  I'm a brat.. I know.. but if I didn't get one day in now, I wouldn't get one until August... I'm dead serious.  I'm not looking forward to sleep now, which is why this is coming in at 12:30... i haven't slept well for the past 3 nights, and I'm not expecting to start sleeping well until well past the end of the month... the damn tea I make myself drink everynight isn't helping either.. grr...  Guess I'll try meditating.. hah.. I always fall asleep during my excercises...  Thats all I guess... Night!    - -Show me the meaning of being lonely, is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why, I can't be there where you are... There's something missing in my heart.- -

						      I'm having a crazy country music day... I don't know whether or not I should be scared... so don't ask me if you should as well..  Started with Martina McBride on the radio.... followed close behind by Big &amp; Rich with Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy) aaaaaaand... then it played Lonestar........ which I didn't really need right now....  Now we're on to Rascal Flatts.... and I think Faith Hill was in there somewhere... blah.....  Country depresses me for some reason.. brings back memories.. makes me think to much.... probably because I can actually make out what the lyrics are saying instead of trying to guess what some guy with long hair and makeup is screaming...  12 days left.... I don't sleep anymore.. chronic nightmares again... Its like I can't escape it... I shut my eyes and I can just see it all playing out in my head again.. even though I wasn't there and only got vague descriptions...  That was the worst phone call of my life..... It makes me appreciate that much more the lack of necessity of the hospital calling after Mom................  10 damn minutes.... 10 damn minutes away...  Ugh I'm going to quit while I'm ahead... or something     A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot

						      Today is one of those fabulously rare days where I have to make two entries. It was okay.... as per last entry... but then it just seemed to, I don't know, fall apart. I think I'm falling apart again.  I'm falling again. Slipping under the sea of emotions only this time... i don't know whos hand to grab...and the longer I hover in between reality and drowning...the more confused I become... and the more confused I become the faster I slip.  What do I want? Who do I want? Where are my priorities? Why do I again feel so upside down? What's important to me? What do I want in life? Where do I want to be 5 years from now..... who do I want to be with?  I'm breaking my own rules again. I suck at that.  I miss Michael. Desperately. So much it hurts, seriously. I'm on the verge of tears again. I had a panic attack that I couldn't remember what he looked like or who he was. It'll be a year in 9 days.... he was always so good at chasing my doubts away. One hug and my worries melted, troubles were gone and I felt safe. It didn't matter if I was angry at him or not.  That's what I want again... I want that kind've security back.... but I'm afraid to go back to the only person that was capable of making me feel that way.  Change is scary. Ugh I suck. Would SOMEONE up there give me some guidance for once!?..... no no.. I know... its one of those growing up things... I gotta learn the lesson myself.  Lessons are stupid. Ignorance is worse.  I went to see The Day After Tomorrow tonight. Good movie, shook me up.. heh.. but i'm the kind that gets shook up by environmental disaster... Love the Earth.. before She's gone.  Love your friends before they get t-boned by a drunk driver and are gone the next morning......  I should probably stop now. Goodnight.

						      - -Well somethin's gotta go wrong... 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good... - -    Should I be complainin? No.. not complaining, I refuse to complain. Happiness is precious, I should stop being paranoid waiting for the next thing to toddle by and steal it away.  Have my exam booked with GMC for Monday at 10:00 which means.. mwah.. i get to miss school..... to write an exam.... i'm not sure if thats such a good trade off. I came home after my double math period today and have decided to boycott school. I'm not going back... at least for today, so I'm skipping English.  Came home to Andrew still asleep in bed (Dad called him in sick so that he wouldn't have to face his Nazi band teacher after skipping his last band concert... WHAT about me!?) ... which sucks because I like having afternoons to myself but at the same time is good because I forgot my keys and he was there to let me in!  I don't know if I have anything else of interest to share... Mark and I are talking again which is err good?..... or just damn confusing.... I blame Rob..  Yea.. you hear that Rob.. I blame you... hehe.. as always.. ya know I love ya...  I getta see Kev and Allie again this weekend, so hooray.... if Kev can sit still long enough to hold a conversation with me and Allie isn't complainin over bein sick...  In reflection I just realized most of my friends are getting married.. or are married... having children.. or already have children oooor hah.. are having more children... I feel so left out.... (NO that does NOT mean i want to get married or have children!!! hah.. just making an observation here!!)  Nothing really deep to comment about that... sooo whatever... here's to boring old Fridays when its rainy and sucky and I getta go shopping with my Daddy -lol-... yes.... fun fun..

						     FANTASTIC day!! Woohoo!!!  Sun's out, weathers nice, summers here.. hooray!!!  and finally.. Grant MacEwan called!! Yaahh!! I passed the portfolio... sooo next comes the apptitude test... (but blah its 2 hours long) hehe... I'm just bouncing around super excited that they finally called. Released a lot of tension. Now I have to worry about passing Math!  Creative Writing Portfolio is due tomorrow. Ick. Gotta start typing that thing out. (For my final assignment I'm using the Mists story, hope no one has any arguments. I'll put it up on the web for you guys some time!)  On a serious high just from one phone call... but ooh well!  Wrote my Social essay exam today, it sucked but... I don't care! I think this may even inspire me to study Math for tomorrow! (Operative word there... -may-)  That's All!

						      Boring ole Tuesday. Really super slow. Except for lovely Mediha who is capable of entertaining anyone.... or driving them insane... whichever comes first.. She rocks.  Social exam Pt.A tomorrow, wish me luck I've forgotten what Reagonomics and Thatcherism is! (No not really... they drilled that through our skulls rather painfully) Hooray for more essays! -sarcasm as usual-  I found out today that Steven got married over the weekend instead of going to grad. -THAT- is crazy.... whats crazier is He didn't freaking tell me.... (My fault.. I think I shoulda clued in when I saw him in Ben Moss with his girlfriend, maybe?)... so there.. I'm not even graduated and 2 of my friends are (getting) married. Backwardsness.  I have that new Cherie song "I'm Ready" stuck in my head, I suppose its a good enough summer song! Addicting at least, I'll eventually get sick of it!     I'm moving out there, So baby beware, because now its just a matter of time Before my fast cross, and the sky falls, The very monent that i tell you, you're mine.  I'm Ready, Come and find me, I'm not gonna hide, I got the sun on my side, It's heavy, 'cause I'm finally Open for the woman, I'm Ready, Ready. I'm Ready for Love.     aand Katie just called so I'm going t'help her with her 10 page assignement for Cr.Wr... which reminds me that I should be working on mine. Blah. Work.

						      So here it is the fabulous new design. None other than coca-cola.. (Take that you evil Pepsi lovers!!)Not so dark..... its also crap, I don't really like it too much.... I can do better.  Nothing much else to really add, Maple's gone on to Her new home and Andrew threw hissy fits. Seriously... the last time I saw him that upset was 6 years ago at Mom's funeral.... blah.. didn't need to bring that up.    - -Your love is like a summer rain, washing all my doubts away. Seven days and seven nights of thunder, the waters rising and I'm slipping under, I think I fell in love with the 8th World Wonder.- -     That's all I have to add, normal day of school tomorrow. Free of exams as far as I know. Crap, I didn't write my play scene for Creative Writing. Ugh. Oh well, I'll fake my way through it.  Have I mentioned lately just how messed up the male race is? They confuse the hell outta me.

						      Let's take a moment here to commentate on how STUPID the Alberta Education System is. Diploma exams SUCK. Down with exams!!!!  Can it be assumed I did poorly on this one?  Hell no, hah, I never do bad on essays. Doesn't mean it wasn't impossibly hard. I memorized quotes from the wrong damn story, the theme we had to write about was Determination. Determination sucks, I am now determined to shoot it down. Hardest essay I've ever had to write.  Oh well, I wrote about rock climbing, how fun is that. Hehe. At least for the Creative part, my critical essay was a bit, umm sad... and only 4 pages long when it should have been 6 or 7 at least.  We're giving Maple away today, so I'm sad over that, but She'll prolly be happier. Not that She ever looks unhappy, I swear You could scream bloody murder at that dog and she'd still love you to death.  My brothers room stinks, avoid it at all costs. (I have no idea why thats in here... maybe because he left the door open.)     Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place.     Ohhh, and I've decided to redo the design for this blogger, something brighter, summery maybe? Not so dark. I don't feel so dark no more.

						      Soo here it is as promised - the much anticipated GRAD PHOTOS!!!! Now, I didn't take many (40 maybe) and they're all just the same group of people in different poses sooo I'm only gonna post a couple and maybe give a hint as to who I am in them all if you don't already know! (-coughs- gold dress)            I promise I'll have a -lot- more after the Wagner grad... lot lot lot more, but there ya have it, my fond memories of my own McNally Class of 2004 Grad.  What else did I promise? Ooh.. hah.. pictures from England... unfortunately I've lost most of them, in fact, any of the Wedding ones will have to be scanned in now, but I do have a picture of my new cousin William (8 months old)... hehe.. yes.. its beer he's trying to drink (my cousin John is the one giving it to him).

						     BAM  It officially hit me. I'm graduating. I'm growing up, I'm not a kid anymore. (a lot of my friends argue I never was...)  So if that isn't dramatic enough for you.... it gets better -major sarcasm- I look around myself and, I like where I am, I like who I've become, I like where I'm going, I like the freedom......  I don't like the fact that my Mom isn't here to see me. I don't like the fact that Michael won't arrive on my doorstep with roses to whisk me away to the Banquet like we always planned. I miss them. I've been in tears all afternoon...  I'm going to go do my makeup and put on my dress and start crying all over again..... as Dad said after I 'recieved' my diploma.... "My God, We Survived.".... 6 years ago I didn't think I would.... Hell.. 1 year ago it seemed impossible.  And here is where I'd like to put my formal thank you. My thanks to everyone, all my friends who have supported me through my problems, those of You I've known forever, and those of You more recent, all Your love and support has made this possible, and while it sounds absolutely ridiculous considering we've never met - most of all to Kris and Kelsey. Thank You to everyone.  Okay... back to crying...

						     Commencement was yesterday. You know I should be thrilled to bits, but I really am not. It was boring as hell. The guys kept pulling out their cell phones as their friends at home txt messaged them the score for the Calgary-Tampa game. Go Flames?? Hah... no.. I don't like Calgary.  So I'm officially a quarter graduated. I say a quarter because the ceremonies are completely fake, I could bomb all my exams and really, then I wouldn't be graduated, I'd be stupid and have to stay back a year. So this week is the first half of graduation... the rest of the month of exams is the second half. Exciting, hey?  Have tickets to the new Harry Potter movie for today after the Banquet meal. What kinda geeks are we? Haha.. Oh well, it should be fun, we won't get out until like 1:30 am. woohoo!!!  I'm stalling having to get ready, which is bad, I'll be rushing around in a couple hours like a chicken with its head cut off. Oh well.  And No. I'm not going to mention anything about the issue with the ex because its not worth my time and just seeded with lies and crap. Time to move on already. Which is what I'm doing and I'm happy.  I PROMISE to try and have TONS of pictures as SOON AS POSSIBLE.... but it may be like... 3 years before I get to it! Or Sunday.. when I can take it in and get a CD done... -someone- has gone and lost the cable to hook the digital to the computer so we're just kinda stranded. This is the reason no one has seen my pictures from England yet either.  Working on it.  Until tomorrow!

						      It's a super fantastic chicken surprise.  I did not just say that. Heh, I've got it stuck in my head, stupid Dwayne putting things in my head. Insanity.  Pausing in between school and dentist again, and I'm again starting to stress out horribly over everything. Where shall we start? The beginning is good, but, then You would be here for infinity and a day.  Tomorrow I walk across the stage and recieve my Diploma saying I'm somewhat educated. Hooray? I think... Its nerve racking to say the least. I have 2 exams tomorrow, one in Math and another in Spanish. Wrote a Verb exam in Spanish today (I completely blanked out on Future Tense!!) and tomorrow is on Vocabulary. Math is on Statistics, so hoping that since I'm doing so good understanding the homework I'll do okay on the test.  I still have to do a test run of my grad outfit for Friday. Stress.. stress stress!!!! Not to mention I need to memorize quotes for my English Pt.A Diploma, and study for my Social Pt.A Diploma, both of which are next week, and then my Creative Writing Portfolio is due on Friday, AH! I don't have my 10 pages done yet.  - - - -   ~We were strangers, starting out on a journey. Never dreaming what we'd have to go through. Now here we are and I'm suddenly standing, at the beginning with You. No one told me I was going to find You, unexpected what You did to my heart, when I lost hope, You were there to remind me, this is the start.~   - - - -  Had to pause in between there to go to the Dentist... woohoo for never having to see her again....... for another 6 months. So now I'm numb and in a pissy mood because of it. Oh well.  20 minutes before I write the second half of my English test. Blah. Boringness. Come home to some more stress, but eh.. well..  Did I mention I'm sick of being emotionally blackmailed? Yes well, I am, and those of you who do it to me, stop before it spins around and bites you back harder. You know it will.

						     Hah... I have no idea why I'm putting this here... I guess i just am really proud of it.. for some weird reason. It's a poem I wrote off of a Smirnoff Vodka ad I pulled from a magazine, see if You can guess which one. Soo here's "The Jesters Court" by moi.. Karen..     The Jester's Court  Do not become carried away in the stumbling moves of this game, the diagonal shots and parading horses, a passion that can move the unmoving.  The Bishop is leaning far to the side watching with redrimmed unholy eyes, the events that occurr between the unclean, unpromised, unaware, and undone.  The taking of the pawns was illegal but no one will complain right now, the severe alteration of state will catch up, but not until the next morning.  The King has gone and turned his back now, the Charming Prince has swept in for the steal, Lady Guinevere has fallen. Checkmate. Pure drink.

						      Alright -belle enfants-... sit down for this one.  I had a mental breakdown today. It was really bad. What qualifies as really bad? Well.. let me describe to you... there was a lot of yelling and screaming over absolutely STUPID things that made no sense at all and did not connect.. there was a lot of tears and slamming and stomping and cursing out every god ever known to human kind. .. and it ended with a sharp knife to my wrist..  I made my little brother cry.. without even meaning to.... I seriously upset my Dad... he didn't get angry.. just got.. one of those looks... y'know.. like a wounded animal or something...  Needless to say... all th'medicine in the house got locked back up, along with a good majority of the sharp objects.  I have to go back to that stupid Doctor. They're going to put me back on anti-depressants... Which only makes me feel worse.  I want my Mom more than ever now.  What happened to feeling safe?  Someone.. please.. I'll give you every cent to my name.. just put a damn bullet in my head. Now.      Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,oh  She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.

						      Boys are stupid. I hate them. Childish enough for ya?  I at this time am forced to resign my position as teenager. I can't do it. Its a rollercoaster thats making me sick. I quit. No two weeks notice - I'm walking away. Crawl under the bed and never get out.      I miss you, miss you so bad I don't forget you, oh it's so sad I hope you can hear me I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same      I want mommy. I want Michael back. I want the whole world to just stop and go away. Just GO AWAY! Everyone...  If I believed in hell.... I'd rather be there than here.      I didn't get around to kiss you Goodbye on the hand I wish that I could see you again I know that I can't      If anyone needs me I'll be hiding under the bed waiting for darkness to overtake...  It's worse at night.. but at night no one can see the tears.  I quit.     I had my wake up Won't you wake up I keep asking why And I can't take it It wasn't fake It happened, you passed by  Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go Somewhere I can't bring you back Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go, Somewhere your not coming back

						     Introducing the brand spanking new and improved Blogger of Mine!!! (-patiently awaits all the loud cheering to end-) I decided I needed a new change, away from the summer of Coca-Cola and into an Autumn of studious uh.. browns... Yes I was lazy this round and did not make the design myself but instead used a Blogger template. Yah me!!           It's a super fantastic chicken surprise (hush I didn't say that!! And damn I need a new strange line instead of stealing others.. I'm taking suggestions!! lol)          The new features of Blogger of Mine V3.0 (or is it 4?) includes the Make a Comment choice, which means all my adoring readers may make a comment on my posts, cool, no? (-awaits the harrassment to begin-)           No no, don't stop now!! Blogger of Mine V3.0 (or is it 4?) also includes the new -Link of the Day- function!! This will include a link, chosen by me as the "LINK OF THE DAY", something of great interest which I think all my friends and readers should check out.           Today's link of the day is.. dun dun dun.. Alter Bridge!!! New band with their cd just newly released (on the 10th i believe) I swear, check it out, these guys rock! (Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips from CREED as well as former member Brian Marshall from like, way back and new lead singer Myles Kennedy) CHECK IT OUT! Yes, its an order!          Enjoy!! (btw, the picture is of Dad and I on our little day trip out to the mountains when Aaron came to visit. Columbia Ice Fields, Jasper National Park, Alberta.)           ....and unfortunately I just realized that the 'LINK OF THE DAY' is hidden in the Title. Click the title to check out Alter Bridge!!!

						      - I was so naive to let you have control of me.. but now that I believe in me.. I know.. Your wrong and i'm strong.. unafraid i'm moving on.. 'cause i'm free to be me.. nobody tells me who to be..-           I am absolutely sick of guys and their temperments.... driving me nuts. I quit.      I'm sick of guys flirting with me... stop already!!           I'm beyond screwed up... I want school to start... -badly- people who don't know me.. don't have judgements on me... won't try and force me into one thing and then another...           Won't make me feel guilty for wanting one thing instead of another..           Aaron called today.. so he got home safe which is good... though his sick.. which sucks lol... couldn't handle the canadian weather, eh? -ducks and hides-          I also go to talk to Kevin and Allie.. which as always was hilarious.... Allie is absolutely fed up with being pregnant... and so takes it out on Kevin as its supposedly his fault lol..... and Kevin is his normally million and one things at once self... hehe Allie's coming with me to get clothes for school so woohoo...            I'm still registered at Medicine Hat... stupid school....

						      I used to have angels.. that used to watch over me.. and love was not a stranger.. but love ain't what it used to be.. and I don't want these devils.. they're knocking at my door..           Where'd my angel go? Where's that little guardian that sits about spending his day making sure I don't cross the street and get hit by a car... get attacked by psycho killers in the middle of the night... protects me from the demons in my mind.... from heartache.. hearbreak and the devils of love...          Michael used to have his moments... We used to sit outside in his backyard at night... and mind you I was probably only 11 or 12 at the time.. right after Mom died.. It was a play off his name for me... though I'm sure his Mother chose the name very carefully (she's rather religious).. I used to tell him he was my Guardian Angel.. he made me feel safe and protected from all harm... and of course... Michael being Michael he would laugh and tease.. "I'm not only your Guardian Angel princess, I am -the- angel. You don't get any better than me darling." ... Very Michael-ish no?          I have no idea why I remember that...          The only thing Michael couldn't protect me from was Michael...          Sweet irony... oh how I loathe you.. (I'm in a melodramatic mood... ignore me)           I do not believe there is one thing in this universe that is more complicated than love.. alright.. save Math.. if I can fail at Math.. I can certainly fail at love... There are so many types of love... sibling love.. family love.. friendly love.. passionate love.. love for ones neighbor.. ones country... and hell.. for all we know in a decade for ones planet or universe.. love for ones God...          You can love a friend as if they are your brother or sister.. or you can love a friend as they may also be your lvoer... your Father or Mother could be your best friend... your neighbor could be the confiding force you need to keep going through the years... Pride and love for your country gives you a sense of belonging... but so does your family.. your friends.. your community.           Furthermore the universal symbol for love is the heart... Now... considering I failed the part in bio where we discussed the human heart... I suppose it probably is fitting.. its just as damned confusing... illogical.. logic belongs to the brain.          So why do the brain and the heart compete so much over matters of love?          I've stopped making sense.. I'm going to go hide..          Yes.. I certainly am a writer at heart... err.. in mind... it runs in my veins! There!
