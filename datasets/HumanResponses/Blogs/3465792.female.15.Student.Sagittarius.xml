						   I biked to my library today and on the way passed my mom who then decided to tell me she had just picked up my book. Well, at least I can still go to the bank, I thought. It was about then that I realized that I had left my money, a home. Great day so far.so. got woken up early, (12;50pm), couldn't pick up my book, bikes a piece of shi*, got cramps going on, and I forgot my money. The good news is that I now only have $8 dollars on my card and I found a giant cat fish in a stream near the library good for a Monday though way, yester-night at the very stroke of midnight, my radio turned itself on! I was highly surprised as I was reading. I also felt a warmth in my chest. Two minutes later, my folder fell! I think it was mainly me, but I think my old friend, The Presence, came back these "dreams" happened when I was half awake me explain... At the end of December last, as I was waking up around midnight (I have really odd sleeping habits).. In my dream------.					I was sleeping  on a mat that had four chairs surrounding it. I was at a sleepover and my friends were sleeping on the chairs. I dozed of then re-awoke in the corner of the room( which was very large and had nothing in it) and it was my be. There was something over me and it was naked to my eye(invisible).It was very malevolent and I could feel it as an aura. I was under the blanket and my head was to the side. IT began to blow/whisper in my ear. I tried to cover it with the edge of my pillow but couldn't. I tried screaming and thrashing but I had no control over anything. I then got control of my arms and tried to hit it but there was nothing there to hit! I being myself was never afraid of it but I hate being controlled finally left and I awoke. my second dream goes like this-----					 I was in my room sitting on my mattress talking to Aaron on my new phone when I felt it enter nearly rushed in and I felt it coming and knew what IT was. I was going to tell Aaron about it when it got control over my voice. I struggling fiercely for a few seconds when it left my room. I was wondering why it had left me without doing anything to me when it rushed at me again. It did this process 3 times I awoke and got angry with it then marveled at how it was doing this and for what purpose. the third one occurred as such on Monday, January 5 or 12------ I was in my bed in the same position as in the waking world, body straight and fingers clenched. Suddenly, the PRESENCE was at my side. Not malevolent in any way,but there. I tried to talk but again, I couldn't. IT began laughing and then IT spoke! IT's word went something like this "You don't have..." and the rest was lost as I awoke.  	those are my PRESENCE 'dreams'. I know that they aren't just dreams but something of a another sort. I have nothing to influence them in any way. No movies, conversations, pictures, nothing. It might just be a poltergeist *tucking* me out from my slumber. Whatever IT is, its as if its testing me... kinda. In the first, it enchants me by whispering in my ear. Then it tests me of my strength, then it even talks to but of what I hope to learn. Then it checks upon me periodically. What does this mean? Why me?Oh well, why try...?

      ggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!@ i just learned that eathen leaves tuesday! i should throw a perty then for monday, a birthday party! yesterday i had to get up at 7 am- i was so irked at my mother  cause we didnt have to leave till 7;20! i lost 15 minutes of sleep. we had to pick up charlie then go to the optomotrists.  even though we were late, we still had time to get icky mc donalds. when we got there, 3 old people came and went before us. agan, i ws irked. they shot air in my eye! the rest of the day was absolute crap!. o well.i went to liz's birthday party today and it was fun. she has a pool (hence birthday pool-party) and nobody went in for a long time. liz, neda, aaron, erica, jesse, halley, alez, max, micheal, sara, me, other friend,sam and other people(most likely) came. there was a turtle in the pool and it would fallow some people around...like halley.she was on a thing and tried to move the turtle away and she lifted her leg up and it ended up between her legs. it scared the shi* out of her!it was fun and i think liz had a good time too which is good. i didnt know aaron had a celebrated birthday party... this coming from the girl who talks to him every day. at the end of the party i ended up forgiving aaron, i just cant stay mad at him. damn!neopets is still down. i think i might be a weather witch person thingie..../ i can kinda control the rain. whenever im starting to get annoyed or depressed- the sky gets all cloudy then eventually if im angry, itl rain harder with every pissed thought. when i was at my aunts being held back by the rin, i was talking to my cousions about being stuck there by it rainging hard and it began to rain harder for about 5 secionds. i said it again, and again it rains harder. cool!

Finding th door with the key is leading me farther away from my dreams.  the path i've taken has lead me from the way with contradictions to my dreams  theres so many doors here, i can't find the one. I feel the waves, washing,  washng me away.  the things I'm finding i never knew i had. i know now that i've learned. i've locked away ....so many things. mistakes are made, and so i learn.   the key i've found  has unlocked so many doors. the waves i know, the friends i've made. so many things rushing a head.  through thick and thin ive learned to cope. death will come and ill tag  along. this is what the door has opened.  this is what the Key has done.    thets it. i love it so much. (just to tell you it is capywrited and if you use it, you have to notify me!) i went to the dentist this morning and we talked about toads. my dentist(she lives near me) told me that she has toads in her backyard and she wont mow her lawn while they're in front of the mower.

      meh... nobody loves me, or thinks of me as a good friend... when i got back from my aunts house and was puttimg together the gazebo(yes im still working on it)i was talking to my mom and she said i didnt love her. then when i came inside and she was dooing laundry, she asked me if $20 was a good allowance for a week. YESYESYESYES!!!! of course it is but then i remembered our little money crisis, aparently we didnt have enough cash in her savings account and our hopkins house was sold for less then our new one, and mom wanted to pay in cash... were a bit chort on money... Is she trying to buy thisLOVE she speaks of from me? if its that, then what      the       fuck! she also said that Bill was going to move out(again, he already has had an appartment for about the past 8 months, but doesnt live there because apparentl;y(again) somebody wants to kill him.so he thinks its safe endangering his mother and cuddley baby sister!), that were going to rent it out. there goes my second bedroom....yeah.. elliot found two mice in the shed today after the gasoline canister got knocked over. he then tried to kill them. there was a hole in the floor that they went through so he took the gas canister and POURED and sloshed it over the hole!this coming from a christian AND an 17 year old boy with his mother right outside the doors! he then blocked of the ground route to get out, and i took a really pointy, sharp, sgardening tool and jabbed it countinously into the hole. but whenever i pulled it out, there wasnt any blood...0_o

      well, im less pissed now then this morning. i went and saw 'around the world in 80 days'. it was good. i liked the evil chinese warlord ladies finger attachments. they were cool. then i got pissed off at the MC again because she took way too long  with her friend and so i left the store. at slumberland i found a bunkbed thats bottom was a futon. only $349.99. we'd have to buy the mattress thiing to it seperatley but im ok wit that. didnt get to remake my quilt though. i found a pretty, petite, black cat in the forest behind my grandpas house. i fallowed it into the forest and continually treid to coax it out but it kept going deeper in. i was waring my cat ears and i think it was confused. that and i kept meow-ing back at it convincinly. hhhh,mmmmmm, is she a cat or a human? i think she (the cat)(yes, it was obviously a she) was being called by something and kept going deeper in. i faintly heard something too  but im not sure what.

      never wake me up early in the morning (about9 o'clock or so)! the only words you'll get out of me will be "i'm not going" and"get out!". then i'll just go back to sleep. that is till this morning when my mother told me my brother GOT SHOT! yeah, he got shot! it was shrapnel- ish as far as i know....he got hit in the arm and something to do with his hip. i know its bad of me to say this, but he didn't get hurt enough to be sent home only enough to stay in a hospitl for a few days.><! damned bush! why cant somebody be smart nough to sign a peace treaty that says we'll leave eachother alone?that no wars should brake out between eachother, and that we should cooperate nicely, fairly, and negotiate our problems? why doesnt anybody do that!?!?!? then everybody can be happy and we can get back to just flicking eachother off.well about the last post... i got over that thing slightly when i woke up the next day. dont try to put me on the pill, i'm already taking too many. lets see here, 4 vitamins, i ...thing(i don't know what its for), and 1 for adhd. now you know why im always so hyper.

      Two men from Texas were sitting at a bar, when a young lady nearby began choking on a hamburger. As she gasped and gagged, one Texan turned to the other and said, "Y'know, that little gal over yonder is havin' a bad time. I'm a gonna go over there and help her."  He sauntered over to the young lady, held both sides of her head in his big Texan hands, and asked, "Kin ya swaller?" Gasping, she shook her head no. He asked, "Kin ya breathe?" Still gasping, she again shook her head no.  With that, he yanked up her skirt, pulled down her panties, and licked her on the butt. The young lady was so shocked that she coughed up the piece of hamburger and began to breathe on her own.  The Texan sat back down with his friend and said, "Ya know, it's sure amazin' how that hind-lick manoeuvre always works."  remember your cyber sex aaron? ive just read one and its completely skrewed over. theres nno sex, nothing  really happens.the girls real horny and the  guys a dweeb. hes wearing glasses and takes them off goes to the bathroom in her HAMPER unknowingly, then goes limp, tries to find glasses, finds them and knocks over lit candle. burnes down house without ever having sex! its funny but im not going to post it. the website has tons of funny storys on it  click the title to lgo to site. im gonna continue to read it. see aaron, i dont have you call you everyday now to see what your doing!

      The Monkey  18-I-1999 A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink and while he's drinking it the monkey jumps all around all over the place.  The monkey grabs some olives off the bar and eats them, then grabs some sliced limes and eats them, then jumps up on the pool table, grabs the cue ball, sticks it in his mouth and swallows it whole.  The bartender screams at the guy, "Did you see what your monkey just did?" The guy says, "No, what?" "He just ate the cue ball off my pool table, whole!", says the bartender.  "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron.  "He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll pay for the cue ball and stuff."  He finishes his drink, pays his bill, and leaves.  Two weeks later he's in the bar again, and he has his monkey with him. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a maraschino cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his butt, pulls it out, and eats it.  The bartender is disgusted. "Did you see what your monkey did now?" he asks.  "He stuck a maraschino cherry up his butt, then pulled it out and ate it!" says the barkeep.  "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron.  "He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that damn cue ball he measures everything first!"

      i also gound this!i found it quate interseting! The Jewish Genie 21/XII/1998 Better late than never... An Arab has spent many days crossing the desert without finding a source of water. It gets so bad that his camel dies of thirst. He's crawling through the sands, certain that he has breathed his last, when all of a sudden he sees a shiny object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him. He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the sand, and discovers that he has a Manischevitz wine bottle. It appears that there may be a drop or two left in the bottle, so he unscrews the top and out pops a genie.  But this is no ordinary genie. This genie appears to be a Chasidic rabbi, complete with black alpaca coat, black hat, side curls, etc. "Well, kid," says the genie. "You know how it works. You have three wishes."  "I'm not going to trust you," says the Arab. "I'm not going to trust a Jewish genie!"  "What do you have to lose? It looks like you're a goner anyway!"  The Arab thinks about this for a minute, and decides that the genie is right. "OK, I wish I were in a lush oasis with plentiful food and drink."  ***POOF***  The Arab finds himself in the most beautiful oasis he has ever seen. And he is surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.  "OK, kid, what's your second wish."  "My second wish is that I were rich beyond my wildest dreams."  ***POOF***  The Arab finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems.  "OK, kid, you have just one more wish. Better make it a good one!"  After thinking for a few minutes, the Arab says: "I wish I were white and surrounded by beautiful women."  ***POOF***  The Arab is turned into a tampon.  The moral of the story is: If you do business with a Jewish genie, there's going to be a string attached.

      Charlie called Sunday night at 1 am. Turns out DQ is a slave driving business, working its minor employees to work until 2 am. Charlie s girlfriend, Jesse (same grade as us and school) is a bitch. She broke up with him and his heart must have been crushed. He has such a fragile heart…. he had even bought her an expensive promise ring. 3 diamonds in the middle with rubies outlaying it. During track one day, we had to run for 25 minutes, so she runs home with a few friends while i'm yelling for her to stop and wait 100 yards behind them. They would only look back and laugh harder every time I called out. I gave up and went home depressed. Then Monday night, Charlie calls my mom and she puts him on speakerphone. Found out he was NOT working until 2 am but smoking weed with co-workers. On a lighter note, I’ve come up with a few ideas for remaking my room. The first one would be taking down my mirror doors from my closet and putting up two of these really cool Asian curtains (shower) made of silk. Then, instead of my bead being on the ground, i’m getting a bunk bed. Hopefully the one with the lower half being a futon. I’d sell my current dresser for something more slim. I’m keeping my desk. We’d get rid of my fan, I no longer use such things as those. Painting my room black and red. Red above the divider, black below.im going to have to stay somewhere this weekend from Friday till Sunday evening. The only available place would be my aunt Deb’s but I don’t want to stay there, too far from civilization and a non-aol using computer. The only good thing would probably be that shed get me anything.hmmm, is that an unauthorized piercing I hear. The only other thing could be my cousin Lindsey staying over. fun… yeah… kinda…..not. SOMEBODY SAVE ME!!!!!!! I’m great with sleepovers! Camping is fun! I’ll even play dollies but someone has to save me!

      i went to alex's party today. it was a lot of fun. i guess i got really good at playing ddr wit the controller over about 2 years. funny, i havnt even played it since 2 years ago. it was tons of fun beating people. then before i left, i was able to watched the mv of the blonde song. i had to leaave at 4pm tho. then i went around doing things till 5;30. then i hit the road. we first detoured through red wing then went to rochester. we checked into a 'country inn hotel' and didnt bother to check how deep the pool was. IT WAS 4 FRICKEN FT DEEP! ended up not really swimming in itbut got some water crap in my eyes instead. they had nice beds too.ion the way there, a song called'there coming to take me away(again)' was lpayed ont he radio. it was hilarious. i''m gonna try downloading it.

"babysat" my second cousins kids. all i did was go down stairs and watch  tv and "the hunchback of notre dom" for 3 hours. i got there at 9pm and stayed till midnight. i got the curtains for my closet but i still need to take my mirrors down cause there a newsance. went to a wedding yesterday(some ladies daughter) and tried champagne. it was ....interesting. i began to hiccup and my mom thought it was from the champaigne. it wasnt. id been hiccuping all week and all day. we also went shopping and bought a prom dress for $15 'mint condition' from JC Penny's. also bauhgt myself a nice sun dress for another $15 and a really cool 'tatters and rags' prom dress for $100 . its really cool. i plan to wear it to the white house on thursday when i get my tour  there. they've actually  stopped  giving tours of it but we got in on a special favor from the president. how cool is that. even if bush is a nazi reincarnation. its also on my grandad's birthday that we tour the whitehouse. were going to be gone from tuesday morning at 8;30, maybe earlier. till friday. the i go to camp on saturday or monday. its monday. im going to be at camp when eathen gets back and i probably wont get to see the village with you guys either. i miss ani.we celebrated my grandads b-day today at my old church. i was there from 1;30 till 5pm. it was boring untill one of my brothers, the one that nearly had his finger chopped of a weeek and a half ago, wentaround the place in a wheel chair. ranting like the old and decrepid. it was funny. i served punch, then cake , then i picked up everybodies dishes. then i served cake again. then i served punch and finally left the party with my uncle.

       t    his is my 50th post!!! yay!!!! i had a bloody nose last night at 12:36.i was doing something to my nose, dunno what, and i accidently nicked it. it bled for about a minute or 2. wasn't half bad either. i bougth a shirt that says "cancel my subscription, i'm over your issues.". i really want to wear the new dress that i bought to the white house but i guess i have to wear the sundress. damn!right now my cousins makins me a fake id card for the airport people. my aunt kinda screwed up when she booked us tickets. she got ticked off at the people and they asked if i had the same last name and she just said yes. too bad. it takes $200 to get a new ticket if i cant get on the plane withthe one i have. the card looks ok. feh. iom bored and i dont want to pack. also hungry. when i came to my aunts house my neice/cousin person was asleep on the couch. when i next saw her she was standing with her chest on the couch, holding her ear. she was still asleep too.

       im back from washinton d.c! it was kinda fun but i didnt get to go any where and also found out(in my heart) that my mother doesnt really love me and im just a dependant upon her till im 18. then she'll buy an RV and move arouind america and maybe to other countries. also found out that she bought a digital camera-im keeping it no matter wat!- just for this trip. what i found out about the camera also is that you can only take about 28 pictures (maybe keep 16 which is watr the cartridge says). i left at 8:30 am tuesday and arrived at 11 something. had to change my watchs' time an hour ahead. we took a shuttle bus to our hotel (the Hyatt regency). it had a gps that spoke. it was cool. this guy got i and his phone kept ringing, the tune from comedy centrals' show about pranks on people, and he always spoke in italian. we were alll very silent because of hs presense. when we were about 5 miles away from our hotel, the guys phone rings and he's like 'hello, oh hi. yeah, yeah. im in washinton now. yeah, i took a shuttle.....'. itb was really funny because we brought my cousin who just happens to be   gullible   and her reactions were hilarious. we once poked her lightly in dc, and she yelled out ouch! our hotel was right across from the fire station. we got this great idea to put tracy on its gurney and send the picture to her mother back here. her mother was really concerned about her safetly too. she called long distance to just m,ake sure how tracy was.we were going to attach a message that said ' well, shes safe' or something along the ines of that  . i'll post later about the rest
