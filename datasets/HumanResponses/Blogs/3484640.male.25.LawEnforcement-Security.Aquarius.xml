      It's early in the morning as i write this. The sky is dark, the creatures are humming and i look out from my cluttered desk onto the empty sidewalk below.   That's all irrelevent really, but i am just setting the scene as i hear good writers should always do. Not that i am a writer, let alone a good one, but i just feel like sharing.  Having a place like this is a lot of responsibility really, it is easy to write fiction as fact and lead people astray, so i must put careful thought into each and every post.  Hmmm...no pressure.   Down to business. The title is tribute to the fact that i have recently discovered my strange love for new socks.  I had thought it perfectly normal to buy a few new pairs everytime i ran out and couldn't make time to do the laundry, but this dirty habit (well, excessively clean habit in fact) has recently been exposed by my fiancee who disparaged the expanse of my sock collection.  What am i to do now?  The fact of the matter is, when you've had a long, hard day mostly on your feet there's nothing quite like coming home to a brand new pair of warm socks. To me they bring a unique sense of comfort for just one day that others may find in alcohol, drugs, meaningless sex or a nice home-cooked meal, and then...done. No more newness! They're still socks, they still do the job, but the comfort they bring after their first washing is just an echo of their previous splendor that gradually diminishes over time.  I know this is a weird thing to be talking about, but sometimes its nice to find some comfort and joy in the simple, little things in life.   Rest assured, this entire blog won't be about my sock-related eccentricities, i just thought i ought to explain my title.

      I just had a thought that maybe we are supposed to fill in these blogs daily. Since we've missed a while I have decided to update the details of the past week I've had. It has been a fairly bad week for me; a close friend of mine was in a car accident. My partner and I responded to the 911 call and got there shortly before the paramedics and he was fine (or stable at least), then in hospital he was still fine, so we left and got on with work only to discover that soon after we left he had died due to his head injury. That night I got rather feisty on a forum (deserved, but somewhat out of character for me) and took out my anger, and since then I have been suffering from what my fiancee (a nurse) describes as a greif related cold.  So there you go, eventful but horrible.  Plus Ronald Reagan died too of course, which will greatly affect my workload as he's here for the next few days. I realize that sounds rather unsympathetic of me, I do respect all former presidents whether I agree with their views and policies simply for the fact that they were once president, but right now I am just thinking about the heightened potential danger in my city. But anyway, good and bad are evident in every situation and there has been good news this week too: My cat, Bandicoot, is soon to be a mom!
