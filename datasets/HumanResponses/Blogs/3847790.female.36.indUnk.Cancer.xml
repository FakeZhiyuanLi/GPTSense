						   Okay 8 hours of sleep after 40 hours without does not even come close to making things better.&nbsp; I woke up today wanting to kill someone.&nbsp; That subsided with a large&nbsp;infusion of coffee and a chocolate hedgehog, all before 7:30 this morning.&nbsp; Chocolate makes my world alright. &nbsp; Kes was in a tizzy last night when I got back from visiting the "Little Prince" (or as I like to call him, "the infant formerly known as Dane").&nbsp; I'm not sure what happens when I am in the house, but I think Doug slips her caffeine or sugar.&nbsp; I took her to bed with me rather than try to fight her to sleep and put her in her crib.&nbsp; She flopped around, sat up, laid down, smashed my face with her head, kicked me, tried to crawl out.&nbsp; I was rapidly slipping into unconsiousness and wound up just hanging onto her ankle for dear life, hoping that I would either stop her from falling out of bed, or that there would be enough velocity to pull me along with her if she did, thereby waking me up.&nbsp; But blessedly, she crashed (to sleep).&nbsp; I seem to recall a middle of the night episode where she kicked Doug in the head, but since I was not the one feeling the pain, I went back to sleep! &nbsp; I can't wait until there is  another  baby in the bed with us!&nbsp; Maybe we should just pad the entire room with foam rubber and mattresses. &nbsp; At any rate, all I can think about now is more sleep and maybe making an offering to the Goddess of Toddler Sleep that Kes will sleep in this weekend! &nbsp; Good night!

						   So I have had exactly one hour of sleep since 6:00am yesterday morning.&nbsp; Why? you ask.&nbsp; Because my beautiful twin sister Cathy gave birth to a healthy baby boy this morning at 5:58am.&nbsp; His name is Dane Ryder Shewchuk, he weighs in at 8lbs. 10oz. and is 22" long.&nbsp; The birth went so well and I am completely euphoric and on a total high (well, okay - a large Seattle's Best creme brulee latte has helped.&nbsp; And a Coke.)&nbsp; My sister rocks.&nbsp; She is a goddess.&nbsp; I am in awe.

						   In explanation of my obscure reference above, I am referring to the pincers on a crab, as opposed to the stinger of a scorpion. The story goes thus:   Yesterday I was off work on a sick day and decided to take Kestrel to daycare even though I was home. After a brief moment of intense guilt, I dropped her off and she was happy to go as I think it's like perpetual Disneyland there, where they sing and play all day and let her do whatever she wants.   I picked her up at the end of the day and she and I were hanging out waiting for Doug to get home. It was just the two of us as Hannah is camping with my parents right now (love them). I was sitting there watching t.v., minding my own business and Kes was hanging around my legs, when suddenly I felt her hand on the bare skin of my leg, just below where my shorts end. I thought to myself "she's not gonna....." and before I completed the thought, she had pinched a very tiny piece of my skin between her fingers in what felt like the grip of a fully grown pro wrestler. As I was screaming "OW!" at the top of my lungs, several thoughts flew through my head "pinch her back? punt her across the room? drop-kick her?" Intense pain has a way of bringing out the violence in me. Luckily for all concerned, the loud scream on my part startled her enough and after she gave me a look of disdain, she cried. We comforted each other and when I revealed to her the mark she left behind (I bruise like a peach), she gave me several loud and sloppy kisses somewhere in the vicinty of the wound.   Not only that, we can now add biting to the list of defenses she has. We purchased a Little Tykes climbing apparatus with a slide from a friend and she loves it. When I tried to take her off of it, however, she bit me. Same scenario, me thinking "she's not gonna....." and then boom it happens! Perhaps this should be my alarm bell from now on? DON'T GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT!"

						   So for those of you who have witnessed "nursemaid's elbow", you all understand the horror of seeing your little one in extreme pain.  For the second time, we have had Kestrel up at the hospital to have it "reduced" as they call it.  For those of you who don't know what it is:  it's a subluxation of the radial head and got it's name from nannies who used to "snap" their charges along behnd them, and in doing so pulled their elbows out.  The most common ways it occurs today is by picking up child by the forearms or wrists, swinging them by the arms or doing the "helicopter" (one arm, one leg), the child hanging off of something and letting go with one arm, or by an adult grabbing the arm to rescue the child from falling, etc.  It instantly causes extreme pain and loss of the use of the arm.  An older child may say the pain is in either their shoulder or their wrist and it tends to radiate either way.  Once the elbow is put back in, the pain is instantly gone and the child resumes use of the arm as though nothing ever happened.  It is extremely common and I don't think it is often connected to abuse by professionals unless you are coming in all the time with it.  The first time it happened it was simple, go to the hospital, wait three or four hours, get it fixed.  They fix it by rotating the lower arm to palm up position and then folding the arm all the way up until they feel it click.  It hurts like hell at the time, but like I say, it stops immediately.  We aren't sure how it happened, Hannah and I were in the kitchen and I think she probably hung off the baby gate.  The second time it occured at daycare and since there is somewhat of a language barrier (they are from India), we were not able to determine exactly happened.  I might point out that they absolutely worship Kes and would tell us if they knew.  I believe she was most likely hanging again as she is a complete primate.  I decided this time that I didn't want to go all the way to Children's Hospital and demanded that we go to the clinic instead.  After a two hour wait there, the doctor told us he didn't want to touch her and we should go back to the hospital.  Doug was so pissed, as was I because every doctor in the world knows how to fix this.  We ran home to give her some food as she had not had dinner yet and I took her to Children's myself.  Two hours later two doctors tried to fix it and it did not seem to work.  Neither of them felt it click and Kes was absolutely apoplectic by this time.  But as she began to use the arm a little, they let us leave and said to come back if she was still not using it in the morning.  All night she tried to turn onto her right side, would get part way, cry and roll back.  It was heart-breaking.  At one point I helped her get over because she likes to sleep on her right.  The next morning I left Doug a note to call me at work when he got up.  She was still not using it and was complaining ("OW!"), so he came and got me and we went back up.  This time they x-rayed it to make sure there wan't a fracture or something.  But they determined that it was still the elbow and this time time the doctor got it back in.  Right away she started using the arm and all was well.  Poor Doug just can't handle these episodes, so I have to try and be the strong one.  I can't imagine what he will be like the first time there is blood or worse, a broken bone.  It won't be pretty!  One thing I note is that losing one arm did not slow her down much.  While all the little sick Chinese kids sat placidly in the Emergency waiting room, Kes ripped around trying to escape via the automatic sliding doors, screaming at the kids who were playing with the toys she wanted and finding the one electrical socket in the room.  I did not sit down for the entire two hours and was exhausted.  I just know that this will be my "grey-hair" kid.....

						   n.   1     Chem. & Minerology   crystallization in two or more fundamentally different forms.    2     Biol.   the exhibiting of different forms at different stages of the life cycle.    3   the condition of a tumour containing a mixture of several cell types and different types of neoplastic tissue.  With the exception of the third definition, I have to say that I have been feeling very much like the above.  I know there are women out there who can balance family and work and every other activity they engage in.  Not me.  I feel like I am always having to pleomorph (see definition two) in order to just stay on top of things.  Hence why I often fantasize about being somewhere in the south of France with a glass of the region's finest in one hand and a great novel in the other, while the au pere looks after the children.  But of course this is Oprah Winfrey's life, or Julia Roberts' or Cameron Diaz' (if they had children). Okay, I know Julia is going to have two at once, but who WON'T she hire to help out?  All I know is that I ache for my little "Pootie" and my big "Mookie" when I am not with them and one day it won't have to be so.  Even if I do suffer daily abuse from the former and would spend most of my time telling the latter to "turn down that godawful noise"!  Well, maybe I won't channel some fishwife, but you get the drift.  I need, no crave, those rare hugs that Kestrel deigns to bestow on me when she feels it might gain her some leverage in the bedtime negotiations.  And I want them all the time.  Is that really so much to ask?

						   Oy.  Now Doug thinks she is allergic to chicken.  Oy.

						   So inexplicably, Kestrel begins to break out in hives over her entire body for the last three days.  What do you do when that happens?  Well, when you are my husband, you blame any and all foods (all of which she has been eating for six months or more with no reaction), you blame her bedding (which she has been sleeping on for the exact same amount of time) and then you begin reaching at straws: grass?  cleansers?  detergents?  We manage to narrow it down to the nasty rug in our living room that she lays on and rubs her soother on.  We remove the rug and Doug goes on a mad clean-up of the house; stirring up more dust than in The Mummy, in turn triggering MY allergies to go beserk.  Then he declares that we clean all pillows, which by the time I am ready for bed are not anywhere near dry.  No restful night for me.  I can only hope that the rug was the culprit because I cannot stand much more of his paranoia.  Add to that the fact that he can't get Benadryl and Benylin straight (one being an antihistamine and the other being a cough formula) and I may very well go mad.  The only saving fact in all of this is that Kestrel seems mainly unaffected by her bout with hives and manages to torment us in between by being an angel intermittently as per normal.  And I want another child?  Yes.  While I know that it will be hell and I will be stressed out and tired, I know there will also be those great moments that are irreplacable.  And the fact of the matter is that they DO grow up eventually as displayed by my almost 13-year-old.  She's all legs and boobs, which brings on a whole new set of worries, but let's not go there.  I have one excellent card to play when things get tough.  And that is that Nanny (my mom) is but a phone call away!  Couple that with the fact that I intend to keep my daycare in my employ for at least two days a week once off again and I should be able to fumble through!

						   Heaven and Hell.  Ah yes, well there you have it, don't you?  A day in the life of my 19 month old.  These days are very top heavy with "NO!" and "DON'T!" and "STOP IT!"  Combine that with the fact that she can now defend herself with slapping, kicking, head-butting, pinching and grabbing and you've pretty much filled a day!  But in spite of her apparent flaws (faulty genes no doubt contributed by her father), I love every square inch of her!  I did not imagine for one moment that I would end up with a strawberry blond, blue-eyed child.  Especially since my other daughter is brunette and brown-eyed like me!  I cannot stop looking at her without wanting to kiss her, much to her disgust.  There have been times where I wanted to literally absorb her; put her back into me so I could have her with me at all times.  And how can I not almost cry when I ask her a question and she responds "Okay", except that it comes out like "Okee", not unlike the way my Australian (second) Dad would say it!  Or when she stands at the fridge and says "cheeeeeese".  Or when she suddenly comes out with a complete sentence: "it's very hot".  Sigh.  To love them and not love them at the same time - the eternal parental conflict!  And I don't want to use the word hate because it just simply is not true, but I have been known to use the term "little bugger" in relation to her!  Of course, it's at that very moment that she throws her arms around me and plants a big "mwah" on my face!

						   It has been some time since I did an entry and here's why:  We made a ten day trip to Montreal and I was involved in the preparation for departure, the actual trip and then the return with a three hour time difference.  The five hour flight each way went well, but here's where I get to shatter your image of me as a mother.  The thought of having a willful, screaming toddler inside of a large metal box on wings 30,000 feet in the air was a bit more than I could bear, so (head hangs in shame) I drugged her.  I gave her Gravol.  Now, we had timed our flights for early morning and late evening to increase chances of her sleeping, but felt that extra insurance was needed.  Those of you who have toddlers know that they WILL adjust their cycles purely for the benefit of tormenting you.  She has never shown any inclination towards motion sickness and she has travelled by air before (she wasn't quite mobile then), but I figured why leave it to the fates?  The one thing that we noticed right away was how compliant Gravol made her once she had woken up.  Don't think that it hasn't occurred to me to put this great substance to other use since then, but I have refrained (ha ha, of course I would never!  All I have to do is think of my mother telling me about all the kids that were stoned on Phenergan "back in the day").  Montreal was very hot and humid, but enjoyable.  We had visits with Doug's parents and our friends, who while we were there, got the great news that there is a baby waiting for them in China!  It was really wonderful to be a part of that.  I got some great fabric for my baby blanket business that I am starting and can't wait to get sewing!  (P.S.  if anyone wants info on that, you can email me)  We got to see the Jean Cocteau exhibit at the Fine Arts Museum, or rather La Musee des Beaux Arts and it was really good.  Except for the nasty security lady telling me to not touch the glass that was OVER the artwork (and the purpose of the glass is.....?)  I mean if I was touching a PAINTING, then you can say something, but jeez, pass me the Windex and I'll remove my fingerprint IMMEDIATELY!  Anyway, we also got to the Contemporary Art Museum and that was good.  I get saturated by art fairly quickly, and wouldn't really make a good student of art, but I DO enjoy it.  Did that make any sense?  So that was that.  Now that I have returned and reviewed my blog, I realize that it could come across as fairly negative and I try to do it in a humourous light, but let's face it - raising kids is damn hard work and there is a lot of stress, especially if you a) like your sleep; b) like your stuff; c) like your space.  But one thing I have to point out is that the good far outweighs the bad, hands down.  My kid could wake up at 4:00 am, puke on me, poop on me, hit me and so on, but all she has to do is her Steve Erkel imitation and all of that stuff is erased!  Top that with an unsolicited hug or kiss and I am a puddle on the floor!  I thought I would take this opportunity to list some of Kestrel's milestones to date.  She is approximately 25 pounds, 30-32 inches tall, has just moved into the 18-24 month size at Gymboree and Old Navy (my markers for her growth!) and wears a size five shoe (finally - midget feet!)  Thanks to her dad's genes, she is exactly average on the growth charts, which pleases me to no end.  Hannah was so much bigger and since I am a whole lot older this time around, I am happy to have a smallish child.  To compare, Hannah was 9lbs. 3oz. and Kes was 7lbs. 4 oz. at birth.  Hannah looked three months old when she was born and when Kes arrived, all I could say was "she's so tiny!"  But I am getting sidetracked!  Kes' language surprises me every day.  She comes out with words that I don't recall teaching her which leads me to believe that she is just soaking it all up!  When she first started saying words (around 9 months), she started with (in my opinion) two-word sentences, although I am sure professionals would dispute that with me.  Within a very short time span, she could say:  Hi Dad, all gone, all done, bye-bye, uh-oh.  Now her vocabulary has increased and even though she mostly speaks only one word at a time, she'll surprise me occasionally with things like "Oh, it's pretty" and "This is yummy" and "Where's Hannah?"  I notice as she learns new words, she'll forget about others as though her brain is saying "yeah, yeah, I already know that one - leave me alone!" and she has her own special words for a few things, which I would like to list:  Annie = Auntie Dougie = Daddy (she alternates between them, as Hannah calls him the same name) Pubby = puppy (she does say this one right from time to time) Ubby and Uppy = Up (self-explanatory) Th-th-theeeeeeee = Soothie (her pacifier)(aside:  French word for it:  "susse" (say "soose") Oh shbee! = Oh it's pretty (she says it the right way now, so this is an oldie - took forever to figure that one out, btw) and my personal favorite: Bob-Bob = Spongebob  I am sure there are many more, which I will try to add as I go.  She is just so darned cute and funny right now!  Anywho - will end this one for now.  Ta!
