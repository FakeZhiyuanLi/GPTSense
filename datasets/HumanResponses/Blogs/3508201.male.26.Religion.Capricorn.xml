      You'd think I would have something really cool to say for my first blog.  But I don't.  I don't have any real words of wisdom or anything spectacular to post.  I just wanted to put some text on my page.  Makes you wonder why I set up this whole thing to begin with, huh?

      Society used to call me a "latch-key kid".  That basically meant that mom and dad weren't home when I got home from school.  So the key was left under the mat or under the secret location (probably behind the garage thermometer).  I would go inside, put my books down, and grab a Little Debbie snack cake as I unwound from my hard day at school.    Next I would turn on the babysitter, i.e. the television.  I would chill on the couch as I watched GI Joe, Transformers, The Dukes of Hazard, or Heathcliff.  Ah, those were the days...  But my generation was the first one to grow up in front of the television from birth to graduation.  Cable television became mainstream during this time.  Sesame Street taught many kids their ABC's.  And I learned teamwork and creativity by watching the A-team.  And although I did spend my share of time on a BMX bike with friends and on a miniature baseball diamond playing Little League, my friends and I grew up nursed by the digital nectar of  technology.    This has caused its fair share of problems for us all.  Its caused us to replace some of our relationships with gadgetry.  Our need for the high-tech has caused us to regress into a virtual world of digital relationships.  We have IMs, PDAs, DVDs, and MP3s.  What about TLC?  And although we probably all need to Trade Spaces, I'm not talking about the cable network.  These all let us share information at an instant pace.  We can contact anyone anywhere.  But we never have to speak to people face to face, shake hands, or even give a hug.    This has created what I call  digital emptiness .   This is the fascad that we really have real relationships via email and cell phones rather than real life.  We are duped into thinking that a well-written email is just as good as an eye to eye conversation.  We watch reality television so we don't have to experience a reality of our own.  Shoot, we don't even have to play real sports anymore.  We can just join a fantasy league and let the pros do it for us, all while collecting valuable intra-office bragging rights.     Even in church we have grown bored by the non-usage of technology in worship services and private devotionals.  Now we have DriveTime devotionals for those of us too busy to actually read our own Bibles before we go to work.  We have PowerPoint to satisfy the ADD adults our televisions have created.  We use videos to illustrate Biblical truths rather than in person.    Don't get me wrong.  I'm highly in favor of using technology creatively, even in  churches.  One of my favorite hobbies is trying to learn how to edit videos and create Photoshop images for precisely that purpose.  I believe it is highly effective when used correctly.  But I do not believe that it will ever replace the relational void created by our digial society.  Technology will never give even our Christian relationships the density or transcendence God intented in real community.    Instead we have "cotton candy" lives.  Things seem sweet and colorful and fun from far away.  We give the aroma of having taste and the perception of having depth.  But our lives are just as shallow and tasteless as a mouthful of colored sugar on a stick.  Our pursuit of virtual relationships has produced an ever-growing counterfeit of the real thing.    Does anyone understand what I'm saying?
