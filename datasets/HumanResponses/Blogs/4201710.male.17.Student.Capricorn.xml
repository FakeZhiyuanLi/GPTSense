       having a slight headache while writing this entry.. woke up at 9 plus today, quite early considering its a saturday morning. followed dad to his company doctor at habourfront. WOW! the view from the doctor's was wonderful.. i could see the sky meeting the ocean.. never knew tt there was such a nice view in singapore! compared to my room where the view of the sea is coverd by the trees. sigh.. how nice if i could stay in a house with such a nice view in the future.. haha. i am dreaming! then went for my dental appointment. dunno why i felt hesistant to step in the clinic, but lucky it din't hurt tt much. i hurts now and while i eat though.. oh, then i went to play soccer with thomas n kenneth at a field near my house. played for the mad cows! we won 2-1! but poor jiawei wasn't so lucky in athens. anyway she tried her best, very proud of her. u rock girl so keep on rocking!!! Go for bronze yeah! now very very tired.. may have to go to grandmas for a while later. that's all for my saturday. boring i guess, but eventful. glad tt scv showing soccer this weekend again, hope i don't have to be kept in suspense every week before kickoff. come on u guys at espn, take it easy on scv. we need our soccer! dad wants me to study now.. so i got to go..   "You will never forget your first love. That's what makes it so special. You love so hard, so deeply, and so intensely because you donâ€™t know any different. It's the best until it is over. Then you hurt like you've never been hurt before. Eventually you love again, but you love differently. You will love more carefully, more cautiously. Just know that there is so much more love waiting for you, but there will always only be one first."
