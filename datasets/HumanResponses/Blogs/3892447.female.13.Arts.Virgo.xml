      so today was ok i guess. first on the way to jazz camp we had to pick up Seth Grill and bring him to jazz camp. He's cool. Also I had a rude awakening when BLAKE was there! EEP! hahaha jk it wasnt that bad. So yeah i guess i did better today. My favorite part is the solos because you get to express your jazzy side and show people how much you love your music. Even the drummers got a solo and it was awsome! but anybody who calls me an amateur bassist BETTER SHUT THE HELL UP! even though its true, i learn fast and i think i did good today compared to yesterday. During the break i went to Dunkin Donuts and actually got a DONUT! and of course a lemonade coolata also! so after i went over amandas house and we moved her whole room around. There were a lot of random moments just from today! then we took a break and went downstairs and watched tv. Then we heard her parents in the other room and theyre like "lowells is burning right now" and were like HUH? so yeah. I saw it on the news. It was scary especially cuz ive been there before several times! and now this random restaurant we go by to douglas is dead! The saddest part was when I saw the list of ice cream flavors BURNING! wait...i like burning things! but it was still sad. So then amanda and i continued with our quest to move her room. WE got hurt a lot! (did i mention i did the whole thing bare foot?) my foot crashed into her music stand 2wice, amanda stepped on my toe, i tripped on something that i forgot, amanda hurt her arm and got a bruise, she got hit in the face by accident, and other stuff. But it was worth it cuz amanda couldnt stop thanking me so i felt special. I think i should move my room too. Well now im watching cheaper by the dozen with my family and its sorta funny i guess. Yeah and my mom and everyone is laughing like cows and omg its really bugging me! ugh i g2g!

      well i didnt get to update yesterday, so heres what happened yesterday.  Yesterday was really boring and i really really wanted to go over amandas house to help move her bed but my mom said no cuz i had to go to 2 birthday parties. One was my aunts 50th birthday and the other was my uncles 26th birthday. The first party was at Doc's Sports Bar. Its a really cool place cuz theres like tvs everywhere and its just plain cool! but i didnt have too much fun there cuz there was nobody there. There was this dude there and he was staring at me. I didnt stare back. I dont tihnk he was flirting because who the hell would want to stare at me! so yeah. there was also these wicked spicy buffalo chicken thigys and those were really hot! i ate them anyway but i got heart burn later which wasnt that bad actually. the secon party was at my grandmas house and it was just a small get-together but i watched tv most of the time cuz i was bored. when i got home i WANTED to update my blog but my mom said NO! shes been in a wicked bad mood lately!  well heres today... so today i went to jazz camp for the first time and it was cool! there were pplz i knew there like gemma and lauren so YAY! but.... when we were playing the songs i sucked soo much! i cant even read bass clef music! well i can just not fast enough! so yeah luckily i wasnt the only bassist there. Dan Ehramjian was there and hes wicked good. After an hour i went to dunkin donuts and yay gemmas so nice she bought me a lemonade coolata and a corn muffin! thanx gemma! so yeah and we got kiddie coolatas and they are soo small! but still cool! so yeah then when we came back we were doing this blues/jazz thing and we did solos in it and my solo was ok i guess. I like solos theyre cool! so yeah then i went home and my mom had to go to the post office and i sat in the van waiting...then this random old lady comes in the van and im like "ok?" so shes like "oops im in the wrong car" and im like "yeah" so then she goes into the car in front of us and drives away. yay! so now im home and thats my day so far!
