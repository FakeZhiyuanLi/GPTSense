      Being an extremely loyal fan to Saturday Night Live it almost hurts me to write this post, however I becoming more and more agitated with the direction the show has been going in.  Honestly, it's just not the same anymore.  So I address this post to Lorne Michaels himself, and I digress...   Lorne, Oh Lord of Sketch Comedy,   What in the hellllllll have you been thinking?  As the main man behind the scenes of SNL, isn't it your job to keep the SNL name alive and well?  Well I'm sorry to break it to you Oh Canadian One, but your job might soon be mentioned nightly in the breath of fellow famous Canadian Alex Trebek.  In one word...Jeopardy.  Lorne 'ol buddy 'ol pal, I have to tell you, the level of "funny" on SNL just isn't the same anymore.  The talent has gotten progressively worse over the years, the sketches are watered down, and the visuals and original ideas are just sorely lacking.  Let's take a quick look at the recent cast members, and then we'll venture into the old school and see if we can make some sense out of this.    Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, Chris Katan, Will Ferrell, Finesse Mitchell, Maya Rudolph, Seth Meyers, Darrell Hammond and a few others.  Now let's reminisce about some of the old cast members... Chevy Chase, Dan Akroyd, Chris Rock, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Phil Hartman, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Jim Belushi, Dennis Miller, Dana Carvey the list goes on and on.  Now if my calculations are correct, some of these people have more funny in them then most of the recent cast list put together.  Except for Will Ferrell, and Darrell Hammond, I don't just see anyone up there who has that "it".  Farley, Murphy, Rock, and Hartman had "it", Katan, "Finesse", Seth Meyers, and Jimmy Fallon.. ennnhh not so much.   So to you Lorne, the man who also brought us those fantastic Canadians "The Kids in the Hall", I ask:  How do you plan to fix this mess known as the last couple of years?  You can't expect to just bring back the occasional superstar to host, and expect that your true fans will just call it even, as if the last few years just somehow vanished into thin air.  It's honestly to the point, and I'm sure true fans will agree, that you should either go on the biggest talent search ever conducted (I'm talking Americal Idol 10 times over), OR - and I know it will hurt for you to hear this - it's time to hang up the pens and pads and call it a Night.    ~J~

      For whatever reason, tonite turned into Michael Jackson "Do you remember the tiiiiimmmmmeeee?" nite.  Very nostalgic, and I'm not really sure where it came from, which I suppose is one of the best times to be nostalgic.  Thinking about the years past, the friends I haven't seen in a few years, the ridiculous shiest we used to do, and could get away with, just because it was us.  "The Mummy", the "Stone Cold Nights", South Park soundtrack nights.  The Rock t-shirt, 5th Floor "Don't be one, eat 'em" T-shirts, Drinking Volume's 1-x, The fridge in the outer room.  Beer Land, 100-cup, random road trips.  Trips to "W" Big M just to get Chicken Finger subs.  Rolling 10 deep in the The Drunk Bus for after the bar trips to Nick Tahoe's just to get Garbage Plates at 3 or 4 in the morning, and then having to drive an hour and a half home.  People jacking the pizza delivery guy after the hockey game, and then splitting up and running to God knows where around campus to not get caught.    As I sit here and ponder all of this and so much more, one word comes to mind.  Invincibility.  We were so popular, and so well liked, we walked around knowing everyone, or at least knowing that everyone knew us.  Basically no matter what we did, no one cared because it was "us".  For those who haven't experienced this feeling, I must admit it's invigorating.  But that leads me back to "us".  What happened to "us"?  "Us", like every great group of friends is bound to be tested at some point.  We're so scattered all over the place, some not even in the country.  Some of my closest have gone off to fight for us, and thankfully they've all returned safely.  If you haven't had a loved one or close friend experience this (in my case both because they're all loved ones) it's a tough concept to grasp.  How do you keep "us" together?  Phone calls, IM's, Road Trips, and weddings seem to popular techniques in our group.  Hey we're getting older, I mean one of "us" is pregnant for God sakes (many congratulations btw!!)!!    So this brings me back to invincibility.  Collectively we were invincible, but does that still hold true as individuals?  Does something like that carry on with you once everyone is scattered?  Do other people notice it?  Do the others feel the same?  I know it's hard to believe that anyone could truly be invincible, however the bond we share makes me think differently.  It's a rare achievement in life, to find a group of friends that you would do anything for, and know they would do anything for you.   Maybe it's exactly that, which makes us invincible.  Love all you guys.   ~J~

      Well I've decided to bite the bullet, and start blogging.  I started a quasi-blog on my old website awhile back, but I just never kept up with it.  I know what you're thinking... So what's going to change this time?  Answer: I don't know!  But hopefully I'll be inspired by enough of on-going things around me to fire off thoughts, and inquiries.  For any that truly knows me, I'm inquisitive by nature, sometimes to a fault.  I question everything and anything, mainly because of the fact that there are no absolute truths.  Will my brain be the end-all be-all to answering all of life's questions?  Probably not, so if that's what you're looking for, you came to the wrong place amigo.  But hopefully my words will cause you to at least *think* about things from a different perspective.  Maybe not from *my* perspective per se, but will at least allow you to venture away from the cookie-cutter ways of thinking that so many people succumb to, if only for a moment.   With all of that said, I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and if you indeed DO, and I don't update it enough, feel free to light a fire.   ~J~

      So it's Sunday evening and I'm performing my usual channel surfing magic and I land on Steve Harvey's Big Time on the WB. Just as I turn Steve is introducing a harmonica player who's played w/ Ringo Starr, and has a full-time gig at some casino in Vegas so of course like him I'm assuming he's an older, paid his dues musician. To both mine and Steve's surprise turns out it's a 10 year old kid. Steve jokes with him as he does with all of his contestants and then lets him play. Now having heard some pretty good jazz and blues harmonica players in my (albeit still early) day, but this freakin' kid was amazing. And I don't think it was just because he was 10, he was legit and I was impressed. So he finishes and the crowd goes nuts, and he proceeds to teach Steve how to play a few notes which of course the crowd eats up. Then Steve makes a joke like "hold on let me show you how to really play"..camera cut stage left, and out walks none other than Stevie Wonder.     They found out that Stevie Wonder is one of the kids idols, so Steve called in a favor to surprise the kid. The jammed together singing and playing the harmonica and it was just fantastic and I found myself thinking.. You know there aren't many music "artists" today who would do that. I use the term "artists" loosely because frankly most of the musicians today are so corporate cookie-cutter and watered down they're more like show entertainers than artists really, and the meaning is completely different.     Back in the day music was about the love of the music, feeling behind the music, music that made YOU feel, and appreciating the people who religiously followed you. Now it's pretty much about two things, but one major thing...marketing, and money. The actual talent isn't what it used to be plain and simple. And the connection with the fans certain isn't there like it was either. Stevie Wonder is getting up there in age, so props to Stevie for making a kids dream come true, and showing everyone else what a real artist, and a real human being should be.
