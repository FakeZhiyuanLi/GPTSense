						   Nina Alyssa turned  four  years old this month. She is beautiful, smart, funny, and a light in our lives. We had a special celebration at my house Tuesday night and her Gramma (Nina), Papa (Art), Uncle Artie, Anthony and I had pizza from Papa Murphy's, lots of presents, and a cake she picked out special from Bel Air bakery.  Nina "scored" this year with lots of great presents. Her brother got her a soft, floppy teddy bear who she named "Clowny-bear". She says it has the best "ears" to soft. She got two puppets--one bunny and a kitty. Thanks to Mom and Dad and Artie for buying things that MAKE NOISE.  She also got a kareoke machine from her Uncle Artie. Nina is quite the singer these days. Since I've been playing guitar again this summer, Nina, Anthony, and I take time in the evenings to play guitar and sing. Now Nina has a microphone to sing her two favorite songs--"Dreamland Express" and "A Song for All Lovers" (or as she calls it--her "Alaska" song). We just got a Raffi music book in the mail and she thinks it's a lot of fun to laugh as I try to figure out the chords.  Her Papa and Gramma got her a "souped-up" Hover Vacuum cleaner--so she can chase me around the house when I'm doing my chores. It SUCKS--I mean, really...the darn thing actually works! (My brother's joke.) They also got her a giant puzzle and this very cool reading/writing electronic book-thing that has a lot of books and activities to choose from. She traces the letters, words, etc. and it reads them back to her. There are lots of games and ways to interact with the stories. She had NO problem taking to it and her focus was amazing.  Last but not least, I got her a Delux Kitchen set-up that puts my own kitchen to shame. Nina spends a lot of time doing imaginative play and has been getting things out of my kitchen to make "meals" for her animals and babies. Thank God my Dad was here to help put the darn thing together. It has a mini-light above the sink, a cell phone that lights up and beeps, buttons that beep for the microwave, another set of buttons that beep on the oven, the stovetop sizzles...well, you get the picture. She has been busy, busy, busy making all sorts of meals.  This summer, Nina embarked on her first "big girl school" adventure at Storybook Cottage. She is officially a "pre-schooler" and had no problem transitioning into the new environment. We're all very proud of her.  Nina continues to light up our hearts with her belly-laughs, questions about the world around her, the songs she sings, and her genuine affection for those who love her.  Happy Birthday Nina Alyssa!  Love, Mama

						   The last weekend in July, Anthony, Nina, and I had the unique opportunity to go out on the Monterrey Bay Pennisula and go fishing. We ended up catching 30 fish total--many varieties of rock cod including "olives", "blues", "ling", and bright red ones who's names escape me. They made for some very tastey eating. Special thanks to the Livingston family who made our trip lots of fun. We had quite a "fish fry" at their home near Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park overlooking Santa Cruz.

      Hello, I'm Anthony. These are the things that I did for Summer 2004.  First of all, I went to summer school to take enrichment classes. My classes were Art, Drama, Computers, and Science. I made clay pots, crystals(made of salt), paper cups, clay boxes, and many other things. In computers I learned how to use PowerPoint, Hyperlink, and practiced typing. Since my Mom was teaching Drama, I was her teacher assistant and helped her with papers and with one of the students who didn't have a partner. I also got to goof around on her computer and saw some really funny movies.  This year I got to go to Legoland with my Dad. I went on the dragon, and the technic ride. I also got knights kingdom stuff. I also went camping to Lake Francis and had fun with my friend Ashly.  After Summer School I went whith my Mom to the 2004 AVID Institute at the Sacramento Convention Center. I went to Starbuck's for a frapaccino, and took pictures of artwork and architeture around the building. Mom even let me lay on the floor to take pictures of this weird sculpture thing on the ceiling.  We also went to San Francisco and used our family card to go to the Exploratorium. My favorite parts were the echoing tube, a smoke ring maker, and a noise maker. on the way back, we went to Muir Woods.  Then we went over to Santa Cruz with our friends Mark, Corey, Jim, William, and Wesley. They have a really big house where we went to a chili cook-off and went swimming. Then we got to go out on their family's boat called "Hot Tuna". I caught 6 fish in total, one of them was my very first fish that was 11 inches, and the rest were bigger and bigger. The best part was driving a boat. I felt nervous first, but then I felt fine.
