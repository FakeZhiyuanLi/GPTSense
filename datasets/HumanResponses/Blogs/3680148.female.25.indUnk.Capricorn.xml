      The beers (Crest?) are on ice ... the Sloan tabs are being downloaded (and hopefully being learned!) ... the idea to top the T-Shirts is in the works ... as the water in Muskoka warms up and the boats are all gassed up ... it's time once again for the annual Sloan weekend. This year marks the 4th Annual and we are gathering more and more potential Sloan fans. Though I might not win any tickets and the chicken dance will most likely not make an appearence ... we will rock the dock just the same. So get excited now folkies!! Here are some memories from last year: (ok this is the part when I read the instructions about posting pictures I guess!!)

       urlLink    Here are the masterminds behind the Sloan Weekend.  Jeff and I came up with the shirts, and they were big hits ... though I still don't understand why "Chester the Molester" didn't go over well.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    And here is the most excited of the bunch... my little sister.  Lyd - the fact that you sang along with every word and wanted to play cards on the dock with Chris only proves what a die-hard fan you really are!&nbsp; urlLink

      I spent a wonderful weekend at the cottage enjoying the sun and somewhat warm weather (yeah for Canadian summers!)&nbsp; I have about a million new freckles, but in the processed burnt every part of my body (guess sunscreen was invited for a reason for little fair people like me!)   On Sunday I went for a round of golf with my dad at the local course.&nbsp; Tres fun but I was very surprised to see a golfer walking around the course with no shoes on.&nbsp; For a while they threw some shoes on for the greens, but by the end of the game the shoes were off for the entire thing.&nbsp; I would have complained about this class-less act to the Ranger or Owner - if it hadn't have been ME!&nbsp; (I guess this will teach me to remember my golf shoes next time!&nbsp; My feet are insanely blistered from trying to borrow my sister's shoes! haha&nbsp; But honestly it was the BEST way to play golf - so relaxing and so daring!&nbsp; Highly recommend it!&nbsp; My game improved because I was so relaxed!)   Thursday I had an amazing time out and about with the old gang for Edwina's going away party.&nbsp; It was so nice to see some familiar faces.&nbsp; I have some awesome pictures and I will post them as soon as our computer is back from the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina's departure just marks another kid to leave the nest (Tara is already in Australia).&nbsp; Though Moonstone, Jeff and Liz are still here - they won't be for long!&nbsp; I'll miss you guys!&nbsp; Perhaps I need to take off somewhere fun!   Congrats also go out to Ali on her engagement to Colin!&nbsp; How fantastic!   And that is my life in a nutshell!

      As I'm sitting with three friends and the lights go down in the theatre I begin to wonder - what on earth am I doing at a play I know nothing about and getting excited to see the director who isn't even fucking there (further reinforcing the fact that he was never there... "isn't he supposed to be here to direct?")&nbsp; As the audience twists and turns in the ever growing colder theatre I become acutely aware of the fact that Edwina's parking meter is about to expire and she will leave - and most likely never come back.&nbsp; As she slips out of the theatre, purse in hand,&nbsp;and I hatch up my own escape plans, I&nbsp;realize that I was correct in my earlier assumption.&nbsp; (My mind also wanders to how lucky it was that the appetizers and beer arrived when they did, and that those who went AWOL own me a beer!!!)&nbsp; The play eventually comes to an end (despite vicious rumours of an early curtain call) and I know that I have no idea&nbsp;what the play was about.&nbsp; The lights fade on the show (and on my friendship with the director??&nbsp; and with those who accompanied me that evening??) and&nbsp;I realize the good thing about it all is that it has been a while since I have been this inspired to write!!  &nbsp;  Thanks to the ladies - I owe you one - and thanks to the boy for good intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though my bitterness will most likely be gone by the morning - the $16 hole in my wallet will not!

      Tres exciting weekend - felt like a tourist here in my own city. On Friday night Moonstone and I tried out the Summerlicious special in the Distillery District (v. good), and then it was off to the Fringe Festival for Steve Scheffer's and Phil Connell's play GBS. It was amazing and the winner of the "Patron's Pick" award. On Saturday night it was off to Hawksley Workman's concert at the Street Festival with Jeff. Hawksley was on fire! I have decided that Hawksley is the new love of my life - that is if Mr. Lonely is already taken! (Photo to follow!) Missed the Indy on Sunday - which is alright cause I wasn't really up to paying $40 for people watching. Sat around instead with Brendon and drank copious abouts of beer - gotta love hot summer days! I am also in the process of trying to learn a song on my guitar for the Sloan weekend! Not going so well I must admit - but that could be due to the fact that I only pick up the guitar once a week for 5 minutes!   And that was my weekend in a nutshell!   In case you want to check out some more blogs (and basically so I don't forget their addresses!) here are two more:   urlLink http://edoggacheson.blogspot.com   urlLink http://jjforms.blogspot.com &nbsp;

      Went out last night with Mr. McCormack & co. for a "Mickey and a Movie".  Honestly - the best fun I have had  ... well since my weekend long party in 'Toon-town (that's Saskatoon for those non-Westies).  We saw DodgeBall which was tres funny - despite the fact that we showed up too late and had to sit in the very front row.  (Neck braces are in order)  Thanks for the awesome idea Jeff - proud to say that I am moving wonderfully this AM and am off to the dentiste in a couple of hours!  Otherwise not too much else new.  Had a wonderful Canada Day up at the cottage.  A little R&R was in order!  Got in 3 rounds of golf (two of which were disastrous!) and about a million more freckles.

      Well I did it.  I officially pulled the chute yesterday and handed in my two weeks notice (it felt so weird to hand over an envelope - I thought it only happened in the movies!!).  After two years at AGF it was time to make a change.  Although I will miss the peeps there, I am really excited about starting a new adventure.  On September 1st I will be starting at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (say that three times fast).  I am really excited about it.  Everyone in the office speaks German all the time and I will only be working 4 days a week.  The plan is that I will try to start my Masters in German part time and work on that the 5th day.  I just can't believe it.  I woke up this morning to the thought that I am no longer employed at AGF (well after my 2 weeks are up) It just doesn't seem real.  But as my favourite saying goes - I do not regret the things I've done.  Don't look back - you're not going that way!

      Well we have come to the end of another Sloan Weekend - and what a weekend it was.  The neighbours have been appeased (after a 3am shouting fest from the Man Voice - "Ann and Lyle it or ...."), the gymnastic style wetsuits (what a party game that was) have been put away for another year, and the copious number of wine bottles and beer bottles returned!  We all learned that Crest is the work of the devil (but fuels an amazing game of Celebrity Smack-down - I'd like some proof that Uncle Hans exists!) and we'll have to teach Ellen and Catherine the new running/dodge game in the cottage.  The Sloan concert itself left much to be desired - but meeting the band after was AMAZING! The $175 taxi ride was made enjoyable with Boston songs ("More than a feeling"??) and Ellen's rendition of a song we will never know.  The midnight grazing of a family size serving of lasagna, followed by some 'smores and a "dip" in the lake were also enjoyable moments for me.  Thanks guys for the amazing weekend - and always remember - Compliance Rocks!  See you next year.  (Photos to follow when I get them from Jeff)
