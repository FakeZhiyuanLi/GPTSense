      good day to yee folks,  Aite well my day started around 1:30 ish am! well me and my weird sister,(vicky) watched butterfly effect and it was pretty scary, lol even tho it was my 3rd time watching it! Hehe the movie itself was pretty good but was hard to understand the first time.  After the movie it was about 4 or 5 am already!! and we kept turning the volume down incase it was our parents!! Alas... it was only our dear sister with a full blader (my sisters have a semi detached room with a bathroom as the connection between the 2 room) yeah so she kept us awake during the movie or else we would have dosed off....  lol! after the movie of course i went to sleep but woke up at 12 and watched one of my favourite shows.....can you guess??? "Are you ready Kids?!?","Aiye Aiye captain","I can't heeeeeeear you!".. and you know the rest!  lol, dang it why wouldn't the sky just cry!!(as in rain) lol well atleast i did wut i had to do... i mowed le lawn!! and it was crap.  I did the front in smashing time, but the back took a little longer. See i almost mowed 2 baby rabbits over!!! lol one was hiding in this tiny bush beside our monkey bar ladder and the other one was on the other side!! I mowed beside them and didn't  see them. one ran for these set of bushedlol so i chased him around hoping to catch him and put him out side our yard but that little bugger  was fricken fast! lol it went into these random bushes so i was like aite. and when i went back to mowing the lawn, another one of those crazy baby rabbits came out of nowhere and pracitcally chased me into hiding.. lol! well it was sitting there and then ran out almost into the lawn mower and i was like "crap!!" and had to like almost throw the lawn mower out of the way.. well after that incident i decided to wait a bit before i finished up.   I went inside after wards and was about to shower when JOEY!!!! called for my other sister SAMMIE!!!! who after few minutes picked up the phone and sounded half drunk..(probably tired, and if she's reading this.. don't kill me for calling you drunk... hehe lol!)hehe and thats how the cookie crumbles.  Remember guys,  life is tough, so stay frosty peace out !
