      Yes, I'm using the words of "The Internationale" for my Article titles. I thought it appropriate. For those who are interested, it's a song by Billy Bragg. He does great demonstration music. I recommend it, especially the "Red Flag".  The Socialist Ideology is horrendously complex, but it can be summed up into these basic views; That both Feudal and Capitalist society are aimed at meeting the demands of a small upper layer of society (the Bourgeoisie), and oppress the workers (the Proliteriats). The ideology is suited to the belief that the means of production, and some of the services and means of distribution, should be in the hands of collective and cooperative ownership.  There have been some misconceptions as to what a socialist is. The Nazi party in Germany assumed the name of the "National Socialist Party". This, however, is innaccurate, as the ideology of Nazism and that of Socialism conflict, and their respective supporters are clear about the gap. Thus, a socialist is not a Nazi; Quite the opposite.  Interestingly, this point can be linked again with "The Internationale", in which Bragg sings "Let Racist ignorance be ended, for Respect makes the empires fall".

      Welcome to the New Socialist Order Blog. There is a reasoning behind this being a blog - I can't afford to make a real website. Not the point. The message is what is important.   All too often the term "Socialist" has been loosely applied to numerous groups - amongst them reformists, democratic socialists, Marxists, communists and sometimes anarchists. There must be a clear distinction. I am intending on making this clear cut in this blog. I'm also going to describe my personal views. I invite any of you to comment, and e-mail me if something catches your interest.

      You guys are horny teenagers. Dear God, why can't anyone my age keep their pants on? Love, love, love. I've been with my boyfriend 2 years. All you whipper snappers have no clue ;) Why can't two lovers just act like friends sometimes. My boyfriend and I act stupid. Yesterday we were snapping each other with towels (he's better at it, but I got in some good cracks myself). We left some marks, but that's part of the fun. We'll tease each other and play fight and have little food fights and generally act like two 7 year old boys. Sad, I know, but more fun than I have any time else. I'm tired, we went to Wendy's (it's a fast food place if you didn't know) last night around 11 with a friend of ours (who owns a car (even though it is ugly and and loud and falling apart and obnoxious and therefore wonderful).  My parents were at each other's throats so I opened the cellar door a crack, (they were screaming at each other down there to keep the noise contained a bit) yelled down to them I was leaving, and left.(Ah, the love in this house. No matter, you get used to it after a while and my mom has gotten better because she's suddenly Christian. Weird.) We went through the drive through and sat in the parking lot to eat and some bum came up asking for money for an insulin prescription (although, I'd say his need is not for insulin, but for heroin). Anyways, that was my night. How exciting. Not the best of nights, but I laughed a lot. And that's always good.

      I've not said anything for a while... for that matter, this is one of the least active blogs I've ever seen... BUMP! Perhaps a wake-up call is needed... Or rather, perhaps something interesting to post about is required. My tasks for the holiday: -Make uber-watergun -Make Maps for UT2004 -Make a mess -Buy 10ft wooden pole -Buy 5ft by 8ft rectangle of red cloth -Make oversize red flag -Start Cycling everywhere all the time - Norwich centuary next year! -Become 'fit' -Detox diet -Find APsnail's phone number -Make friends with new people -Listen to more Billy Bragg -Drink massive quantities of tea -Read more than you can possibly imagine  Thus, my schedule is rather full. What are other people's plans for the hols?

      My boyfriend and I were having a little argument and my friend Rachael (whom I've had previous relations with) completely took up the opportunity to hit on me (though argument or not she would have taken the chance). Now granted I would have, but I'm not going to forsake my boyfriend. Never ever. I was shocked. She was climbing all over me, kissed me (which I had to pull away from), held me down. Horny Teenagers.  I can't say it's never been provoked before, I’m not that innocent, but wow. Quite extreme. She says she doesn’t even consider herself bisexual any more, that she’s a lesbian because of me. (I must be that good then ;) ) I’ve done a lot with her, but I won’t put myself in a box defining my sexuality.  Has anything like that ever happened to any of you guys, or am I the one with the crazy/overly affectionate friends? In another situation, it would have been welcomed, but she knows my boyfriend doesn’t approve. Generally great fun :D , but you have to draw the line, right?

      Hmm. We seem to have somehow attracted the attention of a group of Americans... Which is merely odd because we currently have the most depressing blog humanly possible (although I think if I were a walrus I could do worse...)  I'll warn any readers that this blog is VERY VERY slow-moving... best to look at member's individual blogs, and check here for team issues. And, if you like, we may add you to the team! that, or Mail me (dragonRg6@hotmail.com)

      Hey, congrats to the Snail! He's got a girlfriend finally! What's more, it seems he's got a fairly close up experience of her lips. I quote:  AP Snail says: "i've never been kissed so much in my life"  Oddly, it's also made me feel enourmously happy! Isn't life wonderful? It's amazing. Life seems to follow reocurrent patterns - I've had a couple of friends recently acquire partners, and they all follow the same pattern - as I did with my girlfriend! Vive le Life, and ¡La lucha continúa!

      Sigh... the weather's turned. One minuite we're sweating under the blistering heat of the sun, the next, we're sweating under the rolling clouds of a British summer. CURSE THEE, FOUL GODS OF WEATHER!!! British weather may be a stereotype, but I can only see us living up to it. Sigh. However, I am free. Until monday. Curse 6th form Induction. In fact, I'll curse a few more points of disfavour whilst I'm about it. Curse: Mark Wright The BNP That BLOODY CAT Whichever bastard keeps trying to break into our shed Ravioli Boy Racers My mother's compost Dog owners who let their Canine companions shit on the pavement  and finally...

      Some time ago, a friend of my mother was a lecturer at the University. He lost his job after being heard to say "If I could only kill one of them..." Whilst looking out the window at a group of students. Now, I'll immediately state that this friend is  NOT A HOMICIDAL MANIAC . However, I'll admit that I've shared the sentiment numerous times. When groups of people are talking about you in an unconstructive manner, in that excessively-loud, meant-to-be-overheard voice, you start muttering to yourself "Just one...". This thought likely springs from the thought that if you DID kill one, the rest would be far to afraid to try it again. However, I'm a pacifist, and I wouldn't kill one. But my point is, I'd like those people to know that I want one of them dead. Any one.

      "A single Death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic." -  Joseph Stalin   I've just been watching a documentary on the Hiroshima bombing. I'm not ashamed to say that I cried. I know a great deal about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and I've seen many films and documentaries, and read many books on them. All make me sick. None fail to make me cry. The fact that weapons that can cause such devastation, and that can kill so remorselessly are still in existence is simply sickening. I've gone over the tale of the bomb numerous times, and the stories of it's victims. Of the little girl of about 15, who was vapourised, leaving only her lunchbox for her family to find. Of the little 4-year old boy, killed the day after his birthday along with his best friend. Of the old, tired man, dead of burns after the blast, who cherished the watch given to him by his son that is frozen at the exact moment of the blast. 100,000 stories end at that exact moment.   Stalin's statement was wrong. This was not a statistical result, not simply a figure to be added to archives. This was one hundred thousand individual tragedies. Perhaps the most horrifying thing is something I was recently taught in school. "If one country drops a nuclear weapon on another, it's only right that that country can do the same in retaliation. This is Nuclear Deterrence". I believe, that of all the pompous, foolish, irrational or downright stupid statements I've ever heard, this tops all. Nuclear deterrence should not be necessary. We do not need to bomb one another into the ground. What's more, the statement has a serious deficiency. It suggests that if one country drops a nuclear weapon, killing a few million people, it's only right that the victim country kills another few million people in response. That we are this obsessive about our fictions of nationhood, pride and ownership is simply ridiculous. What is a country? It's an area of land marked off by a line on a map. Physically, this line means nothing. The people on one side are the same as the people on the other. Why, then, do both sides persist in killing one another? The differences between them are a few simple fictions created by the country's rulers. That we still consider it possible to cause a disaster such as Hiroshima or Nagasaki today, that we retain weapons capable of killing a thousand times those that died in Japan that summer, is simply horrifying. That nations are still willing to go to war over trifling matters is awful. If peace is a Soldier's Dream, then War is every man's Nightmare. To those who have known war, peace is no longer a mere talisman. The enemy is not who your leader points at, who has crossed your "Borders" or has something your leader desires. The enemy is the man who desires to break that peace that is so valued by some, and that is so carelessly thrown away by others.  I believe that the pinnacle of mankind's achievement will not be a great monument, nor will it be an incredible scientific discovery. I believe that our greatest achievement ever will be the day when a child can ask their parent "What's a war?", and that parent can reply, "War is something you'll never need to know".

      First-person shooters. We've all heard of them, and I'll admit to playing some. However, I am beginning to question the ethics behind some. World War 2 shooters I don't really enjoy, because I know that however badly it recreates the real thing, it's making a game out of a conflict that cost fifty-five MILLION lives. I'm not against the history, I think we should learn from our past mistakes, but some recent events have made me decide that the game corporations should either have tighter restrictions or be a little more concious of what they do. A little while ago, "Operation Desert Storm 2" came out. It basically portrayed all Iraqis as gun-wielding, child-snatching, woman-raping lunatics. To add insult to injury, it was  marketed in Iraq . I think this is a gross insult to the iraqi people. It was out before the war had even started! I have mixed feelings about "Operation Flashpoint". On the one hand, it's not a real war, and it does give a fairly accurate account of a soldier in battle - less the "Medal of honour-esque" mass slaughters, where to make the game interesting, enemy soldiers are killed in vast quantities, impossible for any soldier without a lack of conscience, and more a sort of panic-driven sense of urgency. Flashpoint also shows a more poingiant side to war - I remember a particular clip from it, where after a battle, the camera sweeps over a makeshift cemetry, little mounds of pixellated dirt and crosses. What makes it more effective is as the camera gets closer, we can see dog-tags around the necks of the crosses. However, even Flashpoint has it's less desirable points - first and formost, the portrayel of the Russians as vicious, bloodthirsty invaders (they are, indeed, invaders in the game), and the Americans as Righteous saviours. There is a major problem here - the Russians are likely to be just as bloodthirsty and vicious as the Americans, and both groups are actually invading in the game. It's based around the island of Everon, a fictional landmass in an undefined area of the world. Personally, I love the game - As mentioned earlier, most war-based FPSs just throw vast quantites of enemies about - you kill anwhere between 30 and 100 per level, an almost impossible task. In Flashpoint, you'll rarely see an enemy soldier, much less shoot one - More likely you'll hear the bullets whizzing about you, watch your friends get shot to pieces, and look on in terror as a T-72 tank rolls out onto the road ahead of you. Every now and then, you'll snap off a couple of shots into the undergrowth, just to make yourself feel safe, and once in a while, you'll see an enemy break cover, and fire at him, watch him fall with a small puff of blood, and the have to crawl past him to your next objective. Other features are the fact that your character's heartbeat steadily increases as you run, crawl quickly, or as the combat gets heavier. Another thing Flashpoint included to a greater extent than other games was fear - You actually find yourself afraid you'll get shot. It's quite alarming, being hit - there's a whizzing sound, puffs of dirt walk towards you, and suddenly - Crack! Arg! the screen goes red, and the music takes on a tragic tone, accompanied by a quote by some great figure on the subject of war. Personally, with a few tweaks, I think war based FPSs should be more like Flashpoint, or entirely fictional, like Unreal Tournament. Too much disrespect is implied with 'realistic' games.

      Ok, I have 3 exams left over one and a half days. Clearly, the end of the exams calls for a party. We've got one major hitch: Where? My house is unsuitable because, large as it is, it has three major setbacks: 1) It's big in the wrong dimension - vertically 2) It happens to be populated by my parents 3) Carpets (Use your imagination) Most of my friends houses are similarly restricted. We can't casually comandeer a hall somewhere - Alcohol restrictions. I'm not one to be particularly bothered by this, I'm teetotal, but all my other friends like to drink to celebrate, and obviously don't consider anything a party without the stuff. Also, I'd just like to put in that I really can't understand why people seem determined to get pissed after the exams - or at all. I've been drunk before, and it wasn't a pleasant experience. Then we reach the hangover. Anyway, we can't have a party with no venue and with no booze (as much as I hate to say it), so I suspect we're either going to have to make a new friend, or just celebrate in numerous small parties.

      My computer's developed a bug. It's driving me bloody crazy, every 10 or 15 minutes it closes all the open windows without warning. I've  been trying to kill it for weeks. It's an uphill struggle. At the moment, a metaphorical view of the situation looks something like this:   Windows seems particularly suceptible to these bugs. The problem is, windows files are identified soely by their name, not by their content. Find a program (like MSN messenger) that makes a sound on a regular basis - like when someone contacts you. Go into it's program file, open the sounds folder, and copy a sound from somewhere else in. Next, swap the names of the message sound and your sound around. Voila! MSN makes a new noise. My favourite sound to place here is the LSN (internet game) sound called "Spawn Death", which sounds like my bug (as above) throwing up. Fun! Sadly, the same quality that allows you to alter noises makes windows highly suceptible to viruses. I'm still considering changing to linux... Especially after I found a certain piece of anti-linux propaganda by windows:   I'll leave what I make of that to your imagination. In the meantime, I'm reading an internet cartoon that makes use of the linux penguin, cheerfully dubbed "ted", and am enjoying the experience thoroughly. Also, I recently spoke to one of my friends who's hosted a site with a Provider that runs linux. His site's been up for weeks, it's NEVER encountered a single problem. Impressive.

      This is one thing that I'm really beginning to find confusing. Me and my girlfriend had a fight yesterday. As little as an hour ago, I was still fuming, unwilling to give ground or apologise. Now, I've only spoken to her for 10 mins, and even before we'd started I wanted to apologise, hug her and have it all behind me. How can women have this effect on us? I was horrified a couple of days ago watching a documentary about domestic abuse and watching a reconstruction of a man beating his wife - I had an unbearable urge to break his neck, kick him in the balls and spit on him before he died. I'm starting to get worried. My girlfriend seems to do this without trying - I can never remain angry with her for more than a few hours. With men, oh, easy - I've got an ex-friend who turned against me, who I haven't spoken to or looked at straight for four years - but a woman? Impossible. Why? Isn't life confusing! One minute you couldn't look at someone, the next you want to hug and kiss them! Graaaah!

      My Graphics GCSE was today. The only reason anyone went was because they threatened to kick us out of all our other exams. Technology lessons have been the bane of my school life for the past two years. We've only had a real teacher in the last year, before that ones who had no idea what we were supposed to be doing, and could teach us nothing. Since we've had a real teacher, we've done coursework and coursework only. To add insult to injury, they insisted that all the tech groups do their tech coursework on A3 paper. Until recently (very, very recently), there was only one A3 printer in the school, and that was perpetually out of ink, broken, or being used by one of the other 1,700 students who needed it for vital projects. As a result, everyone's tech coursework was perpetually overdue. Periodically, the head of tech, Ms Dallas, came in to give us a pep talk. At this stage, I'll make it clear that our tech group was entirely comprised of boys. The Textiles group, taught by Ms. Dallas, was solid with girls. She'd come in to 'encourage' us - her word for telling us how much worse we were than her textiles group, how far behind we were, handing out numerous detentions, and then saying in a horrifically patronising tone "I'm only doing it for your own good". Hence, my Technology coursework suffered somewhat, and I doubt it'll achieve so much as a D. Because of the focus on the coursework, we didn't actually learn anything. So, as you can imagine, I wasn't eager to go into the tech exam. The fact is, I hate tech, and I always have. The reason I chose to do Graphics was because we had to do at least one tech and Graphics was the safest. I've loathed tech with them, and I'm appalled at the fact that I'm actually proud that I didn't try very hard in the Graphics exam. Thankfully, I'll never EVER have to do another tech lesson. Isn't life wonderful?

      Ok, after my exams, I'm gonna change as much as possible about my life. Here's a list of eight to-dos - Get Haircut (PRIORITY) - Stop eating/drinking/ingesting e-numbers - Detox diet!!! - Learn a martial art... maybe Kendo... - Learn to play that accursed drum - Start Training for the Norwich Centuary - Stop promising lists of eight points when you can't remember the last one - ummm....  The first one is easy to explain - I've come to strongly resemble a haystack. Simple answer? I want to shave it all off, but my girlfriend says she'll dump me if I do that, so I'll keep most of it for now, and get it trimmed. The second one is because I am sick of teenage spots, and I keep losing my concentration when reading (I imagine because of e-numbers), and I can't sit still, and lastly, I speak too fast, which can cause damage to other's hearing apparatus. The third one is because I need to be able to threaten people with some credibility if I'm to get by in life as a pacifist - y'know, the sort of idiots who hang around popular nightclubs and bars and things, who require an actual demonstration of how much more dangerous you are than him to back off. The fourth point concerns a certain Irish drum that's currently hanging on the wall in our living room. I can't play a single musical instrument, and it's a fairly basic one, so I'm going to learn (also, people keep asking if I can). The fifth one concerns a 100 mile cycle race around Norwich. I want to take part for two reasons - One, I want to do something actually useful and admirable with my life. Two, it'll annoy my girlfriend :D (sorry, love, but it's amusing watching your face when 100 miles on a 'bloody bike' is mentioned). Well, these are my versions of new year's resolutions. Got to make them some time.

      It's a pity I'm using this title here - I wanted to save it for another "Hard-man" bashing, but never mind. I've noticed whilst reading the Communist Manifesto, that in our modern society, proliteriats are somewhat rare. Sure, we have our Bourgeoisie, but where are the proletariats? Simple. Most have moved a rung or two up the ladder. Fewer and fewer are simply the means to an end - most now control their own destiny as much as the rich, although, that being said, a few of the Communist points do still remain valid.      Communist Doctrine: Outdated by modern Production?   With the revelation that there's no-one to fight for anymore, most prospective Socialists and Communists will abandon the cause. I'm not convinced. I believe that Socialism will always be the better system - Just because there's few Proliteriats, doesn't meen that there's no-one being exploited. Perhaps we need to look a rung or two up the ladder. We've recently been inundated by Fire Service Strikes. The Firemen have atrocious pay for people who, on a daily basis, hurl themselves into extreme danger to save others. These people deserve more than simply the gratitude of those they save. These people are the new Prolitariat, the new exploited worker. Perhaps the problem these days is simply a focus on profit, and a deficiency on the people fronts.

      I'm currently doing my GCSEs. I've come to hate my exams. I've a number of points to work on here, so I'll get started. First up, I'm a hayfever sufferer. The exams are in early summer, the time when hayfever is at it's worst. Most of my friends turn out to suffer the same thing; The problem is only enhanced by the fact that my school won't let it's studentss near the school building between exams; We have to sit on the field, which is ringed by hedges and trees. Today, I did my English Language exam, and I can honestly say, I'm sure I buggered it up. I'm positive it's not a good thing for half the students in the hall to be sniffing, rubbing eyes that are itching to the point where they can't see, sneezing copiously, and generally feeling crappy. To compound the problem, it's intensely hot in the exam hall, not helped by the fact that it's bloody boiling outside. Sweaty, itchy, sneezing, squinting students will not achieve success as they might if they weren't any of the mentioned conditions. Yet despite all this, the exam boards persist in insisting that we do our exams in early summer. I am sure it'd be a little more sensible if we did our exams in early- to midwinter, and changed our school year at the same time as the rest of the year. It'd risk more colds, of course, but these are not assured - simply likely. Hayfever is certain, and the number of sufferers is on the sharp increase. My second point of much agitation is that my school is adamant that we are NOT TO BE ON THE SCHOOL PREMESIS EXCEPT IN EXAMS. This statement has numerous faults - to start with, they want us here half an hour in advance of the start of the exam, and often give us two exams a day seperated by about two hours - about enough time for me to walk home, open the door, close the door and walk back to school. In these two hours, I'm not supposed to be on school premises, although they don't mind us being on the field (which as I've already mentioned, is a bit of a bugger), but I can't go home because it'll be a waste of time. So what do I do? I usually just sit on the field. I have to, otherwise I'll be late. I have to endure itchyness and a general feeling of illness throughout the second exam. Sometimes I've been round to a very kind friend's house in between (still a half hour walk, but better than my house). My third problem is that there are two exams a day - one at nine in the morning. It'd be nice if they only ever put one exam up in one day, and in the afternoon, so we could be well rested and prepared for it. Sadly, I get to school tired and irritable, and end up daydreaming precious exam time away. I hate GCSEs. My third problem concerns the school's somewhat lax methods of checking for cheating. This sounds odd, coming from a student, but the measures in place are hardly adequate. I've walked into the exam room without the suspicious bulges in my pockets being checked (hankies - for the hayfever, but they could have writing on, or be notes as far as the exam board are concerned), without the backs of my hands being checked, without the palms of my hands being checked, without the books we're given to use being checked, and all sorts of other things not checked. The person who comes before me in the register seems to get restless a good deal of the time, and often turns around to look at me or his friends - an offence for which we were assured you would be disqualified for. He's not even reprimanded, and a lot of people do it. I'm amazed at how often you could cheat and not be caught, but the teachers clearly don't realise this - perhaps they are sure someone else is covering it, or maybe they've lost all their childish inventiveness, the ability to think of ways to cheat. I don't personally cheat, and I'm not sure any of my friends would, but it'd be sickeningly easy to get away with. The final problem I have is the school's security measures on exam rooms. We've often had year 10s walking past the door open to the outside (it's too hot in the exam rooms, as mentioned. so they attempt to alleviate this by opening a door) shouting at us, or making loud noises in an attempt to distract us (Why? What is their problem? What's to stop us doing this to them next year?). A teacher has always shushed them, but not before the damage is done and you've lost your concentration. Our exam room also has a door to the inside of the school. We've had people knock noisily on this door and run off. This has a similar effect, except of course, the teachers go and check but don't find out, come back in and it happens again. Perhaps it doesn't occur to the teachers to keep someone outside the door preventing idiocy, but sadly, no. There are all sorts of other problems, such as the idiots who come in late, and are led along the front (as they grin manically at having dirupted the exam) to their seat, despite the school's assertion that lateness was not to be tolaerated. These can be left though, I'm sick of this post. Exams aren't exactly my favourite topic. I'm going to get some tea, my nerves need soothing.

      I've been going through and cleaning out my inbox. I'm positively appalled at the number of junk e-mails I have. Who the hell sends these things? Why me? How, despite all my efforts, do they evade the Junk e-mail blocker? This is a monthly thing with me - I open my inbox, select all of the 1,198 e-mails present and delete them. I use hotmail to send and receive e-mails, and all my friends have is my hotmail address. My ISP address is a mystery to me still, as I have no intention of using Outlook Express for more than the 2 minutes it takes me to delete the inbox. I'm amazed that corporations can be this persistent. At first, I sent a polite e-mail to each company from which I recieved mail, asking them kindly to Sod Off. When this failed, I sent slightly less polite messages. Eventually, I resorted to sending downright insulting e-mails. This had quite the opposite to the intended effect -  the companies all seemed to redouble their efforts. Finally, I simply ignored my E-mail, and on a montly basis cleared it for memory space. I've similar problems with my Internet Popups. My popup blocker is ineffectual - I've actually sent a mail message (hotmail, of course) to inform them that their toolbar doesn't actually work; Of course, my response was (surprise surprise) junk mail. I've now taken to repeatedly bashing ALT and F4 whenever I open a new site - shooting as many popups as I can before resorting to point-and-click methods. Perhaps it's just me, but I've noticed that I pay no attention whatsoever to popups. Perhaps this form of ineffectual, irritating advertisment needs to be banned finally. It's a serious threat to my personal sanity (or at least, what remains of it), I can assure you.

      This article has been created largely because I have an insatiable urge to write something under this name. I'm actually wondering about American Patriotism - It seems to me that all Americans, other than the hippies and flagburners, are fierce patriots - this opinion rises from having watched American documentaries and Sitcoms. I don't watch many sitcoms - in fact, I spend all my time reading and writing these articles, but from what I have watched I already know the pledge of alliegence off by heart. I'm now starting to wonder if this widespread Anti-Americanism, along with the views that are presented to us on the Americans are stage-managed views impressed upon us by the mass media. This is the point at which I realise the extent of control the mass media has over our lives. Consider, if the mass media suddenly decides to portray the italians as the bad guys, they could start a war. Clever use of language could achieve what took thousands of lives to do 60 years ago - conquer a country (This is with one exception, and that is the conquest of france. Let's face it, the french army couldn't beat a girl's hockey team, for all they have a good resistance movement). It's incredible, the extent to which media controls our lives. Of course, this could all be a load of dog's bollox, and Americans could really be simple, patriotic lunatics, or it could be a fiendish ploy by the media to impersonate me and fool you into thinking it's trying to fool you into thinking it's trying to change your alliegences, and to confuse you to throw off your suspicions...

      I was recently reading a Douglas Adams book, Specifically the Posthumous work accredited to him,  The Salmon of Doubt , and I came upon a section where Mr. Adams has placed extracts from an interview with 'American Atheist' magazine. Immediately upon finding this, one of my eyebrows rose to giddying heights in incredulity. I was simply amazed that there was a magazine entitled "American Atheist". It struck me as a little petty, to pick on something like that - To me, it would be like calling a magazine "Cereal Eater" or "Bread Purchaser". I've heard of magazines called things like "Machine-Gun Collector" and "Obese Bride", but this was ludicrous. As I read through, I came upon numerous sections like this:   American Atheist:  Have you faced any obstacles in your professional life because of your Atheism (bigotry against atheists) and how did you handle it? How often does this happen?   D. Adams:  Not Even Remotely. It's an inconceivable idea.  Now, what we notice is this: The question suggests discrimination against Atheists. What puzzles me is that I really can't imagine someone having a discrimination against Atheists, or even that there could be a possibility. The chance had never struck me before - To me, someone who was an Atheist was the same as one who was Christian, Jewish, Hindi, Buddhist, Islamic, Sikh, Shintoite or of any other religious disposition -apart from different prayer rituals and times, and perhaps different dietary needs and different places of worship. I was amazed because I really couldn't imagine how someone would discriminate against an Atheist. The Interview also included questions asking how Adams' friends and family had reacted to his being an Atheist. At this point, I started to have an inkling these people were actually searching for a cause to be behind, a form of identity because they were worried about not having one. Instead of worrying about not being anything, they could say "I am an Atheist". I visited the American Atheist website, and discovered, to my consternation, that the magazine was merely a branch of a larger, more complex organisation. No longer "Cereal Eater" magazine, but "Cereal Eaters United" organisation. I'm ever more incredulous - the organisation seems to be an actively funded creation. And we complain about the government wasting money?! The organisation's goal seems to be to make America the ideological Atheist haven. When I originally looked, there was a story on a lawsuit that was struggling to have the words "so help me god", and if possible, the Bible removed from the oath-swearing at the start of a court appearance. I've come to this final, overall conclusion:    Americans Take Religion FAR too Seriously.    also, I'd like to add this footnote to the effect that if anyone is feeling low, or wants a good laugh or something, a good place to start is the news section of the  urlLink American Atheists Website

      I've always found it odd; So many people are anti-American, and I don't want to be, but sadly, I always find myself about to say "An American publisher..." or "The Americans seem to..." or something. I often find myself being a little hypocritical. I defend the Americans, then go on to say something against them. So I'll just clarify why; There are a hell of a lot of Americans. Sure, they're a tiny percentage of the world population, but that's not the point; There are still 290,342,554 plus people (officially) living in America. When we say "Americans" we generally actually mean a small portion of these people. Most Americans are good people. I'm going to write articles from now on without watching my use of the word "Americans", but I'd like to state;  I don't mean ALL Americans  - Only those the specific situation applies to. Thus, When I say "Americans are stupid" (I'm not going to say that), I mean that a considerable quantity of Americans have, on average, a lower than normal intelligence rating. I apologise now to anyone whose feelings I hurt. Either it's the product of a misunderstanding, which is quite probable, or it's actually that I find you aggravating or annoying or you do something which I find monumentally foolish, any of which are less likely.

      It's nice to see that the BNP are floundering once more. I've been looking at their site (Wearing protective clothing), and their policies are more repellant than ever before! Ugh. It's also good to see that the Tories aren't doing brilliantly. Sad to say, but I'm also glad labour have had a kick up the backside - They've done a little good, but predominantly they've been crap, and a government that doesn't listen to it's people deserves to be kicked out. The war in Iraq was a folly, we could all see that. Tony's just folding where Bush points. Are we really that invertibrate? Anyway, it's probably all about oil. I'm ok with the Lib Dems getting seats - They seem to be good people. I'd have voted Green, was I old enough. It's nice that all the small parties are getting a go at the seats for once.

      I'm not fond of football. That's a lie, I loathe it. It's forced upon me at all angles. There seems to be some assumption that all boys love football. Everywhere I walk, I see these little England flags on all the cars (another thing that makes me sick). If I try to talk to someone at school, and say something about France, they immediately tell me they hate France, and then say something to the effect of "because they won the world cup". Often I only get this answer with probing, the primary response being the exact words "because they're French". Often, people don't even hate them because of that. They just, inexplicably, do. Frequently, I get stereotypes thrown at me; There are few stereotypes about the french that are true, other than that they make good wine, enjoy good food, and sell fresh food (a rarity in Britain). Interestingly, the French stereotype of the British male is probably more true. At least, they have good reason to believe that it is. It's something like "All British men are football hooligans" or "All British men are nationalist pigs". It's a pretty good assumption; Often, those you see are in the minority. I'm a British male; Most men I know don't fit this stereotype. However, it's hard not to have the opinion that it's true forced upon you from walking around in Britain, and those that go over to France and other European countries whilst wreaking havoc in their path must make this all the more true to outsiders. My mum goes to football matches. She wears a "Zinedine Zidane" shirt. She's often had comments made on this matter, and many times they're not constructive, or even pleasant ones. My grandfather isn't a football fan - like me - but has a tendancy to wear whatever shirt comes to hand. He lives in france, and is the quintessential frenchman. He's often accidentally donned an england football shirt, and absent-mindedly wandered around his home town, gone shopping, or otherwise. He never recieves strange looks, unpleasant comments, or anything of the kind, whilst in France. It's most odd. Perhaps we British have too large a national ego - We're not the best, we're not even great. We've commited our fair share of atrocities in our time. We side with the Americans over everything because we're too spineless to stand up for ourselves. I must say, my national pride lies soely in the hands of the National Health Service, nowhere else.

      I've had it with my school. I've never liked it, but this is just ludicrous. Recently, a 'Senoirship' system was installed. From the outset, when it was described to us with relish by our somewhat draconian deputy head, Ms. Seddon, it sounded terribly like prefecthood. In fact, it is prefecthood. They select people they favour out of the year 10s, and give them a little badge, plus more responsibility (such as reporting misbehaviour) and in return gain priveleges. Now of course, they were instantly unpopular with many people. I'm not the sort of person who goes around bashing little kids noses for their lunch money; In fact, I'm the sort of person who has his nose bashed for his lunch money, but that's besides the point. Prefecthood is an outdated Eliteist system that has no place in modern society. What our school is trying to do is create the new social elite, that is, the new Bourgeoisie. Interestingly, many parents think it's a wonderful system. Almost naturally you'll find that those who agree with it were once prefects themselves. It's incredible, the school puts you together and tells you to play as a team, and then snatches one of you and hurls them in to a position of authority. Now, imagine the demoralising effect this will have on the other students. It'll probably boost the results of the seniors themselves, as they've effectively been told they're 'better' than other students, but it has a reaction in those not chosen as well. It's something that those chosen are being allowed to put on their permenant records - a fact that I think is absolutely horrendous, as the choosing was basically those that some teacher favoured. This is social stratification and Teacher labelling on a vast scale, and done officially. I think City of Norwich school should hang it's head in shame. It's perpetuating the Class Strata that have been present in our society for so long. I was a little alarmed when many of my friends were chosen, which could have caused a rift between us, indeed between the whole school and the seniors, but thankfully I am glad to say that my friends were corrupt to the point of insolence, and eventually, the system  was effectively gone. Seniors were still there in name, but they were no different to the rest of us. Those that attempted to flaunt privilege were quickly 'discouraged', and now the system has been handed down to the year below, who are, if anything, even more corrupt that we.  In light of a comment made, perhaps it's appropriate to add that the privileges were to be a room ('Base') where the seniors could go when off duty, and relax and play music and such. this was in fact never put into action, because it quickly became evident that people didn't take the system seriously. Seniors just tried to get people they didn't like into trouble, and were generally powerless to stop real troublemakers, who often threatened lone seniors into silence.

       Yup. This time for the girls...  Issue 1) Guys only ever want sex. Chauvinist pigs. Make them wait. Issue 2) Seduction is unfairly easy. Make use of it. Issue 3) If he's mucked you about before, or cheated on you, he doesn't exist. Issue 4) Don't love them. Issue 5) If you really must, always wait until you know exactly how he feels before telling him that you love him. Issue 6) Let him know early on if you don't want him looking at other women - then slap him if he does. If he thinks you're in the wrong after this, dump him. Issue 7) Don't think about him like that. Issue 8) Be as malicious as you like - he'll stay with you if he really cares for you. Issue 9) Don't give him a blow job. Seriously, male sexual organs are vile. Even being male, the mere thought of such an activity disgusts me. Issue 10) Don't get him drunk. Guys are obnoxious at the best of times, drunk is just sick.

      If you haven't read "Boredom" yet, do so then go on to this.  In light of my previous post, I'd like to add the following: My perception of images I make in my mind is automatically influenced by external sources; To complexify, if I listen to happy music, the images will be sunny, the people friendly, and generally the world a good place, perhaps with a tinge of sadness if it's a rainy day. If I watch a comedy film just before hand, the images will be comical, usually suddenly sharply turning to the serious when something like the news comes on.  So here's my next thesis: Sensory Deprivation. What will happen if there is nothing to influence me? The images can't stop; I create those. So, will my world be white, blank, and empty, or just a void?  And more complex still, what if I play happy and sad music at the same time? Will my world be split down the middle, or will it be a complicated mass of emotions and thoughts?  And a another question. Look at the nearest door. Close it. Now look again. What's outside? Your hallway? The kitchen? Does it need to be? Can't it be, say, the door on a ship? Can't it lead into a cupboard somewhere?  Now, the last point. We all do this, I realise. So, the final, most inexplicable question: Why do we get bored?

      I just found myself sitting, staring off into space and thought: "Gee, I'm bored." Instantly, I was assailed by such a spray of less coherent thoughts that I reeled breifly, before vertibly throwing myself at my keyboard. Boredom: Why do we experience it? I have discovered that I cannot explain this. We are such interesting creatures. Next time you are bored, think about yourself. What are you? you are, as you see it, two light-sensitive organs picking up images. These images are you; they are your universe; Do other people realise this? Do other people see the same things as me? Is what I see as green what, through the eyes of another, I would call purple? You simply have to wander through the galleries of your mind to find interest at every turn. Boredom is something that we create when our brains are feeling lazy. Kick it into action! I've been up to this for an hour now, and have made many interesting discoveries; I can't feel the top of my head, there's an itch under my right knee, My left big toe feels dented, all sorts! It's incredible, but I feel more aware of myself and my surroundings. I believe this is similar to what would be described as meditiation - I'm a fairly lax buddhist, and I've felt like this before, after meditation. The difference? Then, I was eager to try something new. This time, I was bored.  You can do all sorts of things when you are bored. When you read something, a text without images, your mind automatically creates an image of what it's like, even if it's not fully described. Observe: An ageing, thatched in on the road to london, in the year 1673. Barkeeper is a rounded, balding chap called Philip Brown. There is a large, whitewashed stable at a right angle to the main building, jutting out off the back. Several chickens peck at the ground in the front yard. The sign creaks on it's hinges. Now, your mind will instantly picture this, although doubtless differently as to how mine does. For example, I said nothing about the weather, the interior, the landscape, the construction of the walls of the inn, the roof of the stable, wheather or not there are other customers, the image or text on the sign, etc, yet doubtless your mind will instantly have created these figments. For some reason, I see grey skies, rain, a couple of unsavoury chaps, wooden walls, a wood on the horizon but fields all around, a wooden interior lit by small oil lamps and varnished to a shine, and an almost obscenely friendly barkeeper. Doubtless you see different. But whatever. Now, let's see... Picture a bustling city. Already you have an image in your mind, so I'm going to alter it by saying it's during the industrial revolution. Once more, many will automatically conjour up an image without further prompting. What I want to know is this: Without prompting, I automatically find that there are roads, alleyways, people, buildings, doorways and the like in my new city - Interactable objects. And so I ask myself, "what's down that alleyway over there?". I instantly see a dark alley, that is hemmed in by walls on three sides. It's got a muddy floor, some pallets leaning against the left wall, a couple of barrels and a door on the right. There's a small cat sitting on one of the barrels. The cat is grey. I could go on forever, telling you about this alleyway. So, what's through the door? A warehouse. Stacked with sacks. Burlap sacks. Rats, about three, sit on the floor in a heap of grain, and look up at the doorway as I step through. I'll stop there, but the point is, why do I need to have something to do? Anyone can have a massive adventure by simply following these question-answer-description tactics. You can create mindmaps of massive environments, horrible monsters, clever characters, magical devices, dream homes, dream holiday destinations, idyllic worlds, without walking more than a pace or two to a chair. Why are we ever bored? There are infinite worlds at our disposal, we can create or destroy, recreate, build, grow, define as we like in these worlds. Who could ask for more? Try it some time. Please respond.

      I'll start by saying this: No offence meant, this probably doesn't apply to all described persons. I would like to add that several of my friends and family drive white vans, so I'm not just being discriminative. There must be another defining factor.  I just got back from a road journey, specifically to collect my grandfather from the airport.  On the way, we were cut up by 6 white vans. 8 on the way back. Don't we all writhe in fear with the chance of coming upon a white-van man? Usually, he's a balding, middle-aged, aggressive looking bloke with a habit to shout silent abuse at everybody. He's the terror of the roads - The automobile equivilent to the Hound of the Baskervilles. I'm not sure how this strange occurence comes to be, but it's practically always true. I'm a keen cyclist, and I've nearly been killed by White Van Man so many times that my head spins with nausea at the near misses I've had. I wish to ask a simple question of the general public: What is it that causes the notorious "WMV" to be so? Why is he so aggressive? What is his reasoning for being an unpleasant sod of a driver? Why is he always male? Please contact me.

      Yes, it seems I'm focusing on bullying; There's a reason for this, and it's that one of my friends is bullied, and I'm fascinated by the mindset of such fiendishly stupid creatures. From my observations, I have concluded that bullies bear striking resemblence to sheep in their activities. You will notice that passing a bully in the corridor alone, he or she will not say or do a thing. This is because alone they feel threatened. When a non-physically violent bully is alone, they are safe to approach and make fun out of. Sheep have a similar mentality. To combat this, bullies move around in packs, flocks, or herds. Now, to outwit these simple creatures, you must simply do as with sheep - Move around a lot with a pack of aggressive dogs using wolf whisles periodically.  There are several different organisational forms that bullies travel around in. Anything above 2 bullies is considered a "crew" by themselves, as to simplify things for their lower mindset. This organisation is also used by other different strata of society (those above "animalistic"), so apologies to anyone who thinks of themselves as part of a "crew" - it's purely scientific, I assure you.  Organisational format:  'Vulnerable': 1 bully - danger rating - minus 12 (go for it) 'duo': 2 bullies - danger rating - 1 (irritating) 'Bunch': 3 bullies - danger rating - 4(Damn irritiating) 'gang': 4-5 bullies - danger rating - 8 (threat to mental health) 'Gathering':6-7 bullies - danger rating - 13 (threat to physical health) 'Posse': 8 or more bullies - Danger rating - 20 (run for your life)  Name calling is the most common form of bullying, and is easily combated by ignoring them. Should this fail, or if they proceed to Physical abuse, I encourage swift telling of teachers or parents. For adults, well, deal with it. If this still fails to take effect, swift and harsh retribution with a counterposse armed with crowbars is usually effective.

      Forgive the gradoise title; It's a good way of getting attention. An interesting new film has just come out - "The Day after Tomorrow". Not intersting as in it's a good film, in fact it sounds pretty awful, but as someone I know stated: "The best thing about it is that it'll probably make those Americans pay attention to Global Warming". The owner of this statement is a known anti-American, but still, it's primarily true; America is the greatest producer of greenhouse gases, and also coincidentally the nation to do the least about it. Before I go any further, I'd just like to say that I'm not accusing America of being monumentally un-ecological, although it's far from innocent. China has it's Three-Gorges Dam project, which is fraught with problems and controversy and Britain has a serious litter problem. In fact, I'm rather ashamed to admit that many of my associates are litterbugs. Coincidentally, those who comment on the Americans being (and these aren't my opinions) Stupid and Obese. I deplore littering, especially as, and here is the part that makes me wince with pain, about 40% of it is done within 10 feet of a bin. Recycling is hardly well publicised, and we are STILL driving gas-guzzling monsters, jamming the roads with traffic and failing to use public transport. There is little in the way of solar power plants (interesting fact: a solar plant could produce about twice the electricity of a nuclear power plant of the same size with no waste products, and is far safer), and windfarms aren't common. Why, the people cry?  I'll tell you why.    It Costs The Government Too Much.    Now, I don't want to be too critical - actually, that's a lie - but all I can say to the government, and indeed the public, is  GET A BLOODY GRIP!  Money is a fiction. It is a man-made fiction we are all subscribed to. Look at a handful of cash. What is it? METAL and PAPER. Some isn't even that, some is merely small electronic charges in a computer system somewhere . It's not vastly important. If we intend to survive long into the future, we need to start doing things 'for the greater good', not for "Money". This is where the idea of Communism flies to the forefront of the Battle for Earth - if we are to save this planet, if our great-great-great grandchildren are to have a home, we must DISPENSE WITH MONEY. We must look at the fiction, and discard it for fact. So, the reason the government doesn't do what it must to save the earth? Because it hasn't got a big enough pile of metal, paper, and small electric charges. I'm not suggesting we dispose of all currency - perhaps ration tokens like those in the war could be used for amenities like food - but I am suggesting that perhaps honour should be a greater form of reward than money. Someone who distinguishes themselves in some way could have a title added to their name, or an honourific third name (this is actually a system described in one of Robert Jordan's  Wheel of Time  series). Materieal wealth is an inefficient measure of someone's worth. I recommend thinking on this one, and  Vive le Revolution!

      I've witnessed this many times. Walk along the street, and count how many men swagger. I can Bet you money it will be 80%. Me and my friends have come to view this as the "hard man" phenomenon. This can be seen in the most extreme in those called "Townies". Personally, I hate that phrase, but the definition, vauge as it is, has been proven to me many times. Personally, I think that by educating our nation's youth about being a "hard guy" perpetuates bullying and delinquance in boys.  I have a perfect example of how this kind of attitude. A friend of mine (let's call him... John)and I were walking somewhere across Norwich, where we live. Along the pavement, in the opposite directions, come a group  of three boys. The biggest is probably about 9 and is maybe 4'5 tall. The smallest is around three feet(yes) tall and looks to be four or five years old. add to point that they are all swaggering. As we pass, the smallest yells "You've dropped your gay card" at us, and, failing to elicit a response repeats his exclamation a couple of times. We walk by ignoring them thoroughly. Now, here is the heart of the matter. I am about 6 feet tall. 'John' is taller still. as I have already stated, the smallest, who shouted the attempted insult at us, was perhaps 3 feet tall, not even half either of our heights. He had clearly been brought up with little respect for strangers, and very probably under the "hard man" assumption. The thing was, if 'John' had taken it into his mind to extract revenge for the insult (I am a devout pacifist), he could very easily have beaten the boy to a pulp and hurled him over the hedge, and his little friends would have been of little help. To make the situation worse, 'john' was carrying a baseball bat. Fortunately, he's almost as passive as I, otherwise the situation could have been nasty. Afterwards, we reflected that the child must have had a less-than-adequate social upbringing, or must have been very VERY sure of his 9-year-old brother's combat prowess. We finally came to the conclusion that the first was correct, although probably mixed in with a large, aggressive father or other brother. Interestingly, the Native American Indians gave their children toys to play with that suited their role in later life. Boys had toy warriors, girls toy teepees and dolls. These days we often see articles about how "Violent Crime is on the increase" or how "Boys are underachieving in school" and (most famously) "Teenagers are surly uncooprative bastards" (I'm one of them). I think this is probably true because of our upbringing. I imagine that the child who attempted to insult "John" and I played with action men, or played violent, aggressive computer games (although I suspect this aspect is overly presented as the cause by the press). I also imagine that his father had a similar (if less technologically advanced) upbringing. Interestingly, my mother (single parent) deplores violence, and never bought "Action Man" dolls or the like for me as a child. As has already been mentioned, I am a devout pacifist. I am not saying I am a perfect example, but I have numerous friends with a similar upbringing ('john' amongst them) who are also pacifists. Perhaps we need to change the manner in which our society brings up and educates our children in the early stages, or maybe encourage toy companies to produce more constructive toys (lego and k'nex) and less "Hard-Man" inducers (like Action man), and even "little Angel" inducers like Barbie dolls.

      Those expecting communism from my blog so far are doubtless disappointed. I apologise, I'll start with the non-totalitarian red tide now. Oh, and by the way, I know nothing of communism. I'm hoping someone'll help me out. I have a hell of a lot to say on this issue, so I'll start with the basics: Capitalism. Now obviously, by nature anything concerning ying must concern yang. So it follows with Communism and Capitalism. I really want to know why every single book, film, and television program depicts Russians or other communist nationals as Low-brow, soul-sucking monsters. It's almost like the "Unter-Menschen" of the Third Reich, which of course, no-one would agree to wishing to recreate. I will grant you, the Soviet Reigieme was a little extreme, but still... Another type of the "Unter-Menschen" portrayal seen in modern-day western society is the way the onset of Communism is called the "red tide". Now, for countries forcibly subjected to it, I can understand this, but many willingly adopted Communism, which brings me to my last point: If it's so bad, why's it so popular? Perhaps the reason for this is because (and I'm gonna use America as an example here because it's predominantly true) the governments that don't want Communism to take a hold in their countries portray Communism in the "Unter-Menshen" light, and don't educate their people as to what it entails. I think a country where everyone is treated as equals would be an incredible achievement in the chronicles of humankind. Obviously a dictatorship is out of the question; it would have to be Democratic Communism, a concept by which anyone has the right to run for head of state. Crime would be practically wiped off the face of the nation, because if everyone is entitled to the same privileges, then no-one should desire more or less than any other, as there will be no-one to steal from because they will have the same as you. Obviously, there would have to be a very carefully structured government, and a careful judicial system. I'll continue this train of thought another time, but I'll leave it to mull over.  A last addition: One of my friends states this: "Communism is Brilliant. It conquers many of the problems in our society. On paper it's the way forward. It fails because of People, who cannot accept equality with their neighbours."

      I don't like to think that I'm the subject of bullying, less still that I actually do any of it - I'm not a tough person, so I find it hard to stand up to people, and I tend to prefer evasion to confrontation - but, once more, as I moan to my friends, I realise that they've done it again - Those idiots have somehow got through to me. My problem concerns a group of people (I will refrain from calling them idiots - damn) who were once my friends. In Middle school (that is school from roughly age 8-12... I think... for those in the US), I spent most of my time with a group of about 4-5 of the same people. They were my friends. Then, in the second year of high school, they... turned against me. That is to say, they started calling me names (things like "mop top" - I do have somewhat uncontrollable hair, but still), and even developed a set of hand signals so they could communicate silently over a distance. It sounds childish, but it really pissed me off. What drove me more mad was the way they would shout my name at me everywhere I went, and make meant-to-be heard comments about me... Here's where I started to question this. Why? Don't they get embarassed? Can't they think of anything less pleasant to do to me? I am still confused by this. I always read about times when bullies would shove their victim's heads down toilets, or spit on them, or something, but this was just childish. However, what bothered me even more was... It got to me. At this point, I started developing the "White Mask" tactic - That is to say, they don't exist. I convince myself that I can't see or hear them, and it helps me get by. There are side effects; whenever someone yells my name, I immediately blank them, and often miss one of my friends shouting something helpful or friendly; but never mind. So it'd be all very well if it was just this group of idiots (whoops). BUT it's not. Vast herds of year 9s and 10s (i'm a year 11, so this'll sound wimpy) roam our school, and everywhere they go, they push other people around and try to make people's lives miserable. I get "Mullet" shouted at me constantly. I am told this is because of my haircut - Which, I might add, is DISTINCTIVELY NOT A MULLET. And once more, the question floats across my mind like an oil slick: Why? What pleasure do these asshats (I love that insult) find in making people's lives miserable? Why do they do it? What purpose do they achieve by pissing me and THOUSANDS of others off? Now, the major trouble here is that the usual advice, admonished to us by our parents and teachers - "Tell Somebody" or "Tell a Teacher" - is ineffectual. In the first incidence I described, the idiots (there I go again) involved are too intelligent to do it in front of a teacher, and there is no proof. All that can be done is for a teacher to tell them to stop it. This will doubtless do nothing, and probably will cause them to redouble their efforts. However, this can be dealt with, although it may require some administrative help from parents and teachers, to carefully 'rearrange' things so you don't come into contact with them. At breaks, this can be unavoidable, but some things are better left alone - Try the white mask, for example. The second incidence is far more subtle and complex, however, as it is not any specific person targetting any other. These are simply unpleasant people who roam around making the lives of those they come into contact with unbearable. My solutions are generally violent or illegal, and so cannot be put into practice because I'm a pacifist and I like to obey the law. How do I deal with this?

      Ok, I'm new to this, I really just want somewhere to post my thoughts, so this may: A) make no sense B) be somewhat confusing or C) be deadly boring; I'll open by apologising to the real David McCarter, whoever and wherever you may be - internet security and all that, I'm quite happy for you to appropriate my name in the name of the same cause. If you can guess it. So, some important information. I'm: -lazy -male (these first two seem to come in unison) -Obsessive -irrational and -I talk to myself. Just to warn you about what's coming.

      Well, I'm sure all my thousands of loyal fans will be pleased to know that I'm back, and I intend to post more often. Sorry about the long silence, I've been busy (Girlfriend time, Computer problems, Holidays, Cat, Friends, more Girlfriend time, Parties etc).  Well, I believe I once stated the following goals:  - Get Haircut (PRIORITY)  - Stop eating/drinking/ingesting e-numbers - Detox diet!!!  - Learn a martial art... maybe Kendo...  - Learn to play that accursed drum  - Start Training for the Norwich Centuary  - Stop promising lists of eight points when you can't remember the last one  - ummm....    Of these goals, I have achieved:    - None    I'll explain... My hair is now in a row of braids along the front, forming a kind of veil, so I can see, although it's disconcerting for other people to try and gauge my expression. I've dramatically cut down on the e-numbers I'm eating, I'm going to stop before the 6th form in September. Martial arts I haven't the time for, I'm going to focus my energy on more productive less violent activities, like writing. That accursed drum is hanging from my wall, I can't find a teacher. I have started training for the Norwich Centuary,  albeit with little enthusiasm or actual cycling -  Mostly, I've been training for eating lots of Pasta beforehand. Sadly, my foresight in promised lists is still a little skewed.    I recently read Bill Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything". I believe I have just found the first book I've ever read that should be compulsary material in schools. It's a brilliant book. Apparently, The number of possible combinations of human DNA are ten to the power of 3,480,000,000. That is, a one followed by three billion, four-hundred and eighty million zeroes. That's a hell of a lot of possible different human combinations,  and there are far more complex organisms out there.     Anyway, enough random facts.    I'll keep you posted on... stuff.

      I've just realised that I've not said or posted anything for a long time. It's not that I'm being antisocial, I've just been busy. I was making a map for Unreal tournament, that took nearly every free waking hour for a week, and so I focused all my energy on getting it done. DM-[ka--]-Necropolis is born! Sadly, it seems my map isn't being welcomed - partly due to an oversize music file that has to be downloaded simultaneously.  urlLink Atari Forum Thread on my map  Anyway, besides that I had 6th form induction, Girlfriend matters (cough), and other aspects of life to be attended to. Never mind, I'm free now. I've managed to set up a webcam, so add me to MSN for face-to-face chat! ¡La lucha continúa!

      It's so bloody hot at the moment. Curse british weather. I keep sticking to my keyboard. And my chair. Grrrr. To make it worse, it's not sunny-hot. It's oppressive-storm-thunderclouds brit-summer hot. Roll on Autumn! I've also finished all my books. Not just all the readable ones, but ALL of them!!!  The next book in the Robert Jordan series comes out in January, damn it all. Sigh. Can't wait for 6th form. Education time!
