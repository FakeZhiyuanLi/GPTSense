            Last summer, we went on a  " Last Day of Summer-Vacation "  trip to ZOOZ. Although   the day wuz kinda wet and muggy, we had tonza fun fishing, seeing all the animals, going on the TRAM, and most of all, paddle-boating! All in all, we had mad fun... unfortunately, though, school started the very next day....

        Well, my "Sweet 16" is finally over, and now I'm slowly inching up to adulthood ...........what could be more scary!!!      Anyway, I gotta say that the little b'day party we had for my mom 'n me wuz a whole lot've fun!  Since it was about 3 months ago, I can't  really  remember  all  that we did (getting old, remember?) but we did play soccer at the park and my team won! ...and the guyz played b-ball, while the adults sat around, ate, talked, took pics.... and wutever! I got a lot of presents (..... yeah! ...) but what really counted was that all my loved ones were around to celebrate the coming year along with me! (Awww!)  Anyway, I'll "sut ^" now so that you can view the pics.....
