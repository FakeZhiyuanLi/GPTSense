      Another day of raining.  It is getting quite depressing.  I don't remember the last time it was sunny.  It is going to be difficult to do the laundry since I hang dry my clothes out on the balcony.    The other day I was very upset.  I took the JR train to go to work and on the way I got a phone call from my boss that my first class was cancelled.  I didn't have a class until 8:30 that night.  I asked if I had any other class before then.  She said she would call me in 30 to 40 minutes to let me know.  I got to Nagoya station where I usually transfer.  So I stayed in the station to wait for her call just in case she wanted me to cover a different class right away.  She called me back saying that she wanted me to teach a class at 7:30.  So I decided to go home since it was a long time before then.  I got back to my station, Ozone station. I put my ticket into the machine to get out of the station, but it wouldn't accept it.  So I went to the window where the JR worker was, hoping he would help me out with this.  I expected to lose 480 Yen for sure which was the price of the ticket to go to work.  The man was very rude and not helpful at all.  I tried to explain my situation the best that I could with my limited Japanese and with body language.  He seem to understand, but wasn't impressed with me at all.  He told me because it has been almost 2 hours since I bought my ticket I had to pay for the cost from Nagoya station to Ozone which was 190 Yen.  I couldn't believe it and I didn't understand why!  Not only did I lose 480 Yen I had to dish out another 190 Yen.  Well, I didn't know how else to explain myself or how to talk back to him.  I gave him the 190 Yen and left.  Not only was he not helpful at all, he was extremely rude and mean.  I was so mad.   urlLink    Spring

      Thought I give this weblogging a chance.  Still not too sure how to edit and post pictures yet, but hopefully after a while I'll get the hang of it.    Worked out today at the gym.  Did some weights and jogging.  My Eczema around my eyes is better.  I hope it disappears by chance one day.  No work thank God!  Time to relax and enjoy the humid, rainy temperature which will last throughtout these couple of months.   urlLink    Sakura

      Well, my eczema hasn't flared up for over a week now and i'm beginning to see the wrinkles and the redness to go away around my eyes!   Hurray!   The GTL Herbal solution diet really has helped along with the skin-e-dip that i ordered.  On the website it suggests that Eczema is not a skin disorder but instead a intestinal or internal disorder.  I was told that in Japan they add lots of additives to their food.   I think my body is reacting to some of those additives, since i never had any kind of allergies or skin rash before.   I've experimented with some foods to see which affects me. So far I discovered a few foods, all dairy products, soysauce, mushroom, and the sugar here.   Yeah, great to be allergic to Soy sauce in japan!  So basically my range of food is quite limited which totally sucks, but if it doesn't cause my eczema to flare up its all good with me!   Eczema is like hell, if one should ever experience hell.  So now I eat lots of vegetable and fruits which is good for me, but I sure miss cookies, crackers, candy, milk, and other delicious sinful food!  I'm hoping I've finally won this battle of discomfort!   urlLink    Bride
