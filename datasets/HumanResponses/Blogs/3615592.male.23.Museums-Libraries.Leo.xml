      Ok, gang....I need a little help. I just moved into the office--it's been painted and recarpeted and moved around a little, which is wonderful!  However, it's still quite...BORING. Here's where you come in! I want to use you for my personal benefit,  so listen up!  I would love to plaster my walls with you guys, and since I would get in trouble if I glued you all personally to the wall, I've got another idea: I'll decorate with stuff you've created! Do you draw or paint or sketch or take pictures or do other things that are along those lines? If so, I think it would be awesome if you drew or painted or sketched or took pictures or other things along those lines, something for the office! And what's better, for those of you who think you are incapable of being so artistic, draw me something anyway! Cat poop, or stick people, anything! So go for it! Also...if you have any other artistic and random office ideas, let me have them! Mark

      Ok everyone--I've given this a lot of thought, I've listened to all of you, I've talked to lots of others, and I've got a name idea for the youth group...just here me out! Actually, I borrowed this name from both Andrew Leblanc and Joel Lemon, who shared it on the blog a while ago, but I just recently got inspired about it... I Am!  Sounds weird at first, but it's good. It's great!   Olivet Wesleyan's "I Am" Youth Ministry! Here's the scoop-I got a sweet handout in a Bethany class entitled "I Am..." and lists like 30 Biblical traits of who we are in Christ. Examples: I Am...a child of God I Am...righteous and holy I Am...an enemy of the devil I Am...the light of the world I Am...the salt of the earth I Am...an ambassador of Christ I Am...a saint, saved by grace And it goes on and on and on, each one with Biblical references, of course. Pretty sweet, eh? So who are we as a youth ministry? We are....all of those things! Or we will strive to be those things! And here's another random idea: We paint the one side wall of the youth room (the one with BYG spraypainted all over it...the other walls all stay as they are; I think they're pretty sweet as they are) black, or a dark color. In the center of the wall, in white or a light color, we'll have a big, cool I AM logo, and then all of these I Am sayings painted all over the wall....it's who we are as a group. (I've a got a buddy who a graphic designer and I'm gonna see if he'll give us a cool logo type thing) Anywho....I think it sounds cool, what are your thoughts? Be honest, but give it some thought, ok?! Start posting! Pastor Mark

       Hey everyone!   Just some updates about our blog:      1) This is a place to build community, not to tear it down!   2) This is a place where teens in the youth group can write their thoughts and ideas, but all people are welcome to add posts, as well.   3) This is a place for pure talk and uplifting conversation--all demeaning posts and foul language are not welcome!   4) This is a place to have fun and be crazy!    5) This is a place, um, where...uh, well, this is a place!       Enjoy the blog, ok!       Pastor Mark
