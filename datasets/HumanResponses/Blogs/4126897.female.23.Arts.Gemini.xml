        A homeless man supplicates himself to Mecca in the shade of the Hwy 290 overpass as the sun calls to an end another working day, and all I can do is watch, finger on the shutter button. A brief pause in his prayers as he sees me.   I put my camera away.  Will this be the question of my art? What will I show to the world? And what will I keep, what of these subtle beauties, for my own eyes and memory alone? In an art where you reveal the world as is - what is made less sacred in the showing? and what is made more?  How am I supposed to decide that? Who am I to make that call?

        In the moments after...   You know people will think you're awful strange now, right?   yeah, well, it's always bound to happen sooner or later   True enough.   imagine the looks if they knew why I know this kind of crap.   So then what brought on this bit of spiritual observation?   avoiding personal introspection, I guess.   Expound.   I want that. I want to fly like that. I want to soar.   You know you can. You just have to stop fucking around and start applying yourself.   yeah, yeah. I know. Keep the cliches, ok?   Well what am I supposed to say?   I don't know.   Is there something else?   .....   Well? You know you can't hide things from me forever.   it's just... I want to fly like that.   I know. You said that already.   No, you don't understand. I want to fly like that. I want to soar...   Uh-huh...   But I don't want to do it alone.

           Have you ever noticed how, everyday, at dawn and again at dusk, the blackbirds gather? Always in the same place. Always at the same times.     There is an Aramaic word seen often in the old texts of the Christian faith.     They seem to be talking to each other. Gathering the information of the day. Small groups flying from one tree to another, intermingling. You know, the old superstitions believe that these birds were messengers for the dead. That these birds carried a spirit's wish of words to you while you slept.      This word is 'Selah'.      And that was why they gathered at dawn and at dusk - to deliver and take back messages, between the living and the dead.      It means 'Pause, and consider'.     So maybe I was right. Maybe they are gathering to talk. Just not to each other.      Selah.

       [Type. Type. Type.] ... [Erase]      [Type. Type. TYPE.] ... "no" ... [Erase]      [TypitytypeTYPEtype] ... "FUCK" ... [Erase]           Writer's block, eh?     yeah.     So why bother trying to write something right now? Just put it aside.     because I feel like writing.     Obviously not.     don't start today, ok? I'm really not in the mood for your wiseass remarks.     Touchy, touchy.     I've got alot on my plate right now, ok? Just trying to let off a little steam.     But sitting here staring at the laptop, erasing everything you write is only making you more frustrated. Isn't that a little counter productive?     ... shut up.               There is something deeply fucked about writer's block in the modern era. Back when I was a teenager, when I was wearing black to look m  oody rather than now to look thin and was writing  Poems to Slit your Wrists to , there was always a very gratifying feeling to being able to rip a page of drivel out of my notebook, crumple it up and throw it across the room. [Ctrl + A] > [Del] just doesn't have the same effect.       That's the one thing you can count on - that an artist will always be more violently critical of their own work than anyone else will be. I think sometimes it's that way with writer's more than anyone. You can't really blame it on a cheap medium or poor lighting. If your work sucks, it's because at that moment when you wrote it, you sort of sucked as a writer. Pure and simple. How often have we seen the imagery of the writer scribbling away at their desk, or punching the keys of a typewriter feveriously, only to crumple the page and toss it across the room to an over-full garbage can? You had that back then, that physical representation of your frustration, with your work, with yourself.       The modern era had taken that from us and made our self-criticism passive-agressive. [Ctrl + A] > [Del] just doesn't have the punch to it that piles and piles of balls of paper do. It doesn't speak to us like it should, and it's a little more devastating (and difficult) trying to ball up your laptop and junk that into the garbage.            Feel better?     didn't I tell you to shut up?     Just asking...     no. not really. but I wrote something. it amused me for a moment.     Well, what more can you really ask for?     true enough. just a bit of amusement until the next wave of inspiration I guess.     Indeed.

       She sat in the car for just a moment, just long enough to wonder if this was the right thing to do, if she should back out. A moment's hesitation that bred commitment. She hates feeling afraid.       This could get ugly you know.     Yeah, I know, but I'm only here because I have hope that it won't.     But where did your hope get you when this all started? Right here... Walking into an IHOP... I just think you should be prepared for the worst.     .....     You know I'm right.     When the fuck did my mental voice become such a pessimist?     After the course of events that took place the last time you met him at an IHOP.     ..... Who asked you?        1:40. Plenty of time she felt to order her tomato juice, get it paid for and be ready to flee should the need arise. A strategic retreat is not the same as being afraid and it's always wise for a woman to be prepared.         And what are you going to do if he calls you on all the bullshit  you  caused?     I'll be an adult and own up to it. Set an example for him when I start pointing the finger in return.     uh... huh.      What? You don't think I will?     .....     You know I'm not that scared, weak teenager anymore. I'm not the same person I was.     Yes you are. At you're core you've never changed. Not one bit. Any thing that seems to be change is superficial.     What the fuck are you talking about?     You've learned patience - but you're still hot-headed. You've act confident - but you're still insecure. Nothing has changed.      ..... yes it has.     No. It hasn't. Now quit lying to yourself.      I'm not!      Yes you are. You are still the same girl who was psychologically overpowered by this guy. At your core, where it matters. What will make this encounter any different? What will keep him from dominating you again?     I don't bend to people any more. I'm stronger now.      No stronger than you were seven years ago. Trust me - I'm here - in your psyche. I know these things.     So what? Because it happened once, I'm doomed forever?!     Did I say that?     I can handle this, thank you.     I never said you couldn't.     But you just...     Think about it for a moment. Here comes the waitress.        She pulled the lemon wedge off the side of the glass and mulled it over in her head. Squeezing in the sour juice with the semi-sweet she checked her watch. 1:45. Still time. She'll need to have the check ready. Where did the waitress go, she wonders.        You know it's not normal to occasionally view your life like a third-perspective short story.     And what? Having active conversations with you is?     Touche... So did you think about it?     Yes, I thought about it. You know I did.     And...?     And what?     Well, have you figured it out yet? Or do you just like to let the idea dance around in your head for a while?     .... cunt.     Takes one to know one.     Alright. Truce? We have more pressing matters to deal with.     Truce then.     So if I haven't changed then that means one of two things: either I'm screwed right now and should just leave to avoid another round of bullshit, OR I can do this, and I could have avoided it before...      Bingo.     I was just ... desperate to be loved. I didn't love myself so I needed someone else to.     And how are you now?     Well, I can't say I love myself, but I'm definately not desperate enough to act foolish.        A rough and familiar voice cut through the diner, "Still smoking I see?"   1: 50. He's early. "Some things never change," she replied, not even looking up.           I can do this.     Yes, you can.

       Bright beams of afternoon sunlight tearing through the smokey hazy, the only thing keeping the coffee warm. The soft shuffle of well-worn sneakers as the waitress comes by, eyeing the empty place across the table. The chat behind keeps drawing me out of this table for two... for one.        I'm not here to meet some love interest, you prying cunt. I here to finally get some fucking closure with a guy I thought I loved once, but now I really just want to hit him so why don't you just save that bullshit sympathetic look for him when I'm done  but all that comes out is, "Yeah, a refill would be great. Thanks."      He is late, but he was always late. Generally about ten minutes - just enough to seem like he was passionately caught up in some project he was working on, some play or bit of music, but no so late as to make you think that he didn't put it on pause for you. He liked to hold it over your head. He always used to come in late talking about some scene he had finally worked out in whatever new play he was writing, or how he was on the phone with someone to play a gig somewhere. He won't be saying any of that today. It's been eight years just about. He doesn't even really want to see me. I know this - but he could never ignore his curiosity, ever wondering what scene of the play of his life will come together before him. That's why, even though he's late, I know he'll come.      2:09 pm. Right on time.       Damn I forgot how short you are. And scraggly. And scruffy. And kind of strung out looking.  "Hi, Jason."       [insert his greeting, attempt at small talk  How are you? So what have you been up to? Oh, yeah,  The Glass Onion  is getting produced again. Blah blah blah and with exaggerated hand gestures ]

       Tangled knee-deep in dirty sweat vomit tears...    Something else. Something other. Something unimaginable.      Rolling rumbling raging in your gut a tidal of regret remorse longing.      No release. No hello. No goodbye.   This is all we know.      This is all we see feel seduce out of life and living.       Something like a fingerprint memory picture.   Not even real. Not even mine. Not for you to keep.       Tempest of it all.

       Soft packs. You hate soft packs. Should have said something when the guy handed it to you. Should have paid attention. One saving grace to them though: Just when you think they're empty...        ... always one left.
