      The World is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page. ~St. Augustine   This is the way I feel. While so many of my friends are busy buying cars and trying to move out, I am juggling school and a dead end job to save up enough money to go overseas. At the end of 2003 I made a decision to spend 2005, the year after I finish high school, going on a holiday around the world.   I spent a few nights on the internet looking for a good ‘round the world’ flight package for me. Although the Star Alliance seemed to have some cheap deals, they didn’t cater for all of the places I wanted to go. Then I came across the One World 5 Continents offer. It is so good it’s a joke. On their web page they have a few sample itineraries for travelers, and they involve going to about 8 places for AUD$3300. Through some reading of the rules applicable to the ticket, I found that I could travel to 20 places in five continents of my choosing for the same price. Considering that nowadays it can cost AUD$2000 for a ticket to the United States, it’s incredible that for just over a grand more you can go to 19 other cities.   When I took my itinerary to the local Flight Centre, they were stunned by the amount of places I had written down. They mentioned to me several times that it was the largest trip that they had ever handled, and that my journey was a ‘travel agent’s dream’. They also gave me loads of good advice on traveling safe and healthy in third world places.   As I am only 17, and unsure of whether my family (who are very supportive) will help me out financially on this trip, I concluded that it was time to get a good job and start putting in long hours.   I applied to a furniture factory who was offering jobs in the newspaper. After a quick interview, I was part of the team. Not counting the sawdust that causes cancer, the time a wheel broke and a 2m high trolley came crashing down on me, several other health and safety violations and an hourly wage of AUD$8.65, I enjoy the job because they give me hours when I need them and the people there are nice.   The main way I save money is by trying not to go out on Friday and Saturday night much. I only go to parties when they are important and I know who will be there, and when I don’t have to spend money on transportation. Before I had to save money, I used to go to any parties just to fill up my weekend because I had more fun going out than staying at home. I made myself stop doing this and now I actually rarely go to parties unless they one of my close friends is holding one.   As I still live with my parents, I find that many weeks I will spend absolutely nothing and the money will go straight into the bank untouched. I actually lost my wallet a while ago and I think it helped me save about AUD$300 because I couldn’t touch my money until another bankcard came.   The reality is, if I can save for a trip like this, than any other kid that doesn’t have any living expenses could do it also. Going on holidays for about 300 days and seeing a large quantity of the world in that time may seem reserved only for the ultra-rich, but it is actually is an obtainable goal if you are willing to put in the hard hours for it. Right now, I have AUD$1500 in the bank, all of which I have saved this year, and when school finishes I will be making AUD$400 a week. I figure that I will be able to save up at least AUD$5000 dollars this year and then earn more money in L.A., because my grandfather owns a furniture factory which I can work in.

      About 2 months ago there was a price war between Virgin Blue and the new Jet Star Airlines. As a result there were $30 tickets from the Gold Coast to several large cities around Australia. When the prices were read on the radio, I immediately called up my friend Toby, a German exchange student from Munich. He was interested in going to Melbourne and said he would definitely come with me, so we booked two round trip Jet Star tickets to Melbourne leaving the Gold Coast on Friday morning and returning on Sunday afternoon. I thought that it would be a great way to practice traveling alone for my trip around the world next year.   As our departure time came nearer, we realised that it would only be the airlines fourth day in service when we flew. As soon as it opened, news reports circulated that it was already notorious for taking away seats from people if they arrived later than 30 minutes before departure. For that reason Toby and I decided to arrive at the airport one hour before it left so as to be safe.   When we checked in the lady at the desk said that the departure had been moved 2 hours ahead to 12:45pm. We weren't too happy with that but we still decided to stay in the airport and just have something to eat before we left. When 12:45 came, however, the employees at the gate seemed to be confused. Some sort of bad communication had resulted and staff had to run out to the pilot of the plane to ask which flight number they were taking. However, this could also have had something to do with the fact that the Jet Star planes were completely white and no markings of any kind were present on them. When the staff finally made their decision, it was that the people who were booked for the airplane due in after us should have the plane, and that we who were supposed to leave at 10:45 should wait another hour for a different plane that is being serviced for some 'engine troubles'. We were quite tired of waiting in the airport at this time and both made the promise to pick Virgin Blue next time the tickets are on sale.   The flight finally came at quarter to 2 and we arrived in Melbourne at about 4:00pm. Luckily, the bus to our hostel was easy enough to work out and we checked into our youth hostel, Melbourne International Backpackers, before 5. MIB is located on Elizabeth St. right in the centre of the city. From the outside it looks a bit like a prison with long thin windows and an impenetrable style of architecture. On the way up to our room it still looked fairly cellblock like, but the colour scheme was more that of an insane asylum. It was only $20 dollars a night with breakfast, however, so I think that we were lucky we even got beds.   When we walked into our room our roommates Gary and Steve greeted us, they were two British guys traveling Australia. They were nice people so we put our stuff down on our beds and decided to go and check out the city. We walked aimlessly for a while until we saw Flinders Street Station, a huge clock tower which I immediately recognized from the back of the Lonely Planet Melbourne which I was reading in the bookstore during our long wait at the airport. We walked closer and found ourselves on the edge of the Yarra, the brown, leafy river that runs directly through the centre of Melbourne. It looked awesome at nighttime, with the European architecture of Flinders Street Station, the seemingly endless rows of lights from high-class restaurants looking out on the river and the overpowering Crown Tower Casino standing just behind. Wait, is that the Crown Tower Casino?? The most famous casino in Australia? It gets advertised where I live even though I am over 1000km away from it. Toby and I immediately made our way over there.   Unfortunately Toby and I aren’t 18 (I will be when I go around the world). We did manage to get some half decent fake ID’s before we came though. When we walked into the casino we were immediately stopped for id. We both pulled them out but we were told that we needed to show our passports to get in. At first I was a little bit disappointed but maybe it was a good thing as I probably could have easily spent my budget there. We decided just to have dinner at Sushi Train and then go back to the hostel to see what Gary and Steve were doing.   When we got back our roommates invited us to come with them to a place called the Arthouse, a Melbourne nightclub. They said that they knew a girl who knew a guy who played in a band that was playing at the Arthouse, so maybe we could get free entry or something. They also mentioned that the music might be ‘a little heavy’. Toby and I decided to go along and give our ID’s another chance. As we approached the Arthouse I realised that ‘a little heavy’ was an understatement. Toby and I weren’t asked for ID, but were charged $7.00 for entry, so much for the ‘connection’ to the band. The music was absolutely crap. Completely unintelligible screaming and too distorted guitar over a drummer who was off beat constantly basically sums it up. The singer (or screamer) sounded so bad that Toby said to me “I hope he is feeling better in the morning.”   Toby and I played some pool with Gary and Steve who were thankfully not enjoying the band either. We left after about 30 minutes and asked the bouncer on the way out where a good nightclub was that played popular style music. He suggested that we go to The Spa Lounge, a nightclub on the other side of the city. He also said to tell them that ‘John’ sent us to get free entry. We walked the 2 ½ kilometres to The Spa Lounge and we could tell that it was looking a lot better. My ID worked and even though I swear they had no idea who ‘John’ was we got free entry. Toby and I both had a couple jugs of beer and were soon dancing on stage in front of everyone. The nightclub was excellent and full of people. We left at about 6:00am and made our way home after what turned out to be a great night. We woke up later that morning at about 9:00am to get breakfast. Both of us were really tired but we still wanted to go to St. Kilda by tram that morning.   Gary and Steve advised us that no one buys tickets for the tram and the police never come on board, but the staff at MIB told us that they frequently get reports of backpackers getting $100 fines and that we should buy a day pass. We decided in the end to buy a day pass for $3.00 even though we did feel a little bit stupid putting money into the ticket machine when it became apparent that absolutely no one else was.   We arrived in St. Kilda after a half hour tram ride and walked around. The style of shops there reminds me a lot of Byron Bay and I enjoyed it a lot. Toby and I also had a look at Luna Park which I think we both agree is one of the worst theme parks ever. Thank god it has free entry, otherwise I would have wanted my money back.   We were a little bit bored so we decided to catch the tram to Federation Square, a new large outdoor area with art museums and cafes. On the way there we looked out our window and instantly spotted the restaurant Seven Stone from the popular TV show, ‘My Restaurant Rules’. The final was on that night (unfortunately Seven Stone was eliminated), so we thought we would get off the tram and take a look. The queue outside was huge and the menu was extremely overpriced so we decided to give eating there a miss. It seemed that Seven Stone was trying to keep their restaurant a secret or something by covering all their windows with black paper and not allowing any clear views to the inside. Toby and I walked around the back of the restaurant to see if there was any way to see in. There wasn’t. There was, however, a hallway for staff to enter through. Toby and I walked straight in and stood at the back door of the restaurant. Waiters who I recognized from the TV show ran back and forth in front of us. They gave us strange looks but I think they were too busy to deal with what we were doing. Camera crews were walking back and forth inside filming the people and it was pretty interesting to watch.   After we were finished watching that we got back on the tram and continued on to Federation Square. It was pretty fun and we had lunch at the restaurant there. We then figured that it was time to get some sleep if we were going to go out that night so we headed back to the hostel and slept until 7:00pm.   We woke up and decided to go to a place called the Dallas Bar which we had seen the night before. They had $1 beers and $2.50 basic spirits so we decided to start our night there. At about midnight, we decided to go to the Metro, known as the largest nightclub in the southern hemisphere. It was giant. There was a great RnB room that had a celing that was at least 50 feet high and spaceship shaped pods on the walls with dj’s and lighting people inside controlling the dance floor. The best thing, however, was the cover band Tarko playing upstairs. They were awesome. Toby and I watched them until 2:00am and then went down to the dance floor until about 4:00am. My ID worked fine all night. We then went back to MIB.   We woke up the next morning about 10:00am and went to Queen Street Mall. It is a marketplace with a collection of small stalls selling various pieces of boring junk. We ate food there and then went back to our hostel because it was free pool on that day. After a couple hours there, Toby and I said goodbye to Gary and Steve and caught a bus back to the airport. We departed on time and arrived back home later that night.

      I have started to train for my trek to Machu Picchu in March next year. All the information I have read states that if you are reasonably fit the 4 day hike can be done without too much difficulty, but I feel like I should prepare a bit especially because of the high altitude that I will be climbing in. I have never been good in high elevations and a few times I actually fainted while on trips with my family to the Rocky Mountains in the USA.  On Sunday I climbed Mount Warning, which is about an hours drive from my house. Mount Warning is an ancient inactive volcano and is also the highest mountain within reasonable distance of my house. My friend Lucas and I started the 8.8km climb (all uphill) at about noon and for the first hour or so it was good fun. The scenery was very tropical and there was a lot of wildlife to be seen. After the first hour, however, it began to get really hard. The trail started out at only a small incline but slowly got steeper and less maintained. When we reached the halfway point I was in a complete sweat but happily surprised that it was a strenuous climb and not something easy.  The trail was almost completely encased in foliage, but it slowly became noticeable through the thinning air and decreasing temperature that we were getting really high up. At one point the foliage opened up to a huge view down the coast of New South Wales and this gave us both a huge burst of energy to finish the climb.  About fifteen minutes later we rounded a corner and a sign reading “The Final Assault” confirmed that we were very near the end. Unfortunately, the last 200m of the climb were by far the hardest. The trail changed suddenly into an extremely steep rock scramble complete with a chain-linked handrail to help us pull ourselves up. This would have been fun in normal conditions, but with my already weary legs and a vaguely familiar feeling of altitude sickness affecting my climbing, it turned into a battle between my mind and body as I forced my legs to climb each step.  Finally, we reached the top. It felt great to finally stand still and absorb the view. A huge amount of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales can be seen from up their and we spent a good 45 minutes up there eating our lunch and looking at the sights.  Coming down seemed to take forever, but it was easier and soon after we were back at the car. My legs were sore for a good two days and I am very glad I went. I think that it is a good mountain for training and hope to be able to climb it about once every 2-3 weeks until I leave for my trip.

      I am coming to the end of my 2-week winter vacation and, believe it or not, it is a relief. For me it has been anything but vacation. Working 2:30PM to 10:30PM Monday to Friday is quite stressful and despite having the weekends and mornings off to do what I want, I seem to spend all of my time sleeping or working on my website.  It's a bit different for me to spend so much time at home without seeing my friends. I know that I am missing out on doing fun things but I also know that fun things cost money and I need every penny for next year.  Actually, as I look more into it, the trip is going to cost a lot more than I previously thought. I bought my $3300 dollar ticket earlier this week and got taxed $875. That combined with immunization costs, insurance, a two-month EuRail Pass, YHA Membership, visas and more leaves me almost broke before I even leave home. Don't get me wrong, I am not thinking even in the slightest about changing my plans, I just know that my year away is going to be more of a struggle than expected. Hey, look on the bright side; my blog is probably going to be much more entertaining for you guys to read! Who wants a story about a rich traveler who is sheltered in fancy hotels and restaurants the whole time and doesn't ever get to see the true colours of the places he is visiting?  As I look over my itinerary, I think more and more about how lucky I am to have the contacts I do around the world. My friends who were exchange students at my school are all great, interesting people and making friends with them has broadened my horizons, as I now know that even thousands of miles from home I have people who know me and can help me.  Felipe and Will, two Brazilian exchange students from my school, left for home a few days ago. I had known them since they arrived and decided to go see them off at the airport. The only problem was their flight left at 6.00 in the morning. I set my alarm and woke up at a quarter to 5. I wanted to go back to sleep so bad and I was sure that they would have plenty of other friends there to see them off, but I forced myself to go anyway. I drove down to the airport and met with them at their terminal. It turned out that I was the only local to see them off. As we exchanged details, Felipe pulled out a Brazilian soccer jersey and gave it to me. We said our goodbyes and I was so glad that I came. Not only did I get a great souvenir, I also made two lifelong friends with whom it might have been harder to stay in touch had I just gone back to sleep.   Tobi, Juan-Carlos and Luis are other good friends who I have had to say goodbye to recently. Although it is sad to part ways with them, it feels great to have the knowledge that I am going to see them next year and this time I can meet them on their own turf.
