      i'm exhausted. was up way too late last night. nevermind what i was doing. al knows my dork tv downloading. haaaaaa. and work was extra long today. tired tired tired.  but one more day of work and then le weekend! anyone want to go to craig's party in hoboken friday? it's his birthday and i'm going to need an excuse to leave. he called me and asked me to come and i really only said yes cause they're getting a keg of the guinness and ohhhhh i love the guinness. *note* (when we dated he never drank guinness but he's apparently drinking it now to remind himself of what he wishes he still could have) (and by that i mean me. or not. soooooo yeah.) but oh i'm happy those days are over. so i will probably go like a good friend and give him my shin tickets i can no longer use because he likes them more than me and we will chat and hug and high five and laugh and wonder why we're not still together. but then i'll realize i like the beer more than him and excuse myself and wish him a happy birthday.  and then make my way out onto park avenue cold and lonely and randomly meet some boy on the street who needs something (and that something will be a lighter or directions or me) and we'll talk and talk and talk and fall in love right outside of his apartment. cause those things happen to me all the time. and i'm being serious. i have the weirdest things happen to me when i'm out and about by my lonesome.   so someone please come with me so all that doesn't happen and maybe i can have a normal friday night.  happy cinco de mayo y'all!!!!!!!

      ... backwards i can bend.  i understand you.  and you understand me ...  rainy icky saturday!  so much to say as well!   urlLink on the speakers  were much better than i had thought they would be.  some good stuff there forrrrreal.  the singer has an amazing voice and their show r o c k e d.  hung out at pianos for a bit and ran into my ex boy randomly on the way out.  we have been talking a bit lately and i'm glad we can still be friends.     got an email this morning from my dear friend ohad.  he wrote me to tell me his  urlLink band's  disc will be released on virgin/emi australia...  yay for him!!! they're opening up for gomez too in july!  i'm so happy for him :)  i'm off to dave's housewarming party soon.  it's so strange i've known him for over ten years!  we just got back into  contact  last fall because he's a patient at our office.  haaaa dumb optometry pun.  do you see?  haaaaa *eye* see.  soooooo yeah.  i've seen him randomly over the past few months here and there at random spots.  last friday i ran into him and he gave me the invite so off i'm about to go!  this morning i found a bunch of cd's in a box while cleaning that i thought i had lost and were gone forever!  i haven't seen these since i moved back from boston!  one of them was radiohead's kid a.  when it came out i bought the limited edition  urlLink book/cd .  so yay for me finding it again!  here are the words that are written inside.  it may be in the actual cd booklet too but i don't have it.  *** nobody likes nothing i certainly wish with all my heart that it did not exist but wishing is not enough we live in the real world where nothing does exist we cannot just disinvent it nothing is not comprehensible neither you nor i have any hope of understanding just what it is and what it does it is hard to know if nothing is actually nothing and thus difficult to know if a policy of doing nothing is successful nothing however effective it may have proved up to the present can hardly continue to do so indefinitely if i had to choose between the continued possibility of nothing happening and of doing nothing i would unquestionably choose the latter or the former  oh i do love thom yorke's words.  in 1997 i printed on photo paper all of his writings from the ok computer era site and made a collage of all of them on my wall.  i would lie on my bed (cause that's what you do when you're 17)  and read them over and over and over... yeah.  some were even from the pyramid song.  yahoooo.  ahhhh radiohead.  what a lovely band.

      lovvvvvvvvvvvve faultline.  mr coldplay actually makes me feel again.  love that i have every friday off.  love that jim will be back.  going to dave's housewarming party tomorrow.  i have yet to get his gift.  him and his two guy roomates are registered at crate and barrell.  haaaaa three guys with a c&b registry.  i think i've decided on the butter warmer haaaaaaaaa.  sunday is great bamboozle in crappy asbury park.  i'm ashamed of myself for going there again.  but metric was more than worth it when i went.  and i'm sure all 5675976 bands sunday will be too.  sooooo yeah.  i got my hair cut this week.  i worked three days in a row because of memorial day.  i had a lovely holiday.  may go see on the speakers at  urlLink mercury lounge  tonight.  as plans have now changed from what they were.  butternutsquash is lying upside down like an otter.  june is meeting me for lunch today.  she won $60000 in the lottery last year.  i've won $5000 this year.  we are two lucky girls.  (she's obviously luckier).    word.  off to s h o    w   e            r.

      oh dear lord do i have the most talented fabulous friends who are the bestest musicians EVER!!!  i'm listening to michael's new tracks and oh my Fing goodness.  it's like i'm listening to a sad movie when i hear his songs.  they break my heart and i never want them to be over.  i miss him.  i do.  he reminds me of boston.  we left.  i left.  he left.  i don't know who went first though.  i do remember leaving though...  what a great choice that was at the time.  (and still is, it is).  even though i left for reasons that had nothing to do with him. love was certainly in the air. but we never found out what could've happened.  we couldn't cause *i* couldn't.  i was distracted by/with someone else.    everyone is exactly who they are.  you know i've learned in my wee twenty four years and some that people do not change.  well they  rarely  do.  but what do i know?  yeah they change location and people and love but deep down inside they're the same.  but are they?  we're so ever-changing *with* people but we are always the same.  i've changed in many ways but i'm still pretty much me.  i've learned to not take things so seriously.  i've learned to do what i say i'm going to do.  i've learned that it means something to do that.  to do what you say you're going to.  i've learned that i have more friends that i actually would rather not consider friends.  or could consider friends.  and yeah we're all human and we make mistakes and let each other make mistakes and still love and support each other for each and every one of them... or do we?  isn't that the point? blahhhhhhhhhhhh.  last friday nights "situation" has made me start thinking about this way too much.  i just don't like to fight with my friends.

      ... but no way to feed it ...  short strike.  thanks D.  :)  going to bed.  i work at both offices tomorrow.  three i&r's.  (that's insertion and removal for those of you not in the know of optometry language.  and that's contact lenses insertion and removal thank you.  hey c'mon we're all good kids here.  guess how many jokes i get about what i do?).  then thursday only one office.  and then le weekend!  we'll be officially celebrating jim's arrival, at  urlLink pianos  friday night.  bring your mates.  drinks on me.  you heard me.  not going to nxne as i have in the past.  oh well.  if you are playing it again, like some liars are, you're probably not doing that great as a musician.  yeah that's a low blow.  but only to one someone in particular.  although i do love toronto.  going there at the end of july.  i miss my friends there.  i miss so many things.  it's nice to miss.  it's nice to hear someone say they miss you.    and i will miss ben.  he told me today he's moving back to boston.  his job is not working out and away he'll be leaving.  it's sad to think that he won't be a half hour away.  it's sad that we didn't go that distance together.  he was there the most important day of my life.  he was my best friend.  and i doubt we'll keep in touch.  we broke up last summer and i saw him for the first time after that this past christmas.  he brought up getting back together.  i didn't have the heart to tell him that i never would and that i was also seeing someone.  and of course i didn't lie, i just didn't say anything.  and then we didn't talk much... so it never came up again.  he had brought me a gift and i had brought back a bunch of his stuff that i had had.  and my heart broke all over again that day.  and that's how i feel now knowing that he'll be leaving.  it just makes me sad.  even though he'll only be four hours away... but we won't visit each other.  cause that's how things like that go.  and that's that.  i will just miss him so much when he leaves.

      going to bed soon.  been editing my book for the past few hours while reading middle stories by  urlLink sheila heti  again.  i strangely love this book.  i noticed on amazon that it was released  urlLink again ???  i have the old edition with handglued photograph on the cover and the uneven pages.  that is how my book will be.  uneven and possibly missing pages (missing probably in only certain people's copies).  my book will be imperfect.  the grammar will be incorrect at times and full of runon sentences.  captilization left out.   hypens missing.  it will break copywright laws and i will quote people without their approval.  but it will be something i am proud of.  and for everyone that i love.  some slean for you to rest your eyes with... goodnight.  madeliene shall her story end? with this aftermath music my broken french?  heal her if you can pray the lions aren’t waiting take her hand i want to be brave i want to be brave but the night goes up in flames the courage we need a  fury to tame  this madness, madness, madness  no more will i count the dead bending gathering words i should have said when night falls it scrapes its knees we watch the houses on fire and she says to me i want to be brave i want to be brave  but i don’t think i’ll love again  the dark is so deep i’ve lost my way in this madness, madness, madness  over time luck runs out and fate is not your friend over time good must go and are we safe yet?  madeliene can i escape again? out of a dragonfly jar am i safe yet?

      wow.  i've been listening to all the old cd's i found and i just popped in one of me singing boy songs from when i was 20!!!  funniest ever.  i had sent it to my friend eric in simi valley ca as a joke.  he said i only listened to sad weepy songs (which at the time i did :/) and if i ever wrote songs they would be all be slow and sad and wussy.  so i picked a bunch of songs by boys that we loved at the time and made them slow and sad and wussy!  my friend tony recorded them on my very first mindisc recorder!   we had fun that day laughing and making songs that rock... not rock.  and then we jumped off a bridge haaaaaaaaaaa.  these were the songs:  stereophonics - roll up and shine oasis - talk tonight travis - writing to reach you richard ashcroft - song for the lovers joseph arthur - in the sun ocean colour scene - circle  actually a couple of those were already sad and wussy soooo yeah.  yeahhhhhhh.  lame stuff over here at 11pm.

      listening to live richard ashcroft.  where is he lately???  love love love his first solo disc.  the second one not so much.    the party last night was so much fun.  fun that i so needed.  there was bbq goodness, plenty of beer, and tequila.  the boys loved the butter warmer.  his roommates were wonderful and the party went on til the wee hours this morning.  yay!!!  skipped the great bamboozle today.  so i've been able to recover well and stay in all day!  played all morning, got some reading done, had a great nap, and now i'm going through some of my mindiscs and labelling them.  since i have about thirty that are unlabeled and not track marked.      ahhhh i love relaxing sundays.  this month is going to be superilyfun!  with jim getting here tuesday, then the party friday, seeing my bro this weekend,  urlLink franz ferdinand  at volume in lebrooklyn,  urlLink lori  at tonic, and my three day work weeks is certainly making a lovely june.  how come the  urlLink platinum  gamecube is back?  i want it!  hmmm tempted... anyone want a purple one?  making vodka sauce for dinner yumm!  :)  then erin's coming over to play and have some coffee and giggle about the party last night.  we just got back in touch recently.  she lives about three streets away from me and i've known her just about all my life.  she is so fun and such a sweetheart.  we saw each other randomly a few years ago in cambridge mass at an atm.  it's strange the people you run into.  and the people who exit and then re-enter your life.  she is one who i am glad re-entered.  although she didn't exit like some people in my life have.  as in the bad exit way.  there are a few of them.  and i am glad they're gone.  others i miss dearly and think of ways to somehow bring them back.

      at work now.  and it's friday ick!  had a lovely day off yesterday.  met up with the friend i saw on sunday to take a walk in an arboretum.  then we bought a bunch of candy and sat around in a park.  it started raining so we ended up in a cafe and talked and talked and talked... went to erin's late last night and then fell happily asleep.    i love this summer so far.  well it actually starts this monday but it feels like it already... yay!  and i'm not a summer person!    i'm thinking of getting a little kitty for my big kitty.  i'm thinking i want to go up to boston soon.  i'm thinking of falling in love.  i'm thinking of doing more of nothing.   la la la la.

      hooked my computer back up after being....... unhooked.  had a wonderful weekend (and it's still going!!!)  friday was fun in brooklyn, last night was a relaxing iamnotgoingtodoagoddarnthing saturday night.  today was fun in the park, laundry and my brother and his girlfriend leaving after their short visit.  sooooo yeah.  not too much else going on... although i hit a bluejay last weekend.  i can finally discuss it now.  that's how fast and crazy i drive.  i can hit birds.  i was at work sitting outside last friday and noticed a blueish mess coming out from the front of car... and then i remembered.  i was driving down my street the day before and saw a bird hovering over something icky in the road and i swerved to miss it and heard  something   but when i looked back in my rearview i didn't see the bird.  so i assumed it flew away.  cause birds have wings.  but no :(  i hit it and it was hanging in the undercarriage of my car.  boooooo.  but it's out now and in a baggie somewhere.  fourth of julyyy is coming up yahoooooooo!  but i don't know what exactly i'll be doing.    and let's see... i'm off to start dinner and be silly.  may see erin tonight.  and there is a boy who likes me and i am afraid.

        the more i listen to muse the more i'm in love with them.&nbsp; we love muse at work.&nbsp; yay for them coming here soon.&nbsp; my eyes are going swirly from contact lenses and glasses frames.&nbsp; i'm leaving in a half hour though so yay!    does anyone know how to post links on your blog?&nbsp; not in the posts but&nbsp;ON&nbsp;the blog... ???&nbsp;     okie so i lied.&nbsp; only one more post today.&nbsp; maybe one later tonight depending on what goes on.&nbsp; my night will include kalen, kristen,&nbsp;guinness, printing pictures, my kitty, and laughing.&nbsp; i like low-key nights.&nbsp;     when i worked at the cafe in boston there was this french guy called joel.&nbsp; joel liked me and asked me out one day.&nbsp; i politely said no (you ain't it) but we stayed friends.&nbsp; he was nice enough and he had a lovely french accent.&nbsp; one day he gave me this french poem book and i almost fell over because i was so excited to read poems en francais.&nbsp; i was made fun of by all of my friends and my face would turn red when he would come in.&nbsp; he would lean over the counter and whisper things in french to me.&nbsp; i would try to translate quickly because i love the french language.&nbsp; not so much that i was interested in what he had to say.&nbsp; so joel kept asking me out like the&nbsp;joel he was.&nbsp; and one day i said yes.&nbsp; i don't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp;as i said he was nice enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;i couldn't imagine kissing him but i&nbsp;could imagine walking through a park&nbsp;together.&nbsp; so we planned to meet at the cafe and go to a film at the cinema and then drink some cafe au laits.&nbsp; i got there late (as usual) the night that we planned to go out like adults.&nbsp; i waited and waited.&nbsp; but le joel never showed up.&nbsp; he came in the next morning with flowers and said he was sorry and that there was no excuse for him (he actually said that in his french accent "there is no excuse for me" which became of course the most used line with my friends and i - most used is that proper grammar?) so we planned to go out the next night.&nbsp; same plan, same time, same situation.&nbsp; there was no excuse for joel.&nbsp; he stood me up AGAIN.&nbsp; next morning he came in and apologized again and he asked me out for the next night and i had to say no to joel.    if that wasn't random enough this is how some people spell my name: kimy (one m?) and&nbsp;kimberley (extra e?).&nbsp; thought you'd all like to know.&nbsp;     au revoir!

       huh.&nbsp; blogger did something new with their composing posts screen thing and i don't like it!  &nbsp;  sooo yeah.&nbsp; just got home from the city after dropping patty off and after seeing joseph again!&nbsp; yay yay yay&nbsp;for both.&nbsp;&nbsp; my brother came too and&nbsp;the show&nbsp;was amazing.&nbsp; he is one of the most talented musicians i've ever seen.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  now i'm listening to slean because i'm just&nbsp;in that slean mood.&nbsp; her song eliot is&nbsp;absolutely perfect.&nbsp; it is the perfect song.&nbsp; everything about it&nbsp;hurts my little heart.&nbsp; it's not even the saddest* of her songs.&nbsp;&nbsp;but it makes me ultrasad every time i hear it:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  armies and ice and dirty green.&nbsp; newspapers, shovels, sand on the breeze.&nbsp; i think of eliot when&nbsp;i smell the street.&nbsp; and it’s sometimes wise just to shut your eyes.&nbsp; workers and lovers make their living space neat.&nbsp; bent out of shape over what to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;i dream of eliot but&nbsp;i am discrete.&nbsp; cause it's sometimes wise just to shut your eyes.&nbsp; how sure, how right, can anyone be on sight?&nbsp;&nbsp;i said&nbsp;i had hope.&nbsp; i&nbsp;lied.&nbsp; the city in winter, the sewage, the steam.&nbsp; you fill buildings with people and they rip at the seams.&nbsp; and somebody’s suffering infected my dreams.&nbsp; and don’t they know it’s just my old soul?&nbsp; how sure, how right, can anyone be on sight?&nbsp; i&nbsp;said&nbsp;i had hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;i lied.&nbsp; so calm.&nbsp;&nbsp; so wise.&nbsp; give him the nobel prize.&nbsp; he said he had hope.&nbsp; he lied.  &nbsp;  i said i had hope.&nbsp; love love love that.&nbsp; i love her music so much i can't stand it.&nbsp; joseph is up there with her (and of course&nbsp;tori always) but there's&nbsp;something about sarah that&nbsp;absolutely kills me.&nbsp; she&nbsp;reminds me of the hopeless romantic, the foolish girl in love, and&nbsp;the girl who never learns that i am.&nbsp;

      metric leaves that part out now when they play dead disco live booooooooooo.  emily just dances and talks.   going to see the cure soon with my brother.  we're going to go downtown first and get some thai!  word.  i wasn't that excited to go but as it comes closer i am!  yay muse!  mmmmm.  last night was lovely and low key.  once i got over the brooklyn bridge, it took me one hour and twenty minutes to get to and through the holland tunnell.  and then another forty minutes to drive home.  my eyes were closed most of the way home!  :O  no i'm serious.  ACK.  bad bad bad.  i secretly like phantom planet.  he almost has a lovely voice whatever his name is.  isn't it funny that when you love a band so much you know the singer's name.  haaaaaa.  what's their name matter or what they're like?  i could care less about musician's personal lives.  i like what they do.  and that's that!  okie i'm just wasting time until we leave.  dead disco!  dead funk!  dead rock and roll... remodel!

      i just bought a new  urlLink camera .  my old little cybershot died today.  it's actually still half alive.  when i press the on button, it tries to work, it tries so hard and it makes the saddest little noises but nothing happens and then it won't open.  the front is crushed.  au revoir! so it has just been replaced!  yahoooooooo!  it's the same type of camera, i just wanted one that i could use my oodles of memory sticks in.  sooooo yeah.   i've been telling everyone to take advantage of amazon's spend $250, get $50 back so yay now i am!  there is a place in "your account" where you can review your order history.  mine goes back to 1998!  holy crap i was a shopping internerd back then too!  but my first order was not me!  i bought a buffy guide for my brother.  you know buffy the vampire slayer - the show?  ring a bell anyone haaaa?  :O  i've also bought numerous books i've adored, books from when i was in school in boston, and numerous little gadgets!  so yay!  now that i think about it, amazon should've just given me the camera.  that's what i think.  i've been faithful.  dedicated.  i talk about them to my friends.  we connect.  they understand me!  but they still make me pay!  but oh well.  money is nothing.  it's paper and time and fun things.   so go spend some money at amazon before august 1st and then you can spend more later.  voila!  this is what happens when kimberly has too much time on her little hands.  oh my.

      ... we were like moviestars.  it was all pretend.  doomed from the start.  and you broke my heart later in the scene by the car.  i was a movie.  i was a tragedy.  it was a work of art ...  * * * I will keep contacting you until you tell me to stop, but this will be the last in my series of desperate to communicate my feelings for you .  I'm not kidding when I say that I love you and you are always on my mind. Although the dynamic of our relationship has changed I still feel the same way about you and I want you to know that. Our lives are still just beginning and we will see and do many things, but you will always be in my heart. Two other things that I have to tell you about: 1. I wrote another song about you ( you may be the person who has the most collective art and literature created with you as their muse than anyone in this planet). 2.My Temp job brought me to the most unlikely of place * * * that's the email he wrote me on thursday.  he called me tonight and i missed the call.  i just called him back and we talked for maybe ten minutes.  what can i even say?  and what did i say?  just now on the phone.  i asked him how his move was.  he asked me the usual things that people ask me.  we talked about his email for a brief moment.  i never said he was kidding when he told me he still loved me.  we didn't talk about why i haven't contacted him since may.   he told me that his new temp job is right by my old apartment.  and when he arrived for his first day of work it was in the same place where we had been the last time we were in boston together to visit.   we lived in boston at the same time but didn't know each other.  we met a couple years later at a show in jersey, we had the best love in the universe, and then we went our separate ways.  he told me the song he wrote about me was about blame.  and how he blames himself still.  blame.  what a strange word.  that's in my favourite line in slean's  urlLink universe :   i don't blame you, i never have .  i don't blame people.  people can't be sorry... it's not an accident, it's a choice.  but i don't blame him.  it's strange talking to someone you used to be in love with.  is there a little button inside of us that can be easily be switched on and off?  not the love button.  the button that allows us to leave someone.  i have been left.  i have left.  and except for a few certain people i still can't understand why.   i'm talking about someone who you are so in love with.  and i know things change.  and you need to make decisions.  it's a constant circle and cycle.  you get in a relationship, you hope for the best, you try, they try, you "see how it goes", and then what... it works, it doesn't.  and then you're still friends or you don't speak.  i don't get it.  how can people treat people like this?  it's just being careless.  and that's sad.  or selfish.  and that's worse.  i don't want to be careless with someone, with their feelings.  blah.   he left me and my heart broken.  but a year later i can't even feel it.  because he has really left me.  he is rarely in my thoughts.    i am happy to know he is trying to make himself happy.  and i wish him all the luck with his job and music and life.  but that's it.  i'm not going to help him help himself feel better.  and i won't.  soooooooo yeah.  i'm listening to emily's solo version of succexy.  let's drink to the military.  i'm drinking a singha.  i'm remembering why things are what they are now.  i'm hoping to see my friends who make my life amazing this week.  i missed seeing my one friend this weekend and i want to see him now more than anything.  he makes me laugh and feel good every second i'm around him. e v e r y second.  it's slean time!  but i'll be back.

      ... you wait.  oh hold on i'm coming.  don't let anybody in.  oh good love i'm ready.  lock your doors and wait for me ...  i'm an incurable romantic.   i love love.   it's an illness that i have.  isn't love what life is about?  loving anything and everything we choose?  finding things to love in life?  when it comes to love, shouldn't people be the first thing you should love?  your parents, your friends, your relationships, your lovers... people have and always will be first to me.  and there are other things:  the things you do, the dreams you have, the goals you have, the job you work, the place you live... all other things you could love.  sometimes do.  but it always ties into the first love.  you want to share those things with someone you love.  (unless you really don't.  and you only love things that make you happy, not people.  or you're cynical and think you want to end up entirely by yourself.  then you probably won't get what i'm saying.  or i might be wrong.  you actually may want to just be by yourself.  so then i'm wrong with you.  but i'm usually not.  and i've taken polls.)  yet people put it off.  they push love to the side.  they say not now. or hide it.  why do those things?  why not be crazy?  why ever be cautious?  you only miss out with your eyes closed.  and if it doesn't turn out the way you wanted well then at least you tried.      at the end of the day isn't love what you want?  to love and to be loved?  you sure aren't thinking about your job!  or yikes maybe you are.  but i think someone is lying if they say don't want love.  people who say there are "more important things" to worry about.  and i say it sometimes.  but deep down i don't mean it.  i know i don't because love is amazing.  temporary love.  absolute love.  forever love.  whatever.  i want it all.  i've had it all.  i want it all again.  i'm sick without it.  and i'll be the only one who will ever admit it.  i'll be the only one who talks about it constantly.  it's so important and yet we treat it like it's not.  how are people surviving?    or could love not be that important?  because we're careless.  we don't think.  we don't try.  or maybe we just don't know.    i can't help it.  and i wish i could sometimes.  but i can never turn this off.  it's a constant thought and it never goes away.  i feel so strange right at this moment.  it just hit me.  it's not so much a longing feeling right now.  or a lonely feeling.  or is it?  i just have this slow swelling in my heart.  it's not hurt either.  i don't dwell.  it's slow and steady and just making me a little sad.
