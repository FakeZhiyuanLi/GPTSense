      My birthday is this Saturday (June 12th). I'll be 17...not that I'm really all that excited. I mean, what can you do when you're 17 that you can't do when you're 16? Not much of anything. But it looks like my birthday will be just as boring this year as it has been every year. People don't usually make a big deal about my birthday, and I don't ever have parties or anything like that. I guess, to me, birthdays aren't really that important. It just marks another year that I've been alive. Really, it's nothing to celebrate. This year, I was supposed to spend the day with Kevin, but he's got to stay in Virginia an extra day and he won't be back until Sunday. Yeah...I'm a little bummed. I mean, who wouldn't be? I'm really not sure what I'm going to do anymore. Plus, I miss him terribly. I think I'm just bummin' because I miss him bunches and it's been almost a week since the last time I saw him...but it still sucks that I won't be able to see him on Saturday. I don't want to be bummed out because I don't want him to feel badly about the fact that he won't be here. There's nothing he can do about it, and I know he wants to be here more than anything. *Sigh* I'm sure everything will be fine.  Something really good happened yesterday, though. Johnny, my ex-boyfriend that I had a relationship with for about a year and half, finally decided that it's time for us to take some time apart because he needs to sort out his feelings for me. He basically just told me that he can't see me anymore, but would like to keep our friendship because it means a lot to him. He said he'd call me when he feels that the time is right for us to see each other again. And I totally agree with him. He hasn't taken any time to himself yet, and I know he's needing it. I told him to find someone to talk to about this whole thing, and I know he's going to be OK. I figure that our friendship will be a lot healthier after he does this.

      Life is a whole lot better when you let things off your chest. The last few posts that I have graced the internet with have been nothing but crap. It's just that, sometimes, it really really helps to just be able to rant and let it all out and not have anyone to tell me to shut up. It makes me feel so much better when I can just get everything out in the open. Then I don't have to hide anything and it can all be dealt with and taken care of in its own way. I think that the last two posts that I made (before this one) helped me to feel a lot better about things and it's also helped me to realize that there are a lot of people in my life that care about me a lot more than I ever knew they did. Well, first, let me just start with my day.  I woke up this morning about 9:00. My mom wanted to take me shopping, and we took my dad and little brother with us. Well, before we left, my brother was annoying the hell out of everyone, so I just flat out told him exactly what I thought of him. And it felt really good. I was finally able to just get some things out in the open and get some crap off of my chest, so instantly, my day was better. I had a good time with my family today. My mom and I have been getting along super great here lately and I'm just smitten by happiness. I don't usually get to spend a lot of time with my family anymore, so today was great.  I got back just in time to go to work. Now, I had to work with Weldon tonight (he's the head cheese), and I don't usually get along very well with him. Well, he and I got along great tonight. He kept telling me that I was doing a great job and that he was so glad to have an employee like me and that meant a lot to me. Plus, I had a few really great tables. The people were so nice tonight and all of my tables tipped me quite nicely. I ended up making about $19.00 tonight, which is awesome...considering an average night is around $8.00. I just enjoyed work so muchly tonight!  Well, after work tonight, Kevin and I did some talking. I mean, really did some talking. Lately when he's been calling me, we don't really have the chance to talk about anything important and most of the time I'm in a really pissy mood, anyway. Well, he read my last post and I guess it really upset him. So tonight, while we were on the phone, he convinced me that he's staying around. He sat there and listed good qualities about me for I don't know how long. And even when I tried to protest by naming a bad quality, he just said, "Nope, that's cute, too." and he absolutely wouldn't let me be hard on myself. He let me know that he really does care about me a lot and he hates it when I'm hard on myself and wanted me to know how much he cares about me. It really meant a lot to me that I've got someone like him in my life that can make me feel so good about myself and make me so happy again. I don't know what I would do without him. And, honestly, I don't know how I've made it this far without a friend like him. He's so great. Not only is he sweet and thoughtful, but he's funny and he's got a great sense of humor and he knows how to make me smile. Plus, he's cute :).  Well, after I got off the phone with Kevin, I decided to go drive around the square (the Lamar hangout). I saw a big group of friends and I wasn't going to stop; I was just going to go on home, but I decided to go ahead a stop for a little while. I ended up staying for an hour and half...and I even got home a half hour past curfew (oops). I realized that I do have friends who care about me, even when I don't know they're there. Take my Cross-X buddy, Aaron. Most of the time when I talk to him, it's just about normal, everyday stuff. But last night, after he read my post, he was instantly there for me and willing to listen when I needed him to. And it really meant a lot to me that he was there, because I needed someone last night badly. And then the whole phone call with Kevin tonight made me feel better, too. Then, when I was uptown with my friends, they all made me feel like a part of the group again. It was so great.  This is one of the best days I've had in a while. I really saw that there are people around here that care about me and it made me feel good. I still miss Kevin a lot. I really wish he were closer to me. And I've still got a week until I see him, but I know we'll be OK. I think about him all the time and I know he's thinking about me, too. I think all of my ranting here lately has just been the stress talking. What with work and family and friends and an extreme lack of free time, I seem to be an overly stressed Whitney. Who knows? Maybe even one of these days I'll learn to relax...  Yeah, right :P.

      I didn't create this webjournal/blog/thingity thing to post my depression all over the internet. My original intent for signing up and creating this thing was so that I could post my somewhat amusing insights on the 'net for all to read/see. So far, though, I've had nothing to do except complain about the way things are going in my life. And it sucks. It really, really sucks. And I regret to inform you that this post will be no different than the ones before. I wish I had something inspirational/humorous/even remotely optomistic to write about, but it doesn't appear that anything like that will be post-worthy anytime soon. So, here goes another one of my sucktastic posts:  I complain about my job too much. It's true. It annoys everyone: Kevin, Johnny, my parents...everyone. I wish my job didn't suck as much as it does. It's not the people I work with. I love the people I work with (with the exception of a few), and honestly, I think that's the only thing that has kept me working at Pizza Hut for almost 8 months. The only thing that really just...burns me is the fact that I get paid $2.13 an hour to work in a horrible environment. Sometimes I bust myself doing things for the people I'm waiting on, and I get no tip. I mean, my tips are hardly anything to brag about and my last paycheck, for almost 24 hours of work, was $66.24. That's crappy. And I reported $44.50 in tips, so my tips weren't anything to skip about, either. And it's not like my tips don't get spent the instant that I recieve them. When you have a small amount of money all the time, it's really hard to just save it all. I'd rather have all my money on a paycheck than recieve it little by little. And it's not like I haven't tried to find a new job. It's not as easy as everyone wants to make it seem. You can't just walk into a place of employment, turn in an application, and say, "When do I start?" You have to get hired, and that just sucks for me. Since I debate, I have debate camp coming up in July and I won't be here during that month. Plus, I can't work weekends during the school year, again, because of debate. Would you want to hire a girl that can't work during July and can't work weekends during the school year? Yeah, I wouldn't either. So my life in the employment department...definitely sucky.  Then there's Kevin. I'm not complaining about him, by any means. He's probably the best thing I've got going for me right now. I really don't think he realizes how much he means to me. I know he gets sick of all my griping, and I wish I could be as happy as he is, but I'm stressed out  ALL THE TIME . He tells me that I need to relax and he tells me to chill out and be happy, but I really don't think he understands. He doesn't understand that I feel worthless because I know that, sometimes, he doesn't like talking to me. I think it's a clash in personality, and I know we can work around it, but sometimes I just wish that I could be the type of person that he would really enjoy being around all the time. I hate the feeling that he's too good for me. He's so happy and he's such a great person, and I'm always angry and stressed out and I'm not that great of a girl, so I don't even know how I'm keeping him around. I know I'm not the prettiest (by any means), or the smartest, or the nicest, or the most interesting person...so I'm afraid he's going to find someone else and realize that they're better for him than I am. And I hate that feeling. I keep telling myself that it won't happen, but honestly, it's hard to believe sometimes. Why can't I just please everybody?  I sound so emo. My friends would slaughter me if they read all of this. I'm not supposed to be emo. I'm not supposed to feel sorry for myself. I'm supposed to be happy all the time and pretend like everything is OK. Maybe if I did, people would stop telling me to learn to relax; maybe my mom (I love her, but sometimes she's such a pain) would quit trying to ask me what's wrong all the time. I wish I could tell her. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I could tell someone what's bothering me, and I wish someone cared enough to listen. I feel like every other stupid teenager that there is on this planet. It's not like I don't know how ridiculous I sound. It's not that I'm trying to get people's sympathies. Honestly, I don't care what people want from me. And yet, at the same time, I want to be accepted and I want to please everyone and I want someone to listen to me. That doesn't make sense. It just doesn't at all. I'm so confused with myself. I don't even know who I am anymore. I look in the mirror every day and see the same, blank expression, and I want to change it. I want to smile again. I want to smile because I'm happy and not because I feel like I have to. And I want to stop posting this crap. I promise that when I realize that life doesn't suck, I'll post something happy. Until then, adieu.

      Well, to start with, I'm really glad that Kevin is OK. I slept much better last night knowing that he made it to Virginia safely. So I thought I'd start this entry off with a little bit of optomism, since my life isn't usually very optomistic. On to the ranting!  As previously mentioned in another post, my summer has been the suck. There are a few reasons for this that have not been previously disclosed, so I thought I'd go ahead and do it now. First of all, I hate my hometown. It sucks...a lot. I'm convinced that it is impossible to find people to hang out with that aren't into drinking/drugs. I'm the epitome of a goody-two-shoes. I have never drank or done drugs before and I have no desire to do so...at least, I don't think I do. Sometimes it's hard to just keep saying no, because I figure that if I just go ahead and give in, maybe I'll instantly make friends or something. As of right now, I have almost no friends, at least in Lamar. Sure, I've got a few people that hang around and talk to me and pretend to be my friend, but they're more acquaintances, really, and I have almost nothing in common with these people. And it's not like I haven't tried to make friends. The fact of the matter is that I've tried, but I guess I'm not interesting enough for people to stay around and get to know me. I feel like going to school next year, standing on a table, and saying, "Hey, this is my senior year and none of you people know who I am. How about you take a chance to get to know me? Or how about you stop assuming horrible things about me before you take a look at who I really am? Sound like a good plan?" Another thing that really sucks is that my best friend in the whole world, Ashley Brewer, lives 6 hours away and the only chance I had to see her this summer (church camp) has been taken away from me. I miss her so much. She's one of the best people I know. She has a way of really uplifting me and helping me through the tough stuff, but it's really difficult because she lives so far away. I just want someone who will listen to me and hang out with me and want to do stuff with me. I've met so many people who have great friend potential, but none of them live anywhere near me. Why can't I just move to Kevin's town? There are some people there that would make great friends, plus I'd be able to see Kevin more. I definitely can't wait until I graduate and get out of here. I'll be moving and there will be more opportunity to make new friends. I'll just continue to busy myself with work...and then, when the school year starts, debate and homework. I'm usually pretty depressed, but it helps keep me sane. Screw people, they only hurt you.

      Yay! Kevin finally called me. After I sat here freaking out for, like, ever...he called me at approximately 9:22 p.m. Yeah, just thought I'd be exact about that. But anyway, I am so happy! No more cranky Whitney!

      And, just for future reference, the following bands rule:  Evanescence New Found Glory Relient K LostProphets Seether Queen AC/DC Smile Empty Soul Three Days Grace Maroon 5 Finger Eleven Linkin Park  And, the sucky music of the day is....  Jessica Simpson  *Cue clapping and cheering* Seriously. Anything that this female vocalizes sucks. She's just the dumbest thing in the world. "Is this chicken or fish?" How dumb can you be, woman? Why must you make the female population look stupid? And her music is annoying. "With You" has to be the most craptastic song I've heard in a while. I hate her.

      I hate people. No, really, I do. It's easy to guess my current mood: annoyed. Let me start at...where else? The beginning.  So last night, I sat in front of the computer (which is coveniently located near the phone) and waited for Kevin to call. He didn't. Of course, he was on the road all day yesterday and I did what any other caring girlfriend would do: I got really worried. I sat here talking to three of the coolest people ever (Will, Aaron, and Corey) and they all convinced me to call  him  instead. So I did. And you know what? No answer. That's right. I sit here for about 30 minutes trying to gather up the courage to call him that late (it was about 12:30 where he was), and then there's no answer. So I leave a voice message. I still haven't heard from him. And I miss him. And I hope he's OK.  AND I'M GOING CRAZY!   Well, after I called him last night, the three cool people (as previously mentioned) finally convinced me that he's fine and just didn't have time to call yesterday. Well, my friend Marcas got on MSN and started talking to me for the first time in I don't know how long. Marcas and I got in a huge fight about 5 months ago because I was dating his best friend and he didn't like it (because he has a crush on me), so he stopped talking to me and blocked me on MSN. Well, last night, he decided to un-block me and we decided that we would hang out today. I was supposed to try calling him around 2:00 (after I got off work, which will be my next paragraph), and if he didn't answer, he said he'd call me around 3:00. Well, I called him at 2:00. No answer. So I waited around for his call. It's now 6:19 and he still hasn't called.  Then there's work today. I always go in a little bit early. I was scheduled to work 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., so I walk through the door at 10:45 and Regina (head waitress) AUTOMATICALLY has a list of things for me to do. And I'm not on the clock yet, mind you. Also, I was supposed to have cook side training today, and Weldon (the head cheese) told me not to take any tables today. When Regina asked me to take some (because it was lunch buffet and we were packed), I said no because Weldon told me not to and she gave me the cold shoulder all during lunch. Then, when my trainer (Nikki) was teaching me how to cut pizzas, I screwed up a whole bunch of them. No, really. They looked  bad.   So basically, this entire day has been a big waste. Except I've had a lot of time to catch up with Aaron. I hardly ever get to talk to him anymore, and I'm always glad to have a friend like him that will talk to me and listen to me.  Right now, I'm overcome by this feeling that I just HAVE to do something all the time. This summer has proven to be extremely worthless right now. I haven't done anything at all. I mean, I've seen Kevin quite a few times and I've worked a lot, but I haven't accomplished anything. This is why I miss school. At least during school I have something to do all the time...whether it be debate, music, or homework. And that reminds me, I need to find a clarinet solo (preferably one that doesn't suck) to take to MSHSAA districts next year. I did really poorly at districts this year and I'd like to make it to state next year. I also need to start writing my O.O. for next year, looking for a storytelling piece, and filing/cutting UN evidence. I can't wait for debate camp!! It'll give me something to do!  I guess that's all for now. One final thought: meh.

      So today before I went to work, I decided that I wanted to buy a pack of gum. Specifically, Orbit Cinnamint gum (because Orbit gum rules). So anyway, I was going to go to Wal-Mart to buy my gum (because you know Wal-Mart, everything is cheaper at Wal-Mart), but I decided to go to one of the truck stops here in town since it was closer to my work place. I decided that I should only take a dollar in with me, because surely a pack of gum would not cost more than one dollar. I find my gum and take it to the register, only to discover that this was no ordinary pack of gum. Oh, no. It was a ridiculously expensive pack of gum: $1.15 to be exact. Now, ordinarily, $1.15 isn't that much money... but for a pack of gum?!  So, I only had a dollar with me, so I had to make a fool of myself and run out to my car to get the extra 15 cents. I hate it when I get ripped off.  Then, after the gum escapade, I get to work and I'm all excited because I'm working 20 hours this week and I'm looking forward to a sweet pay check. Well, the shift supervisor that I hate is working tonight (Satan goes by the name Stephanie at Pizza Hut) and we were completely dead. She decides that she wants to send me home three hours early. Nevermind that I protested...oh, no!  I  must go home early.  And to top it all off, Kevin left for Virginia today (Kevin is the uber-sweetie in my life). I don't get to see him for a week and half!! He lives 60 miles away, but we try to see each other at least twice a week. But I just saw him last night and I already miss him like crazy. GRR I MISS HIM SO MUCHLY! And he hasn't called me yet. He usually calls around 9:00 and it's now 10:30.
