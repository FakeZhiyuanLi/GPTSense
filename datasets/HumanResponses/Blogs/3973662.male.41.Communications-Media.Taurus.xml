      Why Good Girls Always Want the Bad Boys By Laura Snyder  "I just want a nice guy," women whine. Then they date the first drunken leather-clad jerk who spills his drink on her dress. What gives? Well, it's more than just because "nice" is generally considered shorthand for "boring sex." Here's why some babes love the allure of the bad boy.  It's Genetic  All of human history - and thus, our genetic programming -- rewards those brave enough to take risks. The cowardly caveman died in his lonely cavern, while the brave one ventured out and survived. Sure, the "dangerous" caveman might not be as pleasant to sit with by the fire at night, but he appealed to the cavewoman because he'd pass along stronger genes.  It's All In Our Heads  What's so sexy - and makes us feel so good - about being with the bad boy? For starters, he's got confidence, and that's sexy because it's a sign of strength. But there's more: dating the bad boy carries an element of risk. And risk triggers the production of the feel-good brain chemical dopamine. We may be intrigued by his notorious drug and alcohol problems (and he probably has 'em), but it's really our own "drugged" nervous system that does us in.  We Love a Challenge  Women love to play relationship therapist (just listen in on a conversation with our girlfriends if you need proof). In order to achieve this, we need to find a jerk to lie down on our couch. We love the idea of being the woman who solves this mysterious man's problems and turns him into our own Prince Charming.  We Know What to Expect  With bad boys, we know what to expect. We'll try to change them, it won't work, and we'll be left heartbroken. But, it will be entirely not our fault. Whereas if we date Mr. Nice Guy and doesn't work out, we're going to have to take some ownership of the failure. Some women are just more comfortable playing the victim.  ##

        The Newsroom Iconoclast  Adidas, and the power of 'the Rule of Threes'  Sunday, July 4, 2004     By Michael J. Bowers       &nbsp;   As I have written before, I don't love Germany like I did as a kid, when my family was living in a little town called Hohenecken and every block was a new, exotic adventure.        &nbsp;   The Germans' petulance last year on the way to a just war settled all those memories for good.       &nbsp;   However, there is one thing German that I still covet: the three stripes of Adidas.  The design, which appeared in 1949, is simple, elegant and exquisitely satisfying.       &nbsp;   On a gym shoe like the Gazelle or the Samba, the stripes produce a classic. And a wise man knows that when you have a classic, you don't mess with it.       &nbsp;   You might compare it to another example of great German design: the Porsche 911. On the road today, the car has the same essential shape that it had when it was born in 1963. It has been revised a little over the years, but that's all.       &nbsp;   Knowingly or not, the engineers in Stuttgart understand something that an old diplomat once said: "Sometimes when it is not necessary to do anything, it is necessary to do nothing."       &nbsp;   Part of the beauty of the Adidas stripes lies in the Rule of Threes. Jason Meyers writes about communication technology for Primedia Business Magazines. But he knows the rule embraces all fields of human endeavor:       &nbsp;   "Dividing things into threes is universally acceptable," he says. "There's Aristotle's principle of the three unities of time, place and action. There's Freud's id, ego and superego. There's the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."       &nbsp;   And so on. The rule also applies to jokes. Most have three acts. The first establishes the pattern. The second reinforces the pattern. The third twists the pattern to produce the punch line.        &nbsp;   Along the same lines, a good copy editor knows that when you must use a pseudo-word such as "argggh," it is necessary to stop at three g's. Why?       &nbsp;   Well, because.       &nbsp;   Two g's is not enough.       &nbsp;   Four is too many.        &nbsp;   "Arggh" does not satisfy, and "arggggh" overfills.        &nbsp;   But "argggh"? That hits the mark.       &nbsp;   For all its design intelligence, Adidas has fallen prey to one fallacy. They think spelling their name with a small initial letter ("adidas") is cute or something.        &nbsp;   It's not. It's hokey. It's so Seventies, like earth shoes and mood rings and those detaching pop-tops that we used to drop into our soda with such breathtaking recklessness.       &nbsp;   My college newspaper used to call itself "the daily illini." Once the logo might have looked avant-garde. But no more. We looked at it and thought "yuk." We capitalized the name and never went back.       &nbsp;   It's time for Adidas to do the same thing. In the meantime, adidas and other irritating names, such as k.d. lang and thirtysomething, have produced a schism on newspaper copy desks across the nation.       &nbsp;   The purist copy editor — and there's nothing wrong with the purist copy editor — says that if shoe companies and pop singers and television shows spell their names stupidly, then the newspaper is obliged to follow suit.       &nbsp;   On the other side, the grumpy and impatient copy editor (me) says:       &nbsp;   "Look, I don't have time for this nonsense. We are an English-language newspaper, and in the English language, proper nouns are capitalized. So adidas is going to become Adidas, and if they don't like it, too bad."       &nbsp;   The debate has yet to be resolved.       &nbsp;   Another divisive Adidas issue is pronunciation.       &nbsp;   My sister and I discovered the shoe in summer 1974, our last year in Germany, in an outlet store that was chockablock with stripes.       &nbsp;   We loved the shoes, we bought the shoes, and we pronounced the name the way the Germans do: AH-dee-dos.       &nbsp;   But in the fall we moved back to the States and discovered our new schoolmates insisted the pronunciation was uh-DEE-dus. We thought they were so stupid. We had just got back from Germany! We knew!       &nbsp;   But in the face of 170 million Americans pronouncing Adidas wrong, what could we do? Were our ears wrong? Should we be right and be thought stupid, or should we be wrong and be thought smart?       &nbsp;   Thirty years later, I was still conflicted. I avoided speaking the word at all.&nbsp; Then one day recently I remembered that I had a friend in Cologne, Germany, who naturally would know the answer. I sent her an urgent e-mail: AH-dee-dos or uh-DEE-dus?       &nbsp;   Ully wrote back: "Both a's are pronounced like the u in umbrella. The i is pronounced like ee in week. Stress is on the first syllable."       &nbsp;   In other words, for Mary and me, our ears had been correct all these years. This was a relief. But still there was the conflict about whether to speak wrong or be thought wrong.       &nbsp;   Ully advised: "Play dumb, like I do with that word in the States. You stand no chance against the majority, unless you want be perceived as a prig.        &nbsp;   "It's the same over here," she added. "People pronounce the terms 'online' and 'Excel' (software) on the first syllable. 'Excel' doesn't even make sense when you pronounce it that way, but if you say it correctly, nobody knows what you're talking about."       &nbsp;   I decided she was right. Which brings us back to where we started, the Rule of Threes.&nbsp;I conclude that when it comes to Adidas:       &nbsp;   --Pronounce it the American way.       &nbsp;   --Capitalize it.       &nbsp;   --And don't add a fourth stripe.       &nbsp;   ##

      Young Muslim woman strives to reconcile her two worlds  Sunday, July 18, 2004  By Michael J. Bowers &nbsp; After hearing for several weeks about the mean debate over whether three Muslim men should be allowed to build a mosque in Orland Park, I decided to attend the climactic village board meeting on June 21. &nbsp; I expected bitterness, and I got it. Forty-four people, most of them opposed to the mosque, addressed the board. Some of the things they said embarrassed me. &nbsp; On the other hand, a few mosque supporters said things I thought were unnecessarily hostile. &nbsp; In other words, neither side was completely right, and neither side was completely wrong.  &nbsp; The debate is now moot, of course. The board voted unanimously to approve the mosque plan.  Indisputably, it was the right thing to do. Construction will begin by September.  &nbsp; In the meantime, one moment stands out: when 23-year-old Huda Krad, daughter of one of the mosque founders, addressed the hecklers.  &nbsp; "I am so scared right now," she said in a voice that trembled just slightly. To many, she said, the mere fact she wears a head covering makes her a "degraded creature." &nbsp; "I was born and raised in this country," she said. Yet, "I feel there is nothing I can say to people here to convince them I am a good person." &nbsp; Huda's words reminded me of "The Elephant Man," the 1980 movie about the Englishman John Merrick.&nbsp; Merrick was born in 1862. As a child, he developed an unsightly facial growth that earned him scorn and cruelty. &nbsp; The climax comes when a group of men chase the adult Merrick into a train station. He turns and confronts his tormentors: "I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!" &nbsp; Not to say Huda is unsightly. Far from it. However, I heard in her words in Orland Park in 2004 the same fear that John Merrick must have felt at the hands of unthinking people in London in the late 1880s. &nbsp; And I wondered what it must be like to grow up with one foot in secular America and the other in Islam.  &nbsp; So one pleasantly cool night recently, Huda and her parents graciously welcomed me into their home on a quiet street in Palos Heights.  &nbsp; The four of us talked about many compelling issues. But eventually the conversation turned to the central issue: the mosque.  &nbsp; I congratulated the family on their success, and I acknowledged a few of the opponents were a bit ignorant.  &nbsp; But still, I said, do not these people deserve a little bit of understanding? Are there not many Muslims in America who do resent their host country? &nbsp; I gave a couple of examples. It pained the Krads to hear them, and it pained me to speak them. But I think the issue is central to the conflict. It must be discussed. &nbsp; One example came from a report in the Arizona Republic from November 2001. A 22-year-old man named Moayaad Hamad, wearing a Polo shirt, Nikes, Levi's jeans and a cell phone, said:  "It's getting to the point where I hate being here. … I don't think many (Muslims) are willing to say this, because they are afraid to say it. … The Koran doesn't justify taking out the World Trade Center, but Islam means not just peace, but freedom. You have to defend yourself." &nbsp; Here Huda's father, Mohamed, spoke up: "I think Americans have all the right to be scared. I am scared myself. bin Laden would call me an infidel." &nbsp; Huda added that Muslims are engaged in a fierce struggle over who owns Islam. The killers have seized the good name of her religion. &nbsp; "They changed the name, and they manipulated the name, and they spit it back at the people," she said. &nbsp; "And now we have to reclaim the name."  &nbsp; Here I realized radical Islam despises not only the West; it also despises any Muslim who dares cooperate with the West. In Baghdad, these three wonderful people would be marked for kidnapping just as soon as I.  &nbsp; Huda believes peaceful Muslims eventually will win the struggle. She passionately believes the solution is simple: People like Moayaad Hamad, the resentful young Muslim man in Arizona, must replace their ignorance with education. &nbsp; I believe her. But in the meantime, I fear many more good people will suffer violent death. A few days after we met, I discussed my conclusion with Huda by e-mail.  &nbsp; Huda was disappointed. "After sitting with you and talking about this," she said, "I'm saddened that I could not instill more hope for you. … Hope is what the people of Orland Park need now." &nbsp; But, Huda, I said: My conclusion is pessimistic because I am pessimistic. For example, a London Guardian poll taken in March shows that 13 percent of British Muslims believe another attack like 9-11 would be justified. &nbsp; Huda, give me reason to hope, I said. Convince me.  &nbsp; Huda responded by citing the Civil War. "President Lincoln had many around him that spoke of all the death that was happening." Blood flowed in rivers. "How many people asked the question, 'How many more people have to die?' &nbsp; "And when they asked that question, why didn't Lincoln share in their pessimism? I'll tell you why. Because he didn't look at the situation through a microscope. ... He looked at the situation with a greater vision." &nbsp; Hope is not an option, Huda said. It is an obligation. It is essential for change. Without hope, failure is guaranteed. &nbsp; And so I promised Huda I would hope. &nbsp; I will hope even more when we finish off the resistance in Iraq.  &nbsp; I'm not sure, but I think Huda would agree with me. &nbsp; ## &nbsp; &nbsp;
