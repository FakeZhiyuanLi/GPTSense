        Today, from The Net    Well, if you missed AMPED this sunday @ THE WAREHOUSE, you missed Curt and Paul checking out a Playboy to demonstrate how much people try to hide the fact that they are tempted by sexual sin. You also missed Dave's description of the nude beach he happened to go on while he was on vacation recently - it was pretty funny because no one who was on the beach without clothes was under 70 years old and Dave seemed to think it burned out his eyes.  Dave said that Porn is something we have to avoid and something we have to make every effort to stop dealing with. It's a bad problem, but one that even Bible guys,like David had, and were able to overcome, with God's help. You can do it too.  How do you avoid porn on the internet?

        Today, from The Net    Checking in from NYC - flew in last night to Newark, NJ, then drove up the New Jersey Turnpike - New York was all lit up - I could see the Empire State Building and saw the Statue of Liberty - and the place where the twin towers aren't anymore - and I was thinking: so many people and so few know the Lord. For those of you who know Nick Catt - he's coming here to NYC next year to help do a church plant - so pray for him, and for all here who don't know the Lord.

        Today, from The Net    First Wednesday away from The WAREHOUSE and you're missing the Worship, the Jones and the comfort of your small group, right? Well, I can't come to your place with a cart full 'o Jones Sodas (well, I  could , but it's a long way to your house!). And your small group is your small group.   But Worship - I can help you. If you're missing Justin, Rance, Erica and the other band members, then try going to  urlLink Worship music . All kinds of worship music resources - even the newest stuff. At  urlLink Sharesong , you get lots of chord and lyrics and even some downloads for your iPod or Rio. At  urlLink Pastornet  of Australia, you get a lot of stuff that sounds like the Hillsongs stuff that is so popular right now. And  urlLink Praisecharts  gives you news and some downloads.  That ought to get you to Vicki and the guys on Sunday. The Lord is to be praised - Praise HIM!

        Today, from The Net    Big news this week, wasn't it? All you can do is thank God for the time we had with Dave Milam and with Stan and release them to whatever God has in store for them. They won't be dying or anything. I get to Charlotte at least once a year and I plan to report! But Dave will stay in touch.   Dave P. is off on a well-deserved post-graduate vacation this week and Paul will be the speaker to AMPED about downloading and stealing: are they the same thing? I'm leading a discussion on Godly decisions with our High School group.  Can I ask everyone a question: Why does everyone want to talk to me? I get Gas and the disembodied voice tells me I am set for a fill up. I go into Wally-World and some old codger asks me how I am doing. I enter another store and a person looks up from apparent work to tell me hello. Can I tell you something? I know it's set for a fillup and I have other plans than to have a nice day and you don't really care how I am doing, now do you?  Sunday's comin'! Curt

        Today, from The Net    You Made it to Friday! Sorry, no Caffeine this week - look on the links at the side for the next one (May 28th).   Don't forget your problems - not as bad as old Lazerus - remember, he was dead, but Jesus Raised him from the dead, and he can do that for use both spiritually and in reality.  If you're a MP3 downloaded, bring your RIO or Ipod and your best mix of songs Sunday, dave would like to know your favorite downloading sites.  Later

        Today, from The Net    Today, at AMPED @ The Warehouse, we discussed our favorite Websites and Dave said that the Internet itself isn't a bad or a good place, but a tool you can use, just like most technology. He said that in the coming weeks, we're going to be discussing using and abusing the Internet. Some of the sessions will include: Internet Safety, stealing on the Internet, finding stuff about God on the Internet and the Internet and personal purity.   Dave took your web pages and gave them to me to post. So, if you want to see what your friends are looking at, click away. I haven't deeply investigated all of these websites, so you might want to click carefully. They look OK, but...   well, you know, we see all sorts of stuff on  The Net    urlLink Google  - good searching  urlLink Neopets   - the greatest Virtual Pet Site    urlLink Bored  - looks like a big link site  urlLink ebay  - online auctions  urlLink Yahoo  - one of the main internet portals  urlLink Alias-tv  - all about the show  urlLink Nick  - for all you Rugrats fans  urlLink Disney  - their main portal  urlLink InuYasha World   - Anime  urlLink YM  - the magazine and more  urlLink YYH World   - more Anime!  urlLink Adult Swim  - on Cartoon Network  urlLink Miniclips  - lots of games  urlLink Homestar Runner  - Home of Strongbad!  urlLink Cheat Code Central  - game codes and about a million pop-ups!  urlLink Blackborder  - apparently, lots of stuff about playing Magic  urlLink The Orlando Bloom Files  - apparently, almost everything you want to know about the guy who played the good looking Elf in LOTR  urlLink Hotmail  - a free mail address - especially for spam!  urlLink Netscape  - another well-known portal  urlLink Aol  - the biggest of them all  urlLink Dead Bob  - perhaps the best timewaster of all!

        What's coming up Sunday?    Who needs to wait until Sunday @ AMPED? You can start thinking about the nature of God right now? We're going to look at why God is so  different  than we are. God's nature is called "The Trinity" by some people and we'll look at where we see that in the bible.  We're also going to look at why Christianity is an  exclusive  faith. Jesus  says he is the  only  way to eternal life. That's different than every other religion you  can think of. That's gonna be fun.  See  you  sunday

        The Essentials   Sunday @ Amped, we learned about the essentials of Salvation, namely:  Faith in Christ, Repentance, Confession and Baptism.  Here's  a  couple of questions for you:  How important  is it to follow God's plan for you - is it more important than being popular?  If  you thought you hadn't followed God's plan, what would  you do?

        He's Baaack    Back from Camp and vacation and the rest, The Net is back on line.  Whoa! Just heard from those Senior High Campers at EMERGE. EMERGE and AMPED worked together to build a house for someone who needed it and between EMERGE and AMPED over $4600 was raised to build the house and the high schoolers actually built the house (well, everything except the roof) this past week at White Mills. Yeah!  Now for those of you who missed AMPED or EMERGE (Shame on you!), White Mills was awesome this year. Key cool new stuff!  -- The flavorings for the coke machine   -- The Teams course  -- The barnyard smell in the EMERGE tent  -- Sliding in the mud!

       Tomorrow @ Amped    &nbsp; Mormonism is the topic, as Dave will tell you about the differences between Mormons and historic Christianity. Uh, it's pretty different, and we look forward to your comments here tomorrow.

Don't forget: Kings Island Trip for Junior High and Senior High, August 3.&nbsp; $26 for tickets.&nbsp; Sign up at the Welcome Center at church. &nbsp; Any questions, call David P. at 288-9061, ext 15.

       Today, from The Net     &nbsp;  Can you dig it? Our time talking about Islam this past Sunday @  AMPED  was pretty interesting. We talked about the 5 pillars of Islam, but more importantly, about the lost state of Muslims, according to the word of our Lord Jesus. It's important to tell them about Jesus' love for them, and His death for them in their place, as he died in our place.   Now, this Sunday @  AMPED ,  Big Dave   will be talking to you about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or, as they are often called, The Mormons.    Now, this is a group that calls themselves Christians, but clearly, they are not. Dave will tell you more. If you have had the Mormons come to your door, click the comment button below and tell us about it. How do you witness to Mormons? (The answer is "with great difficulty!)   Have an awesome week!

        Today, from The Net    Some questions - just click  comments  below and add a comment to answer  After learning about Wicca @ AMPED this week...  1. Do you think the Harry Potter movies are good for Christians to watch, or are they helping people know about Wicca?  2. There's a razor ad that says it "Brings out the goddess in you." Do you think this commercial is influenced by Wicca?

        Today, from The Net    Sunday @ AMPED, we will discuss Wicca  and its subtle way of pointing students toward eastern religious thought. Denial of Christ's salvation is  key to this group as is their pantheistic view of God.  Come with your questions.

        Today, from The Net    Last week, @  THE WAREHOUSE  during Amped, we talked about Hinduism and Buddhism. Guys and Girls, it's really important that we know that satan is out to make us not  follow Jesus and sometimes that by making us think the false gods others follow are real..  Pantheism - god is  in everything Polytheism  - many gods  The key to the eastern religions is knowing these two concepts.  Next  week - Wicca  I'll get you, my fine Pretty - and  your little Dog, too!

        Today, from The the National Bible Bowl Convention   Eastside's Bible Bowl team finished 49th in the national competition this year, making to the 4th round of the tournament. Bible Bowl is a bible quizzing program where competitors memorize parts of the bible and also various facts about parts of the bible and then compete with each other to see who knows the text better. This year the text was Joshua, Judges and Ruth. Our team did very well.  Next year, the text is just the Book of Luke. If you think knowing God's word so well that you could quote it would be a neat thing to do, then see Curt or email him.  and say a word of congratulations to KC and Beka Taylor, David Sadler and Donna Ferree. (Hannah and Abigail Jones, who go to Northside, also play on our team).
