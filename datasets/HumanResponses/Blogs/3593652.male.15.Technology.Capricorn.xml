      Well, all my family is back together. My brother Chris just got back from a one month missions trip in Nepal! He's really tired but it was an absolutely amazing trip for him. My dad will be getting back today from Reading, Pennsylvania. He works there every other week. We'll all be heading out for an eight day cruise in the southern carribean. We'll leave out of San Juan and go to many wonderfully relaxing places. I'm pretty excited as we'll be on the biggest cruise ship in the world right now. The Adventure of the seas is the flagship of the Royal Carribean line. I'll be out for nine days so I won't update here for awhile. The main thing I'll miss is my job as a 3D Modeller for a modification of Command and Conquer: Generals Zero Hour. The site that hosts it is www.cncgeneralsworld.com and they are a great fansite. I'm staff there and I'm also the lead modeller for the All-Stars mod. It's alot of fun and I enjoy modelling and talking with all of these great guys. Unfortunately there can be some stupid stuff in the main public forums so I stick to the staff forums where there's no profanity etc. Because I'm the only modeller they have, me leaving for a week is a big deal. I'll miss it for awhile. Well, I'm off to enjoy my day and go get some breakfast. I'll see about possibly putting in a blog or two while on my cruise. Later!

      Well, here it is. My first blog post. Never fully understood blogging. Figured it was kindof like publishing your journal for the world to see. I'd never do that so I don't quite know why I'm doing this. Doubt I'll do it long at all but thought I'd give it a try. Well, First let me introduce myself. I'm a 15 year old guy named Matt Weber. I live in Denver CO, and I go to school at Arapahoe HS in Littleton. I'll be a sophomore this upcoming schoolyear. I'm pretty psyched about that. I've got some awesome friends at Arapahoe. There's Kurt who's an absolute encouragement and an awesome friend. Then there's Nate who's such an awesome guy. I love hanging out with both of em. There's also a ton of girls I know. Katie, Jesse, Emily, Jamie, Taliyah, Stacie, and that's only a few. All of them are amazing. They all love the Lord and they have awesomely high standards. They don't flaunt themselves around like 99% of the girls in our society. Kurt, Nate, and the rest of the guys I know also love the Lord and have such awesome standards that It blows me away. We all encourage each other to stay strong and to grow closer in our walk with God. Well, that's the school world. As for my family, I've got both a Mom and Dad, and one older brother. My Dad, Stan, is an absolutely amazing guy. He's such an example to me. He's a godly man who I look up to immensly. My Mom, Jeanine, is equally amazing in her walk with God and is an awesome role model to me. My brother, Chris, is absolutely awesome. He loves God and he loves life. He's four years older than me and a sophomore at Colorado Christian University. He's always been there for me, and even though we've had our differences, I love him. I love all my family immensly. Well, besides school and family, all that's left is church and my Youth group. I go to Castle Pines Community Church. It's an awesome church and I know just about everyone there. Which is quite an accomplishment seeing as there are nearly 150 people at my church. However my family was influential in the start of the church, so I've been there for five years since the very, very beginning. We don't have a building yet and we meet in a local area elementary school's gymnasium. Our youth group started when we had around four kids. It wasn't anything life changing and most people didn't even come. Suddenly our youth group jumped to eight students. That's when our church realized we needed a full time Youth pastor. God answered that need in the form of the single most amazing youth pastor I've ever met and probably one of the more influetial people in my life. God blessed us with Beth Meverden from Galilee Baptist. She was new and hadn't been a youth pastor long, but everyone knew she was going to do great things. Since then, our youth group has gone from eight kids meeting at a house, to over fifty students meeting in our church office. Everyone in our youth group is amazingly close and we all love hanging out together. As for some of the people in the youth group, the first I'd mention is Ryan Decker. He's one of the most amazing guys you'll ever meet. He just turned 18 and he's still 16 at heart. He loves the Lord with all his heart and it shows in every aspect of his life. He's an absolute role model in my life and a great friend. Others I could say the exact same about would be Eric Jett, Tim Meverden, Dane Birtwistle, Cody Gerrard, Adam Goudy, Josh Rosa, Andy Denlinger and more. However, I'd have to especially mention an awesome kid named Keith Bultemeier. He and I are the same age and we've known each other since we were nearly four. We're like brothers and we both love to hang out all the time. Our youth group takes amazing trips. We just returned from our nine day Utah Missions trip. We went to tons of small baptist churches and did a ton of work for them. We did everything we could to encourage and serve these chuches in their battle against the overwhelming presence of Mormonism. It was one of the best trips I've ever been on if not the best. It was more than life changing. Well, It's pretty late at night but now you have a good view into my life and who I am. I'm going to go read some verses out of the book of Judges, and then talk to God about my day, and then sleep till ten in the morning. Later!
