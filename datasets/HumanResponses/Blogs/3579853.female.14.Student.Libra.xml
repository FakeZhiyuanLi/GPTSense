          Yesterday, I went with my mom to car dealership so she could get her car inspected.  Two weeks ago she had offered to take me to the mall near it, and to give me my clothes allowance early.  To a girl with no transportation, it was the perfect deal.  Plus, whenever I get my clothes allowance I get an itch to spend it.  We had lunch at a nice place called the Twisted Fork.  I had Seafood Pasta and it was really great.  I wish I could've eaten more of it, but for some reason I got full pretty quickly.     There was supposed to be a car wash today.  Unfortunately, it rained.  However, my mom thought I should still go and see if they were still going to have it.  The place where it is usually held is only about 3/4 miles away from my house, so it was all good.  I rode my bike over there, and got drenched.  Two people were there, telling people there wasn't going to be a car wash.  They saw me, and one asked what I was doing.  I replied that I had never before ridden during a rainstorm, and that it was a new experience.  I actually thought it quite exhilarating.  It was absolutely pouring by the time I turned and headed for home.  There was standing pools of water on the sidewalks, and many times did I get splashed.  When I reached my house, my old shoes were full of water and sloshed when I walked.  Contrastingly, my head was perfectly dry, due to the raincoat I had slipped on before going out.

          Nineteen people were struck by lightning all at once.  They were playing a golf game when the storm blew up and they all got in the car because they didn't want to be hit.  After a little while, the storm stopped and they thought it was safe, so they all got out.  The lightning struck, hitting one guy, then it arched to everyone else.  Four people were hospitalized, and fifteen others had minor injuries.  One hundred deaths a year are attributed to lightning strikes.  It is said you need to stay inside for half an hour after a storm stops.

          Birds are chirping outside.  It's around noon again.  The exterminators were supposed to come this morning, but I got a reprieve.  They're not coming until two.  Another lazy summer day is going by.  Each one, is pretty much like the last.     Pretty White Kids With Problems.  Have you heard of it?  It's a new show on TV.  Well, not really.  I was flipping channels, and it was on Comedy Central.  I think it was probably something to do with MadTV, but I'm not completely sure.  It was one of those spoofs, this one in particular making fun of all the shows like The OC and Northshore (that's the new one coming soon).  There was one adult with a bald spot, wandering around school, claiming to be "the same age as everyone else."  Jokes including such words about 'black' things, and the usual, "No offense, D.J." called to the one black kid, were also in the show.  There was even a theme song.     Just recently, when I got home from school.  I found a bird, lying on the sidewalk right near my door.  I wasn't sure if it was dead, possessed, or what.  Once inside, I went to tell my mom.  Apparently, the dumb bird had flown into our front door.  My mom hadn't gone to see it yet, but she had heard a loud thump.  Luckily, the bird only seemed to be a little dazed.  After we poked it, the bird went hopping on it's way.  It was a freaky experience though.  One I probably won't forget anytime soon.  I've never seen a bird act in that way.

          The sky was magnificent yesterday.  All dark clouds rolling in.  I thought for sure it would rain.  Unfortunately for me, it did not.  I happen to love the rain.  I always have.  There's something about it that's just simply wonderful.  It can evoke so many different emotions, that otherwise might be left untapped.  When I was younger, whenever it rained, I would go out on our screened-in porch and just sit there and watch and listen.  I don't believe I could be happy living anywhere that it did not rain at least sporadically.  In this, I take after my dad in his strange ways.  He loves gray skies better than blue, and he likes clouds better than nothing.

          In Arizona, just this past week, I first saw the Sleeping Indian.  It's actually not called the Sleeping Indian, though.  That's just what I named it.  It's correct title is The End of the Trail.  During this last family vacation, we went shopping several times, but I only bought a few things.  One of those things was a little figurine of that Sleeping Indian.  Just in the past couple of years, I have started a very eclectic collection of figurines.  So far, it includes a set of three red stone horses, a crystal swan, a glass fish and turlte, and the indian.  I know, it's not much, but these things take time.  Most things I see are expensive and let's face it, I'm not rich, or anywhere close to being rich.     When I was little, my mom bought me rocking horses.  So, I also have a collection of rocking horses.  Zillions of rocking horses.  Okay, maybe not that many, but I have at least four shelves of them in my room, and I have a rocking horse christmas ornament for every year for eleven years.  The christmas ornaments are from a series, and I was supposed to get one for every year I've been alive.  However, when I was twelve, the series changed, and we stopped getting them.  All of the rocking horses is my room have nothing in common, excepting that they are rocking horses.  Some are wood, some are plastic, and some are porcelin.  I even have one that's made out of cloth.

          Sometimes, I think I think too much.

          Beep Beep Beep.  Well, there goes the alarm.  Another new day dawns.  No, not really.  For one thing, the sun rose several hours ago, and my alarm never works on days when I don't have school.  Actually, sometimes it doesn't work on days that I do have school.  That can be a problem.     I didn't get up until about 11:30, mainly because I stayed up all night semi-reading a romance novel.  I seem to be pretty much addicted to those things.  My mom has actually (finally) given me permission to read them.  It sure took her long enough though.  I started sneaking them in the sixth grade (after she told me I wasn't old enough to read them) and she's caught me once since then.  She was pretty mad, but my parents are the sort that don't stay mad for long, and are actually pretty great.     I love romance and happy-endings, which you can almost guarantee with those books.  I really don't like it when things end badly.  I don't mind it if there is bad stuff in the middle, because you can be sure it will get better by the end.  Not so when something ends badly.  There is no way for it to get better then.     My former foreign exchange student, Kath, just called to say she got back to Germany safely.  We had to go to the airport very early yesterday to send her off.  It was very sad.  She had been with us for almost ten and a half months, and we could not have asked for someone better.  A couple of years older than me, we did not exactly get along as friends.  Having to live with someone is a lot different from getting to know them through school or church or sports.  In short, we became like sisters, with all the fights, arguments, and angst to go along with it.  Actually, it was not so bad.  We didn't fight that often.  It was probably harder for me to get used to having a sibling in the house though, for I've been practically an only child for most of my life.  My brother got into the Marines right out of high school, and has only been back periodically since he got out.  He doesn't live too far away, but he doesn't come to our house that much.  I believe that he doensn't think that I can carry on a conversation with him, since he's eleven years older, so he never tries to talk to me.  I'm convinced he liked me better when I couldn't barely talk at all.

          The corks on my clarinet were all dried out, so I had to rub cork-grease into them.  Before I could practice, I had to suck on my reed to get it all nice and juicy.  If you've ever tasted one, you know they're not very yummy.

          Thunder's rumbling off in the distance, but so far there is not even a hint of rain in the air.  The sky is not cloudy, just that full-over whitish color that hangs low and oppressive over everything.  It's late afternoon, but has not even started to get dark yet.  Summer... the sun sets late this time of year.  Although, I'm looking at this summer in a different way from all the summers that have come before.  There's no school.  It may sound strange to you, but that's a big change from what I'm used to.     The bleeping from my family's answering machine sounds intermittently belowstairs, but it's not a message for me.  I should know, because I listened to it.  It's a message from my brother to my dad, asking for help with a computer problem- something my dad knows all about.  He's one of those computer engineers who knows just about everything about computers and technology and all that jazz.  Comparatively, if my brother even gets near a computer, it spazzes.  There must be something his makeup that just makes computers impossible for him.  It is probably not that surprising though, for he is my half-brother, so he did not get any genes from my father.       The wind's picked up a little now, rustling through the trees in the front yard, and there's the front door opening.  It will be my dad, for he called just a few minutes ago to say he'd be home.  He says he's picked up my clarinet from the shop.  Several weeks ago I dropped it, and just a week ago we were finally able to take it in to be fixed.  It was messed up pretty bad, but luckily I could still play on it.  However, I need to go check on it now because I start lessons tomorrow with a new clarinet teacher.  He wants me to prepare music/solos to play so he can evaluate my level.
