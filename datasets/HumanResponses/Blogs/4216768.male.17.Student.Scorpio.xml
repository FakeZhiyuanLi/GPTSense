      I'm mentally preparing myself for my journy into Western Psyche. I told myself that Monday, one week from the last time I went, I would return.  So I now wonder what this will be like now.  Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise, then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up, and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed, but not just a small pile, a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.  She is a Democrat.  She is my oasis in this world of unlogical happenings. She is so beautiful. I will marry her someday, I know it in the deepest parts of my soul. The sticky parts.

      Each raindrop not only soddens the ground more, but makes my mood more and more solemn... It gives you time to brood with cold toes and numb hands. A loss for words though, with such a think haze over everything. You walk out side to be speckled with drops of mist. The wind bites your skin in this Pennsylvania August.  Sarah is in the hospital. I am reluctant to visit her. I have more important things to do. Or not. I'm simply proving my strength by rejecting her. I blew off a girl in the hospital. I destroyed Tuesday's visiting hours for her. It just sets in how evil that sounds. I was in the area twice since. Neither time have I visited. It is sweet karma though. Upon her whole family. Her brother is in a sanitarium in Utah, she's in one in Pittsburgh. Ah, the beauty of having copious monies.

       Welcome to RueStVincent. My new blog and personality.  I'm finally away from that goddamn Xanga. Too popular.  I like this one's style though.  It will be bad that my friends are not in the same blog though.  Sucks for them though.  I like Blogger better.
