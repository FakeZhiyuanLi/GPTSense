      so im still here . . . in rockland i mean . i was kinda aiming to leave the country , but going half way across it isnt to bad of a start . flying's one of my most shiverish fears . by the way for future reference - i like making up words . just thought u should know . back to flying - im scared to death that something bad will happen . actually , i guess i already know something bad is going to happen ; possibly nothing terrible , like in a situation where we have to jump out of the side of the plane into some ocean off the coast of a rocky island that just so happens to have cannibals living on it that just happen to not have eaten in over a month , plus the fact that the captain forgot to mention that we have no parachutes so all 30 of us in the plane are all going to make the most painful bellyflop of our scrawny lives . or i could just scream when i flush the airplane toilet so someone has to go in and assist me . or i could just spill my drink . no matter how horrible it is , something  is  going to happen on that plane . in lighter news , this is our 10 year going to good ol' vermont . we've had some good times , but i fear this will be the ending light in which we may never return as a whole support system once more . translation from my moment - this is going to probably be the last year all of us will be there : my sister's going off to college along with another person from the other family we go up with . but that is why we are going up for a longer period of time and being corny - yes ladys nd gentlemen , we have made t-shirts .

       im goin to start a protest against adults . just adults in general , and everything that has to do with that particular subject . some adults , who's names shall not be used , are excessively pushy and over protective of my friends , in this i mean who i can see . but i find it funny that these nameless parents will step out of the way to have certain people over yet they can toss the fact of others away like auntie em's house on a windy day . also , other people who think they are adults are going in my protest bc , mainly , they just annoy me to shreds . but i must give credit to those who are and have recovered from overexposure of adult activity . bravo , and keep up the good work ; for my sake and yours . amazingly , a protest is a thrilling thing to do in my life , but the fact that is a protest amongst myself doesnt exactly add that kicked that i'd like outta life . . . o well for now .
