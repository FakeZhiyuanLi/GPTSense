      Hello out there in TV land!&nbsp; Welcome to  Scandalous Life .&nbsp; This will probably just be a photo blog as I am not a very good writer.&nbsp; I am not especially good at taking pictures either but I like taking pictures whereas I do not like writing.&nbsp; Enjoy!

      Vase with a bear on it=fun. Having to get the invasive pop-up ads from hell removed from my work computer today=not fun at all. I suppose we all have our struggles.  I had to remove the "Hello" picture sharing thing from my main work computer so there will be a short hiatus for picture postings. My secondary work computer needs to get bug pimped so that I can use it safely for all of my web searching needs.  After that, I will be able to start posting photos again.  Until then...

       urlLink     "The Coolest Vase Ever! Yay!"  Oh yes. I am the proud owner of that vase with a bear on it. It is so fantastic that it brings tears to my eyes. My goal is to always have it dispaying some kind of plant-life. Really, this vase should have it's own channel on the TV so that people from all over the world can turn it on and look at it whenever they want. I am certain that it could be a precursor to world peace. How do you like that flower arrangement? I got 5 or 6 mosquito bites picking the flowers for it. But that vase deserves flowers and I wasn't going to let those little blood suckers get in my way of making sure that the vase with a bear on it fulfilled its plant-life dispaying duties. Ahhh. A thing of beauty is joy forever! urlLink

       urlLink     "Mystery Bouquet"  Oh, I just feel terrible about this one. This isn't the for real and true Photo of the Day for 8/16. Nope. I did actually take a picture on 8/16 but it was a self portrait of me laying on the couch. Ugh. I like self portraits but this one just screamed "I AM A BIG PRETENSIOUS DORK THAT TAKES PICTURES OF MYSELF MAKING SERIOUS FACES!". That is just not good for anyone.  urlLink

       urlLink    " Red Delicious Apple Head " I don't really have much to say about this photo except, WHY oh Why has W magazine dressed my lovely little flower Scarlett like a scary SM Dom?  That does not suit her!  If I were the photographer, she would have been perched on the top of gigantic ice cream sundae like a human-cherry beacon of hope.  Oh! And Dave dear, she is 20...not 18.  I am not a dirty old man after all!  urlLink

       urlLink     "Cat Brains Being Blown"  Here, Jesus knocks on the door of my Cat's brains.  He wishes to bring you all of his happy 3-D news Hannah!  He'll be there all day, knock knock knockin and you will be there, mesmorized by his realistic 3-D form.  Jesus never gives up.  Thats right. urlLink

       urlLink     "What Have I Done To Deserve This?"   urlLink    Seriously. Have I neglected some basic rule of housekeeping? I never leave dead bodies laying out for more than an hour and I keep all of the dog shit in the closet upstairs. And how exactly are they getting into my house?!! Many are on the  outside  of the window...it's like they are clamoring to get in!

       urlLink     "Lord of the Flies...I think Piggy May Be Dead and Rotting Underneath My Window"  Ok, this is so gross that it may actually qualify as scandalous. This is my kitchen window with some kind of Fly Family Reunion going on. I vaccuumed up a bunch of them but this morning it was even worse!   urlLink

       urlLink    "Granny Bugs" Here is my first Photo of the Day here at Scandalous Life. I suppose my plan is to take a picture every day and post it on that day. I probably will take more than one picture and choose my favorite. I really wanted to get started on August 1 but it didn't work out that way. I had been on vacation so there is a bit of a back up this time. urlLink
