      For my bulimics...eating four cupcakes will make you spew the contents of your stomach.  Unfortunately, I swallowed mine, which is why I'm drinking water.   I watched one of my favorite movies, Forrest Gump.  I love that movie.   Also went putt-putting today...forgot to mention that.  I tied for second the first time, won the second.  I failed to win at the games...tip of the entry: anything you put coins into to knock off coins is not worth tokens. I love getting my butt whooped at internet checkers.  For once, I'm actually winning.  Yea, I won!  I guess people are stupid at 11:15 PM.  I'm tryin my hardest to stay up for SNL, which is why I'm at the computer and not watching the news...that always puts me to sleep.  Last week, I fell asleep one commercial before the opening skit (my sister told me). Two games in a row won!!!  Three!!  You know, this makes me think about my cousin Stephanie.  We haven't played internet games lately.  Actually, we haven't really seen each other lately. For my perverts out there, does holding up two fingers really mean you want to get some?  Some people tried to tell me that, and I got it flashed to me twice yesterday.  I personally don't believe it, but it could be true.  Well I g2g.  Later.

      I love Mexican night.  I chop lettuce, brown and spice hamburger, and make refried beans like noone's biznass.  I feel sorry for my parents' care group guests.  As one can see by the title, I'm going to be extremely flatulant tonight.  If I had it my way, I wouldn't have to see them at all...if all goes according to plan, I won't have to.  My plan: watch Friends until 7:00, take a hour-long bath, and watch Forrest Gump (one of three all-time favorites) at eight. Well I g2g cause I have to go to care group.  New plan: watch Friends until 7, find some way to occupy myself till 8, then watch Forrest Gump.    Your: Happy eyes! Your cheerfull, bright and always want to try something new.

      Two tips this time: blow thingies that dentists have and noses don't mix.  Of course, I didn't actually put it up my nose, but I did think about it (lol).  Clean bill of health for my teeth!  My teeth hurt from flossing though.   Second tip: don't throw a glass of water on someone unless you're prepared to take a glass of icy water.   I have an audience!  A friend of mine came up to me and told my table everything on my site!  If you want to speak ur mind to him, IM Ben: crazzybomber  Congrats to me...I jacked those two tests (translation: I did well on my math analysis and English tests).  I was the first done on both!

      And that's my tip for the entry!  It really, really hurts.  When you do so, it gives you a headache only comforted by Outkast's Hey Ya...As Jessica puts it, it's America's guilty pleasure.  My favorite lines: "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!" "What's cooler than being cool?  Ice cold!" "Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor!" Anyway, I. won the Key club election.  BOO!  I can't stand him!  He's such a butt munchie!  You know, it would be cool if there was a candy called butt munchies.  It could be white chocolate and milk chocolate, with caramel in the middle for the stuff that comes out butts!  That would be soooo cool!  There could be white shapely female butts, then hairy male butts.  Bennifer butts!   Yea I think I've heard shake it like a polaroid picture like 15 times.  I've got Hey Ya on repeat.  There's this weird noise I just noticed in the chorus.  There's also this weird song on there called the morning after.  It sounds like Denzel, which is 'Tise's favorite actor.  I don't see it in these older actors.  Ashton - hot...Brad - hot...George Clooney and Denzel Washington - I just don't see it.  It's funny...both of them say their eyes are pretty.  I personally prefer Brad Pitt and Prince William, although a few of the guys at TD r hot...I'm not sayin who b/c lots of ppl at my school read this.

      For the three of you that actually read my blog and have been waiting with bated breath, here are the Keyette election results! President - Kim (I didn't vote for her, but she's going to bring back the Key/Keyette sleepovers, so that's good) Vice President - Lindsey (yay!) Secretary - Lauren (yay!) Treasurer - Shaheen (yay!) Historian - Paige (ran uncontested) Chaplain - Melissa :(  Most of the people I voted for won, which is good.   Hooray for a straight haircut!  My mom evened it yesterday.  Today I flipped it out and curled the end, and I don't look like my grandmother!!!  Yay!   Tip: When wearing skirts for a week straight, make sure to shave one's legs (unless you're a guy...that's not only fruity, that's weird).   Anyway, today's an even day, which means journalism, math analysis test I didn't study for, yearbook, and English test I didn't study for.  Well I can study for math analysis during journalism, English during math analysis, lunch and yearbook.  If you must choose between math and English, always, always, ALWAYS study for English.  That's a tip.   Well, I need to study for English, so I'm going to end this hand-crippling typing.  I'm probably gonna have arthritis because of this.  Later.    You are going to marry Orlando Bloom. He will always treat you right and is very romantic. He will do anything for you. He is very polite and has deep brown eyes and is very good looking (which is another plus!). He can make anything cheesy look really hot(like sliding down stairs on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy ears for example).

      I had a very enlightening chemistry class today!  I didn't learn anything about chemicals or gram formula mass, but I and three other girls did talk about sex the entire time.  I think that a class as boring as chemistry should be devoted to talking about that.  I have found two things to be true about the sexes: 1). Girls love to talk about sex, and 2). Guys like to sing.  I wonder why more guys aren't in chorus? You know, I'm a very sheltered child.  It's sad that two sophomores had to inform me what riding the train is, and what a boner is.   Aah.  I feel good.  I knew that I would.  I feel nice.  Like sugar and spice.  Ok, enough with the song lyrics!  Back to introducing a word into the English language (see last entry).  I would like to see foamin as the new WORD (the expression).  I personally like Dumas as a substitute for... well, you know.   My face feels really oily.  I wonder why adolescents get oil.  Really, shouldn't we get something productive, like money sprouting from our oversized pores?  We have to pay for makeup, shampoo/conditioner, face wash, some clothes, car stuff (insurance, payments, gas), AND lots of other stuff, like movies.  I have the best idea for a birthday party.  We go to the restaurant Pizza Hut (or Cici's for the more economical option), then go see a movie.  I know!  It can be called dinner and a movie!  Oh wait, that's already taken.  Darnit. Why do people laugh differently?  It just occured to me cause Young was laughin about something, and I was thinking about how it sounds so different from mine.  And why do we have different voice pitches.  Oh great now I'm thinking about that stupid credit card commercial where everyone looks the same.  Those are some UGLY girls that are like that guy.  My favorite commercial is that Geico one where they're all talkin about how great they feel with their hair growing back, and the physician comes on and says something about baldness being bad.  Then, "But I do have some good news." Announcer: "The John Parker solution to hair loss?"  Parker: "No.  I just saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico." HAHA!!  I like the name Parker.  Lennox is cool (trivia question of the day: Where did I get Lennox from?  See the end for the answer. Oh crap.  I just remembered that Boswell's study session is going on right now.  Hope I'll be ok...I went to the one yesterday.  We're having a Macbeth test tomorrow.  (that would the the answer to the trivia question.)  I don't understand it when I read it alone, but when she explains it, it makes sense.  You know what I want to hear right now?  Britney Spears, Toxic.  I'm no Ms Brit fan, but I do love that song.  There's just something about it that makes it irresistible. Keeping with the irresistible theme, those little packing peanuts.  Right now I'm trying to blot my face with them.  They're actually quite effective.  Also, they're fun to step on.  I hate peanuts.  I stopped eating Snickers because of it...I'm more of a Caramello, Milky Way and Twix kind of person.  I love caramel.  Can you tell.  HAHA! That rhymes with caramel!  One would think I'm high while writing this.  It's sad...I'm not.  Actually, I've never gotten high in my entire life, or gotten drunk.  Still an unpolluted virgin with a healthy liver.  *sigh* Well, my ride is almost here (I'm still at school).  G2G.  Later.

      Here's an advertising tip: put, in 138 font, free _______ (something that nearly everyone likes).  Under it, type the thing you want to advertise.  The big letters catch people's eyes, and the idea of free anything draws people in.  I just designed a flyer, and it's going to get lots of responses.  Place your message on flyers, screen savers, boards, on websites (like this one) and get people to advertise.  So far, no luck on human advertising.   Well, I'm at school now, and I'm freezing.  One thing's for sure: if it's cold outside, TD is sure to be colder, and hot if it's hot outside.  Why am I freezing?  Another tip: if you cut your hair uneven, and your mom says you have to do a million things to get her to even it, and she doesn't, don't walk to school in a mini skirt! (unless you're really, really mad.)  The fact that my sweat is beginning to freeze has something to do with it.   You know, guys have it sooo much easier.  At the editorial board meeting today (newspaper - yes, I'm a newspaper freak), we were discussing how guys have it easier; we never discuss newspaper.  It all started when Sarah began putting on eyeliner, and Aaron asked if it would hurt if the pencil was pointed.  Then began a discussion of prom (guys only pay $120 for tuxes, we pay upwards of $150), hairstyling (guys rub gel through their hair for two seconds, girls straighten or curl for at least 15 minutes), and makeup (guys none, girls take 20 minutes to get it right).  I think that for one day, guys should have to apply makeup, wear dresses and stilettos, style hair and go tanning.  That would be fun. For all the Keyettes out there reading, remember: Patricia for President, Lindsay for Vice-President, Lauren for Secretary!  I'll post election results tonight.  Later.  You are Eleanor of Aquitaine.  She was a strong- willed queen who knew well the duties of her life.  She spoke up where other women remained silent; it was only the 1100's.  Life is sometimes hard for you, with many people against you, but you can survive in this hardship.  You have your ideas in your head and it takes a long time to get them out. Sometimes you feel frustrated because others are not as good as you, but you love with a passion and fight for what you believe in. Please rate my quiz.  I cant say I dont wish to sound desperate, because I am.  So that doesnt help much.     urlLink What famous female ruler are you?

      What do you think of cherry flavored stuff?  We have pi day at TD, a ruse to garner funds for the math department to buy batteries.  Hey, wow, I used two vocab words!  Back to pi day.  The math department offers small pies for a dollar each, and they're in six flavas - cherry, apple, pecan, lemon, chocolate èclair and blueberry.  I love apple pie.  It's yummy and reminds one of the bread store.  Lemon and chocolate èclair are good too.  I was just thinking about cherry flavored stuff when I looked at my sister's cherry flavored lip gloss.  She ordered seventeen and they gave her this cherry-red makeup bag and it had cherry lip gloss, Neutrogena shampoo & conditioner, and Neutrogena body wash.  Seventeen's actually a pretty cool magazine.  It's not just about articles like, "The makeup to make him notice you!" or "Fifteen dresses that make you look like a skank!" (because most teen magazines are incapable of using a period).  Like right now, I'm reading an article on North Korean girls sold into slavery.  That's soo sad.  I honestly could not be someone's servant...I suck at serving people.  The one time my sister bribed me into being hers, I took all kinds of breaks and quit after taking a long bath.   Ever listened to reggae?  I mean, besides all the rastafarians out there who listen to it because of religious reasons.  Do rastafarians smoke weed because of their religion?  I know people who smoke it, but not for religious reasons.  I think it would be awesome to be smoking it and when someone says something, you could say, "I'm fufilling my duty to God to smoke this."  That reminds me of a poster in the journalism room.  It makes religious philosophies out of the phrase, "s**t happens."  Here's the link: http://www.thejaywalker.com/pages/shit_happens.html.  I think Andrew found that site.   Where does the word "random" come from?  I have the most random thoughts, like this one :Who invented the word random?  I know that some guy said that he could introduce a word into the English language, then wrote quiz all over Dublin, and that's how teachers can give us abominable mini tests.  How does one go about introducing a word into the English language?  Brittany (from yearbook) and I tried to start the word popalar, but we forgot over winter break.  It would be cool if we had eighteen words for snow, like Eskimos do.  There could be yellow snow, wet snow, snowball/snowman snow, sledding snow, and so on.  Actually, I would rather have warm temperatures than eighteen words for snow.  Well, I have one last thing to say: ***SHAHEEN FOR WORLD DICTATOR!!*** Later   Eight indicates the possibility of great success in business, finance, and politics.  You are practical, ambitious, commited, and hardworking.  You can also be jealous, greedy, domineering, and power-hungry.  Eight is said to be the most unpredictable of numbers and can indicate the pinnacle of success of the depths of failure; it can go either way.

      I read somewhere that if you squeeze your butt 100 times a day, you can ward off depression.  My prognosis: I don't feel any happier, but I do have one very sore booty.  Anyway, I just finished watching The Simpsons, a parody of life itself.  I absolutely love it.  Any show that can satirize history and make a history lover like myself laugh is definitely on my to watch list.  My top 10 list of shows is (in random order): -The Simpsons -Friends -The OC -Las Vegas -Eight Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter -The Monk -Law and Order -The Tonight Show -SNL -Seventh Heaven Well, that's it for now.

      Ok I'm not going to give a cast of characters.  Instead, I had a thought: what would the world be like if guys wore dresses and makeup, and girls wore gel and short hair?  I was just thinking - I gave myself a horrendous haircut (my mom's going to straighten it out later today).  I was massaging the shampoo in my hair, and I was thinking about A., and how he would look much better if he wore a little mascara to darken his long lashes, and then it hit me: what if the roles were reversed?  Anyway (I recently learned that anyways is not a word, and neither is irregardless - it's regardless ;D), I just wanted to write it down before I forgot it.  You know, it's nice having shorter hair.  I don't have to use as much conditioner, it takes a shorter amount of time to blow dry and straighten it (actually, I curl it at the ends; the minute amount of curl is usually gone by 1st period), and I can still wear my hair every way my mom said I couldn't wear it if I cut it shorter.  I can still braid it, wear it in a pony tail, curl it (although I slightly resemble my grandmother), put it in a bun, and wear a half ponytail.  Is it pony tail, ponytail, or pigtail?  Just wondering, why must we name hairstyles after animals?  Can't it be a tail?  News flash: since I don't want the psychos in the woodwork to go stalk the people in my life, I'm going to use first names or first letters when I'm talking about people.  For example, tomorrow, I'm going to ask my friend Ashley if she notices anything different - she'll stare at me for five minutes, then Monica will say, "Wait I think it's her hair."  Then she'll stare for another five minutes, and say, "I think you're right."  Then I'll grow tired of the charade, and tell them it's my hair.  The only sad thing about my hair is that I've lopped off most of the naturally blonde part.  My hair's hilighted from about an inch from the end up.  Speaking of which, I need to rehilight it; the roots look strawberry.    Apollo    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      My sister is in huge trouble!  She almost started a fight and got in trouble with the police.  She's grounded now, like me...except I'm not sure if I'm grounded or not, cause I watched Friends, The Simpsons, and got online.    Anyway, I'm just waiting for my grandfather to come and take me to my house.  I forgot my calculator, lip stuff, bookbag, money and a shirt to go under this one...it shows too much!  I wish I could just go to sleep instead of coming back though.  I went to sleep kind of early too.   TGIF!  I showed my mom my interim (we finally went out for making straight A's for semester...gotta love Cici's), and she was "disappointed" in me b/c I got two B's.  Actually, I'm glad they were B's and not C's like I thought they would be.  From now on, I suppose I'll actually have to pay attention in Chemistry and Math Analysis.  They drag on FOREVER!  At least I have lots of people to talk to in Chemistry...In Math Analysis, I'm surrounded by people I can't talk to. (except the hispanic ppl in my class...they're amazed that I am half Puerto Rican and have blonde hair and green eyes). Speaking of which, I had a dream that we decided to go to Puerto Rico in March and in July, and I hadn't packed.  Strange enough, I was in the journalism room, trying to find everything so I wouldn't miss the plane.  Even more strange is that I actually was finding stuff.  At least it wasn't about snakes. It's only 7:30?  Gosh, time is slow!  Hopefully, it won't speed up again when we get to my house, cause I don't want to miss 3rd period.   You know, I don't have a single scrapbook.  I was just thinking about that because I was looking up at all the pictures in the journalism room.  It might be nice to have one to *capture the memories* (note the sarcasm).   I'm not sure what I'm going to do this weekend.  It's going to be pretty hot for Virginia's March.  Today, it's supposed to exceed 80° (hence, the corset/tank top I'm wearing that shows a lil too much of my chest.  That reminds me; I need to put batteries in my calculator.  Don't ask how I got that from revealing tops.  Well, it's 7:40, so I better go outside and look out for my grandfather.  Later.    Wonder Woman (Diana, Princess of Themyscira).

      For slouching in church (this should give u an idea of my parents), I got grounded from everything.  So, from now on, I have to write in this during school.  I'm slowly regaining privilleges (I watched Friends and the Simpsons and Eight Simple Rules last night, even though I'm grounded from TV). Guess what!  I might get my mom's car!  Now don't say I drive old ladies' cars...I thought I would have to bum rides all through high school, so any car is good.  I would love to drive a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible, but hey, that's not gonna happen anytime soon. Tip of the day: If you're an evil dictator with sights on ruling the world, read 1984.  That's what I'm writing for my research paper.  It could be as cool as that book that details how to be an evil world dictator.   Well I have a headache.  After the next paragraph, I'll peace out.  Later. I found this good site.  I'm going to edit every entry to post one in every entry. Here's today's:    You're a Caramel!!  You are known for your sweetness.

      I HATE SNAKES!!!!  And right now I hate Fear Factor.  They showed a preview with snakes in it, and I had a horrible dream about them.  I think that snakes should be removed from the planet.  They're nasty creatures that have no purpose besides haunting the dreams of countless ophidiophobiacs.  They're evil, disgusting and scary.  I would never, ever, EVER date someone with a snake, or be friends with one.  It's the reason that I can't become a veterinarian, unless I could limit my practice to non-reptiles, besides iguanas and turtles.  Are turtles amphibians or reptiles? Anyway, I loathe snakes.  In the dream, a snake was crawling on our kitchen table, and it wrapped around my hand and bit me.  I chopped off its head, and the tail jumped up and hit me, and then I was sitting on another snake that bit me in the butt.  It really freaked me out.      Unity. You Turly Desire Unity. You wish that the world was together as one, and world peace was among us. You enjoy sitting in natures peaceful spots to get away from war and hate.

      We had care group at our house today.  That means regressing to a ten-year-old to play hide and seek, be loud, and snort at my dad's pronounciation of "de body of crees brokeen for ju" (translation: the body of Christ broken for you).  It was pretty fun.  Right now I'm playin mommy cause Leslie, an angel of a toddler when she wants to be, is wheezing in the next room.  I'm also very full from hawaiian bread, which, by the way, is the best bread ever.  Well ok I had a few ham biscuits, and some other stuff (not to be listed so I don't look like a glutton at a church function).  A new couple came today; they want to start a Spanish church in Chester cause the Spanish population here is increasing  210%  each year.  They want my dad to translate or something.  Anyway, their two boys are pathetic hide and seekers.  Brb I heard Leslie wheeze again.  Nope she's just snoring.  Well I think I'm going to take a third nap cause I want to be really awake for SNL.   That reminds me of something hilarious on Jay Leno (one of my favorite shows btw)...they made a kids' version of the board room from The Apprentice, and they had a kid that looked amazingly like Donald Trump with three kids.  Robbie, you peeked during hide and seek...Robbie, you're fired!  LOL!!  Later.    You are CLARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL.  She is a rad chick with absolutely no fashion sense.  If you are a guy and chose this... you are gay.      urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Which is, by the way, a quote from The Simpsons (lol).  I'm having one of my favorite candy bars, Milky Way, for breakfast.  I love caramello, twix, reese's, three musketeers, hershey's white chocolate, and white crunch candy bars.   I'm having the most horrible dreams.  Last night, I dreamt that me and I. went on a date, and at the end of the night, I went inside and let a snake in (then I woke up)!  The night before, both of us were rehearsing a scene from Romeo & Juliet, a kissing scene, and we were just up to the part when I woke up.  I can't understand why he has to invade my dreams.  The last time I dreamt about someone THIS much, I was in like with him (I've never been in love).  The difference: I HATE A. with a passion.  And no, there's absolutely no chance I've crossed the thin line between love and hate.  He's conceited, self-absorbed, cruel, annoying, thinks he's much more intelligent than he really is (I'm ranked higher in our class), rude, and short (well that lines up with my type, but I could never even tolerate the other characteristics).   Well my stomach doesn't feel so good, so I'll keep it at that.  Later.    Watch the hands!  Hey, they're your money maker! You're not too fond of having a camera stuck in your face all the time, so you'll let your hands do the work!  Brilliant!    urlLink   What Kind of Model are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Yeah, it's disgusting, but I was hungry.  I haven't thrown up yet tho.  Brb someone's at the door. Oh, it's a neighbor.  For some reason he's been coming over and using our phone...I think his service is down. Yummy in my tummy!  I just had grilled cheese and soup.  Mmm mmm good!  That Charlie's Angels movie's tonight.  I think I'll watch it...that one about Three's Company is pretty good.   Well I'm playin checkers again, and it's definitely only late at night that I win.  She or he has outnumbered me seven to three.  Ouch.  Yeah, I just lost.   Hey, have you seen those muzzy commercials, and the girl says jes sui lajum vi (I know that's grossly misspelled, but I took three years of Spanish, not French).  Anyway, I learned that it means I am a little girl.  Yay! I love this song...it's one of a handful of Britney Spears songs I actually like.  I dunno, that song  Toxic  just makes u want to dance.  I'm also into that Linkin Park  Numb , Jessica Simpson  With You , Usher  Yeah  (another song that makes me want to shake, Sheryl Crow The First Cut Is The Deepest  , Outkast  Hey Ya , this song called One Thing that goes If I traded it all/If I gave it all away for one thing/Wouldn't that be something?  It's really annoying cause I love the song.  Also, Five For Fighting  100 Years , Limp Bizkit  Behind Blue Eyes , and Maroon 5's  This Love .  I have very odd tastes, don't I?  Lots of pop, some alternative, a tiny bit of R & B.  I wish I still had Kazaa (I took it off the computer in lieu of all those lawsuits) so I could download them.  If I drank a LOT of Pepsi, I could do it (lol it would cost me like $30). LOL!!!  I wonder if my chem class reads this, cause I'm listening to  Milkshake  by Kellis.  Elizabeth, Katy, Mallory and Emily had to tell me that "milkshake" is not a milk and ice cream treat u get at McDonalds!  It's kind of gross, actually.  How can u teach someone to make their "milkshake" (lol) to be better?  Well if watermelons (haha Emily!) make guys' "ice cream" better, I suppose eating strawberries or something might help.  But I'll have to charge for that tip lol. Enough gross talk.  Yummy...Troy's opening May 14.  Maybe I can do that for my birthday...go to CiCi's and then to watch Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and sum other hott guys in a history flick...sounds like the ultimate birthday!  Maybe I can have a sleepover!   Well I have to take a bath.  Later. By the way...for all u haters on santa, u can't say he doesn't exist!!!  Look at this!

      Flanders (to Homer): Thanks to you, the Trojans will be known for their excellent wood skills!  LOL!!!   Today is open to interpretation.  One could call it horrible, because I had to get blood drawn (and I'm afraid of needles, called Aichmophobia or Belonephobia), my arm hurts a LOT and I had nothing to eat for 17 hours (admitted, nine of them I was asleep).  I had to get some blood tests done for a doctor. (not elaborating on that one!)  My day could also could be called good, cause I didn't have to go to school, I got to eat Subway (one of my favorite restaurants), and I finally got to see that movie,  Thirteen , which I've been dying to see since forever.  Either way, my arm hurts and I'm tired.   I have found an awesome way to pass time and make my parents ashamed: Wheel of Fortune, the computer game.  I usually win, so it's great.   Right now, my dad's making fun of me because I flinched when the technician came at me with the needle.  What can I say, I have some phobias: Selachophobia, or fear of sharks; being buried alive, or Taphephobia; corpses (I suppose that rules out a career as a mortician), Necrophobia; obviously, injections, Trypanophobia; Vaccinophobia, or fear of vaccinations, and Arachibutyrophobia, peanut butter sticking to the roof of one's mouth (just kiddding on the last one).  For the complete list, including a fear of virgins, go to phobialist.com . I have two good jokes for you.  One may seem a bit weird because it's a blonde joke, and I'm blonde (talk about irony).   The first:      Three women were set to be executed, a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead.  All three chose to be killed by firing squad.  First, the brunette stepped up.  The executioner said, "Ready, aim..." and the brunette shouted, "EARTHQUAKE!!"  The gunmen, distracted, started to panic, and the brunette got away.      The redhead's turn was next.  Taking her cue from the brunette, she shouted, "TORNADO!!!" when it was her turn.      Finally, it was time for the blonde.  She figured out the other two's tricks, and decided to benefit from their idea.  So, the executioner said, "Ready, aim..." and the blonde shouted, "FIRE!!!"  LOL LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!!  The second:      A millionaire was hosting a huge bash at his house, and being a generous person with way too much money, decided to set up a challenge.  He said, "I will give the person who can swim across my pool anything they want.  The catch: it's full of sharks."      Almost instantly, a man leaped into the pool.  All the sharks went to him, but he managed to escape just in time.  Tired and achy, he pulled himself out of the pool.        Being a man of his word, the millionaire said, "Alright, what would you like?"      The man who swam said, "For starters, I'd like the name of the jackass that pushed me in!"  I have a third, but I'll save it for next time, cause I think this entry's long enough.  Later.    Your Energy is Yellow.  You are generous, bright, and expressive. An excellent communicator, you keep your audience captivated with your animated storytelling.  Sometimes you talk too much, but when you learn to listen you will be sought out for your talents to advise.  The communications field appeals to you as a profession.

      Bart: Who knew that a play where everyone dies at the end could be so boring! Homer: It's not only a great play, it's also a great movie called Ghost Busters!    LOL.  Lots of people are reading this now.  Just today Big C (what he wishes people would call him, his real name's Cory) told me that he heard about it.  At least I definitely know that I. doesn't read it, cause it would suck if he made my life hell over it.  The thing that really freaks me out though is that Cory guessed who I. was.  LOL he agreed w/ me!  I think that most people agree, actually.  Most people like his hot brother tho. Right now, I'm watching that Simpsons with Frank Grimes.  The one where his son tries to murder him is awesome!   I really don't have much else to say.  I.'s a butthole.  Later.    You are the chinese element of Fire.

      I foolishly ate my lunch three hours early, so at lunch I was hungry.  So I went to the yearbook room in hopes of getting some money and there were donuts.  I must have eaten five Krispy Kreme.  Sooo good but so fattening.  I can feel my stomach going from sticking out to pot belly.  God help me if I ever become an alcoholic.   Anyway, this girl in my chemistry class found my site and checked it out.  More and more people are starting to read this!  I better keep the I. trashing to a minimum...that wouldn't be good if my site went the way of the "Girls of Chester" (a site describing all the Chester sluts).  Anyway, I'm just waitin for my mom to come so I can go home and do some MORE hilighting.  I've already gone through 100 pages.  I'm tired of hilighting!  I really want to take a nap, but I should probably make some progress on my research paper. Oh so many pimples erupting on my face from Krispy Kreme goo! Well I should probably wrap this one up.  Let me just get some Quizilla results on here and I'm done.  Later.    Pop punk...  I'm not really that fond of you, but you can churn out some good stuff...

      Today's my grandfather's bday, so shoutout to him : HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!  Actually it's a bit ridiculous cause he's never used a computer in his entire life.  Oh well.  So we're going to his party around three, and then to care group.  Jenni's having her friend Maisie spend the night.  She's one of my favorites of my sister's friends...just bursting with energy and vitality.  Actually, there's only a couple of Jenni's friends that I don't like, actually. My throat hurts really badly...I'll spare the mucus details.  First my back, then my throat...as soon as one heals, another thing flares up.  I hope the next one isn't a stomachache...I can bear colds, coughs, sore throats, even the flu, but I'm a baby when it comes to stomachaches.  I do believe they're the most abominable thing that can happen to someone.  Thank goodness that's the worst pain I know, although getting your foot stepped on by a horse and having someone crush down on your pinky toe with a chair are pretty painful too. U know what?  There aren't very many hot guys at our school.  No especially smokin guy to gawk at, which is a very dangerous thing for adolescent girls, who need someone to drool at besides hot guys from The O.C. and shows like that.  Actually, I think Adam Brody, the guy who plays Seth, is the hottest one on there [u'd think I'd like Chris Carmack (Luke) or Benjamin Mackensie (Ryan), but I don't think either is particularly hot].   I'm kinda fatigued (even though it's 9:30 AM), so I think I'll just end this entry with a quiz result.  Later.    Heaven: You are a true angel. You are destined to move on to a place where there is no evil, just people as beautiful and pure as you. Graceful and classy, an angel like you has wonderful things ahead!

      Octuplets: Mommy, please let daddy come back home cookie  I'm actually not too fond of that episode, but the quilt shredding one that came on afterwards didn't have ne good lines. Good news!  I found my cell phone and my coat in the span of a week.  Maybe I'll find some other stuff I've lost, like my first three retainers. Why do you think some people are mean?  We were discussing that during chemistry, and I can't come up w/ an answer.  Is it a need to look good?  Is it a pent up frustration?  Is it just cruelty?  Here's what Shaheen says: I believe people are mean because it makes them feel better about themselves to put others done. It is a twisted trait, but such is human nature. It's all perception.  Here's what my cousin Stephanie says: i dont know. Another deep question: why do we instantly hate some people and instantly like some people?  Most of the time hate or like/love develops over time, but sometimes it's instant.  Again, Shaheen's perspective:  TDMonMon05:  why do u think we instantly hate or like/love some people   TDMonMon05:  u there   Winkalink:  pheromones  Winkalink:  yes   Winkalink:  sorry, I was talking to Michael  Winkalink:  and I got sidetracked  Winkalink:  but I am here   TDMonMon05:  o     Winkalink:  yes:)  TDMonMon05:  what are pheremones   Winkalink:  pheromone:  Noun A chemical secreted by an animal, especially an insect, that influences the behavior or development of others of the same species, often functioning as an attractant of the opposite sex. Etymology Greek pherein, to carry; see bher-1 in Indo-European roots + (hor)mone. Other forms pher'o·mon'al adj. Well there u have it.  I wonder why chemicals can make us instantly attracted or repulsed by someone (by this time, my cousin was away so I didn't ask her). One more deep question: beyond pheremones, what causes a person to dislike or like someone (not necessarily instantly).  Shaheen's perspective:  Winkalink: behavior towards one another Winkalink: first impressions are a huge part TDMonMon05: well my first impression of u was that u were rele nice and u had pretty hair Winkalink: haha thanks :-) TDMonMon05: lets see...since ur talkin to michael, I thought he was rele smart and had nice eyes [a few deleted lines cause it's not nice to talk badly about people, which I realized today cause it's just as bad as teasing...so no more trashing people in my blog unless I'm really mad] TDMonMon05: I do remember mine of Cory, which was in second grade though Winkalink: ah, Cory:-) Winkalink: I remember that TDMonMon05: for kindergarten and first, Wells, and second through fifth Curtis Winkalink: I thought he said his name was Horn TDMonMon05: haha Winkalink: it was september 4, 2001 TDMonMon05: I didn't like him very much cause he called me Nicholean the donkey (our teacher read us a story about Napoleon the Donkey) Winkalink: in geometry Winkalink: he was sitting with scott TDMonMon05: first day of school? Winkalink: who I thought was spot Winkalink: yes TDMonMon05: haha Winkalink: that's when we met TDMonMon05: were u in Mrs T.'s class? Winkalink: yes TDMonMon05: cool  As you can see, Shaheen's a genius.  I'll leave you with my usual quizilla results and this conversation which will serve as joke of the day.  Winkalink: I'm helping Michael start a classical music collection TDMonMon05: well I think that's about all as far as the deep questions. Winkalink: :-) TDMonMon05: haha make sure to get some Pink Floyd, Elvis, Joan Baez, and The Eagles Winkalink: no no Winkalink: not classic rock TDMonMon05: good music from every decade except the 90s Winkalink: classical TDMonMon05: those are the classics Winkalink: no TDMonMon05: o like with violins and stuff Winkalink: the real classics Winkalink: yes, with violins and stuff TDMonMon05: get mozart, bach, betovhen, tchaikovsky, and wolfgang puck Winkalink: :-) TDMonMon05: o wait wolfgang puck's a chef Winkalink: I've got them all Winkalink: except that last one Winkalink: lol Winkalink: wolfgang was Mozart's middle name TDMonMon05: o  Well quizilla is broken, so no quiz result today.  I'll just have to settle for a newfound knowledge of Vivaldi as taught by Shaheen.

      Homer: stupid sexy Flanders I love that line. Anyway, I'm staying after school to finish up some stuff in a place where I won't be distracted. I have to finish typing up all the hilighted stuff for my research paper, finish my theme packet, and just chill out, eating the dinner described in the title (actually, I already ate it).  Right now, I'm listening to cheesy country songs cause I'm too lazy to get up and change it. Ok, this song is just too much, so I'm going to change it. Brb.  Back. Well I need to go search for some suitable jokes, so brb again. Here's a great list joke.  You've probably heard some version but some of these I've never seen before.  Take shopping carts for the express purpose of filling them and stranding them at strategic locations.  Ride those little electronic cars at the front of the store.  Set all the alarm clocks to go off at ten minute intervals throughout the day.  Start playing Calvinball; see how many people you can get to join in.  Contaminate the entire auto department by sampling all the spray air fresheners.  Challenge other customers to duels with tubes of gift wrap.  Leave cryptic messages on the typewriters.  Re-dress the mannequins as you see fit.  When there are people behind you, walk REALLY SLOW, especially thin narrow aisles.  Walk up to an employee and tell him in an official tone, "I think we've got a Code 3 in Housewares," and see what happens.  Tune all the radios to a polka station; then turn them all off and turn the volumes to "10".  Play with the automatic doors.  Walk up to complete strangers and say, "Hi! I haven't seen you in so long!..." etc. See if they play along to avoid embarrassment.  While walking through the clothing department, ask yourself loud enough for all to hear, "Who BUYS this junk, anyway?"  Repeat Number 14 in the jewelry department.  Ride a display bicycle through the store; claim you're taking it for a "test drive."  Follow people through the aisles, always staying about five feet away. Continue to do this until they leave the department.  Play soccer with a group of friend, using the entire store as your playing field.  As the cashier runs your purchases over the scanner, look mesmerized and say, "Wow. Magic!"  Put M&M's on layaway.  Move "Caution: Wet Floor" signs to carpeted areas.  Set up a tent in the camping department; tell others you'll only invite them in if they bring pillows from Bed and Bath.  Test the fishing rods and see what you can "catch" from the other aisles.  Ask other customers if they have any Grey Poupon.  Drape a blanket around your shoulders and run around saying, "...I'm Batman. Come, Robin--to the Batcave!"  TP as much of the store as possible.  Randomly throw things over into neighboring aisles.  Play with the calculators so that they all spell "hello" upside down.  When someone asks if you need help, begin to cry and ask, "Why won't you people just leave me alone?"  When two or three people are walking ahead of you, run between them, yelling, "Red Rover!"  Make up nonsense products and ask newly hired employees if there are any in stock, i.e., "Do you have any Shnerples here?"  Take up an entire aisle in Toys by setting up a full scale battlefield with G.I. Joes vs. the X-Men.  Take bets on the battle described above.  Nonchalantly "test" the brushes and combs in Cosmetics.  Hold indoor shopping cart races.  Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme from "Mission: Impossible."  Attempt to fit into very large gym bags.  Attempt to fit others into very large gym bags.  Say things like, "Would you be so kind as to direct me to your Twinkies?"  Set up a "Valet Parking" sign in front of the store.  Two words: "Marco Polo."  Leave Cheerios in Lawn and Garden, pillows in the pet food aisle, etc.  "Re-alphabetize" the CD's in Electronics.  When someone steps away from their cart to look at something, quickly make off with it without saying a word.  Relax in the patio furniture until you get kicked out.  When an announcement comes over the loudspeaker, assume the fetal position and scream, "No, no! It's those voices again!"  Pay off layaways fifty cents at a time.  Drag a lounge chair on display over to the magazines and relax. If the store has a food court, buy a soft drink; explain that you don't get out much, and ask if they can put a little umbrella in it.   Well that's all for now.  Later.

      Well someone from my chemistry class said she didn't understand one of my jokes from the past entry, so I'm going to just post jokes for this entry.  (don't worry they're easy to understand!)  A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What is politics?"  Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense,"  So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I Understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about." The little boy replies, "Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit."  One day, this man, Tony, died. When he was sent to be judged, he was told that he had committed a sin, and that he could not go to heaven right away. He asked what he did and God told him that he cheated on his income taxes, and that the only way he could get into heaven would be to sleep with a 500 pound, stupid, butt-ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it. Tony decided that this was a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven. So off he went with this enormous woman, pretending to be happy.   As he was walking along, he saw his friend Carlos up ahead. Carlos was with an even bigger, uglier woman than he was with. When he approached Carlos he asked him what was going on, and Carlos replied, "I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money...even more then you did."   They both shook their heads in understanding and figured that as long as they have to be with these women, they might as well hang out together to help pass the time.   Now Tony, Carlos, and their two beastly women were walking along, minding their own business when Tony and Carlos could have sworn that they saw their friend Jon up ahead, only this man was with an absolutely drop dead gorgeous supermodel / centerfold. Stunned, Tony and Carlos approached the man and in fact it was their friend Jon. They asked him how is he with this unbelievable goddess, while they were stuck with these god-awful women.   Jon replied, "I have no idea, and I'm definitely not complaining. This has been absolutely the best time of my life (and I'm dead,) and I have five years of the best sex any man could hope for to look forward to. There is only one thing that I can't seem to understand.   After everytime we have sex, she rolls over and murmur's to herself, "Damn income taxes!"  A man died and went to The Judgment. St. Peter met him at the Gates of Heaven and said, "Before you meet with God, I thought I should tell you -- we've looked at your life, and your really didn't do anything particularly good or bad. We're not at all sure what to do with you. Can you tell us anything you did that can help us make a decision?"   The newly arrived soul thought for a moment and replied, "Yeah, once I was driving along and came upon a woman who was being harassed by a group of bikers. So I pulled over, got out my tire iron, and went up to the leader of the bikers. He was a big, muscular, hairy guy with tattoos all over his body and a ring pierced through his nose. Well, I tore the nose ring out of his nose, and told him he and his gang had better stop bothering the woman or they would have to deal with me!"   "I'm impressed," St. Peter responded, "When did this happen?"   "About two minutes ago," came the reply.   Man: Haven't I seen you someplace before?  Woman: Yes, that's why I don't go there anymore.  Man: Is this seat empty?  Woman: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.   Man: Your place or mine?  Woman: Both. You go to yours, and I'll go to mine.   Man: So, what do you do for a living?  Woman: I'm a female impersonator.   Man: Hey baby, what's your sign?  Woman: Do not enter.   Man: How do you like your eggs in the morning?  Woman: Unfertilized.   Man: If I could see you naked, I'd die happy.  Woman: If I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing.   Man: Your body is like a temple.  Woman: Sorry, there are no services today.   Man: I would go to the end of the world for you.  Woman: But would you stay there?  Top ten ways to freak out your roommate: 10) Collect potatoes. Paint faces on them and give them names. Name one after your roommate. Separate your roommate's potato from the others. Wait a few days, and then bake your roommate's potato and eat it. Explain to your roommate, "He just didn't belong."   9) Move everything to one side of the room. Ask your roommate if he knows how much an elephant weighs, and look at the floor on the empty side of the room with concern.  8) Draw a tiny black line on your nose. Make it bigger every day. Look at it and say, "The hair, it's growing. Growing!"   7) Buy some knives. Sharpen them every night. While you're doing so, look at your roommate and mutter, "Soon, soon...."   6) Collect hundreds of pens and pile them on one side of the room. Keep one pencil on the other side of the room. Laugh at the pencil.   5) Tell your roommate, "I've got an important message for you." Then pretend to faint. When you recover, say you can't remember what the message was. Later on, say, "Oh, yeah, I remember!" Pretend to faint again. Keep this up for several weeks.   4) While your roommate is out, glue your shoes to the ceiling. When your roommate walks in, sit on the floor, hold your head, and moan.   3) Make a sandwich. Don't eat it, leave it on the floor. Ignore the sandwich. Wait until your roommate gets rid of it, and then say, "Hey, where the heck is my sandwich!?" Complain loudly that you are hungry.   2) Every time your roommate walks in yell, "Hooray! You're back!" as loud as you can and dance around the room for five minutes. Afterwards, keep looking at your watch and saying, "Shouldn't you be going somewhere?"   1) Talk back to your Rice Krispies. All of a sudden, act offended, throw the bowl on the floor and kick it. Refuse to clean it up, explaining, "No, I want to watch them suffer."        Three men die at the same time, and St. Peter greets them at the Pearly Gates.  "OK, you're into heaven, but I need to determine what kind of car you get for heaven, cause it's quite a big place."      The first man said, "I'll admit, I've been a bit unfaithful.  In 27 years of marriage, I've cheated on my wife at least a dozen times."      "Alright," said St. Peter, "you get a Pinto."      Second man said, "Of 45 years of marriage, I've only cheated once, during our tumultous first year of marriage."      "That's pretty good," said St. Peter, "so you get a Lincoln."      Before he even has to ask, the third man says, "My wife and I spent 63 blissful years together,  and not once did I even look at another woman."      "Amazing...you get a Jaguar," said St. Peter.      About ten minutes later, the first two guys saw their friend crying on the pavement.  "What's wrong?" they asked.      "I just saw my wife," the third man said, "and she was on a skateboard!"  Once upon a time, there was a prince who, through no fault of his own, was cast under a spell by an evil witch. The curse was that the prince could speak only one word each year. However, he could save up the words so that if he did not speak for a whole year, the following year he was allowed to speak two words. (This was before the time of letter writing or sign language.)  One day, he met a beautiful princess (ruby lips, golden hair, sapphire eyes) and fell madly in love with her. With the greatest difficulty, he refrained from speaking for 2 whole years so that he could look at her and say, "My darling." But at the end of these 2 years, he wished to tell her that he loved her. So he waited 3 more years without speaking, bringing the total number of silent years to 5.  At the end of these 5 years, he realized that he had to ask her to marry him. So he waited another 4 years without speaking.   Finally, as the 9th year of silence ended, his joy knew no bounds. Leading the lovely princess to the most secluded and romantic place in that beautiful royal garden, the prince heaped a hundred red roses on her lap, knelt before her, and taking her hand in his, said, "My darling, I love you! Will you marry me?"   And the princess tucked a strand of golden hair behind her dainty ear, opened her sapphire eyes in wonder, and parting her ruby lips, said, "Pardon?"

      I think it's because my dad bought this awesome Hawaiian sweet bread and he asked me to rub his head in exchange for some and I was bent over for like 20 minutes.  Anyway, my back aches now. This guy in my English class told me he found the site too.  At this rate, the entire class of 2005 will be reading it by graduation.  I wonder if I. has found this or not.  Hope not.  Speaking of English, we had a sub that was one of the teachers in our middle school, and I found out why everyone loves her.   Well I have two jokes.  Here they are:  Little Sammy was praying to God one night before sleeping, and his parents overheard him.  He said, "God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma, goodbye Grandpa."  The next day, Grandpa dropped dead of a heart attack.  A few months later, the boy said in his prayers, "God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, goodbye Grandma.  Grandma died instantly of a bus hitting her the next day.  About six months later, Sammy prayed, "God bless Mommy, goodbye Daddy."  Of course, Dad was plenty freaked out.  He used the utmost caution at work and took 45 minutes to make the 10 minute commute from work.  When he arrived home, his wife greeted him at the door and said, "You know, it's the strangest thing...today the mailman dropped dead on our sidewalk!"  And the second: A tourist was browsing Chinatown, admiring the signs, restaurants and shops.  He rounded a corner and noticed a shop entitled "Lars Olaffson Laundry."  Puzzled, he went inside and asked for the owner.  A Chinese man stepped up and asked him why he asked.  "How did you get a name like Lars Olaffson for your business name?"  "Is name of business owner," the man replied.  The man replied, "When I come to this country, I wait in line for Documentation.  A big blonde Swede stand in front of me.  'What's your name?' they ask.  'Lars Olaffson,' he say.  'What's your name?' they ask me.  'Sem Ting.'  Lol!!!  WAIT!  Don't shake your head and comment on how unfunny those are!  I've got more: A man received a call from his doctor.  His doctor informed him that he had bad news and worse news.  The bad news: he's going to die tomorrow.  "What's worse," the doctor said, "I couldn't reach you yesterday!" (yeah, it's kind of stupid but oh well.)  A pollster was taking opinions outside the United Nations building in New York City.  She met a Saudi, a Russian, a North Korean, and a New Yorker.  "Excuse me, what do you think of the current meat shortage?"  The Saudi said, "What's a shortage?"  The Russian, "What's meat?"  "What's an opinion," asked the North Korean.  Asked the New Yorker, "What's 'excuse me?'"  Ok, you can leave now.  I'll have to come up with better jokes tomorrow.  Later.    You are an ERASER! You spend your time helping people smooth over their mistakes.  It's a messy job, but you have the helpful attitude to get it done.  Your coworkers appreciate that you are so friendly and non-judgmental, but make sure they aren't taking advantage of your expertise. If you don't make people clean up their own mess from time to time you'll always be covered in dirt that isn't yours (and that's not fair to you because your kindness is so valuable).    urlLink   What Piece of Office Supplies Are You?

      Chinese fortune cookie writer: I should be in New York, writing jokes on popsicle sticks.  Then I would be making a difference.  My sister and I made up three top ten lists.  Since I gotta clean before Ashley and Maisie come over, I'm just gonna keep it to that.  Top 10 things you'd never hear MTV say: 10. Don't you think that skirt's a little too short? 9. And #1 on the Christian chart is... 8. We play too much rap! 7.  We need to play more country 6. Those tight capris make her butt look too big 5. Shield your eyes!  Her thong's showing! 4. Praise God! 3. We need older VJs 2. It's time to put The Osbournes out to pasture and the number one thing you'd never hear MTV say... 1. Less shows, more music!  My list of top 10 hottest guys of all time 10. George Clooney 9. Ashton Kutcher 8. Josh Duhamel 7. Matt Damon 6. Leonardo Di Caprio 5. Pierce Brosnan 4. Ben Affleck 3. Orlando Bloom  2.

      You know, I.'s really a nice guy.  APRIL FOOLS!  Sorry for breaking my pact never to mention something negative, but I just had to.  For all the pranks people have gotten me with, I deserve to get a few people.  Probably the two best: (1) This one actually happened yesterday, so I was off guard.  We had to write a paper defending or arguing against a ban on dihydrogen monoxide.  So I wrote a three page paper on why we should ban dihydrogen monoxide.  I said it damages the environment, contributes to childhood obesity, and endangers our futures.  For all the non-chemistry majors out there (which is pretty much all of you), dihydrogen monoxide is nothing but...water!  I felt like such an idiot. (2) At lunch, there was a cool looking stapler on the table.  Jherrica told me that it stapled colored staples.  So I decided to staple the air in order to see for myself.  It was a shocking stapler, and it hurt!  Later, she got a bunch of people and we were laughing like crazy.  I think Alex B.'s reaction was funniest.  She started screaming, and almost everyone at our table screamed too, and Brittany B. has a really high-pitched scream, so we almost choked from laughing.  Yeah, people were staring.  That makes twice I've gotten an electrical shock, but it didn't hurt the first time.  I pity people who die from electrocution (except people who do by electric chair...I'm a firm believer in the death penalty).   I'm reading an awesome book called the  Da Vinci Code .  I don't care what Shaheen says, it's an awesome book.  I think it's the one think that I have in common with Katie J.  I was shocked to find out two things: 1). Da Vinci was homosexual, and 2). Noah was an albino.  I also found something that might interest Harry Potter fans.  The professor of astronomy is Professor Sinistra...Sinistra can mean either left or evil.  Hmm... I invented a great snack for afternoons too, and it's easy even for hopelessly hopeless cooks.  Just preheat the oven to 350 degrees, then sprinkle shredded or thinly sliced cheddar cheese (mozzarella, Monterey jack, and sharp cheeses could also work) onto Texas Toast.  After the preheat is done, set the timer to ten minutes, and place the toast with cheese in the oven.  Take it out after the ten minutes are up, and enjoy! My finding streak has not ceased.  I lost and found my graphing calculator, and I found some of my favorite cosmetics - some great mascara, my second favorite blush that gives just a hint of a flush, and some lip glosses.  Hope I can find where I put my common sense.  I said some stuff in B.'s class that weren't very flattering of the possibility of me having common sense.  B: Would you want your significant other to say that your love is like a vegetable garden?  Me: It would be a healthy relationship...(to understand this one, you have to know that we were talking about deserts) B: So where's the love?  Me: In the desert?  The last one is too embarrassing.   Well I g2g.  Later.  (Quizilla's down so no quiz results)

      Homer: I love all queens, whether they be homecoming or dairy.  Actually, they episode that came from, The Regina Monologues ("The Simpsons are going to Great Britain!") is coming on tonight, Fox, 8:30. I suppose I should explain the title.  I had a dream about horses last night.  In it, my dad robbed a store and got my sister and me a horse and I was riding it all throughout Colonial Williamsburg, and then I saw a bunch of TD teachers and I returned the horses out of convictions.  Sure beats some of my "other" dreams. There were two very scary moments last night.   First, we were playing hide and go seek. (Yes, I do still enjoy it occasionally...got a problem with that?)  I was trying to outrun "it" and I put my hands out to tag the door and I fell through the glass.  Luckily, the glass didn't break.  My dad made me really mad cause he started screaming at me about the door, and didn't even ask if I was ok.  My mom says I'm extremely lucky...she knew a girl who went through a full glass door too and she got cut in half.  It's eerily similar to my accident ninth grade year.  I went through a glass door then too, but the glass did break and slit my right index finger almost to the bone...I needed seven stitches.   The second scary thing that happened happened to Jenni and Kayla (another one of my sister's friends...Maisie couldn't spend the night).  They were riding their bikes around the block, and these guys started following them!  They had to call my mom to pick them up, and then they followed them home.  That's really creepy.  I don't think my mom reported them, so I'll post a description on here (I'm going to do the same thing in an e-mail to the Virginia State Police).  They were riding in a dark colored jeep, and my mom got a partial license plate: KSK --72.  One of the guys had dark curly hair, sunglasses and an orange shirt on.  No one really got a good look at the other guy. I'm not sure what we're doing today...we did most of the housework yesterday...yes, Jherrica, we did the laundry (once, I wore a skirt because my mom hadn't put away the laundry and I told her so when she asked why, and every time since then that I wear a skirt, I tell her my mom put away the laundry).  I do know that my grandparents are coming over today for dinner...normally I love mac n cheese, but my mom used ordinary cheese, and it doesn't taste very good.   Well I don't have much else to say for now (translation: I want to read the Dave Barry column for today), so I'll leave you with my usual quiz result.  Normally, I don't care for Lord of the Rings, but this quiz result was really cool (and long), so I'm posting it anyway.  Later.    Your ideal Middle-Earth parents are Faramir and Eowyn!  Do you have any idea ho difficult it is to find pictures of your mom and dad together? Thats because Faramir usually holds the camera. Anywho, they are the prince and princess of Ithilien, which will naturally give you some sort of impressive title.  Your uncle omer is the king of Rohan, so when you were little you actually got that pony you asked for.  And a beautiful Mustang on your sixteenth birthday, too!  Considering who your parents are, youll probably be tall and attractive.  Your Middle-Earth mama is Lady Eowyn of Rohan. Shes one of the coolest women in the history of ever!  She faced down the Witch-King of Angmar and his fell beast for her uncle, so you know she will do just about anything to protect you. She will probably teach you to ride a horse and use a sword and spear properly, not to mention letting you visit your uncle Eomer and aunt Lothiriel all the time.  Your Middle-Earth dad is Faramir of Gondor.  He has a lot of official duties, but when he is finished for the day hel will spend quality time with his family.  Faramir is very intelligent, so he can help you with your homework.  If you are rambunctious it will probably remind him of his brother Boromir, so he lets you get away with an awful lot.  Word of advice: don not mention your grandfather Denethor.  Your dad doesnt want to talk about him.  Also, insanity runs in your family. (Maybe you will get lucky)  I hoped you liked my quiz.

      Homer: I love you son Bart: I love you dad Bart: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  It's been awhile...four days!  I've been so busy with enjoying Spring Break that every time I think of something to write, there's something to do.  The only reason I have time now is cause I'm procrastinating (one of the best pleasures stemming from school).   So far, I've gone shopping twice, seen  Jersey Girl  (I don't care what critics say, I loved it), been swimming and jacuzzi hopping twice, went to Chuck E. Cheese's (don't laugh, I had to take my sister and Kayla there...at least that's what YOU think), and designed several houses and community spots courtesy of The Sims.  It's funny what makes you cry.  Not a drop during  The Passion of the Christ  (and the toughest person I know cried during the movie), but  Jersey Girl  and  Tarzan  made me bawl.  Oh well.  Tomorrow, we're going to Maymont and to the pool/jacuzzi.  That's the beauty of coupons. I think I found a new favorite shampoo/conditioner.  There's this stuff called Tres Semme Hydrology that gave me really shiny hair, no easy feat.  And I need all the conditioning I can get...I rehilighted my hair.  It's a bit lighter, but it sometimes looks dirty in the wrong light from all the streaks. I can't seem to figure out why, but my hand's bruised on the right side of my right hand.  It's swollen too.  Maybe I'm a hemophiliac, and I need to suck my blood.  I once knew a girl who did that, but her sister would do it too, and she was normal.  One of the weirdest people I knew.  Andy and Vicky R. take the cake though.  She would throw fits, allow her little brother to run around in his underwear during a blizzard, and had a weird fascination with our pool.  He would hide and cry during thunderstorms, had an odd fixation with Egyptian culture/artifacts, and had a crush on me.  Odd. Before I go to sleep, I really need to finish these notes.  Or maybe I should finish in the morning...I'm kinda tired.  Actually, I just want to make Lexia fall for Bruno...sounds like Russian soaps.  At any rate, I g2g.  Later.  Lack of motivation has made me lazy, so just read Dave Barry for a joke: http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/

      Homer: I thought Grimey didn't have any kids Frank Jr. Jr.: He had a thing for hookers Speaking of which, we had to go to this out of the way place on Jeff Davis, which is right near Chester's landmark Snow White Motel (that's a joke, it's laden w/ drugs and prostitution).  I told my mom I wanted to grow up to be Snow White and "get" my seven dwarfs.  She told me I had a dirty mind and that I shouldn't dream of being a prostitute or a hotel desk clerk (I said after that that I would just be the clerk and watch some arma-get-it-on w/ the pimps). My eyes hurt intensely...damn job applications!!!  (disclaimer: if your business is one I'm applying to is one of the "damn job applications," don't be alarmed!  I still want to be paid to work at your establishment!  Hire me!  I'm desperate!)   Today was a very interesting one...we went to the Southern Women's Show, which means this is the three year anniversary of the unspeakable event that happened which will tramautize me forever...and don't try to coax it out, cause only my immediate family, grandparents, aunt/uncle, and best friends know about it.   On a happier note, the Southern Women's Show!  I got a foot massage, a very fake bronzer (so if I appear too coppery, it's not Cancun for a week, it's bronzer) and fake tan stuff.  As I speak, my face is becoming progressively closer to the color of dark chocolate, which isn't good!  You should see my mom's face...she looks black!!  It's sooo funny cause she forgot to do her neck, so there's about five shades difference in her face and neck!  My face looks bad, but my arms look great!  I'm FINALLY gonna be as dark as u Emily!!!! (chemistry class inside joke)   Speaking of my face looking grotesque, I got this thing done that shows the dryness of your face, and it turns out that my face is covered in acne and "clogged pores" according to the booth lady who wants my money.  Seriously, though, my face looked terrible.  It looked even worse, if you can imagine, when I got this photograph of how much sun damage has been done to my face.  It's kinda funny, cause my forehead is white, but the rest looks like I put on foundation way too dark.  I have terrible freckles on my nose, and again my pimples look bad.  I suppose I should get some face peels and sunscreen.  However, I'm a little reluctant to get the sunscreen thing, cause I had a bad experience w/ sunscreen today.  I got ten million samples of what I thought was this clear sunscreen.  Nope...it was foundation twice as dark as my skintone!  Fun fun.   After that, I got lots of job applications.  Here's a question from the Subway one...A customer's order comes up to 4.58, and she hands you a ten.  How much money do you give her back?  Well, Subway, it's one five dollar bill, one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and two pennies!  Yay!  Well I need to go relive an extremely embarrassing moment too humiliating for posting online...if I like you enough, I'll tell you Monday.  Later.  P.S. I exfoliated my face, taking off all that stuff...I just couldn't bear the thought of what might happen if I went to church like that.  Being recruited by the Village Boys or starring in another Survivor just isn't me.  My arms are still bronze though so don't u worry about me dissin ur tan Emily!

      Homer: television - friend, mother, secret lover!  I know, I haven't written in awhile.  I was busy on spring break, and it just gets easier not to write.  The fact that it's banned at school doesn't help either.  This is retarded: they've banned all humor and personal sites.  I can't do anything except read freakin dear abby and news of the weird.   Just a thought...why must we have nicknames?  I can see for the kid who's a boy named Michelle or something, but why for the kids whose parents weren't high when they named them (I actually know a girl whose parents allowed her to choose her own name...she was called Jaime until she chose Leanne).  Here's what cousin (cuzn if u live in Mississippi) Steph thinks:  Whatevr2005:  why do u think we assign nicknames to ppl   msmonkey1029:  i dunno  msmonkey1029:  inside joke? There you have it.  I'll admit I've given some nicknames in my day.  Just take my cat, for example.  Princess has many aliases, including, but not limited to: fluffy, pincess, ellysmay, pincess ellysmay, smelly cat, fat cat, constance, kitsy kitsy boo boo, bew bew, kitsy boo, kitty, baby, baby cat, and kitty kitty.  Quite a list.   Just finished reading some quality dave barry, who, in my opinion, is the greatest comic ever (other than the fecund brains over at The Simpsons, Friends, and all the other comedies I watch...basically he's an awesome newspaper columnist).  I also like reading Ann Landers, and, on occasion, Dear Abby, for their advice to some of the most messed up people in America.   Well I think that's a wrap.  I'm feeling a bit sick and think I'll lie down (curses, Dominique!!!).  Later.

      Homer: Whoo hoo!  I got my job back!  Typically, Simpsons quotes reflect my mood...sometimes, I'm giggly, sometimes sarcastic, sometimes (a lot of the time) angry, but right now I'm happy.  I did go to the painting thing, and it was actually a lot of fun.  I learned how to make stencils for six foot cards; how to use a roller to paint; how to paint giant hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades; and how to best soak the juice from your cellular phone.  I left it in the sun, which zapped the battery.  I was left in the sun too long too...I have a bit of color to my face (anyone can tell you I'm scary pale in the wintertime), but I got a terrible side effect.  I have the dreaded...drum roll please, along with scary duh duh duh dun DUN...redneck t-shirt tan.  If it were up to me, I would have worn a cute almost sleeveless shirt with skirt and high heels, but my mom made me change into a bleach stained polo with sweat pants.   Well I really need to write my rough draft, cause it's due monday and I lost my disk that had the entire thing, so I have to rewrite ten pages.  Later.

      What to do now?  I suppose I should prepare myself for awkwardness.  Actually, I may get my first dose today, if I fufill my duties as a junior.  If so, I'll be having a jolly good time painting stuff for prom, with a lot of people I don't care to see, and some people who are really fun to be around.  I was going to go work out this morning, extinguishing that possibility, but if I go there, I could only work out for like an hour, which leaves me less than 15 minutes of actual weight lifting once 30 minutes on the treadmill and 15 on the bicycles are subtracted.  So I'm really undecided right now as to what to do.  My gut tells me that I don't have to be around them a lot, that I can hang out with the fun people and paint, which I love, and help out prom committee (they're short on people for this).  My brain, obviously waking up from a two and a half month hiatus when writing is concerned (which isn't good cause I have to do my rough draft, and I can't do it while my brain's groggy!), says that I'll see those people, have to spend a lot more time than I have to with them, and hear the first of a never-ending wave of , "Hey, that was so touching, that apology.  *Sob*," or "God it took you long enough to figure that one out," or "You know, initials aren't really a great coverup when his are A.I.," or a long list of quotes I'll be hearing from now till graduation.  I think I'd go into shock if I didn't get a huge amount of backlash Monday.  That reminds me of a  Grease  song that really fits this situation, "What will they say Monday at school?"  In my opinion, John Travolta's singing voice isn't that strong, but back to the subject of trying to get over myself. Actually, I've procrastinated long enough, and had a pity party that I now have to clean up for, and I just need to, as Mallory told me yesterday, "Move on, and don't make a big deal out of this, cause it's not like he's hurt or anything by it."  It may shock you, but I would feel horrible if I made someone cry or feel like crap because of this, cause I definitely know what it's like to feel that way because of someone's comments.  Well, I would definitely feel terrible if anyone besides Alex got upset...like Cory, which made me feel like some kind of monster...but despite all the comments, and all that, I might feel a small bit of remorse if he did feel bad. Ok, what happened to not discussing it any further?  Well I want to discuss it further, so I'll not bore the non TD people with meaningless names and drama.  Later.

      Homer: D'oh I don't think a Simpsons quote ever fit an entry so well.  I've actually written three versions of what I'm about to say...two people have actually made revisions to it, so that I don't sound incredibly bad, or stupid.   The drama, the drama!  High school is all about the drama, and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot.  I've had more DRAMA packed into today than I know what to do with.  I'll start off with one of my famous top five lists - what I wished I knew when I entered high school. 5. "The internet is no place to publish anything you want to be private...that's what the corner of your room is for" -Candy K. 4. If you dislike someone immensely, he/she will automatically assume you're in love with him/her 3. If you profess your dislike of said guy/girl, everyone in the entire school will assume you're in love with him/her 2. If you piss off a rapper, the world will become much clearer cuz at the speed of light he'll spew all the stuff no one wants you to know, but knows. 1. If you write something about someone, there's no way to take it back, unfortunately. Now that that's clear, yeah I found out a lot today.  It's in the form of the good, the bad, the ugly, and the hideous.  The good - the pissed off rapper will forgive you if you eradicate all mentions that could get you in trouble, and apologize for the world to see (see bottom).  The bad - Alex has been reading this since I started it...insert foot in mouth at this point.  The ugly - EVERYONE knew about this, except me...apparently, it's FUNNY to let someone go on and on while the person at whom venting is directed knows all your inner thoughts...jam foot into esophagus.  The hideous - the reason why I have so many people reading is because I have a publicist I didn't know about - Alex.  At least ten people have told me that he was the one that told them about the site...look up a surgeon to remove foot from stomach. What's worse - I feel like a jackass, cause he would never have known about it had I not left my freakin journal up for the world to see after fourth period...that's when some "sources" of my venting read it.  Now do you understand why I'm being careful with wording?  In my first draft, I included apologies to everyone I mentioned.  In the second draft, I just had fifty million "I'm sorrys" for Cory.  The third...I'm writing it on a whim.   Well I think that I need to work on my rough draft, then hit the gym around 6:30 to pound all my frustration and naivety into the crosstrainer and all my other favorites. (On a Friday?  That's real smart).  Now I'm going to go through all my entries with a fine-toothed comb and remove names...I'm leaving in all references to everyone's favorite joke, cause otherwise I'd have no journal.  Hey, if you see me at the gym and have more drama for me, by all means, tell me cause I haven't learned about any shockers lately, so the feeling of incredible stupidity is wearing off.      To Cory - I know you are probably going WHAT??? right now cause this isn't what you looked at, but that was just too mushy.  So this one's gonna be real.  Right now, there aren't enough "I'm sorry"s in the world to say how bad I feel about everything.  If I had a clue that Kim and Alex were reading this, I would have never, ever said anything (oh, yeah, Kim, if you're reading this, I'm sorry about everything that happened...if you've got the time, talk to me sometime so I can do a decent apology).  Wow, if you had told me two days ago that I would be apologizing to one of my oldest friends about a rap, I would have just shook my head and smiled, but I'm apologizing now, and I really hope you can accept it.  By the way, I'm leaving in the part about the battling, just like you suggested.  One more thing - I guess we're even, cause I kinda have to forgive you for calling me Nicholean for nine years, and I'm hoping you'll forgive and forget about this whole ugly incident. You know, I think this is the most sarcastic entry yet (other than the apologies, which I sincerely meant).  I have no apologies for what I said about Alex, cause everything I said I meant, and while I have regrets for going into so much detail (especially about Key Club), the only thing I'd change about this whole ordeal is that I would have liked to know sooner (gee thanx chemistry class, English class, math analysis, and journalism), so I could look like less of an ass, I understand why people kept the secret, cause I think that I probably would have done the same (even though I'm royally screwed, and things are going to be supremely awkward around him until graduation).  Later.

      As promised, I'm writing today...I have to to inform my loyal readers (haha yeah right) of all my exploits.  Plus, a few people who don't read all that often said they'd read more often if I wrote more often.   I'm so glad 4:20 day is over, cause the shouts of, "Four Twenty!  Celebrate the holiday" were getting old.  However, I love to hear the stoners' stories on the day after, which always begin with, "So I was about to get out the parking lot to go smoke some shitake mushrooms (my substitute for their word)."  There's an awesome story I heard, but it's really mean so I can't tell it...plus it would get a lot of people in trouble (CENSORED).  See, Tripp, I don't rat out people, even though I really dislike two people involved. Well, as usual, I'm procrastinating.  What I should be doing: studying for a history quiz, studying for a chemistry quiz, doing my rough draft, reading  A Tale of Two Cities , and doing math homework.  Quite a list.  Right now, I'm most worried about my rough draft, cause it's too long.  My research paper's supposed to have an absolute maximum of eight pages.  I'm halfway done, and I'm already at ten pages.  I wonder why...everyone else is struggling to make the minimum six pages.  I don't understand why I have to limit myself...I'm a bit long-winded (judging from the archives of ten days each lol).  If I had no restraint, I could easily go on for about twenty pages.  After all, taking over the world for dummies is no short task. I have found a new love: Big C's rhymes.  Not love for him; my sister and all her friends are in love with Cory (omg he's so hot, I wish he'd take me to the dance, there's nothing wrong with friends w/ benefits, which they don't know what that entails, omg u've got to get his lifeguarding schedule so we can know when to go to the pool, and so on).  Did I mention that my sister's 12 and we (our birthdays are a week apart...I'm older) are approaching seventeen?  Anyway, back to the rhymes.  Cory makes up these really funny rhymes about people and totally ridicules them.  There's an awesome battle going down in the intersection tomorrow between Nathan D. and Cory at seven (AM peoples).  I heard a preview of Cory's, and it's awesome.  For those who don't go to a prep school (jk it's public but packed w/ preppy ppl), it's a rap contest between two people, usually between guys, in which they pack insults into raps that are rapped in the presence of about 50 people.  Like I said, don't miss the battle cause the Nathan D. II will be awesome.   In the past two days, I've gotten a lot of inside jokes.  For the journalism girls (u know who u r) - do you really blow on it?  I always win ten fingers, which is true, I've never lost...how can I lose?  I've never had sex, done drugs, drank to the point of getting drunk, smoked anything, had a party in which the cops came, made out with a guy/girl or shoplifted anything priced more than $10.  It's always fun to play with somewhat promiscuous people, a few goody-goodys like myself, and secret bad-asses...I had no idea Jessica K.!   For Dominick, Julie Ann, Kortny, Yasmin, and all my girls C lunch odd days: It's the Titanic!  It's a submarine!  It's a tugboat.  Wait, can we go smaller?  Wait, don't look over there!  He's standing up!  Oh no, too late...she's choking on her soft cookie.  Laughing at funerals.  Ok this is the apparatus.  No the pencil is the apparatus.  Now what do we do with the apparatus?  Wiggly finger!!  *TABLE SHARING*.  Don't eat the soft cookies with the teeny chocolate chips!  What's tossed salad?  What's ridin the train?  What's a blowjob?  What's (insert term here)?  Hotdogs are Titanics.  I know I told you not to nibble the soft cookies!  Unleash the Titans!  Wait, these are little pigs-in-a-blanket...sure won't Remember  that  Titan!   Well that's about it for now.  Now go make more inside jokes!  Later.

      Well congratulations to the 60 people that got inducted to NHS, and all the officers (Bryan, Nick B., Shannon C., Lizzy H., and Erin C.) for an awesome job handling everything.  I won't list them all cause that would be one huge run-on, but I will mention the ones that read this, and my friends, and people I'm friendly with: Shaheen, Sarah A., Scott B., Kelli B., Justin B., Jherrica B., Marcus C., Edwin C., Jasmine D., Josh E., Megan F., Lindsay F., Tripp, Sarah H., Whitney H., Kevin H., Alex (yes, I am a nice person MOST of the time), Jeff J., Stacey K., Ali/Mustafa K., Reid, Sunny, Craig, Amanda (yea thanx for that awesome and *accurate* info...u too Katrina), Anne L., Lauren L., Deanna (yay you didn't catch the stage on fire!), Russell M., Julie Ann, Nikki M., Cory, me (of course!), Stacy P., Michelle R. (double congrats on the thing we were talkin about...that's great!), Joe and Mallory S. (PLEASE tell me u got the agenda for tomorrow), Lori S., Kristen T., Yasmin T. (yay!), Kim T., Katrina (see Amanda L.), Patrica T., (Mc)Kenzie, Meredith, Megan W., EJ, Stephanie H., Lee, and Matt Z.  That was one of the most awesome ceremonies I've been in (definitely kicks Ring Ceremony's butt), and a real honor.   Oh but the best part - the stories!  I'll start from the beginning.  Hey look to ur right.  No.  Seriously look to ur right.  How about u look to ur left?  You had to be there for that one...right Nikki and Cory?  Anyway, we came into what had to be Camelot - the soundtrack, and sat down.  Meanwhile, my back is killing me from sitting up so straight, so around Nick's speech on scholarship, I began to slouch.  Then I got called onstage, and I didn't know that ur supposed to shake everyone's hands, so I almost walked right past the Vice-Principal.  I finally got thru everyone's hands (I felt sooo sorry for Bryan, having to shake everyone's hands after all those other hands...eww imagine all those germs from everyone), and went to light my candle.  The trouble was, I didn't have one of those new candles, so the wick was really short.  That meant my candle wouldn't stay lit.  First, it went out while shaking Shannon's hand, so I bummed a light from Cory.  That one went out too, so I went to Stacy P., and THAT one almost went out too!  I could see my mom mouthing something, and after the ceremony, she told me what she said: watch out!  Apparently, I almost lit Cory (who was standing next to me), Stacy, my boobs, my shirt, and my skirt on fire.  Anne L. and Julie Ann almost had their hair lit on fire, and Michael F. almost lit Josh E.'s crotch on fire.  Needless to say, don't trust the best and brightest of the Class of 2005 with fire.  So, after the ceremony, we went to get some drinks.  Man, that punch gave me a huge headache!  What was in it?  Also, something embarrassing and truly frightening happened in the length of ten minutes.  I went up to Anne to congratulate her (by the way, her dress was absolutely adorable), and her bf reminded me of someone, but I couldn't think of who.  So I said, "You remind me of someone, but I can't think of who."  "Patrick V.H.?" he asked.  "Yeah!" I exclaimed.  "That would be because we're brothers."  Yeah, that was awkward, so I basically just said something like nice meeting...bye.  Patrick got a kick out of it in 6th today...haha the ashen one!  And now for the frightening one - I was walking to the door, when something about yay high (motions to my chest) hit me, and I look down, and it's a mini-me of Alex!  Wow that's scary...I love Austin Powers, especially The Spy Who Shagged Me, but it's just frightening in real life.  Just imagine someone 1/8 of his height.  LOL!  Ok, that was a bit mean...sorry.   So it's basically downhill as far as being busy, until Saturday.  Tomorrow's the editorial board meeting for newspaper, and I'm leading it for the first time.  I'm a bit nervous about it.  This reminder goes out to Joe S., Mallory S., Mary S., Brynne, Sarah A., Alex I., Yasmin, Greg G., Brittany V., Alex F., Cory N., Summer F., Amanda P., Matt F., Karlin, and all the other people I forgot: remember to be there at 6:45 AM.  Yes, u read right - 6:45 AM!  Please be there if you can, cause it's important for yall to get used to voicing opinions (not like some of u need the practice) and just sitting in on newspaper functions.  There's a lot to talk about tomorrow, but usually we just sit around, staring at each other and eating donuts.   I talked with Boswell today, about how to raise the research paper grade, and do u kno what she said?  She reiterated, almost VERBATIM, what Alex said to me about how to make my paper better.  Even the comments are about the same.  So I guess that paid off somehow. Well I gotta cut this one short, cause my sister needs to get on for homework.  To Mallory: PLEASE remember to forward that thing to Joe!  To Joe: PLEASE remember to check ur e-mail!  To everyone else: good night.  To Alex: thanks.

      If you talked to me after fourth period, chances r u were giggling...I got a huge paper cut on my tongue (I have two pieces of ice in my mouth rite now), so I sounded like a lil fruit when I talked cause my tongue was swollen.  I was in the journalism room after school, and Mallory came in, and the Gill told her that I had a papercut on my tongue, and that I'm tryin not to talk.  So she starts laughing, and asks if thats why I didn't ask ne questions in Boswell's class.  So I nodded; "So why aren't u talking then," she asked.  "Cuh I talh lie thith [Cause I talk like this]."  EVERYONE started CRACKING UP.  BTW, in case ur wondering why there's a papercut on my tongue, heres the story.  I volunteered to head up the Quill and Scroll mailer, which basically tells evry1 that they got in (to the juniors, congrats Mallory, Yasmin, Zach, Brittany B. AKA BRITTNAY, Greg G., Katie J., and that other junior who got in).  What that involves - a whole lot of licking envelopes and folding paper into thirds.  So I was almost finished when SOMEONE's letter edge cut my tongue.  Stupid Alex. I believe that everyone has definite strengths and weaknesses.  Cause my strengths r too numerous to mention (jk), I'll keep it to two things I'm really bad at - swimming fast, and doin any math problems related to geometry.  First the swimming thing - if you ever see me at the Y swimming rele slow, don't make fun, cause I'm prolly doin laps lol.  It's a bit embarrassing, but my eleven year old sister beats me almost every time, unless I cheat.  Second, I'm terrible w/ geometry, as I said before.  Why do u think my PSAT score is kinda low (1220)?  I'm probably gonna spend most of tonite reviewing geometry for the SAT tomorrow.  I'm not all that nervous but I want to make at least a 1250, which means I need to seriously raise my math score.  I had a 560 on my PSAT, and I want at least a 600 (assuming my English is relatively close to my PSAT score, I'll have a 1260).  If I study a lil bit tonite, eat a good breakfast and sniff sum special aroma to relax me (no u stupid potheads not that kind of aroma...lavender), I should get at least 10 points higher.  As long as I'm above 1200, I'll be somewhat happy. Speaking of happy, I was sooooo happy in Math Analysis (I was actually sayin to myself I'm happy, I'm happy, which must have pissed off Shaheen, Monique, Michael, and all the other ppl that sit next to me).  I can't say why tho, cuz it will REALLY piss off someone who told me this with the hope that I won't pass it on.  But still, I'm happy, I'm happy... Well since I can talk again, and my tongue has cooled off, I'm gonna leave it at here.  I'll end this one with an extremely funny quote from the Gill - "She was licking his..." - she meant to say envelope, but couldn't remember what, so it sounded dirty.  lol.  One more thing...I was previewing the entry for typos, and I clicked on my friend's name Yasmin...yeah Yasmin is a form of birth control.  Later.

      That's actually from the book we're reading in English class, A Tale of Two Cities, lol...yea i have to read 100 pages this weekend to catch up from Book 2, chapter 17 to Book 3, chapter 3.  But that's not what I want to talk about.  I have been thinking about butterflies, why nice girls like mean boys, why this is an awesome week, yet bittersweet (hence, the title), and where these outlandish rumors are coming from! First things first - my awesome yet bittersweet week.  If it weren't for the butterflies (see paragraph below - only Shaheen and Kortny truly know what butterflies are...don't even try to make sense of that), the Gill moving (see last entry...happy and sad tears), and the rumors (see paragraph below butterflies), this would be the BEST week of my life.  This is definitely in the top five though.  First, on Wednesday, I got my dream job as managing editor for newspaper.  I was actually looking at the chain of rule, and I preside over one of my best friends.  How weird is that?  It's like bein friends w/ ur employees.  But I do get to "supervise" section leaders (oh yeah, if u kno who the section leaders are for newspaper, you definitely know why I'm happy about this authority).  But enough about newspaper...u kno I wonder if Joe saw what I said last night, cause I might have given him inspiration.  Plus, I take the SATs on Saturday (the sooner u take em, the sooner u find out which colleges u have a chance w/), and then my church picnic's on Sunday, the 25th anniversary.  Yay! Anyway, then today I found out that I got inducted into NHS!!!!!!!  That's like my high school goal.  As Jasmine D. says, "that's kinda sad."  Most ppl want to get laid in high school, but I want to get into NHS.  At least my goal betters humanity, cause I'll be able to volunteer my services, and raise the collective GPA of the people I tutor.  I don't really understand the admissions process, cause some people who really deserved to get in (ZG, CB) didn't, and some people who really shouldn't have got in did.  But such is life. Wow, did u kno that prom's only nine days away, and after-prom's only ten?  I can't wait till we get to decorate for Prom...I've watched Las Vegas, the OC (they went to Vegas), and Will and Grace (Karen's wedding is in Vegas) to gather inspiration.  It's gonna be soooo much fun!  Even with all the silly rumors about reputed prom dates, I'm still looking forward to it, even though I'm NOT GOING (see  that  Ellen B. and Kristin C.).   What do you think of butterflies?  Do you think they mean anything?  There's two theories on butterflies out there, one from Shaheen, and one from Emily T. ...since they both gross me out, especially Emily's, just IM me if u want to know (TDMonMon875)...well now i guess i have to alter my profile ;) .  As Forrest Gump says (which I watched in 3rd period, and is one of the best movies of all time), "that's all I have to say about that." Ok, theres definitely someone out there that I pissed off.  Was it something I said?  At any rate, now the rumors say me and Alex are going on a SECOND date, which AGAIN IS NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!  I have three points on why it possibly cannot be true: (1). He has a girlfriend...so that fact alone eliminates that possibility, and I'm not some low ho (haha that rhymes) that does that kind of thing...I think couples, especially those types that hold hands and kiss, not make out, at classroom doors, and hug in the hallways, and shout I love you and don't care who hears them, are so cute (I have no clue if they're like that, I'm just saying that I think couples are adorable, as long as they don't show their love in a way that makes me wish I hadn't eaten anything that day); (2). I haven't seen a movie since February, cause nothing good has been out...u can ask one of three people that went with me if u don't believe me...I do want to go see Mean Girls, Troy, 13 Going on 30, Envy, and Godsend, so I prolly will be at the movies a lot in the future, but not with him; and (3). Other than a few things that have come up in "table chats" from first grade, which sooo don't count, plus of course kissing my family goodbye and goodnight, I've never had a serious, knock-you-off-your-feet kiss, and I certainly wouldn't waste it on someone I don't even like (right DKL, KDQ, ALB, ANB, JAEM, XO, YT, SA, BB, all the chem girls and all the other people who know why exactly I'm snickering...don't worry, I'm being totally honest about this, really I am). U kno, while I was doin my pool laps at the Y (which is one of the most refreshing parts of my day...you should try it), I was thinking, why do nice girls go for mean guys?  I can think of two such girls off the top of my head, and could prolly come up w/ a lot more.  I don't understand it.  If everyone says ur bf's am (insert mean word here that I can't say cause I mentioned church in this entry and I can't say Jesus Christ and the word I'm thinking of in the same entry), why wouldn't u believe them?  I would definitely take my friends' and family's word over a bf neday.  Then again, I've never been in a really really serious relationship, so what do I know.  These girls are sooo pretty too, so that rules out the old he-asked-me-and-I'm-never-gonna-get-anything-better-so-I-might-as-well-settle-for-what-I-can-get excuse, which is the longest hyphenated statement (random fact: the longest word is 1,913 letters...it's the name of a chemical posted in the Davis's room).   Well I'm getting tired and I can't wait for Math Analysis to see who got in in that class.  Later.

      Bart: Hey beat it immigrants country's full.  Go back to where u came from! Boat skipper: Ok u heard him.  Get back into the hole and go to Canada. Guess I should explain, especially to math analysis, why I was crying and smiling at the same time!  Well some of those tears r happy tears, cause I've got my dream editor position...managing editor for newspaper!  I've wanted that since freshman year, so I couldn't be happier about that.  Plus, the people I'm workin under are Joe S. and Mallory S. (no, they're not related)...although Joe's gonna be like, "Nichole, go get me a drink, some food" (u get the point) the entire year.  Plus, it's gonna be fun to work w/ Mallory, especially after those *table sharing* moments in chem.  What's even more awesome is that Summer F. is replacing me, and I honestly can't think of a better candidate for the job...I would totally trust her with anything money related, so training her will be a breeze.  Speaking of training, Aaron L.'s training me, which should be interesting Well it sounds like one of the best days of my life...why the heck would I be sad?  I'll tell u why...my beloved O'Gilliam (AKA Mrs Gill) is leaving at the end of this year!!  That's awful! It actually made me cry...ok so I'm a bit weepy sometimes, ok i cry more than most ppl, but still.  Well The Simpsons is on, so I'll leave it at this.  Later.

      I don't think I stopped laughing for almost the entire day.  Well of course, having a five person "study group" for the chem test wasnt fun, but otherwise... So, there's three excellent things that are making me laugh.   First, as some of you may not know, my mom has pinkeye, which is awesome for me.  Other than the fact that she has to throw away all my makeup (which sux), there isn't really a downside for me.  She picked me up today, then we went to Mickey D's and got ice cream (I'll prolly be at the gym for awhile tonite workin off that one).  She was talkin to my grandfather today (Papa...don't tell me u call urs grandfather, cause if u say u do ur a freakin liar), and he believes in some offbeat old people things; for example, he believes George Washington died not of pneumonia, but of syphillis.  So my mom wanted to hear his theory on pinkeye, and he said that you can give it to ppl by looking at them.  Wow, if I had pinkeye and I could give it to anyone by looking at them, then I could be some kind of superhero! The second - I borrowed the Carver yearbook for sixth grade, and sum ppl look so different!  Some ppl have rele slimmed down, and I was so surprised at how many ppl wore glasses!  There's sum ppl who braces and glasses did them good!  I believe that the purpose of middle school is to hide the ugly period between childhood cuteness and high school hot.  Some people were already cute tho in middle school so it kinda disproves my theory, especially the cute ones that got ugly. Well I gotta go to Ukrops to help Ashley pick out a cake, so I'll just havta leave u in suspense about one of the funniest things I've ever heard.  I promise i'll actually add on this time (i was too tired last nite...my sister didn't get offline till 11). Alrite I'm back from Ukrops.  Ashley and I felt rele stupid cause we didn't bring our Ukrops cards and then one of the ppl told me that u don't have to have it neway.  Oops.   Ok kids, I'm gonna tell u this once - don't believe everything u hear.  Apparently, according to the rumor mill that my chem class told me about (I learn the most interesting things from those ppl), me and alex went on a date together over the weekend to the movies, and afterwards we kissed.  Uh yeah right!  I think that's hilarious that someone would actually BELIEVE that (sorry Jasmine D., Katie J., Shawn G., Kevin H., and all the other chem ppl that believed it).  So if you've heard it, PLEASE do not come up to me and ask me if he's a good kisser, cause I don't know and frankly don't want to find out.  Five ppl have already asked me, so its getting annoying.  I'd actually like to know who started it...I know Shawn knows, but he won't tell me.  I feel sorry for the sad person who thought we were in any way attracted to each other.  To review and clarify - numero uno: I have never been on a date w/ alex, and don't plan to anytime soon.  Numero dos: I have absolutely no feelings for my "supposed" date...which did not happen.  Numero tres: I have no idea if he's a good kisser, so quit asking me! Well my mascara's smearing from rubbing my eyes (the pollen's killin me), so I'll keep it to these three.  Later.

      The good news - I FINALLY finished my paper.  The bad news - my mom has pinkeye.  The good news - I have a ride for the next week.  Yay!  At dinner today, I thought I had killed my mom.  There was this guy at the gym, and he grunts like he's screwing when he lifts weights.  My mom had just eaten a biscuit, and her eyes just popped way out, she starts turning purple, and it occurs to me after thirty seconds of this, OMG she's choking!!  WTF do I do?  I couldn't remember if you're supposed to do the heimlich below the ribs or at the abdomen.  But it's all good, she just straightened herself up.   So moving on, I just saw that hot chick movie for the first time, and let me tell u, it's hilarious (to borrow a line from Joel W.).  U kno that boy from Mrs. Doubtfire, the adorable little middle kid whose bday ends up bein the last straw between Sally Fields and Robin Williams' characters?  Whoa, he got HOT!!!!  WOW!  The movie itself is great, but the boy?  Again, to quote Monica from Friends (Courteney Cox Arquette)..."Huminah huminah huminah!"   Well my sister's looking over my shoulder, so I cant say too much.  Right now I'm relaying what my dad wants to say to my cousin, trying to keep it G-rated.  Thank God they're gone.  Now to the stuff I actually wanna talk about.  I learned an interesting quote from Shaheen, but since she procrastinated, I have to get it off her away message: ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." [Albert Einstein]"  To translate that into my life, I should be nice to people, but not too nice cause then I'd just be fakey and too sweet.  Well I gotta cut this one short cause I gotta go in five minutes.  I'll add more later, some good stories so check it out in about three hours.  Later for now.

      I've always loved the name Hannah, but I don't want Hannah to become another Ashley (no offense to all the Ashleys out there, my best friend's name is Ashley).  Aah, that reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Bart and Lisa are in the same class, and the teacher's handing out papers, and she says something like, "Ashley, Dakota, Ashley, Ashley, Jacob, Dakota, Jacob, Ashley, Jacob, Dakota, oh, and Bart and Lisa."  I have a long list of names that I really like.  For example, I would like to name a girl Elyse (pronounced Elise) Renee.  I also like Lisetta James (cause when u think about it, James is really a unisex name...if Rachel Griffiths can name her baby Banjo, I can give my girl a middle name of James), Chloe Nicole (not Nichole, cause I've always hated that h in my name, pigheaded people say Nie-hole), Sophia Anne, Savannah Elizabeth, and Alexia Faith...my mom's name has its roots in Alexander, so I definitely want to name one of my girls some form of that, but I could not bear to burden one of my daughters with the name Sandra...maybe Sandrine Rose :).  As one can tell, I'm crossing my fingers for girls, but if I do get boys, I like Brendan James (especially if Brendan and Lisetta are twins), Ethan Cole, Brett Chase, Jackson Drew, Hunter Mason (and dare I say it for the backlash and teasing to edure till my 30th class reunion) Alex Scott.  I absolutely love the  name  Alexander, but I don't particularly care for the people I've met named Alex - shocker.  Other than the one I mention most, I don't like a boy Alex cause he talks too much to make himself look better, a girl Alex cause she's a spoiled brat, and another boy who's just annoying.  I do actually like two people named Alex - Alex B., cause she's one of the most interesting people I've ever met, and Alexa H. (ok so it's one letter off - same difference), cause she's really sweet and opinionated at the same time.  Actually, I hated the name Amanda until I met Amanda L., and I really didn't like Brittany until ninth grade...revenge of the Brittanys, in which I met both Brittany B. and Brittney B., and some other Brittany people at Bird.  Can you tell I'm procrastinating so I don't have to write my paper - which isn't too smart cause it's due first thing monday, and I have a lot more to go.  Well I'm going to have to end this one here, even though I have more to say, so I can finish this paper I've dragged out for two weeks.  Later.

      Wednesday, May 5, 10:00 PM Unless one lives in Bali or some other remote corner of the earth, one would not argue when I say I'm an emotional person.  I cry very easily, except when I'm supposed to cry (weddings, funerals, etc.).  In fact, I'm crying right now, cause I just finished The O.C [well at least I wasn't the only one crying...Kenzie said she was too...so there].  Oh God, I'm going to flood the house tomorrow night with Friends.  In the past two weeks ALONE, I've cried over an argument w/ my mom, Gill leaving, a Friends commercial, another commercial (except I laughed until I cried), Jamaican Jews (laughed until I cried...inside joke, don't even try to understand it), The O.C., and the thought of the Class of 2004 graduating.  Wow, that's about every other day!  On the flipside, I get happy really easily - for the entirety of last week, I was happy over getting a newspaper position, being in NHS, and something else that's between me, Katrina and Amanda L.  For example, my sister and I went to the mall to get Mother's Day presents, and I went nuts over the Four Seasons having a lemon scented candle that really did smell like Lemon Zest.  My mother's day present will be awesome - I really freaked her out b/c I came home w/ two Victoria's Secret bags and told her we bought her something for others to enjoy too.  Haha, we bought lotion in Sweet Temptation (other will enjoy the scent).  I also got her tootsie rolls, chocolate/white chocolate covered pretzels, jelly bellies, Reese's pieces; skin conditioner in Sweet Pea (Bath and Body Works), moisturizing soap in Plumeria (" " " "); a berry burst candle from Kirklands that smells just like honeydew and watermelon; four tart-shaped candles from Four Seasons (it's a Yankee Candle store) in Plumeria, Lemon Zest, Juicy Grapefruit, and Chocolate Chip Cookie, plus a bigger candle in lilac breeze that smells just like lilac.  I still want to get her some Hershey's kisses and Altoids.   I believe the embarrassment department is working triple overtime to amuse others with my accidental antics.  Just TODAY, I had two embarrassing and one not-so embarrassing moment (actually more gross than embarrassing).  First was in chem.  To defend myself, at the time I had had less than 18 hours of sleep in three days (28 to date, five days), far fewer than my minimal 8.5 per night.  So, anyway, I was really bored in chemistry, so I started doodling on my left arm (I’m right-handed).  It was quite a work of art, if I do say so myself - there were/was a watch, smiley, mini drawings on my knuckles (a rose, a sun, a peace sign, a heart and a Star of David), and some other stuff on my fingers.  Then I got tired.  The result - I slept through half of chemistry.  I awoke to a beard of silver and blue ink courtesy of my sketches, and a big puddle of drool.  Thank God I got it off before Boswell’s study session (by the way, the test was soooo easy).  The second one happened at the mall, when my sister dragged me away from this beautiful shell necklace with pink beads, and Mike M. saw me. (who wears the pants in our family?).  Third, my sister and I were in Victoria’s Secret, debating whether to buy stimulating body scrub in Vanilla Lace, when I, AS A JOKE, hold up one of the more *skimpy* selections.  My grandmother walks in before I can say anything, and offers to BUY them for me!  I’m not completely sure if she believed me when I said I was kidding. Well, I’ll leave you with two quotes.  Since one is from Bubba G., one’s kinda stupid, but slightly amusing: “Man who runs in front of car gets tired, but man who runs behind car gets exhausted,” and “Opinions are like butt holes - everyone has them.”  The second is courtesy of my mom, and it basically means don’t share ur opinion constantly…got it (u know who u r, the people this is directed to).  I need to go find more tissues.  Later.  Thursday, May 6, 10:15 PM Between The O.C. and Friends, I’ve gone through half a roll of toilet paper, five cups of water to rehydrate, half a bottle of Visine Tears (my eyes get dry after wiping them so much), and three applications of mascara.  I couldn’t even make it to the series finale on Friends - I started crying right at 8:50.  Again, happy tears mingled with sad tears, as the babies were born (“Wow, they have my name!”), the moving, the duck and chick, the foosball table, the plane, Ross having his heart broken just to have it mended when Rachel showed up…it’s the end of an era in great television.  I’m going to miss it sooo much! It’s going to be hard to stay up till 1AM to see Friends on Jay Leno, then Brad Pitt on Conan.  I’m incredibly drained from all that crying, and just from being tired (didn’t fall asleep today though…go me).  This weekend will be worse, cause I have to rewrite my rough draft to eliminate all the stuff about taking over the world, and just analyze why the Party was able to reign effectively over the world (all the fun stuff is going).   For the second time, I'm trying to watch my mouth.  I had a terrible cursing problem in seventh grade, and then I got myself to stop, but lately, it's been creeping back into my vocabulary.  I started a barrage over the thought that I might have lost my Tale of Two Cities study guide and wouldn't be able to make more copies for 3rd and 7th tomorrow.  Wow, how things have changed...I used to pop Dominique on the hand for saying dammit, but now she gives the "the look" and "the point" and the "ur goin to hades" mouthing.  So, if I get upset and start going, jus tell me to shut up (no, Will Cu., that does not give you license to say it to me even more now in the name of "helping" me).  I read something about attaching a rubber band to your wrist, and smacking yourself with it every time you regress, so that you associate pain with the undesirable habit.  Got rubber bands? I may actually have a prom date…my camera.  I might go w/ Mr. Young to take pictures.  It could be cute.  The camera can have a little tissue boutonnière, I could get a nice dress, play some quality blackjack, and still get a few dances in.  However, I’ve been so insistent about not going that I may seem even more spineless if I give in.  Still, I would love to get all dolled up, with the great makeup, bubblegum pink nails, a fancy up-do, the works.  No, I’m not going…definitely not, I’m white as all get out.  Well if I don’t wear a revealing dress…no, no a non-revealing prom dress is an oxymoron.  But it would be nice to maybe get a few dances in.  I’ll keep you posted.  Till I actually make a decision…Later.

      She's gone: that happy, euphoric even, girl who hummed happy songs under her breath; who murmured I'm happy, I'm happy to herself; who was nice to just about everyone, even people she didn't particularly like.  She's caught the last bus out of town.  Which means the sarcastic, worrying, not as nice me is back.  What the heck happened?  Two things - (1). My pimp hat was ruined, and (2). Someone broke my retainer. Ok, why the heck would u have a pimp hat?  It was to go with my pimp car.  My mom WAS gonna give me her old car, the ultimate old person car - a Buick Century. (Until she finds out about my retainer, which can never ever happen...do you kno if superglue's toxic?)  Of course, I get it when I get a job and can pay car insurance.  So one day I won these cute blue leopard-spotted dice at putt-putt, and my mom said that I couldn't brotherfy her car...wait till u get ur own.  I took her for her word on that one.  So I'm gonna brotherfy my car and make it a right pimpmobile.  Of course I'm gettin the pimped out seat covers, a purple steering wheel (maybe with a horn tune of Big Pimpin), and of course the dice.  I may even get it painted some whack color of blue, and put a little feather on the antenna.  So today I was at our church picnic (what an odd place for planning a pimpmobile), and I saw a clown making balloon animals and jewelry.  Being the clever and cheap person I am, I thought to myself, "I wonder if I can save some money by getting this clown to make a purple pimp hat with a pink balloon portruding to look like a feather."  I told the clown I wanted a hat with a thing stickin out, and the clown made a version of what I wanted.  As soon as I got it on my head, a gust came and blew it into the grass and it popped.   Then, to make matters worse, I went to go check on my retainer, which I had in my seat, and I found it.  It was on the ground, the top part snapped in HALF.  Right now, I've got gum holding it together, but I need a replacement ASAP.  The problem is, it would cost $125 to get a replacement if my orthodontist can't glue it back together.  I have exactly $125 in my account at the bank.  No problem, right?  WRONG!  I haven't gotten my mom anything for Mother's Day yet, so if I get it replaced, I can't get my mom anything for Mother's Day.  If I don't, and my mom finds out, I'll be dead by Mother's Day.  It's a real Catch-22.  The worst one - I get it replaced, borrow the money, and my mom finds out I borrowed money so I could get her a Mother's Day present.  So no matter what happens, I'm screwed.  Well I might as well think of a pimp name while I'm pondering exactly how my mom's gonna kill me (strangulation, whack me w/ a shovel, the works).  If you have ANY ideas at all, PLEASE IM me and tell me (tdmonmon875), cause frankly I'll take any suggestions that keep me from going to heaven at 16.  Later.

      I'm a little weirdo.  Seriously, I am.  For instance, my dad and I rolled up into 7-11 to get a slurpee, and we started pointing out cars that we think are hot, beautiful, pretty, ok or ugly for the entire trip home, about three miles.  I'm quite partial to Honda, Toyota, Pontiac, Buick, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Jeep (my sister's in love with those box jeeps...she wants one in green, but I said to get it in blue cause they're prettier in blue), Volkswagen (still hopin for a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible in either red, blue, white, or silver), Acura, BMW, and Rolls Royce.  There was an awesome one that someone got as a limo for Prom...I actually have a picture of it.  Speaking of which, I need to tell my sister to get that cute sunset in Hawaii photo album at Old Navy for my birthday, cause I want to bring a bunch of disposable cameras to school the last few days, and take lots of pictures.  Wow, I really switch topics easily. Speaking of switching topics, I had a deep thought today.  Everyone has obsessions.  It occurred to me while I was reading Shaheen's thing about cherry tomatoes (I think all tomatoes are disgusting btw).  Lets see, I have a big thing about my breath smelling good (no Julie Ann, not drawing pictures with the steam from my breath), my eyes looking big (I think I squint too much, but nowhere near as much as Renee Zellweger...no matter what everyone else says, I still think that George Clooney does not squint often), my hair, getting the blush right and my teeth looking white.  Basically, my face.  That really says something.  Well, there's a few more, but let's not get into that... I also just realized that I hate a LOT of things.  Wow, we could be here all night if I went into that.  The two things that annoy me most, though, are animal hating/rude/conceited/slow moving (with the exception of young children, the disabled, and the elderly)/obnoxious/exceedingly impatient (stress on exceedingly, because I'm extremely impatient)/know-it-all/blase/snotty/easily annoyed people (not all apply, however...any of these annoy me), and overplayed songs.  Well my dad's pestering me to get offline, so I'll leave it at this.  Later.

      Wow, despite the suckiness of the past week, I really have had a semi-good day.  Three good things happened to me today, and three bad things happened.  First, the bad - I lost my mom’s GENUINE pearl earring.  Brittnay (Brittany B. for all those outside yearbook) has the other one in her pocket.  Well, I’ll use one of the good things that happened today to take care of that.  Second, my mom found out about my interim.  America, if my mom’s reaction were a bomb explosion, we would be experiencing nuclear fallout in Hiroshima right now.  And that’s the reaction I got because she thinks my math analysis grade is a D.  I believe human life would cease to exist if she knew I was failing.  The third: I just accidentally deleted all my computer games and my computer calculator, AND my painting tools.  This is a tragedy almost incurable by the three good things that happened today - Quill and Scroll, Shoney’s and something between me n sum1 else that’s almost better than the first two combined.  Suppose you’re wondering…why Shoney’s?  Well, I got a job there, after two months of searching.  I’m starting Monday as a hostess and cashier.  Even if the wage is $5.15 an hour, and I work two weekend shifts, I will still get $103 (before taxes…after it’s about $61.80) every two weeks.  That’s mostly going towards replacement earrings for my mom (I cannot fathom her reaction to two blows within one weekend).   Well, Jay’s opening monologue’s coming up in a few minutes, so I’ll keep it short.  I’m lovin a host of songs, like: -I miss you - Blink-182 -Love’s divine - Seal -Touched by an angel - Celine Dion (“Let the rain come down and wash away my tears”) -Leave (Get out) - Jo Jo -Take my breath away - Jessica Simpson -Extraordinary - Liz Phair -My band - D12 -Dirt off your shoulder - Jay-Z (the Edwin renditions in Math Analysis don‘t count lol) -My immortal - Evanescence (yes, I still love it, mostly because of Friends) -The reason - Hoobastank One more thing I forgot to add to my bad and good list.  The bad - I saved my semi-final draft on my computer, and it lost my draft this morning.  I had to take my first tardy since first grade to retype it.  The good - I took it to Boswell, and she said that if I make the changes that she suggests, I should have an A, and that it’s 100 times better than it was before.  I still want one of the best freakin editors to look over it though, cause the comments were really, really helpful.   Did you know that, now, you can comment on my blog entries?  I was reading Shaheen's blog and discovered this.  Of course, eblogger will not be perfected until it has a counter and a list of screen names that visit.  Imagine the fun...do I hear an evil plan Dominique? Sorry, but between my cat’s fear of fans (u have no idea what fun it is to blow it on her and see her reaction) and Jay, le blog can’t compete.  I’ll leave you with a few quips from Jay (these may not be word for word):  “You don’t read the newspapers, you don’t know what’s going on in the world.  It’s like being President Bush [in reference to being in Las Vegas.” -Jay Leno “John Kerry once went to a concert with Courtney Love.  And he’s questioning Bush’s judgement?” -Jay Leno “According to Michael Jackson, he wants Janet Jackson to marry at Neverland Ranch.  The only people who have objections, in fact, are the parents of the ring bearer.” -Jay Leno

      That, btw, is a Homer quote...haven't had one in awhile.  Of course, it's the best Simpsons of all time - the Marijuana episode.  I'm not sure if au is spelled right, tho.  I jus got back from my funk class w/ my mom (nice to see u there jordan - note the sarcasm), and that was, hands down, THE most fun I've had working out.  Miranda, Marcela and I will probably have  Step in the name of love  in our heads tomorrow (that was the cooldown song).  It was a great calf workout; I'm really glad it didn't focus on abs, cuz they're STILL sore from my Pilates on the Ball class from yesterday.  My benefits have paid off though - I'm swimming a fraction faster, and I feel a bit better.  Wonder if it can curb my weird dreams, like the one i had in chemistry on Friday, and the one i had last night. I met the person who might take Gill's place next year - well, one of the applicants.  She was a bit short, quiet, friendly...that works.  Mrs. Gates and I showed her the journalism room, the news room, answered some basic questions, all that jazz.  I probably should have given her a yearbook, and outlined all the editors on staff.  Wow, I really am weird. I really need to go study for my math analysis quiz.  Either way though, I get a really, really low grade on interim.  I'll leave you with this: Why do people lie?  I usually lie to people I like more than people I'm friendly with, and I lie almost constantly to people I dislike.  Why is that.  While you ponder one of my deep questions, I'll ponder why I cannot understand trigonometry as a whole.  So weird.  Later

      To Julie Ann and Bethany - This is one awesome view!  So don't look alike!  Stupid pansies that can't take the heat...favorite pansy...What's my favorite pansy?  Purple pansies! To Dominique - Don't you take that picture!  I said not to take the picture!  We care for Care Bears!  Hotdogs with chilli.  Waking up *seatmates* to and from.  Ooh, souveniers!  I want that pimp hat (still goin this summer to buy a pimp hat rite?) In case you're scratching your head ("Must be a nice vacation for his balls" - Jennifer Coolidge, Legally Blonde), those are just some jokes from Kings Dominion trip with Math Analysis.  I must say, even though we didn't ride very many rides due to the long lines and muggy heat, I still had fun!  I basically hung out with Dominique, Julie Ann, Jennifer P., Paul, Bethany, Dominique and Carmen.  Tip: Don't try to be a cheapass and take a picture of your friends on the log ride, because 1). You will end up taking a picture of someone else's trip down, and 2). The picture will not turn out.  The bus rides were fun too.  I learned about Catholicism from Chandos, Mustafa and Alex, and I finished  Catcher in the Rye .  That was a good book, but I wasn't all that fond of the ending.  I can't forget the pancake breakfast either.  There, I found out that even though I suck at flipping pancakes at home, I'm really good in my math class.  I learned about horsepower too (apparently, corvette engines are really good).  There are some great pictures of both of the events too.  I do wish I had gotten that picture of Nathan (or Matt, can't remember which), flipping a pancake up into the air, with me trying to catch it on a plate.  Initially, I had it, but it flopped off the plate.  Luckily, Bobby caught it before it hit the floor.  I'll have to get those pictures developed soon, but first I'll have to finish off the pictures on the white camera.  I think bringing it to chemistry one day will accomplish that. Thursday night at work wasn't so good.  My trainer was mad at me (you can always tell just how mad she is by the force with which she sets stuff down, and the plastic containers were bouncing on the countertops), and I was really drained and worried about finishing my paper on the History of Trigonometry (aka busy work).  I was really down and about to scream, when, while carrying dirty dishes to the kitchen to be washed, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" comes on the radio.  That's one of Shaheen's favorite songs.  It was like she was there (even though she's in Bataar or some Middle Eastern country), just saying something like, "It's ok poppet, only two hours to go."  I'm sure she would have said something more intelligent though.  Anyway, that just instantly cheered me up (plus, the song really is beautiful).  That, and the calculation I got when I tabulated how much money I would make on my first paycheck.  Too bad my dad told me that I calculated one week too many, and my paycheck is back to being nowhere near enough.  I suppose I'll be chillin at CRA in my spare time instead of chillin at the mall.   I need to finish my Vice President speech for NHS, so I'll end it with this (provided from the senior surveys I was browsing through from the You Had To Be There Reflector...that's sophomore year for the class of 2004, and freshman year for class of 2005): "I shall miss these things when it all rolls by" -DMB, from Joe B.'s quote, and "Anyone can catch your eye, but it takes someone special to catch your heart" -DMB, from Lauren J.'s quote.  Later.

      Just a reminder to self: I am  not  Penelope Cruz.  Today, at break (durin SOLs we don't have lunch), I bought myself a coke, and it was about a minute before we had to leave.  I realize this while I'm talkin to Shannon L., and I attempted to guzzle the drink, hoping it runs in the family (seriously, my dad can gulp down a 16 oz in one breath).  I'm about a third of the way through, and my eyes are watering...I'm about ready to spit it out cause it burns sooo bad.  Luckily, I didn't, especially since I was standing near someone who I really didn't want to spit all over, plus a bunch of people in my chemistry class who would be a tad pissed if I spit coke on them.  Never doin that again. Found a few more pictures, but I forgot to upload them...theres a cute one of my cousin and her date almost kissing (pause for a collective awwww).  Can't wait till tomorrow and Friday.  That reminds me, I have English hw (like Hamlet, hate Boswell's assignments on them). Thank goodness that SOLs are over.  History and English were "ridiculously easy," to quote Julie Ann, but the chemistry was really really hard.  I'm just hoping that I passed.  It's funny, cause I managed at least a teensy bit of studying (in the form of, "Ashley, quick, call these to me" like two seconds before the test started in History) for History and English, but the one I needed to study for, Chemistry, I did absolutely no studying for.  What the hell is the empirical formula, and why the hell will I need to know it in the real world?  While we're on what the hell type sentences, what the hell is the Nisei, the Bataan Death March [yea Shaheen thanx for tellin me it's in the middle east...it's right around the Philippines (update: she was talking about Bataar, not Bataan)].  Another thing, why the hell do we need to know Jonas Salk?  If that's what keeps me from a perfect score or close to a perfect score in History, I'm gonna be pissed (or keeping with the hell theme, mad as hell). On a totally unrelated topic, I believe shivers are the best way to gauge how good something is.  I don't mean those grossed out shivers, or shivers from being cold, or some kind of weird dance thing.  I mean those shivers u get at the end of a terrific song, or a stunning movie, or a powerful TV show.  For example, I was listening to country on the way home, and I heard that song "Don't take the girl" (dunno who sings it), and I was shivering like mad, even though the car said it was like 80 degrees outside.  I still shiver when I hear little Jenny's voice on Forrest Gump ("he's my Jennae," rite Ashley and Monica...don't worry about it, its not sum1 I like).  I think the best shivers are the ones you get when ur lookin rite at some1 special, especially rite in the eyes, and he's glancing right back at u (again dont worry bout it no1 i like rite now no matter what u say). Well I g2g...suppose I should explain the title.  My stomach hurts...stupid Jennae (my sister Jennifer).  Later.

      Nichole O. is no more.  She's dead, gone.  When I'm at Shoney's, I'm Nichole R.  Why?  My manager and I were looking over the list of workers, and I pointed out one in particular.  I asked if I was supposed to work tomorrow 5-10, and she said no.  She then explained that there was another Nichole, Nichole O.  "So what's your last name initial?"  "O."  So yea, I'm Nichole R. (the R.'s for Renee...although it might have been fun to be...I got nothin, bein NO is fun).  I had my first day of work, hence the title.  I worked salad bar and hostessing, in addition to making a few things, like part of my dinner.  I'm definitely gonna use my first paycheck to buy myself a pair of insoles.  I think I'm gonna die on Sunday - 3 until 9.  Such estacy.  At least I'll get more for my paycheck.  Sadly, however, after taxes,  $30 for car insurance, $15 to pay back Amber and Ashley for all the times I've gotten rides, and $8.20 for those "gellin like a felon" insoles, I've got about $17.  That will be enough to buy me...absolutely nothing I wanted to buy, except maybe developing fees for the cameras.  So much for blowing my first paycheck. Hope yall got a chance to look at those prom pics...I'll prolly add a few to the second album, if I can convince Brian A. to donate or make a copy of that pic of the three holdin the Vegas sign.  It's Cory, Alex and Russell holding it up for some reason, and Cory/Russell are holding it up on the sides, where it's at its highest.  Alex is in the middle, where the sign comes down the LOWEST, and he's almost at a 90 degree angle.  I laughed till I almost cried...not very photogenic when unposed, that one.  Like I said before, more will come from Kings Dominion, plus a few from the pancake breakfast, maybe some from my bday (11 days yay), and definitely a few from jus goofin off w/ a camera.  I rele want my sister to get me this sunset photo album from Old Navy thats rele cute (preferably two), for all my other pictures. I'm incredibly drained, and I still need to squeeze in some studying time for my Chemistry and History SOLs.  Later.

      I have to take a shower before I go to work, so I'll jus share some of my usual random thoughts and such.  I may have already told some of you, but I happened to find some yearbook pictures on some CDs, and I found some cute prom pictures (heads up, Candy K., Will C., Katy, Jeff J., Mallory, Brittany V., Amanda L., Kim E., Edwin, Elias, Jessica R., Joe S., Mingo, Justin M., Brittany Bl., Lindsay F., Shannon C., Daniel P., Kim T., Lauren E., LaDawn, Kim K., Mango, Matt F., Tatiana, Mark C., Megan W., Chewy, Rebekah H., Amber B., Ricci S., Casey S., Yasmin, Monique B., Jasmine C., Whitney H., Kevin H., Paula I., Tom G., and the Prom Court...a big heads up to that guy Becca W.'s with, cause buddy, you look like a baboon in the picture).  If you want to see them, just copy and paste this into the place where you type internet sites, and then press enter (make sure to leave out the brackets: http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph2uOIBBQR5ULnfB&.dir=/1da2&.src=ph  That's for the second album...for the first, copy and paste this link: http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph1tOIBB6IBJZJXD&.dir=/d83d&.src=ph  I'm definitely bringing a camera tomorrow (unless I forget for the second day in a row), tomorrow (for the "life skills test"...AKA pancake breakfast), and Friday for Kings Dominion.  As always, I'll post them ASAP.  Speaking of photos, I wish I had one today, when Yasmin and Ashley B. started dancin to rap...good times.  I'll say more later, cause I really need to take a shower now.  Later.

      Aah, summer's finally here.  It's the time for straw hair one day, grease vats the next.  Stripes of sunburned faces (however, if u put sunscreen on in the rite places, u can create a natural blush).  Sunglasses galore.  Daydreamin of that cool water ur gonna plunge into rite after school ends.  Starin at all the hot guys who jus get hotter evry summer in their swim trunks.  Sand up ur butt (thats more a beach thing than the pool).  The first dive of the day to soak ur hair.  Missing ppl from school (unlike all u party animals that read this, I don't go to summer parties much, although that doesnt mean I wont go if u invite me...depends on the timin).  Day trips to the beach to catch a few waves (body surfin, i'm not nick b.).  Summer barbecues with friends.  Drinkin lemonade poolside with friends.  Two words: diving board (I had a bit of fun with my sister Jenni's friends...we played chicken, the simon says for diving boards, and i made the mistake of tellin them that there were a lot of my classmates there, so they had me waddling like a duck, doin splits, pretending to be constipated and sum other embarrassing stuff).  Amusement parks.  Walkin on the beach at nite watchin all the hot guys set off fireworks.  Jacuzzi hoppin.  I suppose that's enough for now. Today's been pretty good.  It's not how I would have chosen to celebrate my bday, but still.  As I mentioned before, we went to CRA with my cousin (she and her family came down from Maryland for the weekend), ate sum pizza, had my favorite type of simple cake (good ole yellow cake, cream cheese icing) and ice cream (cookies and cream, second only to chocolate chip cookie dough), and I opened my presents.  I got too many to list, but among the hilights were insoles (for Shoney's), two seasons of  Friends  DVDs, some clothes, lots of makeup (I FINALLY got that under eye brightening stick from clean and clear that makes ur dark circles less noticeable), lots of face stuff and some hair stuff.  I tried out that foam conditioner from Dove, something I've wanted for awhile, and it's absolutely awesome.  Plus, I got some money from my uncle and my grandparents...I also found out that I'm making 7.50 an hour, not 6.50 till I officially switch to hostess, so I'm gonna have enough money after all.  Almost all my birthday money is goin towards Puerto Rico tho, cuz I will forget to save for it.  I also want a pair of birks so I gotta save up for those.  There's no way my parents will spend $100 or more on a pair of shoes so thats my department.   Well evry1's waitin for me to come down so they can sing happy bday, so i g2g.  Later.

      Ok, for Edwin and all the people who keep questioning me incessantly about when I'm going to put that website with prom pictures on my blog again, here's the links.  The first one:   http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph1tOIBB6IBJZJXD&.dir=/d83d&.src=ph  and the second one:   http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph2uOIBBQR5ULnfB&.dir=/1da2&.src=ph  You'd better like those pics, Edwin, for all the aggravation.  Click on the slide show, cuz u can see them best.  Ok, now that I've ruined a perfectly good opening, I'll simply pretend THIS is the opening.  Please disregard this.  Amber: You're totally right.  We do need a class together. Nichole: Yeah, I definitely think senior year's the year [note: I've said this every year since sixth grade] Amber: and if we don't have a class together next year, we can go to college together! Nichole: Yeah!  We can sign up for all the same classes at Longwood [second note: I have no intention of going to Longwood...I'm all about goin to JMU] Amber: and if we're not together in college, we'll get jobs together! Nichole: Workin together 9-5.  It will sooo rock. Amber: and if we can't work together, well we'll just have to die together Nichole: That's a bit morbid, but sure we can be buried side by side  That's a recreation of one of the most odd conversations I've had this week.  Just for your reading pleasure.  Right now, I'm thinkin about NHS.  We had our speeches today for officer positions, and mine didn't go very well.  See, I was already trying to refrain from giggling all thru chem, cuz I had D12's My Band, especially the funniest part of the song - Slim mockign his female fans:   So I get off stage right and drop the mic Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like "Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady" I'm the lead singer in D12 baby They're all like "Oh my god it's him" "Becky oh my fuckin' god it's Eminem" "I swear to fuckin god dude you fuckin rock" "Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"  So I was already doin the thing where I'm tryin sooo hard not to laugh by making the apples of my cheeks protrude and smiling a little bit, when I look down at Mallory.  I don't remember why she was laughing, but she was.  I just lost it.  It took me forever to regain my composure.  Other than losing my place after that, I did semi-good.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure I didn't win.  If I wasn't running, I would have a rele hard time deciding between Sarah, Musty (Mustafa) and Megan, so I'm guessin they went for the ones that didn't crack up in the middle of their speeches.  It does kinda suck cuz i worked soo hard on that (too bad I didn't stick to it up there) and got so many ppl to edit it.   Ooh, ooh, good news!  MY BIRTHDAY'S IN TWO DAYS!!!!!!!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO BE SEVENTEEN!!!!!  I wanna go see a bunch of R rated movies, like Troy (see "what is sexy?" paragraph) and sum other flicks i can't think of rite now.  Of course, no matter how much Ashley says I'm an overgrown kid for liking kiddie movies, I still wanna go see Shrek 2.  Tripp says it's awesome (FYI: all ppl nicknamed Tripp are the third person in their family of that name...tripp is short for triple...didn't know that).  I love Shrek so much...the humor is on soo many levels, u always find a different joke every time u watch it that u never noticed b4.  Ooh, I'd better not start talkin about movies, or me n Alex will be goin on a THIRD movie date lol.  O dear Lord I gave them ideas. I was lookin over some earlier entries, and do u kno what?  Katy was absolutely rite.  1). I did talk a lot about food in the earlier entries (aw hell who am i kiddin i still do) and 2). I talk about Alex waaaaay too much in here.  I went and counted, and, out of about 60 entries, he's mentioned or hinted at...get ready for this... 30 freakin times .  Eleven times by name, the rest that I. or A. crap from my earlier entries, or innuendos.  I really am a bit of a smart ass sumtimes, straddling the line between that and a bitch a few times.  It's sad that even my best friends are only mentioned like seven times at the most, Shaheen ten (she'd be a friend, not a best friend).  Why does everyone say I'm so sweet and nice and kind and friendly if I'm such a bitch to him sometimes?  Very few times do I compliment him...I compliment other ppl a LOT (as Jason B. says, "I fish for compliments"...stupid bastard). Why does everything pertain to my life lately?  The quote I put as the title, "methinks the lady doth protest too much," means that if someone protests something excessively, it means they're lying.  And, I was looking up Ecclesiastes 3:3 for Monique (yearbook signing), and there was a verse, Ecclesiastes 3:8 that's almost scary: "A time for love, and a time for hate, a time for peace, and a time for war."  Speaking of yearbook signing, I got the last of the seniors to sign my yearbook today.  I do wish that Nick B., Ellen, Andrew R. and Will C. could have signed...other than Ellen, all the *interesting* ppl (haha thats code for loud mouths, but I really do like Nick and Andrew, even though Andrew used to be a total ass from like 6th to this year, and still is occasionally).  I really do love signing yearbooks, and reading what everyone has to say.  Yea, it's a bit fakey, but it's enjoyable.  For example, Jasmine, Stacy P., Zach and McKenzie all signed my yearbook in the same way (ur gr8! and sumthin else I can't remember rite now), and Katy, Emily, Mallory and Mary all signed mine, hinting at the lovely topics we discuss in journalism (journalism was fun today in 1st cuz we played rock paper scissors shoot and although I won over two, Will C. got to hit me...luckily he barely knicked me cuz he missed).  There's still sum ppl who I want to sign, but I'll see most of them tomorrow.   We were discussing what makes a person sexy in journalism today.  Of course, it's all about the ass and the boobs for guys, but it's a bit more difficult for the females.  It fluctuates from person to person.  My mom actually got a bit mad at me for having a brain fart and expressing my opinion towards a male celebrity...I said I was extremely surprised that George Michael is gay cuz he's the ultimate 80s sex god.  Actually, I think John Mayer's very sexy...he rocks my world, as the board goes.  I actually saw a guy who looked just like him at the car dealership, except that guy had blue eyes, not brown.  Blue eyes are hotter anyway (especially beautiful pool blue or clear blue or sky blue or icy blue or baby blue).  He was beautiful.  O man, u know what I found out today?  In Troy, BRAD PITT GETS NAKED!!!!!!  Wow, I definitely am gonna go see it now...me, dominique and a few guys (if Achilles is havin sex in the movie, then theres definitely a few girls naked too).  Just had to add that little tidbit in.  Back to "what is sexy" (Victoria's Secret).  Actually, that's about it...deep, expressive eyes are most important in the looks department.  It's sad; all my friends would say tall, good build, cute ass, beautiful eyes, shiny hair, but I'm more about personality...although I'm up for a guy with nice hair and a cute ass... ;) .    Well I got to go to work (I have to be there at 5:50), so I'll add more later.  If you come by Shoney's and I'm chuckling to myself, I'm probably thinking about the lines, "I swear to f'in god dude you f'in rock, Please Marshall please let me suck your [well you get the point]."  Later dudes (from the song lol).

      Nonsmoking French people...sheer lunacy, right?  Actually, it's true.  I was hostessing at Shoney's (btw hostessing is sooo much more fun than salad bar...on Saturday, I was on at least cloud seven and a half), and I seated two French people who requested the non-smoking section.  Thank goodness Dominique taught me to count to five in French: un, deux, trois, quatre, cinc (I'm sure those are misspelled).  I also know monsieur, madmoiselle, madame, merci, au revoir, parlez vous Francais, and, of course, a certain phrase courtesy of Ms Christina that I'll never use (listen to Lady Marmalade).  I tend to take a milder version of Miss Pross's attitude to the French (read A Tale of Two Cities) - French people aren't very nice.  The French people I sat were kindly, and I love Mrs. Jordan (Keyette sponsor), but in general my experiences with them aren't very good.  Here's my French quotes:       "This from the country whose greatest cultural contribution is a horny skunk?" -Darrell Hammond, Best of Christopher Walken, SNL       "Victory?  We're FRENCH!  We don't even have a word for it!" -Homer Simpson, from the parody of Joan of Arc, The Simpsons  Know what else cramps my style?  Pricks.  It seems that as soon as one person stops being one, another one shows up.  Every single year since middle school, there's been one worse than the next.  In sixth grade, there was Ryan, seventh and eighth Chewy (do NOT believe the stories about Spanish II), ninth Hunter (I suppose she's a bitch, not a prick), and tenth Alex (bio - worst class ever, even when the subject got occasionally interesting).  I suppose he stopped being one this year, maybe around winter break.  Actually, he's been really nice lately.  Anyway, back to this new character.  He works with me, and thinks he's better than me.  America, if there's one thing that will make me instantly dislike you, it's ARROGANCE.  I hate that!  Unless you have a redeeming characteristic to balance the conceit, I WILL instantly dislike you.  Come to think of it, just about everyone I've ever disliked I've disliked because of pride (or supercilliousness, if you're Shaheen).  Ryan, Chewy, ESPECIALLY Alex...of course there's others, but those are the major ones.   Enough ranting and raving about arrogance and French people.  We had our yearbook distribution day, in which I screamed my bloody head off telling people "J, K and L HERE" and other stuff that I'd rather not have shouted.  I wish I could have gotten more people to sign my yearbook though (by the time Mr Young finally let us go, almost everyone was gone...I just went to the newsroom and had another go with the front page...actually, there wasn't much to do besides changing everything from March to June, and aligning everything at the bottom, which was no easy feat).  There's always tomorrow. We went birthday shopping today, and I found THE most adorable hair things.  There's this 50s inspired black and white hair band (for the guys, that wide thing that is just a tiny bit further back from the place where the hairline meets the forehead); this fluffy clip-on pink flower that would be great with a side ponytail, a coral shirt and a denim skirt; and this hairband with two chiffon scarves attached that looks just like those retro girls that wave the scarves to start the races on roads with names like "Thunder Road" (straight from Grease). Wow, I am waaay too excited over some hair accessories.  For the price though ($3 each, about $13 total), it's difficult to beat.  I've been shopping THREE times for my birthday, and with the exception of a cute pink top, I can't find any shirts I like, and I need at least three.  I definitely want to try that layered tanks thing, which looks so damn cool on that Gap commercial (told you I'm a sucker for advertising).   Well I'm all written out for the day (plus, other than more tales of work, which you're probably sick of, and how I scrambled all day to finish Boswell's paper, and how people don't really like the yearbook this year, especially the people section, I really don't have much else to say).  I'm also tired, because I slept between 40 minutes and two hours, which just makes you more tired.  One more random quote courtesy of Brittany E.'s profile: "Should I smile cuz you're my friend or cry cuz thats all we'll ever be?"  Later.

      I'm angry at just about everyone right now - the seniors in yearbook and journalism who left us with next to nothing (especially in yearbook), some work ppl, my dad, my mom (see the title - to finish that statement, I could buy myself three Porshes; so much for "you can talk to me about ANYTHING"), teachers who just won't let up on the work (overzealous, thy name is Boswell...or Eyre), the administration for not allowing enough time for newspaper crises (which always happen right at the end of the period, when u have a class on the other side of the school), my friends for all being away when I need to talk (and for all having busy schedules so I have to reschedule my times with them like three times), myself (for not learning quickly enough), and my mom some more.  But I refuse to vent - other than the above - cause this is my sixtieth entry!  I'm very, very proud of myself.  I didn't even think I'd write in this more than three times, but I ended writing twenty times that!  Ok, that's what I said yesterday, when I wrote all that stuff and needed to just yell at something.  Now, I'm better.  Rooney's playin on the radio, and how can you not mellow out a bit to the tunes of "Blueside?"  Not much has changed as far as anger, except I'm a bit less angry with my mom, more angry at my friends (mostly my best friends), and most angry with my teachers.  But I'm not gonna focus on that, or the mounting loads of work in newspaper and yearbook.  I'm gonna focus on the things all stereotypical blondes use to cheer themselves up: boys and hair.  Since there isn't anyone in particular on the crush horizon (hot boys yes, anyone in particular, no), I'll just focus on my hair.  I borrowed this lady's shampoo and conditioner, and my hair's never been so shiny.  It's that sheer blonde stuff from John Freida, that supposedly removes all the pollutants and stuff that darkens your hair.  My hair's not lighter, but it sure is glossy.  As Emily would say, it's "Mallory hair" (she has really, really perfect hair that's always shiny).  I think I might actually wear it down, a rarity seen by few outside of yearbook camp and the pool.  Oh, congrats to Emily (while I'm on the subject) for having Mallory hair too!  She got it straightened, and it really looks great.  If my hair weren't stick straight, I'd get that permanent straightening done myself, just to have hair that shiny. Speaking of the pool, I have a new person to add to the anger list - my sister.  It all started with another of her BRILLIANT plans (that's sarcasm sweetie) - let's go to the pool!  Guess who's a lifeguard this year?  Shaheen's beloved Zachary (Zach).  I have nothing against him, but he's definitely near the top of the list of people I don't want to see me swimming.  Why? 1). I'm no Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue model; 2). I'm a slow swimmer...I can hold my own at the beach and stuff, but I will lose to anyone who challenges me to swim who's above the age of eight and can swim; and 3). I never gave up playing all those pool games, like marco polo, categories, diving for pennies, alligator, shark, the color game, tunnel tag, drain tag, and all those good pasttimes.  So, I'm not crazy about the idea of him looking at me at the pool.  The boy has, like, -5% body fat, and I have, well, more than that.  It could be worse, at least numbers one, two and three don't go to CRA.  I hope to God they don't.  Don't get inspired to come, either!   Well I need to study for my Math Analysis test.  For those who have read this at least once, you know I just want to give my undivided attention to the ppl I'm talkin to right now.  Later.

      Bless that beautiful boy.  A wonderful, sweet boy is taking over salad bar.  He's "kinda like Jesus but not in a sacriligious way" (Homer Simpson), relieving me of my burdens.  When school lets out, I'll be hostessing almost full time.  I love him.  Not literally cuz I barely know him, but I certainly like him very much.  Actually, I don't love all that many people.  I love my friends, my best friends, some of my acquaintances, some of the ppl I work with, some of my teachers (this year, Boswell, Davis, Knight, Young and Gill...Eyre's ok), some of the ppl I go to church with, all my Keyette girls, my journalism girls (and some of the guys), my yearbook girls and guys, and, of course, my family.  It sounds like a lot, but it's no more than like 100 ppl.  Out of 6.4 billion, that's miniscule, and still a small number compared to the 2194 ppl who attend TD.  Speaking of my family, I'm very angry with my dad, and I need a good boxing match.  We have those frequently cuz we're both secret hotheads.  Anyway I had to work today and I was supposed to get off at 8, givin my parents plenty of time to go to Garden Ridge.  However, they told too many ppl to come in for salad bar, so I volunteered to go home, partly cuz i was the least experienced person there, partly cuz i wanted to talk to my friends, but mostly because The Simpsons comes on tonite.  So I call my Papa (grandfather) so he can pick me up at 6.  Then I learn I'm gettin off at 5, not 6.  I then call my parents to let them know.  I CLEARLY said that Papa was gonna pick me up at six.  So my dad shows up at 5:30 (the lady was late in comin in) and gets mad at me cuz he said that I asked for a ride.  He jus would not let it go!  Finally I jus said some choice words and walked away.  Anyway, we screamed at each other for 10 minutes (I'm not exaggerating in the least).  Ah well, he'll get over it. I'm tryin to do so much rite now its not even funny.  I'm listenin to music, writin in this, talkin to shaheen, kortny, maisie (jenni's sister) and kayla (another one of jenni's girls...i'm like their big friends), making out my to do list, readin annie's mailbox (Ann Landers), ponderin jus how mad my mom would be if i pulled out all the photo albums out to find a baby picture for the baby spread (i want to get it in before school ends so I dont worry about it), tryin to remember who I've forgotten to invite on Saturday (to avoid sum hurt feelings) and watchin my dogs howl (my mom and sister are havin a howling match with them - they howl, then my mom and sister howl...it's funny).  My dogs are so beautiful.  I'm not being conceited, it's a fact.  They're Huskies.  The whiny one, Rocky, is black and white (think of wolves...he scares everyone cuz evry1 thinks hes a wolf), and my dog, Rascal, is the beauty queen of dogs - she's snow white, except for some rust colored fur on her back, has one blue eye, one green eye, long legs and the sweetest personality.  They're the best listeners, and they lick my hand when I'm done...plz don't get any ideas from them.  I love to talk to them...they're just more understanding than my cat, who's ready to scratch me by the time I finish talkin to her.  Don't think I'm crazy for talkin to my pets, I have plenty of awesome ppl I can go to for advice or unloading, but I know that they won't gossip or get offended by something I say.  Now that I'm finished creepin u out lol... What was I gonna talk about?  Oh yea, my habit I'm tryin to break, and the fact that my cousin (Xiomara, not Stephanie - Xiomara is pronounced see-oh-mahra) is a moronic rock hater.  In addition to tryin not to curse anymore (judging from my blog entries, I'm doin a GREAT job...not), I'm tryin not to say the s-word so much.  Wait, doesn't the s-word fall under cuss words?  No, I'm tryin to limit the amount of times I say sorry.  My manager says I say it waaaay too much, and so does Shaheen and sum other ppl.  It's simply automatic.  Bump into someone - I'm sorry.  Someone's had a bad day - I'm sorry.  Screw up something - I'm sorry.  Insult someone accidentally - I'm sorry.  Anyway, I'm really tryin to keep it down.  As for my cousin, here's the gist of why my cousin's musical tastes deeply disturb me: TDMonMon875: i got a song 4 u TDMonMon875: i promise u'll like it LaBebeBoricua375: ok? TDMonMon875: go on radio at aol LaBebeBoricua375: i dont have AOL no more!

TDMonMon875: mk TDMonMon875: do u like jam bands LaBebeBoricua375: no TDMonMon875: WHAT?? TDMonMon875: you poor, culturally misguided child LaBebeBoricua375: lol TDMonMon875: u dont like DMB? TDMonMon875: or phish?

I respect pplz rights to listen to whatever they want, but I'm personally all about rock, jam bands, some Top 40, more rock, and country.  The poor misguided child even said she doesn't know who NIRVANA is!!!!  I miss Jessica K.; she could recite Nirvana's bio by heart, especially Kurt Cobain (RIP).  Actually, I'm in the mood for Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Right now I'm listenin to my other favorite song (besides The Reason) - Finger Eleven's One Thing.  Check it out sometime, promise u'll like it.   My sister wants to dish and take sum more drama, so I g2g.  One quote before I go - "Why do parents try to teach us how to walk n talk for the first 3 years of our lives but for the rest they tell us to sit down and shut up?"  Truly a thought to ponder sometime.  Later.

      I do feel kind of sorry for my mom - for the first time in like three months she took me out driving today (my parents won't let me get my license until I can pay the first six months worth of car insurance, $200 or more).  She was shaking for about an hour afterward, and I thought I saw her having an anxiety attack a few times.  I really am not that bad of a driver, it's just been awhile.  I REALLY scared her when I was supposed to turn left outside the Old Centralia exit from school, where I usually turn right on Route 10 to go to my house (actually, my ride goes right lol).  Out of habit, I went into the right lane.  My mom starts screaming at me, and I swerved into the left.  Other than that, I did ok.  Oh yea, there was one other time, when I got distracted goin 50 down Jeff Davis (we were joking about all the "side business" at our town's finest hotels), and I went into the other lane a bit.  Yeah, I suppose I didn't do very good.  I do have seven weeks to improve, though (that's excluding yearbook camp, vacation and a few other dates).  I've ridden with people who have done MUCH worse; one time, I rode with someone (this person graduated, so I suppose it's ok to share it), and I warned the person that there was a stop sign ahead.  It's very hard to see cause it's at the bottom of a hill and has all kinds of shrubs and trees growing around it.  Anyway, the person's about ten feet away when I'm like aren't u gonna stop.  THREE FEET away from the sign, the person slams on breaks, barely missing another car.  Amber scares me too, especially when she pulls away from the school.  Celicas go from 0 to 45 really quickly, and it always takes my breath away for awhile, and my heart stops for a second.  I can't say every teenage driver is bad, cause I've been with some good ones and some terrible adult drivers.  I've never seen an old person drive badly.  Actually, I usually drive fairly slowly for the speed limit, except on the highway - I have a bad habit of checking my mirrors so much that I forget about the speedometer and before I know it the person with me starts shrieking about how I'm going 75 in a 65 area.  Despite all that, my sister still wants me to be her taxi as soon as I get my license.  Some people are just desperate, I suppose. Wow, I'm still a little tired from yesterday.  First, my dogs (two huskies who are about one and a half - they're brother and sister) got out.  I swear that the female, Rascal (that's her name), is Houdini incarnate.  For the gazillionth time, she wriggled out of her chain, and, to make things worse, she's extremely fast.  I'd be willing to bet she could give a grayhound a run for his money.  So the other one, the male, Rocky, is howlin like crazy (he's a huge baby), so I looked out the window to see what was wrong.  I clipped him on a leash so she would come to him, and there's Rascal, chillin in the front yard.  Rocky may be slower, but he's clever.  He ran really fast while I had the rope part of the leash in his hand, burning my hand so I'd drop it.  He ran off with her, so I got the bike.  I rode for about 3/4 of a mile goin everywhere trying to find them, and got Rocky on the most hilly part of the neighborhood.  I then proceeded to walk an additional 2 and 1/4 mile looking for her.  I finally found her after an hour, in the neighbor's yard.  What's worse, I walked another two miles to school to meet the new journalism adviser, and she wasn't even there.  Do NOT get me started on that (not the fact that she wasn't there, the other stuff that happened).   I have to get ready for work now, so I'll end it with this, paraphrased courtesy of News of the Weird (oh man, that reminds me of another thing I wanted to talk about, but I don't have time): this guy served 12 years in prison for burgulary and assault, and as soon as he walks out of jail, he carjacks a lady in the prison parking lot!  Later.

      The peace sign is forever ruined for me. I made the mistake of asking Shawn G. and Alex a sex question (does that V thing u do with ur fingers that looks like the symbol for peace rele mean u want to get sum), and they made sure to keep my face crimson the entire class. Both of them kept flashing it the ENTIRE class, and Alex drew it on the white board to me! I don't take it seriously for a sec, but it was still a bit embarrassing. Thank God that was the last math analysis class I'll ever have with them. Hopefully they didn't sign up to take AP Stat, cuz I'll never live that one down.  In case you can't tell, I'm practicing for when I'm a senior...having senioritis.  This is straight from my buddy profile, except I'm adding a few things on this.  I'm not sure why, because no one reads this anymore.  Good for me cause I can say what I want again...it will be like a neo-classical age in the blog.  To celebrate a neo-classical revival, I'm putting in some lines soon to be classics.  The first two come from a worksheet we did in Boswell's class on parallelism.    Marcus: "To be popular, she thought, she only had to earn straight A's, drive a sweet car and date a guy like Mike M."   Matt F.: "She was afraid of everything, of little blonde haired children, of fields of tall cornstalks, and of bloody sickles (yea the last one's weird).  Boswell (to Frederick): "Don't mess with the Bos."  Deanna: "Julie Ann, stop touching my boobs."  Shaheen: "Of course the V exists.  That's what happens when you open your legs."  Alex: the V...I tried making a hand, but it just looks like a series of backslashes and underscores when I publish it.  \/ - how about that.  No,I don't want any u sickos.  It's the classic line.   Today was my last day of school (real school, not meddlesome exams). Oddly, I felt the greatest sadness walking out of Mrs. Boswell's class. If I wasn't as respectful as I am (laugh Yasmin), I would have done cartwheels in the doorway goin out of Math Analysis. I'm really gonna miss English, somewhat miss History (mostly because I'll miss having it w/ my best friend, and I'll miss Knight's interesting spin on stuff, even if he can be a bit annoying at times...ok Joe sorry for saying that about ur IDOL), I'll miss the PEOPLE in chemistry (definitely not the subject!), I'll definitely miss journalism, and I may miss yearbook (right now I'm pissed about yearbook stuff so I'll prolly miss it around mid July). However, I'm really looking forward to next year. I'm working all this summer, save yearbook camp (if I go) and Puerto Rico, so I'm not gonna have much of a break. Most likely, I'll have them hold my job when I start school so I can do that harrowgate tutors thing. Anyway, back to senior year. I really hope I have lots of friends in my classes, cause I just found out that all the honors history are being bumped up to AP. I'm kind of hoping that I'll somehow still be in Z level, cause I may be with some friends and it won't be as difficult. There's a chance I may be, because I had drop and add three classes, so I wrote the Z level to Honors on the back. I'm also taking a journalism class, two publications (oh yea, I'm a newspaper freak, if u ever had ne doubts), AP English, AP Stat, either Z level or AP Government and Dual Enrollment Environmental Science and Marine Ecology.  Now do u see why I'm worried about history?  It's going to be extremely difficult to handle 3-4 college courses.   Well I'm gonna try and enjoy the little summer I'm gonna have. I went to the pool today, and while I'm brown on my hands when palms face downward, I'm white on the other side, even though I tanned with my palms facing up so I could get a little sun. I fell asleep while I was laying out, so I'm dreading what's going to happen to the back of my legs. Quick question before I end it - why do u never get burned under ur eyes? I have a cherry tomato-like stain across my nose and the apples of my cheeks, but nothing under my eyes. I'm getting some atrocious freckles, so I really need to start wearing sunscreen on my nose (I hate the stuff cause I never get a tan when I wear it). Later.

      For once, the title is straightforward.  While they smell the same, they have very, very different properties.  Peppermints go in your mouth and freshen your breath for six seconds.  Peppermint oil is evil.  Last night, at work, I was rearranging the decorative lettuce on the bar, which is soaked in peppermint oil.  I wasn't wearing any gloves, because I was technically off, and helping out the waitresses.  BAD IDEA.  Peppermint oil burns everything it comes in contact with.  My hands started burning (like they were on FIRE) between my fingers.  I forgot once they stopped hurting, and rubbed my eyes, causing those to feel like I had poured tabasco sauce (or, how I envision tabasco sauce would feel like on the eyes).  Then, I had something in my nose, so I rubbed it.  That was probably worst of all.  Imagine pepper spray sprayed straight up your nose.  That about covers it.  I couldn't smell for an hour, just like drug dogs around cocaine.  Did you know that in WWII, the ppl who helped Jews escape would put cocaine in picnic baskets, in the boats, just about everywhere so dogs would lose the scent?  Sorry, but I love everything about the Holocaust and WWII, except the fact that so many ppl lost their lives.  I want to go to the Washington Holocaust Museum soooo badly, and to the one in my state.   Well my mom's been bugging me for the past fifteen minutes to hurry up so we can go to the Y, so I'll leave you confused.  Later.

      No, I am not lifting weights.  My titles never mean what they say.  I put that because I feel as though a huge weight has been lifted off my chest.  I got everything straight today.  I'm in everything I wanted to be, and not a single class I didn't want to be in.  However, this victory is somewhat tainted by the reactions I'm going to get come September.  Before you all (and I can think of some of the pissed off people who would do this) gather your pitchforks and torches and pay me a visit, just know that I did it to make me happy, and I would rather be happy than try to make people happy.  I would have had a miserable senior year had I just done some things for others.  In the end, if it's your happiness or mine, I'm going to pick my own.  It's selfish, but I wouldn't be much use to anyone anyway if I was mopey or angry all the time.  Although most of you are probably doing an eyebrow lift like The Rock (the confused look, Deanna), a few of you know what I'm talking about, and I hope you understand.  If not, I'm certainly not going to lose any sleep worrying about you.   I'm going to check to see who's winning in the polls.  I'll bet that not one of you left a comment though.  Oh well, I know that, in my heart, Friends is your choice.  Later.

      In case you're wondering, I'm not unsure of something, but in pain.  My stomach hurts like crazy, and I'm still burping from what is perhaps the second most disgusting edible substance ever invented: alka seltzer.  See, I'm a HUGE baby when it comes to stomachaches, and I was looking for something to ease the monster brewing inside my stomach organ.  I thought, it bubbles, it fizzes (and it will keep a cold away), it will be just like Ginger Ale, a miracle substance that, unfortunately, my grandfather was out of.  I was WRONG!  It was sickly sweet and slimy, much like eating soapy water with sugar.  However, I have never eaten soap, so I'm not sure exactly what it was like.  I do know it was disgusting, and that I got my sister to tip it down the sink after about five sips.  In case you're wondering, the most disgusting substance known to man is Nyquil.  I'd pay good money to watch someone chug a bottle of that stuff.  Number three is definitely any cherry flavored medicine.  Nothing against medicine, I just don't like it, other than amoxicilin and a few other pills.  Man, that takes me back.  I took that stuff like crazy for my ears, cause I was always getting earaches.  Hmm, it really helped (for those who don't know me, I have terrible hearing).  However, that bubblegum taste completely makes up for it.  I miss that stuff. I bought this new stuff yesterday, that hair lightener I've wanted.  I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet, cause I haven't been in the sun in awhile.  I did use this texturizer stuff that came with it, and I like it.  You spray it in your hair, twist it and air dry.  I must admit, that's the closest my hair's been to beach water dried in it without bein at the beach.  My hair was really stringy, though (Emily taught me that word, it means your hair looks like crimped spaghetti - that's not how she explained it, but it's how I remember it).  I really liked the look; it looked very "I've just rolled out of bed, it's humid, I air-dried my hair but my hair still looks decent."  I'll prolly wear my hair like that more if I can find a larger version of that.  I may do the cheap version, and fill up a bunch of squirt bottles with sea water (it says it's sea water), and put in a tiny bit of virgin olive oil and lemon.  I'll let u kno how that one works out. As I normally do on a lazy summer day, I spent the day bonding with the television.  I was watching this thing on Ripley's Believe It or Not, and in India, they put cow's urine all over their homes and faces.  I looked it up online, and their holy book says that killing a cow is punishable by death.  Listen to this:   This explains why during the Second World War, "American servicemen in Calcutta were instructed that if a traffic situation arose in which the driver had a choice of striking a cow or a human, hit the human and proceed without stopping to a police station"  Wow.  I like cows (they're cute), but I couldn't hit a human being over one.  I love animals and all, but I couldn't kill a human over one.  I definitely couldn't put any pee on myself either.  The bathroom itself grosses me out.  Heather W. once told me that the particles in your toilet can travel up to six feet, and ever since then, I've never looked at the room in the same way.   Well my home antidote (ice cream left over from the party I threw for my sister) isn't working as well as hoped.  In defense of ice cream, it did work well while I was eating it.  Maybe there's still some Pepto-Bismol from my dad's trip to Peru last summer.  I'm gonna go tear apart the linen closet.  Later.

      That's straight from my away message.  I may have to go tomorrow, just to talk to my guidance counselor, although if i do go, I'm not goin till at least nine.  It's a bit surreal, though.  It was like, this is the last time I'll be wearing mascara just to make myself look decent for three months (don't get me wrong, I'll wear it in Puerto Rico and stuff, but it will be jus because, not to look nice).  This is the last time I'll sigh a million times cause I have no idea what I'm doin durin a Math Analysis test.  This is the last time I'll hear those supremely annoying noises that are either coming from Roger or Alex.  This is the last time Dominique and I will dance down the halls in celebration.  This is the last textbook to turn in, the last grade, the last time I'll see Boswell.  You get the point.  I am happy to have a long break from waking up early.  Next year will be the last I'll wake up early by choice until I have a career (unless I have early morning college classes).  Wow.   There's lots to look forward to, though.  My cousin's wedding is on the 26, which means a major shopping trip soon, combined with a Puerto Rico shopping trip.  I need some spray in lightener, cause my hair was cornflower white the last time I went (seven), and it would be nice for it to be a bit lighter.  I definitely need some sun dresses, sunglasses, a sand castle building kit, water bombs, snorkeling goggles (we're swimmin out to a coral reef one of the days...hopefully my mom will let me go scuba diving too), sugar cubes for horseback riding, and some other stuff, especially flip flops and dress shoes.  I broke my last pair today (I've broken three shoes this week...it's not my fault if the straps are made cheaply).  Man, I'm in the mood for shopping now!  Anyway, I also have 4th of July, even if it will be sans big splash contest.   Well, I need to call get offline to call my mom.  Later.

      I don't WANT to study for Math!  I'm in full summer swing!  Today is the perfect example.  My sister and I created her blog (she has one now but she hasnt posted anything) and watched Friends DVDs, the complete third season.  Oh, and we didn't get dressed until 1:00 PM.  It's gonna take forever to get adjusted back into summer life.   Just 18 days till vacation! That's really about it.

      Why?  I have this mask on my face that was supposed to stay on for 60 seconds, and it's been on about 10 minutes, and it's not coming off.  I just hope the 2% salycic acid doesn't burn my face (I heard u can get chemical burns from leaving facial masks on for too long), and between hot water, more hot water and the sun, my skin's about maxed out for burns.   I was looking at my legs last night, and they really look terrible.  There's about a four inch strip of leg (from my butt to the backs of my knees) on the back that's burnt red, and all around it is white.  I even have the cheesy coppertone tan lines.  You know, where that dog is biting the little girl's bathing suit, showing her white butt.  Actually, that creeps me out.  Why do advertising companies think they will sell more sunscreen by showing a little girl's butt?  Is it supposed to attract dirty old men?  Teenagers who go to tanning salons (most of them to AVOID those type tan lines)?  Little girls who want a puppy?   I have to take a shower before church (unless you really want to ponder why I smell like I jumped in a pool of shrimp and tartar sauce.  Ah, that reminds me of Sponge Bob.  Are you ready kids?  Ay ay captain!  I can't hear you!  AY AY CAPTAIN!  Oooo, who lives in a pineapple under the sea?  SPONGE BOB SQUARE PANTS (you definitely want to leave now, cause now I have it in my head.

      I am soooo ready for vacation.  Yesterday (Father's Day) was absolutely terrible.  I won this thing at after-prom, good for a free round of golf, and I thought that I'd give it to my dad for Father's Day, since he loves golf.  That was a big mistake.  Unfortunately, it expired June 1, and when he called the golf place to extend the date, he found out it was free (well, technically it was $5, the cost of my afterprom ticket).  So, I have to get him a new present.  Ok, ok, two presents to make up for not putting much thought into his gift.  It's just that I know exactly what my mom likes and doesn't like, because we go shopping together, talk, actually spend time together.  I don't really know what he wants, and he's terribly picky.  He's Rachel - very rarely does he ever keep a gift; if he doesn't return it, he complains till we get him something else, and uses the return money to pay bills, and complains he didn't get a present cause he had to use the money for bills.  So, I really don't like Father's Day in the first place.  To make things worse, SOMEONE had the brilliant idea to serve a third straight night of seafood on the bar, so I didn't get home until two hours after I was supposed to get off.  My dad yelled at me the entire way home (I was an hour and 55 minutes late, but I had to clean and stock everything), and I started crying.  One funny thing did happen at work, but it's funny enough to send to Reader's Digest and get money.  Since you can't publish the joke anywhere else, I'm not skippin out on the possibility of $200 to tell a funny story.  Plus, one of the best comedies ever, Zoolander came on last night, and that instantly cheered me up.  There's just something about watching an idiotic male model being brainwashed to kill political figures that makes you laugh.    Matilda: I used to be bulimic. Derek: You can read minds?  Of course, there's also the Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good, and Will Ferrell.  It's inching its way up to the list of Best Movies Ever. I think I've figured out why I haven't been sleeping well lately.  I rearranged the furniture in my room, and ever since, I've slept so much better.  Now, I don't believe in that feng shui thing for a second, but I do believe that moving my bed from the middle of the longest wall to the corner of the longest wall and the wall with a window did make a difference.  That, and I haven't drank milk in three days, not counting this morning.  I'm usually very strict about getting all three servings a day, but milk prices have skyrocketed.  Every time I go to get some, I'm afraid I'll drink enough to buy another gallon.  I'll just have to find some vitamins or something with lots of calcium. Well I wanted to check out Shaheen's blog before this new internet service freezes.  I absolutely hate it, and hope that my mom will cancel it ASAP and get AOL back soon (or at least high speed internet).  Later.

      Since I got AOL back this morning, the first thing I did was write a post.  Actually, that's not completely true.  I read Shaheen's blog, wrote one post, looked up something for the post, and accidentally switched screen names, therefore losing the post.  Anyway, it's been a while since I've written, so, naturally, lots has happened since then. Probably the best was my cousin's wedding.  I want a wedding similar to theirs.  They had it at this church I've been DYING to see for myself, and everyone's right: it's not as big on the inside as one might think.  Of course, I want to tie the knot on the beach, or somewhere close to the beach, so that's not a problem.  When I was little, I said that I would wear a bathing suit underneath my dress, and just tear it off and go swimming in the ocean after we said our vows.  Anyway, back to their wedding.  The bridesmaids looked pretty, and SOME of the groomsmen handsome, but what really stole the show were the flower girls, the bride's assistant (is that the name for the girl that isn't a flower girl, but walk down the aisle?), and especially the ring bearer.  Those girls were so adorable.  They had on little wedding dresses, and I swear that one of them looks just like Ruthie from the early years of of Seventh Heaven.  The ring bearer was maybe four, and when he got to the stage, he laid down on the stage and almost went to sleep!  It was such an awwww moment.  Anyway, Stephanie (the bride, not my cousin, who was a bridesmaid) looked like a princess escaped from a Disney movie.  She even had the fair skin and red lips to match.  I could have never pulled off the dress she wore, but she looked like a princess on the way to a ball, awaiting Prince Charming.  I'm not sure if my cousin Benji (it's still weird to say Ben) is Prince Charming, though.  He's very considerate, sweet and gentlemanly, but he's a bit obsessed with Nascar.  After the wedding, my mom, sister and I (my dad didn't come - Benji is my mom's nephew) went to the reception.  Until the wedding party came, we got stuck with all the relatives I dislike, except for Richard and Teresa.  Richard's my mom's brother, and Teresa's his wife of about a year and a half.  I don't usually say uncle or aunt before my relative's first names.  In fact, the only adults I don't call by first name are my maternal grandparents (Ganny and Papa; my dad's mom I call Maria, step-grandmother Cruz, step-grandfather Jose - yes, in English that translates to Mary and Joseph - and I'm not sure what I call my grandfather...I suppose I'll know when I get back), most teachers, strangers, our persnickety neighbors, and some people at work.  Anyway, when Donna and Clayton (my aunt and uncle, the groom's parents) arrived, they separated us, thankfully, and put us with all the extended relatives I like, and down to three I dislike.  I really like two aunts (Donna, my mom's sister and Teresa), and two uncles (Clayton and Richard), my grandparents, and a few from Clayton's side.  The reception in general was very entertaining.  Of course, when you're given a camera and allowed to do whatever you want with it, you're gonna have fun.  Jenni and I took some goofy pictures, and some pictures of the cake cutting, the first dances, the toasts, and the bouquet/garter throwing.  Jenni also got the two hottest groomsmen to take pictures with her, one of them being the one who caught Stephanie's garter (Stephanie the bride).  (One of Stephanie's sisters caught the bouquet.)  The only downside was the food.  Most of it tasted terrific, but something we ate disagreed with us, and my sister, mom and I all had stomachaches.  It may have just been too rich after a week of peanut butter toast and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (peanut butter and soup were about the only edible thing left in the house - my mom picked up a couple of things from Wal-mart, breaking her annual "I refuse to buy groceries right before vacation" speech).  Teresa also taught me that you do a crossover instead of a shuffle during the Electric Slide.  I was taught, incorrectly, to shuffle instead of step, cross (left over right for all the guys reading), step.   The wedding was pretty much the high point over the past few days.  Sunday I had to work eight and a half hours, the longest I've ever worked (I've done seven and a half hours before, but not eight and a half), and I was on my feet for five hours straight.  I know it sounds like whining, but I simply can't pull 14 hours like the waitresses and kitchen staff can, even though some of them are a bit hefty.  After about three hours, my feet fall asleep or feel like they're being pricked by needles.  Then, on Monday, we spent the day worrying over a family thing (I don't want to talk about it).  Tuesday shouldn't have been fun, but, terrible as it may sound, it was.  We spent part of the day at the hospital.  This is even worse, but I actually like hospitals (except when I'm a patient).  You can look at the newborns, go to the gift shop, go to the cafeteria or McDonalds, go to the coffee shop, take a walk outside or inside, or watch TV.  However, I have learned something not so pleasant about hospitals: the gift shops are very overpriced.  They wanted $20 for a bear that sang "Happy Together" by the Turtles ("Me and you and you and me, No matter how they toss the dice, It had to be, The only one for me is you, And you for me, So happy together, I can see me lovin' nobody but you, For all my life, When you're with me baby the skies'll be blue, For all my life").  Given, it was adorable, but not as adorable after after I saw the price tag.  They also had these puppets that sang a note when you moved their mouths.  I was playing with a pig, and figured out that it sang "Old MacDonald Had A Farm" and another song I can't remember.  My sister and I had made sugar cookies, but we decided to buy two balloons and these animal magnets (we got one white cat with blue eyes, and a husky dog that looked a bit like a mixture of our dogs).  The lady attached them at the bottom as weights, but she tied the ribbon around the magnet animals' necks.  Later, I untied it and put the ribbons around their waists.   Anyway, other than packing for Puerto Rico, those have been the hilights of the week.  Sorry it's so long, but I haven't really been able to write that kind of stuff in the notebook.  Be assured that the one I write when I return from Puerto Rico will be even longer.  Later.

       Yeah, yeah, I know.&nbsp; It's been awhile.&nbsp; I got back late Friday night; Saturday was laundry day/tidy up the house day; Sunday I had church, then work about an hour and a half later; yesterday, I took my sister to go see Anchorman (which by the way is the best low comedy since Austin Powers, no joke), saving me from having to go see A Cinderella Story with her.&nbsp;    Puerto Rico was absolutely amazing, but I really don't want to write about it.&nbsp; In fact, I'm just not up to sharing all my thoughts with the world anymore.&nbsp; I kept a mini journal (more to record my experiences than my thoughts), and one night I got really, really angry with my dad.&nbsp; I was very sick, and he wanted to eat at a Chinese place with his family,&nbsp;which he knows I can't eat because it makes me throw up.&nbsp; I was rushing to the bathroom after eating some Chinese ($12.50 for two plates, which isn't cheap, so I ate more to satisfy everyone eating with us), and it wasn't to throw up, if you catch my drift.&nbsp; I tripped and hit the floor before I could catch my balance, and my dad pointed it out, so he could look good for the family we only see ONCE&nbsp;EVERY FOUR YEARS.&nbsp; He then informed the rest of the family (the rest, who hadn't pointed at me and laughed), and they all laughed at me and fired quips in Spanish, most of which I could understand.&nbsp; I'm not the most coordinated person and trip more than the average person, so I've learned to laugh it off most of the time, but when you're sick, don't even want to see food (much less eat it), and trip trying to get to the bathroom, it's definitely not funny.&nbsp; Anyway, I wrote a long letter in the journal, to my dad, listing exactly why I was angry with him, and ended up not giving it to him, because he simply dismissed it as PMS (which, conveniently for him, occurs all month long, so that whenever I'm upset at the latest insensitive thing he's done, I'm automatically upset because of PMS).&nbsp; The worst part is that my sister read every word of it.&nbsp; That letter was NOT intended for her, and neither was the rant I wrote in my journal afterwards.&nbsp; Of course, it's not like a person needs privacy or a place to put their thoughts anyway.&nbsp; She somehow found the address and read everything on here, so I don't even like to write more than what will keep me out of trouble with my mom (who I'm 90% sure doesn't read this, since she doesn't like the Internet).&nbsp;    That said, I think I'm going to simply start a new blog, one with an address that won't catch the attention of the rest of the school.&nbsp; I've been thinking about doing it since I found out exactly who reads much of what I post, but I figured that since this is the Internet, it's not like I can retract what I've said, even if I meant every word of it.&nbsp; It's banned at school anyway (blogger.com), so I don't really care what the reaction would be to ending this.&nbsp; Since this will probably be my last entry, I'll most likely save every entry in a folder (in a place few would think to look on my computer), so I can remember what I thought.&nbsp; Maybe someday I'll make a scrapbook out of what I wrote on here, but for now, I don't have any ink in my printer, so that's not an option for the time being.&nbsp;   To all the people at TD, read Shaheen's blog.&nbsp; It's not really like mine at all, but it's very entertaining, even though I have to go to dictionary.com a few times to figure out what she's saying.&nbsp; The address is  urlLink www.winkalink.blogspot.com  .&nbsp; To the sophomores who read (I'm fairly sure that no freshmen read this, especially since I personally know only about 20 freshmen out of 600), be prepared for junior year; if you balance your time and do your homework, you should be ok.&nbsp; (Yes that sounds like a teacher, but it's what helped me to survive the year, which really isn't so difficult if you manage your time well and not try to take on every challenging class.)&nbsp; To the juniors (now seniors!) who read, good luck senior year and with colleges.&nbsp; To the graduates who read it senior year, live it up in college.&nbsp; To the random people who read, um, have a nice day.
