						   This has been one weird week I was accepted to the graduate programme I wanted on thursday  and every day I've been wondering if I'll be able to make it over there, and that's what i've been wondering all week, then today one of my best friends informs me that he has been kicked out of the programme I wanted to apply to after finishing in barcelona, it's scary, I can't believe it's gone to that level, now I'm more woried than ever, it seems that we weren't prepared nearly as good as we should have been. and that means that I won't have a summer vacation because I'm going to have to kill myself to learn the math and economics I need not to travel that same road. Now I don't know if I should wait another year and do a math course here or simply take a chance. I'll think about it in the next couple of days and study like a bastard... I guess that's all I have

						   The weekend was ok, it could have been better. I slept for most of saturday and finally got out 5pm. Went to my grandparents place for a bit, came back to the apartment watched some tv and got some dinner. After that went for drinks with the guys and came back around 2am. On sunday I went to vote early with the grandparents and my uncle,then came back and went back to bed, i got up around 4pm for a game of ultimate frisbee, it was fun, we played 5 on 5 for about three hours even though it rained, the rain actually made the game better. We won 4-2 and after that got together at eduardo's place. On monday the results of the election came in, as everyone expected them to be, and uncle Jose passed away which ruined the day. Latter on I went out to dinner with stimps, ray and willy we grabbed a beer and went home.

						   Today was an interesting day,  instead of studying for retaking the GRE like I should be, I ended up wasting most of the day doing errands and watching movies with willie, jos√® and raymond,every time I see kill bill vol 1 it gets better. I really should start taking my studying more seriously, sometimes I feel like more than 15 minutes in front of a  textbook kill me. Tomorrow I will spend at least a couple of hours on that and math.  other than that I'm tired of all the politics here, seriously this country has been nothing more than an eternal campaign the last couple of months, it's incredible how this is going but hopefully I'll be out of here soon. Dinner at don nacho was weird my friends confronted me for being to negative all the time, they say i always see the negative aspect of everything and that they worry I might be depressive,I know I have my problems but things don't seem to call for that extreme.   other than studying I should see if i can get some soon, really it's not even funny anymore. Searching for perfection in a girl hasn't taken me anywhere, I don't know if my standards are to high or if I don't try hard enough but something has to be done about this.  I'll check in again tomorrow to see if i actually did anything of what I said. good night...

						   Sometimes you only come to terms with things when you see them happening before your eyes. I for once determined I'm never going out again if there isn't a girl included in some part of the equation. I couldn't stop feeling like shit, out of place, and not wanting to be there last night. I still can't figure out what they like of spending time like that, I would've rather stay at home, so next time I will. I'm just glad that all of this will be over soon. I can't help feeling like a looser every time I do this so it's not happening again.    Figuring out why Laurita bailed on my at the last minute is not easy but knowing that she's kinda nuts helps me not feel like all that rejected, though you can never lose the whole feeling. I doesn't make sense if you take into account that she was the one that originally asked me out, but I'll ask her what went on. In any case at least I won't be seeing her again in a while.

						   Not much new in the last couple of weeks, doing all the paper work I need to do before leaving the country. Yesterday I talked to my cousin erik and he told me I need to get my ticket asap, so I will call him tomorrow to do that.   I've been studying math for the last couple of weeks, and it's nice to se the proofs I do are right I should have a nice idea of what analysis actually is before the end of the summer. Also studied for the gre on friday and I guess it won't be hard doing it again because I still have it.  Classes are going ok, they could be more interesting, I finally understand metrics this time around and that's nice to know, also after class I talked a bit with Barbara, I've always have liked her and let's see what's her situation and what can happen there. Continuing in that line I've always wanted to go out with laurita and that has been closer than ever to happening but I always chicken out at the last moment and I don't know why, it's stupid because I thought I was over this kind of shit since april when I finally approached a girl without giving it too much thought but with her things seem to be different, I'll try to see if I finally go out with her this week, there's nothing to fear and anyways I won't be here for long so I have to do this.  It's been hotter than ever the last couple of days and you can't deny summer is finally here, not that there's any other season here but it's never this hot during the rest of the year, and the power outages don't help either, I haven't been too self concerned or depresive lately because I finally see an end to my life here, I can't wait to live in the city my forefathers had to leave because of a stupid dictator and learning more about economics and my roots, but I still have to wait a couple of months for that.  On another note I feel my group is breaking up, everybody is taking their own direction, except for Cesar who looks like he's going to Barcelona too, stimps is going back to his high school group and willie is with his party friends, I feel kind of bad about this but at the same time it was going to happen sometime and having nothing to do helps me study which aint half bad, I should study more though...  Anyways this is all for now, I'll post again next week
