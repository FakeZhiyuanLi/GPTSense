      We lost...again.  England has a way of getting your hopes up then crushing them at the last moment just when you're ready to celebrate.

      I am a fairly recent fan of Football (Soccer for those who insist on the North American verbage), but have become an absolutely rabid supporter of the English Premier League and England's national team.  With the game about to start, I can hardly contain my excitement (even if I am sitting in my cubicle at work).  Playing Portugal  in  Portugal will be a tough go, but I think they will do it.  Go England!

      Well, here's my first attempt at blogging which essentially means, all of the half started journals, memoirs, stories, reflections, etc. that I've never been able to complete will now be available for the whole world to see. Hopefully that will be motivation enough to actually finish them!   Although my interests range from books, to music, to film, to politics, most of the content you'll find here will be tinged by&nbsp;faith as well. Just like a small drop of food colouring in a tall glass of water, my faith permeates all that I am. Don't worry - even though I am heavily involved in my own Conservative, Evangelical Christian world, I believe that life - all of life - comes from God so I try not to tie my blinders on too tightly.   Essentially, that's why I chose Rumours of Glory as the name of this blog. Aside from the fact that it's a great Bruce Cockburn song, it also encapsulates how I understand the world around us. In all of life, if you are just willing to stop, look around, and listen for a moment, you'll find evidence of the divine everywhere; the 'Strong Hand of Love' as one songwriter put it.   The rumours are true! Let's take a listen together...

      No real plans on this long weekend so I'm just doing some DIY projects around the house and listening to the radio.  Right now there's a show on CBC 2 called  urlLink 50 Tracks , with four panellists choosing what they feel are the top 50 songs on the recorded music era by decade (today they are in the 1950’s).   Now, I consider myself more knowledgeable about popular music then your average person on the street, but I’ve never even heard of some of these tunes!  I know music preferences are a deeply personal thing but Mel Torme over Elvis?  Hank Snow over Johnny Cash or Patsy Cline?  I don’t think so!  So, your assignment is to leave me a comment about what you believe are the most essential songs or artists in each decade from the 1950’s to the 1990’s.  This is a  urlLink good site  if you need some help.  I love a lot of the music prior to the 50’s but to keep this easier, let’s just consider the last 50 years.

      Although it was a bit of a whirlwind tour, we had a great vacation in the Maritimes and we discovered where we would like to visit again and where we wouldn't bother with.  Prince Edward Island is absolutely gorgeous on the North Shore and is perfect for a week of relaxing on a beach.  We only had a couple of days camping, but next time we'd rent a cottage for a week, stay on the beach, and not bother visiting the cities/towns.  Cavendish is great, but Charlottetown and Springfield were a little disappointing.  Nova Scotia is great too and Halifax is my favourite city in the world.  Gorgeous harbour area, plenty of history, lots happening, friendly people, and a pace of life that is so much more sane than here in Ontario.  I don’t even have the right words to explain my affection for Halifax.  It goes beyond words to my very soul.  When I am there, all is right in the world.  When I have to leave, a piece of me stays behind just waiting for my next visit.   Lunenburg is a beautiful little town filled with colourful houses, maritime antiques, and artisan shops.  We're not talking your mom's ceramic garden gnomes here; we're talking truly amazing works of carving, glassware, and folk art.  We will definitely visit again – hopefully when the sun is out!  Port Royal used to be the capital of the province back in the days before the British forced the Acadians to leave.  Although I didn’t take many photos, it’s a picturesque little town that was a perfect spot to spend our last night before heading home.  A number of the B&B’s and shops are owned by people who fled the rest of the country for a more sensible life.  As one person put it, “I was sitting on the 401 in rush hour traffic and just thought, is this really worth it.  I visited Nova Scotia and didn’t ever want to leave.”  She and her husband moved permanently a year later.  They now officially qualify as "CFA's - come from away."  But now we are home and it feels good too.  No matter how great it is to visit other places, there is always something wonderful about being in your own bed in your own home.  It makes me think of the longing in every human heart for heaven.  Whether it is recognized as such, we all have a desire for "home", that place where we will find our ultimate comfort, peace, and rest.  Thanks for enjoying this little trip with us.  I hope someday you’ll be able to visit this part of our country too and discover just how amazing it is!

      My apologies for not posting in so long.  I was away at a publisher sales conference, then to the Christian Booksellers Convention in Atlanta, and then on vacation with R to the Canadian east coast.  I now have a digital camera that R and I took on vacation with us.  Is there a greater invention known to man than the digital camera?  I don't think so.  Sure, I can fly around the world, I can drive across the continent, I can use indoor plumbing, but as tough as that last one is to beat, the digital camera has changed my life!  I took 169 photos on our vacation to Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.  I have always taken lots of photos but I've never felt so free to just shoot away and not have to worry about film and processing charges.  While we haven't developed any shots yet, just knowing we can pick and choose the ones we really want is a huge bonus!   I'll post some of my favorite shots here shortly as well as a little more commentary on the actual trip.  For now, let me just say that if you haven't visited the maritime provinces, do it now!  This is some of the most beautiful country in the world, and some of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet (except maybe for the drivers in New Brunswick!).

      This is an old news item from AP but i just came across it for the first time and I had to pass it along...  SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- In the matter of Drusky versus God -- God has won. A Pennsylvania man's lawsuit naming God as a defendant has been thrown out by a court in Syracuse. Donald Drusky, 63, of East McKeesport, Pa., blamed God for failing to bring him justice in a 30-year battle against his former employer, the steelmaker now called USX Corp. The company fired him in 1968, when it was called U.S. Steel. "Defendant God is the sovereign ruler of the universe and took no corrective action against the leaders of his church and his nation for their extremely serious wrongs, which ruined the life of Donald S. Drusky," the lawsuit said. Drusky wanted God to return his youth and grant him the guitar-playing skills of famous guitarists, along with resurrecting his mother and his pet pigeon. If God failed to appear in court, federal rules of civil procedure say he must lose by default, Drusky argued. But U.S. district Judge Norman Mordue threw out the case earlier this month. Mordue ruled that the suit -- which also named former U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the major U.S. television networks, all 50 states, every single American, all federal judges, and the 100th through 105th congresses as defendants -- was frivolous.  And we wonder why there's a backlog in the legal system!

      Bill Clinton was in Toronto yesterday signing copies of ‘My Life’ for thousands of adoring fans.  According to an exclusive media report, “he was even giving out hugs!”  I bet he was…  Anyway…I would fall on the conservative side of the voting spectrum (although I try to be open to the strengths and weaknesses of all parties), however, Clinton was interviewed for the CBC last night and he made a really good point about the U.S. involvement in Iraq.  I’m not getting involved in that debate right now, but he asked the question why, after September 11, was the tracking down of Bin Laden/Al Qaeda not a priority?  Why did Saddam Hussein suddenly become public enemy #1? And why were the Pakistani’s left to hunt for Bin Laden with only 10,000 US troops for support while there are 130,000 in Iraq where there are no WMD’s?  All good questions I say.  If you want a good laugh, go to  urlLink JibJab  for a great video that takes shots at both sides!  A couple of weeks ago at a worship concert, Brian Doerksen said that it was his opinion that God had specifically called Canada as a nation to be a peacekeeper to the rest of the world.  I had never thought of us in that light and it gives me a whole new perspective on the military and what our role in the world is as Canadians.  Although I still believe our military deserves more federal funding, it needs to be as a support to our peacekeepers around the world to equip them in their role, not to bolster our military might.   New offensive weapons – no.  Helicopters that don’t crash 10 minutes after lift off – yes.

      Since it probably won’t get a lot of press anywhere else, I thought it important to note the passing of one of the early masters of photography, a pioneer of modern photojournalism, and one of my favourite photographers.   urlLink Henri-Cartier Bresson  was a true purist in that he refused to use anything other than natural light and believed in capturing "the decisive moment."  In his own words:  “’Manufactured’ or staged photography does not concern me. And if I make a judgement, it can only be on a psychological or sociological level. For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity and the master of the instant, which questions and decides simultaneously. In order to "give a meaning" to the world, one has to feel oneself involved in what he frames through the viewfinder. This attitude requires concentration, a discipline of mind, sensitivity, and a sense of geometry.  To take photographs means to recognize both the fact itself and the rigorous organization of visually perceived forms that give it meaning. It is putting one's head, one's eye and one's hearth on the same axis.  As far as I am concerned, taking photographs is means of understanding, which can not be separated from other means of visual expression. It is a way of shooting, of freeing oneself, not of proving or asserting one's own originality. It is a way of life.”  Is photography art?  Yes.  It is art observing life which, in many ways, itself is an art form.  Bresson was a master at both.
