        Upgrades Galore  I upgraded to Blog*Spot Plus and Blogger Pro. When I went to HaloScan to get the code again, I found they're having problems with their servers. Soooo...no comments 'til at least tomorrow sometime! Go figure!

        "I Gotta Bad Feeling About This...!"  OK...something big and nasty happened to the old STG sometime earlier today. The HaloScan comments feature hasn't been working for a few days, so I went in and re-entered the HaloScan code from their website. POOF! The whole thing was g-o-n-e! To quote that great theologian, Baloo from Disney's  The Jungle Book , "gone...solid gone!" So I'm re-doing it. Let's see what happens now!

        Tough Day. Long Day.  Nothing in particular made it a tough, long day. Just one of those draining kinds of days. It's not the fact that there were only 3 people at our mid-week service...after all, I learned a long time ago that you don't measure someone's commitment to Jesus by the number of hours per week they spend inside a church building. I guess I'm simply discovering that it's going to be more of a spiritual battle than I imagined. I mean, after all, here we are in the very buckle of the Bible Belt! This is the county where First Baptist! Woodstock! is located! This is where the big guns come to hang out! But the powers of darkness are there and here and everywhere! The most powerful one may be that of apathy...  Oh, well. It seems that everything I post is kind of a downer. Maybe that's the way it is...

        More of That Francis Schaeffer Quote  My friend, Chad Canipe (Hey, Chad, will you be my friend?) posted more of that quote from Francis Schaeffer over on his website...   "The Bible is clear here: I am to love my neighbor as myself, in the manner needed, in a practical way, in the midst of the fallen world, at my particular point of history. This is why I am not a pacifist. Pacifism in this poor world in which we live—this lost world—means that we desert the people who need our greatest help.  Let me illustrate. I am walking down the street and I come upon a big, burly man beating a tiny tot to death-beating this little girl-beating her-beating her. I plead with him to stop. Suppose he refuses? What does love mean now? Love means that I stop him in any way I can, including hitting him. To me this is not only necessary for humanitarian reasons it is loyalty to Christ's commands concerning Christian love in a fallen world. What about that little girl?  If I desert her to the bully, I have deserted the true meaning of Christian love-responsibility to my neighbor. She, as well as he, is my neighbor.  We have, in the Second World War, the clearest illustration anyone could ask for on this point. What about Hitler's terrorism? There was no possible way to stop the awful terror in Hitler's Germany without the use of force. There was no way. As far as I am concerned, this was the necessary outworking of Christian love in the fallen world as it is. The world is an abnormal world. Because of the fall, it is not what God meant it to be. There are many things in this world which grieve us, but we must face them.  We never have the luxury of acting in a merely utopian way. Utopian schemes in this fallen world have always brought tragedy. The Bible is never utopian."

        Some Random Thoughts on the Eve of a Necessary Action   "To secure peace is to prepare for war."   -Karl von Clausewitz      "We are going to have peace even if we have to fight for it."  -Dwight David Eisenhower    "The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the peace that comes with healing in its wings; with compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this Earth to choose their own destiny."   -Richard M. Nixon   "If peace is equated simply with the absence of war, it can become abject pacifism that turns the world over to the most ruthless."   -Henry Kissinger    "You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom."   -Malcolm X    "Even peace may be purchased at too high a price. "  -Benjamin Franklin

        What’s the difference between a community and a mob?  Great question...great answer!   "The whole notion of 'community' is a vast, fuzzy semantic and political swamp. But I think people in communities know each other and have relationships. People in mobs don’t necessarily have those relationships."

        urlLink  Great Stuff from Todd Hunter     "In the neutral zone we can often wonder if we are going crazy or experiencing enlightenment as we unlearn old self-images and take on new ones. The old is now transparent (what it really was-- good and bad), but nothing new feels solid yet.  In the neutral zone we learn to surrender, to give in to the process through trusting God, inviting God to act. Though we fear this may lead to chaos, the chaos envisioned here is not a mess; it is like a primal state of pure energy--God’s kind of energy--that leads to God’s kind of creation. It is only from the perspective of the old form that chaos looks fearful—from any other perspective it looks like life in the making, soon to be shaped by new purpose and identity."

        Finally! A Reasonable Counterpoint to the Prevailing Whining!   "From my own study of Scripture I would say that to refuse to do what I can for those who are under the power of oppressors is nothing less than the  failure of Christian love.  This is why I am not a pacifist.  Pacifism in this poor fallen world in which we live - this lost world - means that we desert the people who need the greatest help."   -Francis Schaeffer  For more, check out  urlLink antithesis.com

         urlLink I Gotta Bad Feeling About This - Redux !  I'm no military expert. I don't even play one on TV. I'm not so sure about this war business though. I thought - maybe naively - that we'd be a little closer to achieving our objectives by now. Just a hunch, a gut feeling - totally uninformed, of course - but it seems to me if it goes on like this much longer, we're going to be in a real quagmire that we can't easily get out of. If we're going to lay siege to Baghdad, as some seem to think, and not go in and take it swiftly, we're setting ourselves up for a whole new slew of problems. Then what are we going to do? Just pack it in at the end of a long, drawn-out campaign, and say, "Oh, well. We didn't really mean it this time, either. Thanks for playing. What's the consolation prize for the Iraqis, Johnny?"   I hope not.   I pray not.   If we are setting out to liberate the Iraqi people from an evil dictator, let's do it. If not...well, if not, why did we start something like this in the first place?  Just some random thoughts on a Friday night...

        Talk About Straddling the Gap!  Read what  urlLink this guy  has to say about the tension between the two kingdoms believers are experiencing. Check this great quote...   "We should certainly support our leaders. We should pray for them an understanding that they have been positioned to rule over us for good and not for evil. As a democratic society we are free to voice our concerns and convictions related to our country's actions. However, our thinking and our speaking must be tempered by a biblical understanding of humanity, God, and salvation.  Such Christian thinking within the contexts of personal living, global conflict, and eternal redemption helps us realize in the end that God's favorite colors are not red, white, and blue. Rather, like we used to sing, indeed they are red and yellow, black and white."

        The Gap is Wide...and Expanding, I'm Afraid!  Yesterday, I talked about fellowship, connecting with the Body of Christ, belonging, etc. I made the statement that we in the "modern" church world focus almost primarily on "going to church." That is, we measure faithfulness by how often/how long you are physically in the building. I used Andy Stanley's great illustration of "sitting in rows, looking at the backs of other people's heads" and how the New Testament doesn't emphasize that. At the conclusion of the service, one of our ladies came by and said, "I guess I won't see you Wednesday, since we don't have to come to church anymore, huh?" I said something like, "Don't come if you've got some real ministry to do. That would be a whole lot better!" I'm not so sure she "got it" - or even wanted to.

        Handshakes and Hugs All Around!  What a day! After a full day of Stonecrest, I went to a church "down the road" to participate in a "revival" service along with the choir and musicians from my former church, First Baptist Chattahoochee. It was old home week, for sure! Nice to know someone misses you and acts like they care about you. Good service...remembered how much I love just getting up there, opening the Word, and letting it fly! No PowerPoint to fool with, no image thing, no nothing...just preaching! Harks back to a bygone era, I know, but it's kind of in my blood!  Winter has returned here..at least for a day or so!

         urlLink Same Old Bad Feeling - Different Source   Christopher Ruddy writes...   "More than seven days into our new war and the Washington Post is now citing Pentagon sources that this war may last months.  Such a conclusion may be premature.   But still, the war effort seems stalled and the U.S. is entering the most dangerous phase of the war as we approach Baghdad.   Confidence has been replaced with uncertainty, and a cloud of worry looms with the possibility the Iraqis may use weapons of mass destruction.   I am not in the anti-war crowd or among the naysayers who want to see doom and gloom. I do believe in straight shooting. I believe an honest understanding of our situation is not bad news. It is good news – only if we have a realistic appraisal can we win quickly."

        More Great Reading About How One Church Transformed Its Community  Check out the story of this Jacksonville church in  urlLink "Wizard of Odds."   These quotes jumped out at me:   "The key to any successful ministry is obedience. Jesus was obedient unto death, even death on the cross. He's our example. Obey. No matter what it looks like, you obey. Obedience is better than sacrifice, and God has honored our obedience."    "A local church ought not just drive in on Sunday, have an hour-and-a-half of preaching and singing, and then leave. If you're in a community, then you ought to affect that community.  I ask other pastors, "If your church were to leave the community you're in, what impact would that have? Would they miss you? Would they weep?" I think our community would miss us if we weren't here. I hope they would. We have built relationships with the people of our community and with retailers in hopes of saving this community. That kind of networking can save a community.  We are the community."    "I talk to a lot of pastors who are applying for grants and all this kind of stuff. I say to them, "You don't need a grant now. You need the ministry first."  In other words, you need to target the ill of your community. Identify the greatest need, then motivate your people to attack that need. You don't need a building first, but a burden.  A pastor first needs a burden for a specific need in a specific place. When you have a burden, you'll begin to change things, and people will join you in that work."

         urlLink Jordon Cooper's  Next Home Run Quote/Allusion  He always...I mean always has something thought-provoking in his blog. He posted this little gem while describing his church board meeting:   "One of the things I brought up was something that Janice McKinnon wrote in her book and that was that in trying to save an institution or a way of life, we often end up destroying it because we don't allow it to change as it needed to. We all thought the same could be said about the church."   I have seen this in action. We all have!

        urlLink   Deep Change  by Robert E. Quinn   Re-reading one of my favorites! Quinn writes...   "What we fail to see is that our success by the old formula is like a map that has guided us to the edge of known territory. We cross a line into new territory and when we try to apply our old map there, strange and frustrating things happen. We get into a vicious cycle. We continue to explore our new and problematic territory with an old map, and that makes our problems worse. Our certainty that our old map must work drives us into a state of great pain and frustration. Only when our pain gets excruciating are we willing to humble ourselves and consider new actions that might allow us to successfully progress in our new situation."  pg. 66.

        We "Professionals" May Be Focusing on the Wrong Thing Entirely  Read what  urlLink Todd Hunter  has to say...   "But, the people I most admire and respect in life are not focused on “church” as a place, event or thing. They just quietly participate in non-descript churches and submit themselves to be used by God, to be ambassadors of his Kingdom in those communities of faith…as everywhere else in there their life: no dualisms. That attitude—whole life self-surrender—is rooted in a different kind of life: life from above, eternal life. It is what we must pursue for our selves and those we serve. It will make most models work.   But again this does not mean we abandon our pursuit of better models. It means that models are second; spiritual transformation is first, in community, for the sake of the world."

        Starbucks Ahead of the Curve Again!  Today I stopped in Starbucks on the way home from running a couple of errands, and as I was leaving, I saw a poster in the window, advertising employment opportunities. Here's what it said:   "Create community. Make a difference in someone's day."  What an awesome concept! We have the opportunity in the church to create a community that will make a difference in someone's life for eternity...and their life today! We really ought to be as serious about it as the Starbucks folks. Don't you think?

        Maybe We're Finally Getting It!  Baptist Press reported on  urlLink a group of Baptists in Texas who previewed  Mel Gibson's upcoming movie  The Passion . Here's what one pastor said:   "I have preached the cross for 33 years. The movie is everything I could ever convey with words and more."    If it's true that we live in a visual, image-oriented world, even the most "isolated" among us had better come to grips with the power of those images. Maybe, just maybe, we'll continue to learn the "secret" of Jesus' prayer for His disciples -  "in the world, but not of the world."  Insulated. Not isolated.  As Leonard Sweet has said:  "In the world, not of the world. But not out of it, either."

        What About That Monument in Alabama?  Are we going to Hell in a handbasket? Is this world and this culture slipping further away from God?     urlLink John Piper   reminds us that this world and this culture are already antithetical to the Kingdom of God.   "Being Christian exiles in American culture does not end our influence; it takes the swagger out of it. We don’t get cranky that our country has been taken away. We don’t whine about the triumphs of evil. We are not hardened with anger. We understand. This is not new. This was the way it was in the beginning –- Antioch, Corinth, Athens, Rome. The Empire was not just degenerate, it was deadly. For three explosive centuries Christians paid for their Christ-exalting joy with blood. Many still do. More will."

        What I  urlLink Read  Today!    "Make a careful exploration of who you are and the work you have been given, and then sink yourself into that. Don't be impressed with yourself. Don't compare yourself with others. Each of you must take responsibility for doing the creative best you can with your own life."    "For my part, I am going to boast about nothing but the Cross of our Master, Jesus Christ. Because of that Cross, I have been crucified in relation to the world, set free from the stifling atmosphere of pleasing others and fitting into the little patterns that they dictate.  Can't you see the central issue in all this? It is not what you and I do - submit to circumcision, reject circumcision. It is what God is doing, and he is creating something totally new, a free life! All who walk by this standard are the true Israel of God - his chosen people. Peace and mercy on them! Quite frankly, I don't want to be bothered anymore by these disputes. I have far more important things to do - the serious living of this faith. I bear in my body scars from my service to Jesus. May what our Master Jesus Christ gives freely be deeply and personally yours, my friends. Oh, yes!"    - Galatians 6:4-5; 14-18  (The Message)

        What  urlLink One Guy  Learned About Being Christian on a Sidewalk in Front of the Supreme Court    "I learned two huge lessons at some point that night. The first was that as Christians, we have to be educated in our faith. We’ve heard it before: Always be ready to give an answer. Christianity is only effective if you can communicate it at the most basic level of society—down on the sidewalk level. We should be so consumed with Jesus Christ that we can engage others in a discussion of our faith at any given moment. When we are down “in the streets,” we need to be able to articulate our beliefs in a persuasive way—not throwing around moral judgments or using Bible verses as bullets—but to represent Christ and the power of his love.   Being able to give an answer for our faith involves more than knowing the Romans Road. It necessitates a Christian worldview so that we can articulate our faith when discussing cultural, political and moral issues. What do you think about the Middle East conflict? About euthanasia? About the Academy Awards? About sodomy laws? If we want a relevant voice in our culture, we have to be able to intelligently discuss these issues from a Christian perspective.   Even more important than this, if we want to change the culture and impact other people, we have to be prepared for personal relationships. We can try to represent Christ in the protest line, from the pulpit or in litigation, but the Gospel is best spread through personal relationships and one-on-one contact. Christ shared His unique message of God’s love and forgiveness in His daily contact with other people: He ate with tax collectors and sinners; He blessed the adulteress and the child."

        A Great Opening to a  urlLink Good Article About One of My Favorite Places!     "Two things strike you when you walk into the DeKalb Farmers Market. Not just strike you, but reach out and grab you: the smell and the cold.   Jayshri Joshi doesn't notice the smell anymore -- that fecund overload of fish guts and wet mops, of mangoes with their memory of the tropics, of chickens roasting and samosas frying. Of cheese, of meat, of half-sour pickles and of people. People riding forklifts and people pushing buggies with drowsy children inside. People sitting in dark, lonely corners stocking boxes of pasta, and people raking their fingers through the cool promise of Georgia green peanuts, looking for the tiniest and sweetest to surface in the pile."   The  urlLink Dekalb Farmers Market  is truly something to experience...especially if you fancy yourself a "semi-chef" like I do!

        One of Those Days...  Don't really know why, but today has really stunk! Ever have one of those days?  Started off OK...ordered the new toys...both from Dell, one is the  urlLink Dimension 4600  and the other - for Andrew ("the boy!") is the  urlLink Inspiron 8500 . Bunch of money, but what the heck...  Anyway, kind of went downhill after that...  Got to the office, the carpet is still damp! The musty smell is starting to go away - after 2 bottles of Febreze! It's still not a pleasant place to hang out right now, though. Worked on my library some. Finally getting some sense of organization on the shelves.   Had a hassle with the re-fi guy over some documents that he already has, but can't find. I just don't know if it's worth the hassle for the little bit of relief we're getting.   Finally managed to find Albert Camus'   urlLink The Stranger   for Andrew. Seems every high school senior English lit class must be reading it this semester.  Highlight of the afternoon - finding Alton Brown's new   urlLink Gear for Your Kitchen   at Barnes & Noble, and having one of the best Frappuccinos I've had in a long time!  I don't know...I guess I'm just kind of fed up with being expected to take care of everyone else's problems. I know that goes with the territory and all, but it just seems a little overwhelming today!

        "A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever"   So wrote "my man"  urlLink John Keats . But, it's not always that way.  Tonight, on the way home from our midweek service, I decided to flip over to the classical  urlLink public radio station . The show "Adventures in Good Music" hosted by  urlLink Karl Haas  was just starting.   He called this edition of the show something about "tonal colors" or something, and was describing a driving trip through Oregon while listening to the Larghetto movement of  urlLink Beethoven's Second Symphony . He said he wanted his listeners to share in that experience, so he played the piece. Right in the middle, he started doing a "play by play" analysis of the music. This lasted through the Beethoven and into Tchaikovsky's great  urlLink Marche Slave . Man! I couldn't believe it!   Then it hit me...this is exactly what the Sweets, Martoias, Webbers, and others are talking about when they try to show the difference between modernity and the time we find ourselves in now. Rather than experiencing the power and beauty and emotion of the music, I found myself distracted by the incessant "explanation" of it. Could this be a parallel to the "talking head" version of "worship" that we've become accustomed to? Could it be that it would be much more powerful if we could hear the music of the gospel, rather than be distracted by some commentary?  Just a thought on this Wednesday evening. You've got yours...

        Synchronicity and Why Blog? (Part Deux)   Tim Bednar (see my blogroll...yeah, over there on the left!) just posted this on Chad Canipe's comment section (yep, it's over there on the left, too!)...   "I came to the conclusion--its not the need for an audience as much as a calling out for community. When I blog, I write myself into existence and call out for community. Google (and the concept of blog rolls) is becoming the postmodern 'Roman system of road' that connects us with one another in ways never previously imagined."

        Why Blog?   Here are some interesting comments that I found while searching for information on blogging for a totally different reason.  urlLink Rebecca Blood  has this to say about the effects of blogging...   "Shortly after I began producing Rebecca's Pocket I noticed two side effects I had not expected. First, I discovered my own interests. I thought I knew what I was interested in, but after linking stories for a few months I could see that I was much more interested in science, archaeology, and issues of injustice than I had realized. More importantly, I began to value more highly my own point of view. In composing my link text every day I carefully considered my own opinions and ideas, and I began to feel that my perspective was unique and important.  This profound experience may be most purely realized in the blog-style weblog. Lacking a focus on the outside world, the blogger is compelled to share his world with whomever is reading. He may engage other bloggers in conversation about the interests they share. He may reflect on a book he is reading, or the behavior of someone on the bus. He might describe a flower that he saw growing between the cracks of a sidewalk on his way to work. Or he may simply jot notes about his life: what work is like, what he had for dinner, what he thought of a recent movie. These fragments, pieced together over months, can provide an unexpectedly intimate view of what it is to be a particular individual in a particular place at a particular time.  The blogger, by virtue of simply writing down whatever is on his mind, will be confronted with his own thoughts and opinions. Blogging every day, he will become a more confident writer. A community of 100 or 20 or 3 people may spring up around the public record of his thoughts. Being met with friendly voices, he may gain more confidence in his view of the world; he may begin to experiment with longer forms of writing, to play with haiku, or to begin a creative project--one that he would have dismissed as being inconsequential or doubted he could complete only a few months before.  As he enunciates his opinions daily, this new awareness of his inner life may develop into a trust in his own perspective. His own reactions--to a poem, to other people, and, yes, to the media--will carry more weight with him. Accustomed to expressing his thoughts on his website, he will be able to more fully articulate his opinions to himself and others. He will become impatient with waiting to see what others think before he decides, and will begin to act in accordance with his inner voice instead. Ideally, he will become less reflexive and more reflective, and find his own opinions and ideas worthy of serious consideration. His readers will remember an incident from their own childhood when the blogger relates a memory. They might look more closely at the other riders on the train after the blogger describes his impressions of a fellow commuter. They will click back and forth between blogs and analyze each blogger's point of view in a multi-blog conversation, and form their own conclusions on the matter at hand. Reading the views of other ordinary people, they will readily question and evaluate what is being said. Doing this, they may begin a similar journey of self-discovery and intellectual self-reliance.  The promise of the web was that everyone could publish, that a thousand voices could flourish, communicate, connect. The truth was that only those people who knew how to code a web page could make their voices heard. Blogger, Pitas, and all the rest have given people with little or no knowledge of HTML the ability to publish on the web: to pontificate, remember, dream, and argue in public, as easily as they send an instant message. We can't seriously compare the creation of the World Wide Web itself with the availability of free technology that allows anyone with a web browser to express their unique, irreproducible vision to the rest of the world...can we?"

        Unseen, Unknown Friends  One of the cool things about blogs is that there are so many folks "out there" who are doing them. Yeah, yeah, I know...they all start to look alike. But through these little pieces of themselves, I find people who seem like they'd be very cool to hang out with. Who are sharing some of the same joys and struggles. Who are thinking about the same things.

        Suburban Spirituality  I had intended to post the Christianity Today article by the same name, so I decided to find it in its entirety. As I Googled, I came across this quote in a book review somewhere...   "Many Christians today have what some sociologists of religion have called a 'suburban spirituality': we like our religion neatly trimmed, safe, gated, and above all respectable. As a consequence, fewer and fewer of us are willing to take chances - much less, God forbid, risks - for the sake of the Gospel. Little wonder that some of the folks most ardently working for peace and justice have a healthy distrust of Christianity."   Anyway, here's the  urlLink whole article ...

        "Of course I'll be back. I have to manage the All-Star team."   urlLink So says one Jack McKeon , improbable 72-year-old manager of the improbable World Series champion Florida Marlins.  Now, I didn't care much about baseball after the Braves couldn't...well, you know....  But, you've gotta love ol' "Trader Jack." Gotta hand it to him. Kind of refreshing, in that "only in America" kind of way. The rumors had already started about another Marlins "fire sale." About McKeon heading back to the farm. Blah blah blah...  I say good for Jack McKeon! Maybe some other managers - no names, please - could teach a bunch of improbables to play with passion. Hey...it has happened before!

        I Don't Need to Blog!  Of course,  no one  needs   to blog, you say! So, what's up?  What's up is I read lots of other blogs, and those folks have lots of stuff - good, bad, or otherwise - going on in their lives. Important stuff. Cool stuff. Tragic stuff. Heavy stuff. Poignant stuff. I'm just poking through life, one day at a time, and thinking, "having a blog is very cool." But then not posting anything is kind of stupid...  Seems I only use this space to "stalk" other folks' blogs, wishing I could be as "important" as they are...  Looks like it's going to be one of  those  days...

        The Care and Feeding of the Inner Designer/Creator  I know some amazing creative people who are masters of design. I asked some of them these questions one day:   "What do you do to 'feed' your 'inner designer?'" "How do you stimulate your creativity?"  "What are some resources that might help us 'non-designers' get 'better' at it?"  So, in response to some of their repsonses, I'm doing some things...  Right now, I'm in the middle of reading Michael J. Gelb's    urlLink How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day        And one of Gelb's chapters lists some of the "great music" that has inspired and developed creative people over the years. I've always been a music lover - music of all kinds - but since starting the Gelb book, I've been on one of my "classical" kicks. Right now in my CD player are these five new CDs...  Stravinsky's    urlLink The Rite of Spring     Mahler's    urlLink Symphony No. 6 "Tragic"     Mozart's    urlLink Requiem     Brahms'    urlLink A German Requiem     Richard Strauss'    urlLink Four Last Songs     Great recordings!

        Somebody's Been Inside My Head and My Heart  Doing a little "blog-stalking" tonight. Got a lot of stuff on my mind. I came across this - really by accident - over at the " urlLink community blog " at  urlLink Water's Edge .    What I Want...    I want to see God’s kingdom come and his will done in my life and in the lives of all the people around me.  I want to be the wheat, not the weed. I want to be the good tree. I want to be attached to the vine, bearing good fruit. I want to be able to say, as Peterson puts Paul’s words to the Galatian believers, “Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not "mine," but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”  I want to love my wife like I’m supposed to.  I want to love other people like I’m supposed to. I want to  smoke what I'm selling  (thanks Rob). I want the people around me to find wholeness and goodness in life. I want to be less critical and more loving. I want to be less concerned with what people think of me and more concerned with actually being helpful. I want  to see churches actually helping people to follow Jesus instead of warehousing them  (thanks Todd). I want to see churches use money more biblically. I want to see churches give an offering rather than receive one—just one Sunday! I want to see pastors rethink their roles so that they are helping people live as disciples of Jesus. I want to see churches let their pastors do that. I want  to see pastors stop competing against each other and start working together---or at least cheering each other on when they do well.  I want  to see churches get past the us-for-us and us-against-them mentality in regards to other churches and start thinking kingdom.   I want to see pastors allow discipleship to set the trajectory for their churches (thanks John). I want to see people discover that discipling others is not just for ‘paid staff’.  I want to see people reject the lifestyle of consumerism. I want  to see myself reject the lifestyle of consumerism.  I want to see pastors stop getting discouraged by the people who don’t show up. I want  to stop being discouraged by the people who don’t show up  (thanks Dallas). I want  to get over myself.  I want to see pastors pour themselves into the people who do show up. I want  to pour myself into those who do show up . I want  to see what Jesus will do with a whole community of people who will place themselves unreservedly at his will.  I want  to see what Jesus will do with me when I do it.  I want to see people who have been burned by churches turn their pain into creative love. I want  to see churches be known for inexplicable forgiveness.   Is this asking too much?

        Pretty Ominous Words from General Franks  General Tommy Franks (US Army, Retired) is the man who led the campaign in Iraq. In  urlLink this interview  he talks about the possibility of terrorists acquiring - and using - weapons of mass destruction against the United States, and what that would mean for our way of government and our way of life.  He also talks about President Bush and other matters.  But the words that got to me were these:   "Franks ended his interview with a less-than-optimistic note. 'It’s not in the history of civilization for peace ever to reign. Never has in the history of man. ... I doubt that we’ll ever have a time when the world will actually be at peace.'"   One day, General Franks, one day...

        Just Let Thanksgiving Be Thanksgiving!    I found this quote on  urlLink a review  of the Windham Hill   urlLink Thanksgiving   CD.   "Aww, poor Thanksgiving. It's been reduced to Christmas' bridesmaid. I believe the only people who celebrate the day most untouched are elementary school teachers and their students. Today it's a day alot of times to eat and then plan which store to hit at 4am (ok, I'm a hypocrite, I do that too)  If your town is anything like mine, you'll know that Christmas decorations are available to buy by the middle of June.  Now I love Christmas as much as the next person, but lately I just want Thanksgiving to be Thanksgiving ."   Kind of interesting...

"Talked about Zaccheus today......His salvation occurred when he stood up and declared that he would return fourfold all that he had defrauded from people.  His discipleship began the next day when those people began to show up on his doorstep looking for their money!"  WOW!

         Galatians 3:1-5  (The Message)     "You crazy Galatians! Did someone put a hex on you? Have you taken leave of your senses? Something crazy has happened, for it's obvious that you no longer have the crucified Jesus in clear focus in your lives. His sacrifice on the Cross was certainly set before you clearly enough. Let me put this question to you: How did your new life begin? Was it by working your heads off to please God? Or was it by responding to God's Message to you? Are you going to continue this craziness? For only crazy people would think they could complete by their own efforts what was begun by God. If you weren't smart enough or strong enough to begin it, how do you suppose you could perfect it? Did you go through this whole painful learning process for nothing? It is not yet a total loss, but it certainly will be if you keep this up! Answer this question: Does the God who lavishly provides you with his own presence, his Holy Spirit, working things in your lives you could never do for yourselves, does he do these things because of your strenuous moral striving or because you trust him to do them in you?"

        More Good...No,  Great  Stuff from PostModern Pilgrim!  One of the "new' blogs I've linked to is PostModern Pilgrim. Check out  urlLink what's posted over there  now.  I like these "necessary" things a witness needs to remember...   ~~ Work in a Team.  Don't ever go it alone. Paul always had others with him and picked up more people on the way.   ~~  Live with the people.  In the old mission days the missionaries lived in the Big House or the special place, locked and gated, a refuge from the heathen world they were trying to convert. Today we all need to live with the people to learn their language and culture and needs, not what we impose on them.  ~~  Share both the Gospel and your life.  In other words, don't be aloof, but be a servant with the people.  ~~  Set an example- in other words- disciple others.  We all do it. We are always setting an example, so what is it you are going to share? Do you live like you believe- truly believe what you are saying is true?  In all of this never forget that God is present at all times in words, the Word, and Power.   And then these thoughts on the difference between recruiting members and making disciples...       ~~ When you recruit members you are trying to bring people in.    ~~ When you recruit disciples you are trying to send people out.    ~~ Members are for us and our survival.    ~~ Disciples are for others and for God's Kingdom .   After a long, long day yesterday...and "money (or lack thereof!) finance meeting last night at church...I needed these thoughts today! Actually, it would've been better if I had them at the meeting last night. There's just something so... cheesy and manipulative  about trying to get people "in church" just so "our financial problems can be solved."

        "The Boy" Is Alive...and Going to CNN's Crossfire This Afternoon  I  urlLink posted earlier   today that "The Boy" is in Washington, DC, and that we hadn't heard from him since Friday. Well, not even an hour went by and he called from the bus on the way to the Supreme Court. (I told him he must have logged on, just to read my blog...that's how he knew to call. But he denied it.*)  Anyway, the trip going well, and they are scheduled to go the taping or live presentation of  urlLink CNN's Crossfire  this afternoon at 4:30 Eastern time. He didn't know - and neither do I - if it's live or taped for later airing.  NOTE: I just found out that Crossfire is on live at 4:30 p.m. ET.   So, there you have it.  *Contrary to popular belief, teenagers   do  , in fact, miss their folks when they are away.

        Monday Morning!  "The Boy" is off in Washington, DC with a school group. He's staying  urlLink here . (What do you want to bet it doesn't look like this picture with four high school senior guys staying there?!?!)  One good note: The Willard is so close to the White House that the US Secret Service is in charge of its security arrangements. The teacher sponsoring the trip reminded the parents - and the students! - that everything...  everything!   is monitored and videotaped by the Secret Service!  Today's itinerary includes the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, lunch in the Senate cafeteria, Capitol Hill, and a nighttime tour of the District.   Oh, and we've heard from "The Boy" exactly ZERO times since he left on Friday! But we haven't heard from the Secret Service either, so I guess all is well!  And just in case "The Boy" has logged on somewhere in DC, the Chiefs lost to his mom's alma mater in the high school football playoffs last Friday night.

        From  Ten Steps to Breaking the 200 Barrier   Introduction, "Break the Barrier?"  "...the realities are that growth, evangelism, and the expansion of the church depends as much on a leader's ability to develop an expansive infrastructure as on any other factor  except prayer . The ability to organize to meet people's needs is more important than creativity in program design."   Step 1, "Examine Your Motive"  "Why do you want to break the barrier? Unless the motive for growth is to proclaim the Good News to those who are lost and see them saved by the power of Christ, you will be working from an inadequate motive."

        Re-reading an Old Favorite  I've begun re-reading Bill M. Sullivan's  Ten Steps to Breaking the 200 Barrier . I got this little book "way back" in 1989 or so. It's been sitting on my shelf for a long time. Now, I'm aware of the perceived "shortcomings" of the church growth "movement." And I understand that, in today's culture, there is a trend toward smaller, more intimate, less institutional expressions of "church." But I also understand - and appreciate that in my tribe, in this location, the primary understanding is still the church as a cultural institution.  I'm wondering about the practicality/wisdom of trying to "impose" something new without a critical mass to see it through to fruition. Yes, the goal - primary and ultimate - is to develop maturing believers with a radical commitment to Jesus and His Kingdom. But there has to be some pool of people to draw from.  To me, the 200 level seems about right. There's enough people to do the things that are "expected" of the church. Yet, it's small enough to foster and encourage intimacy in the fellowship. I'll be posting some insights from Sullivan's little book as I go.

        Holiday Party?  OK, OK! I admit it! I want to go to a holiday party!   Not one of those"all-church" put-on-a-happy-sappy-face, Rudolph-and-Santa-and-Frosty-sweaters, Christmas-tree-socks kind of affairs. I mean a party!   Where people dress up. Stylish. Classy.   Where good conversation and good food abound.   Where people aren't trying to impress others with how "holy" they are.   I mean a gathering that's just about having a big time.   I mean where the kind of stuff on the Starbucks "A Merry Affair" CD is playing in the background. Where Diana Krall wishes me a merry Christmas. Where Charles Brown tells the world he'll be home for Christmas. Where Ray Charles tries to convince Betty Carter that it's cold outside. Where Mel Torme offers a simple phrase to kids from 1 to 92. Where Jim Brickman and George Winston back up a gourmet dinner.  Real glasses. Real china. Real silver.  No plastic cups. No paper plates. No throwaway utensils.  Cool little hors d'oeuvres. Festive little toothpick thingies.  Where candles sparkle. Where the tasteful Christmas tree twinkles.   A grown-up Christmas party, I guess.   Where real laughter is heard.   Where I steal a little "smacky-do" standing under the mistletoe with my wife. Where she looks like a million bucks in a little black dress.   OK, pinch me! I guess I'll make do at the church-wide brunch this Sunday!

        "There is a saying that the church should be two feet outside the gates of hell. We set it up two feet inside."  I saw this story about  urlLink God's Rolling Thunder  in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   They meet right down the road from us, and a couple of our folks have started attending there.  Interestingly, some of our other folks are a little "put out" with this expression of "church."   Maybe it's because the God's Rolling Thunder bunch is making a real diiference, without all the pretense. Just a thought...

        Lusting...  My wireless phone contract runs out soon, and I'm looking at options. Maybe like this...  urlLink      But I'm reminded of what a couple of people have said in regard to PDA's. One said, "I'd love to have one, but I'd probably lay it down somewhere and forget it." Another said, "I can't even remember to write down stuff in my Day-Timer. Why would I want to pay that much for something I won't use?" But perhaps my favorite PDA-related comment is:    "Why do I need one of those? I've got my wife, she knows everything in the world, and comes with automatic reminders!"    Good call!

         urlLink Charlie Hall  in the CD Player Tonight...   "Lord, high and holy, meek and lowly, Thou hast brought me to the valley of vision, where I live in the depths but see thee in the heights; hemmed in by mountains of sin I behold thy glory.  Let me learn by paradox that the way down is the way up, that to be low is to be high,               that the broken heart is the healed heart,              that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit,              that the repenting soul is the victorious soul,              that to have nothing is to possess all,              that to bear the cross is to wear the crown,              that to give is to receive,              that the valley is the place of vision.   Lord, in the daytime stars can be seen from the deepest wells, and the deeper the wells the brighter the stars shine; let me find thy light in my darkness, thy life in my death, thy joy in my sorrow, thy grace in my sin, thy riches in my poverty, thy glory in my valley."

        OK...Almost Back to "Normal" After Christmas...  Tonight I went to our friendly local  urlLink Barnes & Noble  to spend a little Christmas gift card! I had a long list of books and CD's from my Amazon.com Wish List that I was going to use as a "guide" to spending the gift card.   Well, as it turned out, I forgot to take my list, and the ones I could remember weren't there, so I ended up picking up  urlLink The Michael Feinstein Anthology .   Yeah, yeah, so I know all about him.   But the man can sing the American standards, and this collection is pretty awesome! Right now, he's doing a super rendition of Gershwin's "They Can't Take That Away from Me," you know the one...   The way you wear your hat  The way you sip your tea  The memory of all that  No, no, they can't take that away from me   The way your smile just beams  The way you sing off key  The way you haunt my dreams  No, no, they can't take that away from me   We may never, never meet again  On the bumpy road to love  Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of   The way you hold your knife  The way we danced till three  The way you changed my life  No, no, they can't take that away from me  No, they can't take that away from me   Ah, Gershwin! Very cool!

        "Send the Ones Nobody Else Wants"  I was going through some old journal entries yesterday, and I came across some notes I had made last year while re-reading Dick Wills'    urlLink Waking to God's Dream   . In the section about his daily prayer practices, Wills wrote that he prays for God to "send him the ones nobody else wants."   WOW! What a powerful prayer! Most of us - yep! I said "us" - are looking for the ones that can do the most for us, the ones who will "contribute" to our lives and our ministries.   Now, I know that  somebody's  got to reach the "uppers." Somebody's got to carry the message to the "somebodies."  But I've got a sneaking suspicion that if we aren't willing to find the "downers" and the "somebodies-who-just-don't-know-it-yet," we won't have many opportunities to reach out to anybody.   God, send me the ones nobody else wants. And help me recognize when they're standing right in front of me. Not so I can be "relevant" or "trendy" or "emerging" or whatever. But so I can "contribute my verse" to the "powerful play" that is Your work in the world.

        Haunted...Unpacked a Little  A couple of days before Christmas, I dropped  urlLink this little post  about the "Christmas Ghosts" into this space. I mentioned a "Christmas Ghost" that Mr. Dickens didn't know about...The Ghost of Christmas-That-Never-Is-What-You-Think-It-Will-Be. The night I wrote that, I didn't feel much like saying any more about it. So, here we are, two weeks after the fact, and here's what I meant...  First, it ought to be a law that any school personnel only get one week off for Christmas...um, I mean...winter break! That's about the maximum amount of time she can stand it! We all seem to do a lot better when we have our "regular" routines.  Second, there's really nothing like using your "Christmas money" to catch up on normal, run-of-the-mill expenses. That kind of stinks!  Third, it ought to be another law that teenagers have the Christmas spirit at Christmas at least. The "one-week" law (see above) ought to apply to them as well.  It just seems that we get all worked up preparing for Christmas, or some idealized version of it, and then the reality sets in, and it's a letdown by the time it actually gets here.  Oh,well, I guess we're just disgustingly normal, huh?  By the way, the saddest place/time in the world? Wal-Mart's Christmas section, December 27. The second saddest? Starbucks, without the eggnog latt&egrave; or the Christmas decorations, etc., January 5.

        How Do You Say “latté” in French?   urlLink Starbucks comes to Paris!   The king of Frappucinos-to-go nevertheless accepts it may not be easy to make ends meet right away in a country where people still like to sit down to drink their "express," preferred short, black, bitter -  and above all, cheap.   "Our success in other countries does not provide us with an entitlement to be successful in France," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told The Associated Press.  Research has shown the French remain skeptical about "whether coffee from America can measure up," Schultz conceded, but they are aware of the Starbucks brand - and "their curiosity will drive them into the stores."

         urlLink Keith Drury is Thinking. And Writing About It!     "For instance I’ve been thinking that my greatest mistake has been theological—I’ve not fully grasped the importance of the church.   I’ve been a true “man of the enlightenment” in emphasizing individuality… personal relationship with Jesus Christ, a personal walk with God, personal devotions—to the exclusion of the corporate elements of Christianity.  I’ve got to think more on this before writing, but I’m increasingly thinking that there is no such thing as just a “personal relationship with Jesus Christ” apart from a relationship with the church.   I know, I know—this sounds incredibly Catholic. But I’ve been wrong to ignore the central role of the body of Christ in the life of a real Christian—not just to helps Christians be better people or to be a locker room for real life outside the church, but I’m increasingly pondering the thought that there is so salvation outside the church.  I’m fed up with a world charmed by Jesus who reject the church.  But the world’s dismissal of the church is not my central concern—but Christian’s dismissal of it."

        Possible, Huh?  A  urlLink Russian scientist has done his homework  and determined that the Exodus account of the Red Sea crossing is "possible."   "The mathematicians calculated the 'strong east wind that blew all that night' mentioned in the Bible needed to blow at a speed of 67 miles per hour to make the reef, said Volzinger, who specializes in ocean phenomena, flooding and tidal waves.  'It would take the Jews -- there were 600,000 of them -- four hours to cross the 4.2-mile reef that runs from one coast to another. Then, in half an hour, the waters would come back,' he said.   The Egyptian army that followed them drowned in the sea.   'I am convinced that God rules the Earth through the laws of physics,' Volzinger told the Times."

        Just Wondering, part dos...  Today, the old MyDoom thing hit my wife's workplace. After the fact, the "tech person" (you know, the one who gets paid to handle such things?) sent this e-mail across the entire network...   "Everyone is receiving a ton of email – either from people you know or don’t know.  If the subject line is not English, or just a bunch of letters that don’t spell anything or you have received an attachment named test.zip, test.bat, text.zip or text.bat simply delete the email and then empty your deleted items.  If you are concerned that you may have a virus – do the following  Click on Start -> All Programs ->Symantec Client Security->Symantec Antivirus Client  Click on Scan Computer on the left side of the screen, then click on Local Disk C: (it will have a check mark)  Click Scan  If the scan completes with no virus found, you are ok.  If you have a virus, please contact either {the other tech person} or I."   I knew about MyDoom. I'm a pastor, not a tech geek. I knew what it was going to do. The tech person apparently wasn't even sure what was going on until I sent my wife the info on MyDoom. Oh, the instructions they gave for cleaning it didn't work. In fact, a later e-mail said something to the effect of "please do not go into Norton to try and clean this up."  I'm not real sure why that whole episode has me thinking...but it does! Go figure!  Oh, yeah...it's a school!

        "A Thousand Deaths That No One Can See"   urlLink Jordon Cooper  is everyone's favorite Canadian.   Well, at least it seems that way. Just about every blog I read has a link to Jordon's excellent blog!   Early this morning, I found this  urlLink powerful piece of punditry over there...    "I tend to lead by assumption that people get the big picture, give a lot of freedom, and let them work it out. The problem is that most people don't get my assumptions and a couple months later that no one really cared about the ideals that I thought were so important and I don't like what it has turned in to. Gloria reminded me that idealists are often lonely. Of course we are beause it hurts us each and everytime our ideals are sold in for the pragmatic solutions that undermine them. It's even worse because it isn't evil people that sell out your ideas, they are your friends and people you trust. That is what makes it worse.  It is easier to withdraw and keep the ideas to yourself than it is to share them and see them die a thousand deaths that no one can see except yourself."     I know exactly what he's talking about. Makes you wonder about the clarity of your vision and the power and validity of your call. You hope that, at some point, somebody will "get it," and you won't have to keep on knocking yourself out.

        Graphic Grace: Quick Notes on "The Passion of the Christ"  Just got back from taking our students to see the Mel Gibson movie. A couple of thoughts...  Graphic violence? Yes. Intense? Definitely. Distracting? Nope. No matter what you've read in the media, the film does not go as far graphically as it could have. I guess seeing it in pictures is more graphic than reading about it in the Bible, but the Bible's words are much more brutal and graphic - especially when you factor some of the prophetic passages.  More striking to me than the graphic violence was the "graphic" grace! Especially in the scene with Malchus in Gethsemane, Mary Magadlene's "flashback," and the thief on the cross. Also, Simon of Cyrene's scenes are pictures of Jesus' grace and mercy.  Most impactful of all? To me, the sheer willingness and determination of Jesus to complete the task of redemption!   Oh, and I was pleasantly - and powerfully surprised with the resurrection at the end, since I had not heard that the film went beyond the crucifixion.   A couple of things...the "subtle" inclusion of icons (like the Shroud of Turin, for instance), and that weird "demon child/old man" that the Satan character (masterfully portrayed by a woman, BTW...OK, OK, nothing inferred or implied by that!) carried toward the end of the crucifixion scene...what was up with that?  All in all, a powerful presentation, from my vantage point. Your mileage may vary...

        Loneliness...  From Donald Miller's  urlLink   Blue Like Jazz   , page 173...   "Loneliness is something that happens to us, but I think it is something we can move ourselves out of. I think a person who is lonely should dig into a community, give himself to a community, humble himself before his friends, initiate community, teach people to care for each other, love each other. Jesus does not want us floating through space or sitting in front of our televisions. Jesus wants us interacting, eating together, laughing together, praying together. Loneliness is something that came with the fall.  If loving other people is a bit of heaven then certainly isolation is a bit of hell, and to that degree, here on earth, we decide in which state we would like to live."

        "The New Face of Church in America: A Tool of Satan?"  I'm reading Donald Miller's    urlLink Blue Like Jazz   . Now I know that I'm an old geezer at 43, but some of Donald Miller's book sounds like "I'm writing this because I want you to know how cool I am." I may be way off-base, but that's the way some of it reads to me.  Having said all that, there is some pretty good stuff in the book. I just finished reading this passage, on page 111:   "A friend of mine, a young pastor who recently started a church, talks to me from time to time about the new face of church in America - about the postmodern church. He says the new church will be different from the old one, that we will be relevant to culture and the human struggle. I don't think any church has ever been relevant to culture, to the human struggle, unless it believed in Jesus and the power of His gospel."   Now, look at his next couple of sentences...   "If the supposed new church believes in trendy music and cool Web pages, then it is not relevant to culture either.  It is just another tool of Satan to get people to be passionate about nothing."     Passionate about nothing. Passionate about  nothing?  Passionate about   nothing!    We talk a good game, when we talk about our passion. Our passion for reaching the culture. Our passion for being relevant. Our passion for making a difference. Our passion for  whatever....   Does our -   does my   - passion lead me to be passionate about the things Jesus is passionate about? Is my passion full of action that really costs me something? Or is my passion empty words and clanging cymbals?

        A Journal Worth Putting My Thoughts In  Van Gogh used it.    Matisse had it.   Picasso sketched in it.   Hemingway wrote in his while the afternoon sun of Paris filtered over his shoulder.   Now, I've got one! I wish I had had one when I was encouraged to "begin the 3 x 5 habit" back in school. It's the perfect tool for keeping up with those 3 x 5 thoughts, and other stuff. It's a handy size. It fits in my pocket. It has a "secret compartment" in the back. Oh, and it looks cool and gives me the feeling of capturing important stuff in a long line of creative people - which I hope to be - when I grow up.   It's a  urlLink Moleskine !

        One of Those 80s Movie Music Moments...  Just now, in my dusty old (2 years old!) "Excellent 80s" soundtrack CD, the powerful and poignant Kate Bush ballad "This Woman's Work" from the Kevin Bacon/Elizabeth McGovern film    urlLink She's Having a Baby   , is playing. I'd forgotten how much that song - and that movie - made me "wipe a little dust from my eyes." The Music from the 80s Movies website says this about the song...   "An amazingly powerful ballad that plays as Kevin Bacon waits to find out if his wife and baby will survive a breech birth; You get to see a montage of the birth, their parents, and Jake (Kevin) sitting alone with tears in his eyes as he suddenly realizes what's really important in life."   It's as powerful to me right at this moment, listening to it, as it was when I saw the movie 15 years ago!  Maybe I'll post about why it is that way to me...

        There's a New (Café) Kid in Town!  Had a chance to visit the newest neat place in Olde Towne Woodstock, Georgia today -  The Serene Bean!  Homemade biscotti, a great, GREAT cappuccino, WiFi, meeting rooms, wonderful-smelling clam chowder, and lots of good-looking pastries, sandwiches, etc. About 35 cents cheaper than... urlLink well, you know ! And the coolest part? The  urlLink coffee cup sleeves  with very neat art on them!  I heard - through our resident "grapevine" - that the owner said she was going to give... urlLink well, you know ! a run for their money, at least locally! Right now, she's got my vote! I've been waiting for a local café to come along that's worth supporting. This is it! I hope she makes it!  Oh...I still love... urlLink well, you know ! My secretary is still part-time there, and she, being pregnant and all, is not drinking caffeine. So, I'm the beneficiary of her  urlLink "free pound a week"  or whatever. OK...if you won't tell her I'm going somewhere else, I won't either! Deal?

         urlLink In the Ghetto...   Nope, not the Elvis song! I hear these horror stories about the  urlLink Christian ghetto    "where sanitized saints...separate from the world and keep safely out of its way."  Sometimes, I'm not sure what to make of them. But today, I had my own "ghetto experience," and it was kind of comical and a little tragic at the same time. Here's the deal...  I was looking for a "slimline" version of the Bible to tuck into my briefcase, so I headed off to  urlLink our local ghetto . I headed over to the Bible section and began to look around at all the different translations and versions and editions (Yes, the US Marines, Little League coaches, and women executives all have their own edition...go figure!). Anyway, I had decided to get either a    urlLink New Living Translation    or    urlLink The Message: Remix   , depending on which one was the thinnest and took the least space.  I found an   NLT   that was just about perfect, except I didn't really want it in black (I know, picky, picky!). I also found a hardcover edition of   Remix  . I gathered these two and headed over to the customer service counter to ask if there were any others beside the ones on the shelf.  The very nice, very friendly woman said, "No, what's out is pretty much what we have. Maybe you missed some in that section. Let's go take a look!"  OK, I thought. Maybe I  did  miss some. She took the two I had in hand and off we went!  "Why are you looking for these particular Bibles?" she asked. Then this...  "You do know  this one  (holding up   The Message: Remix  ) is just somebody's paraphrase, don't you?"  "Yes, ma'am," I replied.  "Well, why do you want this particular one?" she asked again.  "Because it has the verses marked in it," I said.   She had that disgusted kind of look, and then put it back on the shelf! Holding the black   NLT  , she said, "And this one...well...this one...um...this one is not a word-for word translation, you know. If I were you, I don't think this one would be my first choice. Do you have a good English study Bible?"  I tried to conceal my laughter. "Yes, ma'am, I actually have several good English study Bibles. I'm looking for one to stuff in my briefcase."  She wasn't through yet! "Well, you really ought to re-think  these  Bibles, because they aren't as  literal  as some of the others. They kind of stray away from the  usual  text. I'd just hate to see you get something that doesn't have the  right language  in it."  At this point, I don't know which was annoying me more - her condescension toward the   NLT   and   The Message  , or the fact that the salesperson was actually trying to talk me  out  of a purchase!  So I did what every self-respecting annoyed pastor would do, I guess. I said, "Thanks for your concern, but when I really, really want to check out the right language, I break out my Hebrew and Greek editions. I'm just looking for a Bible in one of those translations that won't take up a lot of space in my briefcase."  She put the black   NLT   back on the shelf, and picked up a "gift and award" edition of the    urlLink New King James Version!    "This may be more what you're looking for," she said. I thanked her, and said I'd just take the black   NLT   after all.  We got to the counter, and of course, she asked if I had a "Perks" discount card. I pulled my "Pastor Perks" card out and I thought her jaw was going to drop! Literally! She started backpedaling and stammering and apologizing profusely! As though it was OK for me to get something "different" since I was one of the "anointed" or something.   Anyway, pretty funny to me...  Guess I should stick to  urlLink my "own" ghetto  from now on. Naaah...don't even get me started there!

        "Just a quiet, sad little place for quiet, sad little people."   I haven't read much of N.T. Wright's stuff, but the more I see, the more I'm convinced I probably need to get a little more familiar with his stuff. I found  urlLink this quote  tonight (Thanks,  urlLink Jordon !) and this is what I'm afraid of - in my own life and in the life of our church...   "Meanwhile the Church, like so many of its older buildings, seems to be saying to the passer-by: 'Not much happening here. Just a quiet, sad little place for quiet, sad little people.'"

        Tonight I'm Thankful...  ...for the people who lift me up! I just came home from one of those long personal confrontations that have to happen from time to time, and I put  urlLink Josh Groban  in the CD player. In shuffle mode, the second song that came up was  "You Raise Me Up,"  and I realized how blessed I am to have people who will - from time to time - gently get in my face and help me me get "over" myself!   I know some people think it's cheesy and all that, but tonight, these lyrics are kind of hitting home...   "When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;  When troubles come and my heart burdened be;  Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,  Until you come and sit awhile with me.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be."

          Powerful Stuff from Donald Miller's     urlLink Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance   ... “I have, in the training of the church, acquired the proper language, the gestures, the utterances of Scripture which carries a young man to his perceived success. I am ‘a fine young man,’ ‘an anointed child.’ God’s hand is ‘on me’ and He will ‘use me to do great things.’ All of this swells the head and develops a lust for more and more. I read C.S. Lewis and quoted him in a Bible study. I was then asked to lead the next study, having been thought an intellectual by my contemporaries. So I read more of Lewis, and of Paul Johnson and Calvin Miller, and then finally elevated to Kipling, Herbert, and Thompson. This branded me as more than literate; I was an appreciator of beauty and of the higher elements in life. All this in complete contradiction to the truth. I rarely felt what I read, only reading to pull quotes and have it appear I resonated with such noble ideas. Still, pushed by my contemporaries, I precipitated further into the ranks of church culture. Having developed an ability to communicate with a degree of drama and insight, I was acquisitioned as a staff member. I led a college group and taught twice each week. Twenty-one being an early age to bear such responsibility, my aspect was that of leader, but my heart was empty. I led, not in obedience to God, but for the reward that comes with the position: the comments and the looks and the shaking of hands and admiration that accompany a ‘man of God.’”  “I was the one who was asked to pray when eating lunch with friends.  I was asked advice on subjects I had never thought of nor experienced. I studied, not for the joy of learning, but to pass myself off as a man of books. I read and memorized lengthy passages of Scripture, not for the feeding of my soul, but that I might repeat them in public.  Upon analyzing my behavior, I became despondent. In the midst of knowing about God, the very being I studied, to me, was evasive, was invisible, was no one I knew.” (p. 77-78).    “My knowing God will not come through convincing others that I know Him, it will come in seeking, in the effort and in the joy that increase with my familiarity of His goodness.”   (p. 78-79).

        Other Voices...Lost Opportunities  Found this in  urlLink a great discussion  over at    urlLink Worthwhile   ...   "If you ever took Latin, you know that voice and vocation share the same root. Your voice -- or who you are at your essence -- sometimes screams and sometimes whispers, but it always tells you what you should do with your life.   That was obvious when we were eight years old; what we wanted to be when we grew up was what we most loved to do or think about. But as years passed, other voices drowned out our own ."

        Some Thoughts on Writing...Maybe They Can Be Transferred to Blogging?  I just finished Donald Miller's    urlLink Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance   . I know, I know...I blogged about it a couple of weeks ago! I should have finished it way before now, but I didn't. So sue me!  Anyway, at the end, in the "acknowledgements" section, he talks about some guy who challenged him to "write a page a day." I Googled for  urlLink "one page a day,"  which led me to Roberta Jean Bryant's    urlLink Anybody Can Write   .  She talks about starting and using a journal to hone your skills for writing. She challenges to write a page a day. At the end of the article, she says...   "Write honestly. Risk nakedness. Originality equals vulnerability.  I like what Jessamyn West says about being a writer: "To be a writer, you have to first stick your neck out and take a chance and then be willing to make a fool of yourself and give yourself away." A journal provides a safe place to practice doing just that.      A journal is a place to detail all the little happinesses and document all the large delights of your unique life. A place to have fun. And a place for magic. Magic happens when one engages in regular and long-term involvement with oneself in words on paper. Journals need not be grim or boring. Expressing the joys of your life, appreciating what's good today, playing with ideas - all are potentially magical."   I think she could be talking about bloggers, except bloggers kind of hope people will find their blogs. I guess, don't you?  Imagine the potential (but probably not the reality!) of millions of people - some you know, some you don't know; some close by, some halfway 'round the world - reading the stuff you thought was important enough to throw up there. You do have to stick your neck out a bit and make a fool of yourself.   I used to enjoy writing, just for the sake of writing. I never had any grand illusions (or is that delusions?) that I was any good at it. I just knew I enjoyed it. I remember writing a silly little poem called "The Turkey from Albuquerque" when I was in about the second grade. I don't have any clue now what the New Mexican turkey did. I just remember writing it.  I remember "publishing" the "Odd Sane Dog," a pencil-driven newsletter for third-graders.  I remember in the seventh grade, getting published for the first time! The  urlLink SBC    Youth A   Sunday School quarterly published my poem "Behold the Man." Woo hoo! Big stuff!  I remember writing a screenplay - of sorts, based on George Orwell's    urlLink 1984    for a video project in my senior year in high school. (Oh, did I mention I acted in the film, too? Yeah, cool!)  I remember finding the two errors in the college-writing exemption test. As I took it. The summer before my freshman year.  I remember getting the job as the assistant news editor at my  urlLink college paper . I remember the first time my byline appeared. I even got a check for that bit of writing.  I remember sitting in the shoe store in the mall, on slow days, writing about "Christopher Michael Sinclair" in my version of the next "Great American Novel." Uh huh, right.  To write truly is to stick your neck out, to risk being laughed at, humiliated, or worse, ignored. To blog is, in my mind, much the same thing. What starts out as being "cool," or "the thing to do," ends up lighting the fire, or stoking the embers, whichever is the case.   I'm going to commit to "a page a day." Here and/or in the ol' Moleskine. We'll see what happens...

        "Grow Old LOUD!"  One of my "redneck pastor" buds,   urlLink Ken Bob  , reviewed his trip to last weekend's  urlLink Music Midtown . A couple of his comments really stood out to me...   "Music Midtown is one big missionary field confined by 10ft fence!"    "It was hilarious to hear twenty somethings say, 'These guys are insane!'  All I know is I heard the bell ringing cause those kids were gettin' schooled on what rock and roll is!!!"   And this one...   "I made a commitment this weekend to grow old LOUD!"   To grow old LOUD! What a powerful concept! I don't want these years to pass by without making a mark for the Savior! I don't want to be the "old coot trying to be cool," but I don't want to be the "old coot just content being the old coot" either.   Kind of reminds me of Sunday night's little talk from  urlLink Romans 13...    "But make sure that you don't get so absorbed and exhausted in taking care of all your day-by-day obligations that you lose track of the time and doze off, oblivious to God. The night is about over, dawn is about to break. Be up and awake to what God is doing! God is putting the finishing touches on the salvation work he began when we first believed. We can't afford to waste a minute, must not squander these precious daylight hours in frivolity and indulgence, in sleeping around and dissipation, in bickering and grabbing everything in sight. Get out of bed and get dressed! Don't loiter and linger, waiting until the very last minute. Dress yourselves in Christ, and be up and about!"   Oh, here's what Ken Bob looks like when he's growing old LOUD! Ah, the transforming power of Music Midtown!

        Good Rules to Live By  I'm right in the middle of a message series entitled   "Real Reality,"   based on Ephesians 4 - 6, and using some of the "reality TV" shows as themes. Yesterday was    urlLink Newlyweds    and I talked about marriage, using Ephesians 5:21-33, I came across the    Contemporary English Version   translation of  urlLink verse 21 ...    "Honor Christ and put others first."    That pretty much became my outline about marriage, and I said it could be the best two rules I know of for any personal relationships. I went on to say that all the major problems in my marriage (coming up on 20 years' worth this June 30!) have happened as a result of neglecting one or both of these  principles.   I want to put these simple rules into practice in my marriage, my ministry, and all of my life!

        Leave It At the Stream: Letting Go of the Past, Focusing on the Future  I love  urlLink  Fast Company   magazine. I picked up one of the very first issues back around 1996, when I was doing a doctoral seminar project on change and leadership. I've been hooked ever since!  Found  urlLink this great article  over there.  urlLink Marshall Goldsmith  talks about his concept of "feedforward." Face it, most of us have enough critical, negative feedback about things we can't do anything about. Goldsmith urges us to focus on what we can change in the future.  Goldsmith's ten reasons his "feedforward" concept works...   We can change the future. We can't change the past.  It can be more productive to help people be "right," than prove they were "wrong."  Feedforward is especially suited to successful people.  Feedforward can come from anyone who knows about the task.  People do not take feedforward as personally as feedback.  Feedback can reinforce personal stereotyping and negative self-fulfilling prophecies.  Face it! Most of us hate getting negative feedback, and we don?t like to give it.  Feedforward can cover almost all of the same "material" as feedback.  Feedforward tends to be much faster and more efficient than feedback.  Feedforward can be a useful tool to apply with managers, peers and team members.    Seems like a thing we "Jesus apprentices" ought to do,  urlLink if we're going to be like our Boss.

        "Life Once Removed"  Found an  urlLink interview with Carol Burnett  in which she talks about the differences between comedy on TV now and in her heyday. the interview includes this little exchange between Ms. Burnett and Larry Gelbart   Ms. Burnett recalled having a conversation several years ago with Larry Gelbart, the veteran comedy writer. "I told him how predictable TV sitcoms were: set up, set up, joke, laugh track, set up, set up, joke, laugh track. And he said: `Carol, the writers today didn't play stickball in the street. They're writing about what they saw on television when they were growing up.' " Ms. Burnett said, "They're writing about life once removed."

        Today Has Been a Good Day for Thinking!  My early-morning blogging session kind of set the tone for the rest of the day. I got to my office and discovered that my secretary had a doctor's appointment. We're in the middle of changing phone companies, so the phone's not ringing a whole lot. The maintenance crew did their usual Friday gig on Thursday for some reason. So, I put some  urlLink Charlie Hall  and  urlLink David Crowder  in the old CD player, ground some  urlLink Komodo Dragon  for the coffeemaker, and had a great, uninterrupted! day of thinking, praying, and studying.  Besides working on Sunday's talk (finishing my "Real Reality" series, "What Not to Wear," based on  urlLink Ephesians 6:10-18 , here are some things that crossed my mind, entered my heart, and made their way into the Moleskine. (No certain order, just random, may develop them more later.)    “Peter Pan” Christians:   What do you do with believers who refuse to grow up?    Loving God with all that I am:   PASSION, PRAYER, INTELLIGENCE, ENERGY, according to  urlLink Mark 12:28-34 .    What was it about Jesus that made Him such a magnetic, compelling leader?   What made His disciples – especially the early ones – follow Him without prior knowledge? - The testimony of John the Baptist. They were already following John – and he pointed Jesus out to them. - Their own curiosity. If John said such amazing things about Jesus, what did he mean? - Jesus’ call to follow. “Come, follow me.” “See for yourselves.”  - Spending time with Him. - The promise of a new kind of life. Not necessarily an easier life. A life that would require a new set of skills and a willingness to learn.  urlLink “Fishing was their regular work.”  Their new life would be “kind of like” the old life, but different.    Leading those who are someone else’s followers.   (Thanks to Todd Hunter, from some un-updated blog somewhere on the Web! Just kidding...!) If believers are to be disciples following Jesus – and I’m called to lead them, how do I do that? It’s not me they’re called to follow ULTIMATELY! It’s HIM! But I’m supposed to be the guy who points Him out to them, like John the Baptist!

        Being the Church - "Emerging" or Otherwise - Across Cultures?  So much of the conversation I read/hear is about the "emerging" church. And too often I tend to see what's happening from my own little perspective.  urlLink Stephen Shields  lets us in on a conversation he's having with folks who are not from "our" perspective, when it comes to what being the church on mission is all about.  I particularly like these questions from  urlLink Matthew Glock , who lives in Paris, and is wrestling with what it means to be a Jesus-apprentice in that culture...   "Are we loving God with all that we are? Are we loving our neighbors as ourselves? Are we inviting people to join us in our journey? What are we doing that is tied to cultural norms that are not relevant those who are outside our community of faith and don't find their place in the Bible?"   Good questions, Matthew. Good food for thought this early Friday morning.

        WWKD?  What would Krusty do?  Seth Godin  urlLink writes about clowns  over in    urlLink Fast Company   .    1. Clowns ignore science.    "Clowns refuse to measure their results, because measurement implies that they accept the reality of the outside world. Wishful thinking is not a replacement for the real world. Only clowns can get away with that."     2. Clowns don't plan ahead.    "The only species that regularly demonstrates foresight is humans, but we manage to do this only on occasion. People are happy to spend themselves into credit card debt to enjoy today (instead of tomorrow and the next 30 years), and they work hard to maintain the illusion that everything is just fine--until it's not."     3. Clowns overreact to bad news (and good).      4. Clowns aren't very nice to each other.    "Why is it so unusual to find a company where the boss cares for his employees? Why is it even more unusual still to find a workforce where teamwork just naturally overcomes selfishness? Why do we focus on takeover battles, high-profile firings, and attack-dog politics instead of the gradual, inexorable progress that happens when people with a shared goal work together to accomplish it?"   I love this line...  "What would Krusty do? Or Chuckles? Bozo?  Figure out the behavior of a real clown - and do the opposite. "

        The Incredible Power of Setting Goals  Ever know people who seem to get virtually everything they want out of life? You know the ones, the ones who are always achieving the next thing on their list.   urlLink This neat little post  over at    urlLink Worthwhile    says the list may just be the catalyst for achieving the things on it!    "Can success really be as simple as a list, a notebook, a collage, whatever it is that moves an idea out of the ether and closer to reality? Goal-setters and fly-by-seats-of-pantsers: what's given you the things that make you as happy as that screaming soccer announcer?"   I wonder how many of us really sit down and determine what's most important in our lives, and then expend whatever energy it takes to make those things a reality.  I spent part of today with one of these guys, I think. What I like so much about him is that he knows what he believes God is calling him to accomplish. Others around him say it can't or won't happen. Others around him say he's too arrogant to think about things the way he does. But he has a goal, and a plan to reach that goal! I don't know if he has a list, but he's making progress.

        A Quick, But Unscientific Study of Bloggers  In an earlier post, I mentioned the what-I-think-is-rather-cool feature of Blogger called "Next Blog."  A little while ago, I was sitting, drinking a cup of tea, and playing around with the Next Blog thingy. Here are some discoveries...  There are a lot of  young , I mean really young bloggers out there!  There are a lot of  foreign ...um, "international", excuse me, PC crowd...bloggers out there!  There are a lot of both of those kinds of bloggers that  I can't understand . Because of the "international" language - and the, shall we say, "not so polite" language! I know, I know... everybody  talks that way, and they don't necessarily mean to be profane or foul-mouthed. (Yes, I have an 18-year-old son, with 18-year-old buddies!) I'm not really shocked, just interested, I guess.  There are a lot of  hopeless and cynical  bloggers out there. Now, that may just be a characteristic of our times and our culture. But it seems that the doors are wide open... urlLink the fields are ready to harvest  if we can find some meaningful ways to engage them, even in, especially in their hopelessness and cynicism.  There are a lot of  interesting  bloggers out there. I mean, people are literally blogging about every imaginable subject. And some that aren't even in the imagination of lots of people!

        Where Dreams Go to Die  I found an old CD of the late, great Harry Chapin I'd burned back in the "free Napster" days.   Most of his songs are powerful and poignant, but one in particular grabs me in these days. It's  urlLink about the cleaner from Ohio  who loves to sing and is encouraged to give it a shot on the professional stage. He's the best singer in Dayton, but it's an entirely different story when he goes to New York for his big debut. In one succinct review, Mr. Tanner's dreams are shattered, and his life is sucked out of him.   He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends. Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again, Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed. He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes. Music was his life, it was not his livelihood, And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good. And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul. He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.   Ever feel like that?

        Out of the Big Box Church and Into the Real World  Did you catch this quote from Alan Roxburgh via  urlLink Karen Neudorf  via  urlLink Jordon Cooper ?   "Our culture does not need any more churches run like corporations; it needs local communities empowered by the gospel vision of a transforming Christ who addresses the needs of the context and changes the polis into a place of hope and wholeness."   Kind of reminds me of  urlLink the story  where Jesus gathers His disciples together and, walking through the communities among the people, He tells them to pray that God would send harvesters into the ready fields. The  urlLink very next verse ...He sends the disciples themselves out into that world!  I've been kind of discouraged about our church folks' response - or lack of response - to our annual Vacation Bible School. But, in the middle of my discouragement and disappointment, God is opening up a door for us to move out into our ready harvest! We're taking the show on the road to a nearby trailer park, where there are some real needs. Exciting!

        Farewell     "We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for 8 years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.  And so, goodbye, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."  -President Ronald Reagan,   urlLink Farewell Address

        Joe College, Day 1  I mentioned earlier that "The Boy" is now a college freshman. Today was his first day.  He ran into that age-old dilemma, "How long do you have to wait if the professor doesn't show up?" It was the first day of his second class, and no professor! Ya really gotta love that!   Anyway, he stayed in the classroom (surprise!) and actually did his homework from the other class! (Big, big surprise!)   Oh, he got a "date" out of the deal, too. For coffee at Starbucks. With an "older" woman. (She's all of 19 - a sophomore! Robbing the cradle already!)  I'm reminded of this other Joe College...uh, Joe COOL...

        Busted!  OK, so I'm not taking a perp walk with my head bowed down and my jacket covering my handcuffs. They didn't seize my computer - although there may be some "incriminating" data on there. I'm not on some post office bulletin board somewhere, but I may be busted just the same.   urlLink Chris Monroe  wonders if there are too many "emerging church voyeurs" out there...   "In fact, for the last 2-1/2 years, I've become increasingly concerned about the growing number of Emerging Church Voyeurs --  men and women who are fascinated with this emphasis, this paradigm, this movement -- but who persist in "watching" others instead of rolling up their sleeves and getting personally involved.  In some instances, they are people who lurk anonymously around EC-related message boards. In others, they're the host of people who join book discussion groups and attend workshops and conferences, but never launch out themselves.  The Emerging Church experience, for these folks, is tantalizing, titillating, and even addictive. They love this stuff!"      "Religious and ecclesiological voyeurism is certainly nothing new.  The modern-era church (especially in the last several decades) has been filled with who those in the real estate business call "lookie-loos" -- people who act like serious buyers, but really have no intention of doing so."      "The emerging church needs more voyageurs, not more voyeurs!  On the surface, the difference may seem incidental -- but don't be fooled! The (French) voyageur was a hearty explorer and guide (especially cir. 1650-1750), usually through unknown and unexplored territory -- a trailblazer extraordinaire!"   "May God therefore help us to discourage emerging church voyeurism, and instead -- empower women and men to step out and take risks and be the voyageurs that following generations will thank God for."    Thanks to  urlLink Stephen Shields  for pointing the way to Chris' indictment.

        How to Lose Friends and Infuriate People  Interesting list from the  urlLink Regent Business Review  via    urlLink Fast Company   .  I especially like number 13...   "Hold lots of meetings and make sure they have an unfocused agenda. Allow the conversation to meander aimlessly, permitting one tangential comment to give license to the next. Never cut off a rambling participant and if anyone has a good idea, compel that person to assume responsibility for a new committee to pursue the idea. End each meeting with no action items."   And what about number 9?   "Interpret all suggestions for improvement as personal attacks on your leadership."   When will we, as leaders, even...  no, especially  ...Christian leaders - realize it's all about how we treat other people?

        "From Worthless to Priceless"   (OK, even if you weren't/aren't a fan of President Reagan or horses, this one is still a great story!)     One of the coolest parts of President Reagan's - and other state funerals - was the riderless horse. I've kind of gotten a charge out of that ever since I saw the pictures of JFK's funeral procession. The horse, Sergeant York that did the honors for President Reagan's procession, has a great story. You can check out Dave Kindred's column about him  urlLink here .   "That day the pacer Allaboard Jules ran third in yet another cheap race at New Jersey's Freehold Raceway, maybe earning $300, not enough to meet the blacksmith's bills. Brandwine, the trainer and owner, had put Jules in the race hoping another owner would take him for the $4,000 claiming fee.  That's about what the horse cost Brandwine two years earlier, and his fondest wish was to get out even.  But no bites.  There never were any.  'Nobody wanted him,' the trainer said. Everyone knew Allaboard Jules' problems. He was small, no more than 15 hands high, and any horseman looking at him would agree with Brandwine's race-tracker summary of the horse's conformation: 'He was bowlegged and cross-eyed.'  Meaning, he can't run, and he's ugly, too.  Cold.  Of course, he could run, just not quickly. And even the man whose livelihood depended on the horse's quickness knew that Allaboard Jules was a beautiful horse - alert, black, shining."    How many times do we give up on someone before it's time? How many times do we fail to see the "priceless" and only see the "worthless"?   urlLink WOW!

        It's the Passion, Stupid!  I know a lot of talented people. Talented in a lot of different areas. Some of them are recognized as high achievers in their chosen endeavors. Some of them - some of us? - seem to be always waiting for the potential to be fulfilled. I've often wondered what the difference is.  Anita Sharpe gives some great insight in  urlLink this piece  over at  urlLink   Worthwhile   .  Check this quote...   "And it hit me: while there is certainly no excellence without talent,  it's over-the-top enthusiasm that makes the real difference.  True excellence fueled by passion doesn't have to be outwardly encouraged, even in children. It doesn't require 'motivation' - at least as we commonly practice it.   True excellence is about finding that one thing that you do well and want to do many hours a day, even when the field is muddy or your fingers bleed."

I had predicted to my wife that "My Heart Will Go On" from   Titanic   would be the top pick (It came in at #14).  Most of the ones I saw were pretty good.

        Ch-ch-changes...   urlLink      urlLink    OK, so it's not really all that big of a change, but I'm trying out  urlLink Firefox  for browsing. I'm also giving  urlLink Thunderbird  a test drive for e-mail.  I've been an exclusive Internet Explorer/Outlook user ever since I got one of these crazy things, and I've had no real problems that I know of. But for some reason, I got a little paranoid yesterday while reading about the   urlLink Scob thing  and other little nasties out there.  So far, I haven't noticed a whole lot that's different, except for a couple of little things that I was accustomed to in IE. The only real issue is that - right now, at least - graphics seem to load pretty slowly in Firefox, as compared to Internet Explorer. Maybe some of you "tech geeks" can tell me if I'm missing something somewhere.
