       urlLink    There's Tracey and Molly Armentrout and Me.  Again, I'm pictured eating.  You can see Mrs. Karns' hands there to the left.  You can see my dad going to the bathroom in the background there.  Notice the lovely tiles on the wall.

       urlLink    This is Mr. and Mrs. Karns.  They're eating some food while talking to the person across from them.  I'm just eating some food.  In the background, you can see my mom.  I think she's about to sit in that high chair, but can't because the camera is stuck to her hands.

       urlLink    This is my grandpa, his two brothers, and his mom (my great-grandma).  The clock in the background says 2:42 PM  It must have been 2:42 PM.

       urlLink    This here is my lovely confirmation cake.  The bottom one is white and the top one is marble.  The cake reads: "A CONFIRMATION CELEBRATION, JUSTIN, JUNE 6, 2004"  I didn't have any of it, but I'm sure it was good.

      Let me explain to you my profile picture.  First of all, to really see it, you have to click it.  It will enlarge.  Second of all, that is me.  I'm wearing my ultra hip leisure suit!  It's pretty pimping.  Notice the shoes too.  Third of all, that's not my television in the background.  That's not even my house.  That picture was taken at my grandparents' house.  Though, that is my picture in the background there.  Some of those cards are probably from me too.  I give my grandparents cards sometimes.  Then, they let me come to their house in a leisure suit to get my picture taken.  So, children, give your grandparents cards.  Then, you can be hip like me!

      You know what's wrong with this world?  It's television.   Back in my day, we had television heroes like the Power Rangers and Superman.  They did good things, you know?  Now a days, these kids have bad heroes.  They have, like, The F Word Man, Scantily Clad Women Man, Pelvic Thrust man, and The Double Entendre Boy.  These guys can't do anything!  If there's, like, King Kong on top of the building with a princess, they couldn't save the princess.  They'd get there and they'd cause more trouble.  I mean, all The Double Entendre Boy will do is keep referring back to when the building was erected.  The Scantily Clad Women Man will just use the building as a pole.  The F Word man will just curse King Kong out, and Pelvic Thrust Man won't even show up.  So next time you get kidnapped by an ape, call the Power Rangers instead.  Just a thought.

      You know, I've always thought of myself as being on top of things (in other words, I'm able to put my shoes on), but sometimes I question that.  You see, just a second ago, I decided to go out and get the mail, because sometimes I get mail, and I can read it, and it gives me something to do.  Well, before I went outside, I had to make sure that I was fully dressed.  And I was, but I didn't have anything on my feet!    ------------------------------------ JUSTIN'S RULE OF LIFE NUMBER ONE: It's usually a pretty good idea to put shoes on if you're going outside.  Otherwise, you can hurt your foot.  You can also get tapeworm.  Or roundworm.  Or whatever worm it is that you get by not wearing shoes.  And that's not good.  Because it can eat your stomach and you can die.* ------------------------------------  Well, I didn't want to have to get socks on (because it takes quite a while), so I decided just to wear sandals.    Now, my sandals are velcro.  And the fine makers of my sandals (Faded Glory) decided to make the sandals easy to put on for people like me.  You see, on the left foot, for example, the straps point to the left.  That way you know that it goes on your left foot.  I usually have no problem with that!  It's quite easy.  So, when I went to put them on, I looked at one of the shoes.  "Which foot does this go on?" I thought to myself.  The strap was pointing to the left.  "It must go on the left!"  So, I started to put it on my left foot, when suddenly I had other thoughts.  "Maybe it's pointing to the left because it goes on the foot that has the big toe furthest to the left."  I thought for a moment.  "That would be my right foot!"  So I put it on my right foot, and put the other on my left foot.  Suddenly I realized how uncomfortable they were.    But, at that moment, I fell down.    It kind of hurt but not that much.    I went out to the mailbox only to find that there was nothing for me.  And the world was saved yet again by JUSTIN KLINE!!!     ----------------------------------  *JUSTIN'S RULE OF LIFE NUMBER TWO: Don't smoke.  It pollutes the air.

      While surfing the internet today, I came across this quote:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     "I think people *can* relate to rap, that's why it sells. It's the angry voice of a marginalised youth, for nu-metal this seems to working class urban youth."  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It was posted on a message board by someone named Cider Jim.  So basically, what Cider Jim is saying is that the genre of rap music is succesful (yeah right) because you can relate to it.   Okay, sure.  Maybe rap music  is  relatable to some people.  But not very many.  I mean, have you ever listened to these lyrics?  "I PUT THE WHISKEY IN THE HOT DOG WITH A SYRINGE!!!"  I don't do that.  I can't relate to putting whiskey in hot dogs with a syringe.  That's illegal . . . or is it?  But, even I can relate to some rap lyrics.   "WHAT? WHAT? RAISE THE ROOF! WHAT? RAISE THE ROOF!  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! DAWGG!"  I can relate to that totally.  So, Mr. Cider Jim, I'd say you have a good point.  The average rap consumer  can  relate to the music they buy.  Whether it be injecting alcoholic beverages into children's food, or remodeling their roof on the anniversary of their birth, rap consumers have done it!  This myth has been busted by Justin Kline, Dog Extraordinaire!   Can you pass me some of that cider Jim?  All of this talking made me thirsty.

      Okay, I was thinking about this:     You know the drug Vacuum Cleaner?  That's where you take all of the stuff out of a vacuum cleaner and smoke it.  Now, let's say a druggie (we'll call him Raul) wants to smoke some Vacuum Cleaner.  Before Raul can have some fun, he's going to have to vacuum his floor first.  It's like:  Raul has his buddies over and they're all sitting on the couch. Raul's all: "Hey man, I got some vacuum cleaner!" and Superfly's like: "Hey man, can I have some, man?" it's like: "No man, I was doin' stuff earlier, I gotta get it first!" his buddie's like: "What you gotta do, man?  Go in the garden and pick it?" Raul's like: "No man, I gotta vacuum!" He pulls out his vacuum and he puts on his apron and starts vacuuming. "Hey man, can you move your feet, man.  There's some dirt under you man!"   Just a thought!

       So here I was, in the kitchen.  I had just opened the cupboard to get myself a cup.  When all of a sudden, I heard a noise.  I couldn't believe my ears.  "Vroom, vroom," the noise said.      I ran out of the kitchen and into the living room.  I looked out the window only to find a car that had stopped right beside our mailbox.   I figured that he was either    A) Stealing the mail    B) Giving us a pipe bomb or C) Asking for directions   I settled on A) finally and decided to figure out who it was.  I grabbed my handy dandy binoculars and had a closer look.   It was a red car.  It was sort of beaten up.  But, I knew exactly who it was when I saw the sign on top of his car.  The sign, of course, said MAIL.       It was the MAILMAN!!!  I couldn't believe it!  The mailman was stealing our mail!!   I quickly ran outside (with no shirt on) and ran up to the mailbox.  About half way up, he must have saw me and got scared because he drove away.   When I got there I realized that I had noticed him just in time.  I must have scared him just in time because he didn't have time to steal the mail.  I had scared him away before he even had time to  take anything.  The mail was in the mailbox!      So I grabbed the mail and ran back inside.  I then refreshed myself with a nice glass of water.     I felt a feeling that was so inexplicable that it was great.   The day had been saved (yet again) by JUSTIN KLINE!!!

          Yeah, this is my web log.  I don't know why I got one of these deals.  It's kind of stupid.  It's just me rambling on to the point of no return.  No one will read it neither!  Everyone's too busy trading You-jee-ohs.  But, everyone else has one of these dealios.  And, everyone else has a link in their America Online Instant Messenger Information that links people to their ever so interesting web log.  You see, I have already ran into a problem with this web logger.  My sentence above that talks about people putting links in their information was said facetiously.  Now, you don't know that, because you are just reading what the computer screen says.  You could have gotten the idea that I go around reading everyone's blog repeatedly because I find it ever so interesting (which I don't).  This is exactly why I prefer rambling out loud!      Ah well.  So this is my first post onto my web log.  Now, I'm not going to be corny and introduce myself by saying that my name is Justin Kline.  I'm not going to say that I'm from Exira, Iowa.  I'm not even going to tell you my age (which is 13).  Heavens no, that's just too cliched for Justin Kline.  I'll start out my web log by doing something different.  I'll do something which has never been done before.  I'll start off my web log by, um, drinking a glass of water.  . . .      So, um, I'm going to get drink that glass of water.  I'll be back later to post more unneeded details into this newly started web log of mine..  So, um, goodbye.
