      Ok, so you're getting hit. i couldnt imagine being hit. i have seen rick angry, but he would never hit me. and yet, her brother hit her. i dont get it. what could posess someone to do that? Drugs... drugs drugs drugs, like the pot in ricks coat. Nothing is ok, no drugs, no smokes... and the fact, i will probably end up having sex with a married 25 year old IS NOT OK! also... i think i may be developing a 'crush' persay on someone that i shouldnt. Whats wrong with me? i dont know how i feel, i think im lonely. I cant help but like anyone who may offer me some kind of attention. Like the guy at the butchers. Im not attractive, nor am i nice. Datable. No. Im me. im nothing.   please come now, i think im falling im holding on to all i think is safe...     But how can u convince someone who is so great, not to hurt themself. They dont realise how much they are fucking themselves up. Its not just them they are hurting. Me. Her friends. Her family.   it seems i've found the road to nowhere   and im trying to escape   i cry out "heaven save me" but im down to one last breath   and with it let me say... let me say...     Why do i push away people? sarah, lauren... now, reflecting back to canada, what the fuck was i doing to eric? oh my god... they took me in, cared for me, housed me, fed me... all for nothing, and yet, i fucked it all over. I want my journal back. I am a slut. a whore. Paul scott matt colton paul craig dave... dave with the big dick... big dick dave... scary eh. Memory sucks.   hold me now... im six feet from the edge and im thinkin   maybe six feet, aint so far down...     Well, i think thats about it from me. I dont believe anyone aside from me is reading this, and i think it should stay that way, but i dont know what to think. Damn you heart, cant u not care???    it would be easier to be heartless and not care, than to care this much and suffer the pain

        ~**god send me an angel, from the heavens above... send me an angel to heal my broken heart form being in love...**~       I realised, after carefully analysing a situation, that i really miss someone whom meant so much to me for so long... and the disdain of looks i give his girlfriend, i dont mean it, but i cant help it. I miss him. And there is so much problems going on here, but not a day goes by where i dont look at you - i dont think of you - not a day in which i dont remember how much happiness you gave me. So many times i have wanted to run up to you and hug you, but that can never happen. Too many irreperable issues. And then there are friendships which are in tatters, what the fuck is wrong with me? why cant i approve of Lauren and Rick? why am i mad at nicole and matt? why is matt s a cunt? why did i happen to be fooling aruond with clausen when chris was there,... he was mad... and i call myself a friend? I stare so blankly at this fucking white screen in front of me... mentally cursing every thought going through my head. A peaceful way to cover tracks of confusion, pain and sorrow. I will never be the same person. I am barely a person. Like, lies... so many lies... dont get me started on the lies!! its easier to lie and be someone good that you want to be, than be truthful and be someone that everyone hates. I dont know what i am   i dont know who i am   i dont know why i am   but i know... i am ... nothing

        With broken dreams and silent screams...         nothing matters or so it seems...

      Well, this is my first posting... kinda weird i guess, im perplexed as to what to write, but i will think of something eventually. So many thoughts circulating my mind... Doc Martens; the guy from the shop in bairnsdale; my planned holiday; but mostly my cunt of a brother. Im sure anyone else reading this simply doesnt care about how i feel, so i gotta get my thoughts out somehow, so i guess i will write it here. So rick... 21 going on 10. Alcoholism. Depression. Bi-Polar?? I dont really know, but i do know, he ruined my birthday last year, he makes me feel shit... the yelling, screaming, pain he causes just arent very nice. I dunno, i guess my birthday was a blessing in a way, i guess i did get one extra nite with matt, but all in all, i wish he was a good big brother. I love him, but i have to. Hes my brother. I dont love him, or even like him as a person. If it wasnt for the same blood ties, then there is no way i would even tolerate him.                         * i cant live... with or without you...*

       urlLink   Kiss From A Rose Lyrics     urlLink   There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea.You became the light on the dark side of me.Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill.But did you know,That when it snows,My eyes become large andThe light that you shine can be seen.Baby,I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.Ooh,The more I get of you,Stranger it feels, yeah. And now that your rose is in bloom. A light hits the gloom on the grey. There is so much a man can tell you,So much he can say.You remain,My power, my pleasure, my pain, baby To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny. Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?But did you know,That when it snows,My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.Ooh, the more I get of youStranger it feels, yeahNow that your rose is in bloom. A light hits the gloom on the grey, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey,I've been kissed by a rose I've been kissed by a rose on the grey,...And if I should fall along the wayI've been kissed by a rose ...been kissed by a rose on the grey.There is so much a man can tell you,So much he can say.You remainMy power, my pleasure, my pain. To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby.But did you know,That when it snows,My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.Ooh, the more I get of youStranger it feels, yeahNow that your rose is in bloom, A light hits the gloom on the grey. Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the greyOoh, the more I get of youStranger it feels, yeahAnd now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom on the grey Now that your rose is in bloom, A light hits the gloom on the grey.
