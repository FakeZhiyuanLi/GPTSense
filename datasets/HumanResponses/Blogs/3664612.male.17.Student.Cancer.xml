      Hahahahah! My prediction was correct. Go Greece! Reason why im so happy is because I hate the French team. Its nothing personal, just that they are too good o.O Angelos Charisteas's second-half header ended the holders' hopes of retaining their trophy. I think Greece will go to the finals and hopefully win their first title. It reminds me of the Denmark team in 1992 which won the Euro Cup despite the prediction that they wouldnt even reach the semi-final. Ill write some shit up later. Good Day

      Well on June 25 was my birthday, and all of my close friends said happy birthday to me, which was the highlight of my day. Usually if it is your birthday you get a gift. Well ill tell you what I got. From me parents I got a MP3 player which is pretty cool, and from my sister I got a jacket. For the celebration my dad took us to dinner to a restaurant, instead most of my dad's workers/co-workers were there, so I had to sit in a table where im surrounded by people around 30+ years old. The only good thing about it was the food. The food was just great, and I had 2 desserts because I was the birthday boy, plus they sang happy birthday to me, sad very sad. In a good way though.  Well England lost in the quarter-final. Im so ticked off right now. England should have won that game, reason is because they were leading until the 83rd minute. And the keeper James is a fucking bad keeper. He missed one of the easiest goals in the tournament. Another thing which pissed me off was the goal that was disallowed because the ref thought it was a foul. If you see the replay of that goal, it was obvious that John Terry did not foul the keeper. It is because John Terry was going for the header first and Sol Campbell came up from behind and pushed John Terry down to get to the header. Thus John Terry, did not do that on propose and it was no intentional. Making the fucking ref wrong! Argh......  Well, as my friend said its no used crying over spilled milk. Now the 2nd quarter-final game Greece against France is that my prediction that Greece will beat France in one of the biggest upset in the tournament. These are the teams I believe will make the semi's besides Portugal. Greece, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. Im tired so ill end it here, yawn

      Well I did my oral, but the teacher gave me a chance to do it on monday. But nay I refuse. I thought it was better to get it out of the way. Well I thought I did a pretty crap speech, but everyone kept telling me it was good. I hate it when people do that. They say you did a good job but deep inside they thought you did a really crap oral. Pisses me off so much. Any who, my prediction was correct, Netherlands did beat Latvia 3-0 and the Czech Republic did beat Germany 2-1. Well tonight is the game, England vs Portugal. But im confident that England will beat the host nation, reason why is because this England squad is the best i've seen in a long time. With the young striker Rooney I believe that England will be too much for Portugal. Right now im too lazy to write, so ill end it here. Ta-ta for now

      Well today, has been another uneventful day for me. I got some of my test scores back, and let me just say I didn't do so well. Well, im not the type to get upset by something so small, so ill tell you what I did today. After school I had to go to the dentist. I hate the dentist, its just how they put all these machine and stuff into your mouth. Plus I had a bad experience at the dentist. Well everything went alright, no cavities. My teeth are just perfect, but im grinding in my sleep. It seems that I grind in my sleep and it wears down my 2 canine teeth, and if I don't stop then I would had to wear this protection thingy when I sleep. Beside the dentist appointment this day was as usual.  Now ill update the euro cup. The final match for the top eight is tonight, and hopefully the Netherlands can win and the Czech Republic beat the German's. My bet is that England will beat Portugal and Greece will beat France. Oh shite I got an oral tomorrow, better start cracking. later days

      An 85th minute strike from Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was probably one of the best football goals ive seen in a long time. Using the heel Ibrahimovic chip the ball over Vieri's head.  I'll stop writing about sports for a while since its getting old. Anyways today was an ordinary day for yours truly. Did nothing but played with my ps2. Continuing with my FIFA 2004 career and i played a bit of Smackdown since its fun especially the bra and panties match xD Oh i did rent some DVD's. The movie i rented was "Confession of a Dangerous Mind" it was alright, not a great movie but there are some funny bits. but overall i give it a 7 out of 10. im tired now, ill post something later

      Its week 2 of the Euro Cup, which is held in Portugal. So far the biggest surprise in the whole tournament are the Greek team. In their opening match which was also the opening match of the Tournament they defeat Portugal 2-1. And in their second match they tied against one of the best team in Europe, Spain. Now Greece are 1 first place in group A just in front of Spain by goal difference. Now my opinion is that the Greeks will go through to the final 8 along with Spain. Now in group B England defeated the Swiss 3-0. 2 goals by Wayne Rooney and 1 from the Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard. And France coming from a 1 goal deficit to share the points with Croatia. Now the Croatian played really well besides the own goal. But its too bad that the Croatian did not win that match. They can still make the final 8 if they defeat the England side. Today is in group C Bulgaria will go against their Scandinavian opponents Denmark. But the match of the day will be Sweden and Italy. I think Sweden will win this tight match. Ill update you more tomorrow. If not check the Euro Cup website. www.euro2004.com

      Finally Motown has won the NBA title since 1990 from the cockiest team in the NBA the LA Lakers. Now i know the news is pretty old but its just a way to tell the Lakers fans out there that your team sucks dicks.  First of all the reason why i hate the Lakers is that they are a one dimensional team. Since they believe that buying every good player in the NBA will make them win the championship. To me thats just a form of cheating, since good players have huge egos like for example Kobe Bryant. Sure they can pull great shots when its crunch time but you cannot expect a team filled with superstars to win. And the Detroit Pistons proved that. They got great team work and they deserve to win the championship.  Now to another sport. Football, also know as soccer. If you follow football like me, then you would know the team Real Mardrid. Yes i know the team with about 6 superstars. Theres Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Raul, Roberto Carlos, and who could forget the metrosexual faggot David Beckham. There are more of course but those 6 are the main superstars in the team. Now if you dont know football then you would think that Real Madrid is the best team in Europe. Wrong. Not only do they suck, but this year they didnt even win any trophies. Pffff, its a joke. what ever happened to good old fashion football players playing for the love of the sport now its all bout the money. I think theres a song like that "its all a money..." well that enough writing for today

      Bored and tired after some soccer with the embassy workers, i decided to rent some DVD's to past the time. I rented LOTR: return of the king, Brother Bear, and Jackass xD  I just finished watching Brother Bear and it is one of the best Disney movies ive seen in a long time. Great animation, wonderful storyline. Need i say more?

      Brrr, its cold outside. Well for the last half hour ive been outside. Why you ask? it is because i got locked out of my house. Yes its funny, so ill tell you the story to make it even more funny.   I just got back from school and my mum was about to leave to pick up my brother from his guitar lesson. So i wanted to see if there was any good movies on tonight on TV. But i forgot to get the newspaper in the morning, so i went outside with my shorts and a short sleeve shirt. As i was getting the newspaper i heard a loud   BANG   And the door was closed.   FUCK!!!!!! .  It was cold, and it was gettin' dark. Its a good thing my mum came back in about 30 minutes. If i stayed outside for another minute my dick would fallen off o.O     God how i hate cold weather.

        I am the greatest man in the world!!!      xD   Anyways yesterday was the Hari Anak Ceremony. In the morning all of my muscles especially the  Pectoralis major  (check it up if you don't know what it means) was really sore. So I was about to stay home and sleep the entire day but I went anyways. The weather was miserable since it was raining the whole day, plus the Indonesian&nbsp;indoor soccer competition, held a week before independence&nbsp;day&nbsp;was not going to happen since no one wanted to organize it. Argh!! Ive been waiting 5 months for the competition. And of a sudden they tell me that they wont have it this year. It makes me so angry >(&nbsp;   But overall the day wasnt so bad. For Hari Anak they always have contest so little kids&nbsp;age 3-13 can win cheap prizes. One contest which caught my eye was the Hula Hoop Competition. But for this competition they pick anyone who wants to join, so I decided to give it a go. Now I was pretty nervous since I was the only guy above 13 to do it. But because the girl who I think is attractive was cheering me on, I held my breath and focused my energy to my waist so I can shake my   ass   so fast that it will beat the other contestant (who are 7 year-olds) I blew away the competition and I won! And I never even used a Hula Hoop before. Since I won I got 3 kinder surprise chocolate xD&nbsp;Which I gave 1 to the Anne (the girl who i find attractive). So the whole day i spent with Arya, Anne, and Keke. Just talking and walking around the embassy. I entered another contest, this time a quiz contest. Sadly i came 3rd place and won a $5 toys-r-us&nbsp;voucher o.O   What can you buy in toys-r-us for 5 freaking dollars!? jeez the people who organize this are pretty cheap faggots. Anyways i have a history essay due tomorrow. Later days &nbsp;

       Well, i've been going to the gym lately and im so   FUCKING   tired. Yesterday i went to the gym just to see if im still as fit as i used to be, sadly im not. I tried bench-pressing which works out your chest muscles, and i could only do 20kg. For my friends this is weak since they all can do at least 40kg. So today i tried doing it again and i improved. Now i can carry 35kg. Plus i have the strongest abdomen in my group xD So this gym thing will be a routine thing for me, and i'll try going twice a week.   Moving on......Today i played indoor soccer, for&nbsp;2 freaking hours. I was fun but because all of my friends were slide tackling me (since im soooo good) i sprained my ankle. Its not that bad but it has been my 9th injury this year alone o.O Tomorrow, there's this Hari Anak Upacara, and im lazy to go...but i have to. Ah tired i want to sleep. This will be enough for today.  &nbsp;    KEEP WATCHING THE STARS!!    god how i hate the X-files xD&nbsp;

      It was an ordinary day for me. Being the first day of school I didnt do very much. Anyways usually when it is lunch time I play a bit of Indoor soccer, but not today. I spent most of my lunch time staring at the sky. Now for some people this might seem weird but to me its really relaxing. The last couple of days I had a lot of things in my mind eg: school, grades, future, relationships, family, assignments and hot&nbsp;chicks xD.  &nbsp;  Anyways while I was staring up to the clear blue sky of&nbsp;Canberra I had a think about everything that has happened in my life past and present. I realize that the past and the memory I have with all my friends in Cita Buana means a lot to me. I guess I never knew how I love being in CB. When I left for Canberra I didnt know how much it meant to me. Only now i realize why. My friends and my memory of CB gives me a reason to smile each day. I dont know why the memory of CB and my friends make me smile i guess its just&nbsp;my happy thought.  &nbsp;  Besides thinking about my past i was also thinking about what will happen to me in the future and shit like that. Now ive notice that a lot of people stress about University and what will happen to them after they graduate. A lot of people have asked me what i want to do afterwards, usually i just say " i have no idea ". To me i dont really think of the future that much. Reason is because people now are too anxious to reach their destination whether its getting rich before 25 or just finishing University. But to me i like to just sit back and enjoy the ride life will offer me. I dont care if i go to a top notch University or if i go to some community college. And its because i will enjoy myself every step of the way, till the very end. i dont regret anything and i'll never will. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, its my motto.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now while I was reminiscing about everything else in my life, I completely lost track of time and I was 15 minutes late for Oz lit. o.O&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here's a great joke I found in :  urlLink   www.jokes.com        &nbsp;  A little old lady sits at the luncheonette counter and orders a hamburger. The huge guy behind the counter bellows, "One burger!"   Whereupon the chef grabs a huge hunk of chopped meat, stuffs it in his bare armpit, pumps his arm a few times to squeeze it flat, and then tosses it on the grill.   "That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen," the old lady says.   "Yeah?" says the counterman. "You should be here in the morning when he makes the doughnuts."    &nbsp;  Funny stuff xD

      We, today has been an uneventful day for me. Didn't get out of the house, except for Sholat Jumat. Anyways I had a really weird dream last night. I'll tell you about it since theres nothing else I could really talk about, except for the whole Annisa thing but I'll explain that later on.  &nbsp;  Now the dream starts off in my college in Canberra. It was lunch time and I was chatting with some of my friends. Now every lunch time most of the time we play a bit of indoor soccer. For some reason I brought my soccer ball. But the thing is I was really protective of the ball, what I mean by this is that I was always constantly looking after it. Lunch is now over, and after class I saw Annisa and Christina. I walk up to them and I started talking to them. But for some reason I turned my back on them and then they disappeared. Then I spent most of the time searching for my bag and my soccer ball. Eventually, I ended up in my old high school in Canberra. I was still searching for my bag but then I found myself in some mall, trying to get away from my parents. o.O After finally getting away from my parents&nbsp;I walked out side of the mall and I found myself in front of Cita Buana, but as I was about to enter the place a door with a lock was in my way. And then I woke up.  &nbsp;  Weird dream, I had some idea of the dream but if people have suggestion please feel free to tell me. Anyways&nbsp;I have school on monday. *sigh* back to school&nbsp;&nbsp;

      God how i hate Idol shows. This includes American Idol, Australian Idol and all the other countries who does this type of show. The reason why i hate it so much is that it takes up at least an hour, and because of that some shows get cancelled for the season. An example of this is the Simpson. Here in Australia they show the Simpson 2 times, but because of this Australian Idol they are only showing it once. God dammit, plus its just depressing seeing all those idiots who actually go to the audition just to have their 5 seconds of fame. I was watching it today and there was a lot of pathetic fuckers here in Australia. Jeez i just had enough of these Idol shows, this also includes some reality shows. For example: Temptation Island, The bachelor, Joe millionaire, Average Joe the list goes on. I mean sure the some shows are actually good like Survivor, or the Apprentice. But sometimes enough is enough. Well ill stop complaining for now. Back to reading for me xD

      Well, I just got back from a get-together with the Indonesian people celebrating the success of the under 11s Indonesian soccer team which came second in their group, sadly they didnt go through to the semi-finals. Anyways it wasnt much fun so ill talk about yesterday.  Yesterday was alright nothing big happened except for the dinner with Annisa's family and some Indonesian staff again.....This time I think was better than before, since there was less people. But the food sucked, and I mean really bad, since the food had a bitter after taste o.O. But the view was great. Since we ate at the Sydney Tower which was pretty cool the view from the top was incredible, we could almost see the whole of Sydney, it was the highlight of the evening for me.  Also yesterday was the day I gave the presents I bought for all of my friends in Cita Buana to Annisa. I think I bought presents for Damien, Christina, Annisa, Michael, Zio, Angie, Monita, Angel, Jen, and Yoshi. I only had enough money to buy for those people, so I didnt get the chance to buy one for Jisnu, Will, Michelle and Krisno. Well at least I bought presents for those people. Another reason why I didnt buy presents for them was I didnt want to trouble Annisa too much since she's the one bringing it to Jakarta. Now the thing is about the dinner is that, i had that thought again (for those who want to know the thought please read laughable) I still dont know why it only happens when i see her, i mean i spent most of the time trying to make the thought go away. Argh!! what does it mean! Does it mean i still have a bit of feelings for her or i regret breaking up with her. Bah, i think those two answers are wrong anyways. Maybe its just because i never expected her to come to Australia, and actually meeting her. So ill end it here, fudge out.....

      *Sigh* Yesterday a friend of mine from Indonesia came to Canberra. I dont know why she would actually come here. I mean yes its great to see her but why Canberra. It came as a surprise for me since i didnt know she was coming here. The day she arrive my mum said "you dont have plans tonight right, because we're eating dinner at a restaurant." Being me, i love to eat food so i said, sure why not. Just before we left my mum said to wear nice clothes. But hey anything that i put on will look nice matter what, since im sooooo good-looking xD  Anyways by the time we got to the restaurant my mum mentioned that Annisa's family is coming. I was like "what the F**K!" why didnt she told me sooner. Maybe its just the shock of having one of my closest friends coming to Canberra, since its been 6 months since i last saw her. What i hated most from that dinner was how my sister acted towards me. Since i used to date Annisa and my sister cant get over it, and always kept mentioning how we're 'made for each other' A load of bullcrap. But the dinner went smoothly. I forgot to mention that the dinner was with a lot of the embassy workers. This is because Annisa's father is a high ranking government thingy, i dont know what he does but i know that his ranking is high. Anyways the food was great it one of those fusion restaurants with cuisines from all over the world.  After the dinner and after all the workers said goodbye and shit like that. On my way back home for some reason i cant stop thinking about how i used to feel about her. I have no idea why it happened that day, since when i last saw her in Indonesia, there was nothing....and now theres that thought. Maybe thats why the title is 'Laughable'. I guess its just one of those things ill have to learn to forget.  On the plus side since she is here i could give her the present i was going to give all my friends, if i get to see to her again before she leave and i dont have presents for all of my friends then i gotta remember to give her my red hat to christina and my old NY cap to her and maybe something for Damien

      Well i started the day by watching the Euro cup final, and my prediction was correct. The Greeks did beat Portugal. The Greeks scored on the 56th minute, and Portugal had their chances to even up the scores, but i guess it wasnt met to be for the Portugal. After the game, i went back to sleep and woke up at around 11 am. Had breakfast and played a bit of Far Cry.  Now Far Cry is the best PC game i've ever played. I just love the graphics, its so smooth. Well at around noon i played a bit of PS2 and i continued my career in FIFA 2004 with Birmingham FC. At around 3 my friend called me saying theres this under-age club tonight, i was about to go but i hate clubs so i didnt. Some of the girls i know wanted me to come but because i didnt some are pretty pissed at me o.O Instead i went to see the 10 year olds Indonesia Football club play in the Kanga Cup. Too bad they lost 4-2. But hey i thought i played pretty good. Tomorrow im watching them play again, maybe because i felt sorry for them, since they're the only Indonesian team in the whole tournament. But for some of the people i know they come for the chance to get publicity, which pisses me off. Ill talk about that later on.  Now today the weather was so fucking cold, my feet nearly turned blue. God i hate cold weather! Crowley mentioned that the weather in Indonesia is nice right now. What i wouldnt do just to go to the nice and humid weather in Indonesia. *sigh*

      Well today has been a fairly interesting day for me. I haven't talked to Ellie, for a while so there is not much progress. Anyways, a good friend of Ellie, her name is Jess. Is really good friends with one of me mates, his name is Darin. And I found today that this Jess, wants to fuck me xD  Yes I know what you're thinking, and I agree. Most girls do want to fuck me but they're just too shy to admit it. Anyways, she also told me friend that the group I hang with, is in her words are the Hot guys group (that includes me) So when he told me that, it really boost my confidence with girls. But not only Jess thinks that our group is hot. Most of the girls she hang around with agrees with her (that includes Ellie) They all think that: Ahmed is really hot, Oren is extremely hot, James is hot, Darin is hot, and I'm hot.  Now after this day I'm a lot more confident in confronting girls. xD  Fudge Out........

      Well, I'll just right to the point. I want to ask Ellie out. But I'm not sure if she likes me that way. I've had bad experience with asking girls out. There was one time, where I like this girl. Her name was Michelle. All my friends influenced me to ask her out, since they believe that she liked me too. I asked her, but I got turned down. Her reason for turning me down was that she only wants to be ' just friends '. And now my friends still make fun of me about it. The second one, Kimberley. I started from scratch. I barely knew her but I decided that I would get to know her better, and thus resulting her to like me. And if she did start to like me, which I thought she did. Then I would ask her out. But she turned me down saying ' I don't even know you .' So in a span of 3 years I got rejected twice. So my confidence with girls is not that good. Now I'm as smooth as rice when it comes to talking with girls, but when it comes to asking a girl out I'm not.  Now this girl Ellie, is amazing. She is the most out-going person I've met in Canberra. There's something about her that separates her from all the other girls in my school. So maybe that is why, I really want to ask her out. But every time I think that I made some progress, there is always a doubt that she might not even feel the same way about me. *Sigh* I'll continue to try, since I don't believe in giving up. But the thing about asking her out, I'm still not 100% sure about it.

      In the morning wasn't the best day for me. Why you ask? I'll tell you why. First of all I woke up late, my parents got pissed at me, i nearly missed my bus, I hit my funny bone in Math class, And i nearly got hit by a car in the parking lot o.O  To make it worst i think i might have blew my chance to get to know this girl i like. Her name is Ellie, short for Ellizabeth. Now I'll describe Ellie, for my trusty readers. She is beautiful. She has a great body, smart, funny, nice, and very friendly. But the thing i love most about her is her butt. Now for the male readers I'll to describe it. But sadly i cant describe it. Its one of those things you have to see to believe xD  Anyways, back to the story. Now it was afterschool and i saw Ellie, and as always she look great. So she was talking to one of her friends and she came up to me. But the question was for her other friend about some assignment. While i was there, i started talking to her and i found out that we both hate the same teacher. So me and her walked to the bus stop and i asked her where she is going after school, she said that she's going to starbucks and afterwards to eat some sushi with 2 of her other friends. She made a comment that she's only tagging along with the other girls. She asked me if i wanted to come. At that moment i was so fucking happy. BUT i had a big assignment due tomorrow and i had to finish it. So i declined, FUCK!!!! im so pissed off right now. If i dont get another chance with her Im gonna cry.......fuck this day sucks

      I've been listening to the Beastie Boys today, and that song 'You Gotta Fight for Your Right' is one Kick-Ass song xD  Here's the lyrics, Enjoy   You wake up late for school and you don't wanna go.   You ask your mom please but she still says no.   You miss two classes and no homework.   But your teacher preaches class like he's some kinda jerk.      You gotta fight    For your right   To party.      Your pop caught you smokin' and he said no way.   That hypocrite smokes two packs a day.   Man, livin' at home is such a drag.   Now, your mom threw away your besy porno mag. (BUST IT)      You gotta fight   For your right   To party.      You gotta fight!      Get out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear.   I'll kick you out of my home if you dont cut that hair!   Your Mom busted in and said what's that noise?   Aww Mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!      You gotta fight   For your right   To party. (2x)   party! (2x)

      Today, i've an assumption that girls in Australia are really shallow. Now i was in the computer lab with my friend and he's a bit of a car-nut. So he told me that girls are more interested in what type of car a guy has rather than the guy itself. So he told me a story about his friend who is butt ugly. Anyways, he has a Honda Intergra, all modified with 19" crome wheels. But even though he's REALLY ugly, this REALLY hot chick had sex with him. All because he has a cool car o.O  Now this is actually true, because i was cruising with my friends in this really cool car. We stopped at a neighbourhood supermarket. Some chicks came up to us and asked us if we were doing anything. Now we all said we had girlfriends because it was obvious the girls just wanted us for the car. So i guess my hypothesis that Australian girls are shallow is correct xD  Anyways i'll put the pic of the type of car Australian girls are into.
