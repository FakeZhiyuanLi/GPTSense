      Today, I met up with my friend at our usual spot, the neighborhood Starbucks.  She had just come back from running a bunch of errands and cleaning house for her mother.  She was frustrated.  Ultimately, because at the age of 24, she is more financially dependent on her parents than when she was living with them about 6 years ago.  The thing is that she's finally decided what she wants to do, and, her parents agreed to pay for everything, so long as she agrees not to work.  Who wouldn't pass that up, right?  Well, there is a price, even in that.  For instance, today, I accompanied my friend and her mother to the store.  I was somewhat of a mediator.  You see, since her parents are paying for everything, shopping for interview clothes required my friend's mother's approval for each outfit selection.  So, rather than accompanying her daughter to the dressing room to view the items she had put on hold, my friend's mother made her own outfit selections for her daughter.  This posed a problem, not only because, she was completely ignoring my friend's need for individuality but because the clothes she was picking out were designed to appeal to much older women (like, her age).  Not to mention the fact that everything she picked out consisted of a paisley floral print, elastic bands, or enormous shoulder pads; talk about a fashion nightmare!  And, who do you think was expected to support her positions?  Me, of course.  I did my best to both compliment the mother for her taste (ugh), all awhile, sway her decisions in order to spare my friend's reputation over wardrobe.  I had to get creative, and it seemed as though I was grabbing for words at times but somehow, I managed to save the day, without providing a forum for argument.  All I know is , tapered pants are not flattering, period-neither are they're baloon shaped-upper pant counterparts; shoulder pads are hideous, maybe disgusting even (unless someone is just completely without) -they remind me of Milly Vanilly, the bad part of the eighties, and women trying to be men; Then, there is elastic and paisley prints -enough said.  Its just wrong.

      Thats right, today my bestfriend told me that she has to build a mold of her own face to restore.  In addition, the face needs to exhibit definite trauma -in other words, a tragic death.  Apparently, the molds look pretty real, especially after applying all of those restorative materials.  I just can't imagine having to look at myself in that way -talk about messing with your head. Even my morbidly-preoccupied bestfriend found that disturbing.  Apparently, the school keeps restored models of their past students faces; and, as you walk through the hallways, they peer out at you.

      My best friend recently decided upon an occupation -turns out, she's going to become a mortician.  Her classes start in August, and, although I've never known anyone to take up such a career, I can't say that I would expect her to be so excited.  She has decided to completely immerce herself in the culture.  She began by purchasing the first two seasons of Six Feet Under- which, is good for me; since, its one of my favorite shows.  There is also this other show called Family Plots that she is determined to get her hands on.  Okay, so imagine this: we're sitting in this Vietnamese restaurant eating round steak soup when my best friend blurts out; Hey, do you wanna go watch an embalming with me (really it's just a video that she has to watch for the school)?  Keep in mind that her voice is as loud as someone who has just discovered that they won the lottery. Now, her goal is to become the HOT mortician.  A couple of weeks ago, we were hanging out and drinking at Friday's when this group of older men from Bangledesh approached us.  They started asking us a bunch of questions about what we do and so on when bestfriend proudly proclaims that she is becoming a mortician.  Next thing we knew, the men were backing off.  Well, what do you know, there are some benefits of having an undertaker for a friend.  Although, we haven't exactly tested it on guys our own age.  Her biggest fear is that her newly chosen profession will not offer any contributions to her love life.

      Okay, so about 6 years ago, I met this Irish Rugby player.  His name was David Cantley.  Although, I specifically remember him telling me that his name was Piette -the name of some famous rugby, player.  Anyway, I was dancing with my sister at this club called Red Jacket.  It was retro night and, that tune from Night Rider was playing when I noticed the group of young men wearing white polos; on the breast was stitched a green four-leafed clover, surrounded by an orange ribbon-like scroll.   Being that I was completely infactuated with the Irish, I decided to move my dancing toward them.  I began scanning them over when my eyes spotted David.  He was both adorable and handsome, with mesmorizing eyes.  I approached him and asked where he was from.  As we began dancing, I could not help but notice his scent, like some fresh, nautical cologne that sent forth waves of nostalgia, along with 100% pheromone enforcements-thats how good it was!  Next thing I knew, he was asking me for a smooch.  At first I said, no.  Then, I gave him a kiss on the forehead and smiled directly at him.  He begged and begged for real one, so, I gave him a kiss on his cheek, next came an eskimo kiss.  By then, even I couldn't resist.  All I can say is, it was the best, most enjoyable kiss, ever.  I think he might have even held my face.  Shortly after that, my sister was motioning for our departure.  The next day, I could not stop thinking about him.  My sister mentioned something of the experience to my parents and, the next day my father arrived home with a pamplet entitled Ullster Rugby.  It turns out that his friend at work was a big-time rugby player himself and had played the Irish Rugby team only a few days before.  That is when I discovered his picture, true identity, age, and team name.  Although he had lied about his name, I had sort of dashed out of the club.  So, when I came into the news online that his team would be playing one last game nearby, I figured it might be worth the drive.  Once I got there, it took a little social maneuvering through his teammates to get to the center of the huddle, where, at last he was, chugging anxiously from a large bottle of water and sweating profusely.  He was surprised that I was able to find him and showed up to the game.  I remember saying something silly like, my father has lots of connections.  Anyway, it wasn't a dream come true or anything.  At first, he acted like he didn't remember me; I don't know if he was just trying to be cool in front of his friends or if he was really that lame but he finally came to remember and was, I'd say, understandebly shocked.  I did stay to watch the game and when it was over, I think he invited me to come to their hotel.  I made some excuse up not to put myself in that situation.  I also remember him offering to exchange his rugby shirt for my spaghetti strap shirt but only if I agreed to exchange the shirts in this outhouse with him.  Yeah right, I think I said.  Well, there was a bit of sarcasm in it all but lets face it, the boy was a horny little shit. The next moment, his charming side shone through and his friends let us alone to enjoy one last kiss goodbye.  And, that one was just as good as the first -enough said.  Well, it may not seem like much, but I could not stop thinking about this guy for months and, obviously it still stands out among my romantic experiences and relationships up to about six years post occurrence.  Just today, I was reminded of him while looking through some Irish memorabilia and decided to write this.  I decided to try and look him up on the web -just out of curiosity and, I did stumble across a recent photo of him on a rugby site for Northern Ireland.  I thought about trying to contact him to see if he would remember.  Well, I'm sure he's had many of these experience with his rugby tours.  I still think it would be funny to write something like:  You know, I bet your a real shit but you sure do kiss well -thats the only reason I writing you...by the way, will you be coming back here anytime soon?  I'd hate for you to miss out on that smooch:).

      So, I've got a second interview tommorrow.  I feel pretty good about it but there is thus other job that I had my eye on.  The thing is, I really kind of like both of them but this other job would allow me to do more traveling.  It would also allow me to relocate to some pretty cool places if I chose to.  Ok, so I went to college, graduated, took a job (one of those corporate smorporate things) -couldn't stand it, became interested in a new career field, went back to school, finished, and, am now waiting to become licensed as an esthetician.  But somewhere between the time it took to receive my test date and the actual wait, I became not so enthused about my new career choice.  I don't know if it's that or the fact that while I was in training, I experienced an array of clients who literally sucked the energy right out of me.  Now, I do want to help others, and consider myself to be a fairly generous person but even I, require a certain amount of space.  I just felt like these people were right in my face, and I guess they kind of were.  Yes, I know there is an adjustment period, time to settle in, time to set the balance with every new career and I do plan to try it out -even if its just part-time for extra money.  The thing is, I want to start building on something.  I want to know that that is what I am supposed to do.  Does anyone ever really know what they are "supposed" to do?  I mean, for the longest time I thought I was supposed to become a doctor.  Everything in me said that was what I was meant to do but I didn't.  The thought hasn't left me, though; one thing at a time, I guess.  I know what I want to do though, what I desire.  I really feel like I am supposed to do those things.  I'm just not sure what those things have to do with my career.  So, back to the job thing, that's what it will be for now -is a job.  Or...you never know -gotta start somewhere.

      Well, I guess the title makes it fairly obvious.  I'm in search of a cool career.  I've applied at several places and have had 1 interview so far.  I want to do something creative.  I have a natural, keen sense for fashion and I've always entertained the idea of pursuing a career in fashion -or, should I say that the idea has always entertained me.  Yes, I am a party-girl and I live for excitement.  I want to have a fun job; is that completely unrealistic?  All I know is that I am terrified of working in another corporate setting where rows of cubicles stretch around corners to meet each other and fluorescent lighting provides the only shield against the freezer-like climate.  I have searched high and low, across the internet and in through the doors of my local career center and, have yet make a solid career connection.  Some seminar on "how to market yourself" is being held in town this week; I guess I'll go to that.  So far I have applied at The Cooper Aerobics Center, Renaissance Laser Hair Removal Centers, MAC cosmetics at Galleria, North Park, and Willowbend, the Spa at Vista Ridge, Some spa in North Dallas, Peace Corps, and even, the Air Force.  I have also applied several places online and have registered for work on several websites including the Texas Workforce site. Since I am waiting to become licensed as an esthetician (which is taking forever), I've made a list of jobs/careers that I see fit for myself at present: Public Relations, Event-Planning, Marketing displays, National or Local Network Intern, National Newspaper Columnist or Intern.  I have a few alternate yet less equitable job ideas.  For instance, I have thought about working at a Starbucks and, there is this really cool, local vineyard that needs help- how romantic is that?  I could just see myself with the wide, brimmed hat, picking fruit from the vines and stomping grapes.  Who knows, maybe they will become really successful and make me a partner.  I could have my own wine; how great would that be?  But, these are just ideas, and I have so many of them.  I need to travel.  I want to create networks of friends and connections.  I want to study other cultures -both wealthy and impoverished.  I want to their languages and teach them all that I know.  And, at the end of each day, I'd write an ethnographic account of my daily experiences -perhaps, I'd use a use a blog.
