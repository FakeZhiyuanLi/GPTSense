      A movie night sounds brilliant, Em.   Yes, the boots  are  rather Melisssa. Is it possible to be in love with footwear? Because I am.  For those of you having problems with extra space in your posts, try using the "Edit HTML" mode instead of "Compose" - it's not giving me problems. I went back and removed all the spaces that were added.

      Add me to the meet up. ^___^ What about a cinema trip? Or shopping? Ooooooh or a movie night!  Blogger is being silly for me too Kit. ;_; What did we do to deserve such treatment?? UNFAIR!

      Just a quick note to let you know I've made Dani an admin now. So if you have any probs and can't get ahold of me... *points at the girl in the Melissa Auf der Maur style boots*  (PS: anyone know why Blogger is putting all these spaces in my posts?? I can't edit them out either...)

      Yay, hi guys. :) I did invite Katy but her invite still says "pending", so I guess she hasn't checked her email lately.    Your new boots sound very cool, Dani - very Melissa Auf der Maur, I  bet! A meet up sounds like a great idea. Any suggestions as to when?    We broke up from college on friday. Yay! No more getting up early!  (Until September, that is.) I don't have many plans for the holidays  either, except the fest with you lot.

      I went out shopping this afternoon, hence why I wasn't online - sorry Em. I got some really cool long black boots. Expensive but awesome!  Plans for the holidays? Well, obviously there's Reading Festival, and then in early August I'm going to Italy for a week with my family. But that's it really. What about you others? Anyone up for a get together sometime soon?

      Hiya! Oooh... this is cool... did you invite the others too? ^_^  If my mum finds me up this late she'll kill me but I don't care, because we're on holiday! Yaaaaaaaaay! *runs around throwing confetti* But I'm getting a bit sleepy now so I might go to bed soon. Don't think I can pull an all nighter. *yawns*
