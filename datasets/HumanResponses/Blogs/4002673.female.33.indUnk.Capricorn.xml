						   Well, had an appointment with a new pediatrician, since we switched insurances and therefore had to find a new doctor.  Arg.  It bugs me that Western doctors treat nonmedical issues as medical issues -- such as "sleeping through the night."  Worldwide, it is normal for kids not to sleep straight through the night until they are 3 or so.  Dd wakes once or twice a night in an 11 hour stretch, the wakings are brief, and since we cosleep she usually just looks to see if we're there, then goes back to sleep on her own.  I think this is completely normal, doc seemed to expect her to sleep straight through 11 hours nonstop.  This is ridiculous -- what ADULT sleeps straight through the night without waking at least once?!  And who cares anyway?  We love our sleeping arrangement and everyone is happy and rested in the morning.  SO who cares if she wakes up briefly once or twice?  Is it even the doctor's business to ask that question?  Also, she seemed perplexed that I'll let dd self-wean (which, by the way, she appears to be doing right now).  I received no encouragement for nursing her for as long as she wants...which is the healthiest, best thing.  I wish pediatricians would read the research and learn about what goes on outside their precious Western medicine paradigm.  When it comes to breastfeeding and cosleeping, I have yet for a doctor or nurse to tell me any correct piece of information.  Since I learnt a lot about these issues while working on my thesis prospectus, I am always way more informed than they are.  What makes me angry is that they continue to dispense advice based on no training or real information, and they say things as though they think they really are the authority on the subject.  Well, they're not, and I will continue the search for a pediatrician who has actually taken the time to read some research.  Different subject -- I mentioned dd is self-weaning.  Amazing.  For the past few days she has only wanted to nurse three times in a 24 hour period.  Each session is very, very brief.  Yesterday it was only twice.  She doesn't nurse in the night anymore -- all of this is completely her own doing, I have never pushed or refused her.  ANd all those people who said she would "never learn to sleep without nursing" if I didn't make her cry...people are so full of crapola.  She is now deciding, of her own little free will, that she has had enough of nursing.  I feel very happy that this is occuring in such a natural, peaceful way.  FATIGUE -- I am so tired!!!!!! FOOD -- I am eating way too much and feeling nauseous much of the time.  That's it for now... Trish

						   Greetings -- My name is Trish.  I am Mom to a 19 month old gorgeous girl and wife to a young Professor at MIT.  I am technically still a graduate student at Harvard, though I just began a year leave of absence so that I can solely concentrate on my family.  I am not a fan of daycare -- there's plenty of research out there which prevents me from enrolling any child of mine into even the "best" of institutions.  My daughter has been by my side throughout the Master's portion of the Harvard program -- this break comes before I begin the Ph.D. portion (IF I go back after the birth of my second child).  This is a high-risk pregnancy, since I developed an extensive blood clot (Deep Vein Thrombosis) during the third trimester of my first pregnancy.  I will have to inject myself with blood thinners twice a day throughout this pregnancy, and my hopes of having a natural childbirth at home are pretty much shot to hell.  My toddler is crawling all over me -- I want to take her to the Children's Museum in Boston, so I'll write more later, or tomorrow.
