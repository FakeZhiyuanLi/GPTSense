      Thought I might write about a wedding I went to on Saturday night. It was for my very good friends Kelly and Danen.  Nicole and I had a BLAST! Beautiful ceremony, beautiful glasses of Champagne, and tasty food! We dance the whole night, until they kicked us out! The band that played, is also playing our wedding,  urlLink King Bee  . They were sooo good! Go check them out if you can. I think they will be @ Cold Springs Tavern on the 5th of September, as well as SoHo on Friday the 10th.   GO CHECK THEM OUT!!   You will not regret it! BTW... BRING YOUR DANCING SHOES!!!!

      I have been playing poker through  urlLink jetsetpoker.com . They have Hold 'Em, Omaha, stud, and PAI GOW! Ya'll might wanna check it out.  Two nights ago I played in a FREE tourney. They gave us 1500 in chips and 500 people were in it. Being the novice player that I am, I figured to place in the 300-400 range. I got some GREAT card the first three hands... I'm talking about full house Q's over J's etc... I quickly put three people all in and took them out. I got moved to a different table with "better" players and rake in enough chips to be in 3rd place @ the time. Little by little I saw what place I was in, and how many people were left. I finished   57th  ! I was very excited to say the least. So watch out for "gotkevin" sitting @ a table near you!

      Drafted my first fantasy football team for the '04 season. I am pretty happy with it. Got TO, Holt, and Santana Moss @ the WR position. Priest Holmes (My Dogg) was the first pick, which I had! Well see how this goes with NO MONEY involved!  Got another draft coming up on the 21st, so I need to go and study!   urlLink My Homepage
