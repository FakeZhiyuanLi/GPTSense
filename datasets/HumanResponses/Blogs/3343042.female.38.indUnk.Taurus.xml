      I am walking and thinking about the ego. I am wondering what an ego would like if it were a tangible thing. What would mine look like? I think perhaps like a walnut. Small, hard, and permanently wrinkled.   I am not now with my atrophied little ego who I was then....Great job in a great city. The youngest in my office to be promoted to my level of responsibility. Sushi for lunch and a little basket for everything on my desk. Funky shoes and umbrella.   I understood the political art of the staff meeting, the importance of perception. Of a confident, gently swinging foot and a faint smile. A beautiful pen. Of rain beating down outside, the room lit gently and the faint, cicada buzz of the central air conditioning. Consuming my own carefully constructed, exotic snacks. Not a bagel eater, I. Yams, nuts and honey, persimmons and dates, hard-boiled brown eggs paired with a tiny crystal salt shaker. By turns a curiosity, an amusement, even an irritant to my colleagues. I brought out the emotion of others. I said things that others thought but would never express. Sometimes, I was unkind. That was my role. I didn't know it. Some others did, I think.  Total confidence in all that I undertook, even the mundane. For example, I had perfected the art of getting a seat on the subway. I learned, through several years of adapting to the urban rhythm, how to position myself exactly in front of a set of double doors by calculating the relationship between the decreasing speed of the incoming train and my position relative to the end of the platform. I almost never had to stand.  I was on a leash, yes, but a long one. I could enjoy the illusion of freedom that eluded so many others I knew. It's true that I was not loved by all, but I knew I was respected. That was what mattered most to me. I really considered myself lucky.

      I am making my weekly trip to the local Salvation Army. Husband in the city doing corporate, three-martini lunch sorts of things. I have a couple of hours before I need to begin the  dinner routine, and I have a few extra bucks in my wallet. I must buy something.  I don't know why I love this place so much. I feel at home here, scouting out deals on an old lady's forgotten-in-the-attic Pyrex and FireKing. Books with loving inscriptions to people who threw them away. Jigsaw puzzles that will end up shoved under the bed in the guestroom.   I am looking at the books, touching them as I always do in the process of making a decision. I like acid-free papers and smooth  covers. Beautiful books. I am much engrossed in this work when I see on the periphery of my vision someone standing next to me. I look over, and it is a man. Taller than me, but not that much so. Sandy blondish hair, bright blue-green eyes. Tattoo on his left forearm. He is slightly sunburned. He looks pleasant and menacing at the same time.   I am very conscious of knowing that I don't want to be rude - don't want to move away for some imagined overture. He is perfectly nice, I'm sure. It's me who's out of practice living in the world. He smiles at me. Asks me if I've found anything good. He is holding a novel by John Irving, one I have not yet read.    I am shy, but I am also intrigued. It occurs to me that I haven't had a conversation about anything literary in quite some time. I begin to feel a warmth in my face and hands as I start spouting John Irving trivia from a place inside me that I had forgotten about. We talk about the bears, the Austria settings. Garp. We laugh a bit. Is it my imagination or can I actually feel the heat from his body? No, of course not. Only in movies. I have chosen two lovely books, one on the life of a real geisha. I show him the beautiful cover.   All of a sudden I am overcome with self-consciousness. The tattoo scares me. I see his lunch bag, the pathetic brown sack of a laborer. I am embarrassed. I am married. What would my husband say if he saw? Why did I think this, I don't know. He could never see, never know. This is my moment. I want it. I can talk to whoever I please. But my self-consciousness keeps rising and the moment is gone. The man wants to keep talking, he's just talking to me about books. But I smile in that way I've learned that comes with flashing a wedding ring.   I tell him politely that I think I've found what I want, these two books. We say goodbye and I move to the cash register. For some time he remains on the edge of my vision. Is he slowly following me around the store? I pay and leave, walking quickly. After I turn the corner and pass the Chinese restaurant, I look back. He is not there. He did not follow me. I am ashamed.

      ...or so I think it's supposed to go. Spent the afternoon outside painting fences and watching my neighbor, a woman with two small children and a minivan. Her house is perfect. I met her once last summer at a yard sale and she told me she was an artist. She seemed so interesting. I was so bored with my life then and so desperate for companionship that I didn't even bother to ask what media. I just wanted a smart, funny, stylish friend to confide in and laugh with. An artist. We don't have too many of those out here.  Since then, I've seen her from time to time emerging through her freshly painted front door. She always looks busy with the children and totally absorbed in whatever errand she's on her way to do. Very rarely does she look up or around. She usually wears a loose-fitting kind of blouse in a pastel shade, sunglasses pushed high up on her head, and comfortable shoes.   Then today I watched in stunned horror as she meticulously swept her driveway, the sidewalk, and then the actual road in front of her perfect house. Never looking up or around. Totally absorbed in the task at hand. It scared me and I wanted to run across the street and shake her, make her stop cleaning cleaning cleaning.     I opened a lite beer and regarded my dirt and paint-encrusted feet. I hoped she wouldn't see me and come over. I hoped she would. I wanted to ask her, what was her media?

      I've been searching for a job these past few months, after finally accepting the fact that I cannot work with my husband AND be married to him. After being employed steadily for ten years, it's very difficult to get out and start interviewing. I worry that I'm too old for the job market - God, when did I start considering myself too old for things? I worry that I'm overweight and will make a bad impression, as of someone who will spend afternoons grazing in the staff room refrigerator instead of writing up crucial reports. I worry that I've lost my polish, having been "gone so long."  I have found a position that is perfect for me. It incorporates all of my skills from past and present, and offers enormous growth potential. It's also with a prestigious institutions, and I know that, quite frankly, I could be "set for life" if chosen for the job. My chest ached when I took a test drive by the building and  gazed up at the windows, projecting myself into the future. There I would be, draped in fine linen from J. Jill or Chico's, slightly funky but always the respected professional. And there would be my cherished Christmas Cactus by the window, and my books piled around it. I would be in a meeting, and I could see myself through that window, laughing and gesturing graciously, enjoying the process, the moment.   When I received notice that I had actually been chosen for an interview, my knees went weak. My opportunity at last. I prepared for several days, putting my "book" together and reviewed some technical skills referred to in the position description. I researched the company and gained an understanding of its mission and goals. I was ready.   But when I walked into the interview yesterday, everything changed. The group was much different from what I had expected -- three perfectly polite but rather aloof interviewers. No offer of a glass of water. Nobody seemed to have a copy of my resume on top of their stack of papers, or a list of questions. They started the questioning away, no small talk. No humor or attempt to make me comfortable whatsoever. And novice questions, too, such as "What's your greatest weakness?"   "Oh, God," I remember thinking.   Like a tidal wave, I was hit by a wall of fear. I could feel my breathing become shallow, could feel my cheeks burning, could hear the awful noise of my tongue clapping against the inside of my dry mouth. I knew I must be making an impression similar to that of a beached cod.  I was flooded with embarrassment, and I couldn't stop talking. I talked and talked, and although I responded to their questions as best I could, I had difficulty hearing throught the pounding in my ears, and I knew I wasn't giving my Sunday-best answers.   I realize only now what it was that frightened me so terribly. I had understood then, consciously, that I was no longer a person who saw the world as full of possibility. That somewhere along the way I had become a person who understood that things in life are finite, and that opportunities are limited and must be snatched at all costs before they disappear. I was a foreigner to myself at that moment, much as an old woman with a young mind is foreign to her own papery, blue-veined mirror image. And in that moment of foreigness and fright -- not of the present but of the future -- I lost my bearings. Lost my way, and my confidence with it.  So now I wait. Wait to see if I've made the second round. The cut. I am terrifed. I am defiant. I challenge them to NOT want me. Their loss. I will cry if offered the job, I know it. I want it, I want them. I hate them for not bringing my resume and a set of thoughtful questions to the interview. I envy them the positions they already hold. I am full of feelings and thoughts that chase each other around in my head.   I will wait and think, one minute confident and the next devastated. This is what it is to feel, for the first time in my life, the heavy weight of desperation.

      Back in college and a couple of years beyond into a tentative adulthood, I used to watch a television show called "ThirtySomething." Bloggers of my generation (not "X") will remember the sophisticated soaper tracing the lives of a group of  ex-ivy league suburbanites that ran at 10 pm on Monday nights, and for which I waited with great anticipation each week.   I think back on this now, remembering my fixation on the characters, the need to see the program and follow every turn of plot -- and the terrible disappointment when the show was occasionally preempted by an interminable sports event.   Why, at the age of twenty-odd, did I feel so connected to these thirtysomethings? Shouldn't I have been out getting tattooed or drinking brown-bagged beers in the park with friends my own age? I've wondered about this strange keening for many years, and have never been able to understand it. Until today, when for some unknown reeason my subconscious spat up a vivid aural memory of the soundtrack - a very unique piece of folky jazzy funk by (yes, I do remember from the credits) a certain V. Snuffy Walden.   I was standing in my living room, contemplating whether or not to make the cup of coffee which would of course entice me to smoke a cigarette that I really didn't want or need, when the notes rang so clearly in my head I was momentarily stunned. Taken back to the place on my old sofa, years and years ago, where I would sit transfixed for that magical hour. And I knew at that moment why I loved them so much, that group of over-educated, well-dressed suburbanites whose conservative values I should have been scoffing.  They were seven in all, interconnected by blood, college friendships, and professional partnerships. They all had silky, freshly washed hair and looked great in sweats. Many of the programs boasted extended shots of the friends, lounging around in combed cotton outfits and toting designer beers with which they gesticulated as they argued the origins of the cosmos.   Hope, stay-at-home-mom (by choice) wife of Michael, had beautiful, silky hair and always appeared stylish in her rag socks and sweats. Her biggest problem, as I recall, was a brief period of professional unrest after the birth of their perfect baby, Janie. Or maybe the time she lactated in a restaurant, ruining her silk shirt and embarrassing herself in front of her inlaws. The rest of their stories were similar; frustrations with assistant professorships, trouble getting gallery showings, all-nighters spent coming up with brillian ad campaigns that would take them to the top. There was no such thing as canned ravioli or second-hand clothes for them.   There was no mentally ill mother, lying in bed each evening, eating crackers from the box. Face lit feebly by the bluish glow of the television posted at the end of the bed. Silence but for the endless dialogue of sci-fi movies and the occasional boom of a loud commercial break.  The thirtysomethings made me feel safe. Safe because they seemed to hold out such promise for the future. Here was a group of people who were careening towards forty, and then from there, death? And yet they had full lives, good lives. Friends and confidences and satisfying, artsy jobs that somehow always seemed to jive with their ultimate conservatism. No wrinkles in the fabric of their lives.   They had beautiful children and homes that always looked fabulous even through renovation, illness, and temporary periods of unemployment. The staged mess of toys on the living room sets always looked cozy. The husbands were well-groomed and articulate. I must have thought to myself back then that this was what I could have, too. That it was possible for me to  live a good life, clean and orderly. They were showing me how.   I hung on the characters' words, and even starting wearing rag socks. I brushed my hair out in the silky manner of my celuloid role models, and took up baking. I drank the same beer, scouring the gourmet emporiums for the same brands I saw them holding. And I did all of this without thinking about it. It never impeded my functioning in any way, and my life continued along its path as it otherwise would have. These little changes were a kind of private security, like the blankets little children drag around for comfort. This fascination lasted about two years, from my senior year in college with the alcoholic boyfriend who told me during sex that he wished I was someone else - to the year after when I lived, frightened and alone, for the first time in a small apartment in the top corner of a crumbling brick building.   Towards the end of the program's run, the producers started to become desperate about slipping ratings. They gave one character cancer (from which she recovered after losing her silky hair), and killed another off in a freak auto accident. I remember that I cried that night, feeling actual loss.   As I recall, I began to lose interest in the program during its last season, and by the time it was finally cancelled, I had missed several episodes. I don't remember if this was because, as is the case with most dying series, the plot line had deteriorated to the point of embarrassing implausibility, or if my sporadic work schedule was keeping me away from the television. Or, perhaps I was handling my grief through denial, pretending to myself that these old friends no longer mattered because I knew they were leaving.  In any case, I remember that I felt a sense of relief - of peace - when I read in the paper that the show would not return the following season. I know now that it was a peace similar to the relief one feels on the passing of a terminally ill friend.  A relief similar to the exhausted hours after a break up that was long in the coming, when one partner is simply ready to move on and will not be kept.   Now I am thirtysomething, and I laugh to myself when I think back on those naive years of mine. I still wear rag socks, still bake, still drink designer beer. But these things do not protect me, nor do I expect them to. I own my own home now, but it looks nothing like any of theirs. I don't lactate involuntary, but I do have plenty of stained and unfashionable clothing hiding in my closets. And although my professional aspirations border on the artsy, I am far more affected by a stagnant economy and international turmoil than my old friends ever seemed to be. But I do miss them, now that I am nearly older and wiser. I would have much to tell them about where I've been.

      Mornings at my grandmother's house, waking to the sound of Polka Radio in the kitchen and the smell of bacon. Me sitting, legs swinging, eating the scrambled eggs she knew I loved. Drinking the prune juice she poured at dawn after rising to set the table and begin another day.   She never danced to the radio, but she was immersed in the music. She worked silently, smiling up at me occasionally from the stove or the sink. The sun would pour through the two big windows, across the table, and over the polished floor in big stripes. The polkas would play until noon, or was it only eleven? I never wanted to leave the table and break the spell.   My grandmother wore bright rouge on her cheeks and lips every day, because in her time a woman did not leave the house unless she was made up. She pincurled her hair every night and colored it, too, although she refused to admit it. So even when she was outside at 85 years of age, raking leaves in hard-soled felt slippers, woolen coat, and flowered babushka, she was rosy-cheeked and pink-lipped. Nearly still a debutante. I loved her enormously. Her and her Polka Radio.

      What I hate most about the job search is the emotional lability of it all. Down all day, feeling grumpy and passed over. The phone silent. Damn phone. Sitting under the umbrella in the backyard, sweating and feeling grossly overweight. Yet always knowing that everything could change in a second. The phone rings, the interview is requested, confirmed. Happy happy me. Valued again. Am I really so desperate for validation? Why can't I sit happily alone, reading a good book? Isn't this what I wanted, after all? I am really turned off by myself today. No looking in the mirrors.

      Yesterday, we knocked down the rotting storage shed behind the house. It had stood, slowly decaying, on its sad little spot since before anyone in the neighborhood could recall. Since years and years before we bought the house. Probably before I was born. Simple plywood painted a simple brown. A pattern on its left side where a window might, but was not ever, inserted.    Deep within its earthy-smelling dark were a few rusting treasures, long forgotten. Nothing special or even curious. One of these was a long, rectangular box standing on end. Bathed in sunlight as the near wall came down, the box revealed itself to be an old steamer trunk. It was in an intermediate state of decay, its leather handles eaten through with moisture and time. The latches crusted with rust and mineral deposits.   A faded shipping label, still readable, was gummed to the underside of the trunk:  Dr. Lionel Friedman 27 Mulberry Close Cambridge, England  After dragging the albatross down to the curb, I pondered who Lionel Friedman was, and why his trunk was in my shed. Had he lived here? Had he thought he would come back for it some time? And if so, why hadn't he? Perhaps something had happened to the young doctor, something untoward and sinister which prevented him from coming back. Perhaps he was dead and this trunk his only legacy.    Perhaps the trunk was a sad reminder of a love affair gone flat, a trip planned but never taken. The shed a punishment for the scapegoated, memory-laden piece of luggage.  Or perhaps he had simply discarded the trunk as useless once he had returned to the States to settle down with his new wife, who he knew abhorred clutter. So he had banished the box to the new storage shed behind the house where it should remain until forgotten and rediscovered by determined home-improvers who were mere babes when it was manufactured.   I'm sure I'll never know.

      Trouble sleeping last night because my husband came home late, intoxicated, and left the living room lamp on. We are drying two huge oriental rugs by spreading them across the furniture. He was afraid of tripping on them while reaching to turn off the light, or so he says. Left it on for safety's sake. I say he was just drunk and probably made a wise decision in not overestimating the already taxed limits of his balance. Just tell me the truth.  This is not an entry about a woman who wonders where her husband goes. I'm not at all jealous, an unusual trait for a woman that I much admire in myself. I actually do believe him when he tells me he goes out only for professional reasons. He's really quite a homebody. To be honest, I enjoy his evenings away, the quiet, the temporarily suspended monologue he always seems to be engaged in.   So I went to bed at a reasonable hour after a movie about the life of Dorothy Parker and a solitary dinner of salad topped with a lean piece of ground beef. I will admit, however, that I drank too much white wine and smoked too many cigarettes. Lay in bed listening to an Isabel Allende book on tape, then drifted off.   When he came home, he was very quiet, which meant that he was either quite sober or very drunk and fearful of my waking wrath. I slept fitfully until 4:14, when I finally got out of bed to turn off the living room light. I stood looking out the front door into the bluing early morning, wondering what the coming day would hold. I never know anymore. Trying to remain cheerful and smiling, all the while my stomach churning while I wonder how much longer we can go on with only one income.   Returning to bed, sleep is a fantasy. I toss and turn, and as the sky outside the window bleeds from cobalt to cornflower to steel gray, I curl up and hug my knees. Anxiety hits me in waves, through which I try to breathe slowly and evenly. "I know this, I know this," I say to myself. "It will pass." But I am bombarded with the loneliness of the hour, the possibility of death, of illness, of that lump in the breast. Or if not that, then the misery of an old age spent in poverty, dependent on the love of a fickle tabby cat and the polite but disinterested daily exchange with the mail man. I do not want this to be me.

      I was reminded yesterday of a particular episode of "Laverne and Shirley" in which Shirley is unemployed and desperate for work. As the days go by and the phone doesn't ring with promises of employment, Shirley begins to slowly unravel. Between detergent and Twinkies commercials, we see her decompensate into a dishevelled mess of dirty bathrobe and slippers. Prettied up for the prime time camera, of course, but we get the picture.   At some point, Laverne comes home to find Shirley has disassembled the phone, and is surrounded by its parts. Fascinated in a distant kind of way, surveying her hard work. Much canned laughter here.   That was my day yesterday -- minus the canned laughter. I spent the afternoon creating the perfect pantry. At first, I only wanted to straighten it out a bit, line up my boxes of falafel mix behind the shorter items so I could see everything better. But the project took on a life of its own, and I found myself emptying the pantry, cleaning shelves and floor repeatedly. Scrutinizing expiration dates and the viscosity of ancient jars of jam. Then reorganizing by type of food. Finally, I loaded up my gluttonous little label maker with the required (six!) batteries and commenced labelling the sections of my pantry, taping the labels to the fronts of the newly cleaned wooden shelves. Standing back to admire my perfect pantry, Stepford Wife-like.  I am currently engaged in a job search. Each day, I'm sure the phone will ring with promises of employment. But it doesn't. And because I have absolutely no aptitude for disassembling my compact cordless phone with its solid construction and teeny tiny Japanese screws, I clean my pantry. Drawers. Corners. Small spaces that I know I can bring under control and dominate indefinitely. These are my victories. Until, that is, my phone rings again.

      It's been three weeks since my last posting. I've been away again, out to sea. Not literally, of course. Just hanging around the house and moping - a surprisingly  immature response to losing out on the position I was so sure I had won.     It was, I'm fairly certain, an internal candidate who was chosen. That makes me feel a bit better, but still it's a loss. So now I'm back to square one. I know that eventually I will find a great position with the company, whose overall values and mission match my own. The thing is, I realize that I'm hanging all of my hopes on finding a job which will shape my life, instead of relying on the shape of my life to point me towards the right job. This disturbs me. I feel weak and marginalized, and very ashamed that I've sunk so low. This truly is a bleak time for me professionally. What happened to all the self-confidence I once had? Is it a product of aging to lose it?     I wake in the mornings and the first thing I find myself thinking about are my failures. Failure to make substantial money the last three years, resulting in financial hardship for both myself and my husband. Failure to publish the book - or at least the novella - I told myself I would have by this time. Failure to think positively each day, pressing forward with (as I've been hearing a lot recently during this presidential race) "hope and optimism." I wonder what the hell is wrong with me, anyway.     Well, one thing I must admit. I do know that I am depressed again. A condition I have suffered with on and off for most of my life. I took various medications for several years and I did experience some relief - but I gained about thirty-five pounds. I guess I was truly "fat and happy" for a while there. But after a couple of years, the effects of the medication lessened, leaving me just "fat." So I weaned myself off, having decided that "fat and medicated" was not the answer, either.     Now I'm back to my fighting weight, which is a relief. But I feel the old mood swings, the irritability, hopelessness, the total inability to see a bright future. I see it as my responsibility to overcome the depression in more holistic ways. Exercise, proper nutrition, a consistent sleep schedule all help. But this unemployment issue is upstaging all of my efforts on my own behalf.     I am going away for a few weeks with my husband, overseas. I have mixed feeling about this trip, given my renewed struggle with the black dog ( as depression is often referred to by those in the know.) I'm trying to force myself to instill special meaning into this opportunity - to get something out of it that I can use to buoy myself and bounce back. And besides, how many people get to lick their wounds on the beach in Europe? It could be much worse for me, I know. I feel a bit like the poor little rich girl, complaining like this. Although, of course, I'm nowhere near rich. Just better off than some of my friends and neighbors.     So I'm putting on my happy face, determined that my husband will not know how desperate I am. I see how hard he is working to keep things together, and I'm flooded with guilt over the stress I am causing him. And it makes me feel even worse that he is often the target of my mood swings and negativity. Not that doesn't often deserve a sharp word, as he is prone to a certain amount of arrogance - a trait in his personality that I've noticed with growing sadness over the past few years. Still, his changing (or is it emerging?) personality is no excuse for me to lose control of myself.    We have a certain distance between us now, as a result. I have developed strong (albeit sometimes knee-jerk) defenses, and will often opt to ignore him totally instead of engaging in a discussion which poses the risk of having to engage in a full-blown argument that will last an entire evening. So my happy face, as it were, is not just the mask of a devoted wife. It's the mask of a tired wife.     Nevertheless, in one week I will be flying away from my current problems. I'm blessedly immersed in the process of packing, which keeps me from thinking too much about the current state of my professional affairs. Because we will be gone for a month, it is rather a big job. And there are, of course, so many things to be taken care of with regard to the household before we depart.     One thing I have decided is that I will write a travelogue of my experiences. I've been on this trip many times, and have always meant to document it. I believe I could actually publish such a piece - although that's not my primary motivation for writing it. What I most want is to take a vacation from myself. To process and express the world from a different angle. To stop ruminating, if only for a few weeks, about my failings as a human being.

      I'm still slogging through the interview process, having now completed two rounds of interviews, submitted a portfolio, and pulled together my professional references. And I still don't know a thing. The strange thing about this whole process has been my uncanny ability to predict every detail about how it would work. I predicted with dead-on accuracy how long it would take for them to contact me for an interview. By dead-on I mean to the exact day. Then, I predicted correctly who would be sitting on my round one interview committee. And my round two committee. I have had every indication, based on the speed of the process, the makeup of the various committees, and the request (plus an email reminder, lest I forget) for references, to assume that I am the final candidate.   However, I have had some mixed messages from the committee member who I have dubbed "the maven." Sixteen years at the company and in direct control of its finances. Round one revealed her as sweet and patient, and I left thinking her an advocate. Round two revealed much the same, but with a twist, In a sweet and breathy way, she opened the session by letting me know how pushed for time they were, due to the "marathon" of interviews lined up that day. My interview was to be only half an hour due to the chaos which I'm not entirely certain was raging outside the conference room doors. Upon concluding the interview, she took my hand in hers in a farewell shake, paused and looked so sweetly into my face. Then she told me that "this is going to be such a difficult decision. We've had so many great people." Shocker! I had been entirely convinced that I was the final candidate. Why else had they been so adament about obtaining my references?   I retained my composure and thanked the maven, then carried myself as gracefully as I could out of the building, my head spinning with the sharp blow of this revelation. Could it be that the committee was simply inviting everyone back for a second interview and collecting references from all? That was the impression the maven was trying to make. But surely not. References are usually collected only when a final candidate has been chosen. But then, I remembered, this committee had not seemed terribly organized and accustomed to the process. Perhaps they were in the habit of choosing candidates based on references. Unusual, but not unthinkable. Although disappointed, I do comfort myself with the knowledge that my references are impeccable, and the extra time I took to personalize my portfolio specifically for the committee was a miracle move on my part. So even if it is the case that I wasn't in the lead at the time of my second interview, I will be now. That's what I tell myself.   I also tell myself another story, one that, as it shaped itself in my consciousness and burst forth, literally stopped me in my tracks. Perhaps I am in fact the final candidate and the maven is just playing with my head in an effort to destabilize me. To make me desperate and grateful to accept a salary lower than what I otherwise would have. Yes, the more the maven realizes I am the person for the position, the more she manipulates to keep her costs down. This must be it - I know it. Everything else has fallen into place.   I will also say this. I have been moved to tears in the past week by the return of a confidence that I thought was gone forever, and by the loyal rallying of colleagues who I know have not forgotten me and my contributions. There is a part of me which now doesn't even care so much about getting this position. Just having made it so far into what is obviously a highly competitive process is an honor in itself.   Moreover, I am now certain of my desirability in the marketplace, and know that I will find an extraordinary opportunity somewhere, somehow if I keep at it. I know that I continue to make my own life on my own terms, and that my reinvention has been a success, after all. My perspective has sharpened, and the feedback I receive from the world around tells me that everything really will be alright. I trust myself again. And I rejoice.
