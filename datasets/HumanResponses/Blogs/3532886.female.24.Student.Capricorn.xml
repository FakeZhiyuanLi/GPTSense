      i have hideous feet.  it used to really bother me and i used to want to cut them off and start over.     but it's mainly just my toes, rather than my feet.  my feet from the base of my toes up to my ankles are quite nice actually.  i do have extremely high arches (very nearly a ninety degree angle) and my heels are as charming as heels can possibly be (but how charming  is  that, exactly?).    but my toes ... they're almost mutant toes.  each one looks like it came off a different foot.  they all seem to point in a different direction, and they all look like they got run over by a bus.  twice.  but it would be a crime not to draw something as hideous as my right foot, because it's just so fascinating that anything in the world can even  be  so ugly.   urlLink

      i've started sleeping grown up hours again.  this means waking up at eight like a grown up and going to bed at eleven (and i even had coffee this morning).  and it's about time too.  i was starting to grow fangs (but i've always been afraid of the light).  everyone in my house wants to stab me with my hot pink hi-liter pen while i sleep (not really.  well i hope not).  i've been playing the "i can't do the dishes or wash your clothes or do anything else at all because i've got homework to do" card more than i should have.  ken's green eyes are shooting green kryptonic rays every day.  i'm such a bad girl (but he loves it and that's why he puts up with me).  and i can't blame work for my lack of duty at home.  though i do, literally, do it all at the country store / post office / gas station / and so on.  yes, i am a postmistress by day and a temptress of one (or more) superhero(s) by night.  actually i am more than a postmistress (or postal wench, as i like to call myself)-: oh yes, oregon is one of the only two states in which pumping your own gas is illegal, so i am the pump girl as well.  i also sell the toofless loggers their beer to drink on their way home after a hard day of clear cutting through the breathtaking oregon woods (please don't try to alert me to the moral and ethical implications of this, as i am already aware-: we do also sell toothbrushes, but i can't force them, can i?).  oh, but wait!  there's more!  i can also notarize.  and every holiday, i paint the windows (actually every holiday i  say  i'll paint the windows and i never do.  but this next holiday will be different!).  i also make a serious cup of coffee.  oh, and i'm also a licensed fish & wildlife agent.  i tell people what they can and can't kill.  and i do it all with a smile (those of you who have never met me must know how unbelievable this is).    if i were any more all-purpose i'd be spam.  i finished all my coursework as of yesterday, so i have nothing left to blame my laziness on.    i've been painting a little bit, though.  nothing finished.  i'm working on a very special (and very large) oil piece right now.  largest i've done, so it will probably take a very long time.  i've also been playing with ink and gouache.  but oil paint is my bitch.  and she gets very jealous.  i suppose i shall play with her after work.  ken took me to a standup comedy competition this past weekend.  i haven't laughed so hard in months.  i needed it.

       urlLink    sister, i   sister, i breathe you.  you do not breathe, you  do not breathe, i breathe you.   sister, i tried to.  you were too blue, you   were too blue, and plastic.   sister, i cried you.  you were not there, you  did not taste cool, damp cheek.   sister, i wonder.  you were so pure, you  were so true, so blue-eyed.   sister, i bled you.  it was our blood, it  was our blood.  i shed you.   sister, i miss you.  you had to go, you  had to go.  i know this.

      who in the world am i?  well, the man who belongs to those words is dead, so he's not actually anybody in the world.  the man he used to be is lewis carroll.    but  i  am still of this world (i think), and it's much more important for me to figure out who  i  am.  i don't expect blog to figure that out for me (unless they offer that option.  is there a 'who am i' button on the taskbar?  did i miss it?).  i don't even expect  myself  to figure that out (ever).  but hey, why not have some laughs while i air my humiliations and personal anguish on a website that anyone with half a brain and a modem has access to?   god, this is the hardest introduction i've ever had to write.  oh the pressure!  what do i say?    i can't believe i'm doing this.  i scoffed at the first blog i stumbled upon (but of course i wanted one).  it's like a little egomaniacal present to myself.  i feel so dirty.   well, i was going to say some more meaningful stuff, but i'm far too impatient!  i want to be in print!  oh man, i'm gonna be  so  famous, as soon as i click 'publish post'...

       urlLink    New Jersey  Sturdier bridges have traversed wider waters, and (perhaps) have also been immortalized on calendars and in romance novels  (but we've never been to one).  Icy tarmac in the shade from December till your birthday, but still... always wearing the wrong shoes for slippery.  Always.  Dodging tears, dropping like flavored kisses onto lips stained white from biting teeth and Chinook,  fingers brushing and grazing over the knots and chasms of swollen wood-- decorated with crossmyhearts just as weathered.  Whispering something about apertures. Open wide, and ready to click.  All flash and dazzle, but now-- time to find home.  Chinook bites harder and joints stiffen as you wrap me up in a jersey of the team I hate.  Melting from the inside out.  New warmth is immortal.
