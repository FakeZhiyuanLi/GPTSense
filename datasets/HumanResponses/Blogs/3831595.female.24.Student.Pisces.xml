      Okay, here's the thing... It has been suggested by many...  e unum plurbis,  if you will... that perhaps I should make this be my regular journal so that y'all can comment on it. I have given it much thought and have decided that over the course of several days, I shall make this change. But knowing how lazy all my friends are, I'm not going to hold my breath on those comments. :)  Oh, and for those of you who are sitting there pondering the Latin above... possibly with a quarter out smirking victoriously over my published mistake and thinking about your first comment (which, undoubtedly would read something like this: "Haven't you even seen a quarter in your life? You misquoted it... it should be  e plurbis unum  you moron. Har har har."), it was a joke. A play on words, if you will. So the joke, my friend, is on you. Har har har.  Yeah... you still don't get it, do you? I took the phrase "From one comes many" and changed it to "From many comes one" showing that all you people thought that you had been the first to email me about "your" idea, when in reality, my inbox had been flooded by people with the  very same  idea. Clever, but you're still scratching you're head, I know. Why do I even bother?  Anyway, this weekend should go by rather quickly. I have rehearsal tomorrow morning (at last!), which should be fun. I was able to get in a lot of practice time this week so, despite my rather cynical start of this entry, I have been in a pretty good mood. I even reorganized my music. Yeah, I'm a nerd.  The big event for the week was a trip to Tri-County Mall. Well, not the trip itself, but the events that unfolded. Matt and I were in the food court minding our own business eating dinner, as normal people do in public places. Out of nowhere, this little kid comes up and helps himself to my food! So I look over towards his mother (who appears to be younger than me) and she's too busy looking at her shoe while her  other  three kids run around the food court to notice. I was sooo mad!!!  The other big even was that I got called for jury duty. On the same day as Liz. What are the odds? Well, as it turns out, I don't have to do it because I don't live in Hamilton County anymore. But those were still some pretty freaky odds, if you ask me.  Well, I'm all talked out for the night. I think I shall work on my composition a bit more and then go to bed. Talk to all you kiddies later!

      Summer classes are over and I passed that wretched biology class. Oh, and they still haven't updated my major.

      So yeah... I've been trying to get the education department to fix my major since May.  I have my acceptance letter to the ed dept. and they still haven't changed my major to Music Ed.  I emailed Leslie and she said that they would take care of it, but that was in the middle of May and it's still not taken care of.  I wouldn't be too concerned, but I vaguely remeber Alison saying something about them having Christian registered wrong and they hassled him about it.  Gotta love the ed dept...

      Not too much time today to write, but here goes...  I have a gazillion things to do today before the rehearsal dinner. A gazillion - that would be the  urlLink actual count .  The  urlLink wedding  is tomorrow and we still have a lot of loose ends to tie up.  After that, we head to Vegas and LA and won't be back until August 22nd. Just in time to start school the next day. Bah.  Don't worry if you didn't get an invite, we'll  urlLink accept your gift anyway . We're good like that.  Okay, well I'm out for now. If I don't get a chance to update this tomorrow, talk to you on the 22nd!

      So, as most of you know, I  sadly  didn't seem to be able to schedule an ensemble in my schedule this final semester of classes.  As much as it hurts me to say , I have reached the maximum credit hours allowed by the university and, again,  SADLY  I was unable to register for band. So I have composed a list of things that I will miss for your perusal:  1.  There ya go. And now I will make a rather short list of things that got me through last year: 1. Laughing with Brandon. 2. Text messaging Loni across the band. 3. Trying not to breathe (if you need an explanation,  urlLink email me ). 4. Three words: Symphonic Winds Bingo. 5. Watching Brandon and Johnnie take turns leaving rehearsal. 6. Staring at the clock, trying to determine if it was actually working. 7. Counting how many times I blink in a 2-hour period. 8. Watching Brandon try to pick fights ("Have  you  seen the movie Dr. Karrick?). 9. Being able to actually feel the love for music sucked out of me as we were constantly berated and told exactly why we were never going to amount to anything. 10. Constantly reminding myself that it is almost over.  Can't wait to go back to school...

      Well, I attempted to make cookies today... forgot what I was doing and took a shower.  When I got out there was smoke pouring out of the stove and the cookies were burnt to the pan.  The entire building -not just our apartment- stinks.  I think the neighbors hate me.

      As I type this, there is a stray cat sitting outside the door to my apartment.  I have been sneezing, my eyes are watering, and my throat is sore.  And the stupid thing isn't even actually in the apartment!  So I had to pick my dad up at the airport yesterday.  I saw something interesting while I waited for him: An old lady chased her suitcase all the way around the baggage claim.  Seriously, she went around it and then some.  Why didn't she just stay in one place and wait for it to come to her?  I could have helped her. But I didn't.  On that note, I shall go to bed.  Gotta rest up for the alterations brawl tomorrow.  Oh, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAVE AND STEPHANIE!!!!!

      For those who check out  urlLink the site , I have added to the "Funny Stuff" page tonight. I also made a small change to the main page, nothing earth-shattering, but an update all the same.

      Well, my friends, it was another sleepless night last night. I had  Misty  stuck in my head and it was preventing me from my much-needed sleep. I'm up now and I have played through it a few times on the piano, so I am hoping to get in a nap before my dad flies in.  During the little sleep that I had, I had a dream about a parade, and (judging by my sore throat), I am fairly certain that I was singing  Stars and Stripes Forever .  I'm so odd...  Anyway, this week is gonna be a crazy one, that's for sure. My dad flies in today and there's Divisional Band tonight. I have to pick my dress up from the VERY RUDE alterations people on Wednesday, the rehearsal dinner is on Friday, the wedding is on Saturday, and we fly out to Vegas on Sunday. Add to that, all the little errands I have to do, and you've got yourself a pretty hectic week.  My summer is more or less over since the day after we return from the honeymoon, I start back to school. How sad.  A'ight, I have to get going for now... more exciting updates soon! :)

      Let's add a third apology for Scott.  I apparently didn't know his first name either.  I have found out that his name was actually John Smith.  How could I have forgotten a name like that?

      Today has been a nice day off work. Actually, I don't have to go back to work until we get back from our honeymoon. Nice, how I milked an extra week out of it, eh?  I've been in a rather reflective mood today (I hope that doesn't mean that I am dying), and I feel that there have been some people in my life that I owe apologies. So, in no particular order, here they are:   To Chris Wilson, or Wickson (additional apology: I can't seem to remember your last name - If you're reading this and you were the kid who wore a tie to school every day in 6th grade, this is probably you, it's too big of a coincidence to not be): I apologize for laughing at you when you asked me out. Not because I actually laughed as I said no, but because of the reason that I laughed. You had ketchup on your face and I didn't tell you. I've been carrying that guilt with me for the past 13 years.  To Robin Yaski: When we were in first or second grade, my friends and I would follow you around the playground saying "BOOM" whenever you walked, and would scream "EARTHQUAKE" when you tried to run away from us. On behalf of the whole gang, we are sorry. It's just that you were the first overweight person any of us had ever seen in person. I am sure that you have lost the weight since then.  To Scott Murphy (Okay, I made that last name up, I can't seem to remember yours either): I am sorry that my friends and I spent most of Homecoming freshman year hiding from you in the bathroom. You were just really creepy. I am sure that you have outgrown it, or have been arrested since then.  To the lunch ladies at Anderson High School: I apologize for intentionally crumpling up my money into a large ball whenever I paid for my lunch. I am even more sorry for pretending not to know what you were pointing at when you ever-so-rudely would point to the "Please unfold your money" sign taped to the side of your cash register.  To the girl that stood next to me in chorus at Colonial Elementary: I am sorry that I had faster reflexes than you, which resulted in the girl standing behind me puking in your hair, instead of mine.   I think that about covers it all. Man, I was a mean kid. Seriously, these are the things that I did that I am sorry about, there is so much that I'm not remorseful over. But that was then and this is now, right?  Okay - time for a more happier mood...  Matt sent me this article that most of you have probably read from my AOL away message, but if not,  urlLink here you go . My only question is, HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?????  Not a whole lot else going on, just killing time working from home. As you can see, I've been most productive today.

      When I was six, I had a slight run-in with the law.  My parents, as I may have mentioned before, were ministers with the Salvation Army. Often, because of this, my weekends were devoured by their careers - going to SA events, preparing for church the next day, etc. This particular Saturday was no different.  We were at a small Christian Book Store in Paramus, New Jersey. They had these pencils with Jesus' head as the eraser and I just  had  to have one. I asked my mom and was denied. So I tiptoed around the perimeter of the store to where my dad was. Flashing him my best puppy-dog face, I was denied again.  So I took matters into my own hands.  Looking around, I crammed the Jesus-head pencil into my coat pocket. Then, in a brief moment of generosity, I picked up an Abraham-head pencil and did the same. For my brother.  We left the store and went across the street to Burger King - our reward for being good while our parents shopped. After we ordered, my brother and I went to get a table while our parents waited for the food.  It was then that I unveiled my prized Jesus-head pencil.  "Mom said you couldn't have that." My brothers jealous eyes glared from across the table. "Relax," I told him, "I got you one too." As I produced his Abraham-head pencil, I felt the pride bubble up inside of me: I had done something nice for my brother.  Well, apparently he had something against Abraham, because quicker than I had shoved it into my pocket just minutes earlier, he already had run to the line and come back with my mother.  To make a long story short, I got a lecture on stealing and was brought back to the Christian Book Store. I had to apologize and promise not to do it ever again. And I didn't.  Until the next time we went in.  This time it was a pack of "Disciple Cards" that caught my eye. Well, it was the same story. Both parents said no, so I pocketed it. Afterwards, we went to the  same  Burger King and after my brother and I ordered, we went and found a table.  Looking back, I should have held out until we get home, but I couldn't. The excitement was too overwhelming. I took out the cards and began reading them. I think all of New Jersey heard my brother announce, this time without actually leaving the table, that I had stolen  again .  Like the last time, my parents took me back and made me apologize to the old woman who worked there. Once again, I had to beg her not to call the police. I was forgiven, although my parents were asked not to bring me back, as I was now a repeat offender.  So there is a small Christian Book Store in Paramus, New Jersey that I am not allowed in. I'm not exactly sure what would happen (or even if this store is still there) if I went in, but I am pretty sure it would go something like this:  I would walk into the store and the door would shut behind me, echoing for dramatic effect. As the door slams shut, all the lights in the store would dim and turn a reddish hue. A deep voice, without a definite location would bellow, "I knew you'd be back. Just as I knew about Eve and the apple." And then the building would starts shaking. There would be cracking and popping noises as pieces of drywall fell into my hair, and I would have a sinking sensation. At that point, I would pass out. When I awakened, I would learn that the earth had opened up and swallowed the building (and me) whole and that I was never going to get out. I would spend eternity stuck beneath the plates of the earth. All alone. With no Jesus and Abraham-head pencils, and surely no disciple cards to keep me company.  That said, I'm not going to risk it.

      As I sit here, bored out of my mind, and pretending to be working, I see that I am the only one on my buddy list who is not idle. Few of you lazy imps had the motivation to put up an away message, and the other two of you haven't given me much to go on with the away message you did leave me, so I shall determine what it is that you are actually doing:   Keith - Busy saving the world from overgrown ants and crickets, using only pennies which he has to climb atop buildings and drop in hopes of squashing them one by one. It may be awhile, so leave a message if you would like, but don't expect a prompt reply.  Tiffany - Throwing rocks at boys and missing me.  Brian - Not at his computer right now, but nerding it up all the same. :)  Ben - See Brian.  Liz - Carefully avoiding work at the bank. Perhaps hiding under her desk, eating Twizlers, hoping to disguise her growling stomach so it doesn't give her away.  Elizabeth - Attempting to run away from the day campers. A valiant effort, but they will overcome her all the same.   Well, I've wasted some company time and I think I may even be more bored than I was a few minutes ago. Such is life...  One more day of work this week...

      So I've made some changes to the site. I think you will like them. If not, then stop coming because I'm not gonna change it back just for you.  I'm pressed for time, so lemme leave you with some observations:   With each passing day, I can't wait for graduation. I can't wait to have a job that I am somewhat interested in.  The wedding is a week from Saturday and we have a ton of stuff to do and no money to do it with.  ALF Season I is out on DVD now.  Want to make me happy? Well, hang on a little bit more and I will make it easier than ever for you. Keep watching.   Time for some old-fashioned TV.  Sleep well y'all.
