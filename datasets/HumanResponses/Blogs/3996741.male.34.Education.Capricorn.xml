       Nowadays   is an adverb that means "at the present time" or "these days." It is used primarily to show contrast between a period, state or situation in the present that is different from the past. Most often it follows the use of   used to   and the conjunction    but.       For example:      People used to dress up to go to the theater, but nowadays no one hardly does.    He used to come to work early every day, but nowadays he is always late.      This is not to be confused with the use of   now.      For instance:      My favorite food used to be Italian, but now it is Japanese.    Last year I wanted to be a doctor, but now I want to be lawyer.      In conclusion, nowadays   nowadays   is not used very often, so you are better off not using it all the time.

       When I was a kid, I used to come home from school feeling very tired and uncommunicative. My mom would try to have a conversation with me and it would go something like this:       -How are you?    -I'm fine.    -How was school?    -Fine.       And the conversation would stop there.  Although the word   fine   is a perfectly good description of how one feels, it really doesn't express a lot of information. Try to get into the habit of automatically telling someone   how you really feel   or just talk about what is going on. Look at the following:       -How is it going?    -Not bad. How 'bout yourself?    -It's okay. Work is going kind of slow.     -Do you wanna have lunch later?    -Ok. I'll call you.        OR       -    How you're doing?  -Oh, not too well. I just got into a big fight with my boss.  -Why? What happened?  -Oh, it's a long story...I'll tell you later. What's up with you?  -Not much. I'm just trying to figure out where I want to go for vacation next month.  -Cool.     To conclude, Americans are actually a very friendly bunch. You just need to learn how to access communication with a few simple cues.

      There are some words in English that have similar counterparts in Portuguese; however, they have different meanings.  Take the verb  to intend.  It means to plan or have in mind an objective or goal.   I intend on making lots of money when I graduate from medical school.    There is also the verb  to pretend.  It means to simulate, or make believe.  The children were pretending to be cowboys and indians.

        When I get up in the morning, I have trouble seeing. Why? Because I   wear   contact lenses. So, I have to put them in before I can do anything. In Portuguese, we use the verb   usar,   but in English we use the verb   to wear   when we put any type of accessory or clothes on our bodies.      Look:    Do you wear glasses?    Some people wear black socks with gym shoes.    What are you wearing tonight?    Who wore my shirt yesterday?    Jersey girls wear big earings.    Have a great week...just don't wear me down!

       We use the preposition   towards   to show the direction in which the subject is going. This is different than   to,   in which the direction is not so important as to the place that the subject is going.     For example:   I'm going   to   the newstand to buy a magazine.   (what is important is the destination: newstand)    I was walking   towards   the supermarket when I bumped into an old friend.   (what is important is the direction: on the way to the supermarket)    Observe:   In her near-death experience, she recalls heading   towards   the light.     (of course, the destination Heaven is important, but if she didn't really die, then she never made it   !)             View of the Christ in Flamengo.

       Sometimes, the same word in Portuguese will have 2 or more different words in English. For example, take the word   sombra.   This can mean either   shadow   or   shade.    However, both have very different meanings.    Shadow   refers to the specific outline that a person, object, or thing creates when in front of the sun or other bright light source.     The children were playing, jumping on each other's shadows.   Jamie followed his mother around all day like a shadow.   The sun shone through the leaves, casting shadows on the lawn.     On the other hand,   shade   refers to a    slight darkness caused by something blocking the direct light from the sun, usually an undefinable area.    We didn't want to sit in the sun, so we asked for a table in the shade.     The children played   under the   shade   of    a lar ge beach umbrella.     Shades   can also mean   sunglasses.   A  shady   person is someone who is dishonest or does illegal things.
