      Vv, Jean and myself left for lunch together. And soon, we  engaged in an age-old issue that I believe plagues every office worker in the world, "Where are we going for lunch?" There are the foodcourts, fast food joints, coffeshops, restaurants.. Haiz..   By general consensus (Which translates to voting), we  decided on the "zai-peng" (mixed vegetable) store tucked in a little corner of the interchange. Yea I know Vv, not "zai-peng" again.. But hey, (In event shes reading this) not only is it economical but its also tons healthier then  your mee k! Anyway, its at this little store hidden from the general public that I witness an incredible trait about men that has largely remained uncharged for centuries or  even since our ancestors first roamed this land.  Across the road was these 2 fellas on a motorbike; A rider and a pillon. The bike stopped at a red light and a young  lady in her early 20s started crossing the road. Right away, a signal went off in the heads of the fellas as their in-built radar picked her up. Eyes zoomed in the general direction, They stared, from the moment she started crossing all the  way till she reached the side and still they kept their sights  locked on her as their heads turned to an uncomfortable and near impossible angle of at least 100 degrees to the left.  A grin/ smirk broke out on my face. Man...       www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Collegue alerted me to this young, pretty temp. staff  at work today. Not the sweety pie, disgusting sort. This ones tan, tall and doesnt play the whole " sweety -pie-doe-eyed-thinggy". Fantastic. Ran into her at the  pantry and decided to say hi. She smiled and quickly  walked away. So sad. But deep down i know, the  important thing is that,   "I already gave my best. I have no regrets at all." "Afterall, i have no professional training with girls." ~ William Hung/ American Idol  But she did smile at me...  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      What is the fascination with it? I have asked myself a  number of times. But I could never quite reach a  satisfactory conclusion. One possible explanation is  the marvelous abilityto manipulate smoke. The  incredible hours one has put in to master the know -how of blowing smoke rings. The amount of de- votion one spends on a toilet bowl with a ciggie in  hand attempting to achieve the unachievable is most  admirable and stupid.  Is it the sight of one exhaling smoke through our  mouths or nostrils that continue to captivate us?  Have you seen a still or black and white picture of  a person smoking? Awesome isnt it? As a Chinese,  (often quoted as the descendents of the dragon)  is this an attempt to connect with our roots~ a  fire-breathing dragon? Then again, Chinese dragons  unlike their European medieval counterparts do not  breathe fire.   So what exactly is the reason? I will get back to you  if I ever have the answer.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      How does one know when you have reached the comfort zone  with another fellow human being? Intimacy? Sex? I say food.  When you are able to just "pig" out with each other knowing  you will not be judged or seen unfavourably by the other party.  When you are able to burp as many times as you want, order  as much food as you can or cannot eat. That is when you know.  For people in Singapore, may I recommend you the All-u-can- eat-Jap-a-la-carte buffet at the Miramar. It serves fresh and  very sweet Tako, my favourite! My opinion, damn worth it at  $30++ but you can only get a seat provided you call in advance.  Last nite, We just ate like pigs!!  Btw, 10+ hrs later.. I still feel like a pig  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Just finished jogging. Im a self-confessed lazy bum. If  given a choice, I'll rather spend the day not excercising. But the irony is.. I love jogging. Rather, I love the after -effect that comes after huffing and puffing for 20+  mins. I cant quite describe it but it seems to just shake  the codwebs off and its gives a very refreshing feel. +  I did to whip my disgusting, smoke-filled lungs into  shape. And here I am keying in my entry and having a  puff. Sheesh.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Seems like a pretty good day today. Munched on a tomato for  B-fast; cos the signs of aging is starting to show. Dark  overcast skies over me as I strolled to work. No idea why but  such weather always make me feel more alive and ups my  energy level. A tropical lighting storm actually gives me a high,  quite unlike any other. Maybe I was a follower of Thor, the god  of lightning in my previous life. I felt good and looking good in  my new $270 pair of shoes, cladded in a neatly pressed deep  blue shirt and dark trousers. With a bag in my right hand and  cigarette in my left, I was ready to take on the world!  That was until I reached my office. The fella sitting behind me,  about 3m away was wearing blue (top) and black (bottom).  About 7m away was another fella (manager) also wearing the  same combination. That just kindda ruined my morning.

      I always thought that life was kindda like a road. As you go  down it, you get to know yourself better, discover yourself  a little more with each step that you take. Now, im not so  sure.   How can a person live for 27 years and not know much about  oneself? Someone more than a fren commented, You ought to know who you are, what you are and your likes and dislikes  after living 27 years. You are just denying it. That really got me thinking..  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Time: Abt 2350hrs Venue: Siglap, near a ktv  A lady in a 30s came up to me asking for a light. I scanned her from head to toe and promptly lighted up her cigarette. She aint exactly pretty but still am in pretty good shape + she looked rather sexy in her long flowing black dress. I was thinking to myself~ Well done pal, you still have what it takes! Guess shes got to be from the ktv, out here for a break. She sat down next, a short distance away and started to make small talk. What transpired next, really left me baffled and disgusted.  2 fellas came out from the ktv and started making what I assumed to be sleazy remarks directed at the girl. One lighted up his cigarette and they both stopped about 10m in front of her. I just minded my own business.. then I heard the sound of water.. I turned towards the direction and I could see water spattering on the ground in front of the men.. Curious as to where all that water is coming from, I lifted my line of sight to see this small little piece of meat sticking out of his trousers. The man was laughing together with his friend while pointing his "pathetic-piece of dick-meat" at the ktv girl and pee-ing. Man!

      Flashback to the year.. hmm let me see  1977 + 13 = 1990 okay, flashback to the year 1990. I was 13 years of age then, sec.1 attending St Hilda's Secondary school. It was a good year, I  was never quite comfortable nor chatty in primary  school. Let me explain why was it a good year. St Hilda's Sec was previously located in Katong and it was once an all-girls school. After it relocated itself in Tampines, it started taking in guys. I so happen to be one of the guys *duh and only the second  batch taken in so the gender ratio is like so in my favour *heehee   Anyhow, as with all freshmen.. theres always like  all the ECA groups trying hard to 'recruit' you. So what happens is the different ECA groups would go around all the classes to 'recruit' us. So one  day, a bunch of the sweetest, cutest girls I ever laid my eyes on walked into my classroom and  captured the eyes, attention, hearts and minds  and what else have you.. of all the fellas in class.  They were from the St Johns Ambulance Brigade.  What happened next was chaotic, guys were  charging to the front to join the SJAB. Result; 3/4 of the class guys were eventually with the St Johns. Guess it helps that the uniform then was exactly what the nurses wear in those jap porn  flicks. The nurse uniform, complete with the zip  down the middle as well as that nurse-headgear. & that was how I too became a member of that organisation. Needless to say, the recruitment  drive was a sucess!  Back then, in class was this girl (Lets call her P) who too joined the St Johns. Her pa owned the chain of Seoul Gardens restaurant then so  almost every Saturday we went there for makan or just relax over at her place in Telok Kurau  where her maid would prepare pasta for us. Life was good then. Not a care in the world, girls  were young and innocent, boys being boys just couldnt keep our hands to ourselves. We could just run around, play and perspire. (Today, you try and play hide and seek with your collegues la see what happens.. the security guard in the  building you work in would probably ring up  Woodbridge)   I recall.. her folks have this pair of samurai  swords on this cabinet and we just love to play with them and that usually translates to us guys chasing each other, clanking our swords and virtually fighting it out like in medival times. Way Cool!! until one day, when her mum came up to  me and she said.. Are you the one whos been  playing with our swords? Do you know how much they cost? Take a look at the hilt and you'll notice a part of it has been chipped off.. and I was there welding the sword in my right hand.. Opps.. Haha  I missed those days and the companionship of  those fellas. Anyhow.. Miss P called me up last night and shes coming back for a couple of weeks in July! Yippee cos shes been away in NZ since  1996.. I think.. and we were such close friends  then.. & this is probably only the 3rd time shes  back since that year. I know we have pretty much lived our own lives in different corners of the world for years but that didnt seem to be a factor when we talked last night. As the seconds past as we  talked last night, the years just seemed to roll back. Welcome to Singapore pal.. even thou its only for 3 weeks.   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      By the way, has anyone heard this one before? Is  the creature depicted on the logo of the Tiger beer a male or female? Give it some thought k.. This  riddle was like so popular years ago. Ans: Its a  male. If its a female, then the advert's slogan would be "hey, give that man a TIGERESS".  I know, im pathetic and bored. HAHAAHA    www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Picked this up from some fella's blog. Thought it was plain hilarious.. in a slapstick kindda way..  Since thursday I have been excreting out blood  alongside my faeces. Its terrible to see blood  dripping outta ya ass because   1)Colon cancer is the IN thing right now in the     cancer world. 2)People like Murugan tell you stuff like how your    ass has lost its "virginity"  So I decided to see a doctor today to check out  what the heck was wrong with my ass (and at the same time, make full use of my long weekend).  All I can say is that the whole experience was pretty traumatic.I mean after telling him my problem, He  gave me a smile (YES A SMILE! WTF MAN! if I HAD  To peer into someone's ass at 8.30am in the morning theres no way Im gonna SMILE at you) before asking  me to lie sideways on the funny bed thingy they have at clinics. He then proceeded to then put on this white rubber glove. It sorta fitted in with that snap sound  you hear in the movies. It got pretty weird cos of the  things the doctor said like "Ok open wide .. now dont move..this may hurt abit."  He wasnt kidding.  If you (yes you the reader) ever wanted to shove  something up my ass. Well congrats! You finally got  your revenge. It was quick but painful. I cant really  explain the feeling, it was like you suddenly feel  something stuck up "there". That something then  proceeds to move around like some hamster lost  in some hole.Your brain then starts ringing the  alarm bells screaming out the words "OUCH!!!"  To make matters worse.. The doctor had applied  some kind of cream around my anus and it sorta felt as if he had just shoved his whole dick in  there and then ejaculated. Yes folks, figuratively speaking... I got ass fucked.  The next few momments were blury.. All I  remember was him passing me the M/C before he ushered me to the door. Polyclinics suck big  time. Its friggin confusing I had no idea where to  go and what to do since it was my first time there in a very long time (and most possibly my last)  I sorta feel like some cheat slut, getting fingered in the ass just to get my one day mc.

      Its been said that good music never dies.. guess thats true so long as old geezers like myself are still around :)  Been kindda 'inspired' to write my own story after reading someone else's on his blog. Born in the year 1977 year of the snake, like many of my peers I spent the best time of my life~ Teenage years listening to GnR. * As I type, lyrics to civil war just keeps bouncing in my head. Visions of Axl Rose  jumping around.. Wonder if he actually had  his hair rebounded.. cos they are so damn straight! That was Secondary 2.  Around that time, I also happened to pick up the guitar with my good chum in church.  Stephen, my good man was the fella who  introduced me to the good stuff. The 'Gods' of rock.. The Doors, Deep Purple, CCR, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton.. These guys are like either old farts or long dead when I started listening to their cassettes *In case in didnt know what they are.. Man you are really young or am I really old. Ha. Bands of those days are really good with their guitars. Their guitar solo can stretch like 10 minutes.. I had always envisioned myself as a lead guitarist. They were my inspiration to pick up the guitar.  I soon became one of those goons who started  keeping shoulder-length hair, wearing black tees and most unforgiveable of all.. moving and tap- ping my feet to loud music on my headphones  while on public transport. OMG*Swear it made  sense then and it was so cool.. haha As I looked  back.. I couldnt believe it.. But I cant say I  regretted it either.. hell..   In the 90s, grunge arrived on the scene. While I  do have a soft spot for 'smells like teen spirit'. It never quite had the same impact/ hold on me. It just didnt seem pure. Some even say Rock is starting to die as grunge ushers in the new millenium. Ha.. How untrue.. we see the recent hype on Gnr didnt we.. Mtv was like playing them  every hour.   In the 90s, after much struggle.. I started to  embrace the new age.. Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumkins.. Hell I even attended both their concerts in Singapore!! Yeaaah.. It sure rocks.  And then now, in the new millenium.. Just last night, I was singing softly to the 'All around the  watchtower' Jimmi Hendrix.. Guess its come full circle. Perhaps Im just too old to take in anymore new stuff. Guess so long as we live, so do Rock. ROCK ON!!  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      With a hotdog in my right hand, coke light in another, I   proceeded alone into the movie theatre on a Saturday night.  Its been.. Gee I cant recall the last time I actually watched a movie all by myself. In fact.. Have I ever? *ponders ponders Alright wait before anyone screams LOSER!! I was there  to wait for my beautiful half to knock off from work k!  Its actually kindda strange initially going to the movies all by myself but I soon got myself comfortable. Perhaps the yummy hotdog helped. Anyhow, the movie started really strong and scary and I was mentally giving myself a good pat on my shoulders congratulating myself on deciding to catch this. Story goes like this.. Somehow, the movie never explained why.. but dead people are biting the living and its turning them into the undead. And soon the undead outnumbers the living and they sought refuge in a shopping mall.   Thats when some humour comes into the movie. From what I read somewhere. This was suppose to be re-make of an earlier classic. As the movie progressed on, more humour got injected into the movie and it starts to lose its scariness. Also, the snips the censorship board did were really starting  to upset me big time. Inside source reveals that there  were at least 16 snips in the entire movie. Man! I dont get  it.. You know sometimes we pay good $ to go to to movies just so we can scare ourselves.. I know that didnt quite make  sense but yea.. thats what we do.. Dont believe me, ask all fellas.. why do they bring their dates to horror flicks. AHH.. Im sure you guys agree. Anyhow the movie was turning into a major letdown.   On the banners on its promotional movie posters reads  'Watch the TERRIFYING first 10 mins at www.xxx.com.sg'. If you ask me.. I totally agree. Save your money folks. This film has got B-Grade stamped all over it.    www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      08:40 hrs Approx These days, the weathers turning real humid. Its around  this time of the year that I really wish I aint a Singaporean. Why cant I be born in a country with a cooler climate? Due to my schedule for the rest of the day, I decided to put on a singlet under my business shirt before heading to work.  Hate it when I perspire and the bloddy shirt starts clinging  to my back. Hate it when I have the water-splashed-on-me -look when I eventually get to the office. *ended up looking pretty much like an uncle, I think.. guess u can call me  Uncle Tan.  10:00 Approx.  Went for a puff with the guys and discovered all 3 of us  are wearing blue! Sheesh hate it when that happens.   12:15 Left my office for the head office.  14:00 Met the HR manager. I was invited to share my experience working at my current place at a recruitment talk. This  was my second time, guess the 1st time round, the  management must have figured that my acting skills were  pretty good and decided to use me again. I sat there with the HR exec.s while the manager gave the applicants an  introduction to the scheme. Man, I almost fell asleep. This  manager has got to have the most boring voice I have  ever come across. Monotonous, without any pitch at all... It was like Yada yada..da..yada.. makes chanting sounds  like fun. Then it was my turn to take over the stage. &  the liar in me promptly took over.. At this point in time, I wish to apologise to all the applicants that if you had joined us cos you were swayed by my account of life in this organisation, I can only... say sorry. But what said were all true, I didnt lie.. Its just that I kindda played  with the words and painted a rosier picture.. thats all.. what was I to do.. I couldnt have said.. XXX is a stupid place, dont even consider joining us right? Hope you  guys can understand. Hey, forgive and forget okay.   15:30 Met up with Mr R for a smoke, ran into Miss E, Miss F and Miss A. Hmm..never knew Miss A could look as  yummy as she did today.. Tainted lenses, dark  rebonded hair, dresses in a pair of causal sandals  and what looks like a sarong.. she looks like she just  came back from Bali or something. :P  16:00 Attended a meeting with about 10 other executives from various departments. You see, the orgainisa- tion I work for is working towards obtaining a  benchmark, standard or certificate.. something along  the lines of ISO9001. And this meeting is held  specifically for us so that in a few days time when  the independent assesors/ auditors come down to  assess the organisation and interview us.. we would  know exactly what to say and what not to. Isnt  that incredible? Firstly, this certification that the  organisation is trying to acheive aint some dumb mickey mouse stuff. Its suppose to be widely  respected and they are like telling us.. O dont  tell them that we dont practice this thinggy  here la.. try to be smart and smoke them a little.. I was like.. I couldnt believe my ears. Plus they  even know that the 10 of us would be the  selected ones chosen on the day for the  interview when it should have be a situation  of random picking. Ha.. What a joke! Its like the bookies at work.. before the match gets  underway, they already know what the eventual scoreline would be.. match-fixing.  But I guess thats always been the case with  everything in life huh. As a particularly famous  playwright by the name of William once said..  "All the life's a stage.. and we all but actors"  or something like that. By the way, it aint  William Hung.. You nitwit! Life's but just a big wayang.. we are all pretending and acting.. You can dowhatever you want but just dont get  caught...  18:15 Approx. Borders, meeting up with gf later for Japanese. Meantime, reading a book titled 1401.. Most  fascinating.. Talks about Emperor Zhu Di and  the eunich Zheng He and the might of China in the 15th century... How incredibly advanced  China was.. then.. compared to the rest of the  world. For instance when the King of England,  I think it was Henry V.. got married, there were 600 guests. But when the Emperor of China  greeted his foreign guests, there were a tens of thousands of dignitaries at his court who sat  thru a 10 course meal! When the imperial  chinese fleet set sail, it was the world's largest  armada ever. Had the navies of the known world come together, the Chinese fleet would have  just swept them aside. Wow! I was like totally  blown away. I mean, I knew all this while China  was really advanced at one point in time before Europe's renassaince age.. I just didnt know  they were that advanced. Another example, the Chinese fleet were armed with guns, cannons,  incedinary weapons while European fleets were still armed with bows and arrows. For a history  buff like me, it was a most interesting read!  19:15 Approx Dinner  21:30 Movies, 50 first kisses. Go and watch the movie!  I sincerly advise anyone whos reading this to go. I laughed so hard I almost threw my lungs out.  *sleepy and kindda horny.. think will go sleep liao. Nite all and sleep tite. To my 2 of my friends over in Australia, hey gd luck with ya papers. :)   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      On saturday night..  X-Nation show at Zouk was a mini version of 'Fashion  Rocks', where local Xtreme sports enthusiasts get a  chance to showcase their talents (or rather..the lack of  it.. pui pui) I winced as I watch them perform.. Man..  the 'talents' were generally makin a fool of themselves.. Someone please hand these lamers a trophy quick and  and move on with the show.. Please indicate on the  trophy.. for effort at mimickng.. but failing miserably. POSERS!! Ha!   Thank the good man above us for the show coming  up next.. The models parading through the parking lots. All that flesh on parade, the hot young bodies in skim- mpy attire. Yum yum, yummy.. and then how the camera -men all crowed around this model whom in my opinion  might as well not wear anything still tickles me. :)  Then we went down to Geylang for bean-curd but ended up at a kopi-tiam instead.. Dunno why.. Just ended up  there. And after that where did we go? yap.. haha its more flesh, short skirt, legs, tay-tays.. haha what do  you expect.. we are after all at the flesh trade fair! :P Man.. its been a feast for my eyes all nite long.     www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Qing Ming: A day set aside for remembrance of the dearly  departed. Often families would turn up at their graves to  clean and offer their prayers. Source: Ah Tan's dictionary edition 2004  I like cementaries. Theres something about the clear skies  overhead, the tranquility, the silence that I find most  endearing. I paid a visit to quite a few guys today. There  was my grandpa who passed away months before I was  borned (Fortunately my dad's family aint supertitious and at the same time, unfortunately cos I never got to witness his infamous temper. I heard he uses to hammer my  uncles and pa with a hammer) My grandma who passed away at my old place a broken, dejected and unwanted old lady. (My dad was third in line and my eldest uncle was the one my grandma doted on and left all her houses and  property) My cousin who commited suicide at the age of 21 (Thanks to that uncle again). A friend of my folks who died due to kidney failure (Guess NKF came on too late).  I always like visiting them. Guess it reminds us of our  mortality and that death awaits us all in the not too distant future.  When I die, would anyone still remember me... Come to think of it, I probably dont mind if nobody does.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      There are very few or limited things in life that just goes on and on. Or should I say there are few things in life thats  more certain (esp. if you are residing in Singapore) than the ever-need to obtain certificates, qualifications, licenses,  passes, tickets etc. You start off with a PSLE cert. then the O-levels. Depending on where you go, either an A-levels or a diploma. An ORD cert. Followed perhaps by a degree.. You starting to see the picture.. Along the way, perhaps a driving license, ROM cert.. Even the old are not spared, to  qualify for concessions while using the public transport you need a concession pass~ An orange-coloured card with a  little picture of you printed on the top right corner. And  even when you are lying in your coffin all smartly dressed  and dolled-up. You still need a death certificate for your funeral to take place.  Its just incredible how after living for more then a quarter of a century it still amazes me and makes wanna laugh/ cry, I  cant decide. Wats even more incredible is. I have accepted it  and have been insitutionalised and therefore, gone over to  the 'Dark side' :) I wish I could just be a professional  bummer, a beach dude or something.. waitering or doing  temp. jobs etc.   But no.. I too have jumped onto the bandwagon.. M5 la,  riding license, paper chase, cash in bank.. What to do..  society never judge a person for what they are but what  they have.. therefore, even though I may be a few years  behind.. Im determined to catch up.   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      What is it about relationships. The need to feel  needed, cherished and loved that makes us all  behave in a manner that just cannot be  comprehended? Are we all insecure by nature?  so much so that when the person that we  perceive as our love appears we would do all  that we can to keep her/ him by ourside. Even if it means things that are quite unexpected of  that otherwise usually sensible person. She/ He becomes demure and really nice. Hmm.. And  then towards another, the same person per- forms a complete transformation into a bitch/  bastard. Amazing yea..   There are some who are completely blinded by LOVE; Gf refuses to hold hand of Bf in public  and yet professes to marry him one day. Yet,  he trusts her completely. Others who got  dumped by their partner the moment he realises shes pregnant and then confesses that hes  been seeing this other girl for for the entire  duration of their relation-ship and reveals that  shes in fact been the third party instead. And  still she says the fault does not lie with him.  Myself, I was once in a relationship. Once, my  then-Gf spent an incredible night at my place.  A week later, she dumped me despite telling  me repeatedly how incredible that night was  and blah blah... blah. It hurt so much that I  could have taken my own life. Relationships are such a pest! But the best part.. we keep  coming back for more like moth drawn towards the fire. We keep believing despite getting  burned.. perhaps cos we wanna believe.   Men are such liars,  we lie to others and even to ourselves.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      I knew I should have gone for supper with the rest  of them. I started to hunt for any scrap or morsel  of food I could lay my hands on.   Having fed the pig, the pig (He) sat down in front  of my computer. There is a mirror hanging on the  wall in front of him. He looked up. Staring from  the mirrorwas a wrinkled face with huge black,  Ikea-like shopping bags under the eyes.  Repulsed, he recoiled in horror. Then he heard a  male voice calling out to him from the mirror. It  had a familiar tone to it that he just couldnt  quite register. As his courage returns, he coura- geously looked into the mirror and once again the  image stared back at him and this time around he  heard " Siao-eh, wat time already? Still dont sleep?  Sleep very important you know.. Still go drinking  and clubbing.. You think you 18 or 19 year old isit?  Lao liao la you, still dont take care of yourself later  look like Ah-pek then you know."  OKOK, after this I go sleep.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      When I asked you to listen to me, and you start giving advice, you have not done what i asked.   When i asked you to listen  and you begin to tell me why i shouldn't feel that way, you are trampling on my feelings   When i asked you to listen to me and you feel you have to do something to solve my problems you have failed me, strange as that may seem.   Listen!! All i asked you was that you listen, not talk or do. Just hear me.   Advice is cheap. $0.48 is all I need to get a cigarette to kill myself.  And I can do for myself. I'm not helpless. Maybe discouraged and faltering, but not  helpless.   When you do something for me that i can and need to do for myself,  you are not helping me. You are contributing to my fear and inadequency.   But when you accept as a simple fact that i do feel what i feel, no matter how irrational, then i can quit trying to convince you and can get about the business of understanding whats behind this irrational  feeling.   And when thats clear the answer are obvious and i don't need advice.   Irrational feelings make sense when we understands whats behind them.   Perhaps thats why prayer's works sometimes for some people because GOD is mute and HE/SHE doesn't give advice or try to fix things.   So please listen and just hear me. And if you want to talk, wait a minute for your turn and I'll listen to you.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Was a little apprehensive when my collegue, X  asked if i wanna join him and this previous  collegue of ours, C for a night out. Reason  being: 1) im trying to save up for a holiday. 2) i dont know her friends and how the night would turn out to be.. it would really be shitty you know.. cooped up in a smokey and noisy confine and the people there aint the least friendly. Then i could have been better off sleeping.  Anyhow, after much consideration i thought  what the heck.. you know, havent been out  socialising for quite awhile now and its time i put my rusty 'charms':) to the test. I  decided to meet up with X after all before  proceeding down.  It turned out to be a birthday celebration for  C and the girls, a total of 5 of them had  already taken up 2 tables and opened a bottle of JD. And the best part.. Not a guy in sight, they didnt have any male friends with them.. Hee, i was pratically rubbing my hands in glee! haha kidding again.   Turned out to be a pretty good night out. I  was initially worrried.. you know when you meet a bunch of people you have never met in your entire life, especially in a setting such as a night spot. How would they respond to you?  Hostile? cold? Unfriendly? Would i come across as a lecherous A-Beng or something? Haha  Scenarios like.. cracking some jokes that you thought was hilarious but everyone else thought it was dumb quickly came to mind. After all,  gotto understand.. im happily attached and i  havent try to make small talk with another girl in a pub setting in perhaps a year odd! Gee,  whats becoming of you.. haaha  Anyhow it really was no problem, the girls were all 25 except for Cin whos 28 and has got 3 daughters.. trust me, she didnt look like one.  In fact, i was kindda like checking her out.  Theres A whos 25 and has a 6 year old daughter! whoa girls are really getting married young huh. Booze was flowing, we were all puffing away and laughing, dancing. It was a good night. Even  though 4 of C's guy friends turned out later on, X and myself were still having quite a bit of fun. Must be the booze la!   You know this recent relaxation of bartop  dancing thinggy. Cin and i was like stoning from all the booze and we were just kindda propped up against the wall and on the bartop was like fella 'attempting' to dance. His friends were like  cheering him on. Haiz, no doubt courageous and  no im not trying to be mean.. i can totally  accept an ordinary fella who might not be much of dancer but is up there purely to enjoy himself but not when he / she thinks they are the hottest  creature that god has ever created to hit the  dance floor! He was disgusting the way he moves  and hoards the bartop.   *yucks Maybe the parliament or goverment or stat.  board or anyone should come up with a ruling that forbides these 'performers' from being up there  for longer then a period of 10 minutes. Repeat offenders shall be flogged in public and  imprisoned for not lesser then a 7 days or both.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      A few nights ago..  Gotto confess, I entered the cinema constantly thinking.. O dear, the gf's gonna be like so  damn bored. All that fighting, blood, gore  and history.. I couldnt be more wrong. Just  read on..  Instead of using their screen names, lets  just stick to their names that we know them  by huh. Ok. Good, cos I sure as hell couldnt  spell them..   Movie goes like this.. Young horny fella,  Orlando falls for beautiful Helen and sleeps  with her. Iregardless of fact that shes  someone else's wife, he runs home with her,  couldnt be bothered less that it could well  stir up a war that his family could not hope  to win. As a result, all of Greece went to  war.. thus the phrase; The face that launches  a thousand ships.   If you ask me.. Helen looks pretty ordinary  at the start of the show but somehow.. once  she arrives at Troy, she looks awesome,  almost like she had a makeover or something. Must be the air in Troy being fresher or  something.. hee.  & *drum rolls.. 2 nations goes to war over a girl. Now you may say ah.. u bloody unromantic! Cos you probably detected by now that I so  cant stand that Orlando fella cos I think he  just looks like a freaking wussy! Now thats  absoultely true! bt also because of the fact  that his actions caused the start of a war  that left tens of thousands dead, Troy burnt to the ground, the death of his brother and  father.  As much as I believe in giving for Love, such a hefty price to pay for a beautiful companion, Helen is way too high.  Back to my gf, my early worries were simply  unfounded. She was absolutley stuck to the  screen, now who can blame her.. all that  muscles, biceps, 6 packs, bronze skin.. Im  starting to think the movie should be  tittled; "Troy and the half-naked men who  fights for it". Wats all that skin for? I dont  get it. I guess sex sells.. ah.. *much enlightened now.  Anyhow, for all that hype.. the movie for me  was an absolute letdown. The plot was pathetic, the characters in the movie seems to have  brains the size of peas. For instance, why  would you wanna wheel in a disgusting black wooden horse for? esp. if its been in an  epidemic camp? Stupid. I hear someone argue; "Hey, its wheeled into the city of Troy as a wall trophy!" O yea, that only goes to prove my point. Normal people keep things like  sports medals or certificates as trophies. Or perhaps the Star search awards or an oscar or something.. a huge horse made from rotting wood? Those people are idiots :)  Its a darn waste of time and yes, you guessed it right. Im just a fat, outta shape,  disgusting male. Pretty much the opposite of an Alpha male. Maybe im just plain jealous huh.  2 outta 5 stars. Alrite maybe just 1 & 1/5  outta 5. For making me look like an obese.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com $15 each.

      Very simply put, there are 2 types of people in this world. The 'MAKE IT' and 'CANNOT MAKE IT'. Take note, its 'MAKE IT' and not 'MADE IT'. Im just a lowly office worker! I believe I belong to the former category of 'MAKE IT'. Cos I know  even if shit comes my way I'll just enter into my own shell and make my way thru it.   I may not be a hard-working fella and like all humans, I have days when I feel really down. But no matter what happens I believe Im strong enough to cope.   My other half gave me a call today. Right away,  I sensed somethings amissed. She sounded really awful, then she said~ Dear, Im very tired. By which she refers to her job. And I believe that extends to all aspects of her life.   Dear, I wish I could take you away from the  mundane and monotonous life im certain most  Singaporeans live thru. I wish I could take you away to a temperate country where you dont have to work on average 10 hours aday. Where we can actually get up from bed and not rush to work  but hand in hand we can go and smell the flowers, watch the birds and have a picnic somewhere. I  wish I could really pamper you like the princess that you are to me.  Dear, Im sorry.   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Been watching so many movies of late, somebody should pay me to do movie reviews. *Anyone whos in the industry* Im really affordable. I  may not do a good job at it but hey, Im cheap! say $2 a review. Hee.  This movie, Ella Enchanted hasnt hit the  screens yet but the well-connected dude that I am.. hee managed to watch it first. Perhaps  the first few thousands the world over.   I wont even pretend that this is gonna be a  movie review thinggy cos it isnt. This is all about Anne Hathaway. The movie is.. kindda  like Shrek except its not in a cartoon format. They have got real life actors. In the movie theres kings, princes, orges, elves, fairies and so on. In short, its a melting pot of  comedy, Love, teeny-poppy stuff, feel good  kindda movie set in a fantasy- medival times.  OKay, now.. Anne Hathaway. Shes everything a man would want in a woman. If every man can go out to the mall and buy themselves a  partner. I have a feeling everyones partner  would look just like her. Ok, maybe its just me. But seriously, what more can you ask for shes like gorgeous! Long curvy hair, great  body *alrite Im superficial but honestly, shes incredible-looking. Coming from a fella whos always thought Asians were far prettier and more exotic-looking and the 'Ang Mos'  all kindda look the same, this is a major compliment and indication shes HOT! She  almost looks like a young Liv Tyler, well at least in the movie anyway.   Outta 5 stars, this movie deserves a 4. If it had starred some other actress. Then im sorry, it would have gathered at max. a 3.  Did I forget to mention, we had a buffet  breakfast at the reception area before the  movie. And then.. Lunch at the Singapore  Recreational Club, tea at the Swissotel,  chocolates from Goldiva followed by more chocolates at the Esplanade, Dinner at the Thai Express and "Soon Kway" for supper.  Satistfaction Level: 10/ 10 Finace Level: Burnt! Weight: 70kg Feeling: Fat!  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Are you guilty of the following..  A phenomenon I have noticed for years..  My office is (Hallelujah) just a couple of blocks away from my residence. So quite obviously I stroll to work. But today, I had to attend a  meeting over at another location and as a  result I had to take the bus.   For all you fellas out like me.. who take buses.  Watch out for this occurance which I am  certain you too are guilty of or has suffered as a 'victim' before.   I was on bus service 23 this morning, minding  my own bussiness, reading my notes as the  bus trodded along our crowded roads. As the  bus drew into the bus bay outside Temasek  Polytechnic I couldnt help but look at all the  young girls busy getting up from their seats  to alight. Hee.. I know most guys are guilty  of this but that is not what this is all about.  Just in front of me was a lady in her mid-20s, executive looking, dressed neatly in her black attire.   Picture this.. A man just boarded the bus, he  "beeped" his ez-link card and stands scanning the bus for an appropriate seat. His gaze  "locks" on the empty seat beside the pretty executive in front of me and happily walked  over. He then performed a quick-well-executed turn and just "threw his entire buttocks" down beside her. The moment that big piece of lard  hits the chair, the poor lady just took off from  her seat. A second later, when she eventually  landed. Not a word was spoken as she dipped  her head and resumed her sleep while that block-head just opened his papers and started  reading. Everthing took place so fast and it  seems like theres absolutely nothing out of  place. Is this part and parcel of of the entire experience of taking a bus ride? Is this unquie only to our island republic? Hmm..   Now tell me, have you been guilty of that? Tell me also, have you been "bounced" off  your chair by some goon who thinks he/ she probably weighs only 1/10 of their body weight?  If you find this ridiculously funny and truely  stupid and can be avoided.. then lets keep in mind, the next time we 'park' our buttocks.. Do it gently, with grace and lightly. Theres  absolutely no need to anouce to the fella next  to you; "Hey, im here and im gonna sit next  to you! And I dont give a damn whether you  like it or not!" by sending that poor fella  airbone, abeit for only a split second."    www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      I have to declare that I have never watched any of Quertin Torantino movies before (That means no Reservoir dogs, no Pulp fiction, not even Kill Bill 1) What a shame.  I caught Kill Bill 2 last night. Man it sure as hell was cheesy, sexist, funny yet superbly brilliant. The show starts starts off in black and white.  Giving it a classic feel, sending one back to the  1930s Hollywood feel.. Ya abeit a little slow, and  I was starting to think whats all the big hoo-ha  about it, all that rave reviews and stuff. I was so wrong... As the show progresses, all the cues and stuff of a big cult movie was there. Some- times, it seems a little over the top even a little surreal.   Dont wanna give too much away but the fight  scene in the trailer was fantastic, the (act-cool) poses, the sword-fights, the eye ball.. hee. And how everyone laughed when you see the  'see-fu/ master' hahaha. Okay, got to rush off for lunch.. so end it really abrupt now.   2 words, "Go watch."  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      As asians, we are usually dark-haired. Quite often, it is black. Quite naturally so are our pubic hair. For short, lets address pubic hair as "Pubi".  Do you know/ Are you aware that blondes  generally do that have golden brown pubi?  Quite often they are a darker shade of brown.  Do you know/ Are you aware that its is usually the redheads who have red pubi? Aahh, bet  you'll never quite look at red-heads quite  the same ever again.  Good night now.

      Whats it with people?  Many of us loves to dance. Be it what people  call ballroom dancing, ballet, in-line, salsa  or whatever the hot dance moves we engage in at  Zouk or Centro. Of course, we all not created equal. Some of us move better then the rest.  Lets start with the girls. In my personal  opinion, the girls are born to dance. Their sensual body curves coupled with sleek movement never fails to drive a man's hormones into  overdrive. The way they sway their body, flick their hair.. Ggrrh, hot-stuff.   And us men, sad to say many us cant dance for peanuts. I recall an NS friend of mine who  dances like a boxer, constantly swinging his  arms.. pathetic. Dont even know if that can be considered as dancing. It doesnt matter if are an Ang Mo or Ci-A-Beng.. I repeat most men cant dance. The majority i come across in a clubbing scene are just well-dressed looking chaps who are failures are matching their gfs at dancing.  And somehow, what is considered as HOT and  probably cool would be a guy and a girl with either their pelvis or buttocks stuck close to each other and gyrating to the same beat like they were making out or something.. Dont you see that often? I do. Somehow, to be seen as  cool, fun and happening this always has to happen.  Was with F,C and L. 3 rather attractive girls last night. Myself and R, this collegue of  mine. We were just dancing and the 3 girls were really swaying away aggressively and before  long we were engaging in that too. It might  seem fun then, but on hindsight i just feel so damn dumb. Was it really sexy? ya, i suppose. But not when all 5 of us are attached and mind you, not to each other.  Sheesh, what was i thinking? haha, stupid us.   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      This AJ friend of ours just came back  from his term break from his law studies in (Shall only  mentionthat its somewhere in the vicinity of  Birmingham).  He brought back as a gift for us a mini little  bottle of de-odoriser more commonly known as  "popper" back in the UK. Now its not because we  have really bad feet or terrible odours, mind  you. You are suppose to raise the "popper" up  to your nose, press on one side of your nostril and deeply inhaled the fumes through your  remaining hole.   What does it do? One might ask.. Well, lets just  say his bf and him uses it to get a new high  while having sex. Whoa! I tried it and it sure  as hell feels pretty fine! Hee  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Had our usual pool outing earlier with the  usual culprits, D and M. After just a couple of games, M had to leave.   See M had this really odd relationship wi.  these 2 girls. Lets all them A and B. He started  out with A but after some time fell for B. So he broke up with A. Some months later, he got back together with A cos he missed her so bad.  Now, B is his workplace collegue and at this stage, she starts to reciprocate his advances. As a result, he broke up with A to be with B. That was just 3 months ago. Now, he feels B  aint the right girl for him and desperately  wants A back.   So after like 5 rounds of pool, he left to  meet up with A. Good luck pal.. you so ask for  it. *evil grin  So with nothing left to do (cos our game  requires at least 3 players) me and D left the pool parlor.  Thats when he updated me on his love story. See D is having a sexual relationship with this collegue of his who is due to ROM soon with their boss. Cool ah. I use to think he must have hated his own boss thats why he  made him a cuckoid.  Anyhow, he told me hes been dating this  other collegue recently. So i asked him if hes serious abt this new chick? and what abt his 'scandal'. His reply; " Dont worry la, no way will the scandal say anything  cos shes got too much at risk. " Cool ah.       www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Just got home. Had a good shower, still having a  bad headache. Its the first time for me, tonight to enter a gay bar. Well strictly speaking, its no longer one cos you get girls and lesbians  there too.. so you get a mixture. Its a joint located along Maxwell road near Duxton. That street is filled with nightspots and if you did not look carefully you would never have thought its a gay joint. Plus this one did not have the "flag".  Still its been pretty cool. Quite an experience. From the guys or should i call them mamas' hee. It use to be a strictly gay hang-out. But of  late, its acttracted all sorta fellas. But you see the cross-dressers, gays hugging and kissin. Lesbians doing the same stuff etc.   The "mamas'" are such a happening bunch. They  look like your regular men and dress like any other dick you see on the streets but once they start talkin. Man! they can be so darn bitchy. haha.. they are a fun lot to hang out with. The lewrd jokes, their "broken-wrist" syndromes etc.  Probably write a bit more next time round.  Headaches getting really bad.   www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com

      Gf called.. to buy a meal from Mcdonalds for her. So after work, not suspecting anything i returned home with a bag of Mcdonalds for dinner and boy was i in for a surpise.  She was in the shower so i went into the kitchen  to get myself a drink and thats when i heard jazz music. It took me a couple of seconds before  realising that it didnt come from within the house but it was from the garden. Curious i peered  outside and in the garden was a table decked out with food, wine in the ice-bucket and candles.  Apparently, the main course was steak and it was kindda burnt thats why she got me to buy dinner back.   I so didnt see this coming.. Thanks dear.  www.movieposters.mypicgallery.com
