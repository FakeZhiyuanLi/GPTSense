      It's Tuesday, June 29, 2004. I realized that I have exactly seven days to go before I go to Los Angeles to see what I have hyped myself to be the best show of the summer. I usually do not write anything so soon before any show, but then again, this isn't any show, or any band for that matter. This is Rush, my favorite band of all time, and they're celebrating the big 30. I am so excited, but before I could think about that, I have other things to occupy my mind with. First of all since I am going to LA en route to Manila and leaving for good, I still have a lot of packing to do. I'm not worried about it however. I also have many an errand to run before I could really have fun.   Today (June 29th) is also the nationwide release date of Rush's new CD "Feedback". "Feedback" contains song that have inspired each member of Rush to be who they have become. Rush rarely does any covers, so therefore a CD like this is quite rare indeed. I will pick it up later.  I also realize that this will be my very last week in New Hampshire. Although I know that I'll come back to visit, I realize that it will not be the same. When I first "got sick" of New Hampshire, I never thought I'd miss it like I imagine I will in a few weeks. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and my life in New Hampshire was a great thing. Now, the main theme of my last seven days in New Hampshire is to say goodbye to New Hampshire the right way. Good bye, New Hampshire. Hello Rush, hello LA, and subsequently, hello (again) home!

      Three nights removed from the extremely electric Van Halen show, and I was at it again. This time I was in Boston and it was my first concert as a former student. The night before, that I had completed my education and was extremely proud of it. Primus was in town and it was tapped to be a great show because of Les Claypool's mastery of the bass (something my friend, Big Masa and myself would really know how to appreciate). Our drummer friend Dave, from Vermont was with us, along with Chin (originally from Taiwan, but now Manchester, New Hampshire's very own).   As we entered the semi-outdoor venue (it was a giant tent, if I may call it that), I was excited to see what I did see. The smell of saltwater was in the air as we were very close to the sea. The show, scheduled to start at 8 PM, did start at 8 PM, give or take a few minutes. For the most part, there were a lot of kindred souls at the show. I saw hippies, yuppies, and regular stiffs there. I guess the diversity of the crowd was one of the things that made the show as special as possible. The other thing was vomit-man sitting in front of me. He was dancing like he was communing with evil, and he threw up. He was also pushing the buttons of the security personnel until the finally threw him out in the middle of the first act, much to the delight of those around me. I can now enjoy the show in peace (or whatever peace was in a concert).   To be perfectly honest, I am not aas highly into Primus as the other people in the show. I have only 2 Primus CDs and could not remeber the song titles to save my life. Fortunately, Primus is one of the bands that you do not really need to remember all the song titles because all the songs sounded so good and had a certain energy to them. The show was just incredible. The only thing I realized that wasn't right was that Les Claypool didn't talk to the audience as much as the other frontmen of the other concerts did. He only started talking to people in the crowd towards the end of the show. In a way, it throws us off because we did not have a clue what was going on. The show had come and gone and all we remember was how great it was, and how Les Claypool was really cool and how Tim "Herb" Alexander had an awesome drum solo (that I did not miss, mind you), and although I wasn't allowed to bring my camera in the show, I am able to remember all the happy moments that occurred on the night of June 23rd 2004 for more reasons than one. Primus was awesome!!!

      The 20th of June would have been an average, ordinary Sunday to me had it not been for a certain set of events on the said day. First of all, my friend from Vermont came down a few days prior to that, which is always a special event on my book. Secondly, Van Halen a night removed from playing at the Worcester Centrum Centre for their first show was playing there again that night, the only difference from the night before was that my friends and I were going to be in attendance. We have waited two months for this event and needless to say, the anticipation was all worth it. It was a great great show!  You knew it was going to be a good night when you can automatically get your seats upgraded. We did not even have to do anything. We got to our seats a full hour before the scheduled start of the show. Being primarily a hockey venue, we peered up on the Centrum scoreboard as they were advertising upcoming events that would get people to go to the Centrum now that hockey season was over. I saw that Madonna was playing the same venue the week after. I really didn't care, because for one thing, I was not a fan of Madonna or her music, secondly, the show on the night we were there would most likely blow that show out of the water.   The show's 7:30 PM scheduled start had passed, but not by much. The lights go out and in comes... the opening act. I should have known there was an opening act because the stage wasn't set up for a Van Halen show. For the most part, I could not make heads or tails as to what the opening band was playing. Given the fact that I have never heard of them before and they were playing original music, I still couldn't tell what it was. My friend, and fellow musician Dave (from Vermont) concluded that they would make a great bar band, but can't play larger venues because their set up just isn't that great. I agreed. I said that they meant well because they wrote and played good old-fashioned rock n' roll, but they should learn to control their volume and their set up because people just have a hard time hearing let alone listening to them. Big Masa, on the other hand, slept through the whole thing.  It was 8:30, the opening act was gone (Thank God!). I had to use the other facilities of the arena (i.e. I needed to take a leak), when suddenly the lights went out and I heard the scream "HELLO BABY!!!!" It was none other than Sammy Hagar! The opening of "Jump" played, and I ran back to my seat. It was the beginning of the greatest show that I had seen up til that point in my life. The stage was wonderfully set up and sound clarity was a lot better than that of the opening band (whose name, although I know will not be uttered at all). Van Halen continued to rock all evening, but what was most catching and a true tender moment was during the master, Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo. Eddie played the song "316", which was inspired by the birth of his son Wolfgang. He played it while sitting on the edge of the stage, he would then stop, but you could still here music. At that moment, I said to myself "where's the music coming from?" then out came Eddie's son Wolfgang playing the a replica of the guitar that Eddie was famous for playing. Wolfgang played the rest of the song while Eddie soloed to it. It was a truly tender father-son moment that at the time seemed so apropo, especially considering the fact that it was father's day.   The show ended (well for us anyway) after the band played "Panama", a song that I thought would make a great ending to a great show. The energy was all there. It was great! Even despite the fact that I missed Alex Van Halen's drum solo, which my drummer friend Dave would never let me forget, and I will never forget myself being in my obsessed with drums phase, the show was still the greatest I have seen. I have also learnt my lesson about consuming liquids before an important show. I shall never ever do that again. I took photos so that I may never forget. I doubt I will. Rock on, Van Halen!!

      As I have been dubbed with the name "Mr. Prog Rock" by many of my friends, I thought it to be an opportune time to write about something very "prog rock" indeed (if it was possible to use the term "prog rock" as an adjective), and these are rock symphonies. Rock symphonies are stories told in music without actors or dancers, which is what separates it from a musical. These rock symphonies range in time from 10 or 15 minutes to hours. These rock symphonies are commonplace among progressive rock groups such as Rush and Dream Theater. Rush has had a few of these symphonies like "2112" while Dream Theater thought it fit to have a whole album musically tell the story of a man solving a murder mystery in his dreams (Metrolis Pt.2 Scenes from a Memory). I think that these rock symphonies are very clever and when done well (I do not remember one being done badly), aare quite entertaining, although sometimes, stories are more difficult to articulate using music. Otherwise, it is very clever and artistic on the part of these performers to do such a thing. As a musician, I am floored by the musical skill of these artists, as a fan, I am in deep admiration of these guys because these rock symphonies are very entertaining and should be made more common.

      Rush is my favorite band of all time. In my humble opinion, they are, arguably, one of the greatest Rock N' Roll bands of all time. Unfortunately, they aren't as well known otside of Canada as other bands are. In my three years in the United States (in Manchester, New Hampshire, to be exact), I have heard more than my fair share of Rush songs on the radio, but a lot of these Rush songs came from their self-titled first album "Rush". Songs like "Working Man", "Need Some Love", or "Finding My Way" are more popular to the American public than songs like "Closer to the Heart", or "Spirit of Radio". After all evaluation and listening to the CD over and over again, I have come up with a possible solution as to why this came to be. It seems that there is a more bluesy rock n' roll feel to Rush's firtst album that really appeals to the American audience. The first album seems to have described Rush at that point in time, but not the next 29 years of their career up to the present. The common denominator to all this was John Rutsey.  Yes, John Rutsey, the man who pounded the skins for Rush during their 1974 release "Rush" and for the majority of the tour to support that record. The same John Rutsey that had left the band because as reports would have it, he was too fed up of it all. He was replaced by Neil Peart and well, as they say, the rest is history. Why are we picking on John Rutsey? The answer to this is that, we are not picking on John Rutsey, but rather we are looking into a parallel universe to see what direction Rush would have taken if Mr. Rutsey had not left the band.   In other to answer this, we must firstly ask "what did John Rutsey bring to the band?" John Rutsey was not a composer, like Neil Peart. He probably did not read as much as Neil Peart, which means that even if John Rutsey did write all the lyrics to the songs for Rush, they wouldn't be, for the lack of a better term, Rush-esque. They would most likely not be as creative as Neil Peart. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson did try their to write some lyrics, but we see who the better lyricist is in the band... Neil Peart! What would also be missing is The amzing drumming skill that Neil Peart possesses. It wouldn't capture the imagination of many young musicians. To be honest, a lot of people listen to Rush because of their individual mastery of their respective instruments. I do believe in my humble opinion that the "Rush mystique" would not be around if Mr. Rutsey continued to be Rush's drummer.  So, what would it be like if John Rutsey had never left? If John Rutsey had never left, Rush would have been a bigger hit in the United States, but there would be nothing to set them apart from every other rock band. Due to this, their career would not be going strong in the year 2004 and they would never have had the icon status that they have now in their limited circle. In a way, they would turn out like one of the bands on VH1's Bands Reunited. They would be great then, but no one knows what they would be doing in the present. Most of all, if John Rutsey never left Rush, there would never have been a 2112, and because of that, we, the fans of Rush should thank John Rutsey for stepping down as Rush's drummer because if that hadn't happened, Rush would never have been what they are now, the greatest rock band ever!

      PATHETIC adj 1: deserving or inciting pity; "a hapless victim"; "miserable victims of war"; "the shabby room struck her as extraordinarily pathetic"- Galsworthy; "piteous appeals for help"; "pitiable homeless children"; "a pitiful fate"; "couldn't rescue the poor fellow"; "his poor distorted limbs"; "a wretched life" [syn: hapless, miserable, misfortunate, piteous, pitiable, pitiful, poor, wretched]  2: inspiring mixed contempt and pity; "their efforts were pathetic"; "pitiable lack of character"; "pitiful exhibition of cowardice" [syn: pitiable, pitiful] 3: inspiring scornful pity; "how silly an ardent and unsuccessful wooer can be especially if he is getting on in years"- Dashiell Hammett [syn: ridiculous, silly]  What I’m Talking About:  I am 23 years old, and I would like to think that I am at my highest point in terms of social interaction. This is because I am young, vibrant, and some might say good looking (ok… no one does). I should be going out, as people who are my age do. I should go to clubs, bars, and what not. Unfortunately, I don’t believe in it. I am more of a home body. I would rather stay home and read, watch a movie, or listen to music. Even if I did go out, all I would do is go out to dinner or watch a movie, and nothing else. I realize that I will never meet other people that way, but it truly is what I prefer. I guess I’m turning into somewhat, of an old fogy, which is something I would never admit to ever again.  Relationships:  Do I really need to make more friends? I would really like to keep my friends to a minimum. In a nutshell, I am quite contented with the few friends that I have. Due to some traumatic past experiences, I feel I have lost the will to “expand my horizons” socially. I feel rather fortunate that I have had a chance to see the true colors of people who were considered friends to me, and to find out that they really weren’t. It hurt very much, but at least, it was a great learning experience. Not everybody gets the chance to go through this filtering process. I did, and I dealt with it accordingly.  No Man is an Island:  I can’t remember the first time I heard this, nor can I count how many times it’s been said. It feels like it got to the point to where the saying became cliché. Despite, its cliché nature, it is true and a lot of people do believe in it (myself included). Unfortunately, so do my parents.  No! I do not have a girlfriend, nor do I have any prospects. Unless, of course, if the term “prospect” in this context means girl whom I like, but do not have the guts to tell her or show her, in which case, I have a few of those. I know that I, one day, will have to find “the one”, I actually, I think I might have found her already. I’m just afraid that she won’t reciprocate. It is very complicated. We’re just in 2 very different points in our lives. Then again, is there any woman out there who is in the same point in her life as I am in mine? I didn’t think so, and I think I am rather wary of that fact.  I am a little old to not have a girlfriend, especially considering that I plan to get married and start a family. So is there pressure to find “the one”? I don’t really think so, although many people would beg to differ. I think that once I have found “the one”, we would naturally hit it off, and it would lead to living happily ever after. I really do feel that way, and it isn’t that I’m afraid of commitment. I’m not like all the other men out there who use this asinine excuse to not get married. It just seems odd that a man can love a woman, but can’t fathom the thought of spending their entire life with her and just her. That really isn’t love. In fact, I don’t know what that is.  This being said, my mother has tried countless times to set me up with any eligible daughters’ of her old friends. All she says to me is,”there’s no pressure, just try to be friends with them”, and just recently, even my father has tried to do the same. It isn’t like I can’t meet anyone by myself. They think I’m pathetic. I’m probably not for that reason, but I think the reason why I am pathetic is because I appreciate them for doing this for me, and I entertain the thoughts of going out with these set-ups. Thanks mom and dad! Will I be happy this way? That’s another issue!

      It is NBA Finals time again. Not only is it NBA Finals time, it is also the middle of baseball season. My allegiance in the NBA Finals lie with the Los Angeles Lakers whom I have been a fan of since 1983 (for those who keep count, I was 2 years old), during the time of Kareem, Magic, and Worthy. At that age, I thought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the coolest guy ever. If I was alive in the time that the Lakers played in Minneapolis and had George Mikan at center, I would have still been a Laker fan. Although now they are based in LA, thus their nickname bears no meaning, and I do not watch the NBA as much as I used to, I am still a Laker fan.  Last night, my judgement was somewhat questioned. How could I love the Lakers, but hate the New York Yankees? I am writing now to answer this question. First of all, it is not hypocritical to hate everything the New York Yankees stand for, and still be able to cheer for the Los Angeles Lakers. This is because the Yankees and the Lakers are not doing the same thing. It is a fact that both teams have the best players have the best players that money can buy in their respective sports. It is also true that they are both very dominant in their respective sports, but as my math professor says, which I think is apropo in this situation, "there is more than one way up the mountain". In which case, the Lakers and Yankees despite having these things in common, are not the same. First of all, it is not the Lakers' fault that Gary Payton and Karl Malone wanted to join them. The Lakers did not come off as a team who's ownership had unlimited monetary resources (like the Yankees do every off-season). Payton and Malone joined the Lakers because they felt with the recent history that the Lakers had, their best chance to win an NBA title is with the Lakers and in order to accomodate them, both players took a pay cut. If New York Yankees owner, George Steinbrenner ran the Lakers, he would have paid Payton and Malone more than they were willing to accept. To add to this, Steinbrenner would still try to get more free agents so he could buy the title. The Lakers clearly earn their championship if they win it (or at least they earn it more than if the Yankees win theirs).   So, why do I hate the Yankees? First of all, I've hated the Yankees for a long time now (even before I moved to New England). I guess it's just the New Englander in me that amplified my hatred for the Yankees further. Secondly, I feel that one exhibits no class when they become too greedy to the point that they will do anything to be successful, a class-less act like buying a championship. Championships are earned, not bought. You can buy a championship, but what's the point of doing so? it isn't worth much if you buy a championship. The Yankees have that habit, and the players who play for the Yankees have no soul. They just play the game for the money. They should be playing for the love of the game, not material wealth. Another thing I wish to address is the warped concept of "team" that the Yankees have. First of all, a team is not a bunch of individual that do their own things. A team is not just the sum of its individual parts. There's more to it than that. There is some sort of a family attitude in a team. The Boston Red Sox are a team. They are close and work well together, and off the field, they might even be friends. The Yankees are not, and will never be like that. it is one thing to pretend that you're friends with Derek Jeter in front of the media, but it is another thing to actually be buddies with him. Right now, the only friends that the Yankees players have is their money. Something about that is not right. The Yankees players have no soul and once the cross over to the world of Yankee pinstripes, they will forever be known as soulless androids who make millions and millions of dollars playing a kid's game, and playing the game for all the wrong reasons.   The Lakers and the Yankees are not the same. During their respective off-seasons, Gary Payton and Karl Malone chose to join the Lakers, not the other way around. As for the baseball off-season, the Yankees traded for A-Rod because they wanted to spite the Boston Red Sox, who didn't find the need for A-Rod. A-Rod, to some extent, probably played a major role in this whole spiting the Red Sox thing as well (you can call me paranoid, but I believe this to be true).   In the case of both teams, I have long decided what side of the fence I choose to stand on. I have pledged my allegiance to or against certain teams when I was younger, and I choose to continue to stay on the side I chose when I was younger. I'm not being a hypocrite. I just explained it to you.

      I was watching The Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame induction ceremonies on VH1 last Sunday night (3/21/2004). As I watched the whole cermony, I realized that I'm so happy that the Hall Of Fame is stil inducting real musicians and/or songwriters. After that, I pondered even deeper. I even got as far as thinking which of today's music stars will be inducted into the Hall Of Fame. A thought that is not to pleasing to think of, so why I even thought of it is beyond me. I realized that the title "Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame" is not just about Rock music, but rather about all music in general. Any of today's artists can be elected, but who is deserving? If you ask me, no one yet.  Today's music industry is more conscious on image and no longer pays attention to what is important (i.e. THE MUSIC!). If you look at the artists that sell the most records, they are artists that don't really do anything but sing. To be honest, anyone can sing. Don't get me wrong, singing is a real talent, but it isn't as great a talent as playing the guitar because there is a lot of theory and knowledge required to play an instrument. Today's artists don't even write their own music. Usually, there are other people who write these song (the "hitmakers", if you will). These people are the unsung heroes of the music industry. The other unsung heroes of the music industry are the session musicians that play the instrument as the back-up bands of these artists (who are not musicians, but artists. I use the term "musician" sparingly because they really aren't musicians). None of these people deserve to be in the Hall Of Fame (according to the committee responsible for voting people in). The wrold is running out of legitimate musicians and when that happens, who are they going to induct in the Hall Of Fame? Probably someone who doesn't deserve it like many of today's artists. Don't get me wrong, there are some good ones, but unfortunately, they're not getting equal air-time on the TV and on the radio because other acts whose music doesn't even make any sense are the ones that do sell. It is unfortunate that that really good musicians have a small following, while people who can't even play an instrument (or in the case of many of these artists, can't even sing) are getting rich in an industry that should not be about anything but music. The Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame should recognize the people who do their thing well, and not just those who people know as household names. Just like the Pro Football Hall Of Fame inducting offensive linemen, the guys who are not poster boys, household names, or in fact even known. They do their job and make those around them better. Do you think that a Loe Montana would be who he is if not for his linemen? That's exactly how I feel about the songwriters and back-up bands for pop singers. Do you think that Beyonce's music would sound good without her back-up band? But who will get all the recognition, fame, and more importantly (althoug it shouldn't be) the money? Beyonce does. The back-up band members get nothing. It truly is sad that an industry that concentrates on how something sounds can be conscious of looks, when it is something that is important and completely superficial. The worl really is running out of legitimate musicians, and in the long run, the music industry will suffer. I can't change it, but all I can say is, GO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT!

      Today, I choose to critique a CD I have had for a little over a year now. The CD of which I speak is a compilation of songs from Canadian Progressive Supergroup (and one of my personal favorites) , Rush. The compilation entitled "The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974-1987" is a 16 track piece of Rush's first 13 years of existence in the popular music scene. It is a great buy, especially considering that it came with a DVD containing the music video for Tom Sawyer, Closer to the Heart, and a third song that I forgot. (Apparently, I haven't been watching that particular DVD.)   There is a funny story behind my purchase of this CD. It was my very first Rush CD (my first legitimate one anyway, because my first Rush CD was a compilation CD that my younger brother was kind enough to burn for me before I left for Manchester, NH after Christmas break) . I've known the band Rush for the longest time, and I have always known them to be a solid rock band. I was a fan of the band since I was a young man (by that, I mean grade school because I am still very much a young man). All this time listening to Rush, all I had were a few of their albums on cassette format, which will not stand the test of time because I constantly wear them out. So that summer, I decided to get it in CD format but, instead of getting one of Rush's twenty-somewhat studio albums, I decided to get a compilation... for now. I did so, and what I got was this CD. I listened to it non-stop until the fall and early winter. This is when I decided that I wanted all of Rush's work, so I started to buy all of their work, and the rest as they say, is history.  Twenty-six CDs later (27, after "Feedback" comes out on June 29), I have completed my Rush CD collection. It would have been totally complete if I could find the "Archives" 3-LP vinyl collection. Unfortunately, I do not listen to records and "Archives" has been discontinued, along with the fact that "Archives" is just a re-release of Rush's first three records (which I already have on CD) it makes "Archives" unimportant in my collection of the Rush catalogue (but it would be nice to have). Now that I have established myself as the biggest Rush fan in Asia, I feel that I am qualified to write about the CD that I speak of, "The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974-1987".   As great a compilation as this CD is, I feel it is not as comprehensive as the other Rush compilation albums. Given the fact that it only encompasses one or two stylistic eras of Rush's now 30-year career (30th anniversary tour. YEAH!), it still isn't a complete summary of Rush's first 13 years. There were songs from older albums that I feel shoud have made into this CD, such as "By-tor and the Snow Dog" from 1975's "Fly by Night" album. Upon listening to the CD, I also feel that "Mission" from their 1987 album "Hold Your Fire", among others should have been included. Other than that, this would be a good compilation. It isn't as thorough as the other compilations (because it doesn't span the last 17 years of Rush's career), but it does have a lot of old favorites like "A Farewell to Kings'" "Closer to the Heart", and the big three from the "Moving Pictures" album, "Limelight", "Tom Sawyer", and "Red Barchetta". Included as the last track on the CD is "Time Stand Still" from "Hold Your Fire" (a personal favorite of my dear younger brother's), which is a powerful song about, of all things, growing old.   In general, this CD is not a complete representation of Rush's work in this 13-year span, but it is still a good CD with 16 fully solid tracks covered with prog rock goodness from the Canadian supergroup. It is still a great buy for many Rush fans or people who would like to get to know this band better, but if you want to get to know the band better than this CD will allow you to, just get all their other CDs. The price for this collection is steep, but it is so worth it. Better yet, catch Rush in a town near you (in the US, Canada, and Europe only) as they are currently on their 30th anniversary tour. I know I will (look out Los Angeles, California! Here I come!), or you can check their website at www.rush.com! You won't be disappointed that you discovered them (unless you're not into that kind of stuff).

      May 15, 2004 was a momentous night in one part of New England, (Lowell, Massachusetts to be exact) as the 35th Anniversary Tour of Yes rolled into town and rocked the Paul E. Tsongas Arena like there was tomorrow. Yes took the stage at 8 PM that night (gave or take a half an hour or so). The curtains opened and the colorful set was unveiled with all the lights and effects that no words can be used to describe. The members of Yes came out and started the show off with the song "Firebird Suite", followed by the impressive "Going For The One". The show would continued on it's frenzied pace until about 10 PM, when the members decided to take what they said was a 15-minute intermission.   The intermission couldn't have been 15 minutes long because I, personally, was beginning to get restless and just couldn't wait for the second half of the show... or when they play "Roundabout". All of a sudden, the stage gets dark and out comes Rick Wakeman in his Linus Van Pelt-like piano and he started playing a little solo which brought about the excitement of the second half of the show. The rest of the band came out with an acoustic set-up and started off with "Long Distance Runaround", a great choice. They would go on and play a great acoustic set. The song that I've been waiting the whole show for did not come out as a surprise because Jon Anderson and Chris Squire were talking about how the acoustic version of "Roundabout" (that was on disc 3 of Yes' 35th Anniversary CD) came to be. The band then started to play the bluesy version of their classic "Roundabout". It was great, but I wished they played the original version though. That was quite awesome. Much to my surprise, the group would end up playing an acoustic version of "Owner Of A Lonely Heart" as well, and that was the most mind-blowing acoustic performance ever. The acoustic set ended with a Steve Howe guitar solo that sounded like bluegrass mixed with a latin influence. It was insanely delightful.   After the lengthy solo, the rest of the band would come out again in their electrics, and belt out "Rhythm Of Love", "And You And I", and "Ritual". The would then leave the stage as if the concert was over. It probably already was, but the crowd clamored for more and as luck would hav it, they came back for an encore. They would play 2 more songs, a Betles cover "Every Little Thing", and would end the show strong with "Starship Trooper". After the show, there was a sense of wanting more for the Yes concert was a tremendously exciting, electric experience that if I had a chance to go see all over again, I definitely would. Live Yes, nothing beats it!

      Today, I bought another CD. Being "Mr. Prog. Rock" in my cirlce of musical friends, I decided to do a critique on Rick Wakeman's "Rick Wakeman Revisited" CD. As far as I know Rick Wakeman, who is the keyboard genius of the supergroup Yes is an amazing musician. Upon listening to the CD, I have confirmed the high level of virtuosity in which Wakeman displays his art. It is art indeed, what Rick Wakeman can do with his keyboards. It feels like a fusion of Medieval themes with futuristic keyboards (very truly "prog rock"). I also enjoy listening to Wakeman's version of the Yes classic "Starship Trooper" on this album. The song itself is tied in with another song called "Wurm", a song that I believe is a name for the jam that Wakeman does in Starship Trooper's dead time, and believe me, there's barely any dead time in that song, or any Yes song for that matter, but that's another story. Also included in the CD is a remake of the Rolling Stones' "Paint It Black" and the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby". In these remakes and his own music, Wakeman truly shows off his genius. Wakeman is truly an awesome musician and having bought this CD for $9.99 at F.Y.E. in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester is the biggest steall since buying Rush's "2112" for the same amount in Best Buy. After listening to the CD, I realize why I wanted to learn the keyboards (something I am doing so now), Wakeman, Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Ray Manzarek (of "The Doors"), and of course, Geddy Lee (singer, bass player, and synth guy for "Rush") are truly the best among rock keyboard players. Keyboards rule!

        I am not a music critic, but I am very opinonated on topics that I love to talk about. Since music is one of my loves, I must utter some of my opinions on it.     No one group has influenced more musicians than Canadian supergroup, Rush. Despite a relatively small following and little exposure outside of Canada, many musicians and music insiders respect the power trio's keen sense of musicianship. I am, indeed, one of the few musicians (or musicians in training) that love and respect respect this relatively little-known progressive rock group from Ontario, Canada. I am absolutely sure that I am not the only musician that Rush's music has touched. In their 30-year career (they are celebrating their 30th anniversary with a tour of North America, Canada and Europe), Rush has touched many musicians and fans alike with their music.    I have just recently discovered a rare tribute to Rush in the from of a CD from Magna Carta records. I realize that the CD was produced and released in 1996, but no one seems to know about it and it is very hard to find. This CD, titled "Working Man", puts together many of today's prolific rock musicians to pay tribute to arguably, ther greatest rock band of all time. Musicians like Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy, James LaBrie, and John Petrucci to former Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach. The contents of the CD does do justice to Rush's original versions, but also allows the musicians to add their own touches to the music, which actually complements the songs. Although Geddy Lee's high pitched voice, that was the Rush's signature during their first few records, cannot be imitated (in fact, I have reason to believe that even Geddy couldn't get that high anymore), many of the singers who have lent their voices to the album where able to make thier voices fit. In fact, some singers voices just fit the song very well. The rendition of "Mission" (originally from "Hold Your Fire") was an example of how the singer absolutely fit the song. The singer was Eric Martin of Mr. Big, and honestly when I first heard it, I thought it was a woman singing, but after a while, I realized it was just Eric and it sounded great. Better than any song in the CD, in my humble opinion, but this isn't a knock to the other artists who played on the other songs on the CD. Eric Martin's vocals on "Mission" was just really pretty. James LaBrie of Dream Theater also deserves mention, for he added great vocals to "By-Tor And The Snow Dog" (from Rush' "Fly By Night") and "Red Barchetta" (originally from "Moving Pictures"), as well as Sebastian Bach for "Working Man" (originally from "Rush"). As a bass player, I was absolutely overjoyed to hear Billy Sheehan and Stu Hamm on the album. They really showed us why they are among the great bass players of our time, as well as paying tribute to another one of the greats, Geddy Lee.    For a casual Rush fan, this is a great tribute album that will make you appreciate Rush for reasons that weren't there before. It will cause you to be a die-hard Rush fan and make you want to buy all of their records. For a die-hard Rush fanatic such as myself, this album rocks and it doesn't tarnish Rush's integrity or butcher their music at all. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested. It is a great buy!

      This post is a little delayed as I have just recently moved back to the Philippines and have had trouble settling down. Despite this, the events of July 7 is still and will always be fresh on my mind. I just flew in from Manchester that morning and was ecstatic because all of the events of this summer culminated with what I believed to be the number one event of the summer. Rush's 30th anniversary tour concert stop in Los Angeles, California. I was accompanied to the concert by my friend, Aris. We walked 6-8 miles from our hotel to the venue (a great work-out, and a great way to build up excitement). We finally, arrived with about 5 minutes to go before the 7:30PM start time. I made a stop at the merchandise booth to buy t-shirts. I was much jarred when the music started playing and I was nowhere near the viewing area. i didn't miss very much though because it was just a medley full of Rush's more well-known songs from the past 30 years. I couldn't keep my eyes off the stage area while I was finding my seat (something that makes searching for my seat more dificult). I finally found my seat and I found that I was farther away from the stage that I had thought I would be. It wasn't so bad though, because my friend, Aris was in a section farther than mine was. I did get to see a lot of the show and the sound was clear (which is a testament to how well built the Bowl was). Shortly after the show started, I went to look for my friend Aris to find a better seat and sit beside my friend.  The show itself was a spectacle with an amazing lightshow. The music was, as anticipated, very good. Rush was still a very tight group, something that 30 years of performing together would do. They did not make a single mistake during their show and still have more energy than your average 50+ year old rock stars.   After the medley, they started out with "Spirit of Radio", and "Animate". They would also go on and play songs like "Bravado", "Dreamline", "Red Barchetta" (much to my surprise because I thought they "retired" that song from their live set), and of course staples of a Rush live show, "Tom Sawyer" and "2112". Along the way, Rush also played an acoustic set of 2 songs, "Resist" and "Heart Full of Soul". This was preceded by the Neil Peart drum solo in which my friend described Neil Peart as "half man half octopus".  Rush also played some songs from their new EP "Feedback", which features covers of songs from bands that influenced each member when they were teenagers. The songs that were played in the show were "The Seeker", the affore-mentioned "Heart Full of Soul", and of course the first release "Summertime Blues" (which was part of the encore).   I was also somewhat disappointed not to hear personal favorites like "Closer to the Heart", and "The Big Money". Despite this, the show was great and after it ended, I wished I could see them again. Unfortuantely, I could not, but at least I was happy to have seen them one time. Rush is truly my favorite band of all-time, and this peformance was truly a one-of-a-kind experience that altered my life forever. This is because Rush really does kick ass! I am absolutely sure that there is a DVD and CD coming out for this event, if so, I will be in line for those items. It really is worth it!!!
