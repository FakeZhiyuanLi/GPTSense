      Well ... today was a weird day. I was supposed to wake up at 5AM to do my french letter, but I ended up ignoring the alarm and slept until 7AM when my mum woke me up. I ended up doing half a french letter, and stuff, and got to school and yeah read magazines and stuff... it got extremely windy ... like after my detention, I got out of the classroom and all of a sudden my dress flashed the entire quad, and Dolly and Em were laughing at me! Well, I saw Ema so she can't laugh. It was sooo windy today!!! A huge brach broke in history, tapping us out of the reality that it was just hell, with Mr Webster making us out to be damn fools because we got the answers wrong. Then this huge, huge tree in the teachers carpark broke from the bottom yet only hit a shed roof - no car. School wasn't so great, but I'm seriously thinking about petitioning about how balloney this uniform is. Tanner, is kind of a loner. I've been told that they're very shy. WTF?!!! I'm so confused. Oh well, I'm still paying attention ... but like I said it was Tanner, the slight loner. Tyler gets town recognition. But he is still a gorgeous one .... hmmm ... thinking ... on the way back, the train was moth infested with about a million going around, I was scared to death and am wondering where these giant moths are coming from, they're scary!! I'm going to try to go to sleep before 11 for a change, but I doubt that because tonight's the last night of Freetime and I'm going to be pranking like crazy ... it's Halloween today ... but I don't celebrate it anyways so ... if you're in Sydney don't get blown away!!

      Ugh, well more crticism on what Tyler looks like ... screw you all ... except the ones who agree with me.  But today sucked. I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE: Joanne, Ema and Jason. We spent a freakin 2 weeks trying to organise getting Jason to ask Ema to the formal, and when he finally does, Ema accepted ok ... but then she *sarcastically* says 'no' and he and her are now on the mutual ground that they're going alone. Big Whoop. And Joanne dumped Sandro because she thinks he likes somebody else ... and Chris and John are not going to the formal, but that's OK yet that means I can't set Ashton up with either one of them.(there wasa writing here but I deleted it)... Tyler is not only single, he's still Christian!! Yehaa!! Must finish P.E assignment and start French one ... I also have the feeling Ashton's going to end up going with Jason ...

      Hello, well I've just been having a little snooze outside by the pool and its really warm there ... tres nice. Well ... we (Carla, Ashton and I) went looking at formal dresses this arvo after school certificate trials finally finished today, so happy, but sad cos I missed out on all the classes where the teachers plan on bullying me! But the exams were good, believe it or not, I'd say math was my easiest, though the last couple of questions really sucked ... I saw this really nice dress in Mink (I think) it was light blue and I can kinda imagine that with lotsa silver jewelry (he he) or the black, either way would suit, but now I'm torn. Maybe I will opt for a long but haltered light blue dress or something, but now I got what I want in my head I must start thinking of shoes and stuff!!! Grrr for my fat feet!!!! Well, yes, still think Tyler's hot, Ashley got his email address so I actually MIGHT talk to him but I'm not so sure ... anyways, that's my day for now ...

      Oh yes ... well ... because of my "babysitter" after Friday night's incident with the firecrackers, I could not get to sleep, so I stayed awake and watched a few movies with Sarah ... including Scooby Doo, Sixteen Candles, A Pig's Tale, Willy Wonka, Max Keeble and to end the Happy Movie Time, we watched Road To Perdition, which seriously freaked Sarah out. If we ever have another one of these movie vegs, then we're gonna be watching The Mummy 1&2, The Scorpion King, stuff like that ... and LOTR!! But I've seen it soo many times ... well I really am currently bored because I slept all day and cannot sleep so I'm tryping useless information ... okay ... please note, Tyler Hoechlin's a cutie, he's in my grade (he he), he's less than a year older than me :) and yes ... my friend Grover (lol, Tara) is in love with his brother Tanner in year 9 ... pity her taste for the younger generation!! But NOBODY could compare to Tyler's he's just gorgeous Uummmm ... School certificate trials tomorrow!!! It's about 11:10PM on Sunday right now, this stupid US time clock ...

      mangomuffinhead says: mangomuffie ... No!OK, yesterday was pretty boring. I didn't go to church, cos dad and Gav went down the coast and left out family to give in to the tardiness ... so yeah, slept in for the remaining. Sarah came over after and we started doing prank calls on the neighbours, until my mum told us to stop. Then we started playing games and stuff, then, practically for the rest of the day, Sarah started dreaming about 3 guys (What happened to Sean, Preston, Nick ...??!!) called Tyler Dearborn (friend of Gav's, we met last year), whose extremely cute, Erik von Detten (*he he*) and one that we could BOTH agree on, Tyler  ... GRRR!!! He's sooooo damn HOT!!! Seriously, now this one is a keeper. We actually wouldn't have these crushes if stupid Ashley had shutup, but NO, she had to go on and tell us all about him, and how she now goes to his school and stuff ... I guess that's good we have inside contacts now, but yeah ... he's from Road To Perdition, and for once, these celeb crushes are right around our alley, being less than a year older than me (Hallelujah) coz he was born on Sept. 11 (his mum 4got his b'day in 2000) in 1987 and stuff ... SC Trials are coming up tomorrow, I haven't studied but since Sarah's already taken it, I know that I'm in for a haul, it should be hard ... still stuck on formal decision ... lol, I have to make sure these people are set up before we go: *Sandro & Joanne (they already are going, but Joanne wants to ditch him) *Ashton and YakMan (Seriously, Sandro's practically the key to the op, so if he drops out, it's all screwed *Sarah and David (PUH-LEEZE, like I'd really set them up. For pissing me off in Geo, I want them to sit together!! MUAHAHAHA!!) *Ema and Jason (Awwwwwwww - *he he* Sarah pranked him today - She accidentally thought it was Gus, lol. I've had no sleep, mum just came home from work, tired as ... I want to sleep, but I got that bloody AU Idol Rise Up song in my head ... GO GUY!!!! I'm planning on having a good relaxed day ... TYLER'S HOT!!! (*mental note: must write about Tyler sumwhere*)

      Well me bored, had a sleep which didn't last well because I didn't feel well after that lunch!! Wow, heck, what happened to the average sharing lunch? It turned into a bloody party. Ashton, Ros, Ema, Jo and I had our own little "healthy luncheon" thingy which we planned on Friday where it was strictly healthy food that we would share (we're copying an act of the Korean guys, though we don't leave little fish around) ... so why am I feeling so sick? Lunch consisted of: Tim Tams, Oreos, Chocolate Crackles, Tiramisu, Caramel/Rollo muffins, you get the drift? Healthy ... we had some ... salad (it was real), potatoe salad (which only Ema ate - ugh - supermarket bought SUCKS) and orange and passionfruit juice ... only the juice was really touched and the salad blew away ... next lunch Wednesday ... is KEBABS!! It's bound to be healthy with our own vegies coming in but hopefully it'll rock, it's fun though, but those stupid Year 9 losers came and stole half our food ... must've been one of Roselyn's weak days ... uuummm, so bored at the moment I think I'm going to write another chapter ... OH YEAH I BOUGHT MY FORMAL DRESS AT CASTLE HILL YESTERDAY!!! Sooo happy! It's slitely see thru but I'm fixing that up ... and jewelry is currently pearls for me ... GO GUY VOTE HIM 1902555562 or SMS 1889966!!!! Uuuummm, 2 more weeks of school (including this one) GREAT!!! Tyler still rocks, he he ... :P Buh Bye

      Well, currently bored to death, ppl are watching the stupid home movie where we're all stuffing those leftover cream pastries into peoples' faces FOR THE FIFTEENTH MILLION TIME and they love rewinding the part where Lindsay sticks half the cream bun into my nose. So I'm just gonna waste Rhiannon's internet bill ... actually I won't I don't wanna stay on too long ... went to church, reconciled with Sarah (for this week), and I guess that helped make it fun. Afterwards came home, went swimming and I wanted fruit so we went shopping and I ended up buying 2 watermelongs, 2 mangoes, 2 punnets of strawberries, 2 bags of bananas and 2 boxes of equal sweets ... evens everything out, though we would've bought two BAGS of mangoes but they aren't that well in season so we bought the best looking ones, and the watermelons are seriously delish. Yesterday was a total yesteryear (I actually can remember it but I don't wanna bother explaining) and my "secret link" to the Tyler site is all there if you're game enough to find it ... it might take awhile ... planning on having good weekend once I snatch that video off Rhiannon. Ummm ... swim was good, hair is currently in af mode ... and once got home yesterday I slept and slept ... caught up ... ALL HYPED!!! GO GUY SEBASTIAN - SMS GUY to 188-99-66 or CALL 1902-55-55-62 DO THE RIGHT THING!!! And I fully took those Tyler and Ash pics the wrong way, lol, she was fully flirting with Josh Hendersen (who, make not, is HER AGE or possibly older) even more, so I take all anger away from her ... and I snuck some pics of Grover in the pics page ... if you can find them ...

      Today was probably my worst day. I would have preferred another maths exam. We-ell, I've just been through a whole half hour of my brother laughing at me, I honestly don't know how to speak in public when given notice less than a minute before, and was called up with people who already had speeches (aka. Ashton and Roselyn) though I was alone (Ema - yup, yup, yup) ... and I've been making so many stupid mistakes today it's ridiculous ... I mistook the person who wrote Alice in Wonderland to The Narnia Series ... and I can't hear properly ... tired ... bye bye

      I'M SO FRICKIN GLAD!!!! SC IS FINALLY OVER!!! Yay!! I hate exams (who doesn't?) and I'm glad - it led off with a bang - history, geo, and basically I had the funnest time making up about five different two page explanations on stuff about World War 2, which I mistook for the Vietnam War for a sec (too many wars) and then I wrote about all this other jack about some other stuff. It's complicated, but hey, I don't care, school's finishing soon and ONLY 8 MORE EXAMS TO GO!!! Yeeha!!! Talking to "hot guy" a la moment, and I seriously still love Guy Sebastian, his song's the head song for my home page (did you hear it?? if you didn't, put your volume up) and I'm currently in an air conditioned room, away from all that yucky, sticky heat outside. Greetings from Holland! I'm heading to Puerto Rico!!! Ciao!!!

      Well, I've been so beat today, very tired and very worn out. I haven't studied - no, unfortunately, but I've just been lying down outside and that got me tired as. After I came back in, I started doing practice SC tests for Science and Maths, which makes me realise I'm gonna have to try EXTRA HARD on Science for tomorrow, I am seriously going to fail that. Maths I did OK, but still it's hard ... pity everything isn't like English ... average ... that's all I really need. I'm planning on doing something when I have the time, like study, but I might take a sleep.

      Hello!!!!!! I'm so happy, it's the weekend now and I can get so much sleep and everything and that's so cool because I say it's cool and all that stuff... today was fun, we got mufti and wore whatever we wanted instead of the freaking uniform though I had to take off my bracelets and necklace and stuff for the no jewelry policy ... and look what they do to us? They NOW say no flip flops so I'm screwed, it's so mean! But this weekend is a study weekend because School Certificate is on Monday and I'm actually going to be studying.  It's so weird. But I have to because I don't want to fail, like I almost did in science ... ohmigosh, three percent pass ... THANKYOU GOD!!! I saw Jessica C's formal dress pics, she's going to look sooo pretty, her stuff is so cute! Uuummm, Fisher's not leaving ... I'm not doing an Entertainment VET course, because there's no summer school for it (like I'd really waste my time with extra hours after school ... at least I'd leave 2 hours earlier) and stuff but it's all OK, I'm actually looking more optomistic. I'm ready for anything ... though I haven't got one of those 'Hello World' attitudes ... I wish I did though, I wouldn't be so afraid to do things and say what I wanted. Meredith got Tyler to autograph that picture of her, what a sweetie!! Ha ha!! Yay!! Bye byez ... Cath

      Hello .... about to go to sleep but wanna write ... apparently not too much is wrong with me, I have a pollup or something in my nose which is why it bleeds so much and hopefully I won't pass out again ... I WANNA DIVE!!! I spent my day kinda sad, my mum, in my tired state, took me formal dress shopping more and I was so tired it wasn't funny anymore. And I was so thirsty. But not hungry so that doesn't make me diabetic. We ate, came home now nothing big happened ... I took away Tyler's last name cos he's one hidden secret of mine now ... SCREW YOU ALL WHO THINK HE'S UGLY YOU HAVE NOOOOOO TASTE!!! Bye bye, and goodnight ... if you're studying for School Certificate on Monday ... have a drink of water ...

      Hello!!! Well, today's been a big day only a couple days til Christmas!!! I'm so happy!! Well, I won't write about what I got up to today because I don't want to write too much because my hands hurt, but yes, it's been a busy time of the month ... not woman wise or anything ... well, Ema left for Fiji today for a whole month, wow! And Imo's leaving on Christmas day to go visit Boston and Tokyo and stuff, and Ashton's leaving on New Year's to Tahiti and New Zealand that lucky bugger, she'll get to pick up some Polynesian babe while I'm stuck here, damnit. But I've made a few goals for the holidays which I'm planning to perfect while everybody's gone. Number one) I'm planning to perfect (and learn, lol) the electric slide, with Joanne (depending on her reaction to my idea) and Sarah (I didn't even have to ask her) so we're gonna take dance classes, but I don't want to take too many, just enough so I can learn the electric slide, it better be fun, lol! And of course, making the perfect chicken curry ready for the end of summer, I'm gonna make it the best! OK, Let's just put the subject of Chris Sebastian to rest, he's got some supermodel gorgeous girlfriend who goes to his church and has known for years and has gone out with for about a year, so he's taken, and poor Christine, Jeremy's taken by another girl too, though she seems ok with it which is magnificent. Lol, HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR!!! Those who are planning to party on with your friends, girls, equip yourself with a condom, pepper spray and a phone so you can get a taxi to come pick you up from whatever secluded house you might wake up in the next morning. Guys, no hitting up on girls unless they want it

      Well, yup, woke up late, missed church because my mum didn't go - I know that's still no excuse, but I usually only go if she goes, unless she's in Fiji and I go without her but she's not in Fiji and I didn't go ... I've been pretty OK, really relaxed through these holidays though some things have bugged me, but I keep them to myself ... does anybody (other than Miss Magnifique Ema) agree with me that Chris Sebastian's hot? I think so ... but nobody EXCEPT MME and me have seen him ... such an opportunity if you do ... OK I've been listening to Guy Sebastian CD all day or trying to fix my recipe for the Curry Challenge (me and Shannon are gonna make the perfect curry by the end of the summer - her's is fish/vegetable (EW) while mine's Chicken Curry - YUM!!!!!! I've discussed with dad, and he adores curry so he's going along with it, and I'm thinking of serving coconut rice on the side - though as Joanne said, it could be bland because there's already coconut milk IN the curry ... tsk ... any of you chefs out there please email me ... if I don't get this recipe down ... I'll perfect my ultra spesh POTATOE AND LEEK SOUP!!! Yummy!!!

I actualy thought he didn't notice me until I saw on camera and that was when it was too late!!! But not fretting anymore, I just want my hug, but I got into a weird but good fone convo last nite and was so happy about it. Dunno wat else to say but what a day! and SARAH'S GOT A HUGE TV

      Hihi - It's a New Year!!! Happy belated New Year!!! I went to the fireworks and it was pretty fun, it started off with Mum, Anne-Marie and I, we got dropped off at about 12, then Annie and I went to watch Scary Movie 3 (Lol, HILARIOUS - hehe, Michael Jackson part rules!!!) and then came back (by the way, its hard finding yourself from Bradfordsomething Park, to Milson's Point station, then from the station to Town Hall - damn city - and then once we got back we bummed around, saw lotsa people dressed up and stuff, and then Chris, Ryan, Crosby and Jan's mother came, then Corsby left to go pick up Jan from work and then they came back and Chris and Ryan had walkie talkies for Xmas and we were talking on the police channels, lotsa people must've brought their radios, lol, we talked to many people, especially Madonna, Arnold Schwarzaneggar (wateva), Baby Spice and Good Ol' James Bond - he he, brought to you by Anastasia, George Bush and Beyonce - and then apparently if you sound really good at making fake police calls, it might actually work ... *hint hint* "This is officer 9021829A Briggs, and I'm currently watching over The Opera House where we have a situation here. A hostage situation is being played out with a man, about 175cm, caucasian with a beard and an Armani suit. He is armed, I repeat, he is armed, and is holding a little girl at gunpoint. Please we need some assistance here, this girl is not going to survive on her own, so I repeat, we need some backup here immediately. Over" and then I figured nobody was listening, next thing you know you hear "What's your location?" and I said "Opera House stairs, do you copy?" and the next thing you know, you see about 3 - 4 police squad boats speeding out from the water into the Opera House dock ... I turned my radio off for the time so I wouldnt get tracked .... but I turned it on again to talk to Bondies and Madge... that was fun ... I watch LOTR3 today and it was so sad, IT'S OVER!!! NOOOOOOO!!! I proclaim it now the best movie I have ever seen ... I love Lord of the Rings, and I love Viggo, Orlando, Elijah, Sean, and the rest of their names I DON'T WANT IT TO GOOOOO!!!! noooooooo!!! Oh yeah, I've been to the beach and gotten alittle brown, and I'm getting the brown cuff Guess watch. Nitey, Cath

      Hmmm ... well I dunno I guess this can possibly count as the worst week ever ... naah ... though I did disappoint some people. I 'milked the cow' avec Ema to Fez, and didn't tell Ashton, slightly lying at first, then when she gave me permission to 'milk the cow', I told her and then she got mad at me :( not exactly that great. But that's heaps understandable, she could've made a fool of herself before and I cannot believe I forgot that bloody MINOR detail! Me and Em are soooooo stupid! Gosh, Fez said he would prefer to get to know Ashton alittle more better and then he'll see - HOW DUMB AM I????? I cannot believe it, I crushed Ashton's hopes and now the glimpse finally was remembered URRRRRRRRGH! How dumb am I? Well anyways other than that, in language usually only Ros can understand but if you're a close friend you'll understand. Bill is a bitch. Ashton suggested that Bob/Og was going out with Bill and then now I find out Bob is a bloody one man show, taking whatever he can get on ANYBODY! Ugh, damn, why do I still like this guy? Only God knows apparently. Um, oh yeah I missed dinner and practically everything last night cos I went to bed about 5-5:30 to get some sleep after school and I woke up at 3:30 this morning! AHHHHH!!! I was still in my uniform so I had a shower, went back to bed and this morning was OK, I guess, I dunno, it all led up to my complicated day. Anyways, dun wanna talk about that not much more. Gots to go, Cath

But hey at least this dude can remember my name which is more than I can say that I guy number 1 (I was talking about 2 - the one I'm starting to really actually like) but yes, complicated life. No more details I don't trust the internet. WOO-HOO for the weekend, it's much needed. Luv, Cath

Ummm, I went to a d-c avec Joanne on Sunday and it was HEAPS FUN!!! Hot, but fun. Ugh speaking of hot, it's been HEAPS BAD lately the humidity is absoloutely choking me and I'm sweating out so bad, thank goodness deo was invented.

      OK day today, we went on an art excursion, assembly was boring, stupid kis in my roll marking almost blew his hand off with a party blower, but thank goodness Mr Goltz dealt with him after or I would have - but I didn't cos I got to miss school! Train was OK, and things were fun, the art show started off in an auditorium with all these talks from ex-HASC students and I loved the works especially the 'Apocolyptic Nightmare' and all the works on this girl's grandfather, and the talks were slightly extremely boring. Um, after that we were permitted to walk wherever and me and Joanne went looking for inspiration - finding absoloutely nothing. But the works were heaps good though, loved them, especially the charcoal at Art Express. There were lotsa boys schools there and so many of them were so hot, yet every time we took our eyes off them they ended up disappearing. Then at lunch Jay, me and Mr Sir went to this hotdog vendor where I almost burnt my tongue on hot sauce and Joanne on her hotdog, and there were cool pics of 'famous people' there - woo hoo Frankie Muniz! Um, then we went back (through my direction) and eventually watched more cids and spied on more hot guys. Also, before the whole excursion Ema and I found a fone on the bus and apparently gay Benny something from wherever - ewwww! I am never reading gay sissy boys inboxes ever again! American boys - be aware of sissy Aussie boys - they write stuff like 'Oooh delicious american boys on my bus, I'm dying!' Mr Kelvin Chang - gross. But this sissy Mr Ben was gay and it disturbed me. Um, not much else happened after, nup, except I finally finished my Part 2 of MBA!!! AND JAY'S BDAY TOMORROW!!!!! WHOOP! - Bye!!!!

      Yikes! I haven't written in this for so long, so much stuff on my site has been expiring and Miss Maitenance has forgotten! Tsk! Bad old me ... let's see, what new junk has happened? Well, I did eventually get baptised, it was fun, then I saw more ppl on dreaded April 10 and that was all my fault I had to say sorry to all of them and felt way bad, I am such a mean person. But yeah still have not returned DVD rentals, I must make that happen! Um, went on a geo excursion yesterday (wait ... actually 2 days ago) and it was fun, the work wasn't too hard but I'm way tired, mostly from studying I have a maths and business test TOMORROW and I dont have my business notes with me! Gadzooks that's not a good thing and I lost my maths book *sigh* I guess I'll hafta fail on my own :( ... hello
