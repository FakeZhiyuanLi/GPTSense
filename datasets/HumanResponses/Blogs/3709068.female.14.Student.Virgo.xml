      I hate this typing thing. I type something up and it's deleted...*twitch* well nevermind that.   I have discovered the secret to why Heero Yuy never dies when he commits suicide.  Duo is afraid that if Heero dies, then he will never get to have hot yaoi mansex again because Quatre and Trowa are never leaving each other and Wufei is just ugly. So whenever Heero tries to kill himself, Duo just goes on break, which really pisses off his employer, because he gets paid breaks.  Metal Dungeon sucks. Never rent a game you've never heard about, because it will most likely suck. They call it a horror game? HA!! I get creeped out more by Elmo's World than I do this game.

      Today I am at Amee's house. She has(or had maybe) this idea of making a HP story focusing on the lesser houses if Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. And I got my own character ^_^ so I had to be sorted into a house.  So I'ma taking the quiz thingy and guess what? I get Gryffindor. =.= Great, I share house with "I-know-everything" bitch and the amazing reproducing weasels.(Weasleys) (STOP MATING DAMMIT!!!) And as I sit in the thrilldom of being a Gryffindor I wonder "why me?" I mean I should at least get Ravenclaw, if anything. Amee got Ravenclaw. I get multiple redheads. Everyone gets into Gryffindor. WHY CAN'T I GET SOMETHING ORIGINAL?!?   Gryffindors are all honorable and noble and brave and crap like that. Honorable? Do I look like I'm from Ruroni Kenshin? AM I A GODDAMN SAMURAI?!? Noble? Hell, I belch whenever I feel like it. I am known to sit with my legs apart whilst wearing a skirt. DOES THAT SOUND NOBLE TO YOU?!? And finally, brave. I can't go through one episode of Unsloved Mysteries without cringing and wanting to call a friend to comfort me.  I ain't a Gryffindor. I am a Ravenclaw. Hell, I am more Slytherin than Gryffindor(er...I think...) Why would I be Gryffindor? So I'll just sit here in my "wonderful" House of Gryffindor and not stare at the twins's asses.   Mood of the Day: Sadistic and hungry...I WANT FOOD!!!*puppy whine* Bishie of the Day: Most Definatly NOT the twins. NOT. *is NOT staring thank you very much.*

      So as I was sitting and waiting for my brother to finish up his game of...TWISTED METAL BLACK!!! so that I could play the glorious Xenosaga, I decided to come up with something fun in my odd little brain. Comparing my favorite game with a crazy clown to my favorite show with a clown who is dating a blonde "male" creature.   As I sat I thought about all the ways they were similar and, suprisingly, they were very much the same....(conspiracy!!)   TM: Black's storyline: play as a crazy person who may or may not have committed various crimes, seek revenge for something, or have serious mental issues. Gundam Wing's storyline: 5 crazy boys with traumatic pasts have to go around committing crimes to seek revenge for something, or just because they have serious mental issues. TM: Black's goal: to kill everyone else so that they can win a wish!! Yes this sounds lame but they have really sadistic wishes.... Gundam Wing's goal: kill all the members of OZ so they can get their er.... wish of peace I suppose. Well, It's a wish, ain't it?   Heero Yuy: he killed a little girl and her doggie and so now he's traumatized. Is stalked by Relena Darlien/Peacecraft/Yuy/ whatever and he threatens to kill her. Heero is 'the perfect soldier' so he's kind of  cold killing machine. TW counterpart: Outlaw: a cop who killed a little girl so now he is traumatized. May or may not be stalked by Sweet Tooth, who threatens to kill him. Is also a cold killing machine, though he really doesn't realize it yet.   Duo Maxwell: some hyper-ass who enjoys talking and having pretty hair. He also enjoys killing and is Death incarnate. Has many many many fangirls who want to run their hands through his long, silky hair. XD Has no parents and is a orphan who was brought in by the church but then the church was bombed (I think...-.-;;) TW counterpart: ....uh I dunno! Duo is pretty original. There is the church man who drives Brimstone... in some ways he could be compared to him... but not really =.=  Quatre Rabinna Winner: an adorable little blonde boy who really doesn't like killing, but kills anyways. He's most definitely the classiest Gundam boy (we ain't counting the OZ peeps) and he likes TEA!!! (personally I only like really sweetened ice tea, but that's just me) He seems to be the shortest cuz everyone else is so tall and intimidating. His mommy was killed giving birth to him. :'( TW counterpart: as creepy as it is, Yellow Jacket: a little boy who is really smart. He hangs out with his daddy a lot... even though his dad is dead. The little boy re-animated the corpse. So he isn't much like Quatre but he has the adorable blonde kid thing working for him.  Trowa Barton: He's quiet. He's a clown. He has some memory issues if I remember correctly. And his hair is kinda weird. TW counterpart: Sweet Tooth: evil clown who kills things and his head is on fire. So he has wierd hair. If he ain't Trowa I dunno who is!!  Wufei Chang: He's kinda ugly. He's kinda mean, but he wuvs his dead wife("THIS CONCEPT OF WUV CONFUSES US!!!" -Futurama) Wufei is chinese so they gave him a wierd nose. This is probably why they made him so ugly, just because he is Chinese.... :'( TW counterpart: Junkyard Dog: A ugly dude with a screwed up nose, who constantly mourns over his dead wife. Junkyard Dog is a hick.  Relena Darlien/Peacecraft/Yuy/oh who gives a s***?! : Can you say "Peace and love"? And not the good kind of Peace and Love that Vash preaches? A blonde lady who is in love with Heero and thinks that he loves her back. (I dunno if he does or not.) She dislikes the war and wants peace forever(Feh. PEACE IS THE QUICK BREAK THAT THE NATIONS NEED TO REGROUP BEFORE THE NEXT WAR!!!)  TW counterpart: Bloody Mary: a chick who is always sad because the one guy she ever liked rejected her. She went into serious denial and ran around killing people who got married. She is very sure that her one true love is just playing hard to get so she chases after him. (although is Relena ran around killing people I would have a much higher opinion of her!)  Mood of the Day: Sugar high Bishie of the Day: Nick D. Wolfwood.

      Okay. I took a quiz to see what FF guys I am most compatable with.   This is what I got.  1. Vincent Valentine ( I agree. Wholeheartly.) 2. Kuja (WTF?!?! UGLY!!! MAN!!! SCARY!!)((just found out Kuja was a man... sort of thought he was a girl...)) 3. Irvine (Do I have a thing for guys with guns? ew.. that came out wrong...) 4. Zidane (ugh...isn't he a pervert? I HATE PERVERTS) 5. Sephiroth ( Dude looks like a lady...sorry, but I can't stand it when guys are prettier than I am.)  So I pretty much hate these results. Except the first one. Mmmmmm..... Vincentilicious...

      I just saw a pic of a game about the FF7 Turks. It may or may not star Vincent Valentine....   I'm so happy that a vein in my brain burst. Now, I am kinda having difficulty seeing..... BUT I AM STILL HAPPY!!!!  This shall be my Vincent Valentine shrine of    Why I love Vincent Valentine:  1. His sad, sad story: for some reason I like men with traumatic pasts. Like Heero. Vincent's story is so sad. And he really needs a girlfriend. 2. His mean cruel attitude: He's so cold. ^_^ Just like me sometimes...  3. His philosophical ways: HIS QUOTES ARE SO TRUE!! Even if most of the time they aren't exactly ...postive. well okay most of them are downright depressing, buuuuuuut..... 4. He's not human: I don't like humans. Period. And technically, he's not human, he's an expirimental mutant. 5. His general prettiness: Let's face it. He is damn sexy. WHOOOO!  well, this was short as far as my blogs go but that's cuz I didn't have much to talk about. Oh well...^ ^;;

      Xenosaga....Xenosaga... your graphics are pretty and your sound is good too, you plotlines good in the beginning, but in the end stink like poo. (tch...least it rhymes...)  How could you go wrong Xenosaga? You had all the makings of a good game. Good graphics, good sound, amazing cimatics, basic RPG characters (smart chick, main heroine, tough male figure, etc.) and even a couple of girls in skimpy outfits so that guys would actually play it. It is sooo good to play, but in the end things kinda fall apart.  It's still an excellent game, but man do the plot ideas in the end SUCK. A guy who looks like a 12 year old who is really a synthetic human (kind of a humanoid robot) loses his 12 year old girlfriend, also a synthetic human. They go to get her back, for she has been kidnapped by some pyshco who can regenerate anything(I mean anything. Head, arm, leg, anything) ,and thus some DBZ remnicient yelling and power-upping ensue.   Then a dude with a crow-like mask and purple (yes, PURPLE) sith cape thing show up. Then the crazy limb regenerating dude runs away in his mecha( I like his mecha a lot. It has wings on it and it is HUGE. so pretty ^_^) But it is just such a weird thing because NONE of this focuses on the real main girl, Shion Uzuki. In fact, it just focuses on the 12 year olds. Now I don't know about you, but cute stuff, for the most part, nausiates me. This is cute angst. This is so nausiating I wished my dad didn't keep locks on the gun cabinet.   Yes, it's that cute.   But don't forget the human rights and environmentalist stuff! Oh yes, play this game and you get to hear Shion spout off every five seconds on how these sythetic humans and androids and cyborgs should be treated as equals, and how you can't  take the life of another human and blah blah blah...   I don't play a game to get nagged at. I play it for the pure entertainment. Not for the morals.   This brings me to why I am so happy they made KOS-MOS, the android, the way she is. 1) She is probably the strongest fighter in the game. That's pretty much a first for any female in games. And 2) She is a ruthless killing machine. You get in her line of fire while she is fighting and you better be praying for your soul. And she never stops in a fight. If she runs out of ammo with a gun, she beat people off with it. She really doesn't have much emotion. She is cold as 0 degrees kelvin most of the time. Sometimes she is somewhat nice and sympathetic, but that is pretty rare.   I give Xenosaga a 4/5  Mood of the Day: 1x2 supportive Bishie of the Day: Balmung of the Azure Skies
