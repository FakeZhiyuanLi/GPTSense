      How do trends in Kuwait come about? One day it's nonexistent and the other everyone's wearing it. Muhajebat always manage to get my attention purely by their layering prowress and funky hijab fashions. Whoever came up with the 'disco ball' hijab should be shot. That scarf is a safety hazard. I know numerous people who've been blinded at direct eye contact with it. Another that manages to irk me is the hijab with fluff attached. No one quite knows what the fluff is. Are they tiny feathers? Lint from washing the hijab? Loose threads, clues that the hijab's falling apart? It creates a virtual halo around the wearer's head. The safety hazard is your crashing into a wall trying to solve the mystery.   I can't wait for winter. The season where everyone wears their winter clothes regardless of the temperature. Hey, if it says December on the calender..but then again, Australia's summer are during winter months. Who cares if it feels that way here? It's amusing seeing muhajebat wearing knee length skirts with knee length boots &amp; tights..hey, as long as no skin's showing they're wearing proper clothes!

       I'm back from girls' nite out :) Had a fun time @  La Piazza . It's the first time I've ever been to it. I've been to 2 'grown up' restaurants this week. First it was  Square , now  La Piazza ..what's happening to me? I'm not used to restaurant hopping. I've never been one of those girls who show up at every new restaurant dressed to the nines & checking other people out. I'm still not one of those girls but will I morph everytime I go to these places? I must say I like the atmosphere of those restaurants more than the ones on Khaleej but part of me misses the noisy vibrant energy of Friday's.   I can't really see myself as a grown up. I should. I'm old enough @ 23. I've graduated. I'm trying to get a job (sort of)..why can't I accept that and should live up to the role? Trying to recapture an adolescence I never really enjoyed?

       This is how we do it.   It's Friday night, and I feel all right   The party is here on the West side   So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up   Designated driver take the keys to my truck   Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded   I'm getting ready to an evening out with friend & entourage. I haven't been spending much time at home and it's a welcome change. I'm in a mood to be surrounded by noise, bodies,&nbsp; and Kuwait's laidback love of life. There needs to be more of a nightlife here. I enjoy what there is but sitting around checking other people out gets old quickly.

      Testing 1, 2, 3  Due to my inability to pay rent, with unemployment and all, I've decided to relocate my old journal to its new humble abode. No advanced blogger status anymore but we'll make do ;)   Chief issues to tackle: 1) Letting everyone know of the address change 2) Transferring my old archives (help!)

      Do you believe in horoscopes? I know trusting in them too much is taboo, yet I do find some truth to them. A friend cast my profile based on the date & time I was born and came up with this. It's paints a pretty accurate description of me, though I disagree with not being loyal or faithful :/ So here you go, this is what would go into my bio ;)   People born with their Moon in Gemini are generally easy-going and good natured. Your emotions can run the gamut from one minute to the next. If you’re unhappy, you rarely stay that way very long. You are sociable and probably have a large circle of friends who enjoy your scintillating conversation. Moon in Gemini people love communication  You are never at a loss for words and you love debate and controversy. This is true about your emotional nature as well. You would prefer to talk about and rationalize your emotions rather than feel them! You have a tendency to be nervous and jumpy and it can be hard to know what you are experiencing emotionally as you can flit from one emotion to another. You have been called the emotional Jeckyl and hyde  You are infinitely curious, love learning new things and sharing that information with others. Your mind never stops buzzing, but that buzzing can drown out what you are feeling. You may not stick with anything for a long time. You can be fickle with your emotions and with your partners. You are always eager to meet new people and experience different kinds of relationships. Loyalty and faithfulness are not your strong points. You love your freedom and don’t like being restricted by the emotional demands of others. Clingy people need not apply! You have a wonderful sense of humor and are very witty, however, you need to watch your tendency to be sarcastic  You probably displayed your quick learning ability and your cleverness at an early age. Moon in Gemini people most likely had parents who encouraged their intellectual and mental ability but may not have nurtured your emotions as much. Moon in Gemini people are our emotional Peter Pans  Your ascendant in leo: You love your freedom and don’t like being restricted by the emotional demands of others. Clingy people need not apply!  The ruler of Leo is the sun and it is therefore also your chart ruler. You are in control most of the time as well as being loyal. You give a sense of warmth and caring. You are open to most people but your dignity is very important to you. You have a need to be liked and respected and at times you may become domineering. Your temper is quite fiery but not long lasting  You recover from any upsets quickly. You are extravagant and your gestures are large. This can at times get out of hand and be too over the top. You stick to what you believe in and can be stubborn. Sentimentality and romance is important to you and you are very caring towards your friends. You like luxury and flamboyance and often act quite dramatically.

      The more this country represses its society, the more uncivilized people are going to get.  Just drive down Share3 el Khaleej for a taste.
