      I love to wright but Have a Lurning disabilaty that makes it very hard for me to spell . It also makes punctuation very dificult for me ( I spell Every thing like it sounds ) .  This is one of the first things I ever wrote .&nbsp; it is called the&nbsp; mundane train  &nbsp;  As he walks through the door he flashes a smile and starts a quiet Conversation about some common pleasantry. But as he walks out into the night, he looks up at the stars and his thoughts go inward, and he sees things that no one else can as his imagination runs wild. he knows he is an out sider.   Most could never under stand what makes him tick.at times his thoughts sound of sorrow because he does not fit in . Other times, when he’s alone , he gets scared because he feels like he is starting to conform with society. but it is impossible for him to fall in line with society’s mundane train.  Because being different, a thinker, a dreamer, not a follower is not something the we can change. It’s not an option, it’s who we are . we outsiders are the special ones, but we are so hard on ourselves that we don’t realize it. If it where not for outsiders like Socrates, Albert Einstein, Plato, and even Chuck Yeager, the world would surely be a different place. They did not fit in. they never conformed. yet, they are the ones who shaped our world.  the world has changed a lot over the centuries but one thing has always remained the same ; people Destined for greatness live out side the norm. If they where conformists, they would just be ‘ Society Joes’ So remember ,if you don’t fit in, don’t feel bad. You are privileged to be in the Company of those who shape the world.

      Reaper  Sitting in my Dimly lit Cottage over looking the faint moon lit sea as the sounds of the sea and her Memories echo in my mind. As the light house light flashes threw my Side window I see the grim Reaper sitting in the rocking chair rocking slowly to and fro and the echoes of the sea and her memory echo in my mind. The light house flashes again and the light that has shown many a saler his way home Brings only hour and despair and the reaper rooks to and fro and the sound of the sea and her memory echo on. I fall from my chair and beg forgiveness for my sins and for my body to be spared to see the light of day and the reaper lafts with a hallow scream of a sound I feel down in my sole. As the light Flashes and the reaper rocks on I can’t stand this weighting I Can’t stand this unknown. I see the door but I lack the ability to stand and run as the sound of the sea Her memory and the sound of his lafe echo on. God please help me for I am too young to dye. I beg but the reaper Just lafts again as I explode from every pore with sweet and tear another flash from the lighthouse and to my hoarer the reaper stands and walks toward me with his cickle held hi. With a hiss of a voice he does begin to speck. “ Now you beg for life and Cary on like a child when for so long you have wasted life living in the passed and hiding out from the world in this place by the sea,” The light flashes as I timidly look up with crocked neck and see his Faint eyes and what looks like a crocked smirk looking down at me from his hooded head.  I bow my head and lament the lords prayer and I hear the reaper say “ now you call to God witch you have renounced for so long now you pray and ask forgiveness from him you have cursed for so long. And to my surprise as the light flashes again he says get up from the floor and be seated and have a little dignity for now I hope you realize what you have and will use the time left to do some good. For tonight I come to take the bad memories that echo in your head. But one day I come to take you and let it not be here and not like this for it would shorlly be a shame  get up and get on with it and do not dotle any more for when I come back I hope you have found your peace so that the sounds of the sea and bad memories do not echo in your head. But sounds of lafter and good times had as you draw your last breath will fill your head. And as the light flashes the reaper is gone and I feel a new purpose and know I must heed his words and find peace in my sole before we next meet.

      BIG JAKE  There sits big Jake up on the heist hill over looking the cow pin looking out over all that is his. Most days you could walk right up to him and pet his big fury head but today we work cows and he knows what that means. It would take 6 cowboys 6 hoarse and 5 ropes to get the damn near 3000 pounds of Bramer bull off of yonder hill really it would only take 5 cowboys and horses but at lest one of them is gone bleed so you might as well send extras if you know what I mean. All the other cows and calf just fall into line we round them up and direct them into the pin but not Jake he will amble on down here as time goes by and walk right in the shot on his very own but it took us a few year to learn this and to tell you the truth I about shot him several years back because he damn near killed me, five other cowboys several horses and my new pickup look like it had meet its fate I swear that bull did that just to prove a point and piss me off. See we got 250 head of cows on this here plot and almost as many calf this year it was a good year yes indeed. But only one bull Big Jake yes-sear re. See old Jake is the king and all this his kingdom and charges he takes care of them all and watches over them like a father. It is a shame we are not all more like old Jake strong and the king even if only of our selves. So many people these days are like these dammed old Cows just going where their lead not even wondering why. The other night I had to lafe at my self I walked threw the door and old missy my wife was sitting one the couch looking at some magazine that had all these pretty boys in it stomachs all rippled and faces all pretty and hair looking just right GQ or something like that I think it was called any how. I walked in the bath room and took of my cow shit covered shirt and as I turned to throw my hat up on the shelf I saw my reflection in the mirror and I found my self stopping to take a look and try to pinch a roll of fat across my gut then I had to smile there I stood worried about how I look with hands tuff as leather from years of hard work scares all across my mid section from being kicked threw a barbed wire fence, a scare on my face from being gored by a bull and a crooked smile from to many years of chewing tobacco. Besides what do I care how I look I could never under stand toughs pretty boys. I am twice as tuff as they are and could kick there prissy asses any way lets see how many women get the hots for them when they try to do what I do for a living just one day can you say bloody messes. Any way sorry about that I got side tracked and here comes big Jake now off his hill and down here to take care of business we just cant keep him in here to long or things might get tuff so next time you go to do something just remember are you a cow or the king bramer living on your terms come what may.  10-27-03 Mike Breen
