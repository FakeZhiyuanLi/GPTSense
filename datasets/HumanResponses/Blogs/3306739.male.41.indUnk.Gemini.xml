      Well, this is the jumping-off point, my first entry. My initial motivation for blogging was to share the wonderful interactions I have with my two young girls. In ordinary day-to-day interactions, there are so many cherished moments that warrant some sort of remembrance or preservation. It is my hope that my blog will become a time capsule of these moments.

      Each night there is the grand ritual of getting ready for bed. My two girls, S.(age 4) and K.(age 2+)create some wondeful moments during this time. S. is particular about how her blankets and bedspread is made and will even call out in the middle of the night for help to straigten them out before she'll fall back asleep. Sunday night, as we prepared for bed, I mentioned to S. that she sure left the bed rumpled after her nap and that she should straighten the bed up before putting on her pajamas. She looked at me with a look of dismay, rolled her eyes and in an exagerrated gesture, slapped her upturned right hand into her left palm and matter of factly stated; "Dad, I'm only 4. I can't read, I can't drive a car and I can't straighten a bedspread."  As I rolled on the floor laughing, I couldn't help but wonder which of the three she'd master last. My bet is straightening a rumpled bedspread.

      Tuesday afternoon brought the adventure of taking S. to her dance class. This is the third week of class; the first week Mom was able to take S. and during the second weeek, Dad forgot to take S. to class. The class is sponsored through the local YMCA, but is held at a synagogue in town. Parents and other siblings are not allowed to stay in the classroom while the class is held, but are afforded the comfort of waiting in another area where there are toys and other diversions. Having forgotten to take S. for the previous class warranted a thorough and in-depth briefing by Mom covering as many particulars as she could as well as an admonishment not to be late. The girls and I arrived early and we were the first ones there. This made it easy to meet the instructor, apologize for the missed class and getting S. settled, but left K. and I wandering the synagogue in seach of the waiting room. Having apparently taken a wrong turn, K. and I ended up in the sanctuary portion of the synagogue. Although not yet three years old, K. recognized the space as a place of worship and inquisitively asked, "Where's baby Jesus?" As we quickly pirouetted with my hope of finding and following a parent in the know, I replied, "Well, baby Jesus isn't here but his Dad is." Happily, K. was content with that response as we found the waiting room and retreated into the innocence of play time.

      Now that S. is closer to being 5 years old than to 4,&nbsp;she can for the most part,&nbsp;get dressed by herself, I usually just have her open the dresser drawers and pick out what she wants to wear. I have to help a little with the color coordination but other than that she does a good job putting together her ensemble. This morning she wanted to wear a simple pullover knit dress and so as I tended to K., S. was left to her own devices. After finishing dressing K. and putting her shoes on, I looked over to see S. flopping about, entangled in her dress. I asked her if she needed some help and exaperated, she replied, "Yes!". So I straigtened out the dress, pulled it over her head and asked her, "Did you lose your brain?". She promptly replied, "NO, I'm talking to you, aren't I?"

      Mom took S. and K. over to see Nana and Papa on Sunday afternoon and on the way back it started to rain. As they drove up the driveway, past the house, S. noticed the rain coming out of the gutter spout. She quickly asked her Mom, "Hey, is that where the spider comes out?"
