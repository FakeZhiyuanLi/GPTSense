      Dear Citizens of Nashville,    I would like to apologize in advance on behalf of my parents who will be visiting Nashville for the weekend of August 2.  Please disregard the things they say which at times will likely be off color or rude.  Please forgive them as they are ignorant, conservative, republicans from California.  They know not what they say not because they have been drinking but because they are ignorant.   If you overhear them please just do your best to ignore them and please don't fault me.  I have tried to teach them the ways of the open minded. I have tried to teach them the ways of the liberal, but they just don't hear it. Thank you and again, I apologize.    Alison

      You walk away and as the time passes your squashed heart begins to heal. You don't see her for weeks. Then when you do you stumble for a moment, but realize that it's not so bad. You gain interest in other things, other people and other places in your life.  You see that you do deserve better, you see that your friends were right.  You no longer think of her the moment you awake nor the moment you go to sleep at night. You quit secretly telling her you love her.  Your heart is finally in a good place. Then she writes, then she wants to get together, she assures you only as friends, only platonic, without any strings.  However your healing, weak  heart begins to consider falling again. All over again. For what? Just to break again, just to go through again what you didn't think you could live through the first time. You say never again, not this time, I won't fall, I won't be duped in her seedy game, I am going to make it.  But just when you finally begin to  make it, she writes.

      Go fish, a childhood card game. A 1994 black and white documentary by Rose Troche and now a game of wits and jealousy that she and "it" will play with me. They are asking around, trying to get the low down. Trying to find a piece of juicy gossip where it doesn't exist. "What's Alison doing? Who is she seeing? Who is she interested in?" Well, wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say it's definitely not you that I am interested in. I can't do that again.

      This weekend I came to a realization of sorts.  I have always been impressed with people who can be self-diciplined but unfortunately, I have never been one of those people.  I have also always been disturbed when I think about how the food I usually eat gets from the farm to my table.  So...I have been thinking for  a while (a few years) about falling into the devils other playground of Veganism.   Last week I completely ran out of food so I went to Wild Oats this weekend and shopped with all the other hippie wierdos. I bought only vegan foods, well except for some salmon.  I can't go completely vegan all at once I will for sure fall off the wagon and probably would get sick.  So I won't give up  fish quite yet. But no beef, chicken, pork, milk, egg, or cheese products though.  So really it is more of a vegetarian diet with fish.  I know, I know, poor fish.  It will take a while to get used to eating better, healthier etc...but I definitely believe in what it stands for and I am gonna freakin do it.      This too will help me concentrate on me for a bit.  I have never really figured myself out or lived for a cause all my own and now with this I can.   I can hopefully live and eat healthier. It will help my broken heart mend back together because I will have something else to concentrate on and work towards.  Since graduating from school there is no light at the end of the tunnel anymore because I have reached it.  There is no ultimate goal in my life, nothing to work for and slave away for except a paycheck.  I figure if I have this to concentrate on I will be doing my part to help the world and the cows and the chickens.  It will be something I can stand for.  It will be my personal cause. It will be my firm, but non-violent,  at home protest.

        Pieces of Dead     (April 4, 2003)      My hair is falling out  All over the bed are the pieces of red  And why?  I’m 22 with a million thoughts  But none of you  As I lie in this place  Lie to my self   Lie to your face  You speak of Jesus and religion  I speak of art and decision  You live in the imaginary  I live in reality  White and black   Is to day and night  As to you and I  So I sit and lie upon my bed  Amongst my fallen pieces of red  And to myself I lie  Wanting nothing better than to die  Another falls out   Falls down upon my bed and onto this book   I think it’s time I’ll take another look  Maybe at my life  Maybe at you and I  And warm now is this bed  Amongst my fallen pieces of dead

      So you came too. Even worse you came with "it".  My arch-enemy, the most hated person in my life. The most ugliest person I have ever met. The most horrible person of all time and you came with her.  You left early, you say you were sick. I say you were uncomfortable and annoyed that I wouldn't give you the time of day.  I say you got fed up with me moving on.  I haven't moved on, but I have to try.  It's the only semi-sane thing to do.  Maybe you were jealous because I was talking to someone else. Maybe you were upset that you didn't phase me but for a few days.  Maybe it's hard to see me move on because YOU CAN'T MOVE ON.      "So what's my secret?" you ask.  Well I don't live with you.  I don't hang on your every word. I don't jump when you say jump. I don't have to see you every day.  I don't sit and stare at you with googly eyes because you aren't here.  I don't think about you when I wake up anymore because I don't wake up NEXT TO YOU.  Proximity is the answer. Proximity has always been the answer.

      I am not a bitch, not at all. I am not assertive. I am not a go-getter. I never take initiative. I let the world walk all over me. I bend over backwards and forwards for everyone. I am too nice. I am too patient. I am too forgiving. I let everyone and everything fuck me over. This is my fault because I don't speak up, I don't say what's on my mind, I keep out of confrontation, I let others do it for me. My good friend and former professor is moving away to pursue other hopes and dreams outside of "Nashvile" as she calls it. She has left me with some advice and I believe it to be good advice. She told me "no offense, but you need to discover your inner-bitch". There is nothing wrong with having an inner bitch, it doesn't mean that you are all bitch, or that anyone will think you are a bitch. It is an inner-bitch and therefore, only the ones that try to fuck you over will see the wrath of the inner-bitch.     An inner-bitch is not something that you can buy at Wallgreens or take classes for, rather it is built into our soul. We all have it we just need to discover it. So my mission now will be to find my inner-bitch, as elusive as she may be, and start standing up for myself. As I get to know my inner-bitch I may not be quite myself, so please forgive me if I tear your head off as my inner-bitch and I will likely have some growing pains to get through.

      I am sooo tired today.  It's not like I was even out that late last night.  I went to the Springwater, yes the most white trash, hole in the wall of a bar in Nashville.   I also have a beer headache from my 2 shitty Michelob Ultras. But at least it's thursday and I get my hair cut and colored tomorrow.   My boss called today around noon to tell me he was going to be in  a lunch meeting.  I then took the liberty to layeth my head on my desk and sleep for around 20 minutes.  Then this guy I met on the elevator thought he would pay me a visit while he was walking the company dog around the building.  Really just an excuse to come flirt with the  strange haired, punkish girl in a t-shirt and jeans,  who works on the 4th floor and was dumb enough to actually tell him where she works.   Right in the middle of my damn nap!  Who does he think he is?  Why does every guy in Cummins Station stalk me?     My parents come in exactly one week! I am not freaked out or anything. I haven't made a to do list or a list of things to hide before they arrive.  I also haven't made those alphabetized lists in Excel either.    Tonite or sometime this week  I was supposed to have a date.  But luck has it,  the person I was supposed to go with had a friend that died and I am pretty sure there is no date this week.      All my friends are moving away and they should stop. I am back down to 3 friends.      I have plans to go to an invite only night club opening. But I don't want to go.  I think I will fake sick.  Better yet I think I  will fake dead.

      Do I look like a thug? Do I look like a snoop? Do I look like I have nothing better to do than walk around my office suite trying to find unlocked doors?  Apparently to some nitwit, pompass, ass, cocks I do. You see, this guy, not much older than I, who works somewhere in my suite, for his mom, who I have met on occasion was meeting with some other schmuck in the conference room next door to my office.  He confronted me after I went to the restroom and asked point blank,  "Why were you trying to get into that office earlier?"   I said well "I wasn't"    He said "No, I saw you (made a forceful hand motion on the door handle) do this, seems like you were trying to get in..."    I said "I have been in that office all day long with the exception of going to the bathroom just now."   He then said in his pathetic defense "Then someone who looked just like you was trying to get in there."   I said "Maybe so, but it wasn't me."    It pissed me off so bad I wanted to curse him out right there.  Fuckin piece of shit asshole!

      It's tuesday, just as lame as monday but with a different name.  I have no exciting stories, just same old bagel and lemonade for breakfast.    We are still at war for no reason.  And I still hate my motherfucking job.   I will say that a guy from my building I smoke with quite often  asked me out last week.  He is much older than I and well, obviously doesn't pick up on the butchy dyke vibe I apparently to some fuckers put out so flagrantly.  HA, told you I didn't DEVIL BITCH!  Even my good friend Bethany who has the most perceptive Gaydar of all didn't quite know.  So alas, I am not as queer as a football bat.

      Happy fucking monday. So far I have done nothing today as usual. I am babysitting a printer as it spits out little,  cards. All I have to do is make sure it keeps printing. Sometimes it fucks up and quits and I have to rub it's nose and tell it to keep going and that we have to finish. But most of the time he does his job and gets me home from this hell hole on time.     I am still heartbroken, but happy because I got a call from someone else over the weekend who wants to "do something" this week. It's amazing how that always happens at the right times. Not sure how I feel about this person, but it's time to move on. Right? Even if nothing happens, even if I don't get another call. At least it makes me happy for now.    More art therapy sessions. I painted on my porch last night, but I didn't get drunk this time. I still like what I made though, and this time I didn't leave it outside to dry and warp to shit. So anyways it is monday and life is getting better, sort of. I still, however, feel dirty from going out this weekend and the bachelorette events that unfolded.

      Sundays are depressing.  I hate them and always have.  Even as a kid I would cry all day on sundays.  Maybe then because I knew I would have to go back to school the next day and be turned again to the ridicule of my classmates.  So I spent my blue sunday basquing in the sun, nursing a slight hangover, listening to sad songs on my ipod trying not to think of the one I have lost.  I also took a few naps and then tonight made a painting or two out on my sad little porch. So that's it just a sad sunday and back to work tomorrow.

      Jackson had his manhood stolen from him, but he will be a much better puppy for it.  I'm sorry Jackson.  Tonite I have to go to a slanky bachelorette party at a hotel where there will be a sex toy sales lady selling stuff.  We  are all going to get super shit faced and I will get super stupid and I hope I don't fall into the Jell-O Shot trap of saying things I shouldn't say outloud.  I don't know what to wear, I don't know what to bring, I am not sure where this party is partaking. Anyways should be quite an adventure.  Gotta head off to shop soon.     Here's a little limerick I made up over a Gin and Tonic at the Lounge on thursday. It's for when I go out and I am afraid of running in to her:    Will she show up?  Maybe she will...  Maybe she won't...  If she does...  JUST SAY DON'T!

      My boss is the most moronic retard I have ever seen in my life. I can't even begin to explain how stupid this job is and how I run the whole god damned company.     FOR EXAMPLE:    He asked me  alternative to the delete key and was astounded when I said "backspace"    He runs a printing business and doesn't know the difference between a jpeg and a vector illustration.    He runs a printing business and thinks everything is printed in a pantone color (i have yet to see one can of pantone ink ever set foot in this office)  To wake up the computer from the screen saver he pounds on the space bar 50 times  He thinks that everytime the comupter pauses to think that it froze up on him and he freaks out  He smokes in the office and is convinced that if he sits in a certain area that no one can smell it, however I can smell it 50 feet away, outside of the office, as soon as the elavator door opens  He calls every morning around 10:30 to say he's on his way and that his stomach has been "acting up" when he finally arrives 2 hours later he reeks of alchohol likely from the previous night of lonely binging and the stomach bug is just part of the hangover  Called one time to tell me he was trying to outrun a cop  He talks in a british accent when he has been drinking (unfortunately ran into him at an art show)  He fires anyone that can't sort through his fucked up accounting (so i stay out of it and refuse to touch any of the bills, invoices or money)  His CPA calls everyday trying to find tax forms that he lost and/or never filed, then he gets pissed off at the IRS because he owes them money  He looks at porn on my computer and probably jacks off at my desk   He chases young girls in the building and asks them out all the time  Thus and therefore I will only be seen wearing a t-shirt and jeans at the office, I'll be damned if I let him see in anything less  He only hires women, doesn't trust men and says it's too much of an ego competition  He has made passes at his employees before, but there is a law firm just upstairs and I think he knows I'll be paying them a visit if he ever thinks about making a comment to me  If he can't find a client's file, he makes a new one  He has never delivered a job on time or as promised to a client  He thinks he knows everyone of any importance in town  He thinks that just because we printed (some famous musician who shall remain nameless) card that they are buddies  He calls himself a professional photographer because he takes pictures of people for their ID cards with a circa 1997 Kodak 2.0 megapixel digital camera   Every law office this side of the Mississippi is after him because he won't pay his bills  He writes illegible emails because he has the english skills of a Post-It Note  He has me file his personal creditcard statements, which include about 10+ cards and mostly charges his tabs at the titty bars to them  He doesn't get here until noon most of the time then goes to lunch at 1 then fucks around till 3 then comes back here bullshits his clients and vendors then goes and plays golf  His checks bounce   He payed me once or twice on time  He is scared of gay people and black people  He has been married and divorced 3 TIMES!  His son can't stand him  I can't stand him   and HE  SUCKS!!!     I HATE MY FUCKING JOB!!! I HATE MY FUCKING BOSS!!!

      It is tusday July 13 and unfortunately 13 is my unluckiest of unlucky numbers. The ever so fabulous Brooke and I decide to cheer my broken little heart up with some ceremonial, get over that girl sushi. We go down to Hillsboro Villiage to Taste of Tokyo, not the best, but cheap. I arrived shortly there after 8 pm and began to chug a pint of Sapporo while I waited for the fashionably late Brooke to join me. She arrived finally after I had to sit there and sulk alone in that tiny little restraunt whilst the Vandy Candy stared at the lonely raggety girl in the corner named Alison. We had a good time though chatting and convincing me about how I am better off now and how I should move on and how I am going to get better soon and all that cheer up bullshit.   Just about finished we were planning to head over to our favorite East Nashville neigborhood bar, The Lipstick Lounge and meet our friends Christy and Brenda Lee for some drinks and free pool. But Brookes Dad called to give us warning of a storm that was heading straight for us. Apparently there were to be seriously damaging winds, lightning and big fuckin hail. The weather nut that I am think to myself "maybe today is the day I will see my first tornado". I figured it was very calm outside, still warm, very still and I don't hear any thunder so we have plenty of time. We start to head across town to the lounge, but Mother Nature had different plans for us.   Five minutes later we were on our phones with each other trying to figure out how best to get there. All of a sudden the stop lights and street lights started to flicker and go out. The transformers and power lines were exploding raining green sparks onto the warm summer pavement. The lightning was still far off in the distance, so I didn't understand what all the ruckus was about. Then I saw the branches and trash blow all over the road. The 60 mph straight line winds had offically arrived. YEEEE HAAWWWW!!! Actually, as exciting as it was, I was super freaked out. I decided to forego the interstate and headed through a neigborhood. Great idea i had to dodge tons of debris like trash cans, trash, people, trees and pieces of trees. I tell Brooke that we need to go somewhere safe and decide that we should put our tuition money to good use. We head for the underground parking garage at our alma mater, which we had just passed. I meet her there on the second floor of our concrete bunker, we get out and examine our babies and all is good. No dents, no scratches just dusty.   After our quick debriefing we call our friends at the bar and tell them we won't be making it anytime soon. They say that's ok because they are all huddled in the basement with no power and a tree fell on a car in the parking lot. Then thanking our lucky stars our babies were ok we bravely walk up to the ground floor to watch for tornadoes and such. My beer has now passed offically to my bladder, I gotta go. So we run against the winds into the big atrium of the Curb Events Center made of glass. Bad idea I know, but when you gotta pee you gotta pee. So we pee and run back outside through the wind and back under the parking lot. The lightning was incredible and the rain went sideways and the wind was so strong we thought we were in the twister movie. I have never seen anything like this. But it all passed through pretty quickly, hence it's intensity. We didn't make it over to the bar and they never got power back. Instead we just went home, watched the news, and went to bed.

      You don't see this See me deal with this Lying on the ground Face down in paint and blood What did you do when you left? Where did you go? What are you thinking? What are you doing right now? Thinking of how you continually break me? Hurt me? Throw me down? Into this fire I'm faling Crying, waiting, hoping you will come back But this time it feels more permanent The last time we try This time I'll die You used me and spit me out Spit what lost it's taste But I wish I could be Be yours and only yours I sucumb now to what was and never now will be

      For so long everything I have written has been locked deep away in a closet for no one else to read. I was going to add my writings and art as an extention to my website, however that takes time and energy which I don't have right now.  I've done gone and gotten my heart broke and have been writing and painting my sad little ass off. So boo hoo for me. This is what I wrote when she walked away.  The grey clouds are about to turn Turn to pink and then to red And to the color of my bleeding heart You walked away again today Now I'm the one lying, crying drunk in sadness Drunk on my floor, my solemn porch I can't be mad, but wish I could It would be easier  But it's too hard to be angry  Angry and in love  You walked away, I stood silent Nothing to say it was coming Denial is a dangerous game Though I was just card in yours to play So I cut myself in the long past years  But tonight I bleed for you Will you cut yourself too? The color of the sky now runs down my arm For you forever my heart will too

      This is not the best song in the world and I certainly don't listen to country, however the lyrics are very pertinent.  These Days -Rascal Flats   Hey baby is that you Wow your hair got so long Yea yea I love it, I really do Norma-Jean ain't that the song we'd sing in the car Driving down town, top down making the rounds Checking out the bands on Doeheenie Avenue  Yea life throws you curves But you learn to swerve Me I swung and I missed and the next thing you know I'm reminiscing dreaming old dreams wishing old wishes Like you would be back again  I wake up and tear drops they fall down like rain I put on that old song that we danced to and then I head off to my job guess not much has changed Punch the clock, head for home, check my phone, just in case Go to bed, dream of you, that's what I'm doing these days Yea that's what I'm doing  Some one told me after college You ran off to Vegas And married a rodeo cowboy, Wow, That ain't the girl I knew Me I been a few places Mostly here and there, once or twice Still sorting out life but I'm doing all right Yea it's good to see you too Well hey girl your late And those planes they don't wait But if you ever come back around this sleepy old town Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend and until then...  I wake up and tear drops they fall down like rain I put on that old song that we danced to and then I head off to my job guess not much has changed Punch the clock, head for home, check my phone, just in case Go to bed, dream of you, that's what I'm doing these  I wake up and tear drops they fall down like rain I put on that old song that we danced to and then

      I had an interview in Jackson Tennessee on tuesday.  They want me back tomorrow for a second interview with more other people I didn't meet the first time.  Jackson is 2 hours west of Nashville so that equates to 4 hours of driving tomorrow.  Do I really want to live in Jackson? Do I really want to move there? If they offer me a job hell yeah I do.  It wouldn't be forever. Nothing is forever. Oh, except the blessed imaginary love of Jesus and the invisible kingdom of heaven.  Too bad I am a dirty heathen. Mwwwwahahahahaha.

      Yesterday, sunday, I was bored again as fuck.  So I decided after watching a documentary about surfing to drive around and take pics.  I ended up all they way in west Tennessee.  Benton County to be precise.  I took pictures in 4 or 5 small towns and crossed the Tennessee river. Then came home around 6 pm.  I was way, way, way far from home. About 120 miles.  It was awsome I haven't gone out and taken pictures for months.  Tomorrow I go to Jackson TN for an interview. I don't want to work in Jackson or live in Jackson, so unless they offer me like 50k I won't be going anywhere. My birthday is soon.  Next thursday.  Saturday night was fun.  I didn't n make an ass of myself at the Cabaret, got free cigarettes,  I had a great hair day, and I think someone wants me back. TOO FUCKIN BAD!

      I go in hopes of moving on.  Distraction is my guide.  Yet still you show up.  I know you came with a purpose, to snoop and to pry.  Maybe with hopes of winning me back.  My heart leapt when you walked in, but the anxiety was only fleeting.  I saw you across the bar and I contemplated my feelings, but there were none.  I felt nothing. I saw nothing, nothing like I had seen before.  I felt nothing.  But finally someone else.

      Well the parents have left and gone home.  It's back to my crazy double life.  I get to be myself again now for the next 17 days until I go home to visit them.  Then back into my dormant and oh so lonely closet for the 8 days I will be at home.  It's exhausting trying to be these 2 different people.  I fell asleep last night at 8 pm.
