      It has been a long weekend. Yesterday, I was feeling like I was getting the flu. Achy muscles, tiredness, didn't feel like eating.   I guess, the week was a little too exciting with all that construction. My lupus has decided to flare up. Yuck, on a Holiday weekend too.   I took to my bed.  Slept a couple of hours, played the new dvd, Lord of the Rings. Slept a little more, played a video game (I am addicted to Animal Crossing), Went to bed. I slept the night (approx 9hrs). I got up, let the dogs out, fed my parakeet, Let the dogs in, and Ladysarajane and I went back to bed. Slept 5 more hours.   Now I feel a little better. The achiness is not as bed. Still have to take it easy though. Luckily I have an appointment next week with my Rheumatologist. He'll take blood to see if any vital organs have been targeted again.   Unfortunately, I don't think I can just totally kick back and relax. Nasty weather is approching. Tornado warnings to our west, heading this way. Hopefully they will weakened before they reach my area.....I hope....

      Finally it is Friday. It has been a busy week. Last night storms threatened the area. In fact a tornado touched down to the east of town. Luckily no one was injured.   My favorite channel Techtv is gone. It has merged with G4. In my opinion it is now a channel geared for teens to very young adults. I will miss the the tech fix I used to get from Leo Laporte on Call for Help. Now it is gone. Even the Tech Tv web site is totally gone. At least  urlLink Leoville Town Square  is very active and able to still give me my tech fix. Thank you Leo for keeping the Town Square going!  On to other things.   Ladysarajane loves the cicada's. She has fun chasing them. Me, I cannot wait till they are gone. They are so loud!. One got in the house and my cat, Charlie had fun playing with it. Everytime he but his paw on it, it started buzzing. He had so much fun. We finally caught it and released it outside.   Construction has moved along. They poured concrete for the sidewalks. Unfortunately they didn't warn us and I found out I was unable to get out of my driveway. They will put the plating over the sidewalk later this afternoon, but I am stuck until then. So much for common sense and dispersal of information. It is a good thing I don't have an "emergency". I still have a wondering question, though. I didn't think they were going to pour the sidewalks over the driveways for a simple reason, How are they going to connect the feeder lines to the new pipe? Redig for it? I guess that will be answered in time.     urlLink    Placing the metal ramps over the new concrete driveways   Life Moves On.......

      Wednesday the 26th. Are we sure it is not  Friday the 13th ?  I was awakened at 7:45am to frantic knocking on my front door. Ladysarajane just looked at me from her bed on the floor.  I scrambled into my robe and houseslippers, as I get nearer the front door, I see that the construction people are already busy in the front.  I opened the front door and the construction foreman was there. It was not good news. They hit our water feeder line.(the line that goes from the water main to our house)   NO WATER SERVICE   I can't even drive anywhere! The feeder line is between the driveway and driveway apron, so they cannot place the temporary plating over gap, until the line is repaired.   I can't even make a pot of coffee! This disaster would have been minor, if I had a cup of coffee. My next door neighbor came to me as I was surveying the damage at the bottom of my driveway.(Yes, I had gone back in to quickly get dress before going outside)He wanted my coffee pot so he could fill it with water. Bless, the man! I had my coffee. I got a lawn chair. I had a cup of coffee in my had, so I sat down to watch the work.   urlLink    Construction in my yard Wednesday the 26th. Are we sure it is not  Friday the 13th ?    Uh, Oh....no the foreman is coming to me again. They cannot repair the feeder line until the water is turned off from the main....they have to wait to the Water Works worker comes with the special tool to turn it off. Est time of arrival....1hr...we hope.   Meanwhile the pipefitter prepares for it, by getting another pipe ready to go. That's good. Constuction work continues on. They lay the new main one pipe at a time. New fire hydrant going in our front yard. Well, it has to go somewhere and since the old fire hydrant is across the street, it makes sense it is in our yard.   An hour as gone by and still no Water worker. Another diaster, sticks, when laying the pipe the digger that is swinging the pipes around, hits our mailbox with the back of the digger.......Ah... guys......look what happen to my mailbox!!!!  They took a mallet to the crossbar. It looks better, but I can't really get down it to see the damage. I got sidetracked cause the water man arrived. After a couple of minor leaks after turning on the water, it finally was turned on around 11:30am. But bad news for my neighbor. It turns out his feeder line is leaking and apparently has been leaking for a while. But he was lucky, he got a chance to fill jugs etc before his water was turned off for repair. They had to dig more in his front lawn, to get to the leak. We are hoping that his large tree survives the insult to it's roots.   Ladysarajane and I go back to bed for a nap. That is all the excitement we can take for  today.

      Today was not a good day. Ladysarajane and I are feeling the heat. Sun has been out strong the last few days and intense. We both have been feeling blah! Not sick, sick. Just very tired with no appetite, slight fevers and increase generalized aches and pains.   I resorted to playing on my computer with periods of laying down, watching TV and Ladysarajane makes herself comfortable on my bed. She is the only dog, that takes over my bed.   Then the bad news slowly developed. They are going to tear up our street tomorrow to replace water lines. It is all ready to go. A few tons of sand dumped in the street in front of our house. Orange construction signs posted. Cones up along the street with no parking signs taped to them. Huge pipes in the yard across the street. Large flood lights on a golf cart thingy! And.....the  diggers. Two large ones sitting like monsters on the street. This can only mean.........No water sometime tomorrow with difficulty getting off and on the street. Not to mention my driveway.   I decided a trip to the store was necessary, to get everything I might need for the next couple of days. Went to the store after the sun went down. At least it is cooler than Sunday night. My brother came along with me. I was almost done with shopping and it started. By it, I mean a episode of double/blurred vision. No warning. Just started to seem like my eyes were getting to feel, like they are crossing. It was so bad, I had to close them, because the picture was so crazy, I was getting nauseated. Luckily a mini restaurant in the grocery story was nearby and I sat at one of the tables. They were closed for they evening, so my brother went and bought a can of coke for me. Episode lasted less than 2mins. This is the 2nd episode in four months...... Hopefully it was just triggered by increasing heat/sun exposure.   Lupus mimics other diease symptoms, but those disease can also be responsible for symptoms that are not from the Lupus. I have a tendency to blame all my symptoms on Lupus, but I have other health problems that are independent of the Lupus. It is just easier to say your back hurts from the Lupus, but actually I have Scoliosis(curvature of the spine). My curve is in the lumbar area(the lower back). X-rays did not do my back justice. They show the moderate curve, but not the degeneration with it. I had to have a MRI because I was having severe back pain, to the point, I could not walk or sleep. I was working at the time and my job involved a lot of walking. The MRI showed severe degeneration at the level of the curve. So, a lot of my back pain is from my Scoliosis, not the Lupus.   Writing this is getting me tired again. I guess I should call it a night. Those diggers are supposed to be up,  bright and early at 7:20 am. That's what the 'No Parking' sign said!  Good Night to all.

      Hello everyone!  So I finally did it and made a Blog. Ladysarajane is impressed. She is warming my feet underneath my computer desk, as I type this.   As summer approaches, Ladysarajane and I are getting braced for it. Summer tends to be our worse months for our Lupus. She hates the sunscreen and I hate having to reapply it on her every 5 minutes.  For people unfamiliar with Lupus, it is an autoimmune diease, that is made worse by ultraviolet light. That includes sunlight, and fluorescent light. It has a different course in each person that has it. Diagnosis can be difficult. Ladysarajane was lucky, her's was diagnosed by the time she was 5 months. For myself, the doctor believes I had it as a teen and it wasn't diagnosed until I was 32. By that time, the accumulative damage was starting to show.   So 10 yrs later, now that I am on disability, I have decided to write about our journey together, so others can understand how someone that looks healthy may actually be fighting  a chronic illness. Hopefully some questions will be answered about the diease as I describe what happens to us day to day.   I think that is enough for tonight, I am writing a journal, not a book!

      Wednesday June 23.  June Twenty-third? Already? What happened to the beginning of June?  Ladysarajane and I made it to today with the minimum of illnesses. Not so for the rest of the family! Ladysarajane's brother, Sir Jake Poohbear(Jakie for short) has been under the weather. He scared me, when he would not eat a "cookie". Rushed him to the vet. He was a sick doggy. Apparently he had a "stomach infection". He hates the loud sounds of "fireworks", and in my area, they have started early. Our theory is that his anxiety, left his stomach open to infection. Within the first two hours of receiving the antibiotic, he improved. He is also now on Valium for his anxiety. My poor big brave dog needs valium! Being sick has its benefits.....I have slaved over the stove, boiling chicken and making rice for his meals! He totally loves it!  Construction proceeds on our street. Luckily up around the bend. I can sleep in the morning without hearing the construction going on.   I just hope the rest of Summer goes as fast as the first part of June has.

       urlLink      Owen Matthew, born July 12, 2004       &nbsp;     &nbsp;  This month has been a roller coaster.&nbsp; Sarajane and I have not been feeling well.&nbsp;   The&nbsp;birth of our Nephew has helped some.&nbsp; He arrived July 12, 2004 at 12:36 pm.&nbsp; He weighed 8lbs 60z and was 20 1/4 inches long.     &nbsp;  He was doing fine until 4hours after birth and he developed Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It is usually only seen in Premature Infants.&nbsp; It is a condition where the babies lungs do not produce the chemical called "surfactant".&nbsp; The chemical helps the lungs to open when taking a breath. He is &nbsp;in&nbsp; the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. The first 48hous were rough&nbsp;&nbsp;but now&nbsp;the prognosis is good. Hopefully he will be coming home late next week.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
