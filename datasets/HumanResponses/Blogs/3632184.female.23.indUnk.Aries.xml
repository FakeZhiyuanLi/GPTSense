      I can't wait until Saturday! I've got the food all planned out and I can't wait to make it and enjoy it - even though I'll only be able to eat little bits of it at a time =(   Oh, and Friday is a casual day, so that's always exciting!  And this morning my scale said 245, which means I'm 15 lbs. down post-surgery. Too bad it took me 6 frigging months to get there. This damn band is worthless. According to Fitday.com, my daily intake is waaaay lower than the calories I burn just by existing, but still I'm not losing. The hell? I've given up trying to figure out my body. I'm just glad I've finally lost a couple pounds. The big plan is to make some mini-goals for myself. Namely, I will try to lose 5lbs every 3 weeks. It's not much, but at that rate, I can be at my goal weight by a year from August. 14 months seems like such a long time, but I'm finally realizing that it's not so long compared to the 12 YEARS that I've been overweight and actively trying to lose weight. Maybe slow but sure has been the answer all along. It's still difficult to go that route, though, because I need the instant gratification of losing a lot of weight really quickly. My junior year of undergrad I busted my ass and lost like 40 lbs. in a semester, but what happened? I gained it all right back the minute I let a piece of bread slip past my lips.  Maybe this time around, instead of rewarding my weight loss with food (how counter-intuitive is that?!), I'll reward myself with a new book, or the pedicure I desperately need. Isn't that a novel idea? =)

      Last night about 10pm I realized that I have that appointment with my personal trainer this evening. It's irking me that I made the appointment for 6.30pm instead of either earlier or later. Particularly since, after finishing  urlLink Elegance   last night, I've decided it's high time I buy some proper, matching, pants and bras for myself. The ill-fitting pants I usually wear are always riding up (really, more like riding down =) under my trousers and it's totally disgraceful. So I have to rush over to Lane Bryant after work, because today is the last day for their lingerie sale, frantically spend too much money on lingerie, then rush home to let the dog out and change into appropriate working-out attire, then rush to the gym for my appointment with the trainer. Horror!   I can't wait to get on the scale at the gym, though, because I think my home scale is definitely acting up. According to it, I've lost another 10lbs...I don't trust the damn thing....

      After missing Andy's call 3 or 4 times yesterday, I finally got to talk to him. But it still wasn't enough. I miss just shooting the shit with him and always having him around. I'm having a really hard time with this not being able to call him thing.  The puppy made it through his surgery just fine. He was totally groggy from the anesthesia last night and I could tell he just felt miserable. He even crawled into his crate of his own volition and just nodded off. Normally I have to literally shove him into that crate. It would have been cute if I hadn't felt so sad for him.  So far today I have eaten some green pepper slices dipped in ranch dressing. But I keep thinking about those swiss cake rolls in the cupboard at home. It's a sickness, really. I should just throw them away. I mean, the box cost 88 cents. I've already eaten 3 of the 6 packs. I think I can afford to throw out 44 cents worth of food. But still they sit there, silently mocking me from afar. Damn you, little Debbie! You're on my list, bitch.  I got on the scale this morning with my shoes and all my clothes on, just out of curiosity. I was surprised to see that I had lost 1 or 2 lbs. since last week. But I don't trust my sneaky scale. We'll wait and see what the fancy one at the gym says. Oh god! What if that trainer guy wants to weigh me and measure my fat and stuff?!  My sister is coming to visit today, yay! And then my mom is coming tomorrow, double yay! I can't wait to get the house all cleaned and everything in order.

      You have to read  urlLink this . I want to find the end of my rope and lose the cow. I've known for some time now that being heavy serves me in some way: I just haven't exactly figured out how yet. Reading this entry got me just a little closer to finding out how. Always nagging at the back of my mind is the feeling that I'm completely unoriginal, totally uninteresting, I have no worthwhile hobbies, not much to offer anybody. Reading that entry I realized just how much my identity is linked to being heavy. It's just what I've always been. Instead of being Shana it's always something like, "I'm just like my sister except 100lbs heavier." What the hell is that? Yes, if I lost 100lbs I would weigh the same as my sister and the resemblance would indeed be striking. We smile the same way, we laugh the same way, we get bitchy the same way. But aside from mannerisms and a strong family resemblance, we're two totally different people. Our personalities and life goals are astoundingly separate.  So I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Shana. I'm a good friend, I'm a good girlfriend, I'm a good mom to my puppy dog. I like to cook, I like to read, and I have been known to crochet. It's lame, but at least it's a start.

      I was sitting on my ass last night, thinking about how I really should plan on getting up early this morning to go workout. Then I realized there was pretty much no chance I would actually drag myself out of bed at 5.30am, even if there is a damn sauna in the locker room. In a flash of brilliance, I decided to just go workout right then instead of waiting for today when I would make up another excuse. So I did! I didn't stay long, but it was better than nothing. I chatted with some fun guys about Chappelle's Show, it was fun.  Today I decided I was going to take advantage of my membership and set up a time for one of my free personal trainer sessions. So I'm all set for Monday at 6.30pm, yippie!  Whenever I decide to start an exercise program it always starts so well...let's hope this time I can keep it going...

      I finally met  urlLink bwil  and  urlLink galactic hero  today and they're awesome. In fact, they're so cool that they're naw-some (you'll have to ask Sansabelt or Snicker puppy about the nawsomes). We got to play at Impression 5 and see a puppet show and meet some awesome dudes who bike accross the county and do puppet shows to raise money and awareness about kids with disabilities. Meeting some nice new people and seeing a room full of attractive men in biking shorts, who could ask for a better day?  Oh, but it does get better! We're going to see The Village tonight, yay!  The Village was really good. Actually a lot better than I expected. And Ron Howard's daughter is surprisingly hot...  Afterwards we went back to the Sansabelt/bwil residence and watched Haiku Tunnel and I drank a tasty orange slushee, mmm!

      Anybody want to go listen to some  urlLink jazz  with me next weekend?   Today at work I was asked to change my shirt because there was "concern over the tightness of it and the dip in the neckline." Well, I felt like a total ass. Let's face it: I have some big ole ta-tas. Pretty much any shirt I put on is going to be a little snug over them, particularly button-down style shirts (which is what I was wearing today). I wasn't exactly running around in my bra for goodness sake - in fact, you couldn't even see down the shirt far enough to see my tasteful bra unless you stood directly over me and purposely stared down into my shirt. Whatever. Somebody is obviously just jealous of my bodacious boobies.  Snickers did really well at puppy class last night, even though we hadn't done our homework! And Pudge's owner brought his son, which was kinda a surprise, but he was a little cutie!  I went to workout after puppy class last night and there was this guy there. I've seen him at the gym before and I think he's kinda cute. He's tall and dark-haired, and not traditionally good-looking, but he's handsome in an offbeat kinda way and he sort of sings to himself when he's on the treadmill listening to music and it's just really endearing. Plus he wears glasses, and I just love men in glasses (unless it's a pair of oversized 80's style honkers). And he wasn't wearing a wedding ring... I wasn't going to go workout tonight, but now I kinda want to to see if he's there again ;) I'm such a dork.   If Mr. Sansabelt's new shed-ule allows, I'm dragging him to Moriarty's next Tuesday. Unless I chicken out and decide not to go. Bars scare me.

      I know this is totally dorky, but I'm mega-excited about the appointment&nbsp;I made with a dentist here in Lansing. He's actually accross the parking lot from my work. He specializes in jaw and grinding type problems, so maybe I'll actually get some help so my jaw will stop popping and I'll stop clenching and grinding my teeth. And I think I'm going to ask him about dental bonding - my teeth are so dingy-looking because the enamel on my teeth is so thin. I want gorgeous, shiny white teeth, damnitt! But only if my insurance will pay part of it =)  I don't know what I'm going to do when I can't be on my dad's insurance anymore. They are awesome sauce. They paid for my whole frigging lap-band surgery, every last cent. Even people whose surgeries were covered often have to pay for their fill visits and such, but I don't even have to pay for those. I am one lucky little sheila.  When I first got the band I kinda regretted it, because it wasn't working. But then when my most recent fill kicked in it was like BAM! Restriction! I mean, I ordered carry-out from P.F. Chang's yesterday because I was really craving it, and I even got the lunch portion, and there's still about 3/4 of it left in my fridge, even though I ate some of it for lunch, dinner, and a snack. How crazy is that? Before, I would've eaten the dinner-sized portion and probably still have gone in search of something else to eat. I had all these bags of chips in my freezer from the 4th of July party and I threw them all out the other day. There had to have been at least 5 or 6 different bags in there. We're talking the tasty stuff, too. My 2 favourite kinds of Doritos, 3 favourite kinds of Lay's, and some tortilla chips. I just knew that I'd never be able to eat more than like 3 chips at a time so they'd be taking up freezer space forever. Bye-bye chippies!  My band is my new best friend. It's still kinda hard for me to just throw out the food or put it in the fridge when I obviously can't finish it, but it's getting a little bit easier every day. And I never feel deprived. I have ice cream probably 2 or 3 times per week but I'm still losing weight because I can't eat a whole sloppy bowl of it at a time.  Ok, on a less happy note - tonight is puppy class and...well...Snickers and I didn't  exactly  do our homework this week...I just know the trainer lady is going to know it too. I'm totally in trouble...

      Shad and I (well really, he did all the work) are attempting to make our very own origami Lambuel! That website has everything, man...  And also: I had bought a pair of size 20 jeans @ LB and after wearing them twice I realized they're just too big. So I exchanged them for a pair of 18's. Size 18, oh yeah! Nevermind that there was a time when a size 14 jeans from LB was too big on me...I'll get there soon enough, damnitt!  Ouch. My sunburn really hurts.  C.W. has incurred my wrath. From 2 to 3 am all I heard was her and some dude dragging heavy shit across the floor directly above my head, clomping up and down the stairs directly outside my window repeatedly, and driving away for a few minutes before coming back to repeat the whole act. If she's moving some dude in with her, so help me...

      I went to my first-ever Lansing Lugnuts game yesterday with Shad and Joe and Beth. We did, indeed, go nuts! =) No really, it was totally fun. I just wish I had had the foresight to slather on a little of the ole sunscreen. It was a fantastic day, but all the happy sun made my already sunburned shoulders and face not so happy. Today I'm looking lobster-rific, but it was worth it. My favourite part was watching the purple dino-looking 'big lug' dance his gangsta dance. He was awesome. And they launched hotdogs and t-shirts and it was crazy! I will definitely go again.&nbsp;They even sell margaritas there! Ridiculous!

      I just got home from a night at mom's with Drew. We had a ton of fun (though I got maybe a bit too drunk and did a couple ill-advised things...) I colored my hair back to natural from the blonde. It was so good to see mom and Nic and Bernice and Dad and Diane. I've been feeling really good lately, very strong in my outlook about the Andy situation. I thought I had made a pretty good start on the road to recovery. And then, back here at the homestead, the phone rang and it was somebody asking for Andy. I didn't know who it was at first (turns out it was Nick), but it totally threw me. I just didn't know what to say. And then Nick mentioned that he saw Andy last night in Port Huron, which just threw me even more. Andy and I were in the same city last night and he didn't think to call or anything? I know he had no way of knowing whether I was at my mom's or not, but it's pretty conceivable that I might be there, and I thought he would've called regardless because when we talked on Monday he assured me he would. So I called him just now and we talked and things are pretty ok, but I cried of course and I'm just feeling really depressed and wanting my heart to stop aching this instant. He pierced both his ears tonight...I'm not really sure what to think about that...and he's going to be living in Owen in the fall, which is...interesting to say the least. Gah. At least I've managed to stop crying momentarily. I need ice cream

      Mr. Doodle puppy is here at work with me right now. He's laying outside in the shade happily chewing a Greenie. Good puppy! I'm leaving right from work (well, when Drew gets here, that is) to go to my mom's for the night. We're gonna have a cookout and a bonfire and I can't wait!  Hopefully tomorrow I'll get to hang out with Mr. Sansabelt (that means steer clear of golfing injuries and avoid getting too wasted tonight! =).  My sister even has tomorrow off, so I'll get to hang with her during the day. I'm hoping it's nice out so we can lay by the pool and be lazy lushes.  I was so crazed at lunch time packing things for me and for Snickers that I didn't have time to eat lunch. Now I'm staaaaarving....

      I can't sleep; my brain won't shut of long enough for that to happen. I can't convince everything to line up long enough to sort through it.   The book I'm reading at the moment centers on a fat girl. But the thing that makes the fat girl in this book different from the fat girls in the chick lit I usually read is that she doesn't end up thin and beautiful and desired. This girl is fat the whole time, but she's already beautiful and desired. As a matter of fact, she's a real sex kitten. Part of me wants to love this character, to model myself after her, while another part is really pissed off. This character supposedly stands 5'3" (3" shorter than me) and weighs 260 lbs. (30 lbs. more than me - incidentally, the same weight I was at just prior to my surgery). I know for a fact that, even at my height, when I was at that weight, I could barely breathe when I tried to sleep on my side, a walk through the library was like a damn marathon, and I could barely fit in my mom's bathtub at home. Are all of those things embarrassing to admit? Damn straight they are. But it's the truth. And people need to hear it. Gals who weigh that much don't tend to be sex kittens. They tend to be morbidly obese. Even now, after 30 lbs. gone, I'm still regular obese. I constantly worry that people (particularly men, now that I'm single again) judge me by my weight. And it upsets me. But when I'm really truthful with myself, I discover that I do the same thing (and here's the part that's keeping me awake). I judge people constantly by their weight. Why? I'm not totally sure, but I'm trying to figure it out. Maybe it's because I'm fat. If I'm unhappy and unhealthy at 230 lbs., then I can only divine that someone weighing 330 lbs. is similarly unhappy and exponentially more unhealthy.   I found a photo tonight of Eric, one of my favourite people ever. It was of him before he lost a bunch of weight. If I looked at that photo side-by-side with a photo of how he looks now, without knowing his personality, I can honestly say I would be very attracted to thinner Eric, but not be attracted to heavier Eric. Of course, after talking to Eric for any longer than 30 seconds or hearing him sing, I'd be insane not to drag him into my bed at any weight. Does that make me an awful person? Probably. But I'm trying to be honest here. So why the snap judgments? I guess because I look at overweight people (including myself) and I see unhappiness, health problems, and all the emotional hurt behind it. Nobody thinks to herself, "Gee, I would  love  to schlepp around an extra 100 lbs.!"   I have to point something out: I'm talking about being discriminatory when it comes to whether or not I would date a man. I'm not talking about writing people off as friends because they're overweight. Because obviously, if that's the way things worked, nobody would want to be my friend because I'm fat. But when it comes to attraction...maybe it's just that part of me realizes that I have enough issues with my own weight without inviting a similarly afflicted man into a relationship with me. I don't know, and it's too late to figure it out tonight.   All I wanted to was to dream about kissing a handsome guy...I miss kissing terribly...oh, now I'm thinking about Eric...that's an entirely different post.

      I went and worked out for the first time in for-ev-er tonight. I did 20 freaking minutes on the elliptical, which is insanity for one just starting to workout again, but the dude next to me was doing like 30 minutes and I didn't want to seem like a pansy so I just kept trucking. On my way upstairs to stretch, I noticed that, from the side, I looked hot in the big mirrors. Now, I'm sure it was a combination of 1) the mirrors being across the room; 2) my outfit being black; and 3) some miraculous skinnifying mirrors. I don't care, it still made me happy. Rock!

       urlLink This  is one of my new favourite places.  I went shopping at LB on Monday after work. I spent more money than I had planned, but it was worth it for the gorgeous skirt suit I got. Size 16 jacket and 20 skirt. Today I am wearing a pretty, blue 14/16 top and a pair of 18 pants. I know these sizes may not sound impressive, but to me they're a big step. If only my ass would catch up with my upper body...  As much as I love LB clothes, I can't wait for the day when, once again, the tops are too big for me (the smallest they go is a 14) and I have to buy tops at a normal store. It's within reach, I can almost taste it! It'll probably be a while before I have to go to a normal store for pants (thanks to the aforementioned discrepancy between the sizes in my upper and lower body).  I'm like 2 lbs. shy of being down 30 since the surgery. I am so happy that I'm finally losing, yay!!!  Right now I'm trying to eat some broccoli and cauliflower and my throat is making that unattractive sound it makes when it doesn't want to let any food past the band. It's so embarrassing. I guess being morbidly obese is more embarrassing though, so I'll take it.  Tonight is puppy class night! I can't wait to see Pudge!!!!

      Andy finally called me. Thank God. I was starting to get really paranoid about the whole thing. It sounds like he's having kind of a rough time at camp right now. As much as I wish I could just stop caring, I can't. He's my best friend, whether we're together or not, and I wish I could be there for him. I miss hanging out with him. Maybe being his friend will be even better than being his girlfriend, in the long run. This way I can enjoy his company and not have to feel as though I'm responsible for managing his finances and his life at the same time. He said we can still hang out and go to the gym together and stuff. I hope he means it. I can't stand to lose my boyfriend and my best friend all in the same summer....

      I love having weekend plans! &nbsp; Tonight my sister and her friend Meghan are coming to town, and after their field hockey practice (yes, you heard me right - my sister is going to exercise of her own free will, the world must be ending!) we're going to go to Flushing to see Shan and Paul and their new little puppy dog =)&nbsp; Puppy puppy puppy puppy, I can't wait to see the little one and for Snickers to meet her. &nbsp; Saturday Drew's going to come over for some beverages and some Animal Crossing, and hopefully Mr. Shad will grace us with his presence. Japy's house must need some cleaning at this point... I just talked to Shad (yes I was making personal calls while at work) and laughed more than I have in days, that dude is so funny.  &nbsp; My aunt &amp; uncle (M&amp;M) are at my mom's this weekend. I wish I could be there to hang out with them and my mom and Al...it's boat weekend and everything! But at least I have fun things to do here. &nbsp; Snickers is doing good with his homework - he loves that food stuff that the trainer reccommended. It's like a massive log of beef jerky. He just gobbles up the little bits, it's so cute. I tried to have him sleep on my bed last night but he kept trying to eat the blankets so he had to go back in the kitchen =( &nbsp; It's FRIDAY!!!

      Last night was our first 'puppy socialization' class. Little Snickers made so many new puppy friends! I think my favourite was Pudge, the little English bulldog. He was so damn cute! When he sat down, all his pudgy skin folds collected at his tush. Ahhh! Pudge is the coolest! Pudge's owner was really nice too. Though I didn't get his name. I think Snickers's favourite was Bo, a big chocolate lab mix. Snickers thought he was hot shit and was trying to stand up to Bo, it was really funny. Bo's owner was really nice too, but I didn't get her name either =) And then there was Molly the St. Bernard, she was soooo soft and sweet! And there was a tiny, tiny Boston Terrier, and a couple golden retrievers, and a couple really big puppies. They were all so cute I thought I was going to die.  I bought Snickers a log of beefy stuff to use as his training treat, so I spent part of the night last night cutting it up into little tiny pieces. We even have 'homework' to do, it's awesome. I can't wait until next week's class!

      Ok, this was always one of my favourite movies. But now, watching it after a shitty breakup, it's even better. I can't resist a couple quotes:  "There are two things I always wanted to believe in...but didn't dare. One is that there is one man...somewhere...who was made just for me. The other is that I just...might...deserve him."  "I know. It's more of a curse than a blessing." "What is?" "Being smart...and what people call beautiful. I'm not bragging, but in my day I was considered quite a catch. I don't think I ever met a man I felt could outsmart me, outthink me. Those silly creatures did bore me. Oh, it does cause quite a fuss, that combination - smart and beautiful. But it's mostly in your own gut. See, the problem is you stop believing that he could be out there waiting for you." "Who?" "Your true love."  It's so hard to believe.

      Listen to her, she knows of what she speaks:  http://www.tomatonation.com/gocarbs.shtml  Last night was such a fucking bummer. I was upset about the Andy-call and because I was doing a great job of just trying to push thoughts of him from my mind but suddenly it all came back. I was lying on my bed in the nice cool a/c, reading my book, and it got to a mildly sad part and then I couldn't stop crying. So I played fetch with the dog, which was so cute I had to call my mom to tell her. But then when I talked to her I remembered how lonely I was and started crying again. And then I cried about how I didn't even have any real tissues. And then the dog stole my roll of toilet paper. And it was all just awful and I finally cried myself to sleep watching Still Breathing. I have the fantastic puffy eyes to show for it this morning.

      Ok, the weekend is over, so I know what I need to do is...go back to my desk...settle down....focus...and catch up! (I think only 4 people in the universe know where that quote came from =)  Friday night Drew and I went to dinner (where the waitress kept winking at me, oooh la la!) and then to see Anchorman. Jazz flute, baby! LOUD NOISES!  Saturday afternoon my dad and Diane came to visit and helped me with the yard a little, then we went out to lunch and to the bookstore (dad bought me a book, yay!). It was really good to see them both. I can't wait to finish the book I'm reading now so I can start one of the new ones I got. I forgot how much I love reading. I'm becoming a book addict again I think.  Saturday night I got to hang out with Shad and meet a couple of his friends, they were really nice. And we watched the end of Easy Rider. God Bless Jimmy! When I got home it was really late and the puppy had already been asleep for a couple hours so I took him outside and then he was still sleepy enough that he slept with me all night, cute puppy! He's so sweet, I just love him to death.  Yesterday evening the puppins and I went for a walk, and then when we came back I think he must have really gulped down his food and water, because he was laying on the kitchen floor, which I thought was just him being cute, but then when I walked in there, I saw that the poor thing had thrown up =(  He's fine now, I just felt bad for him...  I was having little half-dreams as I was trying to fall asleep last night, thinking about what it will be like when I start dating again. Even though I abhor the thought of dating as a whole, it has its good points, like kissing someone new, all that electricity...I think I'm going to be ok, even though I know things are going to suck hardcore for a while.

      I'm finding that the whole breakup is pretty easy to deal with on a day-to-day level, considering Andy would be gone at camp whether we were together or not. As long as I try not to think about how it won't be kosher to hug and kiss him when he returns from scary God camp, I might just make it through the summer.   Today Nancy brought in Texas sheet cake to work. My favourite! I had two pieces. I'm weak. Then the dude from Cold Stone brought in a ridiculous ice cream cake because he loves us so. I of course had a piece of that. I'm dying of over-full-ness now. Too much chocolate!   Tonight I'm going to see Anchorman with Drew (and maybe Shad if he returns my call! =) and we're going to get some dinner and maybe hit the Green Door to catch up with Joann, one of my co-workers (her boyfriend owns the bar, how cool is that?) I'm excited that it's Friday and I have at least one friend to hang out with and my dad and stepmom will be in town tomorrow. Trying to think positive thoughts here, don't interrupt with all your "But Drew will be moving away soon!" and "Andy will find some Lutheran tramp who makes him happier than you did" bullshit, I don't want to listen.  Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...

      Little jingle-pup slept with me on the couch all evening after my mom left on Tuesday. And then he slept on my bed all night, which was comforting since I couldn't sleep at all. I woke up every 30 seconds hacking up a lung, but at least I had a cute puppy to look at in the lonely dark.  I came home yesterday after work and the pup had torn apart an ENTIRE phone book! What a little monster. But I love him anyway =)  As much as being this sick is killing me, I'm loving the loss of appetite. It's totally strange to not be preoccupied by food. I bought a Panera sandwich yesterday on my way home from work and I only ate like 1/4 of it. And then I put it in the fridge. And there it sits, waiting for me like a good little sandwich. Typically, I would have waited maybe 1/2 an hour until I had some more room in my stomach and then finished the rest of it. But I didn't! I'm so proud of myself! Especially since Panera is one of my all-time faves.  My daddy sent me a really nice card in the mail, and apparently I should be getting another one today, isn't that cute? He and Diane are going to come visit Saturday, yay!  When mom came to visit on Tuesday, Al and Hobo came too. The Hob-ster and Snickers got to meet finally! It was cute to see normally sluggish Hobo play like a puppy. He was batting Snickers around (in a gentle way =) and it was totally adorable.  I love my family =)

      I'm a single puppy-mom now. In the fall, I will be working 40 hours per week, going to school full time at night, and taking care of poor little Snickers somewhere in between.  "We're on different spiritual paths..."  Thank you, Michi-Lu-Ca, for taking my boyfriend and sending back to me an empty shell of "spirituality." I guess it's the Lutheran way to break up with your girlfriend the night before the huge party she's throwing you when she also happens to have some sort of bronchial infection...which she caught from you last weekend.   Andy never did have great timing. Or much tact for that matter.  I took care of him for three years. I cleaned up his messes, I made sure the bills were paid, I helped him find jobs. I thought of him every day. A million little things that went unnoticied. I thought it was ok, because I loved him so much. But really I was like a babysitter who never got paid.  Shana: Chapter Two. In which our heroine finds the strength to take care of herself for a change. And possibly finds someone mature and responsible to love.

      Are you seeing planes? Is your name Tattoo? Because I  swear  to God you're living on fantasy island. (A Night at the Roxbury is on TBS =)  Last night I left a fantastically drunken voicemail that I had  no business  leaving. The kind of voicemail you play for your friends because it's funny and pathetic. I don't really know what to do about that. I guess you can't really help who you fancy, can you? It's just a little harder than I thought it'd be to ignore it. Don't worry, I know it's not going to happen. But sometimes when you're drunk the thought processes don't quite connect the way they're supposed to...  Shan, Paul and I went bar hopping last night. I had such a good time, it was crazy. We went to the Green Door first to see Joann, and the band was really good. Then we hit Stober's - there were a couple really cute guys there but they weren't paying us any attention, damnitt! We ended up at Moriarty's, where we hung out with a couple guys we met. They were nice, we tried to hook one of them up with the really hot bartender but she wanted her neighbour dude instead. They came home to hang out with us after the bar closed but when Tim insulted my dog for the third time, I decided it was time for them to go the fuck home. We didn't go to bed until about 5:30 am, then the dogs woke me and Shan up around 7. And again at 8, 10, noon....it was a long ass morning.  Shan kept trying to hook me up with guys last night, she's so funny. I just love her. Too bad none of them were interested. What the hell? I'm hot, damnitt. And in the words of Shannon, I deserve a hot, tall, wealthy guy. So...where is he already?

I think we're going bar-hopping tonight, yay! Maybe I'll meet a cute boy. I'm sure Shannon will do her best to find me one =)

      Jen just complimented me again today on my weight loss. Mmm, love compliments! It motivates me to keep on exercising. Shan and Paul are coming over tonight, I can't wait! Maybe sansabelt, bwil, the hero, Joe and Beth will join us if any of them are free.  I'm hoping to hit up Super Saturday tomorrow, throwing things, yay!  John's gone today and Monday. The boredom has already set in. I have pretty much less than nothing to do. It's nice to be caught up, but I wouldn't mind a couple simple projects, just to pass the time.  The girls were just over here talking about food and now I have such a craving for Flat's Grille. Maybe this weekend sometime. I hope the sun comes out and it stays dry so I can take the puppy out for some walks. I feel bad for him stuck in the house all day while I'm at work =(  I took a bath this morning before work and I was sooo tempted to just stay there and give work the big screw you. But I'm a good little girl so I made it here early instead.

      I just talked to Andy for a while...and it was really nice. I cried a little, but mostly from remembering how awful things were for me right after the breakup. It felt really good to talk to him about things that have been going on while he's been at camp. And I find myself really interested to hear all his camp stories. And to see his freshly pierced ears. And his new haircut. Mine or not, we can't deny that Andy's just objectively hot. All that breath I wasted trying to get him to trim the hair and he goes and does it after we break up =)  I fell asleep twice in the bath earlier. I do that alot...it's amazing I haven't drowned yet.  WTF? I can't stop coughing all of a sudden. And wierd noises are coming from upstairs...CW must be participating in some kind of kinky sex acts...I'd rather not think about it.  Mmm, sleepy time...

      Oh, man. I don't even know where to start about the 'summer outing' last night. Our seats were practically on the frigging field, which was way cool. And it wasn't just dinner, it was like veggie tray, then salad, then huge plate of tasty food. And, get this: OPEN BAR. Have I mentioned recently that I  love  my office?  Unfortunately, it started pouring. But the stadium opened up a pavillion on the other side for us (still open bar!), so we moved it on over there. They eventually called the game, but nobody was really paying much attention anyway due to the liquor.  Then me, mom, Joann, Kendra, Bez and Scott went to the Green Door (Joann's boyfriend owns it) to hang out for a while. It was so much fun! The band was awesome and the company was fantastic. We didn't have to pay cover and Chuck bought us a round of drinks. Bez was totally rocked, it was too funny.  We got home around 12:30, went to bed around 1am. I was at work by 7:15 this morning. Uuuugh, so tired...  There were disposable cameras being passed around, so I'm sure there'll be some truly spectacular pictures later on =)

      Hee, I love my mom. She came in to visit and see the office since she's in town. The first person I took her to meet was Kendra. As I'm introducing them, mom and I both picked a loose hair off the other's shirt, it was practically choreographed. We're more and more alike every year, I swear. Bez thinks mom and I look a lot alike, which was kinda strange. I always hear that Nic and I are practically twins, but I rarely hear that mom and I look alike. She's blonde, I'm brunette. She's a green-eyed lady, I'm a brown-eyed girl. Oooh, but we're both cute and fun, so that must be where the similarities kick in ;)  And, of course (clearly I'm psychic, or just know my mom too well =), practially the first thing she said to me was, "you look so good! you've really been losing weight, haven't you?!". And then Jen said later, "wow, now that I look at you, you really  have  lost weight, haven't you?" What girl doesn't like compliments? ;) I'm still far from where I was at the thinnest point in my adult life, but I feel like I'm getting closer and closer every day. Soon I will squeeze my tush into the elusive american eagle jeans once again! I hope I didn't throw that pair out...those were hot jeans, dude. I think I got my first ever, "damn, Shana..." from a boy while wearing those jeans.  I'm so excited about the game!! I just hope it doesn't rain. Frigging Michigan weather. Can you imagine living somewhere down south where the only choices are warm, hot, and hotter? Not like here in the middle of March where you could conceivable end up wearing either snowpants, a rain poncho, or shorts and a swimsuit.  Mmmm, sugar-free caramel nip, you are my friend. Even though one of you exploded in the bag and made a gooey mess. And you sometimes get stuck in my teeth. I still love you.

      People at work are starting to notice that I've lost weight. My mom is going to freak the hell out when she sees me tomorrow, I can pretty much guarantee. I just traded in some too-big pants in favour of the next smaller size, and now the new pants are already loose again. I rock my own ass. And I don't mind saying it because I've been busting that very ass at the gym on a ridiculously regular basis. And once Nic comes back to school, we're going to work it on out with crazy Mari Winsor and her pilates. That lady scares me, but if she can tone my arms and butt, more power, crazy bangs.  La la la, I'm moving things around because the b.s. below didn't really belong with the post I threw it in last night. It doesn't really belong here either, but it's closer. Here's the logic: the thinner I get, the better chance I have at finding a date so that I don't have to whine like this again:  I cannot stress enough how much I need a date. Unfortunately I know absolutely nobody who interests me/is worth my time, with the exception of a very stupid, very girly crush that was beyond my control (what's a girl to do when she meets a tall, handsome boy who has a movie collection to rival her own?) and was clearly just wishful thinking on my part. I'm not looking for anything serious for christ's sake, I'll settle for a crush on a cute,  attainable  guy. I mean, c'mon, as much as I hate to admit it to myself, the fact of the matter is some people think I'm actually pretty cute. I'm smart. I'm occasionally funny. I'm generally sweet. I like to do nice things for people. I think that all adds up to make me a fairly datable gal. Or maybe I'm taking too many of those crazy pills I got from Will Ferrell. Regardless, it's my blog and I'll whine like a girly-girl if I want to =p

      Ok, I pretty much didn't sleep at all last night. I was worrying about things I couldn't control and my hips were hurting from all the jogging I've been doing lately. I did, however, in those precious few moments of sleep, have some really fantastic dreams. Mmm, lovely, sweet, kissing, hand-holding type dreams.  So it was an early morning for me, a scrunchy but pleasant car ride to Comerica (it's clear now that Joe is even more cool than I thought before - I wish Beth would have come with us though). Then 3+ hours in the hot, hot midday sun, 7 homeruns but we didn't even win. Fantastic sunburn on my face and shoulders. Followed by a trip to Matt and Lindsay's (love them!), and an even more scrunchy car ride home. But the first 45 minutes of it was totally worth it because I was laughing so hard I was crying. My ass hurts so much I cannot even believe I'm sitting on it. I'm dying to go hit the gym but they close at 8pm on Sundays.  I can be such a cranky bitch when I'm tired and hot and uncomfortable. I sincerely apologize to whoever needs an apology. I still love everybody, regardless of my bitch-fest and personal issues.

      Ok, dude.   I have an ACIDIC hangover. Plus, I'm still drunk. I cannot believe I made it home in one piece. Surprisingly, the dog was not barking when I came in the house. Good Snickers!! I had such a fucking blast last night that I don't even care that I was probably too drunk to enjoy a lot of it. Sansabelt let me sleep in his bed while he slept on the couch, I feel bad =( But I hope he woke up enough to go back to his bed for the next few hours, since it was 6 FREAKING 30 when I left. Jeff rocks (is that even his name? can't remember). Joe and Beth, you are two of my new favourite people. Steph and Brian, you already know how I feel about you. Love y'all to bits.

      Oh man. I really  did  have too many drinks last night. Ooof, bit of a hangover...but I had a blast so I'll take it.  Now it's time for a serious post. Below is a post on my favourite  urlLink lapband  board and my response. MO = morbidly obese.    Bright said:  "My sister is anorexic/bullemic and weighs less than 100lbs - she looks scary, and we worry so much about her - when I went to France to "interview" my surgeon who eventually performed the wls, he was asking about my family history - I told him about my sister, and he said "you are both exactly the same - it is the same illness, establishing itself in different ways...." I was watching some old video the other day of me about 2 years ago, at my top weight of 330lbs, and I was shocked at how awful I looked, not just vanity wise, but all puffed up with a sheen of sweat on my face... straining to walk around Disney World.... I was really angry watching that from the perspective of 80lbs lighter - where the hell were my family/friends at that time? Nobody ever took me aside and said "hey, you are going to die young here - can I help you fight this?" Everyone rallied around my sister and begged her to get help, literally moved mountains to help her - I never thought anything of this other than, she has a serious problem and I'm just stupid and fat. It is way more politically correct to be anorexic/bullemic than MO, if you know what I mean. I talk a lot about being MO these days - talking to family/friends about the reasons I got so overweight, and they all kind of turn away, and find the subject a litte distasteful, as if I was sharing too much intimate information..... Fat is definitely the last taboo..."   ________________________________________________________________       I said:  "Wow, Bright. You know, I've realised for a long time that being morbidly obese and being anorexic are two sides of the same coin. I'd started to understand that I have a disease that I can't just fix by having more willpower or exercising more or eating a strict diet.... but I never gave any thought to the "help/intervention" issue until your post. You are so right. I mean, how many after school specials and health classes have been dedicated to anorexia and bulimia? It's been drilled into our heads constantly. It's always on tv, it's always in the news, it's constantly talked about and rallied against.       Where's the coverage of MO? How about an afterschool special about a girl who's so obese her joints ache and she can barely breathe and she's slowly killing herself because of her co-morbidities? I want to see  that  show. I want kids to learn about  that  in health class. If my best friend was anorexic, you can bet your ass there'd be one hell of an intervention. But if she was morbidly obese it just wouldn't be the done thing to bring it up.       I can remember when I was younger (overweight but not terribly so), when I would see an extremely heavy person on a talk show or in the street, saying to my best friend, "just shoot me if I ever get that big!" Well, I may not need a crane to lift me out of the house, but pre-surgery I was big enough that my weight was keeping me from living my life the way I wanted to. Where was the person who was supposed to keep me from that? Would I have even listened?       It's so taboo to bring up obesity; I know I wouldn't have listened had a loved one tried to tell me I was literally killing myself. But really, is it any different than the way an anorexic person would react to such concerns? I doubt that an anorexic would be particularly open to "help" from a loved one. But does that mean that you just let her waste away? HELL NO. You risk pissing her off if it means she might get healthy. You get her help, come hell or high water. And even if she hates you for the rest of her life, if she gets healthy as a result, it's worth it.      I don't really know where I'm going with this. I just want awareness for morbid obesity. I want widespread knowlege to replace stupidity and ignorance. I want to know what I can do to start things moving in that direction."   I have so much to say on this issue I can't even sort it in my head. That frigging mantra, "weightloss really just amounts to burning more calories than you take in..." is such a FUCKING JOKE. It's a god damned DISEASE, whether the general public wants to admit it or not. Hi, my name is Shana, and I suffer from binge eating disorder. There, are you happy now? Does calling it by its name make it seem more legit? No matter how much I tried to exercise more and eat less, it didn't work. The extra weight is just the symptom of something larger. I think having an actual, physical restraint on my stomach is possibly the only thing I could have done to drag myself out of that mindset. And I am so glad I did it. I never knew before how much I relied on food. I had some really nasty depression after the surgery when suddenly my best friend (food) turned its back on me. Oh, swiss cake roll, you'll never leave me...what? I can't eat you anymore because you make me feel kinda sick? Screw you swiss cake roll! I never really liked you that much in the first place! I'm going to go chill with salad and  then  we'll see who's leaving who! I definitely still have food issues. It's a daily battle. But I'm slowly starting to put food in its place, and it's the biggest accomplishment of my life.

I loved her dearly and right now I miss her terribly. She's been gone for a long time but it still seems like yesterday that I read books and crosstitched and picked raspberries and gardened and made necklaces with her. From now on, when I feel alone, I'll remember our little poem and I won't feel so lonely. I love you gramma.

      Ok, once in a while, we get some real crazies here in the office.  urlLink This , for example, is a former client. And yes, he believes everything he's written on his page.  Yesterday we had a doozy of a client, fresh from the institution. Remind me to give you a few gems from our time together in person. Trying to explain the man here just wouldn't do justice...  Ooooh, I just remembered I have to go turn in my timesheet. Payday tomorrow, yay! Too bad the whole lot is already spoken for (rent, credit card bill, savings...). If I'm lucky tomorrow's check will include my reimbursement for all the medicine I bought a few weeks ago and I'll be able to keep a little money in my checking account for fun things.

      I mowed my lawn yesterday. It was (don't laugh) the first time I have ever, in my life, mowed a lawn. Don't call me pathetic - because of my asthma and allergies I'm not supposed to, I swear! Anyway, I was really proud of myself. Especially because my lawn is so sodding uneven that it was like mowing a series of hills and valleys. My arms are feeling it today, man.  Nip/Tuck was really good last night - can't wait 'til next week! Plus, Famke Jannsen is hot.  Some SOB brought danish into work this morning. So of course I had a piece. And of course it's not working out so well, so now I feel totally sick. Damnitt.  I had a fantastically awful dream last night. I was eating alone at a restaurant and Andy and one of his buddies walked in and I said hey, assuming they'd join me. They walked over toward me, but at the last minute turned and went to another table. Talk about a crushing blow. I was in total shock, I couldn't believe he did that. In real life, one of my biggest fears is that I won't get to hang out with him anymore. Boyfriend or not, he's been a really big influence in my life and I'd like to keep it that way. Who else knows how to make the chub-chub sound or wants to play frisbee with me? I miss my buddy.

      Working out is addictive...and really tiring. My leg and arm muscles are crying, "massage me! put me in a hot tub!"  I want to buy a house by this time next year. I wonder if my dad will co-sign a mortgage with me?  I also want a boy. It's too bad you can't just go pick one of those out. Well, I guess you can. But houses don't reject you like boys might.  Ooooh, at least I have unconditional puppy love. The Doodle got a new harness tonight and a little soft brush and a cool toy that you put food or treats in and they come out when he plays with it. He was going nuts with that thing, it was so cute =)  Hmmm....still want a boy....

      I know this is really mean, but I'm not including the poster's name, so I don't feel quite so bad.

(thank God)Thursday I went and applied for my lone (for the third time) for the surgery. And packed up some more. ( Did I minten that I hate packing)Friday I found out that I was denied for the lone for the third time after working for the last month and half to clean up my credit. I know that these aren’t big thing and that I shouldn’t weri about them except for the lone but they are to me.(The Question) Dos any one have any suggestions on where I can look for foundational add. My incurrence will not pay for this and I can’t change incurrence comaneyThanks for letting me talk.Ellen P.s. I hop next week gos better   Now, keep in mind that the bare minimum age for someone to be banded is 18, and the typical bandster is 30+. How does someone go through any kind of schooling and come out with spelling skills like this? She can handle the words, 'suggestions' and 'foundational' (whether that's really a word or not, it's spelled right!), yet she thinks 'loan' is spelled, 'lone' and 'insurance' works better as 'incurrence'? Maybe I'm just a grammer and spelling snob, but HOLY COW.
