      Give me a break!!!! I would love to just move out right now and everything would be perfect! I'm so ready to get out. I'd be free. I was talking to my friend amber, and we decided that were going to go and get an apartment, cause we both need to get out, and anyways her mom charges her rent already...$150 a month, that sucks. I just want to be on my own and not have to hear everyone tell me what i need to do. I can make my own decisions and live my life how i want to. I just need to finish school and then everything else will follow...yeah thats it.   ------------ More ---------------  Well last night went to my friend hillarys house and watched some wrestling and some clone high...that show is awesome, they were talking about a.d.d. and a.d.h.d. a.d.d.'s hyperactive cousin  its a funny show, tom green was on the show too.   ------------ Yes you need to read more ------------  I want to go to boston again or out to california, i could live in boston and be very happy. its really cool out there, tons of stuff to do. I think next year i'm going to plan a trip out to boston with some friends...maybe i wont come back.   well thats all for now...till later.

      I wish i knew how to make some of my friends realize how to make things better. It makes me soo mad sometimes that i cant do anything to make things better. There is way to many things going on between our group of friends, and its scareing some people i think. What to do what to do??

      Hmmm no responses...a friend told me that love will smack you in the face when your not looking for it. Maybe, but how long has it been since i've last been in a relationship??? 5 years maybe...yeah this isnt fun...here is something just off the top of my head.  sitting here alone with no one to talk to i dont understand why i must go through this when time seems to drag on  people say just to have patience how can i when its been to long stuggling to hold on to what i feel i need, without you standing by my side is what i really need  Where have you gone? what do you need? understanding nothing, in my parallel dream  How can i understand? when i've been hurt by you nothing more i need, than just to be with you  Slower the days go bye more melodic and wavering like the tides moon shines bright above your gaze does hold love  Where do i go from here? should i tread on? when everything seems hopeless where do i belong?

      Some people are just stupid or not smart...I worked for this guy and he sent me my tax stuff...well he put the information in the wrong spot and wont change it to how it should be. Even the I.R.S. told me that he needs to change it. Well he'll get a nice letter from them in the mail in about a week. Hope he doesnt get to upset, he could of fixed it pretty easily.

      Where do i start??? Yesterday was valentines day. This usually was the one day out of the year where i knew that i'd be by myself. Well not this year. It was the  BEST  day/date i've ever had. Its also the longest date i've every been on....about 12 hours long.   First of all it started off by me going to go and pick her up at her place. She got me a card and fun dip. The card she gave me was perfect, and the fun dip, hey who doesnt like fun dip? Well after that i took her to our first place we were going to go to. I didnt tell her what we were going to do, but i did tell her where we were going. I wanted it to be a surprise. We went to Kensington Metropark, to go and feed the birds from out of your hand....its very cool, we had a really good time doing that. We decided then to go walk the trail a bit, and then something happened that maked the date even better....we came across about 9 deer, that were only about 10 feet away from us...it was really cool...we were holding hands by then and just watching the deer and what they were going to do. The baby deers started to follow us, which was also cool...we had a really good time at kensington.  The second place we went to was to go and eat....i really didnt have an idea on where we were going to go, but there was a place in livonia that i wanted to go to and try, and she said she was up for anything. We went to Buca di Peppo. Its an italian resturant where they serve family size portions. We got this shrimp pasta stuff, it was good, but there was a ton of food....we could only eat one serving and we were both full...sooo we left.  The third place that we went to was just a place for us to talk...so we went to the Coffee Bean Coffee House in Plymouth. I think we got there around 5 and we didnt leave till 9:30...we talked about everything. It was great. Never did we have a pause in conversation....which when you usually talk to someone for 4.5 hours, there usually are points when you cant think of anything to say...that just didnt happen. But the day/date wasnt over...  The fourth and final thing we did was we went to go see the movie "How to lose a guy in 10 days". It was a really good movie, its not quite a girl movie and its not quite a guy movie...I enjoyed it and i know she did too...we were the last two people to leave the inside of the theater, cause we really didnt feel like in any kind of a rush. It was late by then so i decided to take her home. We took the long way back so we could still talk some more....i've never been this comfortable talking to anyone for this long....when we got back to her place i walked her to her door, gave her a hug goodnight...i wanted to give her a kiss goodnight, but i want things to go smoothly between us, so we'll know when it feels right (although it did last night).   I cant say that i have have'd a better time than i did yesterday. I know that i wont be able to spend the money always like that, but it was definetly worth it too have that good of a time with her...wouldnt change anything that happened yesterday.  Stay tuned for more....

      New poem/song whichever you want to call it   Lifetime  by Jason Law  lifetimes can pass you by faster than the days go by tender beauty, i'll address life without you, such a mess  softer than the pillow feathers your skin, your smell, your getting better every night and day i feel you closer without you i feel under the weather  between these lines of love and hate there the dilema begins, i'll state when hate is something absent from us without you i turn to dust  to be able to breathe you in and then to see you grin my heart does pull hard next to you i will guard  now the days go by with much sorrow to know that one day there will be no tomorrow forever though our hearts will be as we walk together, just you and me

      Things seem to be getting better...yes i'm actually saying that, its not the normal stuff you hear me say, but i'm feeling good about certain things. Mostly tomorrow is going to be a good day i hope. Today is ok, not feeling to good, so i didnt go to school...i did email my paper though to my teacher so i hope that'll be ok...she hasnt responded to me about that but ohh well. I have a new outlook on life, and it seems to be working...dont put all your hopes in one area, spread them out and your bound to have more success....so far its working out...peace.

      yesterday was a bad day...was just in a bad mood all day. Had to do jury duty in the morning but wasnt picked, but before that i got lost in detroit trying to find the building. Then after i got home, my sister felt like arguing with me, then my parents got home and i got the same thing, so i decided to leave. I usually just do that and drive around anywhere to try and cool off...then michelle called and we were going to hangout, but it was getting late and she was going to go to bed, well i still was in a bad mood and kinda took it out on her a little.....thats not me......i called her right back and apologized, but i never take my bad day out on someone else, and i especially dont want to do that on her. I feel really bad. I went over to hills after that, and just felt shitty about myself, so i had a beer...yeah i know its not the answer, but it felt good. I also havent eaten in 2 days, so it hit me hard...i fell asleep there till 1 then left and went home......i hope today is better....

      Never knew it wouldnt take much effort to be happy. I had another great time last night, well the time from around 6-11:30.   First of all yesterday was my moms and my grandpa's birthday. My mom turned 48, and my grandpa 80. So we went over to my grandparents house to celebrate their birthdays, and we played some games and ate some food. Now i was going to stay the whole time, but my sister who is evil, had to ruin it for me. She started to say things to me about this girl that i'm seeing, that were not too nice or just didnt make sense. First she asked me if she was black, like that matters...second then she asked me if she was pregnant, which didnt make any sense, then she asked me if she was ugly, and that made me mad. My mom was sitting right there and heard what she was saying and was giving my sister bad looks. Then what made me madder was that she called me a liar. She was trying to make me feel bad or something just to make her feel good, cause when i'm happy about something, she always tries to do that. On top of all that, she asked me if i could give her a ride home HELL NO!!!! I left right then and said goodbye to everyone and wished my mom and grandpa a happy birthday and headed out.  Well i had nothing else to do and i wanted to see michelle. So i gave her a call once i got a signal on my cell phone, and she said it was ok for me to come over. I got there around 6, i met her dad who seemed nice, but we didnt really get a chance to talk about anything. Then me and michelle went into the living room and watched tv. At first we were kinda just sitting next to each other but by the end of the night we were cuddling together and holding hands....my hand fell asleep past the point of being asleep, it wasnt even tingling...i didnt care though i was too comfortable and happy just to be lying there with her. I really didnt  want to leave, i could of just stayed there on that couch forever and would of been happy...i've never felt so comfortable being around someone like i am with her....it feels good. Well i think i'm going to see her again tonight and then tomorrow night too over at hillarys...i cant wait!!! :) Well stay tuned for much much more!

      Updated my business site this week, it seems to always be changing. Check it out!  urlLink http://www.inter4design.com  .  Went last night to the movies and saw The Hunted, it was a pretty good movie, wasnt the best one i've ever seen but it was interesting. Just reminds me never to get into a knife fight, never know if someone who looks like tommy lee jones could kick your ass. My mom talked to my aunt yesterday and she told her about me moving out in the fall, she said that it is probably a good idea. She also does web design and graphic design stuff but she lives in L.A. where there is more work but you have to be pretty good at what you do to get work. I think i'm pretty good from what people have said who have seen my work. Well i'm off of here, need to figure out some stuff.... later

      I have no idea if anyone reads what i write. So this is a test....Well i was walking my dog down the street, when all of a sudden my older brother came up to me and asked if i had taken his money. I said no cause i just won the lottery so i didnt know what the hell he was talking about. But because of all of the crazy things that my sister does my brother thought it was me for some reason. I just got my new jet, which i'll use on the weekends, but i really like me audi tt. Well whoever reads this i guess i'll find out.

I've invited alot of people to go, but the one person that i'd like to go hasnt called me back telling me that she'll be there :( ... I know she's busy and all lately, with the new job and helping out her sister, but if she cant go or if she can i'd wish she call and let me know. Ohh i still dont know if i have the head counselor position yet at work...i was supposed to be contacted yesterday and i wasnt, so maybe today i will know.

      Hey guess what i got in the mail today!!!!!!!! MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah i got 2,645.50 HELL YEAH!!!! Its money that i got from school, cause i didnt go to school in the fall but i did in the winter, so they gave me the money i didnt use for fall and i can do whatever i want with it....of course i'm going to save all of it except i'm using the 645 for bills so 2000 is goin into savings. So i'm not broke anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but that doesnt mean i'm gonna start buying stupid stuff, i'm done doing that....time to be more responsible with my money, like saving up so i can afford to move out, which looks like it'll be happening more and more each day!

      1.  The road represents your attitude towards falling in love.      You chose the short road--you fall in love quickly and easily.  2.  The number of red roses represents how much you give in a     relationship, while the number of white represents what you     expect in return.      You give 50% and expect 50% in return.  3.  This question represents your attitude towards handling     relationship problems.      You asked the family member to get your significant other--you     like to avoid problems and hope that they will solve themselves.  4.  The placement of the roses determines how much you like to see     your boy/girlfriend.      You want to place the roses on the bed--you like to see him/her     a lot.  5.  This represents your attitude towards his/her personality.      You prefer the person to be asleep--you love the person as the     way s/he is.  6.  The road to home tells how long you stay in love with someone.      You chose the longer road--you will tend to stay in love for     a long time.  That's all folks.  Best wishes to those who are in love.

      How hard should i be trying??? Should i just leave it alone and let the possiblity of something happening, which never does due to me usually doing that.....or should i keep doing what i'm doing? I'm tired of being left in between the void of knowing what is going on and whats not going on. I feel as if i'm a bit empty sometimes....yes this all sounds very confusing, but i know a few people know what i'm talking about..............  Well i got the head counselor position at work so thats cool....i cant wait for summer to start. I want school to be over right now, i'm done with this stuff.........i just want to move on!!!!!

      Hey its my birthday today...actually at 3:30pm it is, but thats not the point...I'm going to bahama breeze for lunch/dinner around 3....It's going to be fun. I'm 22 but i dont feel like it at all. Ok now for something alittle off topic...i dont understand why people call my house at 10:30 at night asking for me, my parents are asleep by then, people need to call my cell so the house phone doesnt wake everyone up. I'm fricken starving right now, but i think i'm going to wait till we go out that way i can eat alot. People give me a call later if you want to do something....i'll probably be over hills later. see ya.

I had a good conversation with my friend hillary last night and made me realize some things about myself and my friends, and i feel very lucky to have them. They're almost like family to me, i can talk to them about anything and just be myself. But for the last month or two i havent been feeling all that great. I havent found anything really that keeps my interest, everything is just kinda blah.....i dont know if i'm depressed or what, i probably am....cause i keep everything inside and dont show my feelings or emotions....cause i dont think i need to worry people about things.....i feel as if i'm almost self-destructive.

      Ok, i havent posted in here in awhile so i think i'll give it a try....Well this week has been great and not so great... First of all we had mini day camp this last week which was alot of fun to work at. I cant wait till summer starts when the summer day camp starts. The field trips were fun too. Detroit Science Center and Basketron/Lazer Tag. That was the good things about last week...the bad things i found out were that my mom is going to have to get another surgery done to remove some pre-cancerous moles on her back, and my sister got a biopsy done too this week, and my dad went into the doctors and had an xray done on his chest and they found that he has some kind of dark spot on his lungs, which they dont know what it is yet....so this is not good.  Not too happy about this, seems like i cant go by one week without having to worry about anything.....i hope this summer is much better.

      Its nice out finally, to the point where you dont have to wear a jacket or layers of clothing. spring is a good time of the year, and its also the time of the year when school gets over with. I'm finally finished with this school year!!! I'm looking forward to work this summer and hopefully finding a full time job by fall to get my own place. Thats the plan!!! Its what i need.

      I wish i knew how to make life less stressfull for everyone i know. I dont know what i can do for them or what i try to do is helping. Got to have a postive attitude about things and life in general. Dont let things that are little get to you. Like things that are not going to change you the rest of your life but may upset your weekend. I dont know why some people are so ignorant about this, but others do have definite stress and problems, those people i'll give my most attention and concern too, cause i cant stretch myself too thin, like i've done in the past.

      tuesday was a great day went out to the park with michelle and had some ice cream. But then after that i had to work, which wasnt that great, but the beginning of the day made up for that. Thats about it for today...i dont have anything that exciting to say today...maybe later though

      calm comes after the storm  daylight breaks the clouds that rained before tension released and pressure subsided all that was left before is washed away with a new feeling of happiness and joy  calm comes after the storm  wonder where it was all before nothing less but more unknown what comes next is a little more than before things are better now when the  calm comes after the storm

      Ok...so this weekend is boring, all i've done is work and be lazy sitting at home. But i havent really been at home that much lately. Half of my friends (the ones who are girls) went to Chicago this weekend, i got a call from them today and they said that their having a great time....i think its time i go on a vacation too....but i want to go camping somewhere. I havent gone in a long time and i love to be outdoors...i want to take my mountain bike with me too, and do some trail riding, that'd be fun...but i know it wont be this week, maybe next week i'll go.

      wow, i've havent felt so sick like this in awhile. coughing, nose running, sore throat. It sucks! Plus going to the club last night didnt make things any better, that was a dumb thing to do, since i didnt get home till 4 in the morning!!!!!!!! I'm not smart, not thinking. I had fun, kinda last night just wasnt really into dancing then my knee started to hurt which wasnt cool at all. I was supposed to hang out with michelle yesterday but that didnt happen, was a little dissapointed that we didnt get to see each other, but things happen and plans change, i'll probably talk to her tomorrow. I missed work this morning also cause i had no voice at all and to teach swim lessons on saturday mornings you need to have  a voice, well mine was cracking and i couldnt talk louder than a normal inside voice, so i couldnt make it in. So i went back to sleep and didnt wake up till 4, i'm feeling a little bit better now but thats only because of the medication. well thats all for now, there'll be plenty more for later.

Plus i can remember everything that happened last night so no blacking out.  I also got to know a person alittle bit  better last night too...which i'll go into detail later....

      Work, work, and more work...that seems to be all that i've been able to think about for the last week or two...well not the only thing, and nothing really is going on with that. I'm ready to be in a long-term steady relationship...have been for awhile, the waiting game isnt fun...but when i like someone i try to keep my attention on them and no other person who i may like......its weird...i know..........My neck is killing me right now, i hate getting stiff necks!!!!!!!!!

      Last night was alot of fun! Drove out to jackson to see a friends band play at some small garage/bar place...where the hicks live. Well the trip there and home was more fun than being there and watching them play. Although i need to get a new pair of sunglasses, but all in all it was a good time. NEED TO GO BACK AND GET A PICTURE WITH THE LHAMA!!

      what can i say? not much. Its been a pretty stressful week. Alot of work and planning has been done for this summer at work. Things being done at the last minute, and things being thrown to the side. I like being busy, but i just hope that with all of the work that we've done that it actually comes out good. My boss hasnt even told us that we've done a good job, so it sometimes seems that we're doing alot of work and that no one notices. I dont know....

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.........i dont understand girls at all, they say one thing then do another. When someone who once was with someone and they decided a long time ago that being together would never work, then they move in together into an apartment, and they still say their just friends....then you say something like "at least i dont have an alcoholic boyfriend" which i guess she just slipped and said, so i asked her if she and her friend are still just friends..................long pause...................... "well when alcohol is involved alot of things you may not want to say are said" then she doesnt want to talk to me about what that means right now..................ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.............why cant i just find someone who i can understand???? I always find the ones who are confusing to figure out and never give you a clear understanding of where you stand in a relationship. i dont think there's anything wrong with me at all!!!!! I've given her all the respect that i could possible give, i just dont understand what else i can do. Seriously..............some people just dont make any sense!!! Be honest with me cause thats how i am, i never lie to anyone about anything just let me know what is up and i'm fine, but say your doing one thing and then do another, i dont know what to say to that!   ...........very confused!

      Well what an interesting week it has been, since my parents have been out of town for a week now. Had a party which was fun and been pretty busy with work. Been thinking about a lot of things lately, about friends, relationships, life, work and everything else.....i love the friends i have, i'm ready to be in a long term relationship, i'm happy where i am in life right now and work is keeping me busy. Not too much more to say than that, nothing to complain about really.......just ready to move onto the next step in life.

      can i go through one week without hearing any kind of bad news??? Now i found out that my dad went in to have a biopsy done on something in his thyroid and its being sent to stanford university to be checked out cause it has abnormal cells in it. It could be thyroid cancer.....he may have to have kemo done after they do surgery to remove one of his thyroids then after that i dont know what else their gonna do....this is scaring me cause first i find out my biological grandfather has a cancer/tumor in his heart and is dying and now my father may have thyroid cancer...my grandfather is on my moms side though, and he has diabetes too, so it runs on my moms side of the family for heart disease and diabetes and also on my fathers side....its been on my mind alot and i dont know whats gonna happen, and my father really doesnt talk that much about his health condition cause he likes to think that he's really healthy...so i find these things out days later after he knows about it......i just dont know what to do right now....its frustrating and stressing and scary.

      well its been a little while since i've last posted...things have happened since then. My mom's dad and my biological grandfather is not doing so good, he has a heart tumor and only has 4-6 weeks left to live. The thing is i'm confused about how to feel, i mean i never really met the guy or considered him my grandfather cause he never really tried to be my grandfather. I guess i shouldnt really feel like i'm missing anything cause i do have a grandfather who i love which i've known my whole life. So i guess i'm the one who isnt missing out on knowing him, he's missing out on knowing me.

      Long time nothing written...havent had the time, or the motivation to write in here. Just dont want to sometimes...but i have good news!!!! I'm sending in my application for an apartment today!!!!!!!!!!!! Hopefully it gets approved and then i can move out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It'll be great to be out on my own, i'm movin out with my friend brian. What we found is at Harbor Club in Belleville. $620 a month but you have to pay electric and water, which sucks, but its still cheaper than anywhere else we have found. It's a 2 bedroom/bath apartment with washer/dryer, dishwasher and everything...pretty cool.     Another topic........  I'm giving up on trying to see a certain person due to the realization that i've come to is that she is way to immature. This is the 3rd time we've made plans to do something and that it hasnt happened. The day we are supposed to do something she wont be able to be reached by phone or anything, she just disappears, and then you cant even get a hold of her afterwards to find out what happened. Today is wednesday, and our date was for sunday...havent heard shit. What is with people??? no respect, i just cant trust cetain people i guess. Only close friends right now i guess....other than that, there's no one....kinda depressing actually. well....................  TILL LATER!!!!!!!!!

      everything is packed and ready to go...seems so empty with only the bed in the room. But tomorrow is gonna be a busy day. Signing the lease, moving stuff in...getting my "new" bed in, putting everything together....its going to be fun. cant wait. most of my friends are gonna help me move too, which i appreciate cause i'm gonna need all the help that i can get.  Well this may be the last post for awhile till i get access to the internet...wait i said that last post...i guess i lied....well till later!

      Only 1 more day to get through then i move into my apartment! It'll be nice to get out.  Ok i've come to realize that people in livonia dont know how to drive. 6 mile was full of idiots who dont look when they drive and they think that going 50 during rush hour is going to solve anything...i dont think so.  I figure that once i move into my apartment i'll have many, many, many stories to tell you all. But untill then i've got pretty much nothing...i'm ready for new experiences and basically a new life. Keeping the friends...just new location. It may be awhile till i have access to the internet at my apartment, have to figure out how were gonna deal with that.  Well till later!

Tonight were having a stock party...its gonna be fun! Hopefully no one gets sick.   Were getting two more couches next week...so that means the futon goes out onto the balcony. So we'll have 3 couches total...way cool, more room for people to sit...which is always a good thing. Well i'll write more about the party tomorrow, after i've done recovering... peace.

       Well tonight was alot of fun! Went out and actually did somethings. First of all i went to go and see the movie  Underworld  with my friend  urlLink Kimi . Great movie, i recommend everyone to see it! Then after the movie we went up to Baileys our normal hang out spot and had a couple of drinks. Met our friend jenn up there too who i havent had a chance to see in awhile and catch up on things. It was nice. Ohhh my friend  urlLink Sara  who works up there at Baileys had her hair dyed, and it looks good! I like it alot. After Baileys me and kim went back to her house and just watch some stupid tv show hosted by Carmen Electra on Tv Commercials. I hate shows like this where they try to be funny and its really fake and annoying.    Tomorrow we get two new couches!!! Futon is goin on the balcony. Everyone is welcomed to come and help out! k...thats all for now, peace out!

      I feel so tired right now....but its ok. Well lets see, the plan for tonight is to go and see michelle's apartment tonight, if that really happens, we'll just have to wait and see. I dont think i'm going to make a lunch tonight for work tomorrow, i'll go out and buy a lunch i guess. Its just that the traffic in Livonia (6, 7, 8 mile/haggerty) is really bad. My job is interviewing a new developer tomorrow morning. Hope he's cool like all the other people working right now, and not some asshole loser.  Well i finally made a design for the Masco site that my boss liked. Only took 4 designs. Its a pretty cool design, one of my best, but the others were pretty damn good too. My boss is just really picky. I actually though had to go to lunch early cause they didnt have anything else for me to do, untill i came back from lunch. Web Design can get boring after awhile, but when someone tells you that they like your design alot, it makes you more motivated.  I think i'm gonna add some interactive stuff on my blog...just have to go and find the stuff, dont know what i want to put up yet though....hmmmm...well that's all for now... peace!

       So at my job today they put me on their timesheet manager...which means basically that i'm hired!!!! Yeah i know, i rock!   Other than that....have you ever had one of those mornings where you just dont want to wake up???????? I had one today...i was sooo comfortable in bed, i had thoughts of calling in sick or something or just showing up late and blaming it on the traffic. But i got up, i love my job....just that the bed felt sooo nice this morning.    I have to get my bathroom sink fixed, thats on the to-do list. For some reason the pipes and water pressure seem to get the need to push stuff back up the pipes and into my sink!!! It makes it smell like sewer, i think i need some liquid plumber or drano or something. whatever it is, dont like it! Looks all black and shit when it comes out....so i have to keep my bathroom door shut then, cause the smell gets tooo bad.  Well i have plenty more to say, but i'll save it untill later....peace

      Last night was the party to start it all!!! Had a stock the bar party, and everyone showed up. It was tons of fun. Played darts, euchre, poker, laughed, and consoled friends who were praying to the  porcelain shrine .  I was even surprised that Michelle did show up. Well she said she would but she got there around 1 or so ( yeah i know i havent talked about her in awhile, but...ya know ). I got to show her my place and everything. But mostly we were helping her sis my best friend kimi with what she was needing to do ( you know what i'm talking about ).   I think i'm gonna change the layout of my blog...something that has to do with the apartment now. Well that'll happen later.  peace

      Well...since its been awhile since i've posted (from what i've been told) I'll give you a little something. I recieved my first check in the mail yesterday from work...$1120.00 ....very nice...i'll be getting around 900 or so i believe once i'm an actual "employee" of ZenaComp. But before that happens i'll be getting another check around the same amount soon.    What's with the weather??? Had to go an buy a fleece jacket yesterday cause i had nothing that was semi-warm/fall jacket. So made a trip up to meijer again. Yes i saw michelle there, we talked on her break. Nothing else happened....she still is saying that she wants me to see her place, but somehow plans always fall through.  Ok...back to other more important stuff! I'm pissed! My bathroom sink still is not fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The maintence guy is supposedly coming out today to fix it, but originally wasnt going to come out till monday, asshole, fuckers, WHORES! It smells like shit, i dont even want to use it, let alone if someone was to visit and use the bathroom i dont want them even near it.   Assholes!

Then stayed over at kims, cause today we went to the Renaissance Festival. Me and hill, went last year and it was alot of fun. This time we brought kim who popped her renaissance virgin cherry. Wasnt too painfull now was it? Well thats all i did this weekend and it went by fast. Now i'm just doing laundry for this week. Well that's all...till later!

Didnt get back to the apt till 3 am.   Today i went to Christies, daughters b-day party. She just turned 5. She's a really cool kid. I got her a fusion bead craft set. We went to Ceaserland for her birthday. It was alot of fun. Tomorrow i'm bringing my cat here to the apt where she'll stay from now on. Not going to pay the deposit yet untill i have to, and if they see it i'll just say that i was watching it for a friend. That'll work, right??? Well hopefully.

She said she'd call if plans changed...that was at 5:30 well its now 10:40...i'm not too happy! When i make plans i keep them and i dont let them get broken by anything else, unless there was an emergency, which i dont think there is in this case. So if your a normal, regular girl...talk to me, if not i dont want to hear it!

      So...where are you gonna be this 31st of October? Hopefully your gonna be where the fun is at. Where the party is. That place you've been hearing so many things about. You know where it is. Its Apt 308. Things will happen that havent happened before and a surprise that know one knows about will be revealed. Ask all you want, you just have to wait. Look forward to the photos from the party coming next week!  Later!!!

      Welllllllll...since everyone thinks i should do another post, i will.  Whats new? ummm not a whole lot. I finding out more and more that I'm getting older and wanting less and less to be involved in childish highschool arguments and discussions. I've been ready to just move on past adolesence and into adulthood for a long time, but some people in my life just feel that having drama and being an ass is always a good thing to be. You dont have to be right all the time! Well now thats off my chest maybe i can be more positive.   I went out and bought xbox yesterday.... been playin Simpson Hit and Run all day. its alot of fun. I want to get halo and some other games but i'll have to wait on that.  Its already a week into november....time is goin by pretty fast it seems. 2 weeks is thanksgiving, and i have no idea what i'm doing...i think i'm going to go to my grandparents house our maybe at my parents, dont really know.   I think this is pretty good for now. Havent really had a chance to post that much with working and stuff.....but this is for you who requested and you shall receive...umm yeah. later!

Which was pretty cool.....

      Laundry day...yeah it sucks but needs to be done...i feel like i'm in such a routine...work monday thru friday, usually hang with someone on friday night..saturday see the parents and sunday spend all day doing laundry....repeat.... I need something more i think, dont know what but something...i like being spontenous (sic?). but just havent felt like i've had the motivation to or the time.  Its always different seeing my grandparents on my moms side. My grandpa always talks about money and my grandma really doesnt say too much to me. I hate the fact that they point things out to me...like i'm trying to lose some weight (15 lbs) and my grandpa says "hey looks like you put on some weight...looks good on ya" what can i say to that??? thanks alot, i'm actually trying to lose some weight and they keep telling me to eat more and to put on some weight...i dont know...its just annoying.

Been to Baileys tonight and had some drinks. now i'm pretty tired........ and i have laundry to look forward to tomorrow!!!!! yah!!!!!

       Out to the movies   You know whats funny?? Going to see Gothika last night and listening to all the little high school girls scream....It was as if they were overexaggerating the horror. I mean yeah, it can make you jump, but they were doing the full on death screams. I predicted before the movie that they would scream, just didnt know how right i would be. I went and saw it with Kim, dont really care if anyone gets pissed if we didnt invite anyone else to go with us....cant me and kim just hang out together and see a movie without having to invite everyone else?? I'm just waiting for the fallout, it'll come soon i bet. K... peace,...out forshizzle my nizzle, funky dizzle, its the shizzle

      Not much to really talk about for this weekend...didnt do too much. Went bowling with some friends on friday and then headed out to Baileys for some drinks. That was a fun night.... Saturday all i did was clean my room, which took awhile cause its pretty big.....bought a new hard drive, and a 7 port usb hub for my computer, but that was about it. Today just basically slummed around the apt.   Tomorrow is gonna be crazy. We're getting certified by Ford tomorrow so they're coming out to audit us from 8:30-4:30....its gonna suck! Ohh well dont have that much to worry about that....well thats all ttyl

      Feeling good today...I cant wait till i get my paycheck next week with my bonus!!! Gonna get some stuff for my room to make it look like a room, if that makes any sense to ya. Well most of you know that have seen my room know that i dont have that much in it. Mostly just my bed, computer, tv and now my new stereo. Other than that its pretty bare, but i did buy a clock for my room.   So i think that i'm gonna do some room decorating shopping. It echoes in here...thats how bad it is...cause there really is nothing in my room....Sad yes...  Hey if anyone wants to join me on Jan 2nd, i'm going to this bar that will have an irish band playing...i think it's like $5.00 to reserve a spot....but why wouldnt you want to go? I mean come on...irish music and sitting at a bar and drinking with friends, whats more fun than that???   Ohh anyone not have a date for New Years yet??? Give me a call... ;-)    Peace...

      This song takes on a lot of meaning right now...  I saw fireworks from the freeway and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  Cause you were born on the fourth of july, freedom ring   now something on the surface it stings  that something on the surface it kind of makes me nervous who says that you deserve this  and what kind of god would serve this? We will cure this dirty old disease  if you've got the poison I've got the remedy     the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison  I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words  I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on  So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.     I won't worry my life away.  I won't worry my life away.     I heard two men talking on the radio in a cross fire kind of new reality show  Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack   they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this  the unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe  dance with me, because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy      the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison  I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words  I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on  So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.     I won't worry my life away.  I wo'nt worry my life away.     When I fall in love I take my time  There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind  You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why  Because     the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison  I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words  I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on  So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.     I won't worry my life away.  I won't worry my life away.  I won't and I won't and I won't etc.

      rainy weekends...i do hate them. It better be nice out tomorrow but i have a feeling that its just going to rain all day. What have i been doing lately you might be asking yourself?? Well not a whole lot...i have been pretty busy with work, which i'm doing pretty good at right now. I'm taking on more of the role of web designer/web developer. My main title is graphic artist which really isnt the right title cause we do web work...but anyways i hope that all my extra work will pay off when it comes time to  getting my yearly review...i have already been awarded for my hard work...my boss last week gave me $250 in Best Buy gift cards!!! So i went out and got the Rio Karma mp3 player. Its pretty sweet...20gb of space, can connect to my home network, have a in car player for it too...i use it all the time....well i think i have been rambling on enough...ohh i'm thinking about getting a tattoo...dont know of what yet though...my friend sara just started working at eternal so maybe i'll have to go and visit her there too when i eventually decide on what i want to get....well ok..this is it...later.

Wearing work clothes too is really uncomfortable too....not like last year where i was wearing shorts all the time...that was nice...ohh well i guess thats why i'm in my apt. now, cause i'm not working at the summit anymore, and thats a good thing, but i do miss parts of my job that i miss...i'll hear all about whats going on from mike and hillary...well i think thats all for now, later.

      hehe...nothing like a good title huh? Well so it seems that things are finally getting back to normal...although i have a feeling things are going to be turned upside down and become much more complicated. But isnt that what life is supposed to be about? That if it was easy, what is the point??? If you didnt have to make hard decisions and things just fell into place wouldnt life just be boring and you wouldnt grow as a person??? Sorry for being so philosophical...but someone needs to do it!

      I feel so tired right now...mostly because i'm always busy with something. Which is a good thing. I can remember that last summer i had months at a time where had nothing to do....now i have committments, and routines, and the bills...but somethings dont change and hopefully they never do...still have the same friends...

Chorus  i know (x2) i know what i wanna be i know (x2) i know what your gonna see   Verse 2  sometimes i run through the tall grass... listen to sounds of the radio... and take pictures of the buildings and the trees as they fall... some how i figured out long ago... that its you that let me go...   Break  sometimes i sit outside... and try so i can feel inside... its time that i let you know... cause it was you that broke it so....

      why does everything right now seem so routine??? seems as if there is nothing sponteneous anymore. everything is planned and accounted for. nothing is done at the last moment or when you feel like doing it. You have to have plans to be doing something, you cant just go because you have no reason to. Seems like thats just something that is always going to be...sucks though if you think about it...cause every day you do the same thing...nothing really exciting really ever happens...for me its wake up, shower, get dressed and go to work, come home, try to eat something, make lunch go to bed....fucking routines...sucks

      So this last thursday was an interesting night. Alot of fun but interesting. We all decided that we go out to the club to go and celebrate mikes birthday, which is cool and all since i dont know what he's actually doing today since today is his real birthday, but anyways...we get to the club and as usual nobody is dancing or doing anything...everyone there is standing around the floor talking or just waiting for something to happen...usually it seems people have to have enough alcohol in their system before they get enough balls to actually get onto the floor and start dancing....so basically were the first ones to actual go onto the floor and start dancing, and just like every time people then follow our lead.....yeah thats right we start the party all the time....as the night goes on were all having fun, dancing, drinking, and other stuff, well i looked over to my left and noticed this small circle forming in the crowd...now i didnt know what was going on so i decided to find out what was going on...i just encountered my first dance off...it has to be the weirdest thing you could ever see...its like a fight where you throw dance moves instead of punches...seriously looks really stupid....kinda like someone was watching too much of that Wade Robinson Project show on MTV too much, or You Got Served...either way it was pretty funny to watch. All in all it was a fun night....cept when i had to wake up at 7 the next morning for work.

      this means alot right now...  There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise We'll be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

      I hate days when i have nothing to do at work...instead of designing something or working on a project i sit there staring at my computer screen, thinking that something important will come by, and then nothing does...this happens alot...give me something to do and i'll be happy, as long as its not just busy work...fuck if its just busy work thats not what i'm there to do...

      Ok, now i know alot of you have gone to the movies and encountered those people that find everything that is said freakin hilarious...right??? They annoy the hell out of you and even make you kinda embarrased because it seems so stupid for them to be laughing at something that is not that funny in the first place. Your probably wondering what i'm talking about if you have no idea right now, but i went to see "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle" with kim today and there were about 3 of these types of people. They laughed at basically everything that was said...cant just help to want to throw something at their head and have it hopefully lodge into they're mouth so they can not talk....its just really annoying...
