      A new car comes with an operator’s manual. The board game Monopoly has detailed instructions.  Even a simple windup alarm clock comes with a “how-to” booklet.  But you’re not handed an instruction booklet with your first paycheck.  And managing money is not a skill usually taught in the classroom or on the job.  You probably will have to learn it yourself.  Here are a few time-tested lessons that you can learn and apply to your finances, no matter what your age or financial situation:  Lost time is never found again  The earlier you start saving and investing, the more time your money has to compound and potentially earn more money.  Even if you’ve put off adding to your account or establishing a new investment plan, there’s still time.  But start at once—every day counts.  Use the time value of money in your favor*  If you begin investing $2,000 a year when you are 35 years old and earn an average annual return of eight percent in a hypothetical tax-deferred investment, by age 65, you would have accumulated $244,692 before taxes, assuming all earnings are reinvested.  Not bad, considering you would have invested a total of $60,000.  That’s the time value of money at work.  Sure and steady wins the race  It matters less where you start.  It matters more that your start.  Starting is what counts.  Saving and investing a little at a time over a long period makes achieving a large goal more manageable.  A new investment program can be started for as little as $25 a month.  You can always increase how much you invest as your income grows.  Paying yourself first can be habit forming  A painless method for regular investing is an automatic monthly investment plan that gives authorization to transfer a fixed amount every month from your checking account to an investment account of your choice.  Automatic monthly investment plans** not only provide built-in discipline, but money is invested before you even “miss it.”  If you have questions about setting up an account such as this or if you have a general insurance or investment question feel free to contact me at (866) 242-0930 or drop me a line at mbeaman@wradvisors.com.  *This is a hypothetical example and is not indicative of any past or future investments. ** These types of plans do not assume a profit and do not protect against loss in a declining market.

      These plans have been battered by the sour stock market of 2000–2002, as well as by corporate and other scandals. Despite this, employee-funded retirement plans, in one form or another, will remain a key source for building retirement assets for millions of workers. Here are some key ways to make the most of your 401(k).  1.       Join. Although 401(k) plans offer investors another way to save for retirement, participation in these plans continues to drop. According to a November 2003 survey conducted by Plansponsor, participation dropped 3.6% in 2003.  2.       Make the match. At the very least, contribute enough in your 401(k) plan to meet the minimum company match — typically three percent of salary. This is free money! Though some employers have suspended matches, most are maintaining their previous match percentages.  3.       Create an investment plan. By having clear goals, investment objectives to reach those goals, and an understanding of investment risk and your own tolerance for risk, you are less apt to get caught up in the temporary ups and downs of the market.  4.       Avoid borrowing from your plan. The first drawback from borrowing is that you will likely reduce the ultimate size of your 401(k) nest egg because you’re hurting the opportunity for the money to grow tax deferred. You also run the risk of facing taxes and penalties if you fail to repay the loan — say, due to being laid off.  5.      Don’t cash out.  Cashing out of your plan when changing jobs can result in taxes, possibly penalties, and definitely the loss of tax-deferred growth. It’s best to stay invested for the long term, to reap the benefits that 401(k) plans can potentially offer.
