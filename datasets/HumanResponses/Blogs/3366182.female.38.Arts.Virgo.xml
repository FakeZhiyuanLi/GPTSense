      The 4 tile mural I worked a week on went into the kiln,along with everything else, and thankfully everything was ok except the mural.  The underglaze was too thick, and the glaze was too thick (I decided to float glaze the tile for fear of smearing all the black.)  The glaze actually picked up the black, moved it over, and then fired in a big blob in several spots.  Live and learn.  I just don't know if I have it in me to make another one.   I'll have to dig deep for this one.  I guess I should be thinking of the kiln as half full instead of half empty!

      I'm so tired today because I was up all night worrying about the kiln firing.  It smelled something fierce, and I was worried we were all going to die of carbon monoxide poisoning in our sleep.  Plus, I kept hearing banging, which I hope wasn't anything exploding in the kiln, but I haven't found out yet because it's still 600 degrees the next day.

      I happily called the lady about the tile mural that was just set to see how great it looked.  To my suprise, she was very shocked at how warped the tiles look when set.  I was so upset I had nightmares all night and obsessed about it all day. Luckily, she called me back the next day to apologize because she was in a bad mood.  P.s.  Their check was returned the next day.

      MUST PAY SALES TAXES TODAY OR ELSE!  Something about a deadline is a sure cure to get one off one's butt.  Yesterday placed a free ad in the local paper. Cost for free, and for free stuff-This should be VERY interesting to see the response. This week I should test some cone 5 glazes just for the heck of it.

      fired the last mural.  now I'm depressed.  it's kind of like planning a wedding all year and then the day after you have nothing to do.  Not that I have nothing to do, just no one telling me what I have to do. (work orders) I could have been better prepared with a summer camp to fall into; I'm certainly getting phone calls.  But I was too sick to plan a couple of months ago."If you fail to plan, you plan to fail!"  On another note, I am regretting not buying the small test kiln.  Twice , and now three times I have lost a customer or an opportunity because I didn't have a smaller kiln to do test tiles in or cone 10, or whatever.  I will be getting one soon.

      well, the Robinson mural worked out.  4 tiles cracked or broken, all re-painted.  Hope they like them.  The Cordillera mural is getting bigger everyday, now 75 more tiles than anticipated.  They look beautiful going into the kiln.  Double stilting them for less warping.  Had a chance to teach a self-portrait class for children;one of my favorites.  This week had my second student for handmade tiles who wants to go into business as such.  After a little trepidation, I gave into the fact that I am a teacher, and so I teach.  She however wants to learn clay crafting, versus painting, so this is fun.  Got to break open my plaster, and discovered I have a love-hate relationship with plaster carving. Thought it might be easier if I colored the plaster in three after mixing the batch and pour it in layers, so you could see what you are doing. I do love pouring molds.

      I have a school painting on Monday.  For some reason I have a total mental block about the glazes.  Couldn't get the bottles I want,don't want to use the old ones.  Debating which glazes to use, the yucky cheap ones, or the nice expensive ones.  Usually, I have no choice.  I just don't want to spend any more money on half-used glazes. I have a hundred different colors, but not enough of any one to fill 12 bottles.

      Well, I got a call from the mural organizer who asked if the tiles would be ready to view tomorrow.  Of course, I hadn't even re-fired the tiles yet, or done the two "dog paw" accents, or the tile that no one wanted to paint, or the stupid 4 tile center.  So I had to fess up, and beg for more time.  Of course, now that my rear is on the line, I managed to become amazingly inspired and finish the two accent tiles while my kids got ready for school.  I cancelled a doctor's appointment, and painted the stupid center.  Not perfect and beautiful like the last one, but it's there at least.  Now the dilemma of how lazy do I want to be?  Should I leave it black and white, or color it in, and if I color it in, how much color should I bother with?  Or is it passable as it is?  Mostly, I just fear total failure like the last time.

      The great news is the mural I started working on last year, I was asking $6/tile.  At that rate I wasn't going to get anywhere, so I asked for $8/tile.  I've waited a year, and the lady felt so bad, she said they would give me $10/tile..Yippee!

      Today I need to start mixing glazes for the last tile painting for the school year.  The question is can I get 200 of the new nozzle bottles I tried out this weekend by Friday shipped and filled?  Or should I go with what I have , which now seems like crap compared.  They of course will never know the difference.  Re-painting 2 tiles that broke, refiring two broken tiles, and refiring 6" tiles that the glaze didn't flatten out all the way.  Must be done asap because they are setting this weekend, and has already been delayed once.  Guess I better start re-painting those stupid 4 part mural tiles.  Ugh!

      Today I had a glass artist over for a firing.&nbsp; It was a good excuse to do some research on fused glass.&nbsp; My&nbsp;past attempt at painted,fused, and slumped glass turned out so-so.&nbsp; I have some material already, so it would be nice to learn how to use it properly.&nbsp; She is an older woman, and I had a nice time talking about glass&nbsp;with her; how she sells her stuff (in Venezuela), and just about life as an artist.&nbsp; I custom programmed my kiln (she usually does it manually).&nbsp; It was interesting to know that you can open a red hot flaming kiln with glass inside with no breakage.&nbsp; I can't wait to see what is inside.&nbsp; Learned about cutting glass, slumping in bisque, applying enamels to gum arabic through a sifter, using elmers glue to stick shards of glass together, using a metallic sharpie to write with on glass, and firing inclusions and dichroic glass.&nbsp; Like to test frit on clay and glass.&nbsp; baking soda makes bubbles between glass (use sparingly).Use of fiber paper vs. kiln wash.&nbsp; slump at a higher temperature and fire paint at a lower temp to keep intensity of color.Use ceramic frames for drop molds (dishes)&nbsp; Cracked bisque works fine as a glass saggar!&nbsp;

      Attending NCECA in San Diego in 2003 was a turning point for me in many ways.  Little did I know when several people asked if I was going, that it was more than I could have imagined.  I went reluctantly, tired from work, but curious.  When I got there I was lost, and wandered aimlessly, not knowing what I had walked into.  I paid my $65, and set off to see what it was that everyone thought was so great.  I wandered in and out of lectures and demonstrations.  I was most interested in the business lectures, only really wanting to find a way to make a living doing what I love.  I wandered through exhibits, spying the mug sale, the cone box contest, and the k-12 children's entries.  Was my stuff up to par with the "real" teachers who had a degree?  I vowed I would enter next year, just to be competitive.(I didn't , but that's another story).  I was really excited to go to the basement area where everyone was selling everything. Tools I didn't know existed, schools beckoning (asking myself, how would my life had been different if I had majored in ceramics, and not married and had children), companies throwing samples my way by the caseloads.  Paper, paper, and more paper. The next day was better, knowing that I was there to learn as much as possible in a short time period. I sat through lectures and demos. I absorbed conversations and watched people look and watch.    When I got back home to my studio, I wasn't the same.  When I left, I was a housewife that had more than a passing interest in a hobby.  I was an entrepeneur, trying to find the holy grail that would catapault me from sometimes breaking even to supporting myself.    When I came back, I felt like an artist.  I realized I knew much more than I thought.  I realized that the real world experience I had jumped into blindly had given me more opportunity than most people get in a lifetime of study.  I saw my life 20 years from now, and 40 years from now, planning what I would like to do when the kids are grown and this season of my life had passed.  I saw myself, 70 years old, touching the clay and asking the questions......  First , when I got back to work, I was engulfed by production and exploring new avenues of business.  I taught with a new confidence, that yes, I knew what I was doing with what I did, and everything else would come later.  I experimented more, and slowly the studio became a studio, not a storefront.  I had an apprentice, and a muse.  I would spend hours with the music on, in the silent of my space, pondering the next projects, or working with ferocity.  I realized the sacrifices I had made as an artist, in my ventures as a businesswoman.  I had no extra time or energy to "create" for the sake of creating, going into the unknown with no "agenda".  I did not know what that felt like.    I closed the studio. It felt like death.  Where was my purpose without a store to support?  I hated being just a mother.  I almost couldn't do it, and didn't have to.  I had renegotiated my lease for pennies.  But I knew I had to cut off my arm for another one to grow literally.  I moved the studio to my home, like a lot of potters do.  I am lucky that I have patient people who live with me that accept the studio taking over the whole of the house.  The driveway, the garage, the courtyard, the livingroom, the office, even in the bedroom.  They know my sanity lies in it.

      recently tried a new dipping clear that unfortunately was discontinued due to lead leeching.  Won't use it on dinnerware, but, oh my god, it is beautiful.  Good thing I didn't return it to the factory like they wanted.  Wonder if they'll still sell it with a different label warning.  They should!  I will write them because they took an uneccessary beating because of the mistake.
