       I don't have air conditioning in my apartment. My friends think I'm insane, despite the fact that domestic air-conditioning was exhoribitantly expensive, and thus considered a true luxury in Israel, up until around 10 years ago. Hardly anyone here grew up with air conditioning at home, but today it's considered a necessity. Since I live in a rented apartment, in a building that is slated for demolition in a couple of years (getting permission from the municipality takes a very, very long time), the owners aren't about to invest in a unit - and I'm certainly not going to spend $1,000 to get one installed. Mostly, this is not a problem: I live in an old (and crumbling)   urlLink  Bauhaus    building with high ceilings, and my apartment doesn't get a lot of direct sunlight. Tonight, however, it's particularly hot and humid, and the air just isn't moving. The cold shower didn't help; I can't sleep.       So I'm waiting for the magic hour before dawn, when the humidity declines a bit, and meanwhile I'm reading the  urlLink New Yorker  online. I just finished Hendrik Hertzberg's very intelligent and beautifully written   urlLink  review    of Bill Clinton's memoir, "My Life." I particularly like this bit:        "...the book is shaped by political pressures and obligations. Theoretically, when a President becomes an ex-President he is freed from many of the constraints that necessarily shackled him when he was seeking office or negotiating with Congress or conducting diplomacy. But Presidential memoirs seldom take full advantage of the freedom to be frank, and Clinton’s is no exception. It is his unique and ironic fate to have a spouse who is a politician, too—one whose elective career lifted off with a roar just as his own was nearing splashdown. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, represents a state bristling with political minefields, and she will almost certainly be on every list of Presidential possibilities for several cycles to come. Her husband must therefore consider the impact on her political fortunes of everything he says, does, or writes. He might like to fire off something beastly about Israel, for example, or the Cubans in Miami, or the teachers’ unions. But he can’t. He has to watch what he says. If this is Hillary’s revenge, it is exquisite."       What can I say? I respect and admire Bill for his brilliance and charisma, and I think the Starr Report (which I read) can most kindly be described as none of anyone's business. But humiliating one's spouse in public is very uncool, and if Hertzberg's half-joking speculation is true then I say - more power (both literally and figuratively) to Hillary.

       In this week's   urlLink  Time Out Tel Aviv    there's a three page article about Toronto by one of Israel's celebrity TV chefs (and restaurant critic for Time Out Tel Aviv), Gil Hovav.   Toronto really showed up on the Israeli radar screen about a year ago, when the mass-circulation daily   urlLink  Yedioth Ahronoth    published an article announcing that Canada's largest city had become the destination of choice for emigrating Israelis. According to the article, there are now about 60,000 Israeli immigrants living in metropolitan Toronto. Based on "man on the street" interviews, it seems that most of them would have preferred to emigrate to the USA, but post-9/11 visa restrictions have made that increasingly difficult, whereas Canada is a country that has a much more open immigration policy. An oft-repeated reason for being less enthusiastic about Canada was - big surprise -  the winters. Apparently, six months of freezing temps are a major bummer. Indeed. Especially for people who are used to near-constant sunshine, 6 months of hot weather per year, and just 2 months of winter weather, when the damp and chill are sort of reminiscent of London in October.  I know Toronto pretty well, having lived there for three years in the late 1980s, and my mother and sister   urlLink  Adina    live there now. It's not the most exciting place in the world, but if you're looking for a clean, safe and pleasant place to raise children, and you're not adversely affected by long, freezing winters (followed by brief, scorching summers), then Toronto could be for you.   Peter Ustinov once described the city as "New York run by the Swiss." Torontonians took Ustinov's pronouncement as a huge compliment  - forgetting that Switzerland is generally considered one of the most boring countries in the world.  But I digress.  Here's a bit of what Hovav has to say about Toronto (in my inelegant translation from the Hebrew):  "Canadians are a more successful version of Americans - more witty, with the ability to laugh at themselves, and modest. And if you approach Toronto from the right angle, the city is a version of Manhattan that is a thousand times more human and pleasant."  Hovav goes on to tell his readers that Mercer Street is the hottest place to hang out in Toronto these days. He loves the boutique hotel   urlLink  Le Germain   , with its charming lobby and bathrooms that look like an aquarium, and staff that's "dressed a lot better than you are"; he adores   urlLink  Rain   , the Mercer Street restaurant located in a building that was formerly a women's prison - a fact "which provides a thrill for the guys who go to eat there." OK, he admits, the communal table concept is a bit tired already, but this is a *leather* table. And the open kitchen "offers an exciting performance". Gil liked the gyozo stuffed with oxtail, the pork-filled omelette [trendy secular Israelis are big on pork] and the duck cooked three different ways.  Other TO eateries recommended by Hovav: Barbarian's Steak House (Beit ha-Steyk ha-Barbari), Carousel Bakery & Sandwich Bar, Jamie Kennedie Wine Bar and Susur.  Queen Street West [a trendy street roughly equivalent to Tel Aviv's Sheinkin Street], Hovav writes, is "where you can find all the stores that sell ugly clothes to young people with ugly hairstyles, plus a few good, inexpensive restaurants, a designer chocolate shop, a fabulous shop for kitchen utensils, and most importantly (surprise!) a cute little patisserie (called Clafouti), that sells the best croissants in the city."  In other words, Gil doesn't "get" Toronto at all! His is a sort of north Tel Aviv yuppie's guide to the city, not a sophisticated insider's view. Just for starters, and as long as we're talking about food, I cannot believe that he totally ignores Chinatown, and all the great places to eat there. ('though perhaps not the eatery described   urlLink  here    by Adina's friend   urlLink  Joey   ). And how come there's not a word about little India on   urlLink  Gerrard Street   ? Last time I visited TO, my Mom and I ate the best tali I'd had since the last time I visited Natraj restaurant, in   urlLink  Udaipur   . (Actually, I think we ate there three times - in 10 days). Then there's    urlLink  Kensington Market   , where there's a huge variety of shops selling foods from all over the world, plus boutiques, clubs, cafes...   I wouldn't describe Toronto as an "edgy" city, but it has its moments - and, amusingly, the celebrity food critic and world traveler managed to miss them all.

       When you practice   urlLink  ashtanga yoga    in the   urlLink  sticky    Tel Aviv summer, you sweat a lot. After a long day of sitting in front of the computer, weeding out other people's grammatical and factual errors (grr), I was ready for a good workout at my   urlLink  regular hardcore yoga hangout   . But after 30 minutes of rapid   urlLink  sun salutations    I literally slipped on my own sweat and landed very unelegantly on my behind. (Luckily, it is well padded.)  The upside is that the heat made my muscles feel like elastic, and as a result I am delighted to report that I was able to hold  urlLink   this asana    (position) for a glorious 10 long breaths.  (okay, I know it's very un-yogic to take pride in one's practice, but let me enjoy the moment - just for tonight!)  After two hours of physical activity, and with the measly avocado sandwich I bolted down at lunch a good 8 hours behind me, I was starving. So I headed over to the sandwich bar  across the street (Ben Gurion, corner of Reines) and ordered a virtuous Greek salad, with a side of toasted rye bread. And a lot of olive oil.  I was perched on a high stool in front of the counter, chatting with a fellow yogi between bites (actually, mostly through a mouthful of food), when I saw a rather gorgeous guy (who can resist sculpted triceps and eyes the colour of robin's eggs?) order the weirdest sandwich ever. Picture this, if you can: smoked salmon with butter and mustard on rye bread, with white onion, basil and fried eggplant.   Butter  with smoked salmon? And  eggplant ? What the hell is that?!  This is what separates Israelis from non-Israeli Jews of the   urlLink  Ashkenazi    variety: no matter how far Sheldon Goldberg of New York, Toronto or Manchester may have strayed from his roots, he was  born  knowing that there is only one way to eat smoked salmon - on a bagel, with cream cheese and possibly - if you're feeling a bit adventurous -  a garnish of purple onion and/or capers. This, he will assure you, is Jewish food.  Except Israel is a melting pot, with more Jews of Middle Eastern extraction than Eastern European. So Rafi Ben David, whose grandparents were born in Rabat, doesn't know from bagels. He does, however, know all you ever wanted to know about hummous (everyone has a   urlLink  favourite place    to eat it: mine's Abu Hassan in Jaffa),   urlLink  sabich    (which takes about 5 days to digest, if you're lucky) and where to get the best   urlLink  couscous    (at his grandmother's, on Friday afternoon - after a day at the beach).  Actually, it's pretty common to make fun of Ashkenazi food here - especially   urlLink  gefilte fish   , the mention of which is usually accompanied by a mock retch. (obviously, they haven't tried my mother's).  So there you go, another perception turned "on its face": in the Jewish homeland, you can't even find a decent bagel.  Oh, by the way, here's a   urlLink  photo    of my first niece, in her father's arms.

       My sister   urlLink  Adina    suggested the name for this blog. It's a literal translation of a popular idiomatic expression in Hebrew, "al hapanim." It makes no sense in English, but in Hebrew it means, loosely, "it sucks" , "the pits", or "terrible." Example: I went to hear my favorite singer perform last night, but could hardly hear a thing because the sound system was "al hapanim."  I like the name because it says a lot about the way I perceive life and its experiences. Like the expression (which has a meaning that is very different from what one would think, based on the literal translation) most of the time things are not as they seem on the surface; if you take the time and effort to look more deeply, you'll discover - often - that the reality is very different from the way it appears "on the face of things." This is a lesson that I have never stopped learning, and it forces me to re-think my opinions constantly. Which I think is a good thing. Sort of like the Socratic concept: "The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing." Or, as a Zen Buddhist monk once told me (as I sat in the semi-lotus position, legs painfully asleep after a 45-minute meditation session), "keep your know-nothing mind"!  This idea, of things being different than they seem,  is particularly true for the country in which I live, Israel. I hope to show what I mean with little stories and anecdotes about my life in Tel Aviv. It's pretty hard to avoid the subject of politics in Israel (unless you're either very enlightened and detached, or totally unaware of your surroundings), but this is not a political blog - it's just a journal for my family and friends, and whoever else might be interested.  Here's an interesting   urlLink  article    written by a friend of   urlLink  Adina's    in the Toronto   urlLink  Globe and Mail   .  By the way, we're both very excited today -  'cause our sister Jackie - who lives in New York -  is in labour, about to give birth to our first niece, Sydney Brooke. (I've been eyeing an adorable baby outfit at one of the baby boutiques for yuppies in   urlLink  Neve Tzedek   ).

       A friend of mine who once worked as a security guard for El Al at a German airport told me the following story, about an incident which she witnessed. It happened, I believe, in the early 1990s.      A large group of German priests were on their way from Germany to Israel for a pilgrimage to the holy sites. With the exception of their group leader, also a priest, none of them spoke English. Since there was only one El Al security officer who spoke German, the wait to go through the security check was very long. The group leader broke out of the queue and approached one of the El Al staff.    The priest was angry and impatient. He complained about the long wait. He asked why El Al didn't try harder to recruit German-speaking Israelis to work for the airline in German airports. Surely it couldn't be so difficult to find a few more Israelis who speak German, now could it?      The Israeli security officer looked at the German priest and said, "What do you want? You burned them all."

       I'm quite fascinated by the international media interest in this summer's hit song   urlLink  Shirat haStickerim    (The Sticker Song), by Israeli hip hop group   urlLink  Hadag Nachash   . First   urlLink  Adina's    friend Sarah Fulford wrote   urlLink  this article    for Toronto's Globe and Mail, then the French daily Liberation published   urlLink  this article   , and now the New York Times has come out with a   urlLink  two page story    about the song.       It's certainly true that Israelis are mad about bumper stickers - which they are more likely to stick on the rear window rather than on the actual bumper. Political slogans are the most common, but there are plenty of stickers that proclaim faith in God, that admonish you to love your neighbour or be kind to animals. A couple of days ago I even saw a sticker that proclaimed "A friend of mine was killed in a car accident" - a reference to the appalling carnage on Israel's roads; with the exception of 2002-2003, when terrorist attacks were at their peak, many more Israelis are killed annually in car crashes than in bombings.      It's also undeniable that politics is a big deal in Israel. As   urlLink  Gadi Taub   , a well-known local cultural critic, says in the New York Times article, ''Israel is such a small place that taking a political position is like declaring the very core of your identity. For many years it was unthinkable for Israelis that if you're a Likud voter you could marry someone from Labor. It would be a battle over every dinner and every breakfast. So your car, too, will declare your identity. You don't think you can even make friends across bumper stickers.''      This is an interesting statement, but it's not the whole truth about Israeli society. More and more, people here are concerned about universal issues - like the environment, finding a balance between career and family demands, love, intimacy and so on. For example, a friend of mine recently told me, during a conversation about what is called in Israel "the situation" - "Listen, five years after the Nazi Holocaust ended, West Germany had an embassy in Israel. Ultimately, there will be a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians - because there is no other choice. What  really  worries me is whether my two little girls will have clean air to breathe and water to drink when they grow up."       This trend towards universal concerns is reflected in two recent Israeli films that deal with family relationships, both of which received a lot of international recognition and critical praise - Dover Koshashvili's   urlLink  Late Marriage    and Nir Bergman's   urlLink  Broken Wings   . I was living in Tokyo when Broken Wings won the prize for best film at the Tokyo film festival (in fact, I lived just up the street from the cinema where the films were shown), and I remember emailing a friend in Tel Aviv that I felt sort of...proud (of what? it wasn't my achievement!) when the winner was announced. I also remember that a couple of articles about the film insisted that it was about the Israeli search for normalcy - a statement that anyone could see was absolute nonsense. I thought it ridiculous and strange to assume that Israeli films must, simply because of their provenance, be about politics.      Okay, now I get to tell a gossipy little story that concerns Mr. Taub. A few months ago I met him at the opening of Noga Gallery's exhibit of Israeli New York-based photographer   urlLink  Elinor Carucci  's work . Taub was accompanied by a friend of mine from France who now lives in Tel Aviv, and her friend - a striking black model from Paris. The model was then in Israel to pose in a   urlLink  controversial photo shoot    for the catalogue of   urlLink  Comme il Faut   , an upscale (translation: bloody expensive) Israeli fashion house, at the separation barrier in Abu Dis.       My French friend introduced me to Gadi, and we exchanged just a couple of pleasantries; I sort of had the impression that he was more interested in talking to the model ;). Before I and my plastic wine glass could move on, however, a photographer from   urlLink  Time Out Tel Aviv    popped out of nowhere and snapped our picture. The photo was published in the next issue of the magazine, in the section called "The most interesting events of the week". There was French girl number one, French girl number two, Gadi Taub and...the border of the photo. They airbrushed me out! And thus I was deprived of my 15 minutes of fame. Ah well...

       Today a friend and I drove out to Ramle, a small mixed (Arab and Jewish) city about 30 minutes' drive from Tel Aviv, for the sole purpose of chowing down on good Indian food. The restaurant is called Maharaja, and - for those who share my passion for "the real thing" - it's located at 100 Herzl Street, near the entrance to the shuk. Maharaja is owned and operated by Indian Jews from Bombay and it's strictly no frills: with its greasy high-back upholstered benches, fluorescent lighting, formica tables, and waiters in stained white shirts, the place reminded me of a particularly grungy hole-in-the-wall I used to frequent in the seedy Pahar Ganj area of New Delhi. Except in Delhi one would not expect to see Indian men who cover their heads with crocheted yarmulkes before tucking into a nice big tali for lunch.      Our waiter, who had paan-stained teeth and henna-dyed hair, told us that he had moved to Israel (from Bombay)15 years previously, but had never really learned to speak Hebrew (actually he didn't need to tell us that; we took pity on him and switched to English almost as soon as he opened his mouth); he spoke English with that characteristic Indian lock-jaw accent that Peter Sellers imitated to hysterical effect in one of his movies (can't remember what the film was called). He (the waiter, not Peter Sellers) was convinced that my friend and I were British; when I asked him why he thought we were from the UK, he answered, "Because you are being so polite, isn't it."       We ate, and ate, and ate: saag paneer, alu gobi, iddly, hot chappattis, steamed basmati rice and vegetable pakoras; for dessert, ras malai and gulab jamun accompanied by chai masala (no milk). Then we dragged our tummies to the little grocery store in back and purchased boxes of home-made Indian sweets, bags of spicy peanuts (imported from the Old Country) and ayurvedic soap to take home. I continued automatically to speak English to the man who boxed our sweets, but stopped when I saw his look of confusion and switched back to Hebrew - which he spoke with an Israeli accent.      Anyways, I'm still digesting that meal and do not think I will ever be hungry again.       Saturday night my friend Shira and I went to an outdoor concert - one of a series sponsored by the municipality of Tel Aviv-Jaffa - in Old Jaffa. The mother-daughter duo   urlLink  Alidin    , who have gorgeous, sensual voices, sang a series of Balkan, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean folk songs to an enthusiastic audience. There was an absolutely adorable and pretty precocious 4 year old boy next to me who stood on his father's lap and danced, thrusting his hips out and pointing his fingers skyward; every so often he'd grin at me and then turn his attention back to the stage. His mother caught my eye over her son's head and rolled her eyes good-naturedly.      In addition to the concert there was a craft market just outside the Catholic church - where foreign workers can hear mass in several different languages (including Tagalog). There were also jugglers, food stands where kids could buy cotton candy and steamed corn on the cob, and mime artists. The whole atmosphere was happy and relaxed: everyone was having a good time, there was a lovely breeze from the sea, the palm fronds swayed and the restaurants were full.      The concert ended around 11:00 - early, by Tel Aviv standards. So we went to Shesek (after trying three other places where there was absolutely no standing room anywhere), a laid-back lounge bar where there's an excellent DJ and the crowd is very relaxed. We hung out until nearly 2:00 AM, but the place was still going full swing when we left - and bear in mind that Sunday is the first day of the work week.      Tel Aviv at night reminds me a lot of New York, in the sense that you're always left with the feeling that no-one has a regular job that makes it necessary to go to bed at a reasonable hour. But towards the end of my time in New York I got really sick of the "irony". Not the posing - Tel Aviv has plenty of that, and I've never been one to be put off by posers - but the endless layers of cynicism. Here people take open pleasure in simply having a good time; it's not "fashionable" to be unhappy. Quite the opposite, in fact.

       Okay, am I the only one who thinks that   urlLink  this site   , and especially   urlLink  this page    is hysterically funny? (Or   urlLink  this photo   ?) And please note that this site is   urlLink  not only for Ashkenazi Jews   ! (despite the Yiddish-influenced English transliteration of terms like "chassan" instead of "chattan" (groom)).      About a month ago I had a long conversation with an Israeli friend, who is doing his grad studies at a university in the USA, about the huge cultural gap between Israeli and non-Israeli Jews (in his case, American Jews). We agreed that there there was sufficient material there for a doctoral dissertation in sociology. And no, I will not go into a long-winded analysis of this issue now - or perhaps ever - because it's vampire time now and my brain is a bit soft.       But I'll provide two little illustrative anecdotes (discuss amongst yourselves):     I once told an American friend - a Jewish New Yorker - that "Seinfeld" is very popular in Israel. Really? he asked earnestly, Are Israelis able to understand all the subtleties of the humour in that show?    Many years ago, when I lived briefly in Jerusalem, I went to see a Woody Allen movie at a cinema - can't remember the name of the film (or the cinema), but it was the one where the protagonist (played by Woody, of course) contemplates converting to Christianity. In one scene, he unpacks a paper bag of objects he purchased - things he thinks he'll need for the conversion process. Out of the bag comes a wooden crucifix, a copy of the New Testament and...a jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. And I was the only person in the audience who laughed.     And yes, there is a connection between the first paragraph of this entry and what follows - but I'll leave that open for interpretation.

       My neighbour the sculptor shows up at the corner cafe every morning at about the same time with his two mutts, Precious and Strawberry. He orders a machiatto for himself and a chocolate cookie for each of the dogs, greets all the "regulars", downs his coffee in a couple of gulps and continues on his way. The other day I was sitting at my usual place on the bar, drinking a double espresso and reading the newspaper, when I saw the following incident take place.       As my neighbour exited the cafe, with his two very old and very harmless dogs skittering (from the sugar high, no doubt) ahead of him, three Belzer boys, aged about 10, approached from the opposite direction, on their way to school. As soon as they saw the dogs they pulled back, expressions of stark terror on their faces. The only way to circumvent Precious and Strawberry was to step off the narrow sidewalk and into the path of oncoming  urlLink insane Israeli drivers . And that is what the boys did - without looking first.      Screeching brakes, tooting horns,   etc. Children unharmed. Sculptor enraged!      He started to yell at the children: "Does it really seem logical," he asked, "to step in front of an oncoming car in order to avoid walking past two dogs? Does it? Well,  does it ?      The poor kids were white-faced and silent. They were scared of the dogs, they were scared of the alien secular (and unkosher) Jew and they were still in shock from their near-death experience. Eventually the sculptor, realizing he wasn't going to get any kind of a response, gave a disgusted snort and waved his hands dismissively in the children's direction. They made a dash for the gate to the schoolyard.      It's a strange thing, this fear the ultra-Orthodox have for dogs. At the corner grocery store I once saw a teenage ultra-Orthodox girl flinch and leap aside when old Mrs. Goldberg's little white poodle sniffed gently at her ankle. At a recent performance of the  urlLink Batsheva Dance Company , one of the dances was actually called, "Why are religious children afraid of dogs?"      It's also strange that there is a Belzer community in the middle of my heterogeneous neighbourhood of actors, musicians, artists, students, yuppies, and octogenarian Holocaust survivors. Why do they live here, instead of in Bnei Brak (and what is  urlLink this service  doing in a town that's nearly 100% ultra-Orthodox??) or Jerusalem?      A casual observer might conclude that the lack of tension between the religious and secular residents is the product of tolerance bred by the liberalism of Tel Aviv - the gay-friendly, party-loving city that never sleeps. In Jerusalem they're at each other's throats, but in Tel Aviv we all get along.       Ah, but is the  status quo  really a result of tolerance? Or is it the result of majority rules? There are more synagogues and kosher restaurants in Manhattan than there are in Tel Aviv. This is secular turf, and secular Israelis can be just as intolerant of religious Jews as the reverse. So the few ultra-Orthodox Jews live among, but apart from, the rest of the population.       They don't look at the damp, bikini-clad girls and their bare-chested boyfriends returning from the beach on Saturday morning when they're on their way home from morning prayers at the synagogue. They don't complain when my neighbour blasts a track from  urlLink Infected Mushroom's  latest CD while they're eating their Saturday afternoon  urlLink cholent . They don't respond when I greet them on the street - even though we see each other practically every day. They simply ignore us. They live in their own little bubble.       And I think the complete lack of any kind of mutual understanding is well-illustrated by the incident of the sculptor, his dogs and the Belzer kids. He was angry and hurt that anyone could shy away from his beloved mutts, didn't know that they are taught to fear them, and the kids were so afraid of the "other" (ie, bad) kind of Jew that they couldn't even work up the courage to answer him back.      *********************   Graffitti seen today on Nachlat Binyamin: "The lesson of the Holocaust: to wage war against the extreme right."      Sticker seen today above the deep fat fryer at a felafel stand: "Only love brings love."      Music I am loving: the Algerian female singer,  urlLink Souad Massi ; specifically, the album called  urlLink Raoui . A knowledge of Arabic is not necessary for understanding the emotions conveyed by Massi's astonishing voice.      Pet peeve of the day: The enormous pop-up advert for the South Beach Diet on the homepage of the  urlLink New York Times .

       His name is Meir, and he could be any age between 40 and 60. He lives in a nice building on Balfour Street, and he is the neighbourhood schizophrenic - harmless, but annoying. His illness manifests itself chiefly in nocturnal (after midnight) shouting: he likes to stand outside the 24-hour kiosk on Yehuda haLevi, near Mazeh Street, and yell in an incredibly penetrating voice, over and over, "be healthy!" According to local rumour, Meir used to be a sports announcer. If this is true, it certainly makes sense. When he shouts out "tee-hee-yee bree-yaaaa" (be healthy, addressed to a woman, with each syllable draaaaaged out) he sounds like a drugged sports announcer yelling goooooaaaaaal!      When Meir's not shouting, he asks passersby for cigarettes. Sometimes he walks into the local cafes and asks for a glass of water: if the staff is in a good mood, they give him one; if they're busy, they tell him to go away. But mostly they're kind. They give him water, offer him cigarettes. Everyone agrees that he's a " misken " (someone to pity).      I used to live just behind the 24-hour kiosk. One hot summer night Meir's shouting got so bad that I couldn't stand it any longer. Tolerance went out the window. I got out of bed, pulled a sundress over my head, thrust my feet into a pair of flip-flops and went out to confront him.       "Meir!" I shouted, "It's four o'clock in the bloody morning! Shut up already!"       He looked at me, with my wild sleep-creased hair and my raging eyes, and he said, in what can only be described as a lascivious voice, "Aaah! You are beautiful!"      The local juvenile delinquents, lounging on their mopeds and smoking Marlboros, watched the confrontation and smirked.      I turned to them and said, "You guys shut up too. I've heard you torturing him and mocking him. You're just making him worse."      Meir looked at me and asked in a hurt voice, "Yael, what have I done to you? Why don't you love me?"      I realized that I was behaving like a total idiot, trying to reason with someone who was mentally ill, a  misken . He was deep in ga-ga land, confusing me with someone named Yael. So I went home...      A year has passed since that night, but Meir's memory is long. Whenever he sees me, usually outside Gili's cafe on Rothschild Boulevard, he starts to follow me, one hand holding up his trousers, which are perpetually falling down. He holds out his free hand in a supplicating gesture, his face a mask of pleading as he cries out, over and over, "Yael, what have I done to you? Yael, why don't you love me? Yael, isn't it true that you love me?"

       Ai yai yai! After twelve hours straight of reading, editing, fact-checking, double fact-checking and dealing with the egos of terribly erudite but exhaustingly pedantic professors who think they know English better than me (you talkin' to ME?!), je suis completement crevee. (so crevee, in fact that I cannot figure out how to insert the proper accents over the "ee").       In the end I was just too tired and cranky to join friends at   urlLink  Jah-Pan   , a great club in the Florentine neighbourhood, for live music and drinks. (I must be getting old.) I just wanted to shower off the day and crash...      Dinner consisted of crackers, cottage cheese and carrot sticks (I swear, I really do know how to cook), consumed while watching the hysterical reality TV show,   urlLink  Double Date    - hosted by the ever-cynical, hyper-cool and reliably funny comic duo, Dana Modan and Ro'i Levy. The premise is this: attention-seeking guy and attention-seeking girl are set up on a three-part blind date that consists of (1) an initial meeting, (2) participation in an event planned by the show's producers (e.g., circus acrobatics, visiting a sex shop together, going hand-gliding) (3) an intimate dinner for two - usually at one of the dozens of restaurants within a 5-minute walk from where I live. The TV audience is amused by thought bubbles over the participants' heads, catty captions and special effects such as red lasers extending from the guy's eyes in the direction of his date's breasts. Dana and Ro'i provide commentary between each of the date's three stages - and man, are they mean.       The highlight of my day was the warm, funny and utterly unexpected   urlLink  letter    published today by an old friend of   urlLink  Adina's    from her days at   urlLink  Concordia University   .   urlLink  Ran    and I have never met, but Adina tells me he is a wild, cool and generous guy who is an amazing athlete and a very creative person (who is obviously a hell of a lot more adroit with Web stuff than I am). Ran was born in Israel, raised partly in Jerusalem and partly in Montreal. Today he lives with his wife, whom he married at a drive-by wedding chapel in Las Vegas, in Hong Kong. What he does there, I do not know (but I will find out).       Ran's post was in response to a letter I wrote to Adina, which she   urlLink  posted    on her blog. I hesitated a lot before linking to that letter. As I wrote in my   urlLink  first post   , this is not a political blog. It's not that politics doesn't interest me (it does); it's just that humanity (human beings and being humane) interests me a lot more.     urlLink  Ashley   , I hope you will forgive me for betraying the tacit pact of the non-political bloggers with this slight - and, I assure you, isolated - deviation!      And I hope that everyone, no matter what her opinion, will see that mine are musings on humanity - and not a political manifesto.      And now I really  must  get to bed so that I'll have enough energy for my 8:30AM yoga class.

       I know I promised to write about my neighbourhood today, but I am absolutely wiped out and must get up early tomorrow morning (ie, later this morning) to face a long day.  So be patient, dear readers - I've got lots of stories to tell and promise to write more in the next day. Or two.  Meanwhile, I offer up the following anecdote as evidence that Israel may well be on its way to becoming an enlightened country.  Today, while riding the No. 2 bus on Allenby Street, I was absolutely flabbergasted when the bus driver blew importantly into his microphone and intoned, "Will the young lady speaking on her mobile phone turn it off  immediately . Can't you see the "no mobile phones allowed" stickers right above your head? Yes, you! Look up!"  For my non-Israeli readers, here is a little context-for-comprehension:     Israel has more mobile phones than people. I'm not kidding. It's not uncommon for one person to have two mobile phones - one for work calls and one for personal calls.    I have heard phones ring at weddings, funerals, memorial services, during business meetings and during live televised interviews with VIPs.     I have been tortured by a cacophany of discordant ring tones that didn't let up for more than a minute during a 6-hour bus ride from Tel Aviv to Eilat.    I have sat at the counter of my neighbourhood cafe trying to read the morning paper, and fuming as the woman sitting next to me carries on a long - and loud - argument with her boss.    I have been on dates with men who took long personal phone calls while we were having dinner.     I guess I've made my point.    Could it be that things are changing? (oh please, let it be so).

       This morning I was awoken by the sound of pumped-up-to-the-max   urlLink  Klezmer    music. Evidently the teachers at the yeshiva elementary school across the street, which is run by the Belz   urlLink  hasidim   , had decided to give the kiddies (who, it seems, do not get a summer vacation) a morning of dancing in the playground. There they were, dressed in collared shirts buttoned to the top and tucked into dark trousers that were belted under their armpits, long sidecurls and ritual fringes bouncing as they danced wildly. The corpulent, bearded, black-clad rabbis surveyed them indulgently, no doubt as glad as their charges to have a break from the classroom.  At first it was charming, in an atavistic sort of way. I padded around my apartment barefoot, humming to vaguely familiar melodies with lyrics that varied between yai dai dai and cheeri bim cheeri bam. But after an hour I was clutching my head. Oy vey! Please, let it stop! It's too hot for all this noise!  I was saved by the  alte sachen  man.  Several times each week, an Arab guy from Jaffa appears in my neighbourhood, riding a horse-drawn cart and shouting repeatedly  in Yiddish,  "alte sachen" (old things). People lean out their windows and call out for him to come and take away their leaking refrigerators, broken-down furniture and worn-out clothes. Presumably, he sells the stuff somewhere. But why does the Arab junk collector call out in Yiddish? My theory is that the original Tel Aviv junk collectors were Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe, and the cry "alte sachen" became a sort of trademark.  Anyways, the kids at the Belz yeshiva, who do speak Yiddish,  love  the alte sachen man. As soon as they hear his cry they rush to the schoolyard gate and press their faces between the bars as they shriek out "alte sachen! alte sachen!" For kids who spend at least 8 hours per day in the classroom from the age of 4, and who aren't allowed access to television, cinema, secular literature or the physical outlet of sports, I guess this is a major source of entertainment.  So they were distracted from the klezmer music, and the rabbis, I guess, didn't see any point in continuing. They went back to the classroom and I had some peace and quiet.  More stories about my colourful neighbourhood tomorrow.  Meanwhile, for some excellent video clips that are good examples of how irreverent Israeli humour can be, click on this   urlLink  link   . My favourite is the third (and last) one down: it was filmed on Rothschild Boulevard, about 2 minutes from my apartment, at a time when suicide bombings were a very regular occurence.

       When I lived in New York, I spent a lot of money on my appearance. Don't get me wrong - I was no   urlLink  Carrie Bradshaw   : I browsed at   urlLink  Barney's   , but I didn't buy (much). Haircuts that cost "somewhere in the low three figures", regular facials, leg waxings, pedicures and expensive moisturizers were, however, a big part of my life. I was particularly brand-loyal to moisturizers - if they weren't Lancome, Dior or something equally overpriced, I wasn't interested.  This is no longer the case. Israeli salaries are relatively small; my income is about 25% of what it was in New York, but Tel Aviv is an expensive city - so-called beauty products, in particular, cost about double what they do in North America. Reality had to be faced: even for one as careless with money as I, spending 3% of one's monthly after-tax income on a jar of glamorous-smelling face cream was - obviously - ridiculously impractical.  The transition to generic moisturizers was somewhat traumatic: my mother introduced me to   urlLink  Seventeen    magazine when I was 12 years old; I graduated to   urlLink  Vogue    and   urlLink  Elle    about three years later, and by the time I reached adulthood I was completely brainwashed: all of the magazines issued regular, dire warnings about the consequences of using the "wrong" moisturizer (think reptile). So when I started to use a (relatively) cheap face cream, I examined my face in the mirror, daily and anxiously, for signs of premature aging. Incredibly, nothing happened. (although I did recently read an article about long-term consequences...)  Now whenever I need a new face cream I just ask the charming, heavy-set and heavily made-up Russian-born saleswoman at my local SuperPharm (Shopper's Drug Mart, for my Canadian readers) one blunt question: what's on sale today?  But here's the strangest thing about making a purchase at SuperPharm: the wait at the cashier. It's almost always long, but no-one pushes or complains. This, in a country where impatience is the rule; where pushing and shoving are the norm. This, in a country where the driver behind you honks if you haven't shifted from neutral to first within a nanosecond of the traffic light turning from red to orange (before green). At SuperPharm, people wait their turn without making a fuss. Meanwhile, I am the one rolling my eyes, sighing and shifting my weight from one foot to the other.  The cashier starts by asking if you have a Lifestyle card (a credit card issued by SuperPharm that entitles you to various special offers). No? Would you like to apply for a Lifestyle card? No. "Since your purchases total more than 200 shekels, you can buy a beach blanket for an additional 10 shekels. Are you interested?" Hmm, says the customer. Let me see that beach blanket. Do you have it in any other colours? No? Then I'm not interested. Any other special offers? "Yes," says the cashier, "for 15 shekels you can purchase a set of suntanning products." Again, the customer must examine and consider the product. Sometimes this goes on for several minutes. (I swear.) And when you finally go to pay, the cashier asks sweetly if you would like to donate 10 shekels to the Israeli Cancer Society (no).  Once I tried to pre-empt the process with a typical New Yorker's impatient attitude. I placed my items on the counter and, before she could open her mouth, smiled with dangerous politeness and said, "I'm not interested in any of the special offers."  She looked at me as if I were just the most uncouth person on earth.  Can anyone explain this weird cultural anomaly to me?
