        I thought I better get on this band wagon...everyone I know seems to have a Blog or an online journal or something. So I thought I would check it out...see how this works. So it should be interesting to see what exactly I decide to post on this. How much do I really want to share...hehehe...evil and sinister laugh. A little mystery never hurt anyone.

       urlLink  http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail109.html     One of the best!       Things have been a little crazy around the Martini household. We've been moving, and you know how much fun that can be. So needless to say, I feel a little "off." Hopefully that SB email will entertain you so that I can get my head on straight and blog more later today. Ugh...back to boxes.

        I don't know about you but I have never liked the word, "ordinary." It always is said with such a poor connotation. In fact, I still think if I ever heard "ordinary" used as a word to describe me I would be devastated and feel put down. I have never wanted to be predictable or boring or average. Maybe that's why I live my life the way I do; everyone always tells me I have a flair for the dramatic, but I would say that instead I am very...passionate! Actually, if I am being honest here, I think the truth is that I just attract drama in every aspect of my life. I wouldn't call myself a "drama queen" although I am sure others would disagree. Anyway, I'm derailing. The point is that I have never wanted to have a life that is just...blah. Does anyone really?       But my reading today in the Rabbi's Heartbeat rocked that perspective. B. Manning shares a story about an average guy named John Eagan who lived an extraordinary life of prayer and humility. Honestly, this wasn't a guy who's life I would want to live. He was a school teacher, had a wife and a house; he never did anything exciting or extremely adventurous. He just was a guy who was passionately in love with Jesus. He would take these 8 day spiritual retreats every year and meet with his mentor and spend time in solitude, prayer and silence (...something I am now considering making a practice of mine as well. Doesn't that sound refreshing? Right, derailing again). One year his mentor said this to him: " the heart of it is this: to make the Lord and his immense love for you constitutive of your personal worth.  Define yourself radically as one beloved of God.  God's love for you and his choice of you constitute your worth. Accept that, and let it become the most important thing in your life."  This has been a strange thing for me to think about today. The world tells us that we are the sum of our experiences, our relationships, our possessions, our talents and achievements, our reputation. To think that God looks at us and sees NONE of that scares me a little. What does God see when he sees us? He sees his child, one that he loves. Again I feel exposed and insecure. Am I really enough when that's all that's left? Words of a song come to mind:  " I am nothing  yet you bid me come to you, Lord Almighty. As I come I'm overwhelmed with you."  What I am beginning to understand and try to grasp is that being ordinary is extraordinary before the God that created us just as we are, who knitted us together in our mothers' wombs, who knows how many hairs we have on our heads and what thoughts we have in our heads. That in itself is extraordinary!      B. Manning writes,  "While the imposter draws his identity from past achievements and the adulation of other, the true self claims identity in its belovedness. We encounter God in the ordinaries of life: not in the search for spiritual highs and the extraordinary mystical experiences but in our simple presence in life. God created us for union with himself. This is the original purpose of our lives. And God is defined as love (1 John 4:16)...Being the beloved is our identity, it is the core of our existence...when I draw life and meaning from any other source than by belovedness, I am spiritually dead ..." I am truly nothing when deterred from the core of my existence, the true purpose of my being, to be in relationship with God. I wonder sometimes if we spend all our attention and energy in trying to figure out "who we are" that we forget the most important part of what makes us. I know that is the LAST thing I think of when I try to define who I am. Instead of feeling shameful and embarrassed of being "ordinary" I need to embrace that I  am  and make that which defines and makes me extraordinary, not my adventures, relationships, achievements, possessions, reputation, etc. Everything else that I may try to define myself with is an illusion. All that will eventually fade and deteriorate anyway. In my weakness, in my brokenness and selfishness, pridefulness and powerlessness, identity is first found in Abba's love for this ordinary kid; the rest will follow.     "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added..."         Side note; just watched "The Good Girl" with Jennifer Aniston. For a person who already is feeling overwhelmed with all this "stuff" it wasn't the best movie to watch, but if you are in the mood for a good movie that really makes you think about what can happen in "ordinary/blah" phases of our lives, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. I just think I should have watched it maybe at a different place in my life. Oh well; signing off.

       *just a random question. I would like to get your thoughts: God created us to be emotional people with a myriad of emotions and feelings; and psychologists and self-help books tell us that our feelings are 100% valid and never "wrong." So when does a feeling become a sin?? Your thoughts?*     Today's chapter in the Rabbi's Heartbeat was a difficult one for me to put into words. Some of this I feel like I am repeating over and over again with the same conclusions. What struck me this morning is this thought from Thomas Merton:  "a life devoted to the shadow is a life of sin."  Even though we try to live in the shadow and hide our secret sins thinking we are freeing ourselves from a world of hurt and rejection, it is just as much a sin to live an inauthentic and disillusioned life because it pulls us away from our intimacy with God and the body of Christ in community. Whether or not I like that, it's the truth and I feel it deeply.        "When we accept the truth of what we really are and surrender it to Jesus Christ, we are enveloped in peace, whether or not we feel ourselves to be at peace. By that I mean the peace that passes understanding is not a subjective sensation of peace; if we are in Christ, we are in peace even when we feel no peace." -B. Manning.          Surrender. Surrending to come out of the darkness of sin and into the light of life and truth can hurt. It may take some time for our eyes to become adjusted and not blinded by the brightness. But like Brennan Manning said, the more time you stay in the light, in the presence of Jesus, the more you enjoy it and more you discover that He is more than enough and more than worthy to take off our masks or show our faces and  "delight in the discovery of what it means to live by grace and not performance."  There is freedom in that discovery! There is complete joy in that revelation!

       I had this boyfriend at the very young and naive age of 17 who I was enamored with. From what I knew of love at the time, that was it. The world was perfect when I was with him and my life ceased to have any meaning when I wasn't. Ok, I  now  understand that I was being completely co-dependent and was in a VERY unhealthy relationship, but even though my parents and friends had been telling me that all along, I believed I was in love and that's all that mattered to me at the time. He was much older than me and, at times, I felt totally lost being with him. We would sit together in the early hours of the morning at his favorite tiny Irish pub in downtown Salt Lake City (I'm totally killing my dad right now; hang in there, Dad! It's going to be ok...he's totally freaking out right now. I know cuz he called!) over a pitcher of Guinness. I would listen to him for hours while he wove these beautiful stories together of the adventures he been on around the world; the smoke from his cigarette would curl over his face and fill the dark and musty room. He would share his thoughts about politics, philosophy, the arts and theology and I would just listen, a wide-eyed child who was completely intoxicated with him, and probably a little of the Guinness too. But even to this day, I can't tell you what he would say. I have no recollection about any point he made, any story he told...the only thing I remember was the feeling of complete inadequacy when I was around him. I don't that was ever his intention. In fact, I believe at times I was fulfilling exactly what he wanted and needed, someone who would just listen to him. I never went home feeling refreshed; instead I would close my eyes at night thinking about what I could do to engage in better conversation with him, what books I could read, what movies I could watch, etc. I was in constant pursual of making myself better so that he would like me more and keep me around longer, afraid of being "found out" and not wanting to be rejected. (Please refer to previous point made: I KNOW this was an unhealthy, co-dependent relationship, just to make that clear folks!) I wish I would have just enjoyed that time for what it was and not tainted it with my silly insecurities or co-dependency; maybe then I could look back on it with fondness.       I think that's what I do in my relationship with God. I focus so much of my time and energy trying to "people-please" God by reading all the right stuff and saying all the right things as if that will make him love me more. I memorize verses, do quiet times, fast, pray, journal. I buy Christian music and wear Christian t-shirts. I go to church every weekend and community group every week. I am a Christian leader to high school students and sing and play with the worship band. And if done for the right reasons, those are good things, very good things. Please understand that I am not knocking any of that. But if I do it for the purpose of trying to please God, make him "like me more" or "keep me around longer" I have missed the point. I think sometimes we (although we may not consciously think it or say it out loud) act as if God has a tally sheet up in heaven and that he's keeping score of every little thing we do. If that's the truth, I think we have a VERY different idea of what God's keeping "score" of. Just like my relationship with that boyfriend, I think sometimes we lay in bed at night thinking about what we can do better or not do instead of thinking about how we can fall more in love with our Savior. We fall asleep without feeling refreshed in our relationship with the Lord; instead we feel inadequate and completely insecure about who we are in him. When am I, when are you, going to let that go and allow ourselves to be completely intoxicated with him? When will I, when will you, just allow ourselves to sit in his presence as wide-eyed children and just listen? No, we are not perfect and we never will be. Yes, spiritual disciplines are good and very important. Yes, there is a time and a place for confession and acceptance of our sin. But I pray that I will be able to learn how to enjoy the time shared with him instead of wasting precious time dabbling in insecurity and "people pleasing" when he loves me just the way I am and won't love me more because I have read a certain book or watched a certain movie. I think that will help me fall more in love with Jesus and feel the freedom of his unending love for me.     on a lighter note...another quiz. Told you!

         Some things to think about:       "Without your wounds, where would your power be? ...In love's service, only wounded soldiers can serve." -Thornton Wilder            "Measure your life by loss instead of gain     Not by the wine drunk, but by the wine poured forth     For love's strength standeth in love's sacrifice     And whosoever suffereth most hath most to give." -Hudson Taylor          "These persons have had their lives laid bare and pushed to the brink of destruction by alcoholism and it's accompanying problems. When these persons arise from the ashes of the hellfire of addictive bondage, they have an understanding, sensitivity, and willingness to enter into and maintain healing encounters with their fellow alcoholics. In this encounter they cannot and will not permit themsevles to forget their brokenness and vulnerability. Their wounds are acknowledged, accepted and kept visible. Futher, their wounds are used to illuminate and stabilize their own lives while they work to bring the healing of sobriety to their alcoholic brothers and sisters, and sometimes to their sons and daughters. The effectiveness of AA's members in the care and treatment of their fellow alcoholics is one of the great success stories of our time, and graphically illustrates the power of wounds, when used creatively, to lighten the burden of pain and suffering." -Psychiatrist James Knight on AA         I have always known that God allows brokenness in our lives to transform us into the person he created to be. I have pretty much always understood that He is concerned about our heart, not our circumstances, and would go to any length to make sure that he captures us in relationship, whether through the death on a cross of his only son or through allowing our lives to be shattered in pieces so that we come sprinting back to him. But, I never really thought about God using that brokenness to "heal" others wounds. Yes, I have seen the way that those who have gone through some similar life altering experience can offer a more sensitive and sympathetic heart to those who are hurting...but actually be used as a tool of healing the wounded? Woah. Maybe our brokenness isn't for us after all, or at least not entirely. Puts a different kind of spin on it for me. I am always get caught up in this ego-centric mindset  "it's all about ME"  when going through brokenness, what God is doing in  my  life, what  I  have been learning, what devastating times  I  am going through...and yes, I am sure that is all happening too. But what if God designed brokenness to be a training ground to help us become better physicians to others who are hurting and needing a healing, loving touch? If you look over scripture, it is the completely broken, sinful and "useless" people that he uses to do great things: Moses (murderer, stuttering problem but brought Israel out of Egypt), Abraham (liar, coward, had little faith but father of all nations), Paul (persecuted hundreds of Christians but spread the gospel in a great part of eastern Europe), David (adulterer, murderer but sent his son through his blood line)...God really does have this incredible track record of using the most insignificant people to accomplish his plans of healing and restoration with his people whom he loves so deeply. Maybe that's why he uses me and you.         Abba, you are the Great Physician. Please heal my heart and use me to help in your healing of those who are hurting and need you. Make me a broken vessel and pour out through me. I love you. Amen.

       For those of you who don't know, I am a HUGE Tori Amos fan and have been since I was 13. Some people think she's a man-hater but I totally disagree. She's an amazing musician and honest poet, and if you have ever seen her perform, you would be totally blown away. Anyway, enough defending my obsession. I was running today and thinking about all the stuff I have been reading and writing about lately: brokenness, identity, transparency, honesty...and this song, "girl," popped in my head:    From in the shadow she calls   And in the shadow she finds a way   And in the shadow she crawls   Clutching her faded photograph   My image under her thumb   Yes with a message for my heart   She's been everybody else's girl   Maybe one day she'll be her own   Everybody else's girl   Maybe one day she'll be her own   And in the doorway they stay and laugh as violins fill with water   Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away   Well I'm not seventeen but I've cuts on my knees   Falling down as the winter takes one more cherry tree   She's been everybody else's girl   Maybe one day she'll be her own   Rushin' rivers thread so thin limitation   Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue and the drugstores too safe in their coats   And in their do's yeah smother in our hearts   A pillow to my dots    One day maybe one day one day she'll be her own   And in the mist there she rides    And castles are burning in my heart   And as I twist I hold tight   And I ride to work every morning   Wondering why "Sit in the chair and be good now" and become all that they told you   The white coats enter her room   And I'm callin' my baby Callin' my baby Callin' my baby Callin'    Everybody else's girl   Maybe one day she'll be her own    There's a lot to this song. Something that sticks out in my mind is something my mentor said to me over a cup a coffee a while back: "Who are you if you were to strip away all that you do (ie, "I'm a youth pastor, I'm a student, etc.") or all your relationships (ie, "I'm a mom, I'm so-in-so's son, etc.)...who is left when all that is gone?" Um, I don't know about you, but that thought is a little frightening. Maybe one day...

      Ok...so as cheesy as this may sound, I just saw  The Village  with Brian, Justin and Aaron and although yes, it was pretty lame, there was something in that movie that caught my attention immediately. This whole idea of having a "black box" in which you put all your secrets, lock them up, and never allow ANYONE to look in intrigues me. I don't want to ruin the movie for all of you who are dying to see it, but (without giving away all the mindboggling twists throughout the movie; notice the dripping sarcasm) the characters in this movie all have these horrible experiences and instead of dealing with the issue and accepting it, they pick up and create this alternate reality, shoving all their "dirty little secrets" in a black box and sticking it in the corner. Yeah, I think we've discovered a new wave of counseling people! And I'm coining this one! How bout it? I mean, think about it...you're sitting at home over a glass of wine with some friends over for the evening. Suddenly someone notices the "box that won't be named" in the corner and asks, "So, I heard that you've been caught drunk in a bar several times this week, John..." "SHHH!" you reply. "THAT'S IN THE BOX! WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE THINGS IN THE BOX!" and then quickly change the subject with a sip of wine and a slight smile. How freeing would that be! Ok, please understand that I am totally kidding here, but really, don't we try to do that anyway? I have a black box in the corner of my living room. I take it out sometimes for rememberance sake and then try to lock it up again before anyone can see. And although I am trying to unpack it for good and reveal the contents, it's terrifying at times. Let's be honest...Don't you have a box too?  Oh, and one more thing, on a lighter note...check this out:  urlLink http://www.no-nothingrock.com/articles/daler/  and click on the TUNAK TUNAK TAN link. I laughed so hard, a little bit of pee snuck out!   "your life will be changed. you will dance. you will dance like you've never danced in your life."   ....lol, I'm still laughing.

       Apparently I am reading a great author for where I'm at on this journey in my life with brokenness (according to "the Mighty" Mike DeVries! hahaha, he hates that!) which is comforting to hear. It's amazing to me to think of Brennan Manning's story and see how God has taken him, reshaped and formed this shadow of a man and allowed him to become a vessel of God's love and acceptance through his own brokenness and sin in his life...I wonder if He'd do that with me.  My friend, Kelly, made a good point on his last blog entry that radiates in my own study time today: why is it, that when we sin, we get so focused on the sin that we constantly dwell on it? It consumes us. We enter into this deep cycle of self-destructive thoughts and unending guilt. I believe that was the main reason I entered into the pagan life I did when I was 17; I was tired of feeling guilty all the time for all the sin in my life and the sin I know I would come into at some point and couldn't avoid. The knowledge that I would never be perfect poisoned my heart and made me believe that I was unworthy to even pretend to live in blood of Jesus. So why not just detach from the feelings of guilt? Why follow a God who would just tell you you were "bad" all the time?  Why do we choose to believe that when God so clearly says we are forgiven, that our sins are as far as east from west, that we are made "white as snow"? B. Manning writes,  "One of the most shocking contradictions in the American church is the intesnse dislike many disciples of Jesus have for themselves."  Yeah. I can see that. I really don't know many people who genuinely like every piece of who they are. And why would we? We are all liars, betrayers, selfish, greedy, prideful, lustful...we create these outward images for others to see and that we try to maintain at all costs so that no one can see and judge who we really are. But that's not what the Lord sees when He sees us. He still sees His child, His beloved, His creation...and He still loves us, sin and all. As I think about the story of the prodigal son today, tears pour from my eyes. The father didn't sit at the door with a list of his son's wrong doings. He didn't even mention them. Instead, he RAN, completely undignified and unashamed, toward his beloved son to embrace him. The son felt unclean, unworthy. He was tired, smelled of pigs and had nothing left to give. But still the father loved and forgave him...I am that son.      "A bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out until he leads justice to victory..." Matthew 12:20/Isaiah 42:3        I am a bruised reed right now...but He will not crush me. I am a smoldering wick even now...but He will not quench it. I am in a safe place...I am loved. I am forgiven.       "Abba, thank you for loving me even in my lsin and brokenness. Thank you for calling my your child JUST AS I AM. Draw me ever closer to your loving arms even when I push away and protest that I am not worthy. Thank you for running to great me even as I finally turn toward home. Amen."

          "Surrender your poverty and acknowledge your nothingness to the Lord. Whether you understand it or not, God loves you, is present in you, lives in you, dwells in you, calls you, saves you and offers you an undestanding and compassion which are like nothing you have ever found in a book or heard in a sermon."   -Thomas Merton, The Hidden Ground of Love      I have been coming to understand some things about myself lately that are not easy to accept. Maybe I always knew they were there, but as of late, they have been rearing their ugly head. I feel unloveable, unacceptable, unforgiveable...completely exposed. I feel a little like the woman caught in adultry, thrown at Jesus' feet, and awaiting the first stone.         "Woman, where are your accusers? Does no one condemn you?...Neither do I. Go on your way, and sin no more..."         I am nothing to deserve such love. I don't understand it, and certainly don't believe I will ever come to. I will, however, embrace it wholeheartedly and fall into the breast of my Savior, my beloved, and listen to his heartbeat.  Lord, may I never take your gift of love lightly. May I understand what it means to sink it in and be still in it.

        This cracks me up. I took a personality test on line this morning. Here it is:    Big Five Test Results  Extroverted 90%, Introverted 10%, Friendly 70%, Aggressive 30%, Orderly 68%, Disorderly 32%, Relaxed 36%, Emotional 64%, Openminded 78%, Closeminded 22%     Extroversion  results were very high which suggests you are extremely talkative, optimistic, sociable and affectionate but probably  not very internally grounded.   Friendliness  results were high which suggests you are very good natured, trusting, and helpful  but possibly too agreeable   Orderliness  results were moderately high which suggests you are organized, reliable, neat, and ambitious but possibly not very spontaneous and fun.  Emotional Stability  results were moderately low which suggests you are worrying, insecure, emotional, and nervous.  Openmindedness  results were high which suggests you are very intellectual, curious, imaginative  but possibly not very practical .    Emotional Stability...what's that? Lol, that's funny...Most of that is pretty true. That's scarey. Although I would think that I am spontaneous and fun. At least fun! I have said this to my friend Justin quite frequently...with a personality like that, WHY DO YOU HANG OUT WITH ME!

          "This is the crisis that we're in: God-light streamed into the world, but men and women everywhere ran for the darkness. They went for the darkness because they were not really interested in pleasing God. Everyone who makes a practice of doing evil, addicted to denial and illusion, hates God-light and won't come near it, fearing a painful exposure. But anyone working and living in truth and reality welcomes God-light so the work can be seen for the God-work is it."          May we radically throw ourselves into the light and escape the prison of hiding well in the darkness.

        Reading "The Rabbi's Heartbeat" by B. Manning. Nathan just "happened" to leave it at my house...nice hint, huh? It is definitely going to be an adventure reading this book. I have a feeling I am about to get knocked around a bit, especially in this time of transition in my life. First chapter...Safe. Here's a quote:       "Living out of the false self creates a compulsive desire to present a perfect image to the public so that everybody will admire us and nobody will know us."        isn't that the truth. As I think about the circle of my relationships, it's scary to think about who REALLY knows me. Some say that I am predictable, and although some of that may be true, I think what's the most frightening to me is thinking about the things here in my head that no one knows...they might take back their words. The thoughts that constantly go unsaid for fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of pissing someone off...I don't know if anyone really knows me. Is that what safe means? Being so protected by your supposed public self image that no one knows you enough to reject you? Like the book said, Adam and Eve hid and yet we...Thousands of years later, do the EXACT same thing and hide from everyone, including God and ourselves! Why do we hide?        "We either flee our own reality or manufacture a false self which is mostly admirable, mildly prepossessing, and superficially happy. We hide what we know or feel ourselves to be (which we assume to be unacceptable and unlovable) behind some kind of appearance which we hope will be more pleasing. We hide behind pretty faces, which we put on for the benefit of our public. And in time we may even forget that we are hiding, and think that our assumed pretty face is what we really look like..."       I hide, all the time. If anyone knew what I was really like, would they still love me? If I shared what was in my heart for the last 6 years of my life would I still be "respected" as I am? Would I still be offered ministry positions with people I love and respect? Would students want me to mentor them? I hide...I hide all the time. And I am beginning to hate the persona I hide behind. It's exhausting. And it enslaves me. How do you get to the place of acceptance of that hiding and come out of it into a life of transparency? God says he loves me. He says that he loves me despite all the masks I put on or the part I perform for everyone else, including those closest to me. He calls me out of that place of hiding and wants to embrace me for who I am, scars, wounds, disfiguration, disease and all. He wants me to run to him and accept his gift of salvation, grace and love. How can I do that and still feel safe?        "To feel safe is to stop living in my head and sink down into my heart and feel liked and accepted...not having to hide anymore and distract myself...staying in the present moment and not escaping into the past or projecting into the future, alert and attentive to the now...feeling relaxed and not nervous or jittery...Unselfconscious...no need to impress or dazzle others or draw attention to myself...loved and valued, just being together as an end to itself."          Lord, may I have an understanding of what it means to be safe in you, not in myself or in others, a position, a quality or talent...but in you and you alone so that I can come out of the bushes and into the light where your love, forgiveness, acceptance and grace are ready to come pour over me. Thank you for loving me, disgusting, scarred, diseased, and wounded, just as I am.            "I shall be happy to make my weakness my special boast that the power of Christ may stay over me." 2 Cor. 12:9

       urlLink     Woman in chains...   I hate this picture. Why is it that no matter how many times I hear that in Christ there is freedom, in him is peace, I have been set free through Jesus' sacrifice...why is it, that none of that makes sense to me? Why does it still feel like I am chained to something unseen? Will there ever be true freedom? Will there ever be real peace?
