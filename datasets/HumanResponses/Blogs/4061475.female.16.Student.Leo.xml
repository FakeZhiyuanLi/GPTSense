      Yep thats where me and mom should be today. Wait a minute I didn't even sleep last night! But it's turning out to be just one of those days. Went to work for 2 hours and got put on a tour, I wasn't even in uniform, and "g'day folks welcome to the Bonnechere Caves!" So, needless to say, I'm a little pre-occupied with the singing and the talking to people who don't speak english (they speak french), and I hope that that tour raked in some tips. lol. Anyways going to return movie. Watched Starsky and Hutch and it was disappointing. Then Anything Else, except it was too boring.

      Whenever you really want something and you're ready to have it, it never comes along. You'll wait for it for a long time and it still never comes. Maybe we shouldn't wait for it along, maybe we should just get used to live life without it, and then when it does come we can enjoy it to the fullest, and finally let it be a surprise!

       Yes the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off due to budget cuts... The only thing that is getting me through to my next day is that a) it'll be friday b) it's my day off c) no tourists d)I'll be going to the movies and e) I'm going to be getting sleep. That and I'll be seeing the dentist soon so I can get rid of this stupid toothache. Finished my book today. Oryx and Crake, and it was really good but the ending didn't make much sense. But to tell you the honest truth Margaret Atwood never really did make much sense. But thats beside the point. Anyways I say read the book it's really good. but don't expect the end to make anything clearer. Anyways I am one tired chicky so I'm heading to bed.

      If only.....  yeah lol, cousin is here! lol Hooray for Michelle! Yeah and besides the fact that Chris emailed me and said that he may not have the time to see me, well boo to him. But at least he's trying. Then my co-worker Chris has seemed to move on, and the only fear that we're having right now is that I'll be next. GOOD GOD SAVE ME NOW!!!! But other then that screwed up some squres this morning.(damnit) oh well, they'll still be good (I hope).Good bye
