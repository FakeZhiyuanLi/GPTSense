        So I finally wrapped up all momentos, trinkets, jagged shards of the broken window, that type of thing.  All the cute letters and cards, the black lacey number, etc...      I ritualized it.  Rituals are important in all of our lives, whether we realize it or not.  Its all those habits we enact to make the dull more tolerable.  Once we make things in order, and logical, we can map our progress.  We all have the ability to bundle things up in tiny bite-size pieces, thus making this crazy chaotic world edible, if only for a short time.    First I gathered a length of twine.  Then into the study drawer to retrieve some tape and a pair of scissors.  Then came the music.  Something atmospheric and "cleansing" in its message.  Into two shoeboxes went everything.  Neatly folded when made into cloth, emotionally chronological when in print.  The yo-yo, little rubber duck and only the epic abstract photographs then lined the sides.  They were then wrapped neatly into wrapping paper made out of old Daily News'.  Ironically, the front side of the larger of the two boxes stated boldly from its sports page:  "In Your Face".   Then neat bows were tied atop w/ the string.     Deciding not to wear the sneakers she gave me, I've been wearing them too much anyway, I decided to bring out the real shoes.  After a long period of returning them to their black lustre, while deep breathing at the same time, I left.  This is a 2 bus ride, and it sounds ridiculous but I wouldn't have gone through this if I didn't have to go to the bank anyway.  Unfortunately I opened a bank account close to her residence, mostly due to the undending love I thought we had, and because of the time we were spending with each other then.    Sleek leather jacket, sunglasses, and I was off.  Hoping not to catch her playing hooky and banging somebody, I quietly opened the door with the key she had given me at one time.  Up to the top floor, I neatly left the package in front of the door, dropped the key in the bag and left, ringing the bell on the way out just in case, because I would never have the need to open that door again.    Since then, since the absence of that black, cancerous package out from my sight, my energy has raised, and it usually takes a lot for me to say that.  I'm purposely drying out the wet mush that was my pathetic existence.  I matter, my goddamn spine matters and I'm better than her anyway.  I live purely now.  Plenty of water, reading, and connection.  Writing, meditation, and eating.  Quiet, reflective building.  When completed, this tower will be visible from any point in the universe, as was originally intended.  I lost my way in a false love.

        Yeah, roses really smell like poo-oo-ooh.  Tonight, after many a beer and positive social reinforcement, I've finally arrived from tonight's Mets game.  Don't mean to overly tout the Mets, one of the easiest teams to make fun of me for liking, but tonight had to be the absolute best Mets performance I've had the pleasure of seeing.  Better than the games I've seen with the lying whore I used to go out with.  Obviously, they started losing in the first inning (these guys don't waste any time, trust me).  Then, after a bathroom break and yet another Budweiser (they taste better @ the stadium for some reason) and one of my many bathroom breaks, (I've got what I jokingly refer to as "the crazy bladder" due to my back problem.  Cliff Floyd (southpaw as I am), hits what would at first glance only be a line drive.  Only this m-er f-er carried like a son of a bitch and hit the chevrolet sign, cutting the Cardinals lead to 4-3.  Don't get me wrong here, I'm no sports nut by any means, I only feel (my downfall), and through emotion I end up being able to concentrate on 1 thing at a time.    After of course thinking about how evil Jill must be, how her legs must simultaneously be up in the air as I'm screaming my lungs out, inning after inning passed, leaving me to my tortuous pit-like cell of a trapping mind.  Then, before I know it, the bottom of the ninth arrived, with the Mets losing.  Not a surprise when you go to a Mets game, FYI.  All of a sudden 2 batters are walked, then Kaz Matsui, the other white Matsui meat, breaks his bat, tying the game.  Cliff Floyd is back in the picture, strong and silent, unaffected by horrible heart breaking evil bitches (ok, I'm mentioning my own pain again).  He hits the single that wins the game.  After sticking out so many games where everyone leaves after they stop selling alcohol (7th inning), I was redeemed in a way. Crazy crowd, lots of energy, just the way I like it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Other than all that, there is something else I can't get off my mind.  As I mentioned recently, I started the painful process of packing up any momentos or remnants of Jill I have left, some going back years.  Does this only bother me because I'm young?  I think not.  I've always been far ahead of my peers, almost always resulting as a crutch, both socially, and in terms of finding anything real in this life.  These were the most important, reflective items I've held close to me all the time I've known her.    Inside two recently used shoeboxes I neatly and ritualistically packed everything into them.  In order, maybe trying to trigger some kind of mental path inside her cold evil soul.  My plan was to deliver them to her home, hopefully at at time when she wouldn't be there.    So there I was, shirtless, somewhat drunk, and listening to Tool, my favorite band, hoping for some kind of therapeutic thing.  Once the goosebumps rose, I went to work.  Letters, lacy black numbers, panties, and other artifacts she left by my place were folded neatly, in order and packed.  Then they were wrapped up neatly in newspaper and tied up, soon to be at her door relieving me of the pulsing black evil that emnates from the box sitting in my room.  It'll all be over soon.

         Con-GAY-tulations!!  -Beginning at 12:01 this morning, couples in Mass. were officially legally allowed to wed.  Thousands of well wishers crowded outside to cheer the happy new couples, some eagerly awaiting their vouchers for their own unions planned for this week.    Not So Free De-LIVERY  -Starting today for the hundreds of too cool to be straphangers or even yellow cab takers, commuters who travel this lovely city on their way to work using livery cabs will today have to face a $1 increase on the base fare.  After also voting for the first time in the Dominican election from New York, the head of the NY taxi commision Fernando Mateo, said "Drivers work hard for their families and children, and, in the face of increasing operating and living costs, this fare hike is not a luxury but a necessity."     "And the Rocket's Red Glare.."  - 1 strike away from defeat, Mike Piazza's bomb bursted in air at the top of the ninth, ruining Roger Clemen's bid at being what he is best - an asshole.  Striking out 10 Mets and giving up no runs in his performance, Piazza erased a 2 nothing lead with one swing.      font-size:24px; "Shock and awe, baby,"  was what Tom Glavine shouted out after the game, which went to 13 innings, and was finally sealed with a home run from drier than a well in hell-Jason Phillips.  Even after striking out 16 times during the game, and Art Howe being ejected by what can only be described by this Mets fan as an "evil call", those funky-Flushingites proved that the Empire doesn't always strike back, no matter what team they move to.    .

        This new stream of imagery is scary, overwhelming but so powerful.  I don't think it as a predicting force, probably too early to tell.  I had the most bizarre dream last night.  Seemed as if it took 12 hours to pass, and it was ripe with symbolism.  A full description of the dream is at the end of this entry.    Right now I'm listening to the Smashing Pumpkins, a band I can now respect and appreciate for what they are.  This comes from a long attachment to a girl, and her unhealthy obsession with the band.  She dumped me about what must be a month now.  I know I should be mature, and it sounds stupid to just say "she was the one" but we were supposed to marry.  We lost our virginity to each other (at least I lost mine to her).  We worked through all the tough things a couple could go through, and I was under the impression the establishment of a real bond, tough and new and unlike the weakness of my parents marriage, had occured.  I was wrong.  I was caught off guard.  I was so fucking supportive of her, proud of her, watched her develop into the swan she (at least was) to me today.  I loved her more than anything, I wanted to have her babies.  And I used to hate little kids.    I remember it as if it was yesterday.......(memory sequence now- Wayne's World - doodaladoo, doodaladoo)    It was Valentine's Day, 1995.  Nic Cruz, awkward freshman at Bayside High, 14 years old and already lovingly known as "bulbous", due to the bulbous nature of my huge head, has just gotten off the bus, coming back from a disappointing encounter with what was my first real girlfriend ever, also her birthday.  You see I've already seen Jill here and there, she was already a sophomore, and as we all know, the older woman allure was very taboo in high school society.  I had a crush, more like an odd feeling whenever I saw her or heard her speak, since I really didn't know anything about her.  I never dared speak to her though.      On this sunny day, I was walking through the park right across the street, in deep thought as unfortunately I am most of the time.  Thats when she came into view over the hill.  She was revealed slowly, as if a curtain were raising.  Thats when I saw her.  She was leaning against the black, cast iron fence that surrounded the school.  She had on one of her ironic, funny saying T-shirts.  This one was bright green.  Her hair fell over it, so gently.  She had beautiful long brown curly hair, two strips in the front bleached blond (damn smashing pumpkins).  Her breasts, even at that time, enthralled me, not too big, not too small, but situated firmly inside that shirt.  Her hips too, which I also can't get out of my mind to this moment, were tightly packed inside her cute corduroy pants (she called them potato-chip pants).  Red doc martin-like boots (the name escapes me).  Her long, slightly rounded face, so beautiful to me (even now), and lightly freckled, had the pleasure of being the home of two, HUGE, wondering and innocent blue eyes.  Long lashes.  She seemed upset or something.  I spoke.  I didn't stop for 8 years.  She was the love of my life.  More on that cunt later.    There is just too much going on now.  I can't control my mind.  I'm losing it, and strangely I don't worry about the outcome anymore.  Now thats living.  Ha!  I can't stop crying, and it sounds stupid and girly, but c'mon, get off my ass.  Maybe its helping, I don't know.  It used to take a lot to spill tears, now they flow without warning.  My dad thinks I'm nuts and just avoids me.  I'm crying right now.  Lachrymology, thats it.  Google it if you want, or whatever the hell it is you crazy kids call it these days.  I'm crazy, I can't take it anymore, and I want to die.  My body doesn't work anymore, and my mind is slowly rotting away.  No energy anymore, just pain.  And its not just girl problems, she doesn't give a fuck and I should stop too.  Thats logical.      I'm an animal now, and everything on this sad planet is mine.  I have to start taking.  Every single thing on earth will either be eaten, fucked, loved or killed by me.  Thats all I can do, and I'll stop pretending I should be doing something else.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Whew!  Anyway, how bout that Smarty Jones, huh?  I think that horse is great, he looks so happy and cute, unlike most of these other race horses that look pissed off all the time.  And his owner?  Damn, I hope that guy makes it long enough to even see the Stakes!  If his horse wins again, you're likely to see him die on live T.V.   Jesus was in this guys high school year book for crying out loud!  I mean, this guy is O-L-D, old!  Sorry, enough of that.    First undefeated horse to win both the derby and Preakness since Seattle Slew.  Remember Seattle Slew?  Of course you don't!  that was a hundred years ago.  No cinderella bullshit story here, just the first triple crown winner in a long long time.  I'll be at Belmont this year (ladies take note), cheering this horse on and probably losing.   He had no idea what the fuck was going on, he was just having fun.  I love animals, I converse (not in a cat person crazy way) with my dog Brandy for hours sometimes.   Fortunately that horse was luckier than not-so smarty Roy Jones Jr.  Did you see that?  He had his fuckin head knocked off.  He literally slid outside of the ring.  But he deserved it, he's an asshole but he did show a humility in loss thats rarely seen now in boxing.  Not to mention the HBO cameraman who was subsequently knocked afterwards during a live feed.   .   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, for those of you waiting in suspense, here is that crazy ass dream..........     I start in some shore community.  It is walled in by mountains lying in the ocean.  I'm in a pub.  An old man starts some kind of shouting disturbance, with no notable consequence.  Seemingly contagious, another man right next to me starts getting frantic, and is chased out.  I am standing at that moment with a group of young guys, around my age.  In the confusion the old man next to me, the young guys, and now me too are running from the ensuing crowd.  I follow them outside, jumping into the ocean and following them.  I am immediately pulled into a strong current, heading straight towards the border of mountains.  At the last second as I am approaching a rocky death, a tunnel type hole comes into view, and I'm sucked through it.  I notice the first old man has just passed through, slightly ahead of me, and now the chasing mob is getting closer.    On the other side, the gloomy weather and dark cold water are gone, now the sea is bright, blue, and shimmering.  Beautiful.  I see a two step platform short waterfall.  I jump very high, an ability I recognize as having often in my dreams.  Forward leap, then I'm at the mouth of a small cave.  An ancient clay pot sits on the left side of the entrance.   There are thin stalks of green plants inside.  One of the younger guys ahead of me takes one out and enters.  He turns back to me.  "Let me do the talking"    Inside it is furnished like a home, slightly familiar.  What can best be described as a "hot" girl greets us.  I ask her what the hell is going on.  One of the old men says he couldn't take it anymore and wasn't able to stay at that shore place we came from.  He's not too specific (could this be a "Logan's Run" reference).  Ol' Nic is already analyzing at this point, while still in the friggin dream!  I ask him where we are.  He gives me a name I can't remember.  Apparently this new place is some kind of island.  It appears to be foreign to me (ie; another country)    Time passes, and I end up using the bathroom here often.  It seems to be a big house inside this cave.  Comfortable, wooden, and rustic.  There are a lot of bathrooms here.  One of them has two doors, one from the hallway, the other leading out into the kitchen.  It has inside a bidet, pink porcelain toilet, and a shower.    Now the girl, wearing clam digger pants, high sandals with painted red toes, flirty, says we have to get ready for the "party".  By now the old men are gone, and I'm left in the house with one other young man, this girl, and what seems to be her mother.  The girl takes the other guy upstairs for what she says is "hair and wardrobe"    The girl's mother offers me some home made cookies.  I drop one on to the carpet and pick it up. I examine them, breaking one apart and ask "are there any nuts in these"  (note: in reality I have a bad food allergy to most nuts and sesame seeds so thats usually a standard question for me).  I notice now she is still standing there, looking over me and obviously wondering why I haven't eaten.  She tells me there are nuts in them, but I should try eating them anyway, they probably won't bother me.  I tell her sorry, I don't mean to be rude but I can't.  She apologizes for being "in my face".   I end up taking a bite anyway, it is the dream world after all, right?  Well it turns out I'm still allergic and I get up to get rid of the cookies.    I start going upstairs.  The banister leading up is very warped.  Touching the pole at the beginning, the entire white chipped painted railing begins to creak and sway side to side.  The party is starting now.  Everyone is very friendly.  They seem smart, warm and college-aged.  Not noticing this before, I'm wearing glasses.  Somehow they break and someone offers me theirs.  Some time has passed again and simultaneously myself and another girl sitting down mention to the guy who gave me the glasses thats its strange we happened to have the same prescription.    All of a sudden, I'm back home on Jamaica Avenue (real home).  I'm in what seems to be a 1 hour photo place or a travel agency across the street from my apartment.  There seems to be a get-together there also.  2 familiar hispanic girls from the other party are there, now dressed in french maid outfits (nothing sexy).  They are walking around passing drinks to the crowd on trays.  They seem to be whispering and giggling about me.  In the store's front area, 2 middle aged men are standing there, seemingly in good spirits.  They are hairy, nude, but with no penises.  They ask me how my trip was and I ask exactly where the fuck that place was that I was at.  They don't give me straight answer as to where exactly this island is.  They say its rumored.  J.F.K. and a couple of other notable people and celebrities were secretly born there.   He says there is a small population there, and they commute (via ferry?) back and forth for work and supplies.  Then a couple comes out of the hall and complains that they haven't been seated yet, and that people are ignoring them.  I walk into another room where Jill (who has recently become my ex), is sitting.  I ask her why she dumped me, and of course she doesn't answer (another parallel to reality), I ask her if she has slept with anyone, she matter of factly, and with pleasure nods her head yes.  "Of course" she says, "and quite a few".    Thats all I remember.  Nic, big sopping emotional pussy Nic was jarred from sleep at that moment, in tears, (which happen a lot now, at the worst times, in public, on the train, in front of my family).

        In the beach house, the refuge from this muddling existence, I'm left to my art. I've created it myself, imagined the vacation in my own mind, down to each and every grain of sand on the shore, every green bottle washing up with a note inside....... "I'm here"     A thick, sharp and concrete-hard wall has been laid firmly between my eyes and a view of the sea. The mortar betwixt each brick spread more precise and exacting than the most skilled mason on earth can possibly make,  Punctuating the bleak reality that it will never fall, never come crashing down.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Yes folks, the digest is back after a short run in the city of blog.  The need to bleed has always been there, most likely will never leave me.  This space will not be used for blind emotional crying, the screaming of a dying puppy, complaining like the boy I am, dumped and betrayed (though now that I think about it, I do get a bit of a rise out of it)    Sometimes the beginning isn't very clear.  The rules are clear.  Take the ball and run.  Run anywhere just stop standing and waiting to be tackled.  No chronological order necessarily.  This stream of conciousness occasionally flows in a different direction.  The toilet of my life flushes counter-clockwise when its in Australia.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Today I began the long tedious reminiscent and ultimately gravely sad task of gathering the momentos.   All that she wrote, all that she wore and various other artifacts.  The wedding magazines, the books, the letters professing a love I will most likely never see again.  Its so much more than all that.  I've realized my worth and ultimately my worthlessness through her.   There is so much to say, everyone will see it.  Unfortunately this empty shell is drier than the fucking desert right now so I leave you with this, not a personal account of my exhaustion with my own sick never ending pit of life, but of someone else who (and I can't say definitively whether its fortunate or unfortunate yet), didn't make it out and was someone who the people around her couldn't handle......  "Dying is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call"    -Sylvia Plath

        Things have been just drifting along lately in this crazy river of life.  On my shoddy canoe, the rate of things passing me by seems to have slowed for now (its really day to day when you're nuts).  I see people I get along with, and I'm not worried about them trying to kill me like I used to be.    The annual pig roast, a heralded local event thrown by a lot of my friends and acquaintances was held last Saturday.  It was great, food, drink, and plenty of awkward moments, social miscues and girls who pretend they don't know you when the last time they saw you all they wanted to do was (expletive).  I had a good time, and as all my friends know, I'm not the ultimate lady killer.  I'm reduced to looking for sympathy because of my non existent playa level.  You know, girls and friends telling you that you have the ability to lady kill, stop being so nervous, you are a good looking guy.  Anyway, I'm always frozen, so imagine the glimpse of joy I felt when I laid eyes on this girl I've always liked but haven't seen in at least a year and a half.  The reason why this is interesting is because she at least seems to be equally down on herself, somewhat shy and a little awkward too much like me.  Not to mention I find her very physically attractive too.    I never approach girls really, I have to know them too well and by then its usually too late.  She seemed very nice, she remembered who I was though I didn't want to seem creepy for remembering the last time I tried to talk to her, which was a long time ago.  She has the cutest little baby voice, and it's obvious she's self conscious about it and might be under the impression that men try to take advantage of her or something.  Anyway, I didn't really talk to her until the roast was ending.  Everyone was then going to migrate to the local bar, most people driving, so we decide to walk it.  It was a nice summer night's stroll, and I feel like I'm a decrepit old man because I can't remember the last time I was alone, even in public, with a female who's not my sister.  We come back to the bar, and everyone is kind of eyeing me, I can't tell if they're making fun of me or actually surprised or happy to see me talking to someone of the opposite sex.  I think we got along great, everyone is like "get her number man", and all of a sudden she's telling me she's too old for me.  Now for me, I don't have a fetish or anything, but most of the girls I've gone out with or got along with have I think only coincidentally, been older than me.  Nothing ridiculous, but I think she said the difference was like 6 years.  Its a shame, we were getting along and I strongly believe, like Andre 3000's new Outkast album proudly proclaims   "Age ain't nothin' but a number"  So now its like I'm Goo-Goo the socially inept suicidal self hating Grizzly Bear.  I rubbed my eyes crawled out of my cave to talk to this chick because I just don't talk to chicks often, just to get shot down.  Now sadly I'll have to curl up and hibernate again.   And because Irony never sleeps, it just naps till it can wake up and embarrass you, there also happened to be this 50-something year old local business woman in attendance.  I mention this because not two nights earlier at this same bar, she was hitting on me heavily like nobody's business.  I know I don't have to mention this but that never happens either.  She's is very rich, flashed piles of cash falling out of her pants, tried to expose herself to me several times, etc..  It was tempting, I'll admit, I mean I am broke as hell, and I guess I did want to see if it was even possible for me to be a Gigolo for a night.  So of course everyone is like, whats the matter with you, are you gay?  She's fucking rich.  Jealous, they were I guess.  But alas, since I do worry to much about what people think of me, it just seemed to risky.  I started to feel suddenly nauseas so I literally ran home (this happens a lot for no reason lately, the urge to puke and go home).  End of story, right?  Wrong.  This night of the pig roast that I'm in the bar with this girl, this old woman, perhaps miffed at my rejection, is now claiming I fucked her, that I've been "inside her", and hinting that she wants to start a scene.  For some reason everyone thinks I actually did this and starts giving me the "tsk tsk" look.  WTF? She's staring at this girl I'm trying to talk to, and that put a dent in my night as well.   She doesn't have the best rep, and does have ties to some exotic Albanian Mafioso sect.  I value my life and don't need some hitman coming after me for fucking his mom.  When people run in circles its a very very mad world.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------     Just finished the first entry into the medical dilemma that is my life.  I suggest you all check it out.  Maybe some news first.    It is still the beginning of Iraq's independence.  God bless them, I just hope the post office is open on Saturdays.  I think its f-en hilarious that Paul Bremer barely stayed enough for the doctrine to be told before he escaped on the closest helicopter to the airport.   urlLink The Daily Show  expressed just this notion in a very insightful way.  On the other more human hand, of which I happen to have two, I think they would be "Maupin" - the floor with the blood of our soldiers.  Not only is there no rescue or recovery mission for him, because he is obviously and sadly dead, but there is the EVIL view of the blind polio-like democracy that is spreading suggesting that this man never lived, like he went to Iraq for the lovely Club Med they have there.  Ignorance is one thing, and blatant lies are another.  Don't have a fake motherfucking ceremony for the transfer of sovereignty while this guy/ and many other Americans (soldiers or not) are being murdered on your time.   THE METS WIN!   I know you all must be sick of this one teamed type baseball news but tonight in Cincinnati something moderately great happened.  First of all, being left handed myself, Cliff Floyd hit two home runs today (Tuesday), further reinforcing the fact that we are better than the rest of ya.  After all, what shoulder do you throw salt over for good luck?  What hand do the Nuns beat till you is a righty, eh?  -------------------------------------------------------------------  How about that Dr. Phil Family in Crisis series?     I think it is the best realistic life-applicable television around.   This family especially tickles me.  It is an ongoing thing, the kids are fucked up, they hate the stepfather, blah blah blah, he's not abusive or anything, but here is the kicker.  The mother had a kid as a result of a bi-racial affair (I'm not racist but I think its funny how evil women can be).  On top of that, they gave it up for adoption, and now the mother, deeply in debt and in the throws of a very visible bad family relationship, wants to be a surrogate mother for this new couple who has adopted this baby and also lives across the country from where they live.  She spends her time and money she doesn't have to go visit them. Unbelievable!!! Now that's good TV!!    --------------------------------------------------------------------  Locally, I think the NYU so called "pot-princess" is a cutie pie and a half!!  I think she's getting a bad rap, that's all.  I mean what's the matter with a couple of lines once in a while and a joint or two?  At least her clientele was preoccupied, preventing them from going to the library, strolling up to the upper tier and splattering their heads all over the marble floor!  (re: the rash of jumping suicides at NYU not long ago)   One of the charges was dropped recently when her boyfriend fessed up to his involvement.  Ain't love grand?    ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Now I know there may be a lot of television references here, but I have no life so shutup.  Quickly,  -Rachael Ray on the Food Network is so marriage material!  She's an actual cool girl you can trust with a knife.  Call me old fashioned but that's hot!  - I don't know if you've seen this new DEET commercial, you know the bug spray.  Anyway, its so eerily gay.  It's this tom selleck looking shirtless guy with a mustache inside a tent swarmed by computer generated mosquitos flying around.  -Real World finale sucked ass, but what can you expect.  I was just waiting for Cameran to say something retarded and I ended up not waiting very long. In the little update in the corner of the screen, after the suitcase is packed and the gaudy yellow SUV, or the water taxi, or the helicopter shows up to take these people, hers read "Cameran has no idea what she's going to do next"  It was just funny, I guess you had to be there.  Everyone else's said things like college, or rehab, or I'm opening a surfboard factory, that type of shit.  I was watching a show on Spanish language television named  urlLink El Gordo Y La Flaca , it means the fat guy and the skinny one or (girl).  Anyway, mostly because I have no love in my life, I've been strangely attracted to (remember I don't speak spanish at all) the female co-host.  She's Cuban I think, has a bit of a nose, something I've always been turned on to anyway.  I don't know if this is true, and maybe its just me but her appearance, although sexy I believe strongly encourages foot fetishes in people all over the world.  Her stems and feet have that universal appeal I guess.  But its like every camera angle has to have her long ass legs and feet in it.  On top of that she strokes them a little much for a talk television show.  Its quite interesting and I suggest you all take a look.

           It was at this time I wanted to start a medical journal in this mish mash of clouded thoughts.  I don't think its possible to categorize this blog in that manner without paying for it, so it'll just be embedded with all the other nonsense.    As I mentioned in an earlier entry, I finally received the proper paperwork and such to see a doctor through the great and lovely Medicaid program.  Yes I was a bit ashamed at first that things had gotten so bad that I've been reduced to state funded support.  Being a step away from welfare and living the "simple life" isn't exactly a solid floor to stand on.  Its aesthetic poverty or something like that, I try not to let it show.    There was a LOT of waiting time, being in need of surgery isn't an incentive for any of them to hurry the fuck up processing my application.  I accidentally picked the wrong plan at first, I think the woman at the office just wanted to go home that day and rushed me.  So then I disenroll from this plan, and enroll in a new one.  This "new one" I picked because much to my surprise I found that the surgeon who operated on me the first time was listed as a provider.  Good, I thought.  Now the ball is rolling.    So much time has passed.  My back hurts, I have no pain relief.  Nobody believes me.  Everyone thinks I'm just lazy.  Its so disheartening and upsetting.  I'm tired of explaining to people that I have to wait.    The day arrives when I can see a doctor under this new plan.  I'm excited, and nervous.  The office is only a couple of blocks away.  Great!.  (-Note- when receiving the new membership card, it came in a plastic sheet from which you were to punch it out from.  One card has my name and all the proper information.  The other, a filler I assume, is identical except it has no info on it and says glaringly across the face: NOT A VALID CARD)    I walk over to the office, its a very sunny beautiful day, the kind you wish you had a girl to skip with or something.  The nervous sweat begins, but its ok, I'll be fine!  Walk into the office, introduce myself as a new patient, I'm asked for my card and......     Obviously I brought the wrong card.  That's the way life works.  Now I have to sweatily and nervously run back to my house to get the right card.  Blah blah blah, I come back, open up to the doctor and explain how "doc, I don't neeeeeed no checkup"  I just want a referral to the surgeon.      So now there is a yellow rolled up proclamation of my existence as a real living man with a fucked up spine in hand, I walk home now, with a glimmer of hope in my big ass beautiful brown eyes (kidding, its a defense mechanism, this shallow cockiness)  Now time to make the appoitment for the surgeon.    I call and guess what?  This doctor does not take this plan as of a couple of months ago.  I must have not had the daily updated provider guide when I saw him listed.  In fact, the horrible bitch who picked up the phone told me, this doctor doesn't take ANY form of insurance.  I quickly hang up because now I'm fucking crying.      Its like being punched in the stomach.  I'm breathless, and the disappoitment and frustration is incalculable.  Last time my parents arranged everything.  Now I'm doing it all myself, and I used to have major issues with talking to strangers on the phone.  I've tried everything and I'm getting upset now because this isn't a minor snafu.  What the fuck am I supposed to do?  This is a goddamn $60,000 fucking operation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I immediately looked for all the other orthopedic providers listed.  Of course they all specialize in elbows and shoulders and shit, none of these people are coming near my spine ever.  I do find one guy who specializes in spinal surgery, reconstructive and otherwise.  I call, and of course, he takes NO FUCKING INSURANCE EITHER.     I'm trying to stay calm.  Everyone knows I was riding on this, and now I've hit a wall that I see no way around.  I've considered very balls to the wall like theories, to just check in to the hospital and worry about the bill later.  But my money situation is beyond horrible, and my parents have their own shit to deal with, especially my father, and especially in terms of money.  I began researching as much as I could, maybe there was a charity that provided funds for this type of thing, or maybe there was a decent surgeon that would donate his time to this cause or something.  "NO"    I'm below zero now, there is now clear next step, and the hopelessness creeps, you know?   I have trouble talking to people comfortably, even my friends.  I feel like such a worthless piece of shit bum.  And forget about women my friend, that shit is impossible.  I have come to terms with the fact that I must have NOTHING to offer a woman.  No car, cause they all want a ride home or something, that type of shit.    I'm no pussy, trust me.  I just really want to get under that motherfucking knife so I can breathe and walk again, all I want.    One notable suggestion I received was to hold a benefit, an event, which I thought was wonderful and great, but one setback prevented me from shooting myself in the head the second I thought of it.  I don't have many friends, much less those with a budget for medical donations, I don't know many local business owners that would be willing to help, but I HAVE to at least look into it.  And that is the first entry to my medical journal.  Judging from the doom and gloom filled first day of action and the impossible seeming hurdle ahead, this could be the last medical entry as well.  Whether it be at 4 o'clock in the morning or not, these things have to come out when they do, that's all.

      Various Tidbits  Today I FINALLY recieved the proper membership card and forms required to see a regular doctor first, then my surgeon so I can get going with the rest of my life in a sense.   Ooh the ladies will like,  I will be tall (at least a little tall-er).  Everyone knows swarthy and unstoppable oozing sex appeal don't work as well as when there's some height also.  I also have a growing interest in becoming a food writer.  Something accessible, and a bit anti-Zagat.  I've already learned never to use the words "decadent", or "atop".  Don't take anything for free either, because when you take shit, you end up taking shit.   Lets GO METS!!  The last two Mets games have been so moving and emotional, its almost unbelievable.  Completing a 3 game sweep of the Detroit Tigers felt pretty good, with Jason Phillips and Mike Piazza's dads in attendance on what was a stupendous Father's Day game.  Although still 2-3 games behind 1st place in the division, and only at a .500 record, Its freakin great this year.  Jose Reyes is back, and his tongue hanging out after hitting a triple and sliding in said it all.  New Met Richard Hidalgo (no relation to the horse), had his first hit as a Met, which happened to be a 2 run homer.  Tonight, its on to Cincinatti, with Ken Griffey Jr. and the Reds.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Nic on T.V.  I have a growing fascination with watching Spanish language television.  I don't know what the hell is going on, (I should know how to speak it well by now)  but I'm gradually melding with it.  NYCTV, The series of 4 local new york channels on cable is also suprisingly very interesting.  Concerts, council hearings, that type of thing.  My neighbor apparently is part of the camera crew, judging from his name in the credits of every single program, and the van parked outside.  I haven't actually seen him in months though.  More interesting the second time around, Ren and Stimpy classics are being played on Spike TV.  The Price is Right is always a winner.  Now with my ever present interest in the news, here are local cutie pies I can't help but watch  Amanda Farinacci (NY1 news) Vanessa Alfano (CBS2 morning traffic girl) The "Money Honey", first journalist to report live from the floor of the NYSE, Maria Bartiromo  Thats all for now, and I think it is only a coinki-dink that they're all italian.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   And now, a little insight from Chino......   "my knife it's sharp and chrome come see inside my bones all of the fiends are on the block I'm the new king I taste the queen"    Photo courtesy of Deftones.com

        I think I called her in a drunken stupor late last nigh.  Geeezzz!!  What's up with that?  I had made it a point not to do that, since she is the wrong one, the bad one, and etcetera.  I don't remember really what I said to her, nothing nasty, and of course, no crying.  She did wish me a happy birthday though (6/16)  I didn't share the things about my life that are going on, and I realize thats what rips me up inside, not having someone to share with.  In a way, she's right in moving on acting like I don't or ever existed.  In another way though, I'm right in being completely shocked at how abrubtly I was tossed aside.  I miss her so much.    On the other hand though, I know she's whoring it up, I know I've been celibate, and I couldn't stand to hear any details like that concerning her.    We've broken up before, and trust me when I say she wastes no time.  I kind of told her I didn't want to know who she was fucking.  Don't get me wrong here, I do have the opportunity to get laid from time to time, and I'm under the stupid fucking impression that there's still beauty in this world and that type of thing matters.  So I'll let her continue her whoring streak, because when I do break the seal, even if it is cheap and not the result of another long commited relationship, it will always be chock full o' honor and dignity. Who knows, she probably was sleeping next to someone when I called.  The next morning, when awake and sober, the glaring reality of it all shone through.   Three truths, as if written by the hand of god.   * There's still love in my heart * I'm a better person than her. * I'm better looking than her.

      Clang!  My life is enclosed in a basement, I'm groggy, open my eyes to hear a clang. Its a thick heavy chain dragging across the concrete floor, making the dry sandy sound over the thick level of dust that can only mean one thing. Eventually I find that the other end rests on shackles around my wrists.  Hard to realize and admit, but maybe just maybe I'm depressed.  There seems to be an always-present black cloud that sucks all moisture from the air, and stifles me.  I'm apprehensive, nervous at times, and ultimately alone.  Sometimes its so surreal.  I play the old AM radio just to hear voices.  Wednesday was my birthday, the centennial of Bloomsday.  It of course began with me crying a little involuntarily as soon as I woke up.  A feeling of going blind, systematically destroying every sense in my body came over me.  I ended up enjoyed myself I guess, though thoughts of the former love found a way to creep back into my mind.  I was actually expecting a nasty phone call, but nothing, nada.  I wouldn't just say I'm only skin starved, although I am a bit lonely on a deep underlying level.  Ended up keeping it simple, fish and chips, good amount of ale, spent time with my mother in a peaceful way, and of course my favorite, silence as golden as it gets.  A quiet knowing developed in me, and I smiled at the possibilities afoot.  The duck has returned to his previous home, there were tears and everything, but it didn't happen before one evening, when looking over him, I thought he dropped dead.  He had a little pen that he waddled around.  I would look in on him from time to time, and I just turned around, and he was on the floor, legs in the air, his neck twisted flat on the floor.  I tried picking him up, sprinkling water on him, finally he snapped out of it.  Scared the shit out of me.  There has to be some good, right?  I feel safe laughing now.  I'm not self made pathetic anymore.  I still enjoy those Mets games, although I didn't want to go on my birthday, I had a feeling they would lose, as they did.  Yesterday was Mike Piazza day, that was fun, they gave him a big yellow car with his name on the back, something he will probably NEVER drive in his life.  Carlton Fisk and Pudge were there too, I think of Pudge as the Piazza who speaks Spanish.  I'm working out more, as much as my back can tolerate.  Sometimes the pain is so immense I can't walk.  I'm actually ashamed at my lack of proper insurance, though that's being worked on.  I could have lost the girl over it, but its her loss.  I meditate regularly, and am on a plethora of dietary supplements.  Magnesium and Selenium for eradication of Asthma (I'm not smoking anymore), your regular multivitamin, and now the required large amounts of Iron and Calcium in preparation of my back surgery.   I'm also taking a cool oil blend tablet, that is cold pressed and provides what can best be described as "good" or "fitness" fat(s).    The confidence is returning, complements aren't taken with looking at the floor anymore.  I'm not actively looking for "love" persay, but I'm certainly not afraid of women anymore.  My skin has cleared up, and I'd be lying if there wasn't a "glow" now.  Now that I'm at a normal weight, the child like skinniness has melted away, leaving a somewhat chiseled man underneath.  I used to be very self conscious over being underweight most of my adolescent life.  My cooking is better, I make more of a variety of things with greater care, although I prefer having a lady to do it for.  I'm a provider baby - as Pharell used to say.  I saw this educational show on the family structure, and how little kids perception of their parents relationship changes but is so real and un-murdered when they are very young.  I laughed at how beautiful it was when one of the little boys summed it all up with this:     "I can't wait till I get in love, because I'll be by myself if I don't get in love"  And last but not least folks, I'm returning to the mother land.  Nic, awkward, outcast, lover and guy who doesn't speak a word of Spanish, will return to the land of my family after a long self imposed exile due to my parents own crazy situation and divorce, the place where my sister lived a good portion of her own life,  Puerto Rico.  I am going to have shitloads of fun, and the pina coladas and vagina will flow like milk and honey.  The beaches are gorgeous, the last time I was there I was 14 and stayed on some mountain somewhere.  This time cars will be rented, tours will be taken, and although it will be after my birthday, I'm gonna sip Bacardi like it still was.  I'm going with a couple of friends of mine, one of them also went to Ireland with me, the other, someone who is also Puerto Rican but who also hasn't been there in a lot of years.  I can't wait for the rainforest, the waterfalls are absolutely beautiful.  I'm also going to where they invented the pina colada.  Check out Arecibo, maybe some scuba diving.

        Crazy, reading the news.  It said "this just in!, a major instigating presence in the Middle East dating back from years ago has met an untimely death"  Who could this be? I thought.  Later the newscaster further explained.  "This man was a major figure in the war between Iran and Iraq way back when"  "Through covert operations, he sold weapons under the table to the Iraqi army, helping them defend themsleves and ensuring oil baths for many american babies to come"  I'm tellin ya kids, Contra wasn't just a Nintendo game.    Then it hit me.  Oh yeah, Reagan must have died!    Its the first death of a president to serve during my lifetime, so naturally I don't give a shit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Just finished watching the Mets game tonight.  Cruel like ice cold wind blows chills through widow's locks, rose cheeks stained by plum drop kisses.  15 innings, something to see.  I probably am losing it, but I swear I saw a pink Barbie tote bag just laying there, on the Twins' dugout bench.  Quite a sight I must say, but then again I'm all about the visual lately.    MTV awards, and I'll have to make a departure here.  I know its funky, and fresh, and hip to hate the foundation of easy access like say McDonald's, because your friend's cousin's girlfriend has a cool grandmother who makes some exotic spicy sausage that "you wouldn't believe".  Anyway, the Beastie Boys, in my opinion had an awe inspiring spilling of the love vibe greatness in their performance.  I usually don't take to the whole mtv award music acts, but that made me believe it was going to get better (my life, your life, our babies lives, you know)  The blatant self promotion by Michael Moore was inflated and unnecessary, the movie should be good and tickle your ears, but that is the way people were intended to process information.  That's all we're good for after all.    The duck is great, as happy as a duck can get in this situation I guess.  I watch the Honeymooners every night @ 3 in the morning.  I think Monica Bellucci and Christina Aguilera are very hot.  The best time to meditate is right before the sun rises.  Highest potential for unbridled natural greeny good energy to burst forth from the ground and pierce you through the nostrils.  Drink a lot of water.  That ain't no joke.    It's the only time of the day where we, the lonely passerby on this long dusty road of life get to see it in whole, the glorious cookie dough before pressed through its daily Christmas tree shaped cutter.  Its all "aurora borealis" every f-in day before we start to fuck it up, baby.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What's the sound of one hand Jap-ing?    "....no disrespect for the Orientals, but what we call Jap plays. OK. Surprise things."      Ba-Zing!    Honey, did you check the Tuna?  I think its gone bad inside the refridgerator Perry!  (as a side note, I am dying for a job as headline writer in either the Daily Show, or the back sports page of the Daily News)   Hows about that Bill Parcells?  Quiiitee the character.  General / Leader of both of our football teams at one time or another, he led us through the lily fields, and through the Coca plants.  He's nuts, he dyes his hair blond from time to time (I've seen it up close).    "No offense to the Orientals"      Everyone knows the term "oriental" in this PC world of today, can only be used when referring to products and goods coming from the "orient", rugs, etc..  Duh!    If I hear another "Ray Charles, huh?"  "I bet he didn't see that coming",   I'll Kill, I promise, .....I'll kill

        Well I haven't been able to appease my thousands-strong fanbase with a post lately, so here it goes.    I've simmered down a bit, the fog has cleared enough for me to see that there's more out there.  My frustration and sadness over being dumped was finalized when I realized there was no heart or soul on her side.      In the past month or so, there has been plenty of beer, plenty of Mets games (somehow happened to get a lucky streak of ticket hook ups), some serenity, and my ability to absorb pure energy through the air and ground is slowly returning.  I'm not as afraid to meet new people (ie; women) as I used to be.  Waiting right now for the magical princess to return is only that, a fantasy, not to mention more and more ridiculous and stupid sounding as each day passed.  Had only about two connections really on a personality level at least.  Ironically, the first one turned out to have the same name as my ex, the second, the same name as me (feminized).  That did throw me off a little, but I'm trying not to get paralyzed again, as I so often do.    Other than that, I've done some more volunteering, learned things about myself like I'm obviously on a different page than my counterparts, and that meeting someone is going to be very difficult.  I haven't had sex in almost 3 months now, and since I can't lower myself to a pity slut fuck when given the opportunity, my pipes have grown rusty and drying up quite quickly now is the lake of "game".  I've never been a "hey my place or yours" kind of guy anyway, so I have a few things working against me now.      I realize I actually have friends now, I realize I've been very paranoid in general for a long time.  My skin has cleared up.  I breathe deeply.  I communicate with animals (more on that later).    My birthday is also coming up.  Bloomsday, June 16.  Also the birthday of legendary hip hop figure Tupac Shakur.  When all the plans fall through and the birthday depression sets in, at least I'll have the pleasure of enjoying his entire catalog on the local rap station all day.  Looking for camaraderie with other Geminis, I looked for famous people born on that day.  I though Joan of Ark was born on that day, I've always admired her, but upon further reading it turned out to be Joan Van Ark, of soap opera fame.  It's rumored to be the date Mary Shelley had the dream that inspired her to write Frankenstein.  Its the birthday of Stan Laurel, the skinny one from Laurel and Hardy, and of Laurie Metcalf, lesbian actress of Roseanne fame.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "Pekin - Aboo!"    Now for the wonderful story about how I now have a duck.  He (she)'s my sister's duck actually.  She got him when he was a very small chick, completely yellow and she kept him at her boyfriends house.  He's grown to about a foot tall now, around 2 months old.      Anyway, she calls me the other day, crying about how she just broke up with her boyfriend, and how she needs to take the duck somewhere.  Me the painfully nice guy that I am let her bring it over.  At first I was afraid to pick him up, but then this incredible maternal urge has come over me.  There's more work than I expected.  He peeps at you, you can quack at him, he'll walk over and watch T.V. by you, sitting in the classic duck floating on water pose. Quite frequently he'll stretch out standing up straight, shaking his down and feathers, shaking his tail, and sticking out his tiny wings.   He's cute as hell and when you smoke pot and stare at him for a long time, its a completely wacky sight.  This thing waddles around, swims in the tub, and makes little peeping sounds (I don't think he can quack yet).  He goes nuts if you leave him alone, and now with the combination of an overly softy dog and now a duck, waking up in the morning is lots of fun (sarcasm).  The dog wakes me up to get fed, and the duck can start wailing at any time starting at 5 or 6 in the morning.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Other than that crap, I've seen "Perfect Blue", an anime masterpiece, about a pop star's struggle to make a transition to acting.  Unlike the giant robot sci fi genre of Japanimation, this exceeds in writing and pulling you in to the story.  Its also one of the few films of this kind that I think would be a success as a live adaptation.  Its definitely a role that can make Britney or Christina, and establish them as true multi-faceted artists.  Its nuts, you have to see it.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Call me nuts, but I think Bob Woodward looks like Ron Popeil.

       Yesterday morning, (now two days ago actually)&nbsp; after the hazy fog of painkillers and beer had lifted, it hit me, like a ton of stupid bricks (they make stupid houses).&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things were realized at that moment.&nbsp; One, that the pundits are really right, that I'm pathetic and its not just my imagination or me beating myself up.&nbsp; The second though was a little unclear at first.&nbsp; First I thought I called "her" (def. see "the one").&nbsp; After consulting the local FBI office, and scouring various phone records, that turned out not to be the case.&nbsp; As it turns out, through the glory of technology in today's fast paced society I instead sent her some long lame ass email.&nbsp; You know the type "I love you", "I'm whiny and want you to further insult me, wah wah"     I don't know if I'm a glutton for heartbreak and last second pain, or if I'm just the biggest retarded asshole in the world and I'll never learn, either way I just needed to get something out.    Of course, I know she's horrible now and there is nothing I, or anyone else can do about it.&nbsp; Her nasty response was of course recieved later on and only reinforced that sad fact.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Puerto Rico countdown as of today, July 29, 2004, 12:00 Pm Noon is exactly 12 hours.    Soon, I will shave my head, a symbolic ritual for me as I will be entering a simple, earthy stage.&nbsp; Doom and possible medical tragedy awaits my return in 10 days, but for now, it will only be nature, water, peaceful breezes, natural beauty, rainforests, giant satellite dishes, lizards and beer. In one last gay move of listing song lyrics like a teenage girl, here was the relevant song of the week, by a group I'm increasingly very interested in, a little diddy by a group called The Postal Service.    Smeared black ink... your palms are sweatyAnd i'm barely listening to last demandsI'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath where i amI'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with bigh block letters adherent to my chestThat tells your new friends i am a visitory here...I am not permanentAnd the only thing keeping me dry is where i amYou seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complexA stranger with yor door key explaining that i am just visitingAnd i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leavingD.C. sleeps alone tonightYou seem so so out of context in this gaudy apartment complexA stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visitingAnd i am finally seing why i was the one worth leavingThe district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lightsAnd send the autos swerving into the loneliest eveningAnd i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving    He's right, of course, the District will sleep alone tonight if you will.    As a going away present, here is my brandy.

       In other news, the day draws near till I return to the land of my people to regain my throne as latin prince of coolness.&nbsp; It seems like only yesterday I bought these tickets (birthday gift), it was at least a month and 1/2 ago.    &nbsp;  I haven't been there in what must be like 10 years now, when on vacation, my parents suprisingly announced their divorce and more suprisingly, that only my father and I had return tickets home while my sister and mother were staying there to live.    &nbsp;  Being the summer before my entrance into high school and also marking the "beginning of the end" for me mentally and progressively, I must have been 13 or 14 at the time.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Not having been there since then, and now being of age to drink and gamble and have fun and all that, I've been a little apprehensive to say the least about the impact this trip will have on my immediate development on what I want to call "the plan".&nbsp; This "plan" will officially begin when I walk down the two blocks from my apartment to the local bar, luggage in tow, to be one of 3 guests of honor at the official going away party to be held there.&nbsp; God forbid that I'm paralyzed or worse upon my return and subsequent start of the medical "work up" leading to my surgery.&nbsp; This involves mucho medication, tests, a spinal tap, many x-rays and weekly injections of  urlLink Procrit &nbsp;in my ass, unfortunately the only part of my body with a healthy amount of fat in it.    &nbsp;  Procrit if it sounds familiar to you at all, is the basis of many a pharmaceutical television commercial these days.&nbsp; It most often involves some really old man or woman, working as a crossing guard or something like that, complaining that they can't pick up their grandkids or play softball and play lacrosse anymore, that type of crap.&nbsp; It is used most often in patients undergoing chemotherapy, also in patients being treated for HIV and AIDS, anyone who may experience some form of anemia at one point or another.    &nbsp;  The whole thing is very very depressing.&nbsp; It sucks obviously to feel weak, and abandoned, like nothing is working out and the ticking of the "clock" pounds into your skull and you have no real love in your life, like it's going to end at any moment.&nbsp; Ironically, I'll probably get some kind of cancer just from the huge amount of radiation I'm exposed to going through all the preliminary tests.&nbsp; It isn't like I broke my wrist or something and the x-ray is localized.&nbsp; Since the problem is my goddamn spine, all x-rays involve full chest/torso body scans, which unfold in three pages, like some sick centerfold.&nbsp; The actual time of the whole "ok, hold your breath now" shit is much longer than a regular x-ray.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I'll cry more about this later.    &nbsp;  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   ANYWAY,&nbsp;        &nbsp;  on this subject of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; I'm going with two friends of mine, one of which&nbsp; I went with to  urlLink Ireland , now 4 years ago, and also the last time I had a vacation of substance.&nbsp; It was there I had an epiphany, met a beautiful woman, and decided not to let another great opportunity pass me by, resulting in me&nbsp;extending my originally planned vacation of 5 days to something like 4 months.&nbsp; There I just got along better in general.&nbsp; I was interested in getting married even, staying there and starting a new life.&nbsp; The people were wonderful, interesting and I was immersed in the culture like you wouldn't believe.&nbsp; I spent Christmas at this girl's home, the family aspect was so much more accepting and warm.&nbsp; It was fun, and I did learn more during that time than I could ever have learned in school.&nbsp; I also had to cover for this friend for his reckless philandering and straying from his long-term girlfriend at the time, causing much guilt.    &nbsp;  The point is that I, of Spanish and Puerto Rican descent, do not speak a word of spanish, making me an immediate outcast and so called "sell out" among the local Newyorican community, much of my family, and most hispanic girls.&nbsp; Grabbing my balls and exuding confidence and pride during these 10 days will only help me.&nbsp; Its time I worked the mojo at a level not yet seen on this earth.    &nbsp;  Everyone close to me, already knowing I'm in a wallowing pit of sorrow and glum sadness, are making honest and kind attempts to cheer me up.&nbsp; Being shy and not quite the "life of the party" that I should be, I think I'm coming off as stuck up or unappreciative.&nbsp; It's a vicious cycle.&nbsp; My pilot light of a spark seems to have been long since extinguished.&nbsp; They say "hey Nic, this is what you need, you'll go out, have fun, get laid and everything will be ok once you get back, you'll have a clear head".    &nbsp;  Sounds fun, but of course, I'm still a sad depressed fuck.&nbsp; Being a little too emotional and pathetic at the moment, I have fought the urge to call Jill, the love of my life, to tell her she has one more chance, lets be beautiful again and I have no interest in touching random girls on this gorgeous island.&nbsp; I don't want these friends to be witness to my late night crying fits or jinx or ruin any amount of fun I should be capable of having on this trip.

       I really thought the ride was over before it began, but after what is now months of turmoil and disappointment.... a breakthrough.     &nbsp;   I've had many unsuccessful attempts of being cared for and having what is now going to be the  urlLink second, "revisionary" surgery  for my problem (very bad scoliosis), to have this broken piece of  urlLink Titanium  floating around in my organs (or what I like to call the "good stuff"), removed, and ultimately replaced.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Unfortunately, this is an issue that is now very long standing and in my most professional opinion has ultimately  ruined     my life.&nbsp;     My personal relationships have been affected, mostly by people thinking I'm just lazy due to my inability to hold long term work because of it.&nbsp; Of course, there should have been the opportunity to attend college or other higher secondary education in spite of this, allowing me to acquire decent work/career status through that route.&nbsp; Sadly, the relationship most affected by this situation was the one between my former girlfriend and I.&nbsp; This was devastating and the most heart wrenching thing I've ever had to deal with.&nbsp; On and off for 8 years, I was ready to marry this woman, and make her my princess.&nbsp; Bringing that up won't bring her back though, and I have to have faith that my intentions were ultimately purer than hers, even though I have absolutely no social skills around women anymore.&nbsp; Finally, I hoped she would be there for this very emotionally and physically painful and life-risking event I'm about to go through.&nbsp; If I'm paralyzed, at least I'll be happy (on the inside)    &nbsp;       &nbsp;    Anyway, after many unsuccesful attempts at having this taken care of as quickly as possible, finally    some progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, as one who isn't very gung-ho about going under the knife or even entering a medical institution for  ANY   reason, my hopes, though now I realize child-like and uninformed, were to have this second operation done by maybe, I don't know,   THE FRIGGIN GUY WHO DID IT THE FIRST TIME  !  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds crazy, I know, but a man with no insurance or stable income in this sad country just isn't a man.      &nbsp;   My intentions were in the least, to hopefully have this operation done in the same hospital as the first time.&nbsp; My previous surgeon  urlLink Dr. David Roye , director of Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery at the well known  urlLink New York Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital , was listed as a provider on the "what I'm reduced to" now slightly privatized Medicaid program (for us poories).&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course with my luck, once I contacted his office I just missed the deadline where he doesn't accept that insurance by something like 3 days.&nbsp; Ok, I thought, its pretty obvious that God has something against me.&nbsp; I knew that already and moved on.&nbsp; His appoitment taking office was extremely dismissive and kinda rude actually.&nbsp; Discouraged, I drank like a fish and cried.&nbsp; Somehow, I call now and suddenly, they suggest a&nbsp;partner of his who takes this insurance and will see me.&nbsp; The appoitment is August 13 (I know what you're thinking, and yes, it is a Friday).&nbsp; Just wish me luck, and wish for the use of my legs in the future too.

      &nbsp;   Bill Clinton is a freakin' rockstar baby!!      &nbsp;   &nbsp; Just finished watching the former president's speech from the DNC in Boston and, as is the popular consensus, my opinion is that he's an amazing public speaker, and generally a very together man who "draws you in" to whatever he's talking about.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; His tribute to the democratic party's candidate  urlLink John Kerry &nbsp;was direct, unclouded and motivational.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; Controversy over Hillary Clinton's role not as a keynote speaker and ultimate political woman but what seemed to be only a loving wife introducing her extremely famous husband, began not one second after she began speaking.&nbsp; A last-minute shift in scheduling and changes to her speech aroused sentiments of disappointment in almost all other office holding women in attendance, including fatty extraordinaire,  urlLink Betsy Gotbaum      &nbsp;   --------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;      "Shove It!        &nbsp;    &nbsp;Speaking of famous first wives, (or future ones),  urlLink Theresa Heinz Kerry , who I'm increasingly growing fond of and who somehow strangely turns me on now, spoke not like a plastic white bread fake public speaker, but like an actual real person (hark- the Gods are now throwing the world into chaos)      &nbsp; Last night while attending&nbsp;a Massachusetts Statehouse reception, she was accosted while on camera by reporter Colin McNickle, working for the notoriously loosely fact laced conservative crap rag, the  urlLink Pittsburgh Tribune-Review .&nbsp; He asked Mrs. Kerry to clarify a statement she made recently using the term "Anti-American", apparently referencing the state of Republican politics at the moment.      &nbsp; After several attempts at annoying her, she responded a few times saying "I didn't say that".&nbsp; Leaving to attend to her fellow Pennsylvanian constiuents and after a short talk with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, she immediately returned, which most people don't have the balls to do these days, approached the weasel in question and said        &nbsp;   "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."      God bless that woman.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        Oh hail the mighty "You gotta Believe" Mets!!    Tonight, in support of an impressive performance by the one, the only, Steve Trachsel, kicked major ass, and did not take the time to take any names.    After about a 90 minute rain delay, the notoriously retarded mascot in baseball, the Phillie Phanatic, dusted off home plate signaling the conditions were finally in place to  "Play Ball"     In yet another case of the World Series Champion not being so kick ass when the Mets are involved, the Florida Marlins also lost tonight, to Pittsburgh, who have won the last 12 of 13 games.  The standings for the National League East, as of 1:38 AM Thursday, are as follows:  -------------------------------------------------------------------  East                 W    L    PCT.    GB    Home    Road  RS  RA  STRK  LS10(last 10) _________________________________________________________   Philadelphia        44   39   .530   /    24-20    20-19  436  407 Lost 2  6 - 4   NY METS!!  (Yeah)   43   40   .518  UNO!  24-16    19-24  373  347 Won 2   6 - 4     Atlanta (Laaa--rry) 43    41    .512  1.5   22-19  21-22  399  367 Won 4   8 - 2  Florida (WC)        43    42    .506   2    22-21  21-21  362  373 Lost 1  4 - 6  Montreal            28    58    .337  16    15-26  13-29  282  392 Lost 3  4 - 6   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   And there it is folks, in plain English I'm sure all you can understand, especially the high rate of shit spewing Yankee fans out there.  In my personal opinion, this is no accident my friend, not the result of multiple errors by the opposing team, nor the result of (ie: yankee fan explanation), a magical evil wizard summoned by a combination of Satan and Fred Wilpon.  No my comrades, this is legitimate this time, the "real deal".  No lottery, wild card or any other form of crap.    Heed my words, by the end of the All Star Break, not only will 2 Mets (Piazza and now Glavine), not just one, will have amazing performances, with no bullshit involved.  After this "break", the Mets will not only be in 1st place, they will COMMAND the respect of the rest of the nare do wells in the division.  I'm not a crazy baseball guy, I'm sure some of you would think so at this point.  After many suggestions from my peers to be a sports writer, I've come to one realization.  That is that I'm not a "numbers guy", nor do I care about more than 4 of the 30 MLB teams out there.  You know why?  Well I'll tell you why.  That's because I don't have the F-en energy to pay attention to all the crap going on in this "fruited plain".  That is because not only am I from NY, but I happen to be from the largest borough in this city, born and raised.  And although I love Manhattan baby, I'm from Queens, so shoot me (please don't).      Yes, it may all be former farmland, but I appreciate the tree I have within a 2 mile radius of my house.  I like being close to the city by public transportation, but not quite close enough to have a building fall on my beautiful head.    It's not only that, eggling.  It has to do with the fact that although riddled with scandal, union strikes and general philandery involved with the players, it is by far one of the only "true" sports out there.  The rules are logic, the calls still conditional (as humans are).  New York has had, at one point, 1 American League team (the Spankees), and 2 National League teams (the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants).  Now call it Republican verses Democrat, or the Evil Empire verses some guy with a saber and his sister, or the puppy kickers verses the penguin habitat maintainers, whatever way you choose to describe it, the National League is where you see your cousin Louie Faccimata actually on the field in a professional matter, not affected by contracts or pressure.     Hard Nosed    That's what they call it folks, hate to break it to ya.  It is the term used when your balls are against the wall, defeat is only one strike away, and you still let your heart shine through.  What's the fun of watching a team that always wins?  A team who has a hack at the helms, not considered a hack just because he has loads of money?    You see, Daniel Son, the Yankees work like the mafia, hard as it may be to believe.  When someone beats the Yanks, since it is still illegal to kill your enemies in baseball (thank God), they somehow end up on the Yankees the next year (or day depending on if its before the trade deadline).  I won't get into the Monopoly discussion, but I'm glad the Yankees were swept on Streinbrenner's birthday, I'm glad Cashman looked like he was about to cry in fear of his job, and I like how people are finally taking the Mets seriously.  Sunday marked not only our independence as a country, but the first time the  urlLink New York Mets  have swept the Yankees, EVER.   "Sometimes things go well,"    "And first place is a nice short-term goal for us. We have an opportunity and we have to take advantage of it tomorrow. To come from where we've been, this shows the character of this team. We kept our focus when we weren't doing well, and now we're starting to play well." Cameron said.    1st Place TOMORROW!!!!

      Hello my babies,    It's been an interesting holiday weekend, and yes, I know its Wednesday already.  For a while there, the haze of booze, drugs, and NO proper girls took its toll.  As we all know, my recent streak or track record, or luck or whatever it is has been sadly off the mark.  The stock is either very much older than me, only a little older than me and apprehensive of it, illegally very much younger than me, hideous, married, parents of small children, or multiple combinations of these.    Anyway, I went to a really cool party (I'm not sure if people still use the word "cool" anymore), there a couple of friends of mine married not too long ago.  I haven't seen most of those people in a while so immediately, I'm paranoid and worrying about how I'm going to get home because its a whiles away from my place and its a bitch to get to without a car.    In terms of my vaginal magnometer seeking device, I'm not the type to walk into a room and quickly survey the room for "play".  Now I realize I should start doing that.  I start off drinking way too much (not sloppy), and not eating enough.  For some reason I become enamored with one girl there who I swear to god looks exactly like  urlLink Soleil Moon Frye , which automatically drives me nuts.  Of course I'm unable to properly put the moves on her or anyone else because of what could be described now as depression or crippling insecurity or whatever.  As a defense mechanism or extreme case of just being a pussy, I decide instead to voice my shyness to my friend, host of the party, when he asks why I'm not going for it.  I explain my poor social skills now, being used to being with my ex for so long.  He responds with some "I know what you mean" and its all bullshit and get over it, which helps but this is what pisses me off that I'm such a pathetic asshole that I'm reduced to third party high school prom interaction.      A couple of more drinks, and now she (Punky Brewster) and another girl (her best friend and hostess of party) are dancing in front of the couch I'm sitting on.  I'm trying my best not to ogle.  I think that's polite, being raised right and all, I mean my friends married to her so that's creepy right?  Wrong - girls just think that's gay.  Somehow I end up dancing, making eye contact and all, that type of crap, everything is cool and I'm finally talking to her.      32 bong hits still later, a couple of shots with her (this whiskey thing where you suck on a sugared lemon afterwards), and I'm so preoccupied with getting a ride home and not being stuck that I don't get a number or anything.  On one hand, ok, now I know her so the next time I see her it's completely on, it does helps that her best friend is my friend's wife.  On the other hand its still sad to take so much time regrouping and overthinking.  I'm ultra responsible right now, and I know I'm in a situation where this back problem spills over and affects all aspects of my life, making me very quiet in public.  I just think I don't have much to offer a woman right now so they're just not going to be interested, and in turn I end up not even bothering.  I really feel like I'm losing it but I also know I MUST increase this rate of only making a move every 3 years or something.    What I also learned that night was that the first step is arrangements.  I was told bluntly at one point something along the lines of "well why aren't you going out anywhere?"  Of course I'm like  "Well I don't have a huge spending budget, transportation, friends, blah blah blah"  but then we both agree that hanging out in the neighborhood I live in isn't going to help.  How can I be so stupid?  I ignored the glaringly obvious fact that first off, there's no eligible ass around here.  Secondly, the circle is so small that it is not practical to keep going local with hopes of meeting someone of substance.  This Grizzly don't want everyone else's honey up in my bear claws.  I'm on a motherfucking tirade right now, I finally have someone to go to the  urlLink Siren Music Festival  in Coney Island with, something I'm not too personally connected to I just really want to go to see as much music as possible this summer.  I'm just not as uptight and nervously hunched shoulders like anymore, which is good.  So that was Sunday.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Next day, Monday after holiday which I didn't know but is also considered the holiday day, I went to yet another barbecue.  Huge departure from the previous day, but enjoyable nonetheless.  This is a bbq at my dad's girlfriend's house.  Keep in mind my other neurosis over not being able to speak the language of my people, Spanish.   Needless to say, this was going to be tricky too.  It was a good time, didn't speak much as usual, though I didn't feel as bad about it as the previous day.  Now for the other side of my dilemma del nookie.  There must have been 5 young girls there doing the whole giggling from afar thing.  I get the whole, "oh, they like you" thing, and I'll be honest, a couple of them had asses you could smash a  urlLink '67 Chevy  into.    Expectedly, they turn out to be 16-17 years old, which makes you feel very creepy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Kanye West:  Live at the Hard Rock  is on right now, on that channel where they play the music videos and stuff.  He didn't immediately tickle me when he first arrived "on the scene", but there's something about that  urlLink Jesus Walks  song and the video that is very good, and I'm not religious or anything.     My new mantra:  " Jesus Walks  - God show me the way because the devil tryna break me down"   " Jesus Walks  - And I don't think there's nothing I could do now to right my wrongs"

      Sadly, the man dubbed the "greatest actor of his generation" passed on today, at the age of 80.  Marlon Brando, born April 3, 1924.  He won his first oscar for "On the Waterfront", then passed on accepting the one he won for "The Godfather" in protest of the U.S. treatment of Native Americans.  In 1990 his son killed the boyfriend of his half-sister, and was convicted.  She herself committed suicide 5 years later.  The cause of his death is being witheld by his family, as he was always a private man in his personal life.  I can tell you with %100 certainty though, that it didn't happen in a tomato field with an orange rind in his mouth.

        So the house really must be full, the crack house that is!  Wow, I think she needs to just "cut it out" (cue uncle joey hand gestures).  Somewhere  urlLink Kimmy's  shaking her head in dismay.  It's not that big of a deal anyway, whether she's anorexic or a cokewhore.  Either way, it makes her hotter in a sick way.  Dems the pits kid.  --------------------------------------------------------------------    "Ok I'm sick of this crap, YOU'RE FIRED!!"   I gotta admit, the guy doesn't back down easily.  Referring to himself in the third president, Senor Hussein walked in like only the last 4 minutes of Law & Order can show.  Although very very crazy, he waved his hands about, proclaimed his innocence, and actually hit one subject squarely on the head.  He basically said hey, why you lookin' at me punks, the real criminal is G.W. baby!  You're going to nail ME for invasion years ago?  --------------------------------------------------------------------  On the homefront, things are drifting by slow like honey.  The "shooting myself in the face" feeling comes and goes from time to time.  The fourth of July is coming up, and I'm scrambling for a ride somewhere, far far away.  Its also different being single now, its not like new year's eve or anything, but like a great man once said, it's always nice to have someone to make out with when stuff is blowing up.      I'm still stuck without a proper avenue to take care of this back problem, the focus has shifted unfortunately (because I think its a diversion of time), towards legal recourse one way or the other.  I almost won the lottery, but then again almost is a shitty word.  I'm almost happy right now for instance.  It gets a little tough to divvy up your time between maintaining the  urlLink fauxhawk  and masturbating.    Once again, the  urlLink Metropolitans  won in Cincinnati, which is a good thing.  Now there's at least a little bit of time before the Yankees come to Shea to play them.  It's a rough time right now for baseball fans, even though everyone is watching the Yankees/Red Sox matchup. (thats SOOO 80 years ago, jeez!)
