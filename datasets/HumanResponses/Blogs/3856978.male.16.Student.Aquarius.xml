						   right enough with the cosmosis. jenna is back tomorrow night so i have to buy her the best flowers here for my baby.  it was sunny for most of the day and then it rained, i am happy because my leek patch is growing and i have a likening for them so i went down to moss bros and bought a suit it cost me £999.99 that is supposed to be a bargin. goddamit things are too expensive. so i tried it on and people like it. so long as jenna does. i am going to pick her up tomorrow at gatwick so i have to get a lift with james. i want to point out to the stupid jordan and daniel that their story is not believeable and that i would like to email them at some point. at some point somebody is going to be pissed off because they are not really again their personas are awfully ridiculous. who is this parker is a poophead? can anyone have a more oaf like name? here coy_stars@hotmail.com get me

						   it's killing me slowly..goddamit i am missing Jenna where are you babe? i really should have gone to ibiza with her, it is not for me guys. no i am not a loner but i have to work with the guys we're sounding pretty good lately god i sound like such a bastard. so i ran past my old gym and i went down there again for a run down the tracks and i have decided to get myself into shape again. anyway i was searching on google and these so called blogs came up. by some jordan and daniel, i really ought to know who would believe such things a 12 year old prøstitute? that is sick and this daniel i am sure he is not real along with this jordan or the possibility of them being real but their names being misused or them being stupid. so i told them to stop the charade. i am glad my girlfriend is not a person like that if their personas are real. but who am i to talk i lost my virginity at 12 with my first girlfriend sure it was not great but i did it. i am going to go get a drink i need one this world is going down so bad -signed off from the doubting thomas
