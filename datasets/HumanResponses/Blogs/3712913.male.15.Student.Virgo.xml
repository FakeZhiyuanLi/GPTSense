      As some may know, school started today. Here's the "lo' down" on my current classes (all of which are eighteen weeks, ninety minutes per class).   English II Honors -  This is my "mandatory" shitty class. I already know it isn't going to be much different than the year before, which is to say this teacher is going to seem nice (and/or cool), but is, in reality, a bitch.   Biology I -  This class seems alright. I don't know many of the people in it, and I don't expect to become friends with any, but they seem really nice (and some funny), and the teacher is able to deal with anyone in the class very well.   Introduction to Business -  This one class is one I can somewhat look forward to. A few people I know, and some friends are in it. Also I honestly am glad I have it since, as I am always hearing, it is hard to survive in the business world. This class should help me prepare... or something, also the teacher is really calm, almost zen like I suppose.   French I -  Hmm, French. I don't know what to say, it seems pretty nice... though I'm sure it'll be pretty hard if I loose track or am absent for a single day. But it's good I chose this over Spanish, because (as I found out today) French is the first language of 50 countries or so (Spanish of course being used in less countries around the world).  "Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."  -- Plato   The bus ride home was sadly, horrible. Our bus is much more crowded this year (by, honestly, twenty or thirty more people) and it is in some places three people per seat. Very uncomfortable, and Christ! Can these people complain (rhetorical question)! I finally told some of these asses to just complain to their parents, who would thus complain to the school board, and things would be switched around and made more comfortable. It happened before (when I was in seventh grade... or maybe it was eighth) and it can happen again.    To chase a feather in the wind...

       Well, I've deleted my old blog and started this new one. If anyone would like to post on my blog please sign it so I will know who it was, or at least sign it if I know you. Also, I don't usually update my website because my host doesn't let me post more that about 1.5 bytes (or maybe it's megabytes) per image. I might switch to GeoCities though, since they are supposed to have a great deal for  free  hosting. That's all for now, I'll try to post every three to five days... though I'm not sure if I'll always be able to do that.
