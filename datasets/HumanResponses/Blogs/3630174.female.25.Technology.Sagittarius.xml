      I really can't wait to go back to my hometown.. take some time off from this shithole. It's a generally nice place to work, but SOMETIMES.. I wish I can squeeze a few necks... All that matters to the higher ups are statistics, that's all. Catch these idiots and put them in our place, doing our job, and I don't think they can survive for even 2 weeks. They don't understand us, coz they're sitting so high up they can only see black specks moving on the ground.  Somebody should take a big club and knock their ass down  Don't be too generous, coz other people ain't gonna be generous to u. Especially not at the work place. That's one of the things i learned for my 1st job here. Anyway, gotta get back to my job, before my beloved boss breathe down my neck.  By da way, I DID NOT get a pay raise, which my boss hinted at weeks ago. It was just a gimmick to make me stay on, I think. Shucks!

      Ever got that funny feeling that something is in the air that everyone else seem to know about except you??? That's how today feels like...  Am I just paranoid? Maybe it's just my imagination that people at the office are looking at me from the corner of their eyes, whispering things..looking away when I look back..hmmmm... Nevermind.. have to concentrate on my job..

      As I walked into the office today, i looked at all the banners hanging at the foyer.. "International", "Courageous", "Responsive", "Trustworthy" and "Creative". The so called 5 core values of the company. Well, I suddenly thought of my mom, who definitely have all these values and much more.. If she only had the chance to work in the corporate world, boy, she would have shone like the north star in a black night. I'm not half what she is. I don't think I'll ever be, either. She's got guts, and lots of heart. I sure miss her today.. but yay!! I'm going back this weekend to see her!!!! :)

      Damn, I really hate call coaching sessions at my workplace :(  Sure, I know it's important for people working in call center environments to have a script or conversation guideline, but I think it's stupid to be so rigid. Imagine rules like 1) HAVE&nbsp;to at least repeat the caller's name twice 2)&nbsp;CAN'T say 'bye' to the caller, even though they say 'bye' to you (the most stupid rule I think) 3) HAVE to close the call with 'Thank you for calling XXXXX (company name)" 4) CAN'T even have a single 'umm' or 'err'&nbsp;or 'uh-huh' in the whole conversation  So damn tedious I think, and make me sound mechanical.. a few days ago, a caller thought she was speaking to a machine instead of a human being... huh!  And ya know what? every week, they sit down with ya, listen to the voice recordings of your conversations (picked randomly) and fill up this checklist. then they give u a score, and that score bloody goes into your appraisal.. which determines your bonus.... SUCKS!!!

      THE WALLFLOWERS LYRICS  "One Headlight"  So long ago, I don't remember when That's when they say I lost my only friend Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease As I listened through the cemetery trees  I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn The long broken arm of human law Now it always seemed such a waste She always had a pretty face So I wondered how she hung around this place  [Chorus:] Hey, come on try a little Nothing is forever There's got to be something better than  In the middle But me & Cinderella We put it all together We can drive it home With one headlight  She said it's cold It feels like Independence Day And I can't break away from this parade But there's got to be an opening Somewhere here in front of me Through this maze of ugliness and greed And I seen the sun up ahead At the county line bridge Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead We'll run until she's out of breath She ran until there's nothin' left She hit the end-it's just her window ledge  [chorus]  Well this place is old It feels just like a beat up truck I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn Well it smells of cheap wine & cigarettes This place is always such a mess Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams I think her death it must be killin' me  [chorus]

      it's been awhile since the last post.. lots of things happening..especially at work. performance appraisals, meetings,restructuring....u name it.. took an off day yesterday..juz to take it easy.. well, work ain't that bad, especially coz i got really nice people in my team. I suppose call center agents really have to stick by each other, or else things can be a real drag at work.  enough bout work.. today i'm juz chilling at home..surfing the internet.. especially for mobile phone reviews.. yep, i'm looking for a new handphone to replace my 3310. Reason being my 3310 has gone a bit bonkers.. talk to someone for juz a few minutes and the thing goes dead. I've juz changed the battery and same thing happens again. *sigh* problem is, i don't know what phone to buy. Heck, I haven't even decided on my budget yet. On the one hand, I feel like giving myself a well deserved treat and buy something really feature packed..but on the other hand, i'm thinking, should i waste so much money on a handphone?? *sigh* don't know bout that.  Hmmmpphh...have to clean the house afterwards. starting to become a pig pen. till later!

      Well, I've come back from my short break and it's back to work! I had an excellent time with my parents and grandpa back at Baling (My hometown). I spent the first two nights at my parents' Fruit Orchard in Kalai (about 60km from Baling), helping them to pick up durians and to pick other fruits like mangosteens and rambutans.  Had some nice chats with my mom, and like magic, she managed to set things straight in my mind...without even knowing she did it. That's a mother's power. And my dad, as usual, his funny self. Always make me laugh :)  My grandpa is as healthy as ever, although he's over 80 yrs old. Pretty amazing old man.  Well, as i said, back to work!
