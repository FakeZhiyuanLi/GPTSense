      I'm having a root canal done tomorrow. I've always thought the term sounded vaguely like a highway contruction project and I half expect orange cones to be placed around the area  -- along with men in hard hats. That would be nice. I've never had many problems with my teeth. That's changing. Apart from having wisdom teeth removed, this is as serious as it's ever been. Getting old sucks.  I've been trying to read a book. It's not easy because I'm trying to actively avoid parts of it and get to parts I like. It's a rare (for me) nonfiction book and is called "She's Gonna Blow." Sadly, it's not sordid at all, but actually about mothers dealing with anger and frustration towards their children. It's written in that breezy, I'm-just-like-you, sort of way -- perky, warm, friendly. Okay. And the author's Christian. That's fine. My friend (who lent me the book) warned me about this, since I'm not currently Christian myself. She said it was still a good read, and gave her some helpful ideas. I don't know, the religious aspects are pretty dominant. It's more about forgiving yourself for screaming yourself hoarse by realizing God will understand and forgive you. That's nice. But I need to understand and forgive myself. Does he need to do it first?  I don't know. I'm tired and SB just cried out in his sleep. I think he has nightmares. I think I need to try and seduce the Sandman.

      I never get used to the unbridled, monkey-like chaos that is produced by small children. Tonight, while Math was giving the children a bath, I went downstairs. I went into the bathroom. We affecionately refer to it as the "West Virginia campsite" bathroom, since the previous owners of the house seemed to have worked very hard to give it that look. It features a half-installed, fiberglass shower stall, with the shower head fixture emerging from a ragged, gaping hole in the wall. The peel-and-stick, insta-linoleum floor is oddly mottled with grey, for reasons I've tried not think about. There is a towel rack which was hung at a puzzling, rakish angle.  So two things strike me as I turn on the light. One, there is a empty toilet paper roll on the floor. I just put a fresh one in here yesterday. There is also no toilet paper to be seen, except tiny, incriminating shreds stuck to the floor. Two, there is a powder-blue sippy cup floating in the toilet. By some miracle the water looks clear. It's a bit like a crime scene. What happened to all the paper? Was the cup used to annoint the comode after the final flush of the paper that had been methodically disposed of? I'll never know, as I didn't have the energy to quiz the demolition duo. These are the same two who, several evenings back, careened around the living room  --  one with a plastic bucket, one with a laundry basket -- on their heads. They were shrieking with laughter and knocking into furniture and each other. The bucket made the careening more difficult since it provided zero visability. The basket at least had open slats to see out a little bit.  Of course, they fought over which one would wear the bucket.

       There's no logical reason to dye one's hair. It's just hair. Dead cells. But I do so love red hair dye. It's as if inspiration and fiery spirt have been injected into every follicle on my head from a small box with a photo of a woman that beckons me. The sharp chemical smell is familiar as it oozes brown and jelly-like onto my head. I'm flowing and giddy with this absurd shade. No gentle auburn here, no sweet strawberry, but serious, don't-fuck-with-me red. Like a rudeness, a flat edge, a solid thing. Red.
