      Like 20 minutes ago I made soup for myself, and me being the blonde at heart that I am, tripped and spilt a little of that EXTREMELY hot broth on my hand, and by that little drop I screamed and dropped the entire cup and ALL of it went on my hands. I have welts all over both my thumbs and on my knuckles. Yeah, it did hurt. A lot. So after crying in the bathroom with my hands BEAT red and everyone in the house sleeping, I calmed enough to make more soup since I had the munchies really badly lol... and yea now I'm here, eating my semi- warm (thank goodness) soup and umm... yeah. Any news, you ask? &nbsp; Why yes, &nbsp; Moving to Georgia now. Bought a house down there. Going to school with my cousins, and I'm most likely going to be the only new yorker in that entire school so I'm guessing everyone is gonna know who I am. This is great NO one likes "Yankees". I hope i don't get chased by a hillbilly in overalls holding a pitch fork ^.^ wowie am I stereotypical or WHAT! Well we bought plane tickets for August third and yah, that's when we're moving down "south" &nbsp; Oreo is out like a light thank god.. she was terror all night since she slept most of the morning. WE FOUND DOMINICK! Lauren's obsession was discovered today.. i told her those skater boys were going to Dominick's house and Dominick came out from his house with that nice little Mercedes in the driveway lol &nbsp; Okies I'm gonna go and put bandaids on these marks. They are gonna start bleeding the more I type. Bye!!!!!

      He's trying to get me jealous with that ugly, fat discussing friend of that slut!!! Ooh yeah nice try but it didn't work out the first time you did it with *nameless* the, dare I mention, fat herpy giving whore!!!! Nice try.. really.... but what pisses me off the most is that Bianca puts it out in the open like I would really give a shit. Haha that's priceless, really. Asshole.  Anyway...  My birthday sucked. I was ignored by my mother and my brother and since my father won't give my mother any money for "retarded" things that we don't really need around the house, we didn't do nothing. So I went over Lauren's house and we had a little mini party thing, and yeah, that's that. The cake was really good and so was the fruit smoothies, lol.  School starts in little over a month. This summer BITES. There's nothing to do... I can't wait until I get my license when I move. Then I'll be able to drive back to New York and we can all go on a road trip or something. ^.^  I A M  G O I N G  T O  G O  N O W  B Y E  !  K   A    T     I      E       !

      Hey hey. Um.. yesterday I went to the aquarium with Lauren and we petted sting ray's and when you ignored them they'd flap their wings and wet us. And I got to pet the black sand shark, and it's body felt so weird. Yeah so after taking funny pictures and looked at everything IN the Aquarium (including these ostrage looking birds Emus.. I think.., and parrots) we ate at this small restruant where this band Cloned was playing and they were really good and I felt bad cos no one was really there watching them, so I clapped after every one of their song and then they gave us their CD and we listened to it on the way home. Yea.. then we pranked people lol  Hi is Rick there? Hi Rick!  Hehehe... that old man was really cranky because we called at 11 pm and I guess he was in the middle of either sex or sleep. Okay sooo.. at 4:20 a  bunch of us are going to go see King Arthur and um, then I guess we're gonna take the train back to howard beach and hang out there. Yeah. I want McDonalds or something really fattening. I haven't been eating a lot lately so I'm going to spoil myself lol. Did you know I only weigh 98 pounds. Doesn't look it though. Ahhh.. i think i'm going to go and occupy myself before the movies.  "Somebody told me, that you had a boyfriend, that looked like a girlfriend, it's no convendential, I've got potential."  *hiccup*  ... go away

      Oreo is my mother's advocate. She is bad to sleep with too, always pushing you off the couch or putting her nose under you and then you have no choice but to move so she doesn't suffocate. >.  Where the hell is everyone?
