        I just read this and I really enjoyed it and it gav me a bit of faith.  So, here it is:         You Still Love Me     Sometimes When I Wake Up     I Wish That I Had Not     Because This Worlds Got Me Feeling     Like I'm Not Worth A Lot          But Even When Im Feeling Down     And Think I've Lost My Way     I Turn To You Lord     And I Kneel Down And Pray          Lord I Know To The World     I May Not Be Good Enough     But You Help Me To Stand Tall     Even When Life Gets Rough          In This Life It Seems      LikeI Always Fall Short      Of Being Worthy     But Lord In My Heart I Know     No Matter What You Still Love Me          No I'm Not Perfect     And Yes I Do Wrong     But You Stand By My Side     And You Help Me To Be Strong          Lord I Know I'm Blessed     With All Your Love I've Been Given     And Even When I Make Wrong Choices     I Know That In Your Eyes I Am Forgiven          Even Though The World May Shun Me     I Know I've Still Got You     And Everyday I Go On Living     As You Keep Helping Me Through - Emily Strickland

       I havn't heard from you, and I doubt I ever will, but yet I still patiently await that e-mail reply. I sorry for all the pain I might have caused you if I had caused you any. If I could go back in time, and answered your calls for me, then I would. I havn't been able to get you off my mind, but I think it is time for me to let go and move on. So this will be my good bye. Although you will never read this, I guess I am just saying goodbye to all my memories of you. I will miss you. But, I will say it now, Goodbye.     Woot! I am home alone for the weekend. PARTAY time!!!! ;)

        Everything was going ok until last night.  I finally felt a bit happy for once-until last night.  Why do things like this happen?  It was good though. It brought back memories.  It brought back a part of me that was numb.  Now I know that hopefully everything will be alright.  So for that, I am thankful.  It also put away most of the pain I was feeling.  I just hope it can continue all well.

        Fuck you.  Thats all I have to say to you right now.  O, and your an Asshole.  You don't just walk out on your family like that.  That was real mature of you.  Well, it doesnt really matter anyways i guess, because you can't lose somthing youve never had, right?  Well I don't even want to bother with any of this anymore.  Screw you.  I don't need to handle this.  None of us do.  It was your own fault.   And now you will suffer from it, because you are missing out on a lot-especially me.  Hope you have a good life drowning in our pain that you have caused us.

       Have you ever had to make a decision, that took all your heart to decide, and when u have finally made a final decision, you receive an e-mail or a letter that will make think everything over again? Well I have, and let me tell you, it sucks!!!  It took me 7 monthes to be sure of this, and today i received an e-mail  Well it really bites the rats ass. I am now back to the same place I was in February.  So now the past 7 monthes of thinking and staying up all night because of it, was all a waste.  Because I am in the same place.  I don't know wat to do now.  But I guess there's not too much more I can do, so I'll just leave it up to fate, or watever it will be that will make my decision.  O well.......watever.

        Just thought I would run over my week....          So-heres wat happened. -Beware-its boring as hell!          Sunday: Burnt me a couple CD's for my trip to Osoyoos. YAHOO          Monday: Saw the Notebook for the 3rd time with my aunt, cousin mom and sister. It was still good. And I bought a book!!!!"A Widow for one year". Its good. I went to Nicky's to say bye to her cuz she left for Europe on Tuesday. Then I went home-WOOT WOOT!          Tuesday- Nicky left for Europe. I also just sat around and did nothing, so the usual. I also burnt another CD. Haha.  Wednesday- Caitlin and I made plans for thursday!!! And I went to my friend, Sam's house for Dinner. Her and I reflected on all of our memories together, and missed eachother. I wish I never moved. O, and that day Danny was over. Haha, you will always know when Danny's here-without even seeing him. Candace will be dresed up, and all show-off like. It's funny. haha-Candace made him sum food, and asked me if she was using a Microwave oven or a COnventional oven. You would have had to been here to know the humor of it, because, yet again she gave us all a good laugh.  Thursday- Caitlin and I saw the NOtebook. I still loved it. But Caitlin didn't...hmmm...does she have a heart?lol-jk caitlin. I had fun with her. Then I went home, and my grandma and my uncle came over for dinner. We had a nice time.          Friday- Hmm......I sat around-doing nothing like always. then Chadd called at about 8ish. We talked for 3 hours or so. Haha it was funny.          Saturday.....that's today. Nothing has happened so far. And I doubt anything will. Nothing ever does. So I will sit here, patienlty awaiting some kind of event, and if something happens, then i will write about it.          So there is my week. Boring as hell, i know. Sorry to whoever reads this.

        Here's another poem I found....           My own destiny     With the one person I love    feeling so much pain,    how can I ever be free?   I see him suffer,    but what can I do,   I am as helpless as he is   , if not a bit weaker.    With my family against me,    how can I succeed?    All I hear are complaints,   of how I’m not doing things right.    Will they ever learn,    who I really am?    I know the answer   but I hurts to say.   I can not accept the truth.   I will always be sorry for crimes    that i did anything but commit.   It is all my fault even if i was never there.    I am a slave to this world,    as I always give in,    but I feel I’ve done wrong    when I do as they say.    Where can I go?    There is no place to hide.    I am lost in their maze.    If I go the wrong way they    will punish and scold me.    There is no prize at the end,   only eternal pain,   and there is no escape to my destiny,   I am told.    If I fight they will hold me tighter.    If I agree they    will create more rules and harder tasks.    Either way i am in their hands.   I’m theirs to punish,    to scold, to chase.    I will never be free.    I will always be in these chains.    I can not run,   from my own destiny.
