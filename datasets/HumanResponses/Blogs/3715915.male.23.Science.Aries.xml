      CURRENT MOOD:   anxious CURRENT MUSIC:   ben folds, emaline NOTABLE QUOTE:  "well guys, it's been a blessing." ---------------andy, last night in town.  i've always hated marshall.  from their stupid little campus, to their dinky little bars, to their attrocious mall, right on up to that one plane crash that killed the whole football team.  i just can't stand the place.  wvu has many many many hilljacks, but the kind that go to marshall were always a bit lower on the podunk hierarchy.  the dorms are ridiculous with their 'high-security'  stations at every door.  just let me fuck my damn boyfriend alright??  anyway, i now have another reason to hate marshall, and you do, too.    the herd stole jesus.    yeah, that's some bullshit.  andy left today for huntington.  wow.  i didn't think it would hurt this bad.  the summer has been filled with zingers, fun stories, and loads of laughs thanks to andy.          actually wait.  it's been filled with those things thanks to all of my friends.  i can't give all the credit to andy, though deserving.  this needs to be addressed to everyone.  probably should have said this some time ago, but better late than never.  today marks 6 months ago that dad died.  it also marks 6 months ago that i learned the most important lesson that i've ever come across.   you never wait to tell someone how you feel.  i've spent the better part of the day feeling sorry for myself.  yeah it hurts, but today is about much more than that.  i would've died this year if it weren't for my friends.  instead of wallowing in my misery,  i need to be damned thankful for the people that i've surrounded myself with the last few months.   these people have been my rock and have maintained my sanity in the aftermath.  i owe them so much and i hope that i can be half the friend that they've been to me.   i feel like i've abused their priviledges during the last 6 months.  i promise these next 6 months will be different.

      CURRENT MOOD:   nervous CURRENT MUSIC:   REM NOTABLE QUOTE:   1.  "just because they're reading the bible doesn't mean they're not looking at your boobs." ---------me, to erin, trying to convince her to go to church to meet boys. 2.  "dude, if they're that age and going to church, they're going cause they love the lord." ----travis, to me, on why going to church to meet guys is futile.     nothing new.  just had to post the quotes.   oh yeah, remembered some camp booze stuff now that my head isn't quite as cloudy.   lessons learned:  bear + marlow+ miller lite+bush v. kerry debates + gay marriage+ abortion = never should have fucking happened.  sitting by a fire and having everyone list their favorite movies/actors (val kilmer)/bands/cds/songs is just awesome.  definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  that bitch that was running somewhere between bridgeport and the woods had to been retarded.  no one runs with that bad of form.   i should have known that i wouldn't be able to complete my camp booze experience without thanking thomas.   one should always think before they say anything.  i should never drink more than one glass of wine at a time.  if you're going to play poker and/or asshole, make sure someone has a rule book.  ("what do you mean 5s are fuck you's?  what the hell does 'fuck you' mean?"..."it means drink, bitch.")  towers made of miller lite cans, although completely necessary and awesome, fall very easily.   especially if drunk bitches try to set up a tripod around them.          that'll do, donkey.  watch for pics and roman's wedding news.  yea monogamy!   lani.

      CURRENT MOOD:   happy from shopping. CURRENT MUSIC:   eternal flame----bangles.  no idea why.  just kinda popped in there. NOTABLE QUOTE:  "i don't know whether to ask her how her day has been, or put her in the game." ----------------travis, on terri, a lesbian at work.     recently seen on bret's blog:  "Also, have you checked  urlLink Alana's  website for an update? I smell a worker bee who's too lazy after work to update with all the quotes from the weekend."                you're goddamn right.      so yeah, camp booze was fantastic.  i waited 3 days and i still can't process what all went down.  the cabin that we picked turned out to be huge and had a wonderful rustic ambiance that lent itself to babbling brooks and fresh air.  or something.  we bought food/alcohol beforehand, which was funny cause my mom jules had to buy the alcohol for us cause she's the one with the sam's club card.  she looked like jt's mom buying 210 cans of miller lite.   since it's all kind of a blur (damn that wine), i'm just going to list some quotes that we kept and perhaps a few little stories that i can remember.   memorable quotes:    i'd want to be robert deniro's son cause then i'd be knee-deep in pussy.-------scott.  i'm not a good-looking guy, so i have to TRICK the girls into doing me.------scott, more drunk.  everyone gets nausious when they get in the hot tub with me.---------------scott, almost dead.  favorite actor:  val kilmer  MIND THE COONS!------andy  their menustration attacts bears.  bret, while cooking, 'i'm fucking bored.' ------'now you know what it's like to be a woman.' --brian  JOHN KERRY IS SOFT ON TERRORISM!!  rarely sober...rarely so-BEAR.-----travis, on bear.  the daddy longlegs...the most poisonous snake this side of the mississippi.-----lani  take THAT america!--------andy  awww, travis, this is our song----brian, after ben folds five's 'brick' comes on.  'yeah, it reminds me of when you got that abortion.' ---travis  oooohhhhhhh.  julia roberts.  gum my pee-pee...with your horse teeth.-------andy  RIVER PHOENIX'S CORPSE.  alana, in reference to julia roberts.  "she's prego?...she's salad dressing?"  jesus, you're up.--bret, to jesus.  'GODDAMNIT!' --jesus  okay, let's talk about doing it.  cause this wine goes straight to my crotch.   ------alana  all i know is that i went over to see scott and when i came back i had sticky fingers.----brian  travis:  i'd totally screw mary from the bible.    steph:  which one?    jesus:  the tight, tight virgin.  i was 14 when i was blowing people, but i was 18 before i had sex.  -------alana.  damn wine.  you cum-guzzling whore...shut the fuck up.----travis, to alana, immediately after prior comment.  eatin' ain't cheatin.'  sara won't be here until tomorrow.------bret  nah, man.  i ain't givin' her a yeast infection.--------bret  being the jesus is like being in a boy band.---------andy, in response to questions about his sexual partner number.  i'm getting nailed here...--------------jesus  you can either write it down in the quote book, or act on it.---------luke.  HEY OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!!  camp booze anthem 2004.               funny stories:  bear was single-handedly the drunkest person i've ever seen for 3 days straight.  he doesn't have a liver, it's a damn sewage system in his torso.  also, on the ride home, bear was shaking like a motherfucker.  way more than usual.  and i think he only smoked 2 cigarettes.  weird.  even he was surprised.  andy was dared to run naked from one part of the deck to another part, very far away.  he did it.  i saw a divine ass.  great memory.  never bring jack johnson to a camping trip.  bret and alana make the best burgers in the world.  99 degrees is the perfect temperature for a hot tub.  one of my best memories from the camp will be when we first woke up each day and had some coffee.  really a good time to be with most of my closest friends.  awwww saps.  i've never smoked so much in my life.           alright, that'll do it for now.  i'll post some pictures sometime tomorrow, (IF PEOPLE SEND THEM TO ME).  and then this weekend it's off to roman's wedding with my date, dean dean the sex machine.  should be fun.     alana 'it's embarrassing to read quotes that i said that i don't remember saying but i'm pretty sure i would have cause all the wine that i drank makes me lose all concepts of appropriateness or however the fuck it's spelled don't make fun of me i'm a really good speller though it wouldn't seem like it from camp booze" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:   happy CURRENT MUSIC:   the sound of crickets chirping.  motherfuckers. NOTABLE QUOTE:  see below.   ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS FOR MARCO POLO:  "cross!"..."jesus!"  "donkey punch!"..."alana!"  "cleveland steamer!"..."alana!"  "lord of the..."balls!"  "my sweet baby"..."girl!"  "marco!"..."faggot!"  "marco!"..."sparkles!"  "marco!"..."i'm over here!"  "spiderman!"..."gonzo!"  "rim!"..."job!"    so over the last couple of days we've been swimming at scott's aunt's house.  really fucking cool.  for some reason, even though the youngest among us is 21 years old, we can't get enough of marco polo.  the first day it was all innocent, but apparently scott and james figured out that they can grab my boobs and blame it on their eyes being closed.  whatever.  at least you're trying to get some.  i was starting to worry.  CAMP BOOZE IN 2 DAYS!!!  oh snap!  very excited for the trip now.  i thought only a few would be going on thursday, but turns out that just about everyone will be there that night sometime.  except sara.  and you can TOTALLY bet that she's going to have to give everyone hand jobs as soon as she gets there to make up for her absence.   just read the weather report.  says the highs for the weekend will be in the low 70s.  not bad.  wouldn't mind a bit hotter, but at least we won't die of heat exhaustion.  everyone, plan accordingly.   STILL NEED CAR INFO FROM BRET, SARA, LUKE, NATALIE, MAYBE NOAH.  sidenote:  way bummed that jt and james can't go.  we'll take loads of pictures for you guys.     so once the booze hunting trip is over, we have roman's wedding next weekend in morgantown.  i have 2 new dresses for the occasion, one for the rehearsal dinner, and one for the wedding.  i look outstanding in both.  looking forward to making out with roman's hot engineering friends, if such a thing exists.  but really, it will be nice to be apart of roman's big day.  i think he and amber make an excellent couple and will enjoy a wonderful life of hugs, smiles, babies, and timeless catch phrases.  WEEEEELLLL.  aight.  off to bed.  big day of cpr training with tnut, erin is coming in for the booze experience, and the food/beer shopping spree at sam's.  probably won't blog until sunday night sometime.  check back for camp booze quotes and pics.  much love.  alana "blame it on my vagina" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; a little stressed CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; s. carter NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; "if i had been at the convention, my thong would have been on the stage."---------------me, talking about clinton's speech at the democratic nat'l convention.  &nbsp;  so yeah.&nbsp; i'm a little stressed out over this camp booze business.&nbsp; a few have pulled out, so instead of the 16 or so that i planned on, we have 13.&nbsp; of course, the 13 may change as well.&nbsp; fuck.&nbsp; i don't know.&nbsp; people suck.  &nbsp; other than the money issue, i'm still looking forward to it.&nbsp; a long weekend in the woods with every single good friend that i have is just freaking awesome.&nbsp; i'm hoping to take a shitload of pictures, so bloggers, be sure to check my blog around the 8th.&nbsp; among pictures i'm sure you'll see:  &nbsp; noah in a speedo by the hot tub. bret, never to be outdone, stark naked in the hot tub. travis, hoping to relive old times with brettles, stark naked in the hot tub. andy in his robe and crown of thorns. brian humping the grill. natalie looking at the hamburgers in disgust while searching for her soy dogs. erin never leaving the stupid loft thing that she won't stop talking about. brian humping the tv. luke trying to hook up with the lifeguard at the lake. luke getting kicked in the balls by the lifeguard at the lake. luke bitch slapping the lifeguard at the lake. steph making out. brian humping the hot tub. bear watching steph make out. travis by the tiki torches, voting me off the island.  &nbsp; and thaaaaaaat's pretty much it.&nbsp; work is good.&nbsp; i like it.&nbsp;   this weekend should be fun.&nbsp; it's dan's last night in town, james is PAYING someone to work his midnight so he can come out, and brandon is coming in.&nbsp; if you're in the MOV, give us a call.&nbsp; friday should be a fun, expensive night, and saturday looks like it'll be a great night for poker.&nbsp;   i love my friends.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; alana "nigger in a bottle" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; still sleepy  CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; stevie  NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; "those tits feel good against my arm."------jack   &nbsp;   since i am incapable of putting together coherant paragraphs and sentences, i am just going to list some random thoughts i've had this weekend, regarding work.&nbsp; enjoy.   &nbsp;  wow, never noticed how many commies buy cases of beer at 4 in the afternoon (at the compak store with the alcohol, coke, xanax, crank and crack abusing clients).   if i hear one more comment about fucking on a washing machine during the spin cycle by the fat, degenerate, delusions of grandeur-having cook, i'm going to cunt-punt somebody.   do you think cats have substance abuse problems, too?&nbsp; some of these cats look like they are using.   i don't give a flying fuck about your sons, nancy.&nbsp;   bill st. clair doesn't look like bill st. clair.&nbsp; he looks like darrell hammond doing an impression of bill st. clair.   i miss being around normal people.&nbsp;   when kammy says 'pie between the thighs,' it hurts me.   it's gotta suck to be a dolphins fan right now.  when nelly tells me to&nbsp;'flap my wings,'&nbsp;&nbsp;the first thing i think is, 'roast beef doesn't flap.'  surprisingly, the mountaineer has&nbsp;good corn, while mom can't make cole&nbsp;slaw for shit.  that guy from maroon&nbsp;5 is the most fuckable guy i've seen in a long time.  just exactly how many movies has mel gibson been in where his wife dies?  think you need references to get hired at sugars?  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and yes, i know i've been talking about amity a lot.&nbsp; give me a break.&nbsp; i can't help it.   &nbsp;   more later.

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; tired CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; another one bites the dust------queen NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; ''you know gonzo was a jew, right?" -------nick, on muppet babies.  &nbsp;  so i spent all weekend working at amity.&nbsp;&nbsp;not too bad. &nbsp;just about everyone i work with is cool.&nbsp; i worked 13 hours today so i could look good for the boss, hopefully it worked.   my first PI (public intox for the layman) was at 10 in the morning on a weekday, so that was refreshing.&nbsp; had some real sentimental value for the little shirtless dude who called his grandmother a fucking bitch.&nbsp;   my first crisis call went incredibly well, considering he refused to give me any information yet informed me it was MY duty to tell him confidential shit.&nbsp;   my first argument with a client also went well, and by 'went well' i mean that she didn't get too far with her incessant bitching.&nbsp; jt topped it off nicely too.&nbsp; i set em up, he knocks em down.  &nbsp; i realized today how much we need jt and travis.&nbsp; since jt has been working midnights and travis was out of town for roman's bachelor party (WEEEELLLLL), it's really sucked not being able to hang out with them.&nbsp;guys, come home.&nbsp; we need you.&nbsp; andy misses you.&nbsp; james misses you.&nbsp; and i miss you.&nbsp; it's just not the same.&nbsp; the mountaineer is fun and all, but it's missing travis' endless banter and jt's comments about burn victims.&nbsp;  come home...  and speaking of friends not being around, where the fuck is natalie now?&nbsp; has she made it to montana, or fucking ontario?&nbsp; UN ACCEPTABLE.&nbsp; give a bitch a call.&nbsp;   STORIES I HEARD TODAY: one of the cook's sons beat up his roomate for being a faggoty rapist. the other cook has an affinity for serving raw meat. jt can eat raw meat and not get sick.  &nbsp; okay, i'm dying for some sleep.&nbsp; work 3-11 tomorrow, then a reunion with the boys.&nbsp; finally, some people who aren't fucking crazy, at least clinically.  &nbsp; alana 'i read an AA book and now&nbsp; i know everything' raines
