      Hey everyone....im really confused about life right now.......i dont know what im doing....its so confusing....i mean...i feel like just throwing my life away while i still have the chance..me and my "mother" are going to ride the ferry over to Frisco....i could just jump off there and drown..that would be so nice....then no one would miss me....everyone would celebrate....anyways...everything is going wrong in my life right now..i mean i keep having this dream that someone is raping me...i think that's the scariest thing in the world...only b/c something happened to me a while back...and i would talk to someone about it, i mean...i already have, but we're having some issues right now...and i dont think this would be a good time to talk about it....but then again..i really need to talk to someone, but no one [and i mean no one] can understand me....only he can.....:( well, ima go be ALONE now...alrighty talk to yall laterzzzzzzz...

      hey...whats new with everyone? i think imma be postin on here for a while..ya know...so i can get away for a while...the only bad thing about this site is that you cant put pictures on here like you can on xanga...lol...gr! so yeah..thats my new nickname....mOndO_dOrkster...hmmmmmm....should i make a screen name for it? nah..not right now....hmmm...i think ima take a break from everything...ya know...like sit back and study my life...thats my job for the summer i guess...**looks away feeling retarded** anyways....i odnt remember how i came across this site builder...but yeah....i was on google looking up...hmmm...what was i looking up?? oh yeah county research...and then i came across this site thingy...so i made my own....cool huh? well, not really..this site builder is basically a wannabe xanga...lol...the only thing its missing is the picture...gr! oh well, i guess i can treat this one like my mind...i mean, ill just type whatevers on my mind at the moment..but on xanga ill just type how ever my day went..so yeah...welcome to my mind...lol... pretty empty huh? yeah i know...gr! this stupid site builder doesnt have a guestbook either...well, at leaset i dont think it does....lol...oh well....lets see...im sick and tired of taking all this bullshit from my parents....i mean they have their petty little arguments and then i have to be the one who hears it the next day....wTf? i hate it! so i just tune them out...i mean i think my mind is headed for total shut down...that would be nice huh? i just walk around here like dead weight...then no one would have to worry about caring for me anymore...this guy that goes to my school wrote this poem about how he feels about life..talk about depressing...i think that when you use harsh words describing you own life..then you've got serious problems...so now..i guess i made another new friend...lol...but im still sad because i lost my bestest buddy..the only one who understands me..well, actually..they're just mad at me...but i feel like i lost half my body or something...gr...well, i think i besta get goin...so imma leave you with one last thought...
if your best friend and you got into a fight...and the next day they died...would you forget it ever happened? or would you thank god they died?
