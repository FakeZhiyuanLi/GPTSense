       As many of you are aware, today was the first day of school for sevier county students. Well, lemme tell you guys a little about my day. Anna and I have all our classes together this semester. First, we have Combined studies: English, then Combined studies: ancient history, next up is Latin followed by band. We have D lunch, this would be bad, but we are allowed snacks in Latin. We have an interesting mix of people in our combined studies classes, and I think it will make for a very, very interesting semester. So, in first period, we have Mr. Hodges-he is really cool in that he treats us like adults. For second period, we have Mr. Schnietman-he is really into chivalry, and then we have Ms. McCarty-she's just really fun. Band is fun, but Doc has this "Celebrate Freedom" or whatever show and that means that we have to have Miss Smelcer, which wouldn't be so bad, but Seth moved all of our stuff out of the newly adopted(for the fall) majorette room so he could put his stupid tuba-that should be at his house so he can practice at night-in there. He made a fuss about it and we got kicked out. Currently, we have no place to put our baton cases, which presents a problem b/c we buy our own equiptment-which isn't insured and cost a lot of money. We can't put them under the table b/c someone will get into them and break someone or something; we can't put them in the guard room b/c we wouldn't be able to take them home. Miss Smelcer doesn't want us putting our stuff in that room, even though Doc said it was ok. So now, it's really gonna suck not having Doc in fourth period. Later on, I started drinking my soda only to find out that I had accidentally been drinking someone else's-I don't know who. I wanted to vomit, but I virtually have no gag reflex. Ah well, tomorrow is another day. buh bye

          Hey son, just posting again because I have no life.  School is just one day away and I am actually excited-creepy.  I just came in from twirling fire batons, and oddly, I got mobbed by mosquitoes (normally, I never get bitten).  I'm pretty psyched about the first game and pretty nervous.  I have invited Anna to join me in parenting my "baby".  She should join in soon enough.  My classes for the first six weeks are, in order, Combined studies:Enlgish, Combined studies: history, Latin I and Band.  I am excited to meet new people this year, especially new guys, no one I know at the moment meets my standards and vice versa, I'm pretty sure.  However, I am confident that this year will not be like last year.  I smell like lamp oil and smoke.  Well kids, I'll post again soon, so not to worry, I'll make sure you don't get lonely and discouraged.  ta ta!

       Hey kids- how goes things? Well, I am now officially part of Carolyn's blog, and yes, i feel "uber" special... So, Carolyn wants me to introduce myself. Well, I'm Anna Y., i just turned 15 august 9th, i'm italian/german, i play the clarinet (aka clarry) in band and a few things on the keyboard, i'm currently listening to foreigner's  "i just died in your arms tonight",  and i have a sister angie whos currently dating a polish kid, so naturally we disown him..j/k and oh yes, ill be a sophomore this year.. fun fun... Hhmmm... and the answer to the previous question is that all those actor kids starred in a brilliant movie:  "Igby Goes Down."  and of course I thank Aleisa and Ponder for recommending it bc it was really good (and hey, congrats on you two)-so if you kids like sad, depressing movies with funny, i guess ironic taglines, and you also have an immense hatred for growing up, I think this is your movie. . . In other news, twas Carolyn's mommy's "birfday" yesterday, and on friday, me and Carolyn started our shopping adventure. which that was nonetheless fun and tiring. ok, so friday, i meet carolyn and her mummy at the middle school, and i help clean "PRIDE BOXES"-then we went to RUE 21 in pigeon forge-we saw Jenna there and said hey to ashley who at the time was on the phone with Jenna, and i must say, that place is addictive. it had to be at least three times that Carolyn's mom went back to the register to buy something new that we had seen-but hey, that place has got neat stuff. cough like my italia jacket that Carolyn got me for "birfday" which was last week (thanks carolyn! and priscilly for my baskin robbins ice cream maker!lol) and hey, Carolyns "rub 4 luck" underwear is always entertaining... and then we went to the Belz Mall so i could look at some Levi's jeans (ha, didn't find any) and before hand me and carolyn wandered into that really neat purse/jewelry store, which has the most awesomest stuff there for good deals- and so, i got my new pink and black handbag there, and I got carolyn her "italian" ring and bracelet. then, it was off to Fuddruckers for dinner, where carolyn experienced many difficulties trying to keep in her chair, and staying focused one subject, and keeping her eyes not crossed...lol yeah.. and then we see "David", Carolyn's one true love-which, granted he looked 19, but still, those kids were made for each other, especially since they both share a passion for bubbles... then twas off to my house, where we experienced the art of painting nails, and learning that you should always keep a door open due to the strong fumes of that stuff-but anyways, the midnight hour passes, then comes 3 o'clock, and me and carolyn decide to bother the many insane people out there who find no humilation in being in a hilary duff chatroom. and so, "man", we announced the sad and tragic death of everyones beloved Rick James, and no one seemed to care-that caused an annoyance. then, as time passed, me and carolyn found great amusement in randomly saying to the trendy teenyboppers of our time, "in my pants".. somehow, they thought i had an obsession, and i assured them and said no, its merely an addiction....then we go to sleep at 4:30, but we had to wake up at 9-which was pretty brutal, but all for the love of shopping.. so, we left my house around 10 maybe?, and went to pick up Carolyn's mummy.. so, off went me, carolyn, angie, my mom, and carolyns mommy to West Town.. so we shop there, and find some great stuff-and some enjoy the fun of "dress-up"-although we got alot of weird stares from the people passing by... oh well, it was fun... and we go to Hot Topic, experience the bizarre there, meet a very impatient, yet gentle lad who worked there-got a "frequent shoppers card" and hey, i finally got a  DONNIE DARKO  t-shirt, bc as you all know, im pathetically obsessed with that movie.. hhmmm..what else was there.. oh yes- we go to ruby tuesdays, and by this time, angie and carolyn i think were getting tired of me commenting on all the very attractive guys the mall of West Town has to offer, but geez, what wonderous waiters that fine restaurant has..lol i mean, they had a adamo ruggiero older brother knockoff-and even better: a Jordan Catalano knock off... yes, anyways... then we leave the grand halls of that mall and head down to kohls, where we find some cool stuff like angie's "chilly" penguin jammy pants, carolyn's "mr. bubble" jammy pants," and my "care bear" jammy pants. ... but no, that doesnt mark the end of the adventure-after we dropped carolyn and her mummy off, we stayed for probably about ten minutes and enjoyed the opening of mrs. hogans present from her wonderful son: michael hogan.. well kids, have you heard the news? carolyns marrying my cousin trevor, and im marrying michael so we can be related-tis a perfect plan... well, its been fun sharing you carolyn and my adventure, but, i must leave you for now-until next time: "take of yourselves, and each other" -Jerry Springer "We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars." -Oscar Wilde  bye! -anna
