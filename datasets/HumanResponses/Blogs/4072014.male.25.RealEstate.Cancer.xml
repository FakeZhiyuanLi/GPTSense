      Ok, everybody here has to agree with --- sometimes you just have to vent. And we can't all do it the way we want to. Like, when that asshole pulls in front of you on the freeway, narrowly missing your front bumper by what must have been centimeters and then slows his vehicle down. And, he's not driving just any car. He's driving some whacked-up truck that a crack addict must have designed. It's so tall that you can't see around it, you can't pull around him because somebody is now on either side of you, and you're slowing down. These are times when you really just need a good shotgun. But, we all know we can't do that. So, we must vent. Another example is the coworker, friend, employee, client, etc. who won't get off their ass to do anything. Nothing at all. Even though it's their responsibility to do something, they refuse to do it. Then blame you when it doesn't get done. These people just need to be removed from society all together and stop wasting my time. I have had several clients who have done this to me. I give them advice to help steer them down the right path, but they consciously choose to not do it. I can't do it for them because it would be illegal and I don't want to be stuck with the bill. So, I keep advising them, but their ass is stuck to the couch. What the hell? And, when they run out of time, it's my fault. It's about this time that my sentences are composed of expletives and that's about it.   Lately, I've been watching the democratic convention and have been thinking it's pretty funny. I've never seen people say so many words with nothing of significance every coming out as politicians. That's pretty much all politicians. Who wouldn't want hope for the future? I sure do. Who wouldn't want all children to be well-fed, families to be out of poverty, healthcare for all, and everybody to be really happy. But, is this really government's responsibility? Is it their responsibility to provide for me and my family, make me happy, make sure that I make more than the poverty level even if I dropped out of school after seventh grade? I mean, c'mon on. As long as we exist, there will be poverty. There will be individuals, families, etc. who refuse to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them to improve their life. I can just hear the naysayers now, though. But not everybody has the opportunity! That's plain crap. Even the homeless have a place to go to clean themselves up, a bed to sleep in, some food, and the opportunity to get back on their feet. You show me a homeless person who is not at fault for them being homeless and I'll give you a moron.   What's ironic about the Democrats is that they pretend to fight for the little people. However, they are slowly trying to turn us into a socialist society and remove all of the freedoms that this country was founded on. But, hell, let's vote for them because they are raising the minimum wage. Never mind that prices will correct themselves so that your buying power of the dollar is decreased which amounts to your extra money not going as far as before. Or, let's ignore the fact that the vice presidential candidate is a money-grubbing lawyer who made his living suing companies in frivolous lawsuits so that our healthcare and insurance costs have skyrocketed. You think that doctors just happily pay for the multi-million dollar insurance policies they are required to have? No, that cost is passed along to us, the consumer. And, if we have insurance, that cost is passed along to our insurance companies who pass it right back to us with raised premiums. I can't imagine what this country will be like with John Edwards a heartbeat from the presidency. What happens if Kerry dies and while Edwards is President, something doesn't go his way? Is he going to sue? Democrats have already shown that they would sue, and sue multiple times, in the 2000 election (which is another blog and don't get me started on that one). Anyways, back to work.  Sparrow
