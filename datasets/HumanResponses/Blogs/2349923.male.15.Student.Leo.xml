      Okie... I'm one of the members of this blog administration.  So taking this chance to drop some comments.  If you guys have any queries about your drill knowledge or some other NPCC related stuffs, and finds an immediate need to rectify the query.  Do not hesitate to find me in school. SMS me or whatever. By the way, i've now stood down as your NCO. So you are not obliged to show me as much respect as before(basic individual discipline is still required...)  So just treat me as just another friend who is two years senior. I'll be glad to answer any questions you ask, if my memory can heed my wish.  Other than NPCC stuffs, any school work you need help with. You may get to me too. I need pratising on my lower secondary work too... so its a win-win situation if tt happens.  In the meantime, good luck everyone. In your CCA as well as your academic inclinations...

      Okie, good to see the comments column flooding with active comments.  But the contributors are still the usual ones.  Presently, there are only   2 Admin and  6 meagre sec2 cadets.  Please try to rope in more people and get them to come in here regurlarly. The Blog serves as a medium of interaction and it will greatly increase the communication skills within your own squad. So start getting more people in here!!!

      Bro..i guess i post it here so that everyone can see your advices okie..  Try this... 1) before hand preparation- refer to the Command list, then make a rearrangement of them such that the drills fit exactly in a flow of continuous drill parade  Example: sedi-a, ke-kanan lu-rus, pandang ke-hadapan pandang, turning drill, forward march.........so on...  2) mentally, visualise youself doing the commands in front of the squad. Keep in mind, the list of rearranged commands you've done.  3) Refresh the commands. Get a friend to do a check for you(you shout the command, then he/she tick the command as you shout. Sequence is important)  4) Prepare your uniform till tip-top condition(a spotless uniform will earn you more mental confidence when you finish the uniform inspection without mistake.)  5) Mental preparation. Visualise the mistakes that you might make(like missing out on a command, how are you going to slot it back into your sequence without flaws.)and demand a sense of correction for the mistakes.  6) be confident of yourself.  7) prepare for drill commanding, to score a distinction...   Requirements of the test:  1) Clarity of commands 2) Vocal 3) Correctness of commands

      Great, Fabulous, Fantastic, Overwhelming, Superb and simply Marvelous....  These words alone are not yet enough for describing the performance you guys did for the farewell party. The performance, placed in comparison to last year's,&nbsp; is way much better.  Thanks guys. Please do take an approach as serious as this from now on. The teamwork i see is immensly infinite. If it is strengthened even further, you guys will soon become elites of the school. Any more, you might want to go to  urlLink my blog &nbsp;to see my post. There, you can get some pictures.  Well, in the mean time, i want you guys to carry on the great job. And i seriously want to hear good news and comments after each of your parades from your Sec3&nbsp;NCOs.  Talking abt ur sec 3 NCOs, please give them their due respect as if to me. Though my official squad is sec 2, i've trained the sec3 NCOs as whole-heartedly as i've trained you guys. So that they could be at their top form to train you guys. They have worked extremely hard for me, which is for you. So whenever you feel like rebelling the sec threes, think of me and the hard work i've invested in the secondary threes for you.  The current NCO team is a team of outdoor skills experts. And you guys lack in outdoor skills, so this is the best configuration you can get.  Good Luck!

      Hi everyone!  I'm finally back in Singapore. Sorry for the late blog as me been too tired to blog. Aniwae, actually I didn't went that far as what I said earlier on. Initially, me and my friends thought of going a western country but in the end, we went to Malacca and have fun at A'Famosa WaterWorld Theme Park at Alor Gajah (a place in M'sia). Aniwae all of you should try to make a trip there as it is much better than the one Singapore have at Pasir Ris Wild Wild Wet and East Coast Big Splash! Btw here are some of the pictures I took at the Water World Theme Park.         Family Raft Slide          The dinghy          Nerve-racking High-Speed Slide          Me doing the slide          Body Slide          Me and my gang(all attached already)    So who knows one day we might go there together?Any takers???

      Hi! Everyone!  This blog seems to be inactive at the moment. I myself dont know why. Maybe perhaps one of the reason is because we keep on seeing the same people coming in here. Why is it that some of the sec 2 cadets choose to be ignorant about this. Where is the spirit of the Sec 2 squad which I used to have. I know some might give me a simple reason of no internet connection at home. But if you are really on about NPCC and also the pride of the sec 2 squad, surely you will find a way to get into here at least once. Either by going to the library or even use the school computers to get in here. Hopefully I get to see more of you guys in here okie..Please.  Anyway, I'm here to update some of the latest changes in the squad okie. Its got to do with the post for IC and other posts as well. Here there are..    Squad IC - Cpl Hanisah Asst Squad IC(1) - Cpl Brenda Asst Squad IC(2) &amp; Treasurer - Cpl Syed Abdullah Programme IC - Cpl Wong Yee Meng Attendance IC - L/Cpl Chu Sin Yi    So from now on, instead of approaching Carla and Yee Meng, please approach the newly appointed ICs okie. Carla and Yee Meng, you guys have done a great job for the first half of the year. Thanks a million especially for organising those BBQ party and also the picnic we had the other time. Thanks.
