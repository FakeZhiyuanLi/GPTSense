						       A Prayer Attributed to St. Francis     Lord, make us instruments of your peace. Where there is hatred, let us sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy. Grant that we may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.    This popular prayer from the great St. Francis represents a view of salvation that I often miss.  Salvation, for St. Francis, is found in what he does for others, not in what is done towards him.  By offering others condolence and pardon, St. Francis finds condolence and pardon.  By praying for God to make our lives instruments of peace, we find God's peace.  Peace is found when peace is given.  But we keep on living for ourselves, believing that by bettering ourselves we will save ourselves.  We pray for God to save us and give us the blessing of heaven.  But off in the distance, in the pages of Church history, we here the prayer of a man with bleeding hands.  A man who lived his entire life trying to identify with Christ, so much so that he is the only recorded person to have received the full stigmata of Christ.  This poor Saint prays not for God to bring him salvation, but for God to bring others salvation through his life.  That was how St. Francis was saved.

						   I have attempted to start a new blogging adventure called "Blogging With The Saints".  This blog is more for me than for anyone else, though all are welcomed to read and comment.  For a while I have desired to spend more time reading the great masters of Christian spirituality.  I have decided to begin a blog focusing on that discipline.  My plans are to regularly read various writings, sermons, and prayers from Christian saints and spiritual masters and journal about those writings on the blog.    I value the saints of the Church.  I believe our Protestant heritage has neglected an important part of Christianity.  My own free church tradition has REALLY neglected the benefits that comes from studying with the saints.  These women and men gave their lives to serving God and His church.  They have left us with words that direct our attention towards the Almighty and His desire to be in relationship with His people.  Hopefully, this blog will draw your and my focus back on these spiritual masters who have run the race before us and won.

						       Today is the feast day for St. Mary Magdelene.  Mary Magdelene is honored today because she was a faithful follower of Christ.  Unwilling to leave him even at his death, Mary joined the other women at the foot of the cross while the Apostles fled.  Mary was also the first to witness the resurrected Christ on Easter morning.  Many traditions have developed about what happened to Mary after the resurrection.  Among these traditions is the following:   Tradition relates, that in Italy Mary Magdalene visited the Emperor Tiberias (14-37 AD) and proclaimed to him about Christ's Resurrection. According to tradition, she took him an egg as a symbol of the Resurrection, a symbol of new life with the words: "Christ is Risen!" Then she told Tiberias that, in his Province of Judea, Jesus the Galilean, an holy man, a maker or miracles, powerful before God and all mankind, was executed on the instigation of the Jewish High-Priests and the sentence affirmed by the procurator Pontius Pilate. Tiberias responded that no one could rise from the dead, anymore than the egg she had brought could turn red. The egg turned red immediately, as testimony to what Mary was preaching.  (Notice the red egg she is holding in the icon.)   urlLink Read more  about her.    Almighty God, whose blessed Son restored Mary Magdalene to health of body and of mind, and called  her to be a witness of his resurrection: Mercifully grant that by your grace we may be healed from all our  infirmities and know you in the power of his unending life; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and  reigns, on God, now and for ever.  Amen.

						   From the   Sayings of the Desert Fathers    Abba Lot went to see Abba Joseph and said to him, 'Abba as far as I can I say my little office, I fast a little, I pray and meditate, I live in peace and as far as I can, I purify my thoughts. What else can I do?' then the old man stood up and stretched his hands towards heaven. His fingers became like ten lamps of fire and he said to him, 'If you will, you can become all flame.'   This is, perhaps, my favorite of all the   Sayings of the Desert Fathers  .  To be honest, I'm not sure I really understand it.  I'm not sure I understand many of the stories and sayings about the Desert Fathers.  But I relate to Abba Lot.  Often I feel like I'm doing good.  I'm praying regularly, in the word regularly, practicing spiritual disciplines regularly.  Still, there is a longing for more.  "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"  Abba Joseph seems to be pointing Abba Lot beyond the mere practices of Christianity.  One could pray all the hours of the daily office, meditate, be peaceful to all and have pure thoughts, but if these practices do not change the person into the image of Christ, they are for naught.  To become "all flame" is to become all one can become of God.  To fully particpate in the divine nature.  To become what we desire.  The goal of the Christian life is to be transformed into Christ-likeness.  This is the "more" of our longing.  To be like Christ is to become what we were created to become.    We can do all the actions of Christianity and never become anything beyond ourselves.  But if we will, we can become all flame.  We can become the people Paul describes in 1 Corinthians 3:18:  "And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit."

						     Previously published on  urlLink Travis' Blog    As a seminarian, I am familiar with the various textual debates and theological issues that studying the book of Genesis bring up.  I have sat through lectures which attempted to twist the creation story into a scientific account, showing how the Bible is a science text book in disguise.  I have thought about whether the 7 days are literal, or figurative; whether the garden of Eden was an actual place or an allegorical parable.  But you know what I have not done.  I have never been to the Garden of Eden.  I have never experienced the joy of Paradise.  I have never been embraced by this awesome story of God's love and provision.  That is why the word of St. Ephrem (a 4th century Syriac Christian) touch me:    "I read the opening of this book And was filled with joy, For its verses and lines spread out their arms to welcome me; The first rushed out and kissed me, And led me on to its companion; And when I reached that verse Wherein is written The story of Paradise, It lifted me up and transported me From the bosom of the book To the very bosom of Paradise."                                     --St. Ephrem,  urlLink  Hymns on Paradise   5:3   He knows something about reading the Holy Scriptures that I do not.  St. Ephrem, like the other early readers of scripture, were not interested in literal/figurative debates or questioning authorship and sources of the text.  Through their study they transcended critical study and reached mystical experience.  They were able to, as my Professor  urlLink Dr. Childers  said recently, be caught up in the awe and wonder of it all.    Oh, that I could stop treating the Bible as an ancient artifact to be dissected and debated.  I pray that I can imitate this great Saint when I study scripture, allowing myself to be "lifted up and transported" into the very bosom of God.

						    Abba Macarius was asked, 'How should one pray?' The old man said 'There is no need at all to make long discourses; it is enough to stretch out one's hands and say, "Lord, as you will, and as you know, have mercy." And if the conflict grows fiercer say, "Lord, help!" He knows very well what we need and he shews us his mercy.'   From the Sayings on the Desert Fathers  Why do I always feel the temptation to utter "long discourses" when I come to God in prayer.  It is as if I must say it in order for God to know it.  If God knows my heart, why must I act as if I need to reveal to God what he does not know.  Maybe prayer is more than simply offering lists of requests to God.  Maybe prayer is as Abba Macarius suggests, a simple "Lord, have mercy" or "Lord, help!"  Are not these prayers?  Is not the person in grief who utters, "Why God!" engaging in an exhausting prayer from the heart?  Is not the person at wit's end who utters, "Lord, I can't do this anymore!" in fact offering a sincere, humble prayer of release?  Jesus tells us of two men who go to the temple to pray, a pharisee and a tax collector.  The pharisee offers a long discourse, proclaiming his worth and requests to God, thankful that he is not a sinner like the tax collector.  The tax collector, humbled by his own unworthiness, utters the simple prayer, "Lord, have mercy on me a sinner."  The tax collector goes away justified.  I am burdened with praying lists to God.  I am tired of long, "eloquent" prayers, begging God to intervene in the world I have screwed up.  I am ready for simple prayer--prayer from the heart.  Prayers that, in a few words, remind me of my utter dependence on God.     "I cannot do it."   "Lord, Help."  "Why?"   "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."   "Thank you."   "Forgive."   A heart can be opened up and laid exposed before the Lord in a matter of words.  May we flee from the temptation of thinking God only hears drawn-out sentences and eloquent requests.  May our hearts be filled with simple, yet deeply penetrating, words of dependence on God.

      1) Last week was VBS at our small church. We bussed in about 70 or so kids from area apartment complexs, feed them nightly and tried our best to show them the love of Christ. I had the opportunity to teach in both the 3rd/4th grade class with my wife and in the adult class. My wife is a good teacher! It was a good, but tiring experience. While we enjoyed it, I can't say we are ready to do it again anytime soon.  2) Free advice--if you can't get 3rd and 4th graders to pay attention to what you are doing at VBS, offer them sugary candy. Works like a charm.  3) Marti and I bought fish. We've had a fish bowl before, but the little guys kept dying off. Now we are the proud parents of 7 little goldfish and one little snail in our new 10 gallon aquarium. They are really cute kids. My favorites are the one who is missing his right eye and the goldfish who has big 'ole bubble cheeks that make him look like a hamster who has just packed his cheeks full of food. They are a lot of fun!  4) Check out Q's recent blog. Very interesting thoughts on the questions of God and women. Don't condemn her for her questions, but praise her for having the courage to ask questions that many of us will never ask. It has long been said that doubt is the road to faith. Questions are the language of faith. One who refuses to ask questions about their faith, refuses to have faith.
