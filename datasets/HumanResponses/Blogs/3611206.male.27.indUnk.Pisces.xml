      I was watching television today, which admittedly is not in itself an unusual thing.  However It did lead me to a realisation of sorts.  I have noticed that recently, as in over the last year or two, programme makers have been spending less and less on making the actual programmes.  The advent of reality television is the prime example obviously; where they fill the screen with wannabe amateurs that they don’t have to pay, as they systematically spend days, weeks and in a few cases months, destroying their chances of being employed in a normal job for the rest of their natural lives.  They will no longer be known as Janice from Tesco’s checkout, or Bill from the garage; but will instead be remembered only as, the fat mouthy one off… or that guy from…that fancied the fat one. I think you would have to be either disturbed in the mind, or an idiot to the nth degree to be caught dead on one of these programmes.  This kind of fame can only be the worst kind of publicity that could not possibly leave them with anything better than a few humiliating bit parts on morning television.  What kind of a life is that?   The other thing I noticed was the new obsession with lists.  Every other programme on every other channel seems to be a collection of the top ten best pop stars, the hundred greatest movie stars of all time, the greatest song ever in twenty easy steps, the fifty largest genitals on the planet…EVER!  These lists puzzle me for several reasons.  The first is why the people they employ to comment on the various choices actually agree to do so.  They are expected to have an opinion on everyone and everything, and it is clear to everybody that half the time they have never even heard of these people.  But more mystifying is that they agree to do it, even though it is a clear death knell announcing the end of their poor, un-industrious careers.  You would never for instance see Robert De Nero making some puerile comments about Michael Jacksons Pants being number eight in the fifty greatest trousers category.  I also wonder who it is that decides these lists.  I am sure they would like me to believe that it is based on a vast collection of facts collated by a large group of dedicate university professors, who have spent hour upon endless hour collecting the opinions from an enormously diverse demographic in order to ensure the most accurately compiled lists ever.  At least that is wht they would like me to believe.  I am sure the truth is something far simpler.  A group of half pissed juniors with a hundred scraps of paper arguing over the decisions with a joint of purple haze in their left hand and each others genitals in the other hand.  Nice work if you can get it.  It does amaze me to the point of being almost impressed how they keep coming up with more and more ideas.  They can always come up with something new.  But I am waiting for they day that the inevitable happens, and they come up with the final, ultimate list of the top ten best ever, never to be beaten, lists ever.  It works though.  We all sit there glued in moronic states watching this shite, and don’t even seem to care that it is merely a cost cutting exercise by the networks, and as long as we keep watching, we will never see a decent programme ever again.  But there is no beating them, so I thought I might as well join them.  My list of the top ten most annoying things…EVER! 10.     Ignorance 9.	Teachers that are incapable of doing. 8.	Bunny Boilers 7.	Politicians that are incapable of giving a straight answer 6.	Pointless lists 5.	Liberals that don’t know anything about real life 4.	People who claim to be accepting, but in a disapproving way 3.	More pointless lists 2.	People who say ‘At the end of the day.’  Before every f@@**!g sentence! 1.      Football bores!

      The love of personal tragedy creates an interesting, confusing, and overall melodramatic personality.  Do tragic people encourage a tragic life?  It seems that the people hat moan endlessly about their own tragic existence are never able to take the blame for their own actions. Hiding behind a trait of pathetic apathy is mostly transparent, and weak as an excuse for the idleness of the mind.  The nervousness sometimes seems to contrived to be real! How can somebody seemingly so shy be able to broadcast that fact with such a loaded and unmistakable clarity.  It couldn’t possibly be their way of getting attention from the bleeding heart population, or is it just an excuse for being a useless individual too lazy to learn how to do anything properly!

      I have had to sit tonight and bite my tongue so hard I almost choked on the resulting blood; and it will be weeks before I can talk properly again.  There are very few things that will lead me to this reaction, as I am not generally one known to be sitting on the fence on any occasion, but you can guarantee that the sounds of women talking about men will do it every time. I am sick and tired of hearing about how ‘All men are bastards!’ and how we need to be treated like some kind of child Neanderthal kick back from history.  We are grouped together as one mass of bare consciousness and endlessly spoken about like we always need to be humoured rather than listened to and our opinions considered.  There are dozens of magazines all preaching the feminist bible where men are idiots and women are the keepers of idiots, and very few men ever take it upon themselves to defend their position because they are terrified of being called a sexist, and an oppressor of women.  Oppressing men however seems fine.  Well women of the world, this is for you.  Here a few truths that you always seem to overlook when casting your judgement over the male population as a whole. All men are not bastards, and although there are many stupid men in the world, there are an equal amount of stupid women to counterbalance them.  Men do not need to be patronised, and their opinions are just as valid as yours are.  Not all men can be judged by the last boyfriend that you split up with; just like you cannot be judged by the last girlfriend that we split up with.  Sexism is not owned as a piece of offensive behaviour solely by women, and can be just as offensive to men.   Some of you ma be confused by that last sentence, so I will clarify it.  If I was to open a men only club where women were not allowed to enter, I would be vilified by the female population as a sexist bastard of the highest degree.  Yet I see every day, dozens of women only clubs, gyms and organisations, and not a word is uttered about the sexist nature of this.    From a personal point of view, I am not a bastard.  At least not in the sense you all mean when you name the male population as such.  I have never cheated on anybody in my life.  I have never forgotten a birthday or anniversary.  I always clean up after myself.  I love cooking, reading, writing, and cuddling up with somebody to watch a nice film with a glass of wine and a take out.  I love treating my mate to romantic gestures spontaneously, and without reason, and I love receiving the same in return.  I even take my turn to sleep in the wet patch.  And I am not alone.  There are thousands upon thousands of us out there that do not fit into the bastard categorisation.  Perhaps then, with this being the case, instead of taking a broad brush and painting 50% of the world population with it, you should instead stop for a moment and question your own judgement. All men are not bastards.  You just pick the wrong ones.

      I swear that these people were put on this earth to taunt me.  Just me! No other person on this planet has as much bad luck when it comes to these repugnant leaches on my already waning sanity. Every single time I have to be somewhere, they insist on getting there before me, but much, and I mean, much slower.  Old people who can’t see straight, or worse, can’t see at all.  Old people whose joints are so utterly wrecked that they cant move their arms or legs at any worthwhile speed.  Old people whose hearing only works on Wednesday afternoons when the air pressure s slightly lower.  Old people whose blood pressure is so high, that every vein, artery, and capillary is visible through their transparent school toilet paper skin.  Old people whose minds are so addled that they think that Jesus was a parliamentary dignitary, and that their families genuinely mean it when they say.  ‘Oh!  Its so good to see you.  We mustn’t leave it so long next time.’  When in truth all they really want you to do is die and leave them some money to spend on pornography! When they get to this stage we should start taxing the oxygen they breath, and find crooked homes to send them to so they can be beaten into submission.  But what do we do instead, in our infinite wisdom, and ability to fuck ourselves up the arse at every available opportunity; is give them all driving licenses.  And if this wasn’t bad enough, we then allow them to use them, by giving them access to the most dreadful of all automotive guides, the Rover catalogue.  Ill let that settle in for just a moment. These people who are scared to even go fast enough to worry a knat on the windscreen, and consider slight bends on the motorway, a major navigational operation, are actually sold, and indeed even encouraged to buy, Rovers.  A most hated automobile at the best of times.  But when its sold in maroon, and given to people who are a liability to traffic when they are locked inside grey concrete buildings watching coronation street, then we have a serious problem.  Ask yourself this.  We have another group of people in this country that soil themselves on a regular basis.  Would you let them drive a car? They meander around ‘A’ roads so slowly grass overtakes them.  They potter along at a walking pace around ‘B’ roads admiring every tree, rock, and ant they come across, completely oblivious of the 38 mile tailback they have queuing and banging their heads against horns behind them.  The only time they ever reach forty miles per hour is on the motorway.  And then they do it in the middle lane, forcing all the trucks, wagons, and tractors to get into the outside lane to overtake them, causing this time, a 68 mile tailback! But worse than all of this; they do it in front of me!

      Whilst standing in the middle of Watford today trying to figure a path through the hundreds of canvassers, catalogue sellers and big issue vendors, using a rather complicated combination of maps, charts and satellite technology I was also watching the people walking around me, (or through me, depending on the motor control abilities available) and it occurred to me; whilst doing this, that we have never really escaped from the tribe mentality of our origins.  We may have evolved to the point of being able to kill millions of our fellow human beings in less time than it takes to spill your seed on a picture of Anna Kournikova.  But it seemed to me, looking at the people around me that many parts of our primitive make up, like the tribal instinct, have never, and in all probability, will never, go away.  In no section of the population is this more obvious than amongst the teenagers.    The teenyboppers are setting the trends; like a sheep with a perm.  Flat back, centre straight, fringe crop, pink or blond bob, always different only to end up being the same as everyone else.  Trying to look cool is quite clearly a fruitless pursuit, when the only way to look different as a rebellious teenager now is to shop at Marks and Sparks and wear Chinos with shoes. The cross culture bastardisations have become the norm.  Skinny white kids trying desperately to be black, or rather what they perceive as being black.  They do not try to emulate the proud men that fought the way for equality, and worked to be accepted in a foreign country against all odds.  Instead they lower their thinking power as much as the waistband of the overly baggy trousers they wear, and compensate for the reduced blood flow to the head caused by the smaller amount of organic tissue present, by wearing as a very minimum requirement, at least 12 hoods, hats and caps.  I do sympathise with them though; they are so desperately trying to find an identity of their own, whilst at the same time not wanting to stand out from the crowd, that they latch onto the nearest available group that has even the slightest interest is being different.  Unfortunately for them, this defeats the object of a quest for individuality, as to be an individual in a group of similar people…well, do I really need to complete this sentence.  If I do, please stop reading now, as I intend to move into three-syllable territory very soon. Crossing cultures as a base idea does not worry me at all; in fact I have spent a good part of my own life trying to experience as many of our worlds cultures as possible, and actively support the acceptance and inclusion of the best parts of these cultures in order to improve our own.  What worries me is the choice of role model used to create this pollination of the human flower.  For instance, why choose a semi-literate half wit whose only major ability is being able to talk with rhythm and spit with an echo, of which there are hundreds of copies, when there are truly individualistic trend setters and world shakers from the same cultural background that are surely far more suitable inspirational figures for those seeking to be different from the rest.  The letter X comes to mind. I am convinced that what these poor unfortunates are failing to see is that they are fed the idea that to look, dress and act how they do, by the mass media.  Can anyone else see the contradictory natures of this; or is it just me? All minds seeking individualism, and therefore enlightenment, are massed as one in a gross, pungent pit, of pink and brown pond scum.

      I am a virus, a bacteria, a disease feasting on the rotted gangrenous flesh that forms this earth on which we live.  I am a puss filled boil, I am bile, I am a corrosive acid stripping everything of life as I pass over it.   I breed quicker than I die, and kill unilaterally with no good reason.  I commit genocide on entire species several times each year, and I do nothing to stop, or improve, or to change in any truly meaningful way. Like pond scum I suffocate all that is beneath me, and allow nothing else to live unless it is on my terms.  I preach that I am good, and that what I do is for the good of all.  But what I really mean is that it is for the good of me; which I always manage to justify, no matter how wrong I am. My biggest natural asset is based upon the deaths of millions of species over millions of years, which I do not treasure, but instead waste.  I am constantly fearful of running out, but rarely do anything to preserve it. My second largest natural asset is based upon the exploitation and ruination of my own species; which I justify again, by blaming it on them, for them being weak.  It is I who is weak though.  I can only be dominant and strong by exploiting others and killing those who are weaker than me so that they think I am not.  Without them I am nothing.  Yes, its true, I am human, but then, so are you.

      It appears that the new way of making up for past mistakes is to join the wronged, queuing at the gates of hell.  Incapable of being ourselves we are copying the most unlikely of bedfellows.  After not allowing others freedom in the past, we are now removing freedom from ourselves, in some kind of subconscious penance.  The chip on the shoulder bred through falseness and ignorance is starting to weigh us down. It is time to be honest once again.  Too many people are too frightened to be honest about what they are feeling because of the onset of political correctness. They are too scared of being branded as a racist, or a sexist, or a bigot of any kind.  You must all understand many things in order to be free, one of which is this.  PC is pointless crap that stifles our very being, prevents expression of soul kept views and therefore removes our most basic of civil liberties and human rights.  That means our rights as a human being!  We are born with these rights, and political correctness, a device created by a group of people who are trying to crush individuality, (the clue is in the name), is taking these rights away from us.  We have the right to believe whatever we like, and if others don’t like what we are saying, then they have the right to not fucking listen! Here is what to do about political correctness.  Get rid and start seeing the world through your own eyes.  We are not chameleons, we are not us, we are not even you and I.  We are currently the sentients that simply follow one of the hive minds rather than creating our own.  Free yourself from the nest, then, once your free, sit there, catch someone else’s eye, and try to help take them out of the collective unconsciousness.  It is our job to stand on the outside looking in.  I am a true believer of life, and I also believe that through a combination of laziness and ignorance, we are not living it; this is not it. It can’t be.

      As I look at the world I always seem to despair.  We don’t have control anymore.  It used to be the intelligent 20% that controlled the open mouthed masses, but now it seems to be the richest 2% using the lowest common denominator to control the country.  Those who are truly individualistic are controlled through censorship and ridicule, whilst the Sun readers are left to feel superior through some kind of backwards psychology.  Bill Hicks summed it up when talking about small town America in the 80’s.  He was sitting in a waffle house reading a book when the waitress came up to him and uttered the immortal words, ‘What you reading for?’ A fat lard soaked amoeba of a trucker type lifting his obnoxious bulk around to observe in his own particular way followed that. ‘Looks like we got ourselves a reader.’ I don’t think I need to explain the meaning of this any further, suffice to say that 20 years ago the anti-intellectual movement was firmly in place in America; fed by mass media controlled by the true leaders of their country.  What worries me now is that in Britain now, we are in the same situation.  The only intellectuals we are bringing up in our comprehensive school system now, are so badly ridiculed that they usually end up putting their creative powers into developing new and interesting ways to commit suicide, or slowly killing as many people as randomly as possible before being locked up for life, and then developing new and interesting ways to commit suicide.  Often using highly intricate knots when tying the sheets together.  The only people left to develop their minds now are in the private school system, and are related to the controlling population, and are therefore already controlled.   Do you see the pattern that forming here.  Football is king, and true individualism is dead.  Long live the tyrants.  This is my journal, kept as a last bastion of hope in a hopeless world.  I feel that the only way to combat the stupidity and ignorance of the blinkered masses is to recognise it, log it, and force people to read it.  Preferably on threat of having their skin removed and being rolled in vinegar. Enjoy.

      To look at the title of this interview you may assume that I did not like the interviewee.  You could not be more wrong.  It has been a while since I have met somebody as refreshing as to be unafraid of public opinion, and not feel the need for people to see her life set in the norm. I sat opposite a girl of twenty-three called Angie, her mass of black hair held in a style that would have left the best rock guitarist looking dull.  Her body language was turned heavily inward, hinting towards her social inabilities.  This meant that your first opinion of Angie is of a shy girl with not much to say for herself, but the truth is, when asked, she will be an open and entertaining person.  For example when I asked her what her dream house would look like, and who she would be sharing it with she gave me one of the best answers I have heard.  Instead of the usual nice house and adoring husband reply I have heard so many times before, she wanted a house from the country, with old stone walls, small cottage garden, lots of bare wood; which isn’t in itself unusual, as many of us will have similar dreams.  What is unusual is the fact that she wants this house in a city, surrounded by oblong soulless high rises, where it is least likely to exist, and where it would stand out the most.  And whom would she live with?  Why a small army of cats, who she adored in various colours, regimented and trained to chase away, and no doubt preferably maim the local children.  Angie though would be playing a definite second fiddle to a small angry young black cat with a white nose called Mable.  And what is wrong with that? Nothing.  Animals are always far more reliable than people, and given the choice I would follow a similar path. Her ultimate ambition it would seem is to be the mysterious spinster that all the local kids are convinced is evil.  But she is not evil.  In truth she just enjoys being the character that is ok saying and doing the things most of us only think about.  Something to be admired indeed.

      I arrived at the scene of a fire at eight thirty this morning, and stood and joked with the manager of the business smoldering before us about the extremes some people will go to to get a day off. It was a bizarre situation, where a woman's hard work had been comletely destroyed, but her reaction was to laugh.  I have to admire her really, I very much doubt I would have been more than a blubbering wreck in her situation, but then I always do take things too seriously.  We sat down in a nearby cafe and ignored what had happened as if it were something as simple as a two year old child screaming for attention.  We talked about her future plans, about what special offers she was going to use to bring in the customers, and the child simply seethed in the background.  I wish her well.  I can do no less. What was amazing was how she reminded me so much of the 'Karen' tribes of Northern Thailand, with whom I spent some time a few years back.  As a spoiled westerner I had arrived in the area expecting to see nothing but poverty and misery, as these people were renowned for having little or no paid work.  They lived n stilt houses that had to be rebuilt every year, and the whole village shared one squat toilet, and one shower.  I remember that the shower was a series of split bamboo poles reaching high up into a spring situated in the woody hills surrounding the village.  In order to clean yourself after a long day suffering the 95% humidity that was common there, you would shower in this water alongside the pigs that craved the muddy area, which for me was atruly unique experience.  So yes, there was definitely poverty, but I can honestly say that I have never seen people so devoid of misery.  The children played with a large dried seed taken from one of the many tropical plants growing in the area, and the men and women laughed together sharing some unknown joke.  In the evenings they would sing, dance and tell stories, doubtless heard hundreds of times before, but never tired of.   I spent quite a few months after leaving this place trying to work out what it was they had to be happy about, knowing that most people from my world would be desperately unhappy living like this.  Then I realized.  They didn't spend any time at all worrying, or thinking about what they didn't have, but instead realized what they did have.  To them, they had all the riches they would need, and had not been poisoned by materialism.  I for one hope that they never lose this as it was magical to witness, and I long to experience it again soon.

      Faint cheers in the background told of the matches progression as I sat quietly alone in my garden, small and high fenced all around, listening. A baby cried two houses to my right, and an owls hooting told of the coming dusk.  These hints of tranquility never reached realization as the sounds of traffic broke through every moment of silence available. Above me and airplane whined on its descent, returning from somewhere I would rather be.  Seemingly deaf, my housemate turns the television up to a level that causes Al Puccino to act as a repellent to all self respecting wildlife.  Another cheer is heard.  We might have scored, but I find it hard to feign an interest.  A car bounces along the nearby road forcing me to hear the occupiers taste in music, and suddenly I long for the sound of diesel engines again. There are two patches of daisies on my lawn, which I can see past the umbrella like washing line.  They stare at me like two big white eyes on a background of patchy green skin.  I wonder how they got there.  Is this perhaps where the slugs that enjoy free reign in our living room at night, perform some kind of intricate  mating ritual, and these small patches of beauty are the residual result.  I hope so.  It would be nice for the slugs to serve some other purpose than to ruin our carpet. The baby keeps crying.  Perhaps it is tired or windy, or maybe it shares my own allergy to the abrasive sounds surrounding us, and can find no other way to express it. I think back to the time I spent in the high Atlas mountains in North Africa and try to remember the quiet nights I shared there.  Aside from the donkeys it was without doubt, bliss.  It would be nice to live somewhere so tranquil and yet so full of life, instead of this soul less place.  I spent some time in the Lake District eight weeks ago, and it was a calming influence to realise that I would not have to leave this country to achieve this.  We do live in a beautiful country.  It si just such a pity that we insist on ruining so much of it.

      I have just spent a night out on the town in Watford.  Any of you who have even the slightest modicum of intelligence or free thought will know that this is never a really good idea.  On arrival I was greeted by the site of two giant inflatable footballers, hollow shells filled with air, which made a very interesting point.  The streets were full of people on a mission in tight trousers and stripy shirts, whilst the girls wandering around were testament to the fact that clothing should NOT be optional in Watford.  Hipsters are designed for people who do not have hips, and belly shirts are designed for people who do not have bellies.  The sooner people realise this, the sooner my eyes will cease to be offended each time I walk through a town centre.  The music pumping from the overpopulation of bars and clubs was a master class of how to destroy a song in less than three minutes.  Simply treble its speed  and add an incessant throbbing thump over the top to hide the lyrics aside from the occasional shrill warble that makes every fibre of my nerves stand on end. I decided to visit a bar called Bodega’s, which in all fairness was and excellent bar, without the usual loud music, and designed in a very social atmosphere that was crowned off by a glacier of wax that had been allowed to form on the large stone fireplace in the centre of the room.  It was a place that is a rarity in our current society.  It was a place that you could interact and hold a conversation with people whilst not having to gag on the smell of overly hormonal urine each time the toilet door was opened.  I liked this bar, and would have stayed longer had they not charged me £4 for a single drink.  I then took a short walk down to a non-Irish Irish bar called O’Niels where I learnt that the lowest common denominator keeps buying bigger and bigger shovels.  There were enough red crosses to make an international war zone jealous, and no less than eight large televisions showing 22 overpaid spoilt men running around after an air filled pig bladder.  The men in the bar simply stood transfixed by the green filled screens, praying that the power would never go off, in case they should have to talk about anything other than foot ball.  The drinks were cheap, and served lovingly in a dirty glass, but you could actually feel yourself getting stupider and duller with every minute you spent in this atmosphere. I have never understood the appeal of football, and have always been more of a fan of games such as rugby, and cricket, which encourage unity and force the watcher to use their minds to follow the more complicated rules and strategies used.  Football it seems actually causes the watcher to revert to their ancestral state, as the brows lengthen, and the testosterone pools.  I had to leave this place rather quickly, as I didn’t think my personal survival would have been an option after more than ten minutes.  If the ape men didn’t get me, then the salmonella certainly would. I was at a bit of a loss after this, as all the other bars had formed queues outside them that would have made the food dispersal in the former USSR seem civilised.  The smell of road kill was wafting through my nostrils causing the bile to rise somewhat, and I hadn’t had enough to drink to consider a club fun.  So I was forced into the only option left available.  I looked at my watch, yawned, and went home to have a large whiskey, and a long drawn out conversation about who was the most attractive tennis player on the telly with one of my housemates.  No matter where you are in the world you are, civilisation will always be waiting for you somewhere.

      The longer it happens, the harder it is to deal with.  The longer it happens, the harder it is to get out.  The monotonous beat of the music serves to remind you of your solitude, the eclectic rhythms mixing with the singular base heavy throb whenre you cannot.  People call you a loner, and you have to remind them that it is not through choice.  Then you have to remind yourself, that it is not through choice.  The test is keeping your sanity. I am not sure I am, otherwise why would I be talking to myself.  I disguise it by saying I am writing to you, but the only you that exists is me, and we are both alone together.  The three girls sat opposite to me look over from time to time.  Do they wonder who I am?  Or do they simply question my lone state.  It doesn’t get any easier this thing you know.  This loneliness thing.  This tormentor of my mind.  I think it is possible to spend too much time with yourself, I think I may have done this already.   I seek voices, even of strangers, just to fill my void.  I seek to sit at the tables of others, but fear the rejection that may come.  It doesn’t get any easier, this loneliness thing.

      I have just recently returned from a small trip to Lincolnshire where I was reminded of something very important, that people, including myself, forget all too often.&nbsp; I often write about the negative things in society, trying to tackle the meaty, and ultimately irritating issues that affect our day to day lives, which could lead you to believe that we live in a country, or indeed a world that has gone to shit.&nbsp; But like I said, I was reminded of something today.&nbsp; I was reminded what a beautiful country we live in here.&nbsp; I was driven through the countyside to a lake, where I was taken out on a boat, and I was stunned by the beauty that we hold here.&nbsp; I reflected back on my previous homes in Lancashire and Cumbria, and I remembered hapily how beatiful parts of both of these counties are, Cumbria standing up against any other part of the world as a place of peace, and outstanding nature; so much so that I insist on returning there at least once a year to recharge the old batteries.&nbsp; I think that we as people generally, and in particular Londoners, and people who come to England just to visit London, thinking that that is what represents us, are missing out on what we really are.&nbsp; We are a people that live on an island containing some of the nicest, friendliest people, living in some of the most historic and stunning places on our earth.&nbsp;  Thats about all I was thinking of over the last couple of days, but for those of you that are missing my usual visceral style, here is something ofor you.&nbsp; We are missing a trick with big brother.&nbsp; We should allow as many of the people that apply to go into the building, lock them in, and then get on with our lives happier in the knowledge that there are fewer attention seeking morons to cause trafic accidents in the world.

      I rarely drink, dont like football, and refuse to read newspapers with political allegiances.&nbsp; This makes me strange in some way.&nbsp; I was recently told by my boss, that I was expected to join several colleagues on a team building session water skiing and overnighters by a lake in Derby.&nbsp; I quite like the idea to be told, but said that as I was not going o be drinking I would prefer to stay late, but then drive home to spend the night in my own house rather than sharing a dingy caravan with several other people.&nbsp; The response to this was quite unexpected, and also quite offensive.&nbsp; I was told that it would not be accepted that I would not be drinking that evening, and that I should at the very least pretend to drink beer, whilst really sneaking off to tip it down the toilet.&nbsp; When I asked why I would want to do such a dishonest and ridiculous thing, I was told that I would have to do it to fit in, and that seems to be the crutch of it.&nbsp; I have to like football, believe everything I am told by the government, and get pissed on a regular basis in order to fit in, to be accepted as a normal part of society.&nbsp; Well quite honestly, to put things in a preformed reprisal that fits the argument in an intelligent, and not easily misunderstood way, fuck you.  If I have to pretend to be someone else to be accepted, then I am hanging with the wrong people; but this is not the point I wanted to raise today.&nbsp; The thing I was able to gleam from this was that we are actively being encouraged to become part of the ignorant masses.&nbsp; I listen on the news about kids who kill other kids because they dont fit in, and about families that terrorize their communities, and are simply called by the police notorious.&nbsp; It is no coincidence that these two groups are connected in some way.&nbsp; We are allowing ourselves to fall into a place that means we are treating these incidents as isolated, and standing there saying things like Oh its so awful.&nbsp; And That poor mother.&nbsp; But not actually doing anything about it.&nbsp; Well, my question to everyone is, why wait until things get worse before taking some drastic action.&nbsp; We must do something to stem the possible trends of thuggery and bullying now, instead of ten years down the road, moaning that nothing happened to stop someone killing your son, daughter, brother, sister, niece, nephew or friend.&nbsp;  I am not somebody to sit here and say we have to do something without coming up with some ideas to help; so here goes.&nbsp; I dont feel that there is any coincidence in the fact that it is often several generations of notorious families that cause the problems, and that they are very difficult to deal with; so here is my first suggestion.&nbsp; If somebody is convincingly convicted for thuggery, murder, rape or other serious crimes then they should be sterilized in order to remove their right to reproduce.&nbsp; If they are minors the they should be sectioned under the mental health act, and treated for the poison that is running through their minds.&nbsp; I believe that these two acts in conjunction with each other will do more to reduce crime and fear than anything else.&nbsp; Ask yourself; how likely would you be to attack someone over some petty argument if it meant that you would forgo your right to have a family for good.&nbsp; And for those who already have children, we should allow them to be adopted by the hundreds, if not thousands of wonderful couples who are not able to have children through no fault of their own.&nbsp; How likely would you be to pick up a baseball bat to hit somebody around the head with it if you knew it would cost you your children.&nbsp;  Oh the bleeding heart liberals.&nbsp; I can here them now, crying about the potential loss of human rights to the criminals in society.&nbsp; Well Ill answer you like this.&nbsp; I dont care about he rights of the people who are going to cause me, or anybody else to live in fear.&nbsp; I dont care about the rights of people who have no respect for other peoples safety or well being.&nbsp; I dont care about the rights of people who dont follow the laws of our society, and force their anti social behavior on to us.&nbsp; And I dont care about the rights of people who offer nothing back to their communities, but pain and suffering.&nbsp; I do care about the rights of people to live in their houses safe in the knowledge that their families are not going to be beaten up in a random act of violence.&nbsp; I do care about the rights of people to expect to be protected from violent people.&nbsp; And I do care about the rights of children to go to school without fear of being hurt, bullied or killed as a result.&nbsp; I know that the ideas I have suggested may seem extreme to man people, and I am not naïve enough to expect them to be acted upon.&nbsp; But the gist of it is this.&nbsp; People who dont care about other peoples freedom can not be intimidated by the loss of their own, and often they relish the idea of going to prison because it enhances their dubious reputations.&nbsp; The only way to stop them is to hit them in the same way they hit the rest of us, and that is to remove the things they care about the most.&nbsp; Their familes, and their children&nbsp; I is up to us to give the best possible chances to the children involved; both those being victimised by the antisocial families, and those born into antisocial families, and leaving them as they are is not the answer.

      Sorry that its been so long since my last update, but I had some friends visiting this weekend, and it gave me the opportunity to play tourist in London.&nbsp; I had a good time, going to the Saatchi exhibition, which, apart from Tracy Enis' weak attempt at making a point through sheer laziness and lack of imagination, was excellent, and I would reccomend it to everyone; but be prepared to leave mentally exhausted.&nbsp; A couple of things about the London creatures that I did notice though, were not so nice.&nbsp; I could not get over the sheer attitude that seemed to exude from the pores of the obnoxious, ill mannered, self obsessed freaks of nature that lived there.&nbsp; Where I come from, when you bump into somebody accidentally, you apologise and carry on with your day.&nbsp; You do not turn, sneer, and look down upon the person you bumped into as if the were a pile of mutated excrement.&nbsp; You do not pretend that the incedent never occured and proceed to bump into another sixteen people on the way through to your destination.&nbsp; I was led to believ throughout the day that Londoners just dont give a damn about anybody but themselves anymore, and it made me sad.&nbsp; It is of no wonder at all that society is breaking down to pander to the lowest common denominator anymore, when the people who should be setting the role model, are a bunch of ill mannered assholes.&nbsp;  As I sat in the coffee store next to the London Eye chatting with one of my visiting friend I allowed my eyes to roam through the crowds trying to find some hope for the London people.&nbsp; I eventually saw a couple of people smiling and being pleasant to the people around them.&nbsp; I saw a couple of people making the effort to speak to people, and to apologise when they got in other peoples way, or accidentaly bumped into them, which admitedly is impossible not to do in such a crowded area.&nbsp; Then I realised why this was the case.&nbsp; They were selling tickets to the exhibitions, which means that any person not apologised to, or not treated in a nice normal humane manner, was a potential sale lost.&nbsp; Now I have travelled all over this country, and several others to boot, and I have never experienced such a black and white phenomenom.&nbsp; In London, they will only be nice to you if you are giving, or a re likely give them something.&nbsp; If you are not in this category, then they will simply wish you didnt exist, and move on with their own lives.&nbsp; So as I sat there, enjoying the beatiful weather, looking at the beautiful views, after digesting the beautiful pieces of inspiration in the galleries, I watched the livestock moving around in the filth they created for themselves, and held no sympathy.&nbsp; Is it no wonder that we are a hated race when we will only be nice for money.&nbsp; Is it any wonder at all if people outside of our capitalist bubble, are reluctant to be drawn in, and would rather, kil or be killed than join the livestock battling for the last bit of food, and walking all over each other to do it.&nbsp; Before we start wars based on the idea that other people are not as evolved socially as we are, we should perhaps look at ourselves first, and take a step backwards to where our evolutionary state meant that we were a society you would want to be part of.

      This is a question that could be answered in many different ways.&nbsp; You could for instance say what most people would say, that the president of the united states is the most powerful person in the world, but we all know that he or she are simply puppets nowadays for whoever put up the money for the election campaign; or in the current situation, their daddy.&nbsp; You could also say that Professor Hawkins is the most powerful person in the world, because nobody is smarter than he is, and he is able to comprehend things we didnt even know existed, but that would be a dream that would never come true.&nbsp; How about the premier of China?&nbsp; He controls the largest percentage of the worlds population, has the largest army, and nobody wants to piss them off nowadays.&nbsp; But no, he has no power either.&nbsp; Its definately not the British prime minister, or any king queen or premier around the world.&nbsp;  So back to the people who pull the Presidents strings in the USA.&nbsp; Maybe one of them is the most powerful person in the world.&nbsp; Maybe its the billionaire tyrant Rupert Murdock, who controls most of the worlds media.&nbsp; Truth is, he is the closest to it so far.&nbsp; Or, whilst we are talking about money being power, maybe it is our eternal friend and philanthropist Billy Gates.&nbsp; Maybe young Bill has put some thing into the computers he sells that means he is the most powerful person in the world.&nbsp; But yet again, alas, no.&nbsp; Not even that amount of money makes you so powerful. So if its not the premiers, and its not the super rich, or the intensly armed, then that just leaves one group.&nbsp; Us.&nbsp; The simple everyday, go to work, do as we are told, pay our taxes, mr and mrs normal.&nbsp; Because the bastards mentioned above can only get away with everything they do, or anything they do, because we let them.&nbsp; If we decide not to let them get away with anything anymore, then they wont.&nbsp; It is only our willingness to lie down and whine about things, rather than stand up and tell them to shove it, that they can do anything at all with the power we give them.&nbsp; So, if you want to be recognised for what you are, the most powerful person in the world; then stand up and show it.&nbsp; There will be two important elections coming up in the next 18 months, which will be a good place to start.&nbsp;  Oh, and as a little side note.&nbsp; The truth is you can narrow it down a bit more wen talking about the most powerful peple in the world.&nbsp; Its not so much mr and mrs normal, as just mrs normal, because men will always do as they ar told.

      Dont be afraid, you are falling into their trap.&nbsp; We are spoon fed the idea that crime is out of control, and that if we dare even step one foot outside our front doors after sunset, then a horde of teenagers will immediatly pounce upon us, take everything we own, and beat us to death with their history text books.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; We are led to believe that Black comminities are swamped in drug dealers, who walk, talk and dress in ridiculous ways, and will shoot you if you look at them accidently.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; We are led to believe that murder and rape are such common occurances, that we shouldnt even comment on them anymore.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; what is true is that crime is at a higher rate than it ever has been, but then again so is our population.&nbsp; The truth is that the criminal&nbsp;element&nbsp;is now by percentage of the total population, lower than it was in the forties because poverty is lower.&nbsp;  Admitedly there are teenagers that cause trouble, but what do we expect when we fill their minds with such terrible role models, and tell them constantly that they are never going to amount ot anything because very few people do.&nbsp; We should support them in every way we can.&nbsp; If they want to be Britney Spears, or some other truly terrible pop culture idiot, then through your tears of shame you should support them in every way, and if they fail then they will learn by their mistakes and become a wiser more rounded person because of it.&nbsp; If you dont support them, then you are removing hope, and without hope there is no point in being anything other than criminal, because it just doesnt matter.&nbsp;  We are scared out of our wits on a daily basis by the news and documentary channels telling us about all the horrible things that are going on in the world; and quite rightly we should be aware of what is going on around us.&nbsp; What we should not do is let this information control our lives, or dictate our actions.&nbsp; remember, criminlas are not more dangerous, they are just getting more publicity nowadays. Also, for the conspiracy bit, remember who pays money into the coffers of our beloved, and mighty leadership.&nbsp; And then remember what all the murderous dictators in the world have believed, including Autocrat Blair, and Dictator Bush.&nbsp; A scared population is a population you can control.&nbsp; There is no better control than fear.&nbsp; So as a step to freedom, and a movement for each others personal sanity; dont be afraid.

      Revenge of the nerds is not just a pipe dream.&nbsp; After talking to literally hundreds of people with brain cell counts of three figures or more I have come to an ultimately disturbing conclusion.&nbsp; We are not allowed to be free thinking intelligent people, or hold our own opinions on any subject.&nbsp; We are not allowed to dislike football unless we are female, and we are not allowed to breath through our noses with our mouths reserved simply for holding a conversation and chewing our food.  Why are we not allowed to do this?&nbsp; Well as always, I will tell you why.&nbsp; We are prisoners controlled by the fear of not being liked.&nbsp; Too many people give a damn about what other people might think about you if you don’t follow the popular road of life, and dare to have your own ideas.&nbsp; It used to be that new ideas were rallied around and supported, even if they were insane.&nbsp; But now, if you dare not to think that the mouth breather known as ‘Rooney’, is not a walking god in our world who should be worshipped for simply being; but instead think that he is a barely literate thug that would most likely be starting fights outside local night clubs, and spreading his diseased seed through second rate sluts who wear no clothes in winter if he wasn’t playing football with his fellow apes.&nbsp; If you think like that, and dare to speak of it to people you may meet in the world, then you will be accused of not being a proper man, or being a simple headed woman that just doesn’t understand, or in the worst cases, as I have found myself in from time to time, you may find yourselves threatened with physical violence, as is the will of the apes.  So we are ostracized by our beliefs, and as such so many of us pretend to be like other people so that we can be accepted and enjoy life outside our own small groups.&nbsp;  Don’t you think that this is a sad situation.&nbsp; That instead of being free to express ourselves in any way that we see fit, as is our right in the world, we are imprisoned by the beliefs of other people, whose intentions are motivated in a far more sinister way, simply because those views are easier to understand, even if they are wrong.Blogging is one of the answers to this imprisonment.&nbsp; It is a way to let people on the outside know that we are here, being held prisoner against our wills, and that we should call in the UN to rescue us in our oppressed state and allow us to sing once again.&nbsp; Too many people are dying without being heard, and too may people believe that what they think doesn’t matter.&nbsp; Well it does, and it doesn’t matter if you later on discover yourself to be wrong or right.&nbsp; What you think and say does matter, and as a prisoner you should yearn for freedom.&nbsp; Let other prisoners speak out.&nbsp; Let us hear from Nottingham prisons, Lancaster Prisons, Birmingham prisons, Dublin Prisons, Chicago prisons.&nbsp; Remember that in all cases, despite what we are led to believe, the inmates do usually out number the guards, and the guards only have the power if you follow their rules.

      Ask someone a question.  Any question you like, and you would expect an answer.  Ask someone whether or not they agree with the war in Iraq or not and you would expect them to take either the yes view or the no view.  But ask someone a question to hear the remark ‘I don’t know,’ and join me in my frustration.   Ignorance is rife in modern Britain today.  A good percentage of the people under the age of thirty; either don’t know, or don’t care about what is going on in the world.  I have noticed this for some time, and had previously posted it up as stupidity and a lack of intellect, where as ignorance and apathy would be more accurate.  People have stopped caring about their rights to give a damn.  They are allowing themselves to be brainwashed by politically motivated publications and television programmes, and are quickly losing the ability to form their own original thoughts and opinions.  People should know whether or not the war was a good thing or a bad thing because they should have looked at the facts available outside the media (look people - they are all there, just not on UK or US websites) and formed an opinion. Why should they have done this?  Why should everyone have an opinion on events such as this?  I’ll tell you why.  These events are what we will be judged on by the rest of the world.  When people look at Britain they will see the actions we take and judge us on those actions.  Look at how we judge other countries in the same way.  France for instance is always telling their government who holds the power in that country, striking and getting results, and voting out those people who hurt them in any way; and as a result I am always hearing people on radio phone ins complaining that we are not more like that.  America is seen as stupid, ignorant and fat because they don’t seem to realise that there is a world outside their own country.  Germany is seen as regimented and perfectionist because it prides itself on getting things right, and its people are seen as extremely hard working and reliable.  Japan is seen as the fastest advancing country in the world because its people are free to think up new ideas and are taken seriously by their governments. How do you think we are seen in the world do you think?  I think during the protests against the war across the country we were admired for our spirit.  During the golden jubilee we were admired for our patriotism.  But most of the time we are seen as a bunch of football loving thugs who cause trouble, and are unable to think for ourselves preferring instead to follow America wherever they wan to lead us.  Ask yourselves people.  Would you rather be seen as a free thinking advanced nation that wont be dictated to by its government because we are capable for thinking for ourselves on anything that might come up.  Or would you like to compound the dreadful reputation we already have.  Remember, without us the government has no power, and if we let them know that from time to time, it wont do any harm at all.  So look at whats going on around you; talk to anyone that will hold an intelligent conversation, form opinions, and stick with them.  Remember, if its your opinion it cannot be wrong, because its precisely that.  An opinion.

      I don’t get it.  I don’t understand why any normal, or even slightly disturbed human being would take a hunk of metal, vaguely shaped like a car, worth slightly less than the price of a pack of fag papers, and would then proceed to spend thousands of pounds putting speakers the size of Japan in the boot, a stereo with more technology attached to it than the last NASA space mission in the cockpit, and lowering to the level that the slightest bump in the road would rupture even the strongest spine. The only benefit I can think of for doing something this mind numbingly stupid is the fuel economy you can enjoy.  With the bass coming out of the speakers in the back produced by the brain cell killing, eardrum bursting, four/four beats of unoriginal shit on the CD player, the car could simply bounce along the road with no need for an engine at all. I just don’t get it.

      Normality frightens me because I don’t know what it is.  At what point of trying to be cool do you turn into a complete Arse?  and   Are we breeding for the sake of it?  Or are we just sentencing our own children to an inevitable death?

      I have struggled my entire life with my weight, and only really started caring when I had to rest after getting out of bed in the morning.  I was in the extreme, a bloater, and there is no way of getting away from that.  Thankfully this is no longer the case.  However, it is still my firm opinion that Weight loss diets are an almost pure product of capitalised industry over producing sugary, salty generally deep fried in some way crap! You see they all have to compete to gain sales from their competitors, and to increase the products markets.  Living in a capitalised country, and choosing to stay here, I have nothing in principle against this trend as it part of the culture we choose.   Some people have golden fat guys or wicker baskets, and we have money and ad food.  Its just a culture thing. What I have a major issue with is the methods used to achieve these capitalised goals, you see to do this they use chemicals and other substances that actually, and purposefully make the products addictive.  One of the prime examples of this is the tooth dissolving, high calorie, fat inducing sugar water that is Coke. It is a well known fact that the original recipe for coke, or Coca Cola as it is properly known, was originally designed using Cocaine as oen of its ingredients.  When this was made illegal thoughout the civilised world it turned out to not be a bad think for the corporation.  They were able to replace cocaine with something far more addictive.  Caffiene was the new drug of choice for the junk food and drink producers.  If you want proof, why do you think Caffiene free coke and pepsi, the bastard cousin of the coke industry, amount for such a small percentage of their sales.  Also look at the newest drinks on the market.  Red Bull, V, and other caffeine rich things.  The next step is already on its way.  The drinks manufacturers have discovered that a herb called Guarana actually contains 24 times the amount of caffeine naturally found in even full strength coffee.  It is already appearing in many of the alcopops, and other soft drinks made available to children! But don’t get me wrong.  I am not limiting my mild tyrade to Coke and Pepsi.  In fact apart from them most of the other popular junk foods and drinks in the world are purposefully made to be addictive using a far more subtle group of chemicals, sometimes in their natural form, and far more worryingly, sometimes not.  Not only do the least reputable users of these products also have an appalling human rights record, forcing the growers in places like south Africa and Brazil to live in unimaginable poverty (believe me, I have been there and almost weeped in shame for allowing this to happen.) but they actually argue that the item they make are in some way healthy by putting a bit of meagre nutrient drained salad in the middle.  I am of course talking about the new white powders of the modern age.  Sugar and salt.  It is actually possible now to consume an entire weeks worth of salt in just one meal.  How can this possibly be healthy.  Simple answer for the stupid amongst the population.  It cant!  Too much sugar can cause amongst other things Diabetes, Obese weights, Cancer, Irritable bowel disease, skin conditions and tooth decay.  Salt can and does cause on a regular basis Heart disease, water retention, cancer, liver failure, kidney disease, skin conditions and an imbalance in the brain chemicals.  Please note that this is not by a  long way an exclusive list.  The companies know this, but have still increased the levels of both of them in the food they serve to us over the last 30 years for one reason, and one reason only.  They are addictive.  They can be so addictive in fact that they make taking up smoking as a far better, and healthier alternative. So next time you are shopping as I do with you each week, fortnight, or month depending on what suits you best.  Remember who you are supporting, and consider supporting those that don’t kill the people that consume the products they supply, and don’t kill the people that work themselves to death growing them for us.

      Do you watch television?  Have you ever watched television for no other reason than it was in the room?  Do you get home from work, sit down and immediately turn on the television?  Do you read any of the red top newspapers and find them in any way informative?  Do you wake up in the morning and immediately turn on the television.  Do you believe everything you see in the news simply because its on ‘The News’. If the answer to any of these questions mentioned above is yes, then you are no longer in control of your own thoughts.   I can hear you all now saying ‘oh here we go, another ranting extremist suffering from paranoia, lets not listen.’ That statement proves that I am right.  You think that I am extreme because you are spoon-fed the idea that to think anything but what is considered the normal line is in some way radical, and because of that probably wrong.  Good people like Bill Hicks, Michael Moore and others of their ilk have been mocked and pigeon holed by the mainstream press, and broadcast widely by the government spokespeople, as angry nuts.  And of course none of you will ever question that opinion because your friends might not respect you anymore, like they ever really did.  The fact is, they are not in any way crazy, or radical; they are simply thinking and speaking the way we all would be, if we hadn’t submitted to the brainwashing put upon us by the sources of media at our disposal.  When I listen to Michael Moore speak, I do not agree with everything he says, and sometimes completely disagree with the stance he takes on certain issues, but I do listen to the facts he quotes, and heartily agree with the way in which he says it.  He provokes thought, and makes us ask ourselves, and our governments questions, which needs to be done.  Unfortunately, most television is designed to act as a sedative, simply to keep you sat there.  You can’t really blame the television companies for making people spend more time watching their product, but you can blame ourselves for not being strong enough to make the decision to turn it off and read a book, or god forbid, have a conversation.   I am lucky in the fact that I live with a couple of people who have strong views on many subjects, and even luckier that I disagree with them on some.  You see without these differences we cannot inspire debate, and without personal debate we leave ourselves open to the easy option of accepting the view of the news programme we watch, or newspaper we read, followed by a second rate soap opera designed to make us think that our lives are uneventful, and fill us with apathy, therefore making us easily pliable by whoever wants to mould us.   So what’s the moral of this story?  Don’t believe everything you hear, ask questions if you think something might have another side to it, and if you don’t think there are two sides at least to every story, throw your television out of the nearest window, burn the newspapers, and have a conversation with somebody that doesn’t involve talking about television or sport.  It might not be easy, but if you can manage it, I guarantee your life will be better.  It’s time to wake up from the fog.

      Is it me?  This is the cry I hear time and time again as sensible minded people try to make sense of the modern blame and fear culture we seem to live in today.  They hear about the people that go to prison for protecting their property, and the hundreds of thousands of un-earned pounds that seem to fill the pockets of people that do nothing more than wear a pair of shoes a couple of sizes too small for them because the uniform department at their work have run out of the right fit resulting in a couple of mildly painful blisters.  They look at the people around them dumbfounded and utter the battle cry for common sense ‘Is it me?’ Well in answer to that cry for normality to return for society I say that yes, it is you, because you let it happen, and that is almost as bad as doing it in the first place.  I agree wholeheartedly that it is wrong for people who have lost the ability to walk through the negligence of an unscrupulous businessperson too cheap to pay for the correct safety equipment not to receive some kind of compensation, but we must not forget that it was they who decided to get on the ride/ vehicle/boat in the first place, and it was their decision t pay the money for the privilege.  I mean for instance; I like to do dangerous things.  In fact I have been brought up to respect the motto that if you can’t die, its not fun.  But I also have enough common sense in my head to realise that if I get hurt doing these things, then it is no-ones fault but my own.  Let us be honest though.  Its not just the lack of self responsibility that causes our frustration. It’s the imbalance of it all.  People who are hurt through the criminal actions of others, and cannot be held to blame in any way for the injuries they receive get little, or no compensation.  In fact, I believe that the standard rate received for the loss of both parents through a murder, or a Childs loss of mental capability through assault is currently running at around six thousand pounds; where as the current average for being chatted up at work by someone you don’t fancy is around twenty five thousand pounds.  The west, when seen in this state cannot possibly be respected as the enlightened wonder of the world we like to think we are.  In fact, all it does show up is our greed and lack of sympathy all wrapped up in one convenient little package.  My solution is this.  All the people that get hurt through slipping on something, or tripping up, or bumping into something low, or getting hurt whilst driving a very fast petrol powered go cart around a track should receive nothing at all.  In fact, because they were stupid enough not to be looking where they were going, what they should be, is forced to pay for their own treatment privately rather than bleeding the already overstretched NHS.  And the money we would save from this should be pooled, and then distributed as and when needed amongst the victims of crime to make some kind of retribution for not being able to protect them in the first place.  That would surely be something for the rest of the world to look upon and admire.

      They sit in their offices, and their boardrooms talking to their colleagues about how they will do this, and how they will do that, and when they can push the other thing through in time for the next election.  They take bribes, give out favours to friends and acquaintances, have sex with whoever they please because the power they have is so easily abused; and then after all that they send our friends and families to die. Although I am a UK citizen I am supporting Kerry in the US election for one reason alone, and that is the fact that he has been to war, felt the fear, and seen his friends die in the terrible way that is so common when we do these things.  He has fulfilled the one requisite that I think should be mandatory for anyone controlling a part of the worlds forces, and that is taken an understanding of what we are sending our fellow human beings to endure.  And that is the subject of this posting.  Should we allow people to make decisions about things they don’t have a full understanding of?  I have no doubt that they understand all the issues involved; be it oil, or money, or regime change, or whatever other excuse they feel the need to create in order to give their rich mates just a little bit more money.  But do they actually understand what they are asking the men and women they send in to do.  Do they understand the feelings they will have to endure to achieve what they are asking.  Do they understand the pain many of them will have to go through, the blood they will have to spill, and the friends they will have to watch die just to get what they want done.  The simple answer to that is no.  Tony Blair has never served in the armed forces.  Bush Jr. was a deserter, joining the forces through national service, but deciding that he would leave one day for a walk, returning two years later just in time to drop out.  In fact out of all the world leaders, less than 20% of them have ever served in the armed forces, yet they control all of them.  How can that be right?  Our generals and field marshals spend years of training and spill blood sweat and tears in action before they are even allowed to consider controlling even a small portion of these forces, yet somebody who has never even been near a tank, except for a pointless photo opportunity for ‘please vote for us monthly’, and has no first hand understanding of what a soldiers life is about is put in control of all of them.  I am convinced that it is this ignorance that leads us to go to war so easily nowadays.  Don’t worry though; I have a solution that I am convinced utterly would lead us much further down the road of world peace.  We should make an international decree that any person, ever wanting to serve in the capacity of leader of a country, large or small, should first commit them selves to a minimum of two years public service in one of the armed service, and will only be allowed to leave once they have seen action and conducted themselves in an exemplary manner, signed off by their senior officers.  As soldiers service records are a matter for public record, it should be fairly easy to verify this.  I think that once they have experienced watching the bodies of the people they just had breakfast with, swinging headless from a street light by a rope attached to one bloody stump where the foot used to be, the fat still bubbling under the charred skin where they had been set alight, screaming before they died; they would be less likely to send others to meet the same fate.  Maybe they would have shared a joke with them over the cornflakes, about how hot it was in this damn country, but one thing they would definitely have shared is the gut churning fear that would never leave you.  Soldiers are not fearless, they just work hard to control the fear they feel, but they feel it just the same; and it would serve us never to forget that.  If our leaders had felt that fear, and lived through it, I would be more ready to accept them sending our troops in to a combat situation, because I would know that they would not do it lightly.  Now though, they simply do.

      Have you ever been relaxing in front of the telly, or sitting down engrossed in some work, or a good book; only to be awoken from your blissful state of concentration by the doorbell screaming in your ears; which then turns out o be a religious group, a charity organisation begging for money, or a survey team asking for you to spend half an hour of your time answering the same questions in thirty two different and each less interesting ways. Have you then stood there in the open doorway not really listening to what they are using as the opening gambit; instead trying to think of a cruel and unusual way of telling them to go and boil their heads. Living in Watford, a multi cultural (supposedly), Multi faith, ultimately very dull community; I am faced with this situation rather a lot.  I used to pride myself on the brilliant put downs I would create to make them sob quietly to themselves as they left my doorway, and share the experiences with my friends later that evening.  That was until I realised that I was going against the principles I hold very close to my heart.  Those of free speech, and increased debate and opinion.  I realised that if there is no-one to listen, then free speech was pointless, and by not listening to these people; however deranged they appeared to be, I was not allowing them the same rights I expected for myself.  So I started letting them in, which wasn’t only the right thing to do, but also far more fun.  I was given the opportunity to sit down with the religious zealots and listen to what they thought their religion represented; and then using the fact that I have studied religion to point out the flaws in their argument, and getting them to think about what it was they had just said in the context of the available facts.  This is of course the nature of debate, and is vital to the evolution of our society.  Without debate, the right decisions can never be made, and if we are incapable of making our own decisions, then somebody else will make them for us; which means that we are no longer free individuals, rather than a large mass of flesh following the path set before us with no ability to think at all.  We may as well be pond scum if that is allowed to happen.  For those of you saying, ‘ok, that makes a bit of sense.  Speak to the politicians, and speak to the religions when they come to the door, so that we can benefit from each others views, but what about the surveys.  That’s just a waste of my life.  I could be breathing, or masturbating in that time, which surely would be a better use of it.’ Well, you’re not entirely wrong in that opinion.  But I would ask you to consider this.  If we live in a commercial, capitalist world, and the people who run the companies at the top of this world make their decisions based on the results of public opinion surveys; which they do; then surely taking part in a survey is pretty close to voting on the thinks that may have an effect on your life.  So the new flavour of coke may not change your life completely; but it is still part of your life, no matter how small, and isn’t it nice to be able to have a say in even that bit. So next time somebody comes to your door asking for a few minutes of your time, don’t dismiss them so quickly.  Would you rather be telling your friends about how you told them to put their fists up the backsides of two armadillos and shout mush, or would you rather tell them that you spoke to these people and you had made them go away and think about what they were saying, so that they wouldn’t waste time on stupid arguments again, but would instead in the future make positive inputs into society.

      Simple question.  In our quest to be truly unique individuals, are we just kidding ourselves?  Is it not really the case that every thought and action we have is merely a result of watching and copying everyone else in the world.  Even the most unique amongst us is merely a mish mash of a dozen other people.  I have watched people throughout my life and have been amazed at how easy it is to categorise them.  They are either Goths, townies, punks, suits, snobs, middle class, working class, chavs, ponces, bastards, or any other of a thousand different descriptions provided for us to place people within.  As a result of these little slots, we feel almost compelled, be it consciously, or sub-consciously to throw ourselves into one.  So if there is no way to be a true individual in the literal sense of the word; is there really such a thing as independent thought, or unique and original ideas.  I write stories which I am convinced are my own ideas, and come from someplace magical hidden deep within my brain.  But the truth is, if I spend enough time thinking about it, I can pinpoint where the seed of the idea started, and am always left wondering whether it was my idea at all, or simply the bastardisation of someone elses.  Maybe the fact is, its not the ideas and thoughts themselves that are original, but rather how we interpret them that counts.  I like to believe that this is the case, and I hope that this means that the opinion we all should have is valid; because although it might not be entirely our own, the way in which it is placed back into the mix of the world, is entirely ours.

      I was wrong.  I am not going to live forever.  Dying is not something that happens to other people when they are old, but is going to happen to me too.  I look at my mother who is sobbing quietly on a chair whilst a nurse comforts her.  Doctor Brian sat on the edge of my bed and held my hand whilst he told me about the cancer in my bones, and about how it cant be stopped now; that it had gone too far now and couldn’t be stopped.  The operation had shown that the chemotherapy I had gone through over the past three months had not worked, and I was going to die. He asked me if I wanted the prognosis, meaning did I want to know how long I was going to live.  I couldn’t think of anything more dreadful, so I told him no.  My mother had come to the other side of my bed and was telling me how sorry she was.  I don’t know why she was saying that because it wasn’t her fault.  Its just one of those things that’s all, and I was wrong. He’s nice doctor Brian.  He was the doctor my GP referred me too when I first got ill, and he has been really good at talking to me, and stuff.  His real name isn’t doctor Brian.  Its doctor Talisk, but he said I could call him Brian like he was a friend or something.  I think he is a bit of a friend because he’s always really nice to me, and he always tries to keep my mum happy.  The doctor and the nurse have gone out of the room now, and my mum is outside calling my dad and my brother and sister.  I wonder how they will be when they find out.  I hope they won’t be too sad, because that will make me sad too.  I wonder what I can do to make things all right for them when I die, so that they won’t cry too much.  The councillor is coming to speak to me soon.  I hope my mum doesn’t have to sit in because I want to ask them some private stuff that I might not be able to if she is there.  I guess I’ll know soon.  Doctor Brian said that he would ‘stop by later’ as he put it, to see how I was.    My mum has come back to tell me that my family will be coming in later, and I am not looking forward to it.  Is that selfish?  I hope not.  I just don’t want to see them upset.  I prefer it when they are happy.  I hope they’re not going to stand around looking glum and telling me how sorry they are.  If I am going to die soon, the last thing I want to do is spend my time being miserable.  I want to go bungee jumping, or white water rafting and stuff like that.  I reckon that I have to get a whole lifetime into a couple of years, or how ever long I’ve got left.  The councillor will be in first though, so I can ask them how to deal with it.  Its really weird me thinking like this you know.  I’m not usually the sensible one in our family.  My dad will tell you that after he’s hoarse from shouting at me when I’ve done something wrong.  I think I’m going to miss that you know.  Yeah, I realise how weird that seems, but I always knew I was alive and thinking for myself when he was shouting at me, and I could do with that right now.  The councillor was nice.  She was a big black lady, and kind of jolly looking.  She spoke really posh though.  I asked her about what I should do about my family, and she said that I should tell them how I feel.  That I could get away with saying anything I wanted to them now, and that I shouldn’t ruin my chance now because I might not get another one later.  She was really smart.  I have decided to tell my family not to treat me like I’m some kind of disabled person, but that they should instead help me to live every day I’ve got to the maximum.  She said I could call her anytime I wanted.  Doctor Brian came in when she was about to leave and made a joke about not giving her too much of a hard time.  Isn’t it strange how that kind of joke is only funny when you’re in hospital.  If they had said it outside I would have thought they were embarrassing.    I’m getting ready to go to sleep now.  My family were great, and had spoken to the councillor before they came in.  She told them that I would be annoyed if they came in all upset, so they came in talking about what they were going to do for my birthday in a couple of weeks time.  She was really cool that councillor.  Wendy her name was.  I think it might be ok in the end you know.  I’ve been thinking a lot about not being immortal any more.  I think that if I write everything down, and make scrapbooks and things like that for my family to remember the happy time with me.  I think that that way I can still stay alive in a way.  It’s a shame really that I’m not going to be around soon.  But I’m going to have a really good birthday just in case its my last, and I don’t think I will ever die completely.  Not as long as I keep making enough noise for everyone to remember me by.  I wonder If I’ll get old enough to learn how to drive?

       16th May 2152   Today at the supreme court, cryogenic revival Walt Disney was standing trial for offences under the sex offences acts of 2132.  Mr Disney, 74, has pleaded Not Guilty to the charge of promoting innocence, a crime punishable by up to twenty years in prison.  In shocking evidence today, the jury was shown footage of the types of film Mr Disney was trying to promote, which featured sickening scenes of non violences, and moralistic teachings. It is well known in our modern society that the production of this type of material greatly exaserbates what were formerly seen as crimes.  The legal reforms were put in place after professer Ferraris twelve year research paper was publish in 2132 showing that it was the outrage of crime that made it so abhorrent, and if the motivation for the outrage was removed then the crime was no longer harmful, and there fore should no longer be considered a crime.  This is why the removal of all materials promoting the idea of crime as a criminal act, and all those materials that could entice people into commiting certain sex acts through the idea of innocence was enforced.  Since this time the public opinion of the previously lax justice system has improved by almost 600%. Mr Disney, on release from cryogenics facilities in Florida, was reportedly disgusted by the wholesome programmes being produced by his former company, such as the no.1 rated show Anthrax Kat and the Sex Puppets.  He then allegedly used his 51% share in the Disney corporation to attempt to promote censored and illegal material such as the notorious Bambi, which promotes the protection of animals, and thought to be one of the main causes of violent activist activity in the twentieth century.   After several shows produced by Mr Disney made it onto public viewing on the network owned by his company, he was immediately arrested by public order enforcers, who described the material confiscated as evidence as ‘harrowing and wrong.’ Chief inspector Warner when questioned about the case against Mr Disney stated, ‘In all my years enforcing public protection from the causes of crime, I have never seen a case so sickeningly blazen.  Mr Disney will have to answer to his peers, and I expect him to spend a long time removed from potential harm in the public domain.’   In Court  As the charges were read out to the defendant on day one of this trial, he looked visably shaken and shocked, using the table as a support as he seemed to rock on his feet.  He was dressed in a black suit, and in keeping with his outlaw image, wore white gloves.  The council for  the defence, Mr Y Sam  spoke for the first time yesterday outside the court about the situation involving his client saying. ‘It is my duty to defend Mr Disney  to the best of my ability, and I intend to do that, although the case against him does look compelling, I am sure that the court will recognise that my client could see no wrong in what he was doing, and will therefore recommend rehabilitation rather than incarceration as the result in this case.’ In a rebuttal interview, the prosecuting council Ms. L Toones, said ‘There is no proof that Mr Disney is in any way phsycologically impaired, and as a result of this, we will be pushing for the maximum sentence for this offence.’ The trial is expected to continue over for another two days, with the jury expected to take not longer than a further half day to reach a verdict.

      ‘He’s not being eaten by the tiger, rather he is clinging to his tiger spirit for protection.’ The tour guide was explaining to the young children as they looked with boredom at an emerald vessel that seemed to depict a man looking forlorn out of a tigers’ mouth.  She was a pretty young woman with a slim figure, which was hugged by her blue museum uniform, and crowned with golden hair, which was tied in a long ponytail at the back.  Her dreary days were spent trying to explain to the endless line of idiot children the importance of ancient art, and its relationship to the spiritual belief of the people that lived, and in certain parts of the world still do live, all over the world.  She often wondered why she had taken this job.  Apart from her love of the spirits, and all things spiritual, she couldn’t think of a good reason.  She hated kids, and all the things that seemed to come with them.  Things like teachers, and packed lunches that spew dirt and rubbish all over the place.  Then she would find herself in the museum alone at night, apart from the occasional security guard that would let her indulge in her fascination of the exhibits. Her favourite pieces were the heads that were created by tribes throughout the centuries.  They went from crude stone heads created in 1300BC by West African tribes, through to the beautifully ornate and finely crafted pieces, still being created today in several cultures.  Then there were her special pieces, the shrunken heads retrieved from the hidden tribes in South America, where cannibalism was rife until just a few years ago.  When she looked at them she could almost feel the spirits they were supposed to contain, the features on their faces remarkably preserved by the shaman from these tribes using special juices and extracts from the plants found growing naturally around the tribal sites.  It was a common belief across the continents, she had found through her research on these pieces, that the human spirit, and any guide spirit attributed to that person, lived in the head, and that by creating either a replica vessel, or by preserving the head, you could harness the power of these spirits to protect you and your family from harm, or you could inflict harm upon your enemies.  This night she needed her spirit heads to help calm her after a day of the most obnoxious children she had ever come across, until that is until she met the next group tomorrow. She gazed at a mask produced by the Aborigines hundreds of years earlier, a scrappy feather still clinging to the bone beak attached to the front.  The spirit of a bird was held within this mask, and she longed to feel the freedom this must give.  She could almost picture herself gliding through the hot skies of Australia watching for small voles, or insects below hidden amongst the red clay and coarse brush.  She would see the tribal people painted in the white paint and red ochre dancing around the mask of power for her strength and life through the ages.  She would feel the infusion of power and strike forward with renewed vigour, safe in the knowledge that her spirit would be eternal as long as the mask existed.  This was the power of the spirit art, and it always caught her imagination like nothing else could.  This was why she worked here.  Her love for the history would always overcome her despising of the visitors to the building.  In the echoing loneliness that only comes from an empty museum she ran her fingers over the smooth wood of a North American ritual mask, tracing along the sides of the bloated lips and grooved cheeks, shining in the shadows of the low lighting left on when the museum closed; a final farewell to her friends as she left the building to walk home.  Stuart, the security guard threw up a brief wave as he locked the door behind her, and she walked down the stone steps to the street below.  The night glowed orange from the street lighting above, and she paused to feel their glow before starting out in the chilly evening air.  The clear skies spoke of a frost to come, and her breath cut white clouds into the path in front of her as she walked.  She didn’t mind the walk home.  It was just a little short of a mile to her small terraced house, and she found the walk quite useful for clearing her head of the days rubbish, and it was usually uneventful.  Tonight was going to be a little different though.   She first noticed the man following her as she took the shortcut through an alleyway through to Smith Street.  Amongst the sounds of rats scurrying amongst the old tin dustbins that were left out for the bin men the next day, and the televisions blaring through blue flickering light in the windows high above, she heard a shoe scuff on the ground.  She turned quickly, her heart stopping momentarily and saw a shadow flit backwards fifty feet behind her.  She took a breath as her mind helped her dismiss it as nothing, and tentatively turned back towards her journey.  It wasn’t long before she heard another sound though.  This time it was a small pebble travelling along the cobbled alleyway, like it had been kicked accidentally.  She turned again, this time not stopping, her heart beat increased, and so did her pace, almost causing her to trip as she craned her neck to see her apparent pursuer.  The shadow didn’t move this time though, but a shape was there, and it was enough to make her pulse take on a new beat as she turned forward again.  She reached to end of the alleyway to be bathed in the comforting orange glow once again.  Turning left she walked at a pace down Smith Street without turning to look back again, nervous at what she might see.  She imagined the stone head again, wishing she could take on the strength of the spirit within it tonight.  She felt the presence of her pursuer, imagining the breath, a rasping sound causing the white clouds that would reach with tendrils to grasp her.  She felt herself slowing down as her imagination tried to take control.  A turn down Morrison way and Smith Street was behind her.  Her pace still brisk, though not a jog.  She was too afraid of bringing the incident to a premature end.  She could hear the footfalls behind her now.  He didn’t seem to care about hiding his presence anymore.  She took the final turn into Black Avenue where her small terraced house was placed just one hundred metres away.  Her body slowed, her blood feeling like it was thickening with treacle in her veins.  The footsteps came audibly closer, the rasping breath brushing the hairs on the back of her neck, although he couldn’t have been that close, as when she turned to her door and placed the key, shaking up to the lock, he didn’t grab her.  She rushed into the reluctant doorway and moved quickly down into the hallway, carelessly throwing the door closed behind her, a dull thump as a foot was placed in the way.  She rushed in response to the doorway directly ahead of her and slammed it behind her. The man that had been following her followed slowly, feeling that the moment he had been waiting for had finally arrived.  He opened the door and looked ahead, stopping stunned as he stared face to face with a row of shrivelled heads on a shelf before him.  The smell in this room made him gag, and he lurched slightly as the long sharp blade cut into his neck, paralysing him instantly so he was unable to feel the warm flow down his back.  The world to him turned black.   A dim light started to fill his world again, slowly at first.  He could hear some chanting, a light sweet singular voice, but it was still too foggy for him to make anything out.  Blackness claimed him again.  He woke once more, many voices around him.  He had no concept of how much time had passed, the voices giving him no clue as to where he was.  He waited for his vision to clear.  He felt strange, his body not reacting to any messages sent by his brain, and his thirst raged.  The world before him started to become clearer.  He thought he could make out the woman he had followed in her blue uniform, and she seemed to be surrounded by smaller people, or children.  He tried to blink, but couldn’t. ‘And here is something very interesting class.  The sages that made these heads believed that by preserving them, they kept the spirit inside them alive to help protect future generations.  No don’t touch please, they are very delicate.’

      A thousand words about a bicycle, a headmaster, and a hotel?  Faye was convinced that her own headmaster had gone completely insane setting this homework.  I mean how could he expect her to produce a thousand words on anything, without putting these stupid rules in place as well.   ‘Quite frankly’, Faye thought ‘I think the best thing to do is shove a bicycle right up the headmasters backside in a hotel room, and then just write down the expletives that came out of his mouth.  She was sure that that would reach a thousand words easily.   ‘Stuff it!’ Faye had always had a problem with talking to herself ‘I’m not doing it.  I’ll just bunk off and he can whistle for his stupid homework!’ The wind felt good on her face as she sped through the large park just ½ a mile from her school.  It seemed to reinforce the freedom she felt making her own decisions and not following the rules set down by an oppressive society.  Then there was a sudden jarring, and a somehow deafening sound of ripping as her bike came to a fast and unexpected halt when her jeans got caught in the chain.  She tried to stop herself with her other foot on the floor, but as the bike was just a couple of inches too tall for her, this action caused her to lose balance completely, which resulted in a nasty graze up her arm, causing more clothing damage on her previously light blue shirt sleeve, which was now taking on a rather fetching scarlet hue. ‘Oh, bloody hell, my mum’s going to kill me.’ The master of her oppressive society reared her ugly head in Fayes mind.  Disapproving looks already installed in full.   As an after thought, Faye finally realised that the gravel that had set up camp in the bloody mess that had become her arm, actually hurt, and that she should really try and do something about it.  But she was breaking the rules. She was skiving off school and would get absolutely murdered if she got caught.  Her mother would beat Faye to within an inch of her life.  She had of course promised to do this a couple of dozen times over the last year alone; but this time she might actually do it, and Faye didn’t want to take the risk.   The first action was to stop lying in the middle of a path, in an abandoned park, and disentangle her-self from the guts of the bicycle that had decided to punish her for reasons she could not comprehend.  After much jowl ironing face pulling, as further rips were heard during the bike, clothing, skin, separation operation, she hobbled her way towards the road running alongside the park, where she would pray for inspiration on finding a solution to her entirely undeserved predicament. Inspiration however, came sooner than she could have hoped.  A building set amongst the trees to his left caught her eye, and she remembered that the park was in reality, a golf course belonging to a large five star hotel, which was the building she could now see.  Faye now realised why the men she had screamed past earlier had taught her some new words, at an extremely rude volume.  The solution to her problem was there though.  She would go to the hotel, claim that he was the daughter of one of the golfers, and that she had fallen over whilst following her father around the course.  They would then patch her up, and wouldn’t contact her parents because they were already there.  She might even get some free chocolate out of it if she sold it well enough.    The hotel staff reacted almost exactly as Faye had hoped they would, fawning over her, and, although she didn’t get any chocolate, she did get some ice cream, and that was almost as good.  The only difference to the plan in her head was when the hotel manager asked her fathers name.  She had thought quickly and given the name that was haunting her mind most determinedly at that moment.   Mr Murphy was the name of Fayes headmaster, and despite her imaginations best attempts to convince her that she felt free, and didn’t care about what she would do if she was caught skiving.  His face still popped up every five seconds to make her heart jump.  Then unexpectedly she started hearing his voice in her head.  And her mums voice as well.   ‘Oh no!’  This wasn’t her imagination.  They were there, in the entrance hall in the hotel.  They must have used her mums mind power to find her.  Faye carried on talking to herself in angry whispers, before realising that angry whispers were probably more conspicuous than actually talking, but not as conspicuous as a girl in a wrecked and bloody half school uniform sitting in a five star hotel, talking to herself. She got up; her heart beating faster than she could have thought possible, and making a sound so loud she couldn’t believe the entire congregation of Japanese people unloading themselves from a coach outside weren’t looking directly at her with astonished looks on their faces.   Fayes head teacher and mother turned towards her, looking right at him.  She ducked and retreated as far as she could into the stairwell running up from the lounge area in the hotel.  They were still aiming themselves directly at her.  She took a risk and ran up the first two flights of stairs and hid herself, indiscreetly behind the banisters on the first hallway and looked back down to where they were still advancing.  They climbed the first set of stairs, and paused, before turning to their right and starting up the second set of stairs towards the hallway where Faye was crouching. ‘Oh come on,’ Fayes brain said.’ What is this, some kind of oppressors radar?’ She performed an impressive crouch, run, retreat, manoeuvre, trying doors as she went, until about five doors down, one opened, and she almost fell inside.  She thought he could hear the footsteps tracking her scent down the hallway, so quickly looked for a place to hide.  The wardrobe had long been the school-kids refuge, according to the comics Faye read regularly, so that is where she went, using her small fingers to slide the door shut behind her.  Then, almost unbelievably she heard the door opening again, and her mother and the headmaster came into the room, talking too softly for her to make out what they were saying.  Fayes bowels started to loosen considerably. The door was closed, and strange noises drifted to her ears.  Rustling of clothing, Mmmms, Ahhhs, and Ohhhhs met her ears and left a state of shock in her mind.  They were doing it!  Aaaggghhh!  How disgusting! Faye stayed stock still in her refuge though.  Allowing the hideous life scars to form uncompromisingly on her memories.  This would make a good homework though, she thought.

      The light sparkled on the water forming tiny diamonds playing in the air as she leapt from the sea in tandem with her sleek bodied sisters.  Squeals and cackles of delight filed the air as their excitement grew with each time they broke the waters surface. The boats on the surface, white and brilliant, were full of people straining to get a glance of her, so she turned and glided along side them for a while, giving them what they wanted, the coolness of the water ensuring she never tired. A whale came up nearby, breaching the water with a mighty crash, the shockwaves pushing the dolphins slightly off course.  The warty knuckles on the whales back, despite their normally grotesque appearance, shone beautifully in the intense sunlight. Like when humans swim in a tropical paradise, our dolphin found her nirvana here; the sun warming her back, and the water, cooling her belly. Food! A ball of silver glinted in the water to the left of her as she dived. Thousands of tiny fish swam themselves into a bubbling fury as they sensed the presence of the dolphins.  She signaled its appearance to her companions with a squeal and a whip of her tail as she accelerated towards them at a desperate speed.  The fish had formed a tight sphere and were swimming in a furious formation trying to protect them-selves from the incoming missiles.  Their tactic however did not work with our dolphin. She streaked toward the center of the ball, speeding up all the time and bombarding them with her sonar screams before scattering them into disarray.  The small battered fish, confused, quickly tried to rally and move to rebuild the silver sphere, but just as quickly the other dolphins followed their companion in the hunt and struck the broken chunks of the school with equal ferocity, leaving hundreds of them isolated only to be picked off as succulent fresh food by the dolphin and her friends. With the first bite of the fresh kill the taste was unimaginable, with the oily juices, and rich dark fluids mixing in the salty brine before sliding down her throat; followed swiftly by the sweet textured meat.   Then the frenzy of the hunt was over almost as quickly as it had begun, as the dominant sharks that followed the killing grounds came to claim the carrion produced by the uneaten remains, and those fish stunned and floating on the surface above, their bellies exposed to the hot tropical sun. The dolphin swam to the surface where more boats were gathering to watch these, the stars of the ocean.  She gave a snort from her blow-hole and uttered a shrill laugh of triumph at the day as her dorsal fin cut the surf. 'Sshh.' She dived back down to her companions and shrieked at them to join her. 'Shut up, you'll have them in here if your not careful.' Another shrill laugh to please her spectators, this time accompanied by an almost impossible jump, then a deep dive, crashing through the surface in an explosion of spray and seaweed. Then disaster, she’s trapped!  It must be a net!  She thrashes around trying to gain her freedom before she drowns, but to no avail.  She only succeeded in making her binds tighter! 'Wake up!' A noise, muffled by the water, but sounding like a human voice, it must be the fisherman trying to save her! 'Wake up!  Come on now.' The orderlies finally managed to shake their ward awake, her bleary eyes struggling against the bright lights in the white room. 'Every night its the same thing.  She starts thrashing around, making the strangest noises, disturbing the other patients, and look.  Oh no.  She's wet the bed again.  That’s the fourth time this week alone.' The doctor in charge of the ward looked on with pity as the nurses tried to calm and comfort the distressed patient.    (Please let me know if I should continue this one.)

      Two people sat opposite each other.  One was looking intensely at the other, who in turn, could not bring him-self to face the girl directly.  A tear followed time- ravaged contours, made deeper through hardship set into the aged mans face. ‘I didn’t know you would be so beautiful’  A small tentative glance through his dirty hair at her face, then quickly he looked away again. ‘Where have you been?’ As she said this her hand wandered protectively to lightly brush his left ear. ‘Please, tell me where you have been.’ He inhaled slowly and deeply, and then breathed out as if trying to cleanse his body and soul of the fear that gripped it since he had first heard her voice ten minutes ago.  His body started to shake as if slightly cold.  His head turned angling to one side. ‘Its been too long already; just tell me what happened to you, why did you disappear, why didn’t you let me know you were alive, why did you not want to see me, why did you do this to us, why did you do this to yourself? Her questions suddenly flew forward in a torrent of words, this tsunami crashed into him, each wave causing a little more of his walls to fall away, eroded and tired. ‘You don’t understand.’ ‘Try me.’ He spoke, precisely and clearly, with only a slight waver in his voice declaring the raging emotions coursing through him.   ‘I was, I still am afraid, ashamed, but mostly frightened of what you must think of me.  After what happened, with, well you know, I couldn’t think that you would do anything other than hate me.  And I loved you so much that I could not cope with the idea.’ ‘ So you just decided to disappear, to not tell me you were free.  To just leave me alone to worry about you, and not know whether my own father was dead’ Her voice was portraying anger, but her eyes were filled with water, showing her true feelings inside.  He tried not to look. ‘I didn’t see it as leaving.  I was already gone, so I just thought it would be easier if I never came back.’ ‘Easier for who exactly?’ The hint of anger was showing strongly in her voice now, causing the others in the café to turn and see what was going on.  She ignored them. ‘For both of us.  For me.  I just couldn’t face you anymore, knowing what I was now; cant you understand that.’ As he spoke, his eyes looked down upon himself, as if seeing his real appearance for the first time. ‘No!’ The word shouted loudly, without any restraint, caused him to visibly flinch.  He was suddenly conscious of how much he had hurt her, and himself, by staying away.  But what could he have done, the life he had led was criminal at best, and despicable most of the time. He had been quite a talented artist in his time, able to reproduce most different styles developed by the greats, from Constable through to H.R.Gieger.  At first he had tried to sell his own work, quite unsuccessfully, but it had not taken long for the lowest element of the art trade to notice his abilities for reproduction.  He was recruited by a group of people who wanted to pay him serious amounts of money to copy exactly some paintings that were supposedly thought missing in the art world.  He had a dead wife and a young daughter to support, and had only managed to sell two of his paintings in the last month, both for less than two hundred pounds, which made him very susceptible to any offers of money.   He painted the pictures they asked for, and took their money gratefully, only expecting to do three or four at first, just to give him a little financial breathing room.  But of course, when you start on this kind of path, turning back is harder than you would let yourself believe.  He started to feel like Hansel, from the Hansel and Gretil story, when the birds had eaten their trail of breadcrumbs.  He started to forget what he was doing was illegal, and just started to enjoy his new life.  He even earned himself a nickname in the trade, ‘DOJO’, because the pictures he made were so accurate that it was as if he had simply joined the dots. Then the police came.  He had been arrogant, or naïve enough to never expect this to happen, and had been quite blasé about opening the door to the police and inviting them in for a cup of tea.  He had no idea what kind of trouble he was in, and kept himself in denial all the way up to the time when the judge sentenced him to six years in jail, and a total confiscation of assets.  He thought that they would all turn round at any second and tell him that they had just been trying to scare him, and that they would not send him away as long as he promised never to do it again; but of course this never happened. His daughter was sent into care for two years until she reached sixteen, when she was expected to fend for herself, which she did admirably, finding a job as a telephone sales assistant for an insurance company initially, then working her way up to e a branch manager, then an area manager in the space of four years. Ashamed, her father had not allowed her to visit him in jail, and had stopped returning her letters after just six months, encouraging her to make the most of her life, and to do it without him.  She continued to write to him for a further six months, but when she received no replies, she decided to respect his wishes, not wanting him to feel any pain from having to remember her.  On the day he was due for release though, she was there, waiting outside the prison gates, ready to see her father for the first time in six years, her heart beating hard with excitement.  He wasn’t there though.  She waited all day, and only moved on when a prison official came out to ask her what she was doing there.  She was told that he had been released after just serving three years of his six year sentence, and that he had left alone, leaving no forwarding address.  Even his parole officer had lost track of him after twelve months, but did not consider him to be a risk, so had not pursued the matter further. Her mission to find her father had gone of for two years.  Searching art dealerships around the world, faxing and emailing photographs to all those people she could think of that might run across him at any time, but nothing.  Nothing until, that was, she received the following report from a private investigator she had hired to continue the search after her own time had been exhausted. ‘  Your father has found his escape in bottles of cheap alcohol.  I believe him to be the person found standing outside Liverpool street tube station singing his songs at passers by, whilst they look anywhere but at him.  He is a pitiful site, damaged by whatever life seems to have thrown at him.  His only source of income seems to be from begging, and stealing from fellow vagrants as they sleep.  It is my opinion that he is also suffering from poor physical and mental health brought on by the substance abuse of both alcohol and probably inhaled toxics over the period of many months.  He is of no fixed abode.  Please inform me of how you would like me to proceed with this information.’ The report had left her stunned.  She sat down heavily in her office staring at it for almost twenty minutes, unable to read it any more, the letters becoming just blurs on a page.  She grabbed her waste bin and was sick into it until her body was retching itself dry in muscle cramping heaves.  Her colleagues came in to see what was wrong, and she claimed illness and went home immediately, the journey an immediately lost memory.   When she had recovered from the shock of this revelation, she contacted the investigator, and asked him to take her to her father.  He had been hesitant at first, telling her that he might not even remember her, and that it may cause more harm than good to bring the past back to life for them both.  She insisted however, and the investigator picked her up in his car, and drove her the laborious journey into central London.   Each and every traffic light seemed to be red when they approached it, and every box junction blocked by traffic, making every metre seem like a mile, and making her already nervous demeanour harder and harder to cope with.  She tried to shut her mind down, and suppress the boiling vat of emotion welling up inside her, but only succeeded in bringing on terrible visions of what her father must have gone through in order to end up the way he was.  He brain was working against her, and persecuting her with guilt.  She should never have stopped writing to him.  It didn’t matter if he didn’t write back, at least he would have known that somebody cared, and would be waiting for him when he came out.  Why had she not checked up on him?  Why had she not forced the prison to give her a visiting order, even though he had told her that he did not want to see her? The investigator noticed the expressions of torture washing over her features. ‘There is no use blaming yourself for what has happened.  He is what he made of himself, not what you made of him.’ This was supposed to comfort her she knew, but it failed utterly.  The car stopped and they got out.  The investigator pointed towards the entrance of the station, where she immediately began looking for her father.  She could see dozens of people milling around, going about their lives oblivious to each other, there were a couple of Big Issue sellers, but they were too young.  The a flower seller moved to one side, allowing her a glimpse of a ragged pair of brown boots attached to a man slouching on the floor, his back to the grey concrete wall.  The face was almost completely hidden by a large black greasy beard, and darkened by dirt ground in through months of poor hygiene.  He seemed to be wearing far too many items of clothing, as if her had lost his suitcase and had decided to wear everything to keep it from getting lost.  A baseball cap that had once been pale blue, the logo long since worn off, was squashing his hair, overgrown and black.  A large half empty plastic bottle of cheap cider was resting in his lap, being held by calloused hands, one with a finger missing, and the wound becoming septic.  ‘No.’ She had addressed this to the investigator, more in hope than reality.  She knew that this man was her father, but did not want to accept it.  The investigator simply nodded slowly, realising that words would accomplish nothing.  She hung her head for a moment and then seemed to reach a resolve.  She crossed the busy road and reached the space where her father sat at about the same time as a policeman.  The policeman was trying to move him on, asking him patiently to stand up and be on his way.  Her father was clearly too drunk to do as he was told, and simply mumbled and cursed at the officer, who was turning to his radio for assistance. ‘Please.’ She heard her voice as if somebody else was using it. ‘Please, leave him be.’ The officer turned and asked ‘Sorry miss, but he is obstructing the entrance, I have got to move him on.  Health and safety.’ The last three words helping him to justify his actions, and giving him the authority he obviously felt he needed. ‘No you don’t understand.  I know him.  He’s going to come with me.’ ‘Is he now?’  The policeman seemed to disbelieve her.  ‘And what exactly is he to you then miss?’ ‘He’s my father.’ This prompted a reaction from the sad figure slumped on the ground.  A sobering talisman had been waved at him and he lifted his head, a spark of life coming into his eye. ‘Susan?’ His voice sounded as if it had not been used properly in a long time, quiet and strained.  She turned to look down at him, hope returning in anguish. ‘Yes dad, its me.’ The policeman, surprised by this unexpected response, was soon convinced to help her lift him from the ground.  The smell almost unbearable, but she seemed not to notice.  He made sure they were going to be ok, and left them to find their way. So now they sat in the one café that would let them in.  A dingy place that did not instil trust in its ability not to poison its customers.  But warm at least, and quiet so they could talk.  The investigator returned to wait in his car. ‘NO!’  She had said, and he had flinched.   Susan was angry, but so relieved to be with her father again.  She had started to imagine him dead.  Killed by the people that had let him go to prison for making those pictures for them, and left to rot at the bottom of the Thames like so many others over the centuries.  He was here though, in body and mind, and she was happy, and it was coming out as being angry because she was still blaming herself for what had happened. ‘I love you Susan.’ That was all it took, and her anger was gone. ‘Come on dad.  Lets get you to a hospital.’ He released himself entirely into her hands, the roles reversed completely.  The child now looking after the parent. ‘We’ve been through an adventure you and I.  And now it is time for it to end.  Only that way can we start again.’ The two figures disappeared out of the café and formed a striking scene on the high street.  A young pretty woman dressed in a smart suit, her clean well groomed dark hair flowing down her back in a long luxurious ponytail, holding in support a wretched man, older than his years, smelling of stale urine and tart alcohol, and she looked at him with more love than anybody could have thought possible.  Nobody would have guessed that they were related, so different they were in appearance, but not a soul would have been left untouched by the tenderness they gave to each other on that short walk down the street.

      The designer glasses set like an additional set of eyes bolted to the front of his head reflected in the sunlight catching the attention of the light yellow jumper sat next to the inflated hairy pasta eater in the corner.  An unmatched couple for sure, or merely proof that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But surely even with that being the case, ugliness that pronounced must run straight to the bone.  He watched in morbid fascination as the man beast shovelled another bowl full of greasy spaghetti into his filthy mouth, which even as large as it was, didn’t seem to be able to accommodate what it was being asked to, leaving large pustules of meat and sauce clinging to the pubic beard he had growing from his face. The yellow jumper was looking coyly at her salad, probably trying to hold back the bile that must be forming in anyone of such close proximity to the gelatinous bulk she appeared to be dating.   Or maybe she was just teasing him, letting him know that she would much rather be with he, the alpha male, rather than the bear that was now transferring the orange gunk on his chin to his sleeve which must have been clean once.   In his mind the truth started to form quickly.  She was only with him because he forced her to stay.  Her family had been in financial trouble, or worse, had been forced from their country due to some terrible war, and the only way for them to survive was for her to be given to this stench of a man.  He bullied her, probably beat her, and defiled her with his sweating mass writhing on top of her whilst she closed her eyes and tried to think of happier times, hoping that the inevitable heart attack would be painful, fatal, and soon.  She saw him of course as a potential release from her torment, but feared leaving the beast for fear of repercussions on her family.  Such a tender girl was she that she would always put others before herself.  He sat and dreamt of her beautiful exotic accent purring softly at him as they snuggled together in the warmth of his bed, that seemed like a haven to her, her olive skin glistening slightly with the efforts of their so recently craved passions. The man beast of course would complain about his intrusion into their lives, and may even raise his mass to fight to keep her.  But what lives were they that he should consider such a beautiful creature his property, and what good would he do against someone so much more lithe and healthy than he.  He would simply fall in exhaustion and tears when he realised what a mess of a man he had become.  But no pity would be shown, and no quarter would be given.  Her white knight would shield her from the beasts pitiful gaze, and his words would strike the beast down, breaking him with his own gaze, so much stronger and then taking the prize so eloquently won.  No longer would she be his property sat forlorn and beaten in her yellow jumper, unable to smile at strangers.  Now she would be with the alpha male, the ultimate prize, and her gratitude would show no bounds.  She would start again.  She wouldn’t need to smile at strangers anymore.  They would buy new clothes, jewels and anything else a woman of her calibre would desire.  His canary would fly and sing again, and they would be happy together, where they deserved to be. The woman in the yellow jumper stood and straightened her clothes; brushing crumbs that no one else could see from her smartly pressed jeans that showed off her slim figure.  Satisfied with her appearance now she picked up her handbag and walked toward the exit, stopping briefly to speak to our hero. ‘The bell’s about to go Simon, make sure your not late for class.’ ‘yes miss.’  He replied meekly. He looked across to where Mr Stephens the science teacher was also standing and getting ready to leave.  ‘He is fat though.’  He though as he sighed and ran a pasty white hand over a pizza sauce chin trying to find the fuzz that might one day become a beard.  There was a waft of acrid sweat as Mr Stephens walked past him which made Simon gag. The bell rang loudly. ‘Bugger.’  He thought and went to English.

      Whilst standing in the middle of Watford today trying to figure a path through the hundreds of canvassers, catalogue sellers and big issue vendors, using a rather complicated combination of maps, charts and satellite technology I was also watching the people walking around me, (or through me, depending on the motor control abilities available) and it occurred to me; whilst doing this, that we have never really escaped from the tribe mentality of our origins.  We may have evolved to the point of being able to kill millions of our fellow human beings in less time than it takes to spill your seed on a picture of Anna Kournikova.  But it seemed to me, looking at the people around me that many parts of our primitive make up, like the tribal instinct, have never, and in all probability, will never, go away.  In no section of the population is this more obvious than amongst the teenagers.    The teenyboppers are setting the trends; like a sheep with a perm.  Flat back, centre straight, fringe crop, pink or blond bob, always different only to end up being the same as everyone else.  Trying to look cool is quite clearly a fruitless pursuit, when the only way to look different as a rebellious teenager now is to shop at Marks and Sparks and wear Chinos with shoes. The cross culture bastardisations have become the norm.  Skinny white kids trying desperately to be black, or rather what they perceive as being black.  They do not try to emulate the proud men that fought the way for equality, and worked to be accepted in a foreign country against all odds.  Instead they lower their thinking power as much as the waistband of the overly baggy trousers they wear, and compensate for the reduced blood flow to the head caused by the smaller amount of organic tissue present, by wearing as a very minimum requirement, at least 12 hoods, hats and caps.  I do sympathise with them though; they are so desperately trying to find an identity of their own, whilst at the same time not wanting to stand out from the crowd, that they latch onto the nearest available group that has even the slightest interest is being different.  Unfortunately for them, this defeats the object of a quest for individuality, as to be an individual in a group of similar people…well, do I really need to complete this sentence.  If I do, please stop reading now, as I intend to move into three-syllable territory very soon. Crossing cultures as a base idea does not worry me at all; in fact I have spent a good part of my own life trying to experience as many of our worlds cultures as possible, and actively support the acceptance and inclusion of the best parts of these cultures in order to improve our own.  What worries me is the choice of role model used to create this pollination of the human flower.  For instance, why choose a semi-literate half wit whose only major ability is being able to talk with rhythm and spit with an echo, of which there are hundreds of copies, when there are truly individualistic trend setters and world shakers from the same cultural background that are surely far more suitable inspirational figures for those seeking to be different from the rest.  The letter X comes to mind. I am convinced that what these poor unfortunates are failing to see is that they are fed the idea that to look, dress and act how they do, by the mass media.  Can anyone else see the contradictory natures of this; or is it just me? All minds seeking individualism, and therefore enlightenment, are massed as one in a gross, pungent pit, of pink and brown pond scum.

      The metallic taste started to build around his molars, irritating his numerous fillings settled in back there. The bus drivers’ assistant was continuing to waffle on about some tree or other, upon which a small army was slaughtered by an even smaller one, apparently.  Ian doesn’t care.  The saliva is flowing over his tongue, which he swallows quickly into his echoing stomach. His wife looks at him, a horn rimmed look on her face, even though she has always worn contacts. ‘Your green, your not going to be sick are you?’ The ‘S’ word triggers something in him, the final mental barrier now starting to crumble. Apparently a famous person who starred in some second rate drivel was caught in the bushes to our right doing strange and nasty things with an hairy invertebrate.  Ian still doesn’t care.  ‘Don’t you dare!’ His ever-caring wife offers comfort.  ‘Sorry!’ he splurts as he lurches forward from his seat, trying to outrun the bile pushing forward through his throat. ‘Sttttoooooppp!’ The drivers assistant rises and turns in annoyance and is met by a wall of carrot related stew for his trouble.

      (not the best attempt I made on this idea, but quite entertaining nonetheless)  &nbsp;  The concrete box that had been their home for the last four months shook violently, forcing all six men to lurch about trying to grasp hold of something nailed down so they could borrow it for balance.&nbsp; The temperature had been slowly dropping to the low singles for the lat twenty-four hours, and they all knew what the final result would be.&nbsp; Power was failing as the fuel store outside succumbed to the weather, and the generator continued to object to being thrown around quite so violently.&nbsp; The transport that would normally remove them from the ice flows wasn’t due for at least another three weeks, and they had no way of contacting anyone any earlier.&nbsp; All they had was a little light helicopter, with a very limited range, that they used for surveying for the maps they were producing for the oil company.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The weather had been unusually warm in the preceding month, and had weakened the ice surrounding them, which followed by the extreme cold snap they were now experiencing had made for a very unstable base.&nbsp; They called the base a concrete box because that was what it was.&nbsp; It was a box of concrete that had been separated into several different compartments for them to eat, shit and sleep in.&nbsp; None of them considered it home, and all of them couldn’t wait to get the hell out of there.&nbsp; It had been a bad idea from the start, and it wasn’t getting any batter, especially now they knew two of them were probably going to die.&nbsp;  When you live with people in such close proximity for any length of time, you usually end up doing one of two things.&nbsp; Either you drive each other crazy ‘shining’ style, and only one person crawls out of the end of it through a sea of body parts and hatred; or you end up becoming closer than you would to a member of your own family.&nbsp; Thankfully this expedition had turned out to be pretty friendly, although a couple of them were starting to think life would be a lot easier if they didn’t like each other after all.&nbsp;  ‘Ok, lets look at the situation guys.’  It was Stephen Gilligar that spoke, the chief engineer on the project.&nbsp; He beckoned for the rest of the team to join him around the communal table where they spent for too much time eating and playing cards for money they would never earn.&nbsp; The other five were Dr Richard Sparks, the resident medic, Peter small, Simon Letterman, and Peter Smith, all engineers, and Rupert Ferrari, the pilot and cartographer.&nbsp; The all came to the table in scared moods, knowing what they were going to have to discuss, and knowing that there was no way it was going to be easy.&nbsp;  ‘Richard, why don’t you start?&nbsp; What does it look like from a survival point of view?’  Richard cleared his throat, brought his hand up to stroke his unkempt beard, which was something they all shared in common, shaving in cold this bad not being a very pleasant thing.  ‘I think we all know that if we stay here we will all have hypothermia within twenty four hours, and will likely be dead inside thirty six.&nbsp; Our only hope is to get back to the main centre where we can be recovered to somewhere warm.’  The already sober mood became slightly more so when they heard conformation of the situation.&nbsp; Simon spoke next.  ‘I have looked at the generator, and its terminal.&nbsp; The ground shakes have cracked it almost into four pieces, and no amount of welding is going to fix it even if we had the material.’  ‘I can concur.’&nbsp; Peter Small chipped in.&nbsp;  Stephen took control again, speaking up to focus the team.  ‘So that’s the scenario.&nbsp; What are our options?&nbsp; Rupert, what is the state of the chopper?’  Everybody turned their heads intent on what Rupert would say.&nbsp; This was the question all of them had been asking in their heads for the last couple of hours, and the answer really was a matter of life or death.&nbsp; Rupert, looked fixedly at the grain in the table wood, trying to bring the words to his throat.  ‘The Helicopter is working fine for now.&nbsp; Its not very stable in is moorings, but should hold for the next few hours.&nbsp; With some simple modifications it could carry four of us our of here.’  He let this sag in the air for a few moments so that they could digest it.&nbsp; Richard spoke again.  ‘Could you come back for the other two?’  Rupert lifted his head this time and tried to look each and every one of them in the eye.  ‘The fact is, we will be lucky to make one flight in the weather.&nbsp; I would place a less than 5% chance of being able to come back, especially considering the battering it has taken already.&nbsp; I’m sorry guys, but its four or none.’  Every single man in the room felt the urge to vomit as the truth hit home with the force of a twenty two-calibre bullet in the guts.&nbsp;  Peter Smith spoke up first long after the long chilling silence should have come to a natural end.  ‘So who goes and who dies, that’s the choice huh?’  ‘Pretty much.’ Said Stephen, struggling to get the vision of his two young children out of his head.&nbsp; ‘I guess the question is, how do we choose.&nbsp; Any volunteers?’  Not a single person raised their hand.&nbsp; Each of them felt that they had a good reason to live, and none of them could think of a good reason to die today.&nbsp; It wasn’t as if these other men were their real family; because their real families were waiting for them back in the UK, completely unaware that not all of them would be home for Christmas.  Peter Smith stood and went over to the drinks cabinet, pulling out some glasses and pouring each of them a large belt of scotch.&nbsp; Stephen went over to help him bring the drinks over, supporting himself on the surface as the guilt of being the leader of this situation hit him full force.  They all received the drinks well, and waited for Stephen to sit back down before drinking deep.&nbsp; They all gagged at the strength, unsure of what would be said next.  ‘Simon is the only one here with no kids you know.’  Peter Small was once again the first one to break the difficult silence.  ‘What the fuck are you talking about!?’  Simon was furious.  ‘You haven’t seen your own kid for four years you know.&nbsp; You’re hardly candidate for doting father yourself.’  ‘Fuck you Simon.&nbsp; We have to decide somehow, and I’m just pointing out a few facts you know.’  ‘Stop it.’  Stephens voice was sedate and calm, but nonetheless effective at silencing the group.&nbsp; There was something in the way he said it that begged questions to be asked, and Peter was not in the mood to be coy about doing so.  ‘Well who do you think should stay and die them Stephen, seeing as you were the one who failed to see this little disaster coming?’  Richard threw a look at Peter that put him firmly back in his seat.  ‘None of us saw it coming, and none of us are to blame.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter now anyway.’  ‘What do you mean it doesn’t matter!?’&nbsp; Simon joined in with the fireworks flying around the room.&nbsp;  ‘It doesn’t matter.’ Stephen repeated.&nbsp; ‘The decision has already been made.’  ‘What?’  This time Peter Small spoke up, puzzled by this remark.&nbsp; Stephen looked at the doctor, and his friend Richard, and took the message from his eyes that Stephen himself would have to be the one to tell them what they had planned earlier before sitting down to this meeting.  ‘I spoke to the Richard earlier about what we had in our medical stock, and what would be the least painful death for those that would have to stay behind, knowing that they would rather not freeze to death in pain.’  He stopped talking, needing help to continue, which came from Simon.  ‘What difference does that make?&nbsp; We still don’t know who we are going to sentence to death yet do we?’  ‘No,’ said Stephen,’ but we don’t have to decide now.’  ‘What do you mean?’ Richard asked, suddenly fearing the worst.  A deep breath, centring his mind before telling them what he had done.  ‘I put the medication into one of the drinks we just had when Peter wasn’t looking.&nbsp; He handed them out, so I could not be influenced in my decision.&nbsp; One of us has drunk it, and the other will go on the chopper.&nbsp; I will stay here on my own and take the rest of the medication when you have gone.’  ‘You did what!’&nbsp; Richard was fuming.&nbsp; ‘You have murdered one of us already.&nbsp; One of us is already dead and you didn’t even ask before doing it!’  ‘Yes, that’s right.&nbsp; It was the only fair way.’  ‘You fucking bastard!’&nbsp; Simon said quietly, but at the same time seeing the sense in the decision. ‘So what do we do now; just wait for someone to start choking and fall on the floor, and hope they do it soon so that the rest of us can fly away?’  ‘Looks like that’s the way doesn’t it.’&nbsp; Richard replied, the distaste choking his words.  The facts sunk in.&nbsp; Stephen hadn’t expected it to be so quiet.&nbsp; The ground shaking periodically did nothing to break the tension, and the wind howling outside, buffeting against the block was easily the loudest sound.&nbsp; He had no idea it would be like this waiting for someone to die.&nbsp; The cold was causing everyone to shake in their clothes, and the eyes were staring everywhere apart from at the people they were with, nobody wanting to watch to others life end.&nbsp;  Suddenly they all heard a slump against the ground, and immediately turned their heads to see Rupert collapse under the table.  No!&nbsp; How had he been so stupid?&nbsp; Stephen watched this fatal flaw in his plan collapse to his peaceful end, as the only pilot in the room died in front of them.&nbsp; Again, nobody spoke, just letting the anger they were feeling simmer quietly, wanting to save the little energy they had.&nbsp; They were all dead now, with no hope of safe escape.&nbsp; They would try and get away, but the escape was unlikely.&nbsp; It was going to be tough for Rupert to fly in this weather, but somebody that had never flown before had slightly less that no chance at all.  &nbsp;The rescue party arrived late the next day, having seen the weather patterns changing in the area they had sent in an icebreaker ship as soon as possible.&nbsp; What they saw was unexpected.&nbsp; A burning helicopter held four of the dead, with another frozen body lay buried in shallow snow outside the block.&nbsp; Stephen, the leader of the group was found huddled inside the block around a fire made from the clothing and belongings of his dead companions, in his hands clutched a mug holding a cloudy liquid; which he rocked back and forth to his lips never quite drinking.

      Hey Rusted Squirrel, how are you?&nbsp; I spoke to my friends about you today (I hope you don’t mind) and they said that we should meet up some time.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; I understand if you think it might be too soon, but I am really happy that we get on so well.&nbsp; I really am falling for you, you know.&nbsp; – Twisted1977  &nbsp;  Paul Rogers, otherwise known as Twisted1977, sat with his feet up on his desk, stretching his arms forward to type messages to the girl he had met online two and a half months ago, and had spoken to via fairycastle.com every day since.&nbsp; It never failed to astound him that they didn’t run out of things to talk about.&nbsp; She had an amazing sense of humour, and an amazingly friendly personality to match her intelligence.&nbsp; He felt comfortable being open with her, and she seemed to be open to him as well, telling him things that she said she couldn’t tell anyone else.&nbsp; Paul felt he knew everything about her apart from what she looked like.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hey Twisted1977, I’m fine, how are you?&nbsp; Hope you weren’t saying anything horrible about me to your friends (LOL).&nbsp; I have been thinking about meeting up myself, but I am really nervous about it.&nbsp; What if you don’t like me when you meet me?&nbsp; I think I would die from embarrassment if that happened.  &nbsp;  Paul smiled when he read this, thinking that he would probably have more to worry about from that point than she ever would, so he replied.  &nbsp;  Rusted Squirrel, I already know that I like you.&nbsp; What you look like doesn’t really matter after that, it just fills in the gaps in my imagination that’s all.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sarah, otherwise known as Rusted Squirrel formed a wry smile and looked to catch her reflection in the mirror on the wall near to her desk where she kept her computer.&nbsp; Not too bad really, she thought.&nbsp; Maybe a little overweight, but not huge by any standards.&nbsp; It was her hair that she hated, with its untameable curls that formed tight ringlets around her head, and the colour that explained why her handle was Rusted Squirrel.&nbsp; He would probably not run away, but might be forced to be polite so as not to hurt her feelings.  &nbsp;  Twisted1977, They are nice words.&nbsp; You always make me feel so special, and I like that a lot about you.&nbsp; I guess I just don’t want to lose you, which I might if things change.&nbsp; I’m falling for you too, but I am afraid of getting hurt again.&nbsp; Please tell me that you wont hurt me Paul.  &nbsp;  Her use of his real name was reserved for moments of seriousness.&nbsp; It was an unspoken code between them that they both held sacred.&nbsp; Paul knew where this was going, and wanted to move it there as quickly as possible.&nbsp; He knew at this point that they would soon know what each other looked like, but that it would take just a few reassurances to get them there.  &nbsp;  Sarah, I promise that I wont ever intentionally hurt you.&nbsp; You are an incredible woman, with such a big heart, that I could never bring myself to break it.&nbsp; I just hope that you feel the same way about me.&nbsp; Why don’t we swap photos first if that makes it easier for you, as long as you promise not to send me one from the choice catalogue.  &nbsp;  This moment of flippancy at the end of what she saw as a tender reply made Sarah relax a little.&nbsp; She loaded up the scanner to her right before replying to her distant love.  &nbsp;  OK Twisted1977, you asked for it.&nbsp; Here it comes now, and I want you to be honest when you reply.&nbsp; If you don’t like the look of me, say so now rather than be polite.&nbsp; I know you will if I ask you because you always say the right things to me.  &nbsp;  The photograph took several minutes to work its way onto Paul’s screen, and when it finally appeared he looked upon it with a happy heart.&nbsp; He saw a pretty faced woman with the most stunning green eyes he had ever seen.&nbsp; A head of fire that seemed to spring from her very soul ringed her porcelain pale skin.&nbsp; She was beautiful, and he felt thoroughly undeserving of her.  &nbsp;  Sarah, you are so pretty I can barely breath.&nbsp; How could you possibly think that I wouldn’t like you when I saw you?&nbsp; I just hope that you can reply to me with equal honesty when you see me.&nbsp; Here it comes.  &nbsp;  This was quite painful for Paul; so he treated it like removing a sticking plaster from a hairy piece of skin.&nbsp; A deep breath, then quickly doing it before he had time to change his mind.&nbsp; He pressed the send button and waited for the fireworks to erupt.&nbsp; Nothing came though.&nbsp; He waited for five minutes, then ten, then fifteen, and nothing came back at all.&nbsp; He was tempted to prompt her with a ‘Well?’ or a ‘what do you think?’ but thought it best to let her make her own decision in her own time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  An age seemed to pass since Sarah had opened the file containing the picture of the man she had grown so close to over the past couple of months.&nbsp; A slow tear followed the path made by the others that had been shed as she stared at him.&nbsp; He was smiling broadly; in they way that she had imagined when they had joked with each other online.&nbsp; His words seemed to have more impact now that she knew what he looked like, and she didn’t know how to deal with the feelings that had grown so quickly inside of her.&nbsp; She suddenly realised how long she had kept him waiting, but wasn’t ready to talk to him yet, so just sent him a very short note instead.  &nbsp;  Paul, I need a bit of time.  &nbsp;  He read the message as it was displayed in front of him, and his heart sank.&nbsp; He could sense what was going through her mind, and he couldn’t really blame her.&nbsp; No woman in her right mind would ever want to be seen with him in public.&nbsp; A man like him was meant to be alone, and deep down he knew that to be true.&nbsp; He had deceived her in a way, and he knew that she wouldn’t be coming back to him, no matter how much time she had.&nbsp; He didn’t bother replying to her message, but instead sat for a while, allowing the facts of the situation to settle, before reaching over to turn off the computer.  &nbsp;  Twisted1977, you are so beautiful.&nbsp; Sorry I took so long to get back to you, but I needed a little time to get myself together.&nbsp; My heart cant stop beating as fast as it is.&nbsp; You have the most wonderful smile to match your humour and your kindness.&nbsp; I am so lucky to have found you.  &nbsp;  Paul’s heart skipped a beat, and his stomach filled with a thousand flying creatures that just wouldn’t settle down when the message came up.&nbsp; He looked at the picture of the woman he cared so much about, imagining her green eyes looking into his as he sent his return message.  &nbsp;  Rusted Squirrel, we are so lucky to have found each other.&nbsp; Thank you so much for seeing me as I am.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Sarah sniffed through her tears, and carried on tapping away, talking to the man she would meet very soon she had decided, and the man she was very quickly falling in love with.&nbsp; On the screen, in the top right hand corner, was his picture, his feet up on the desk that he sat at when talking to her, his hands reaching forward towards her, and the smile that filled his face so radiantly.&nbsp; The frame that supported him, and stopped his spine twisting him forward any further gleamed in the background.&nbsp; He seemed quite comfortable with it, as if he had been in it for several years.&nbsp; She wondered if it was an illness that had done this to him as she arranged the date and time for the first meeting.&nbsp; Either way it didn’t matter.&nbsp; He was beautiful to her.&nbsp; She saw in him all the qualities she dreamed of.&nbsp; Humour, strength, bravery, kindness, and love.

      For best continuity read 'Beaten' first   Sarah heard the car pull up in the driveway, and the knots in her stomach tightened a little more.  The car door slammed shut, and footsteps scuffed towards the front door.  The key found the lock and the door opened and Sarah grasped at the damp tea towel nervously in her hands, using the kitchen top to support her weakening legs. Her husband didn’t come through to see her though, instead walked up the stairs, the fifth one creaking loudly.  She stood rigid in the kitchen pushing her-self against the corner of the work surface trying to shrink her-self to nothing.  The footsteps above her were in the bedroom now, things were being pulled to the floor and dragged around.  She listened keenly as the heavy footfalls made their way into the office room, more crashing, then the second bedroom, more crashing, then the stairs started to creak again as he made his way down.   Sarah’s breathing started to quicken, her muscles squeezed tightly as her body began to shake like struck by an unrelenting frost.  She listened to each step as it came closer, through the hallway into the living room, then pushing at the door to the kitchen.  A small whimper escaped from her throat that took her by surprise, and her husband entered the room, a fire burning in his eyes that scolded her silently before the shouting began. ‘What’s wrong with you?’ No reply was necessary or advisable; she had learned that very early on in their marriage. ‘This place is a fucking pigsty, what have you been doing all day you lazy bitch, watching television sat on you arse, or have you been screwing around with someone else?’ ‘Of course not!’ She couldn’t help herself, the words flying out before she had a chance to stop them.  Her next reaction was to cower as the first blow landed on the side of her head. ‘Don’t you dare shout at me you little whore.  I’ll teach you who runs this house!’ She was silent as he grabbed her wispy blond hair and threw her across the room, crashing into the table and three chairs that served as the dining area. ‘Ill teach you to screw around when I’m not here.  I’ll make it so no man will want you when I’ve finished with you!’ He advanced on her, grabbing the boiling kettle on his way, which he then raised above his head and smashed over her.  She felt blood trickle from the wound that resulted on her forehead, and she closed her left eye to stop it flowing inside.  Scolds seared into the flesh on her arms and torso sending her into a brief state of shock that helped numb the pain. His strong left hand grasped her by the throat and pushed her back onto the floor whilst his other hand ripped at her beneath her skirt. Oh God, not that, she thought.  He’s going to rape me. It was vicious and quick, but none the less scarring.  Blood flowed on her thighs as she crawled into a foetal ball when he rolled from on top of her.  She could hear him breathing heavily from the effort of exertion, before he stood and went to a cupboard to fetch a biscuit for himself.  Between bites he turned to her again and looked puzzled at her reaction. ‘What’s wrong with you?’  He mumbled through crumbs, spraying the floor with food debris in the process.  ‘Don’t you like making love to your own husband anymore?’ Sarah issued a guttural sob, and sniffed in reply.   ‘Answer me when I ask you a question.’ She could hear in his voice that he was winding himself up again for another round, but she didn’t really care anymore, her will low, just strong enough to let her stay curled up in a ball and wait for the inevitable. ‘ANSWER ME!’ The first kick struck her in the kidney, winding her badly as she struggled to breath.  Then she felt the rough hands grab her ankle and drag her into the living room where he would have enough room to do a proper job on her. ‘Come on then bitch, lets see what you’ve got shall we?’ His words sounded demented as he spoke them, as if he didn’t even realise it was his wife he was beating.  He dragged her up to her feet by the shirt collar and dealt her a thundering punch to the side of the head, then picked her up and gave her one that echoed loudly on the other side to match.  His fists specked blood from her face, but that didn’t slow him down in the slightest as he jerked his head forward in a violent motion breaking her nose.  The look on his face was glass, showing little or no emotion, just calculated moves designed to cause her as much damage as possible.  His rage had turned in on itself and resurfaced as pure cruelty. Her eyes started to close up with the swelling around the broken eyes, and his fist crashed into her left ear causing a slight popping sound before the squealing started in her brain that would take several weeks fade away.  She started to lose count of the amount of times he hit her, but didn’t stop feeling the pain it caused.  Darkness flitted over her eyes as she started to suffer from brief blackouts, a small rest-bite, only to wake again to face more blows.  A feral growl started to emit from her husbands throat as he lost control of his actions completely.  Sarah could barely breath now, and truly believed that she would die this time.  He had never been this bad before.  She had been to the hospital a few times with the odd broken bones, called the police out once or twice only to tell them it was a mistake and that she had been mistaken about her husbands’ intentions.  He had received a warning and a caution, but had always managed to get out of it somehow. Usually because she gave him an alibi, by falling down the stairs more times than would seem possible for even the clumsiest woman, or dropped the charges she could have held up against him due to some misguided loyalty.  This time it wouldn’t go that far because this time she would die, and it wouldn’t hurt anymore.  She looked forward to it.   ‘LEAVE HER ALONE!’ He spoke aloud, but it wasn’t his voice.  Sarah could barely see now but could just about make out his lips moving when he spoke, but the voice sounded different, but still familiar. ‘LEAVE HER ALONE YOU BASTARD!’ She knew it now.  It was louder, clearer, and she knew the voice.  She croaked recognition begging for help and knowing it would come immediately. ‘Mum, please help me.’ Her husbands’ body was flung backwards instantly in reply, crashing into the dresser on the far wall as he cried out in shock. ‘YOU LEAVE HER ALONE!’ His fists, bloody with fluids from Sarah’s face and body started pounding at his own head whilst his body threw itself from wall to wall, into furniture and crashing into glass and china causing large gashes in his face and body.  All the time he was crying out in pain and anger not knowing how to regain control.  Sarah smiled as much as she could, feeling a couple of teeth fall through her lips, well lubricated, onto the carpet.  Although blurred she saw him smash all the plates and glasses he could find onto the floor and then skid face first through the shards, blinding him as his eyes were cut, and gagging him as his throat filled with blood.  This made the sounds coming out of his mouth distorted, but she could still recognise her mothers’ voice as she continued to curse the man that had caused her daughter so much pain.   As quickly as it started, the movement stopped, and the sound with it, apart from the laboured breathing coming from Sarah’s chest, and a panicked gargle coming from her husbands throat. ‘No, no, no, no, no!’ He had mustered every last ounce of will to regain some control over his own body, but still that was all he could manage to say as he brought up a shard of glass to his chest and thrust it deeply into his own heart killing him instantly.  As he fell to the floor, finally dead, Sarah saw his lips move mouthing his final words. ‘Nobody hurts my little girl.’ And Sarah smiled again.  The police took her directly to hospital when they finally arrived at the scene.  They looked in disbelief on Sarah’s tiny frame after seeing the carnage around the house.  The man was dead, so they covered him up with an old sheet until the coroner could come to pick him up.  It was clear what had happened to everyone who came into the room.  Sarah was an abused wife who had taken one beating too many, and she had been infused with an almost supernatural strength when she had finally fought back against this man who was almost twice her size.  They were in awe of what she had done, and knew that no court in the country would blame her for killing him.  It was clear self-defence, and this was confirmed to her over the phone by the prosecution service as she healed in the hospital.  The only thing that didn’t make sense was the report of the female officer that had been by her bed when she had woken up.  The first words that she spoke, before she even opened her eyes fully, or as fully as she could through the swelling.  It didn’t make sense because she didn’t have any children. She said ‘Nobody hurts my little girl.’

      The vicar was speaking, but the ringing in Sarah’s ears was still too loud to hear him properly.  She squinted through her swollen eyes, wincing slightly with the movement.  Her hair hung limply by the side of her face hiding the worst.  Old habits die hard she thought as the spring breeze cooled the burns on her arms through the black cotton blouse that billowed around her small figure.  The police had taken one look at her, and the record for her husband and hadn’t even considered pressing charges.  The Crown Prosecution hadn’t even wanted to meet her, just having a brief conversation on the phone to put her mind at rest. ‘Its all over now Sarah.’  She had said.  ‘You can go on with your life now and not have to worry about him ever again.’ And yet she found herself standing next to his open grave on a crisp spring day amongst the people that had known him, and had loved him, despite all his faults as a human being.  His mother was sat sobbing into tissues supplied by the daughter sat to her left.  His father sat to the right staring intently at Sarah, silently blaming her for their sons’ death.  It had seemed obvious to everyone that Sarah had killed him, but she had been told by the investigator that she wasn’t to blame.  That she was only defending herself in the eyes of the law, and that she should be proud of what she had been able to do.  Sarah’s brother Tom stood next to her, as the sole representative from her side of the fateful marriage.  The vicar turned to the family and spoke something that was muffled to her, and then turned to Sarah and spoke again.  It took some prompting from her brother before it was understood that the vicar had asked her if she would like to say a few words about the deceased.  Sarah nodded slowly and stepped forward, each movement an effort.  She straightened her skirt before she began, and coughed quietly. ‘Nobody deserves to die the way he did, but I cannot bring myself to feel sorry for him, only for his family, who never knew their real son and brother.  I hope for their sakes that he is able to rest in peace.’ The sounds were distorted by the newly missing teeth but the message made it across adequately to the people sitting across from the grave.  Whether or not they decided to listen to her didn’t matter, only that she had the opportunity to say it.  They responded with a silence that lay heavily in the churchyard. ‘Take me home now Tom.’ They turned and walked slowly out of the old iron gates toward the car park together. It was a short drive thankfully as Sarah found it uncomfortable for the entire journey, wincing when Tom turned a corner, or went slowly over a speed hump, but finally they made it back to her home, a small semi-detached house in a town where nobody spoke to anybody else.  Not even the homecoming of a known killer and her brother could stir so much as a curtain twitch.   ‘Do you want me to come in?’ Tom spoke pensively, not sure what his sister wanted.  Nothing had been said to him about the incident apart from what the police had told him when he had picked her up at the station.  Sarah thought for a moment before turning to her brother slowly and saying in a voice that was almost a whisper. ‘Yes; I think there is something you should know’ Tom helped her out of the car and followed her closely up the short driveway watching carefully.   She fumbled the key up to the lock and they entered the house together looking around at the mess that met them.  Broken furniture, smashed banisters, stains where the police specialists had cleaned up the blood.  Tom reeled from a strong smell that filled the air.  Sarah didn’t react, instead made her way through the carnage to the kitchen where she automatically reached for the kettle and some teabags.   They both grasped their tea and made for the living room where Tom had found a piece of furniture that had survived to sit on.   Sarah placed her mug of tea on the dresser and remained standing whilst Tom sat down on the wooden chair, mug grasped before him like he was trying to keep warm. ‘I want to tell you what happened Tom.  I think you have a right to know.’ Tom stayed where he was, and waited for her to compose herself. ‘He wasn’t drunk you know.’  She Started.  ‘He never was.  That was just one of the excuses I made up to make it seem better somehow when he hit me.  He was just an angry man, and I couldn’t keep him happy.’ She stopped and silently scolded herself for giving him excuses, and started again. ‘He would come home sometimes, and be the sweetest guy.  Would tell me to get into something pretty because he wanted to take me out somewhere and show me off to the world.  I would be so happy when he would do things like that.  He would make me feel so special, like the princess in all the stories with her prince charming.  Then other days he would come home and he wouldn’t say a word.  He would just throw the door shut, drop his coat on the floor and walk from room to room, slowly winding himself up before coming to the kitchen where he knew he would find me.  Of course by then I would be shaking; physically shaking like I was so cold I couldn’t control it.  I knew what was going to happen you see.’ She looked at her brother who urged her to continue with his eyes, but not saying a word, understanding that this was the time for her to talk. ‘He would shout at me about the state of the house, or if he had found something out of place when he did his little tour he would hold it up to my face, screaming at me like I was a badly behaved pet.  I learned very quickly not to try to argue of course.  That just made it worse.  It was better just to stick it out and hope he wouldn’t hit my face so that I could go to work the next day.’ She paused, thinking back to when it had all first started, about how it had gone on so long. ‘Five years Tom.  Five years.  That’s how long he had been doing it.  Five years, four months, and three days since the first time.  We had only been married a few weeks, and I thought it would be a one off.  I believed him every time like a stupid bitch when he said how sorry he was, how he would change, get help.’ A small laugh at her past ignorance caused her lip to open up, and a blood tasted in her mouth, the familiar metallic feeling that had no good memory attached to it. ‘It wasn’t me that stopped it in the end Tom.’ He sat up a little, not quite sure what she was talking about. ‘Do you remember when mum was alive, how she would go round to other kids houses if they hurt us, or bullied us and scream at them, threatening them with all sorts of dreadful things if they even thought about hurting us again?’ Tom smiled at this.  Their mother was a formidable woman with the kindest heart imaginable.  Sarah was very much like her, apart from the strength.  Their mother had a presence that would scare the devil himself, and they knew they would always be safe when she was around. ‘It was her that saved me in the end Tom.  She was the one that stopped him, in the end.’ She stared at Tom daring him to not believe her. ‘You found strength in her memory.’ She looked annoyed. ‘No.  It wasn’t a memory.  It was her.  He had hit me around the head with that chair, the one you’re sitting on now, knocking me down, and started kicking me all over. I thought that it was over.  I was barely conscious and wanted to die so it wouldn’t hurt anymore, and I called out for Mum.  I screamed her name, desperately wanting her to come and chase the bullies away again, and she came.’ ‘Sarah, mums dead, it couldn’t have been her.’ ‘It was her.  I couldn’t stand, and nobody else was in the house, then I called out to mum and she came and saved me.  She grabbed him, screaming like a feral wolf, and flung him away from me like he weighed nothing at all.  Then she started hurting him.  I lay on the floor, hurting like hell, coughing up blood, and sobbing because he had raped me.  He’d never done that before.  And I watched our mother take that bastard to pieces.  She threw him around the room and hit him with anything she could find.  All the time she was screaming at him, but I couldn’t have heard her really so I thing the sounds were mostly in my head.’ Tom placed his hot mug on the floor and made to stand, worried about his sister, that she had been broken in more than her body.  Sarah just stood defiantly as if she didn’t care whether he believed her or not. ‘Tom, it happened.  I couldn’t have done those things to him because I was too weak, so it must have.’ Tears forced their way through the slits that were acting as eyes for her as Tom put his arm around her shoulders.  Softly so as not to hurt her.   ‘Its ok Sarah, its ok.  I don’t know what happened here exactly; all I know is I am glad it did.  I am glad he wont ever hurt you again.’ She turned her head to face him, and look him directly in the eyes. ‘Do you know the strangest thing Tom?’ She didn’t wait for him to reply, but simply carried on regardless. ‘I couldn’t see her at all.  I couldn’t see anything.  Just his body flying around the room, bleeding, breaking, him crying out instead of me, but it was her voice, and I knew it was mum.  I knew it was her come back to keep her promise.  She never left us Tom, never.  It was his lips moving, but it was mums voice; and do you know what she said Tom?’ He just looked at her waiting for the answer. ‘Nobody hurts my little girl, nobody hurts my little girl.’

      There he was happy as larry and crazy as a bucket of frogs.  Strong cheap can of lager in hand, at eight in the morning he smiled at passers by as he sang his song, not seeming to mind too much that people were looking anywhere but at him.  The smell of stale urine on his clothes did nothing to dampen his mood.  He was happy for the time he was under the influence of the demon brew.  It numbed the pain of the life that had been dealt to him.  Addiction was not his disease.  It was his escape, and he would stay there for as long as he could afford.

      (With thanks to my old friend FG for this piece of inspiration)  Cold side of the bed Where you used to lie The back of the chair  Where your coat used to be Your mug left unused  for so many days now Im sure the bottom drawer  Still smells of you Toothbrush in the bathroom Or tape in the car Why cant I throw it all away Rip here on the pillow I told you to turn it over Cork from the wine bottle Beside two glasses A half burned candle From when we were  Just to think of you Im broken Just to touch you I am broken Just to see you I am broken  Come break me again  Camcorder tells of your  Efforts to decorate Patch on the wall  That you never completed Everyday the mail through the door Printed all in your name To life I cling As I enter the door Your key in the lock As I sit and wait The cat still goes to look for you The toast is still set on high The toast you liked heavy black The window left open Too high for me to shut  Just to think of you Im broken Just to touch you I am broken Just to see you I am broken  Come break me again

      Hi all.  Sorry but I have fallen a bit behind with the kind of writing that actualy pays the bills, so all I can give you right now is a short taster of the next story, which will be posted as soon as possible in its entirity.  Enjoy.  DN    'THE OLD ONES'   He sat in is wheelchair and looked across at the frail creatures he had once called friends, all struggling not to stay alive, but for some reason never being ranted the release of death.  The bugle sounded the last post, the haunting sound mocking the five men as the started to envy the fallen comrades of the war so long past.

      The figure passed between the beds in half-light as the children slept.  He paused at each small body for a few moments, before moving on to the next in an almost seamless progression.  A slight noise in the white bathed hallway as a porter pushed a gurney past the double doors.  The figure stopped completely until the porter had passed, then continued on his passage until every child had been visited, then he moved out of the room and onto the next where the ritual was repeated, and then the next, until every child in the wing had been visited.  A sob could be heard as he retreated through a doorway into the basement, where he seemed t6 disappear.  ‘I don’t understand it; these kids were definitely ill yesterday.’ ‘I know doctor, but they are showing no symptoms of pain at all now.’ ‘What is this, some kind of miracle?’ ‘I really don’t know doctor, but I don’t think we should complain about it, do you?’ ‘No nurse I do not.  Look, why don’t you go and call the parents; tell them we treated them overnight, and they showed great response to a new drug or something.  The last thing we want is the tabloids coming over here talking about crying madonnas or such like.’ ‘Of course doctor.’ Doctor Stevenson stayed in the room looking at the children, his mind almost refusing to believe what was in front of his own eyes, and confirmed using the knowledge he had amassed over the past twelve years.  He shook his head clear and walked to his office, avoiding the areas of the hospital where he might have been accosted to administer to somebody else’s patient.  He turned off his pager and sat down, closing his eyes, unsure of whether he should be thanking god for a miracle, or someone, or something else.  He was confused, but pleased for the kids nevertheless.  Those kids were on the critical ward, all suffering from painful cancers, or other diseases that would eventually have killed them without drastic treatment that would have made them worse before they got any better; and he was just glad that he wouldn’t have to see them go through that now.  In the basement of the hospital, a lonely figure sat on a small wooden stool in front of one of the boilers, shaking, even though he could not have been cold.  Tears rolled down his cheeks, forming rivers of clean, where there was only grime before.  He whimpered quietly to himself, with nobody else to hear him, and his mind treated him to visions of his daughter, so beautiful before she died.  He had prayed to god that she would be able to get better, or that she wouldn’t suffer if he was to take her from him and his former wife, who had died soon after their daughter, not wanting to continue without her.  His fate had been a little crueler in the end.  He had been able to take away the pain of his family, only to learn that he would suffer far worse because of it.  He discovered soon that pain didn’t just go away; but that it had to go somewhere else, and it had chosen him as its vessel, and it was close to unbearable.  He shuddered as an electric pulse shot through his nerves to join the others that already lived there, and tried to console himself with the thought that if he was feeling it, the children weren’t, and he knew that no matter how bad it got, he would be back out there tonight for more.  Doctor Stevenson was writing a report in the encrypted file that kept the records of all of the strange incidents that had been happening over the last few months.  The nurse stood over his shoulder confirming some of the details in his head, so that he could be sure that everything was accurate.  The parents had been delighted when they had come to collect their children, and had thanked him profusely for his efforts, which he accepted because it was easier than explaining the truth; whatever that was.  The last few words appeared on the screen as he typed them, and he asked the nurse if she agreed with what he had written, then he encrypted the file and sent it to the inspector handling the investigation.  They had both decided to contact the police when they had heard reports of the man wandering around the wards the night before they had made each discovery, and although he had been sceptical when talking to the doctor, he had been more receptive when the nurses involved had backed up his story.  They had an idea of who it was, but they didn’t realise the harm he was causing until it was far too late.  Four of the children were dead now, but were showing no symptoms of the illnesses they had been suffering from before they were released from hospital, which meant that there was no way that any doctor would have known how to treat them; hell, they didn’t seem ill at all, so why would they treat them.  The doctors and nurses at the hospital at first thought it was a miracle, but now they were seeing it as a curse.  If they could no longer tell what was wrong with the children, then they couldn’t treat them, and then they start dying for what seems like no reason at all!  The police wore white coats, and looked almost indistinguishable from the doctors that were accompanying them.  The children they had chosen were sleeping in B ward, many heavily medicated so that rest was possible.  They kept their distance so as to not look like they were watching the ward with undue attention, and to allow the visitor to come as normal.  It was near to 1 AM before they heard the basement door move.  The lead detective signalled everyone to be alert but quiet as his mind and eyes woke up completely to take in the scene before him.  They heard him whimpering like a scolded puppy whilst he shuffled uncomfortably through the hallway, heading to wards the nearest ward, ward A.  He entered passing by each bed, looking intently at each of the patients before going to the next, but made no moves on any of them.  He left ward A and crossed the hall with his slow awkward shuffle and entered the target ward B.  The surveillance cameras that had been set up whirred quietly as the tracked his movements, but he paid them no heed.  He passed by all the beds until he reached the far end of the room, where he turned and approached the bed furthest from the door.  The figure, cloaked in a dark blanket, worn like a shroud stood over the small sleeping figure of a young boy of about eight years old.  The watchers were sure they could hear sobbing from him as he passed his hand over the shape of the body, without actually touching it.  They prepared themselves for action as he reached inside his clothing for something, brushing the hood aside first in order to gain a better view of his subject. ‘That’s enough, it’s a positive ID.’ The detective spoke briskly into his radio. ‘All units close in for arrest.  Subject appears to be unarmed.’ Two of the beds tipped over as the police concealed beneath them revealed themselves to the crying man. ‘Hold it right there; don’t move.’ He jerked his head with a cry, and backed towards the wall, his shuffling motion almost causing him to fall.  Four others, who approached the man without hesitation and grasped his arms to make the arrest, quickly joined the two policemen in the room. His skin felt like damp velvet and two of the men reeled to the touch, but the arrest was made, and the man was taken away.  In the basement they found where he had been living, a small stained mattress on the floor, and scraps of food, stolen from the canteen at night.   In front of the boiler there was a cross, made out of items he had found around the hospital, at the base of which were dried patches of blood.  He had been there for several months, and Doctor Stevenson now knew where he had been before.His daughter had been resident in this hospital, with his wife.  They had been involved in a nasty car accident and were in considerable pain from where the vehicle had caught fire before the firemen had rescued them.  It was unlikely they would survive through the next few days, but the doctors had decided to try to keep them conscious so that they could gage how well they were responding to treatment.  They had died soon after Robert Johnson had visited them, for reasons that were only revealed much later when the bodies had been exhumed and subjected to a post mortem.  It seemed that it was too much for Robert to cope with when he had seen his family in so much pain, so he had returned to his business where he had worked as a chemist, and had brought back a poison to give to his wife and child.  After they had died he had disappeared, apparently into the basement of the hospital where his mental health deteriorated considerably.  He had been using chemicals on his own body, causing burns; and had cut himself in several places over his body where he rubbed in various substances to cause himself enormous levels of pain.  Perhaps he was trying to atone for his sins, but more likely he was simply deranged after losing such a large part of his life.  He was safe now, in the county psychiatric ward.  The children he had killed though, were not so lucky.
