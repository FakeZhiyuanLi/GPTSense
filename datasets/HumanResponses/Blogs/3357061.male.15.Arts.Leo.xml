      I seem to be making a habit of posting in the START of the day and not the end of the day. Ah well, guess it'll take care of anything that might happen during the night. Well yesterday I was trying to play a game on my computer and it happens to crash or freeze up every 5 minutes, go dell!  Well after a day of literally putting my foot down on the subject and heard something fall out of place I decided to stop that and go make some food to drown my anger, my parents and sisters were out of the house bowling, they do that every Sunday and Thursday. So I'm all by myself for about 4 or 5 hours and get to do whatever I want, lucky me eh?  After I was done eating I wanted to draw for a bit then go to sleep but my desk is so damn tiny there was no room *cry*. If I don't clean my desk up every other day it becomes very messy, my whole room is the size of an office cubical. Being the youngest in my family hasn't done any wonders for me. Well I guess that'll be all for today, stay tuned for more tales of....uh...ah screw it. *turns off*

      Well decided to make my own blog cuz I thought it'd help with my boredom that I seem to experience 10 out of 12 hours im alive every day. Had one hell of a time trying to get a username though, everyone took all my names. Luckily I had my trusty future-ship's name, the H.M.S. ProgenY. It's gunna be the name for my ship in a game i'm going to be getting near Q4 of this year(or so the dev's say). It's called Pirates of the Burning Sea, sorry not pirates of the carribean....disney already took that one. It isn't released yet but the beta they said starts sometime BEFORE the release date, phew eh? So it should start sometime summer/fall, can't wait to beg my parents to sign the NDA agreement that you APPARENTLY have to be 18 to sign. *swish* Me - 0, Gov't - 19823462385289, woohoo!  Since it's like 5:40 AM here in Cali(SOON TO BE NEVADA! Hooray!). Yes i'm going to be moving sometime early next year, we're thinking about moving to a new-founded place near Lake Tahoe called Spanish Springs, soo can't wait to get out of this place. Here in a place called Thousand Oaks(doubt you've ever heard of it, in 6 years of searching only 1 person has so..). As i said before, i'm bored prettymuch every waking minute of my life, i have no friends, I was pretty much RUN out of highschool, I was the biggest loser in school. I wonder day to day if I went back just to smite them I wonder how cool i'd be, i've changed a lot since I left. I'll never feel sorry for the next-in-line loser at my old highschool, ALWAYS betrayed me to the popular group who never kept their bargain with him anyway. PS. Yes im a loser and the biggest nerd in the whole town but just for the record im not fat or wear glasses or talk in a high squeeky voice like the common nerd stereo-type, I weigh 125lbs and im around 5'9".  After many hours of searching i finally found a song i like made by the Aquabats - THE best Ska band ever. I'm gunna make a movie of the song i searched hard for, has to do something about eggs if anyone knows this. It's gunna be made on a game called Counter-Strike and a mod called ChickenMod. So if you ever come across funky rock/carnival music involving chickens and KFC(if you become hypnotized by them like the rest of us and listen past 15 seconds), that's my movie.  Well I don't wanna ramble on so that's all for today/yesterday.
