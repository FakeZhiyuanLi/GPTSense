        hi Best fren,  Wkend has just passed. Was a wonderful one. In my earlier blog, i did mention tt I have this strong feeling tt chong will nt be able to make it on sat night. Too my surprise, he sms me on Friday afternoon, asking if me & rest wld like to go 2 his hse at woodlands. I was elated !  Boon Wee was a real pain, such indecisive abt his decision.. wasted my time and money on him, sad. ultimately he came to chong's hse too. And I also know from chong tt he had casued so much "trouble"  Wild wild wet was disappointing ! Nothing much, only had one try for per ride and spent $12.50. I guess Wild will not survive in no time. Took many photos at wild, they turned out to be beautiful. Frankly, thank god for giving me such a group of frens- PX, Xiaoching, Berg, YK, David, Janice, Chong, Kelly & etc. They added lotsa spices to my life. Thanks..  1st time to chong hse at woodlands. The house was great and can see that he spent a lot of effort in decorating the house. Chong played Sax while me and rest are mahjong-ing. Though I was playing the mahjong, but i appreciate alot of his talent on sax. Beautiful ! Again, i met chong too late.. Stop dreaming Cynthia, You shd not harbour any tots on chong :( .. " I know, at least Im appreciating him"  Spent my Sun at home lazing and sleeping. Life is beautiful with friends ard.  And I treasure the moments with them..................... Till next !  Love 23/8/2004

         Hi my best friend, how's ur Sun? Mine was BAD ! Spent 12 hours at Hyatt Hotel and facing 70 students.. Really tiring , hv to take care of the tinky little things and many customers request. But got praises from them that they are impressed that i can managed such an event ALONE !               Kinda proud of the compliment leh.. :) The most impt is I seen them all happy with what Kishore had teached, I think this is called Satisfaction no matter how long or tired i am. Ultimately if your cust are happy, Im happy too !               Came back and  nw having my dinner.. Was checking my email at the same time and was browsing through an interesting email sent by CHole- is all able Palm Reading. Fascinating sia.               tml another Monday.. somemore hv to work till 3am in the morning and by the time i come home , is gonna be 4 am. Sianzzzzz Wat to do, is my job la. but seriously speaking I think I got to start learning Options. Muz start my investment liao, students hv been asking me.. Sigh. sometimes is ashamed too being an employee of PowerUp with Kishore as a gold mine in front of me everyday and I have NO ACTION ! Please Cynthia, do something to yourself!               K lah.. Give a halt here.. Clear up my noodles and get to bed.               Nite dear !              Love        15/8/2004

Many fond memories are shared between us. Thank god for giving me these friends esp Chong.. He is a mentor, a lecturer, a good friend to me. I have yet to find any friends ard me who can makes me give a good listening ear and respect.. But he did it ! I really wanna tell him how much i appreciate him. But each time i see him, I kinda shy.......... is it..Hmmm. But I will def wld like to let him know one of these days when I have the courage.               PX is jusst another good friend of mine, though we dun share much abt hw we feel nor know her much, but she just a good company. She given me lotsa of laughter by bickering with me.

         This is my 1st time using online diary.. was influenced by Karen. Seriously, dun really know wat I shd write becos my writing skills are poor and it had been years I have not been writing diary. But I think is a good habit though.. got good influence like Karen, I think I should make it a habit to pen down my feelings.              I have given this diary a special name "~ My BEst FrienD~" . I think  "you" will be only one who will know in and out of me.              Today is wkend and really thought of enjoying myself but sad.. got to work and today Im handling abt 70 students and have been running in and out to ensure the workshop is run in the best situation without any hipcups. Anyway, today im pleased with my own performance, sometimes i really wonder, where the hell I have the ability to run one- man show, but kinda proud abt myself that I managed to do it ~! Cheers ..         Got a surprised message today. My Primary school mate asked me for mahjong session.. Sigh.. I cant join in the FUN. Also, received a call from BenJamin.. muz comment abt him, since his wife is pregnant, he had not been calling me. i joked with him but he did explain that cos of his work. Well, well.. but is a good thing that he didnt call me as often as in the past, he is Still a MARRIED MAN. But of course, nice to hear from him and I can sense that he is really happy to chat with me over the phone , can hear  that he had been grinning all the way although is only a short conversation. \        Oops.. didnt realise that I have wrote so much. Time to take a rest for tml workshop, got to wake up early.         Good night my best Friend ~ Till Next          Love 14/8/2004
