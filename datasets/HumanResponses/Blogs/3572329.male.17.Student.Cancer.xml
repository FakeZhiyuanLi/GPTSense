      got back from the cruise yesterday!  It was so much fun.  There were lots of shows and people and pools and such.  But what topped it all was.... ICE CREAM!  ice cream is extremely good, and I probably ate 20 pounds of it on the cruise.  Who cares thoughhhh?  I have nothing else to say right now I'll probably post again tonight once I get thinking?  can't you look at me once? and please if you've got a minute enjoy this lonely sky with me it'll swallow us whole if we only let it

      when deadbolts awake you from deja vu dreams, at four in the morning you know where I'll be. out running red lights asleep at the wheel. the sirens feed my nightmares,  i just close my eyes and I'm already there; its already too late. i know its nothing but lies, but they sound so sincere; i find them too hard to hate.  and she calls from the doorway "stolen water is so sweet, so lets drink in the darkness if you know what i mean" and she calls from the doorway "stolen water is so sweet, so lets drink in the darkness if you know what i mean"  and I'm almost sure that I've been here before, that this is not the first time I've stood in front of this door, with an overwhelming feeling that i shouldn't go in, but it seems this is a battle that i never could win.  and you! my true love! you call from the hilltop. you call through the streets, "Darling don't you know, the water is poison." and i say!  "come on and give me my poison."   what have i done.? is it too late to save me from this place? from the depths of the grave? we all are those .. who thought we were brave. what have i done.?  Good song. Deadbolt by Thrice.  tired.  Carl, Tommy, and Jason came over to watch the game.  Got a  little  hyper and blew off a whole bunch of energy.  That's about it.  Seriously quit it with the cunt shit, it's not even funny anymore.  I feel like BLAH.  I want to hang out with people from school that I don't normally hang out with so if you're one of those people IM me and we can work something out.  Going on vacation on Friday, a cruise.  Fun.  I'm just scared I'll be too shy to get to know anyone.  Pistons won, hurrah.  I'm trying to be happy for you but it's not working too well.  It's probably because I have the energy of a pet rock.  I'm out, later

      So last night I went to the Chronicles of Riddick movie with Tommy, Jason, Jerry, and Matt.  Jason said it was like the best movie he's seen in a long time and Tommy didn't really like it. I thought it was OK, worth the money but not much more than that.    Once again it started out as a sunny day and now I hear thunder.  Why does the weather have to suck so much?  I enjoy Galaga wayyyyy too much.  Yes, Galaga as in the 80s arcade game.  Tommy has it at his house and I'm like obsessed with it.  In other news frozen Ding Dong snacky things are extremely good.  Some other things that are going on in my mind right now: -Whoever posts comments as anonymous and enjoys using the word 'cunt' needs to find a constructive way to use their limited comical talents. -It's been too long since I kissed a girl -I really like to think and have alone time. -I like music a lot. -Thursday is probably one of the best bands ever. -Cursive is my new favorite band.  Yeah, I added a shoutbox, try not to have too much fun with it.  Laterrrrr.

      Hello again,  Sorry I haven't updated, I've been at Tommy's since Friday afternoon.  Not really much to say, Carl and Jason were here on Friday and only Jason last night.  So yesterday, Tommy decides he wants to upgrade his computer.  He says we can go to Bestbuy, he's seen their motherboards and processors. He's  seen  them.  So we head out to go to Brighton, we get to Bestbuy, look around. Lo and behold, we can't find any.  So I figured this is the part where Tommy is trying to make me think this was a totally useless trip.  It wasn't.  It actually was a useless trip.  Not really though cuz I picked up a new game.  Fun.  I'm out, later.

      Last day of school!  I'm finally over with it.  Took math + history exams today, nothing too complicated  After school I came back here and talked on AIM and such for a bit then Jason and Tommy came and picked me up to take me to 'ann arbor' to go to a car parts 'store.'  I guess Ann Arbor is a codeword for Howell and a car parts store is code for a JUNKYARD.  So I spent an hour and a half or so running around a junkyard doing random things.  Fun stuff.  I tore off a rear-view mirror to give to Kyle Raymond at school as a joke since his is broken but then I realized I'm not going back to school for months.  Came back here and just hung out for awhile, until Ryan IMed me asking for a ride to Dan's.  At pretty much the exact same time, Tommy asked if I wanted to do anything with him and Corey so I picked Ryan up and drove him over to Dan's then went to Tommy's.  I accidently burned out at the corner of Whitewood and M-36 lol.  So I went over to Tommy's and we did some more random things.  Corey, him, and I piled into the car and drove to Brighton, went to Bestbuy and drove around for a long time, got some food and such and came home.  Went to Cap'n Frosty's for some ice cream and went back to Tommy's.  After like 10 minutes at his house, they decided they wanted to go to Corey's.  So again we got into the car and went over there, watched some of the Pistons game while Corey and Tommy took turns playing MAtt on Gunbound.  Then we decided to go get Corey's Xbox from Ian, did that, took them back to Corey's, decided I wanted to go home, and here I am.  Sorry, I'm rambling.  Well that's basically my day.  Melissa moves tomorrow I think, sad day.  She wrote on my arm again, it was like a farewell, sad.  At least I can talk to her online sometimes.  But still.  It's just not the same.  Well that's all for now, later

      I think I might lock this to select people just because I know some of you might try and use it against me and you already have plenty of ammunition.  I feel yucky now, both physically  and  emotionally.  I've been doing random things to keep my mind off of everything but it's not really working.     Jamie modded his case with a fiberglass window and a red cathode.  He also drilled some holes in the fiberglass for 2 more fans.  It's actually pretty cool.  He overclocked his processor to 2.8 Ghz, a pretty decent increase.  Classical music is really good to calm down with.  Every note played is really beautiful.  Yeah, I'm weird.  Deal with it.  Writing is making me feel better so I'm just gonna keep rambling, lucky you.  I cannot wait for school to be over with, I can't wait to sleep in.  I'm actually really feeling better now that I'm getting this all out.  I'd appreciate it if the comments be kept (mostly) serious.  Yeah.  Thank you for being my friend.  Later.

      blah, I don't feel well.  I feel lonely.  Crappy weather.  Nothing to do.  I think maybe I'll sleep because the bed doesn't seem so cold anymore.  sigh.  I'm beginning to think life sucks.

      Exam week is finally here, both fortunately and unfortunately.  On the upside we have school ending this week, and on the downside we have... well... exams.  I mean, not that I can't handle them, it's just that there's so much going on in such a short time.  Anyways, Something Corporate's music just makes me feel great.  And it's weird, so does she.  She doesn't even have to try, and she just brightens my day.  It's really amazing.  And these nights I get high just from breathing. When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real, like that firework over the freeway. I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel.  Amazinggggg.  That's all for now.

      Yeah, I didn't really like my old one at all so Ryan showed me this site, thanks for that Ryan.    Exams for the next three days, but then I'm home freeeeeee.  I really can't think of anything to say right now, you can basically sum up my day in a few words.  School, Studying, and Swimming.    Kind of in a sad mood right now, I don't really know why.  I think it's just one of those 'blah' days.  It'll get better later, hopefully.  I am really not in the exam studying mood.  We did this trivia thing in 6th hour and the girls (Melissa, Katie, Jessica) on my team basically talked about how big their chests were and how many boys  and  girls they've kissed.  In fact, Melissa has kissed more girls than guys I guess.  Rambling is fun.  I'm out.  By the way, I have it set so anyone can post comments on my entries, not just blogspot members.

       See all those people on the ground   Wasting time   I try to hold it all inside   But just for tonight   The top of the world   Sitting here wishing   The things I've become   That something is missing   Maybe I...   But what do I know     And now it seems that i have found   Nothing at all   I want to hear your voice out loud   Slow it down   Without it all   I'm choking on nothing   It's clear in my head   And I'm screaming for something   Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all     On My Own    /      i sit and hear you sleep    i don't want to go    youre there beside me    but youre so far away    i talk to you    while youre asleep    you can't say a word    you can hear everything       tears are feelings we cant say    tears mean that you care    tears are mixed emotions    tears are more than tears       the pouring rain    from my eyes    means too much    to keep inside       i sit and watch you leave    my life forever    i know youll be gone so long    my last words are nothing    and i tell you i care    and nothing more    i can't say how i feel    so i cry       tears are feelings we cant say    tears mean that you care    tears are mixed emotions    tears are more than tears       it's the light    behind the shadow    that sacred face    behind the mask

      I finally decided to get rid of the shoutbox thanks to some really annoying people.   Wow I have totally nothing to say.     Tommy, Jason, and Carl went on vacation and wont be back for like 8 days and they SUCK for it because they're like the only guys I hang out with besides Corey :(. Jamie turned 16 today and got his license. And from what I hear from my brother, he's a pretty crazy driver. Crazier than me? Of course not. I wouldn't actually know though because I WASN'T INVITED. I know you read this Jamie, I drive you everywhere and you leave me here to be bored as all hell :(. I really love Linkin Park. They're like my outlet if I need really loud music instead of my normal pop punk/emo stuff. I was looking at ringtones to spice something up a bit and I found Lover I Don't Have To Love but it's a totally sucky one, they didn't do it very well.     I really hate the night. As I told Sam earlier, it's like 9084390478981278912374029302178 times harder to stay content with what I have than during the day.    Good night people.    --Aaron

      It was my brother's b-day yesterday.&nbsp; He turned 13. &nbsp; I'm sorry for the lack of updates but I really have nothing to say. &nbsp; I bought The Bourne Identity, it's a really good movie.&nbsp; I want the stars to come out, even though I have noone to watch them with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blah. &nbsp; Why do you guys fight in my shoutbox?&nbsp; It's just trading random insults for no reason whatsoever.&nbsp; And I don't even know a Steven so apparently it's attracting strangers.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you don't&nbsp;want to read this, 'Steven', fuck off and don't.&nbsp; I honestly don't care whether you read it or not.&nbsp; I'll still write in it regardless. &nbsp; --Aaron

      hola  Here's my day:  1. Got up at 12:30 or so 2. Just hang out at Tommy's 3. Dirt and Ryan decided to stop by when they saw my car in front of his house 4. Came back here and had the house to myself for a few hours.  It was nice. 5. Talked to Sean on the phone for awhile 6. Parents got home.  As usual, made fun of my hair. 7. Parents tell me I have errands to run tomorrow 8. Wondered why I have so many Sum 41 songs  Not much for you to read about, unfortunately.  I really have nothing to say.  For you, it's been almost exactly 2 months.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  So far no signs of your amazingness dulling.  --Aaron

      Sorry for the lack of updates  Anyways,  Saturday night I watched the stars with Stephanie and we traded stories. Here are some things I learned:  1. Jimmy my old manager is even more yucky than I thought he was 2. Anything that's not a star but has lights on it can be considered a UFO 3. If you do a little dance, a mosquito will just go away apparently 4. If you say any random word relating to color it'll make the smoke stop blowing towards you from a fire 5. Constellations are hard to find. (except for "that guy's belt" right Steph? :p)  Moving on to Sunday...  Got up, ate breakfast, did nothing. Waited for my mom's friends to show up.  When they finally got here, they followed us over to my godmother's house and we were there for like 2 hours.  Fun.  Went out to dinner.  Didn't have anything.  Got back here.  Did random things.  Went to sleep.  Here we are.  and I may have been slightly intoxicated last night so if I IMed you acting really weird you know why  --Aaron

      Hey everyone.  Just got done reading Perks for the second time.  It was just as wonderful.  Thank you so much for the book Stephanie, it means so much to me.  You make me smile to the point where it hurts, but in a good way :).  And your memory is amazing lol.  I got up at around 9:30 today for absolutely no reason.  Yeah yeah, it may not be that early but I didn't have to get up yet.  Cleaned up because my Mom's friends were coming over, got in the shower, did everything else associated with getting ready.  I had the especially interesting task of driving 4 boys to Subway.  Stephanie wants me to try on some womens' pants lol.  Make fun of me all you want... but I just may...  Yeah, if I had said this awhile ago I would've been embarrassed, but who cares, I'll wear what I like and grow my hair how I like it and it won't phase me if someone else doesn't like it.  I really really hope it stays clear tonight, I want to look at the stars and lay in the grass.  And think.  Yeah, this is really bad grammar but I've decided who cares lol.  I'm in such a good mood, I know it doesn't sound like it but I am, trust me.  I love you all.  I really do.  --Aaron  and I decided to throw in this thingy  Copy and paste into your livejournal.

      Let me start this entry on a happy note: I'm not depressed anymore!  I know you guys were probably getting tired of me after a week of being down in the dumps, but my problem is gone.  I hang out with Stephanie last night, which was cool.  We went to Borders and saw Colleen McWhinnie there, she's changed so much!  I saw her mom there as well, it was kind of cool since I've known that family for about 8 years now.  Wow!  OK after we went to Borders we decided to hang out at the Millpond.  We were walking all around the boardwalk thingy and the first time we walked around it we saw this 18-ish year old girl and like this 40 year old guy sitting on the bench and I assumed they were father and daughter.  We walked back and they were making out.  It was so wrong, he had to be twice her age.  I noticed it was 11:11 in the car and we both made a wish.  So I got back here at around 11:30 and I settled in and decided I wasn't unhappy anymore.  In fact, I'm happy.  I got up this morning at around 9 and went out for a day with my family.  Well, kinda. It was my Mom, my two brothers, a friend with each of them, and I.  I swear I can control my brothers better than her, and they were getting pretty out of control, so it's a good thing I went with.  Got back here at 4 and have been being lazy until I decided to post a serious entry.  And here we are.  Ooh I decided it's time to announce my favorite band for next week: Rilo Kiley.  Post some comments on the shoutbox or something.  Preferably nothing about me being stinky or uncool.  Calling me cool and/or saying I smell good is accepted.  I'm out.  --Aaron

      Yesterday my friend and I were writing an essay about luck in the Dark Ages. We were very shocked by the whole thing, so we asked my friend Tamika about it, and she screamed:    " Get out!.. No kidding?! I am so sick of hearing about  the Dark Ages all the time! "    But then when my friend and I got to the part about the luck, Tamika ran away all of a sudden. And then this morning, Tamika's brother told me that the reason Tamika was so freaked out was because she used to write a lot about luck. Sometimes Tamika can be a little  unpredictable like that, but she kinda loves me...      Link of the day:   All Your Oil...  | Randomly generated by  urlLink  Flooble Instant Blog Post Generator    lol.  I TOTALLY GOT A GMAIL INVITE.  exciting but it shouldnt be.  I have to work on my thing for Steph today ;).  Can't say what it is though because she reads this.  Sorrryyyyy Stephanie.  OK OK I've decided that if I get some invites of my own to gmail I'm gonna give the first one to Tom, the second one to Tommy, and the third one to a soldier in Iraq because they're over there fighting and I hope if I donate this a soldier can talk to their family and maybe even receive some video of their kids or something since the mailbox is so big.  I LOVE YOU SOLDIERS IN IRAQ!  Oh God I'm spiraling into not happiness (I dont want to say the word sad it seems to make me that way) but I'm kind of numb because I've had a lot of sugar.     -- I'm sorry I can't be perfect.

      you know I'm here waiting for you.  Went to Tommy's... stayed there for a few days.  Got home, didn't have any energy for a few hours.  Got in the shower, went to the neighbors for a cookout.  I'm always not good enough for anyone... why?  I just wish once that I was more than enough and there was nothing wrong with me.  But I'm seriously subpar so I guess it doesn't work that way.  BLAH.  music: coheed - three evils

      Ok, it all started when someone started spamming nLk's irc channel with a ventrilo server's info and said it was for a freestyle 'battle.' I joined and it took awhile to get started but finally people were like ripping each other apart. Josh and Matt kept saying Gabe was a really good rapper and he got targeted in this one guy's rap. So everyone thinks Gabe is this extremely good freestyler and they tell him to go and instead of saying anything he starts blaring this old diva-type song with a really funky rhythm. I was laughing so hard I was crying. A few battles later and after Ryan joined, he decided to tell them I'm really good. So I start talking on the mic and they all want me to go. In the meantime, Matt wants to scrim and gives me the ip/pw so I join and then the guy that I was going against started rapping and he was really good. OK I'm still in a scrim on CS now but it's my turn. I have no clue what to do so I sit there for a few seconds... then I just start singing an old Spice Girls song that I shouldn't remember the lyrics to. They all laugh at me and RYAN haha starts singing along and thats the last thing I heard before I got banned from the server. I'd still say I won my freestyle battle, so 'you'd better recognize.'  CPL Finals  SK got totally destroyed by EYE, so I guess it's cool that there are new champs but I wish the US would bring it home.  Jason and Tommy and Carl get home WEdnesday, we can finally get nLk started. I'd say I'm not doing too bad for being inactive for a few months, I've been putting a lot of frags on the board.  I hope everything goes how you want it to go if you've figured that out yet, I hope he knows what he wants and you're happy in the end.  Good night, people.  Also, I was looking around my whole web/programming directory and I found some of my old Java work and realized how HORRIBLE of a programmer I was just a year ago.  I mean, who needs the 2 while loops to check for a win in tic tac toe when you can write 8 separate if statements amounting to at least 3 times the work that would've been done on the loops? I'm thinking since I know the general syntax I might be able to teach myself the rest of Java.  I've also been like literally absorbing the whole PHP functions list in an attempt to be a better coder.  If I'm bored enough tomorrow I'm gonna make a web-based FTP client cuz I'm cool.  Oh yeah, that and because the IRC module for PHP is not free (probably isnt too hard to crack though.)  Yeah either that or just write random scripts and make them come together and do something useful.  Only one person I know will have any idea what site this is a ripoff of:   urlLink JoshTeam   I'm just going on and on and on.   Ryan can play some mean Celine Dion.  We made hamburgers at 5 in the morning yesterday.  I HATE HAPPY COUPLES stupid commercial.  John Grisham writes good books.  The school overcharges for yearbooks.  I have a sound curse on my computer!  1 soundcard hasnt worked, 1 was way too low and before that just decided to randomly stop working and come back.  3 pairs of broken headphones (2 of which I did NOTHING to.)  1 pair of broken speakers (Ok I admit I broke those.)  Sean came over and spent the night 2 nights ago.  Every time I look over at my dresser and see the trendy green cover of the book I smile.  Dashboard Confessional is a good band.  I have a sad life, don't I?  --Aaron
