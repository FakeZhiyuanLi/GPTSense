      I live in mortal fear of not wrapping things up properly.  Food things, I mean.  I think we must spend more money on cellophane than we do on food.  I could check it out, if you want.  It’s all there on MS Money somewhere.  Some theologians have speculated that the conscience is simply God’s way of talking to you.  Well, if that’s true, he has a particular hang-up about cellophane.  I admit to being a cellophane sinner.  I know it’s wrong not to wrap half a packet of frankfurters up because all the water drips all over the fridge. I know it’s wrong, but I still do it.  I can hear that voice in my head telling me to go back, open up the door and do the sensible thing, but I ignore it.  When God speaks to me through my conscience he sounds a lot like Kathryn (my wife).   What’s worse, God?  Not wrapping food-things up or telling lies?  You know my dilemma this evening.  I snook out to the kitchen and just happened to see a brioche loaf of chocolate chip crème patissier from Sainsbury’s lying on the worktop.  It had been opened , and the packaging carefully wrapped back so that nothing was left exposed to the air lest staleness should ensue.  I thought I’d just have a bit.  I’m a sucker for crème patissier even though I can never spell it properly.  How many times did I ask you to lead me not into temptation today?    It was delicious.  Then I tried to wrap it back up in its original plastic wrapper.  Of course, the wrapper split.  I think Sara Lee and Cellophane must have forged an agreement about easily-splittable packaging some time ago.  Isn’t there a law against that sort of thing? Well, I’m not giving in to this 21st century need for cellophane, I’m sorry God.  So what choice did I have?  Leave the brioche to go just a little bit dry by morning, or eat it and accept the consequences.  That was half an hour ago.  Now I’m scared.  I think I can feel some lies coming on.

      Thursday. Oxford. Chomsky.  There in plenty of time, so we spent an hour or so in Blackwells.  More time to kill, after all it didn't start until 5.30pm, did it, Tom?  So next door to the White Horse, or some similarly named previous haunt. Tom even remembered the tickets - and to think I had doubted his organisational skills.  5.10pm.  Plenty of time to saunter over in the May sunshine and take up our place among the great and the good of Academe in the performance area. Except, it didn't say 5.30pm on the ticket.  5pm, more like. As we circumnavigated the Sheldonian, trying every locked door in our search for the elusive entrance B, it rained for the first time in weeks. A round of applause emanated from inside and confirmed our lateness for this particular party. Increasingly bedraggled, on the verge of giving up, a minion rattled open entrance B.  So much for the red ticket.  Up the stairs, no seats, a mumbling American accent was audible, presumably that of the Chomskmeister.  Sounds which might have been words.  I had to laugh.  I couldn't stop.  It felt like an episode of Seinfeld.  'My mum is going to kill me'.  Next storey down. At last a seat, at the back by a window.  25 feet behind and to the right of the speaker.  I could see 5 empty seats down there where we would have been sitting. I also saw the back of the Chomsk's bobbing head, and heard some words of his own brand of anti-American wisdom. I do not know, though, if his colour came up.  Power cut.    Without a microphone, the Chomsk carried on, but the sage did not see fit to raise his voice above normal speaking volume.  Dons and students cupped hands to ears, fidgeted restlessly, contorted faces like piano tuners trying to spot the wrong note, straining to grasp these pearls. Filling in the gaps themselves, no doubt. Maybe it was good.  I'll never really know.  But it lasted an hour and a half and I can say I was there.  Tom's mother can't.  She failed to show but her tuna and carribean chutney sandwiches were delicious.  I had a vision of her at 5.30pm, standing drenched in the rain outside the theatre, cursing the day she had given birth.

      So I have discovered my Nemesis, my Lex Luther, my Newman.    And he is a low-talker.  A very low-talker.  His practiced, calculating, seductive whispers create havoc in the psyches of the vulnerable, and they have no tears left for me.   I am SUCH a jealous god!

      Several hours after casting my vote in the euro-elections, I dined with four friends.  Knowing their political persuasion to be generally centre-left, I confessed with some trepidation to having just voted for the Green Party.  It transpired, though, that they had voted similarly, unbeknownst to each other.  I am quietly optimistic, therefore, that Sunday night’s European election results will surpass the Green Party’s own expectations.    I have never voted Green before, and only considered it this time after reading their manifesto.  Hitherto blinded by a prejudice of the Greens as bearded hippies, I was surprised to discover that it is not a one-issue party, and that its policies on a whole range of issues - education, globalisation, decentralisation, Iraq, the single currency and CAP reform - have been carefully considered and resonate with me.  I emerged from the voting booth more satisfied than at any previous election and with a sense that, for once, I had voted for a party with whom I was in broad agreement rather than for simply the lesser of three evils, as is my usual General Election habit. If politicians are serious about improving voter turnout, then they can not ignore the sense of positive voting inherent in proportional representation.  Some will point to actual voter turnout at these elections as evidence that PR does not boost electoral participation, but that is too simplistic.  I suggest that our first-past-the-post system has created an oligopoly of political parties and denied real choice to voters. This has generated the cynicism with politics which leads to low turnout in all contemporary UK elections.  Tinkering with a postal voting system will not redress such cynicism.   If my optimism about the Greens is justified, we will be in already-chartered territory .  The Greens were the surprise package of the 1989 European elections, securing 15% of the UK vote, but failed to replicate that success in any subsequent test of electoral strength in this country. History may well repeat itself, for our electoral system creates a real barrier to entry in UK General Elections.  If we really want politics to be infused with new ideas then how can we justify continuing a system that favours the established parties and their ossified thinking?  We cannot expect these very parties to reject a voting system that guarantees them a rotation of power at least once every generation.    In my view, the Greens should attempt to form an alliance at the next General Election with all the other minor parties which attracted votes at the European elections. The sole aim of such an alliance would be to transform the voting system to one based on PR. Only the BNP, with its views repugnant to the vast majority of the electorate, should be excluded.  The selling point of such an alliance would be simple: if you are cynical about politics, if you think the established political parties offer no real choice, if you wish to register your disgust with the choice available, then vote against the electoral system which has created this situation.  Such an alliance might not win a single seat, but could win a share of the vote sufficient to undermine the political legitimacy of the new government.  The pressure to reform our electoral system might then become irresistible.  I can think of no better way for those who feel politically disillusioned and effectively disenfranchised to voice their opinion and change the face of British politics.

      I hope the Euro elections on June 10 matter to you as much as they do to me. In recent years I have become VERY politically apathetic. It is now hard to believe the elation and excitement that marked Labour's victory in 1997. It would have been impossible for Labour to live up to the expectations of their supporters , but I NEVER expected the sense of disappointment and anti-climax to have been as great as it has turned out.   I can't vote Labour any more because they have disappointed and disillusioned me by:  a) getting involved in an unnecessary war  b) bringing a culture of bureaucracy and gravy-train management consultancy to the public sector, especially education  c) latently supporting the single currency  d) doing nothing to reverse the long-term trend in inequality in this country  e) making Higher Education a commodity, by charging for it.   I can NEVER vote Conservative because they deserve never to be forgiven for introducing the culture of me-first-ism that is now the United Kingdom's unfortunate hallmark. (If you think about it, 'New Labour' has just been the opportunity for a particular generation (now about 40-60 years old) to operate me-first-ism as well)   I can't even vote Liberal Democrat as I usually do because:  a) they have got a blind spot when it comes to the Single Currency  b) only this week, a LibDem spokesman has encouraged the church not to get involved in politics. Hey! - politics is THE moral issue!   There is only one party that I can conceivably consider supporting in the Euro-election. I have never voted for them before. I have never really considered voting for them, not least because our General Election system discriminates against them. This time it's different though. The Euro-elections are held under Proportional Represenation, which means that any party which attracts at least 10% of the vote is guaranteed to win some seats. That means that every vote will count.   And I am unhesitatingly casting my ballot in favour of THE GREEN PARTY. Why don't you read their manifesto by clicking  urlLink HERE ?   I have looked it, and I am surprised to find myself in agreement with very mainy of their main policies.   It's about time democracy re-asserted itself in this country again, and a great way of giving the main parties a wake-up call would be to kick them in the teeth by voting Green this time.   LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE APATHETIC. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT LESS THAN 25% OF VOTERS WILL EVEN BOTHER TO VOTE AT THIS ELECTION.   THE ONLY WAY THAT THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE YOUNG AND THE MARGINALISED IS IF THE YOUNG AND THE MARGINALISED CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO VOTE.   NOT VOTING IS SENDING THEM A SIGNAL THAT SAYS 'DO WHAT YOU LIKE - I DON'T CARE'.   IF YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET.   THAT MAKES YOUR VOTE EVEN MORE INFLUENTIAL AND MORE IMPORTANT THIS TIME.   Please, read the Green Party's manifesto, and if you think it makes sense, vote for them on June 10.    urlLink Green Party - Real Progress

      Someone from China keeps looking at my web-log (wonder who?) and I feel guilty at not having provided an update for them in such a while.  So here goes.  It’s six years (or maybe more) since I last visited the cinema – maybe even longer.  I can’t even remember what the film was.  Possibly ‘ urlLink When We Were Kings’ .  That must be even longer ago than 6 years.   In these days of ultra-convenient technology, I am more inclined to wait for the DVD to come out than to try and get a babysitter for the night.  And I dislike Hollywood blockbusters with a vengeance, so it takes a very special film to arouse me from cinematic apathy.  The film I saw tonight was.  I knew it would be because I saw the film which it sequels a decade ago.  The sequel is  urlLink ‘Before Sunset’ , starring the luscious Julie Delpy and the fortunate (but I am very jealous!) Ethan Hawke.  I am no film critic, so please don’t expect a concise little review of the film here.  Other web-sites can do that.  Suffice to say that, like the original, there was virtually no plot to speak of, virtually no dialogue outside the two main characters, great acting and complete intensity.   The original,  urlLink Before Sunrise   (interesting little allusion to James Joyce's Ulysses  urlLink here ) appealed to me ten years ago, because it was about people of my generation (OK, five years younger maybe!) and their thoughts on life, philosophy and meaning.  It was suffused with hope for the future, and a certain romanticism. It is an utterly beautiful film, and any intelligent twenty-something should see it.  I have vague (maybe suggested!) memories of intense delightful, meandering conversations like the one it portrays.  The ones where you really find a wavelength with someone about something, and it goes on forever but feels like just a few minutes have passed. Alas, Ms Delpy does not star in my autobiography.  In Before Sunset, the characters are 10 years older (aren’t we all?), both physically and in their perspectives on life.  I don’t mean old as in stale.  It’s just that, clearly, life-experience has eroded, but not extinguished, the romanticism of being 22.  Although I don’t completely identify with either character, I found plenty in the dialogue from both which resonated very profoundly with me.  There were some lovely little quotes I would like to jot down and stick on my wall - but I was trying so hard to keep up with the intensity of the dialogue that I didn't manage to make accurate mental notes of them.  There were also some of those spine-tingling moments that I only usually feel at some Van Morrison concerts, or life-changing moments like marriage, or being present at a birth.  Or seeing my children’s faces on Christmas morning. You know what?  As I get older, those spine-tingles are the things I really live for.  But though it’s a great film, I would only recommend it to the over-30s.  I think you need to have lived a little in order to empathise with these characters.  If you’re fortunate enough to be twenty-something, it might just seem like a couple of oldies whingeing!  See ‘Before Sunrise’ first and make an appointment in your diary to watch ‘Before Sunset’  in10 years time.   On the other hand, if you’re thirty-something or older, don’t wait for the DVD to come out, and prepare to fall in love with Julie Delpy all over again.  Not only does she continue to look angelic, but she sings like an angel as well J.  (You can even buy  urlLink her CD  - it's a mixture of bliss and darkness!

      I have watched youth blossom.  From the balcony I see  Expectant hearts  Dance hope into tomorrow.   You flowed past with vitality.  I touched you momentarily,  A rock washed in the mountain stream  Of your journey to the sea.   Now water swirls with oil  A dance of hope and desolation,  Marbled puddles paint the platform.  I am the railway station.   One last look, an act of faith  I leave without a trace.  Partir c’est mourir un peu.  I have died to you a little.

      A very relevant story for current Year 12 students going in to Year 13.  Module 4 is all about the UK travel industry.

It also shows how a loss-making firm is attempting to restructure in order to safeguard its long-term future.   urlLink Click here to see BBC NEWS | Business | Embattled MyTravel narrows losses
