      hey  Vardan , thanx a lot for all the encouraging words..it really felt nice..well i was very hesitant to write an online diary..but just like everything else in life,i had decided to give this a try too..its gradually becoming an addiction and hope that before it grips me completely i would be out of it..but so far so good..read your profile and liked the "keep grudges" part of it..well no matter how much one says that they forget and forgive..i dont think they really can..i feel that even they know that they cant...

      After speaking to two of my most favorite people in the world yesterday, realization dawned on me. One ingredient that makes our life a complete bliss and relationships Work --- Distance. 	 They said “ keep your distance ,don’t involve yourself too much into any one’s life, be nice to all and not too close to anyone.” That’s the recipe of happiness.Maybe,I was thinking about the same thing, but couldn’t point a finger at the exact solution. One day and two phone calls later, the solution is crystal clear. It seemed as if it had always existed but I couldn’t see it.  Now I realize that I am going through a strategic inflection point, “it is the time in my life, where my fundamental beliefs are about to change” Thank you Mr. Andrew Grover for telling us about this concept.  Well at 24,maybe it’s a little too late but I think when they say “Its never too late to learn”, they are damn right. I have finally learnt it, learn it at this age and learnt it the very hard way. And I am sure that this learning will last me a lifelong.    “A lot of things go unquestioned,  A lot of questions go unanswered,  A few words go unsaid,  A few go unheard,  Some dreams are buried,  Some dreams are born dead,  That’s life !!!”    Read this in a Short Message Service – but I know that it will live with me for the longest part of my life…..what a paradox!!!

      As you stand in front of the mirror,you wonder if u like the person you see..    Is the person you see,the same that you always admired? Is the person staring back at you,say the same things she always did? Is life taking its toll on her? Is she gradually losing her own reflection? Is she still having the dreams of a simple happy life? Is she gradually losing her identity and fading in a crowd? Is she still loving herself? Does she still cry, when someone rebukes her? Or has she started moulding into a stone? Does she love someone more than herself? Does she love anyone at all? Will she see herself in the mirror again? The mirror doesn't think so...Does she?

      Its going to be three years..three years of being in love..three years of bliss...and trust me ..love does finally free you...free u from the pain.. All my life i had wanted to meet someone..someone who would completely floor me..sweep me off my feet and maybe there would be the bells ringing madly and i would know that he is the one..divine intervention.. but it didnot happen that way..he met me..and quitely took my heart away..and before i could realise that..i knew i was in love..and this love was diferent from the ones that i had felt before..It enveloped me in the sense of fulfillment..of contenment..and i am still recouping.. As the days pass by,i feel that i am growing insane..and i feel it is so very diferent..its intoxicating..and am i enjoying it!! I can just say that.."he completed me"! and now when i sit back and think about the experiences i have had in my life ..I laugh out loud.. After losing the person who meant the world to me in a freak road accident..i had felt that my world would never be the same again.. Now when i think of that person..i can feel that he is smiling form the heaven above..and i am quite sure he is finally happy..just to let him know up there..i still love u ...but maybe now i am not lonely..i have someone who will take care of me all life long..but i miss u a lot too...  this post is dedicated to DS,a person who has given my life a meaning..  AS the lead actor in the movie "the beautiful mind" says,    "you are my reason to live....you are all my reasons"   its just like that..thank you

      I say...   LOVE ALLOWS YOU THREE MISTAKES....... AFTER THE FIRST ONE..YOU FIND A BETTER PERSON.. AFTER THE SECOND ONE..YOU FIND TRUE LOVE.. BUT AFTER THE THIRD ONE..YOU NEVER LOVE AGAIN!!!    Well..I had made two mistakes,now seem to be in "true" love zone..life is like one happy ride..  Unfortunately had felt that twice before..but woke up to realise that in a relationship,the equation of love is not always balanced..But this time I have finally managed to balance the equation!.Its one hell of a job!! :-)  Mr Putin..listening? You dont fall in love once..Its just that,next time, YOU DONT FIND LOVE , LOVE FINDS YOU  !!!

      They say Its a dogs world!! How very true..When i had walked into the MBA class for the first time,my father had said,"MBA is a battlefield,to survive and excel,you have to fight". For the first few months I made friends,partied and basically had fun.. Litle did i know that gradully,life would change.. We had not shown our "fangs"..Maybe now we have and its a matter of survival.. The rule is that there are no rules..we just have to play on!!..and thats what i am doing.. They again say..Everything is fair in love and war.. I say,everything unfair is fair in love and war!!! So war is business and business is war.. what am i waiting for..let's get down to business now..

      Hi!!! its been quite sometime since my last posting..its been one hell of a week..presentations,industrial trips,movies,reflections but not necessarily in that order. Thursday was entirely spent in Kolar,the gold town..though much of gold isnt left.We had been to BEML,the indian version of "caterpillar"..it is an ISO 9001 company but the sate of affairs- disappointing..Well we had ealier been to toyota kirloskar ltd,this experience was far form that..maybe by the time my great grand kids grow up all the indian companies would practise TQM,5S,JIT,..hope that day comes..:-( Well after the tiring trip ,we had to prepare for the book review..well the book in question-"only the paranoid survive" by andrew grove,its so very apt for us.The presentation had been made well but executed poorly..thanx to two of my team members who had forgotten the lines..well paranoids didnt survive,,Mr grove listening?? Well the best part about saturday were the compliments that i recvd for wearing a saree..mr putin..i did look nice..u have to see me to belive that .. And the bestest part abt saturday.."YUVA"..amazing movie..hats off to mani ratnam for making that movie and proving all over again that he's leagues ahead of all the other film makers in India..and the best part of the movie-rani mukherjee..shes mind blowing!! well sunday started on a bad note..couldnt go for an important fuction..thanx to the downpour..but in the evening braved the rain and waded through the dirty water to chat with 2 people i care abt the mostest in the world.. Sometimes,I feel that maybe love is the mother of all destinies , Sometimes,I feel that I am walking on a path which cannot be retraced, Sometimes,I feel that i am cheating myself to belive things i wouldnt want to, Sometimes,I feel that had i not looked the way i do,i would have been happierin life, Sometimes,I feel that had i not looked the way i do,i wouldnt have found "true" love, Sometimes,I feel that apart form the person i love,maybe i love someone else too, Sometimes,I feel that is wrong..coz its not right, Sometimes,I feel ,will the perosn ever know how much i had loved him and how much he had hurt me, But...thats only sometimes..  well..weekend reflections.. but now its back to work again.. have a great week guys..

      well the day is finally drawing to its end..and i surely thank god for that.Its been one of those days that everyone dreads. To begin with i woke up late in the morning to find that the college bus had already left!!And after a mad rush when i did finally manage to reach college,the lecture had already begun and my professor bestowed me with a discourse on "how to be punctual".  That wasnt the end of it,in that afternoon we were instructed to do a book review on saturday in front of a panel of distinguished people who would rate our academy on communication skills in the All India B-school ratings..  And to add to the owes,all the servers in our area were down ,which  delayed our preparation.  Now that i finally did manage to locate a net cafe with a functioning server,my floppy disk is corrupted... AAArgh!!!  Life sucks!!!  love u all...

      This is my first blog and it was inspired by a very close friend o mine.I had never thought that i would share my journal with someone,leave alone people i donot know. But as they say in life..Expect the unexpected ....thats what i am doing now.. Hmmm... no introduction yet..The name commoner is to state that I am an average girl with a dream of a happy life..But as days pass by,the dream is turning into a mirage. In this era of modern methods of communication,i still love the smell and the feel of a letter written to me in a sheet paper.I know that maybe in a crowd i would never be noticed,making the term "commoner" even more apt..but thats life and i am happy that way. By the way i am doing my post graduation in mangement and right now sitting in our crowded computer lab making my entry in to this new world..and I can see my class mate waiting patiently to use this very computer when i vacate.. As of now..this is Me..the commoner .. Love to all..and all u guys have a great time ahead.. till then..byee

      Saw the movie   "monster"  yesterday..well was enamored by the acting prowess of charlize theron..but i pray they donot remake this movie into a hindi flick..hope the bhatts read this...the movie is really awesome..and i have to admit that no matter how much we celebrate the maturity of bollywood movies(atlast!),they are light years behind such kinda film making...kudos to Patty Jenkins for extracting such a performance!!!

       3 commit suicide over SSC results    Three students committed suicide within three days of the SSC results. SnehalDhuri (18) hung herself at her Vikhroli home because she was forced to forego her seat at K J Somaiya College due to a technicality. The college wanted her school-leaving certificate by 1 p.m.While.....   I couldn't read any further...Most of the time i feel that our education system is so bizzare,the entire fate of the students depend on three hours at the end of the year..three hours that nullify all the 8760 hours of hard work.Why fate..i can say lives of students is decided on how we perform in those three hours..And who decides how much do we get?..A handful of people who value our answer papers..Some troglodytes who dont even bother to read what you want to convey..the people who count the number of supplements you attach and not the number of thoughts that your answers carry.. Such prehistoric is our great education system..And now when i speak to people who are a products of this redundant system..i wonder if they were really intelligent or plain lucky???

      Hurray!!..I am going home..going back to Mumbai..the same road,the same lane,the same compound,the same stairs,the same door and the same face at the door..my mom...I am elated at the very thought of going back to my room..meeting my little brother..eating home made "bengali" food..getting pampered..walking around not having to think what time is college tomorrow,what dinner to have,and depressively looking at the bundle clothes to be washed every sunday...finally i will get a well deserved rest.. But this would not be a relaxing break..the very purpose of being in mumbai is my industrial training..and that has to be completed...  and the best part of being in mumbai..DS..getting to meet him every weekend..wow!!is worth every minute of the grind that i go through in bangalore..  I am in my "dream" mode now.. I am already singing...

      Every evening when i look at the sky,it makes me feel nice, I feel nice thinking that though my loved ones are so far away, They are still looking at the same sky, As if it communicates a silent message to me that... They are well,they are fine, The sky,the moon and the stars have always been my dear friends, From the days as a child,they have helped me, Helped to be a bridge between me and my loved ones, They have safely enveloped all the loving souls , The souls which have left this home and reached that, They through their tiny windows,let my loved ones see me, As if to tell them that though they have left.. I can try and be happy and still smile, But nowdays i miss my dear friends, Suddenly there is this emptiness which surrounds me, But why aren't the clouds leaving ? And why isn't the rain God listening? I still Wonder..??

      &nbsp;Today was quite a day.. Firstly I bunked office and that too without informing them at all. This to me is quite a luxury. Had done that once, when I had been working and had faced the consequences the very next day, I had been summoned by my boss, who had given me an hour’s lecture on being disciplined…. Had endured that. My boss thought that he had truimped..but unfortunately for a person who&nbsp; had endured much longer hours of such lectures lifelong , from school teachers,hostel wardens,elders and ofcourse my parents..this was a cakewalk..Its all about utilizing the 2 ears optimally, as an input and output device. Coming back to this morning..D and I had been to finalize the flat today…In marketing terminology in Mumbai its called the flat with a “mountain view”..hmmm..for a moment it had almost transported me back to my birthplace – Darjeeling..Whatta Mountain View! It’s a view of a hillock next to the complex.. A small green hillock (thanks to the monsoons here)..Far ahead we could see the mist covered hills that surrounds this suburb of Mumbai..But the question was, how long could we, with all the builders already displaying their signboards, it meant that in a couple of years all we would see&nbsp; is concrete..no mist,no greens.. But for two dreamy eyed persons who had braved the downpour and made it to the site..it was “the place”…5 storeys high with&nbsp; bright,airy rooms,lotsa windows,a small cute kitchen,a cuter bathroom,a small but well made living room and a better made bedroom..this was it..their dream destination..what more could the couple from&nbsp; middle class&nbsp; mumbai want..a place to stay in peace..away from the hustle bustle,the Mumbai&nbsp; crowds,the office worries,the deadlines and away from nagging elders …. “Their Home”….580 sq feet of pure contentment.. Already humming…  “Ye Tera Ghar Ye Mera Ghar , Kisi Ko Dekhna Ho GarTo Pehle Aake Maang Le, &nbsp;Meri Nazar Teri Nazar …”

        10 reasons to boot him out of ur life…    1. He claims he'll never, ever cheat on you, but he cheated on his ex in order to be with you.   2. He's always comparing you to an ex.   3. He refuses to show you much attention in public and doesn't invite you to work functions. Next time he asks you to be his date for an important occasion, apologise sweetly and tell him that you have another date that night! 4. He continues to see his ex but "only as friends." They see each other on the same nights as when they were dating, and he refuses to tell the ex that he's dating you now because he doesn't want "to hurt her feelings."   5. He won't introduce you to his friends until you're "on solid ground." But you've been dating him exclusively for six months!   6. He spends more time online doing "research" than with you, but he can never explain what he's researching. Definitely time to push him off the computer and jump online to search for his replacement!  7. He works out at the gym every night and on weekends for its "health benefits" but never builds any muscle… and actually seems to be gaining weight.   8. He breaks up with you when his ex is single — then wants to make up when his ex is involved.   9. He loves to go out with his friends, but every time you suggest a night out, he has "a once in a lifetime" sporting event that he must watch.   10. He loves you when you leave him but needs "more time to himself" when you're together.   Disclaimer:  These reasons are not mine..They have been conceived by a like minded individual.. Well if a girl feels that her guy satisfies all the 10 conditions and still wants to stand by him, then, she is free to do so at her own risk. And if she feels that the reasons are not strong enough to dump a guy, then she is free to add her own & make these reasons more reasonable. If a guy feels that he shouldn’t be dumped on these grounds, he is constitutionally free to voice his opinion… It is not based on any person, living or dead. But if it resembles the character of any individual (living and dead), it is purely co-incidental….

        “My trouble is I analyze life instead of live it.”- Hugh Prather    This kinda describes my life. I not only analyze things, I break my head over the details ... n hence “screw” up my life…So I am gonna to try n live my life & actually “give a shit” about everything else. Well they say “charity begins at home”. I say “everything else begins at home too”..On Saturday had a major argument with my folks at home. The reason.. Hmmm..Apparently there wasn’t any. It had stemmed from a conversation. And it ruined my entire Saturday morning. So finally I promised myself that I would not justify myself to anyone..anyone at all. To be frank I am tired of justifying myself..tired of trying not to hurt people and tired of blaming myself for everything..I was always my own glorified punching bag.. So on Saturday, thought that the best way out was to go n have fun. Coz I didn’t want to crib throughout the day. Met this real good fren of mine after nearly a year. It was just like old times. We chatted for nearly four hours. . Was thrilled to know that he is finally seeing someone.. .. And was serious about her too. Well I am dying to meet this girl, mainly becoz it would take some girl to get him serious…So Vimal ,u still have a good amt of hope.. Well had watched GARV..The movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Well wanted to watch the movie for Salman..But even he couldn’t save it. It’s a criminal wastage of money.. Punnet Issar the director should be banned from torturing the audience in the future. Should have understood from the one star rating that the TOI had given it. I feel its not even worth a rating! Well Shilpa Shetty had ten lines of dialogues and 4-item nos..!!  In the same evening had been to see a flat with D.Well D is buying a flat. A flat for the two of us n that’s going to be my home for the longest part of my life. When I had stepped into the flat, I had felt a surge of joy. Of finally seeing my dreams been given a shape. A definite shape in the form of brick n mortar..  That’s how my Sunday had been spent.. almost dreamily, and maybe the happiness will seep through and will make my entire week a real great one..

      Well i am so happy that gradually i am getting used the "hul chul " of mumbai..Having been in Bangalore for the past year..thought that i wouldn't able to adjust to the fast paced life again..But naah..Im back in form.. Well yesterday had started pretty late(it was around 10 ) when i had left my bed..My boss had been generous to grant m the permission to report to work late..Her Funda- Come anytime u want,but u have to meet the deadline..!..Realised that i had to meet D in Andheri at 11.30..The mad rush began..Andheri is a cool 1hr away from my house,which includes waiting for the BEST bus to the rly station,boarding the train n reachin Andheri station...Managed to board the train (somehow)..it was packed to the hilt..By the time i had managed to settle down,i realised that i had made a BIIIG maistake of wearing a perfectly ironed attire....Well enjoyed the daily dose of a heated argument between 2 commuters..Trust me,if one thing that keeps someone going in a hot,crammed train compartment..its the arguments that erupt between the commuters.. Its very engrossing!!..The best part is that I always learn a new expletive..a very enriching experience..!!By the time i dismounted at Andheri,my attire looked as if they have never been touched by an Iron in their lifetime... Travelled with D to churchgate(the last station on the western route)..gabbled thro the entire journey..had a GOOOD lunch..n then it was time to go to office..Was stuck in the office till 9 at night..After wrapping up the days work,it was time to make my way back ck home..another gruelling 2 hrs journey.!! but that's Mumbai..Dunno whats so good about the city..that no matter how much u work n slog n travel..it still doesn't wear u out.. Have lived in other cities like Kolkata,pune,hyderabad n Bangalore..Trust me,no city can boast of this..Maybe its gotta do with the zeal n the energy that the people in this city live with....its very very contagious!!!  This is an interesting read...all about Amchi Mumbai..   25 Sure signs that you're a Mumbaite.  1. You say town and expect everyone to know that this means south of Churchgate.  2. Youre suspicious of strangers who are actually nice to you.  3. You have never been to the Gateway of India.  4. You dont hear sirens anymore.  5. Hookers, beggars and the homeless are invisible.  6. The trains make sense.  7. Your door has more than three locks.  8. The most frequently used part of your car is the horn.  9. You consider eye contact an act of overt aggression.  10. You call an 8 x 10 clustered room a Hall.  11. You consider beyond Andheri as Upstate.  12. You think Chowpatty & Juhu beaches as nature.  13. Youre paying Rs 10,000 for a 1 room flat, the size of a walk-in closet and you think its a steal.  14. Youve been to New Bombay twice and got hopelessly lost both times.  15. You spend more time each month travelling than you spend at home.  16. You havent heard the sound of true absolute silence since 1977, and when you did, it terrified you.  17. You take fashion seriously.  18. Being truly alone makes you nervous.  19. You have 14 different menus of Free Home Deliveries next to your telephone.  20. Going to town is considered a road trip.  21. You take a taxi to get to your health club to exercise.  22. Your idea of personal space is no one actually standing on your toes.  23. Rs 500 worth of groceries fit in one paper bag.  24. You have a minimum of five worst cab rides ever stories.  25. Youve mentally blocked out all thoughts of the citys air quality and what its doing to your lungs

Now when i stare at the letter that i have received from Bangalore this morning..I feel sorry..feel sorry for my father who had so lovingly given me a name...it proudly said ..Ms Amrutha Roopa Banerjee.. And they say "Whats in a Name?".. I say..A hell lot..

      Like everybody else I was born with a name..my father had given it to me..Amritarupa Banerjee...In an age where Adnan becomes Ady,Sandeep becomes sandy,Tejaswy becomes Teju or Pooja becomes Poo..I had never ever hoped that ppl would address me by my first name..Amritarupa..it was shortened to Amrita..Well i really like the name Amrita..It sounded simple,nice n I was pretty happy about the fact that now people would spell and pronounce it right..Just Amrita..Well it was not to be..When i was in kolkata..I was addressed with that typical Bangla accent which made it sound more like Amrito..So much for being a bengali..After migrating to Pune (well literally coz i had to have my migaration cert. done) the real woes Begun..Earlier the pronunciation was a problem..here my name itself changed..Amruta Banerjee..So that was my first rechristening (1996)...When i had shifted bag n baggage to hyderabad for my grads..i was rechristened for the second time..Amritha Banerjee..Amrutha Banerjee..this generous dosage of "h"does happen down south..Swati becomes swathi,Jyoti becomes Jyothi,Even Natasha (which incidentally is a russian name) is turned into Nathasha.. Now when i stare at the letter that i have received from Bangalore this morning..I feel sorry..feel sorry for my father who had so lovingly given me a name...it proudly said ..Ms Amrutha Roopa Banerjee.. And they say "Whats in a Name?".. I say..A hell lot..

       E- Expected U- Upholders R- Romped O- Out   Well this is the jist of the ongoing EURO-2004.. Well maybe thats why the european championships have been considered to be one roller coaster ride!.I think it definately is.. When nearly half the football lovers thought that France will take the trophy .. And Voila!,they were defeated by a side wheich has never won any international title till date..Call it fate or call it over confidence,anything!!..I didnt mind..coz i had never liked France to begin with.. But after one of my favourites Holland crashed out this morning,I am kinda down..!!Now ,neither will i see nistelroy and his acrobatics nor robben's ball control... :-( But all is not lost ,coz my other favourite Czech Rep is still playin..and playing really well..hopefully tonight they will bulldoze the greeks and later convincingly take the EURO'04 trophy back to prague!! I am sure that Brueckner's eleven can very well do it!!....
