      hey me again, today is going to be so spectacularly boring for the most part. with the two other posts i have written u would probably say my life is really boring. yea some parts can be that way but most of the time(with the exception of this weekend) its exciting. this was just one of those weekends where nothing is happening and all i have to do is a whole lot of nothing! sure i could do my homework or practice a new song on my guitar but homework is boring and i just dont feel like playing right now. today is my cousin Alecia's graduation party, she has a sister samantha and Jeremy. samantha is one of my closest friends, everyone thinks its wierd that we are that close since most cousins hate eachother. so this party, wait cross that out and put get together, should be kinda fun since some of my other cousins are gonna be there. crystal is one of the best cousins a girl could ask for and she can always make me laugh. a sense of humor is the best thing a person can have, i am sooooooo glad i have one and my firends have it to! i swear i cant go a day without laughing maybe i should try, then i probably wouldnt get into to some much trouble at school. my mouth likes to say words that my head doesnt want to say sometimes, i think i should go a total day without talking to anyone, that would actually be really fun in a way. anywho i want to go shopping tomorrow night and get the new New Found Glory cd, i really like the song all down hill from here. well lets cross our fingers and hope that i get to go get it!!! well anyway i should go get ready for that party since it starts in about an hour and a half. tata for now!

      hey its me again, is it bad that i posted twice in one day? well i guess you can say my day has been as boring as watching paint dry. got up @ eight, stayed up a while posted first post and then went to bed and then got up @ around 12. ate dinner went outside and went for a walk and now here i am. tongiht i am afraid to say is most likely going to be the same way unless my friends want to do something which is unlikely since their families have graduation parties to go to while the three i am invited to are tomorrow, the weekend after memorial day, and one is for my dad's side that lives in Kentucky but hell if i am going to go to that, its like a 9 hour drive. 

today my mom and dad went to my grandpa and grandma's house to clean out the garage or something and with my allergies i couldnt go and to tell ya the truth i didnt want to go anyway. does anyone actually like cleaning? so i am here all by myself, unless you count my dog, Midnight(i know original name but give me a break, i was eight when i got him!!) 

i was just thinkin about the show on the WB called like the wb superstar or whatever and they have these people audition for this like american idol and they look for the worst singers out there and sometimes i wonder how these people can think they're good singers. i am not trying to be mean or anything its just some of them really suck! i dont know maybe i just dont know a good voice when i hear one?!

well i am going to try to find something to make this day a little less boring~ tata for now

my life is a mix of fun, boringness, and excitement. right now me and my best friend jennifer are in this big fight with our used to be best friend who wants to be popular. me and jennifer were not losers by anymeans but were not like the preppy girls that we secretly cant stand. who wants to be perfect all the time, not me. i dont realy know how this childish stupid fight started, its so dumb! i hate that she cant just talk things out and actually act her age. i never thought stef would be that way but whatever! its her bad a$$ mistake that caused it! obviously we werent best friends if she wants to throw it all away, i mean c'mon! is it really that wrong for me not to care? i mean she always was annoying but i really thought i knew her. when you grow up do you grow out of your friends? 

Anyway off of that stupid a$$ so lets talk about my summer plans:
ok so school gets out in 5 days! ROCK ON! so the week after school me and jennifer are gonna hang out @ eachother's houses and then the weekend after is my sister Shelley's wedding...the receptions going to be a blast because of the whole family being there. one thing u have to understand is that my mom's side of the family is crazy, cool, and lots of fun! it's always a great time when all of us get together!my mom has 5 other brothers and sisters so i have a lot of cousins and aunts and uncles. so back to the wedding, i really dont like mathew as much as kelly, my sisters ex-husband, he was so much like family to me and i'll never forget him. my brother james (also known as jimmy) lives in kansas city, Kansas and he's coming back for the big wedding and when they(meaning his fiance Terri and his sons andrew and james jr.) leave i get to go with them and stay in Kansas for 5 weeks! i have stayed a while down there each summer but 5 weeks is the longest i will have ever stayed! i like what a big city has to offer, i've never liked the tiny town i live in because its so boring and everyone here is so typical and they gossip all the time about others in the town. i just think i want somewhere where a lot of people dont know me because here i am afraid i am going to mess up and have the whole f*cking town talking about me. maybe i care too much about what everyone thinks but my parents are really well known around here and i just hate that. if i lived in a different huge city that would solve a lot of my problems.

after i get back from kansas my mom's side goes camping almost every weekend. its not the boring kind of camping, its fun like we play volleyball, go on nature trails, and bike and basically keep active until the sun goes down. then its time to sit around the fire, relax, and have tons of laughs!

the rest of my summer continues with the Monticello fair and hanging out with jennifer and other friends. the monticello fair is an awesome place, its the second best fair in Iowa, second only to the State Fair. they have tons of concerts and rides, its soo fun and lasts a week.

well i guess i will type more later! cya
