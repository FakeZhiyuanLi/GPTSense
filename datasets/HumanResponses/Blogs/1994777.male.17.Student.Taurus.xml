      just got bac from my trip to malaysia this afternoon.i would say it was a rather productive meet.3 PB's.not too bad considering i have not been tapered for this competition.missed the 800m ecord by 3 seconds and the 1500m one by 2.i don't really know if i should be disappionted or happy.afterall i did cut down my best time in the 1500m by close to 20seconds.john was rather pleased with my swim.damn.i shouldn't have stop at the 800m mark to look at my time.probably would have gone faster if i hadn't done that.but anyway.i will break it in august during the grand prix.i will.did an ok result for the rest of the events.got DQ for 200m fly!shit man.or else i could have got the gold.was jerking on the starting block.haha.too nervous i guess.i think mark tan is rather pissed off with his swim and with me cos i kept on poking fun at him.but we're cool.we had lots of fun in our room!haha.tissue paper?a few of us were actually throwing tissue paper bombs from the 19th floor all the way down to the swimming pool.haha.it was really cheeky but we had hell alot of fun.uncle david and john were the coaches for our team.it's my first meet with uncle david and i gotta say he's really a great guy to work with.he's really dedicated into coaching and always trys his best to give us swimmers advise and motivate us.i really enjoyed working with him at this meet.oh.and he was from BYU too!now isn't that interesting?=)mark went off a day earlier so i had the whole room to myself for like 2 nights?it's funny how neat the room turned out after he left.haha.made a couple of new friends there.malaysians and some guys from hong kong.was thinking of her the whole time in malaysia.really glad i'm back now.=)nic was good company when i was feeling lonely on the bus and during the course of the trip.haha.he's a really nice guy.no wonder there's so many girls after him.its hilarious playing pool with him.haha.all off us couldn't stop laughing at the way he plays.bought alot of dvds back to singapore so that i can watch till my eyes pop out.damn lucky i didn't get caught at the immigration.so i guess that'a really all about the trip.on the whole.i think it was a productive one and i can't complain considering i did a few PB's and came close to the national records.   for you i bleed myself dry...

      today's a day of rather mixed feeling.ok.i'm somewhat pissed off with my performance in the pool yesterday afternoon and today morning.cos i couldn't hold a good time yesterday and this morning i just floated around in the pool.it was simple horrible.i was so pissed of with myself for not being able to complete the damn set.gotta try to hang in there the next time round.so anyway.yesterday's afternoon session was not up to my expectations.don't wanna talk about it man.i let myself down.this morning's was worst.i did a 3min for 200fly!!total crap. but the day wasn't all that bad.the thought of spending the rest of the day with HER lifted my spirits.went for lunch at coffee club than we watched harry potter.it wan't a bad movie but neither was it great.but who cares anyway.as long as i'm with her.any movie seems good.so after the show we walked around and had coffee before MEL WONG came.she's my little sis(or so it seems).we went to evan's birthday party together.me and mel.not HER.sigh.no offence to you mel.you're a great companion.so anyway.there were so many people that i didn't know at the party.my ex was there.it was kind of weird.we were avoiding each other.i guess it just feels funny to actully start a conversation with someone whom you were so close to but is a stranger to you now.i mean.its just weird.so anyway.it wasn't so bad.had a good long informative talk with michael boon.he's from ri too.used to be very close but drifted apart and fate has reunited us in the form of evan's party.its nice to see him after so long and my has he changed.for better or worst is hard to say.i guess mike's a really nice person who i really enjoy talking to.although he might seem like a bad influence now and stuff but i know deep down inside him he really is a person who is concerned about other people's feelings and stuff.we had a really nice chat a it brought back memories of secondary school days.how we used to party together and break the school rules and girls and a whole lot of other crappy stuff that only we would find amusing.dong liang.jeremy.and a whole lots of should i say 'retired' swimmers were there at the party too.its was really fun.sort of like a gathering of long lost friends.right.long lost sounds a bit to much.haha.but yeah.something like that.man i had loads of chicken wings and im not sure if the were cooked properly or not.haha.oh.cheng xun was also there.obvious.him being evan's sweetheart.i think they really make such a loving couple.they've been together for like a few years i would say?cheng xun is really sweet to her and all.man.i don'd mind him being my girlfriend!haha to bad he's a guy.so mel came home with me after the party cos he parents were coming to my place to pick her up.we watch a last parts of the ring on hbo and freaked out.haha.i guess i won't be getting much a sleep tonight. so i would say that today was not too bad except for the swimming bit.but like i said.i really did enjoy the time i spent with HER.i've only got a couple of months left and i really don't want to waste it on other stuff...   i can't promise nothing will happen to me. i can't promise i'll be the man of your dreams. i can't even promise that i wouldn't change. but what i can promise you. is that as long as this heart of mine still beats. as long as im still breathing. i will never stop loving you...

      oh man!lakers lost the nba championship.damn.but give credit to detroit.they were excellent on the offence today.i think the era of the lakers domination is coming to an end.but not to worry.i think they'll get better players next season.i really hope they get t-mac!haha.kobe-shaq-tmac.hmmm.unbeatable don't you think so?so anyway.today was like all the other day.just the usual swimming and sleeping.nothing really interesting happened.mark chay's back in singapore.saw him doing a couple of laps in tao payoh.he told me that he and gary are going to train at ssc with joscelin and ben gan.thats good to hear.unice and me talked alot during training today.talked about school and stuff.at least i get to know more about american culture before i actually go there.so i'm going to this place called provo in utah.they're a mormon state and so there no smoking.drinking and lots more stuff.haha.no pubs.no clubs.so not much of an exciting place as you can see.but no worries.there lots of other activities like snow boarding and stuff.pretty cool.oh and its high altitude.like 3 or 4 thousand meters abouve sea level.so training at such heights is said to improve you stamina and all that crap.i've yet to experience that.me and unice are planning to join a club there cos our school doesn't have a 50m long course pool.they only have a 25yard one.not much training you can get out of a 25yard pool.haha.today's training was not too bad.was doing to much butterfly that my legs cramped up.painful man!yeah.but i completed the set fairly well.not as good as i wished.but nevertheless.still within acceptable range.haha.i really got to get my bloody fitness up for malaysian open.i'm only left with what?a week?yeah.john hinted that there would be shopping after we completed the meet!haha.i'm a bit sick of shopping but heck i'll just go anyway.i hope i'll do a well for the competition.i'm actually aiming for the 800m freestyle national record.should be able to break it if all goes well.its not hard but it ain't easy as well. mark tan is still heart broken.awww.don't be.i don't know what to say to him to get him to cheer up.haha.did i mention mark taught me alot oh shit in vietnam?right mark?he taught me how to chase girls and stuff.ironically hes now in a situation like this?!haha.don't worry so much man.you hear from her soon i guess.=)   Cos when I look at my life How the pieces fall into place It just wouldn't rhyme without you When I see how my path Seem to end up before your face The state of my heart The place where we are Was written in the stars...

      today i was 'interviewed' in csc.it was quite lame but at least the young one had a good time.didn't really know what to tell them.had lunch with marcus and weiren.eh you 2 didn't even talk much la!let me do all the talking.damn embarrassing.but oh well.so i was asked how life was in the COE.and my reply was simple.it's FUN.haha.yeah i guess the coe is fun if you go to every training session with a positive mindset and do your best in training to get the best out of it.training can be both challenging and fun at the same time.the coe is not dead serious in everything we do.we joke with john during training but when it come to serious training sets we are serious about it and try our very best to complete them with the best of effort.that way.we'll be satisfied with the set we accomplish.so i was ask about the olmpic trials too and how i miss by .4 sec in the 100m fly.yeah well.i guess thats life for you man.gotta just put the past behind and carry on training hard to achive what i want to in swimming.sometimes however.i wonder how long i can sustain these hard sessions of training.at the back of my head.i know that one day i'll not be able to continue any longer.i dread for that day to come.probably when i'm 25?or 26?i don't know.i just hope i can carry on swimming as long as possible.but i guess there's more to life than just swimming.we cant just live on swimming.one day it'll be my time to hang my trunks up and call it a day.i just wish to get the best out of swimming for the time i have.to be able to tell my children and their children that i was once a good or even better a great swimmer.thats what i really want out of swimming.so thats that about what happened in csc. training was fine today.was not feeling quite as good as i wish to be in the water but its probably because of the holiday.mark tan has been complaining about he and his shitty performance in vietnam and about his crush on she-who-shall-not-be-named.haha.you're getting on my nerves damnit.aiyah.just carry on with life man.you'll get over it somehow.i meant the swimming.not the girl.the girl can wait.haha!=)right.so this guy called mark tan is going to be my room mate in malaysia.what can i say?lucky you?haha.just joking.i'm sure we'll have hell alot of fun huh?so anyway.mediacorp were shooting in toapayoh today.i was supposed to be down for filming too but due to the 'interview' in csc i was not able to make it.haha!and bing had to take my place in the end.i'm very sorry for the inconvenience.haha.but bing.i must say u look pretty good in the cap and that shocking green goggles.haha! went back to RI (raffles instituion) after training to prep talk to the swimmers there.played a bit of basketball before that.i was chased out of the court by the damn guard!and he said i was 'yaya'?what an ass.i didn't stay on to play the war games cos i was seriously tired and all.the swimmers in ri lack confidence in themselves.i could tell from their faces when i asked them about their chances of retaining the title our batch won from acsi.i'll always remeber that moment when we made history.such emotion.such determination from the team.it was really a moment of glory for the swim team.this year's team didn't have that flare and burst which our batch had that led us to victory.i really feel that they should stand up to the challenge however hard or impossible it might seem.we seniors really do believe in you guys.doesn't matter what the outcome is.as long as you guys have all tired your best and give it everything you've got.we will all be proud of you.so all i want to say to you guys is just to believe in yourself like what marcus has told you.trust you training and your ability to overcome the odds.search deeper within yourself and you'll find that you guys and just loaded with potential waiting to be nutured.develop them and it'll lead you to heights beyound your wildest dreams.so all the best for the upcoming school nationals and i hope you guys achive you goals and what you set out to do.=) been smsing her the whole day today=)shes really sweet to talk to.oh well.thats all for today i guess.   Two very different people Too scared to get along Till two hearts beat together Underneath one sun One very special moment Can turn a destiny And what some would say Could never change Has changed for you and me...

      greetings everyone!i'm back from my holiday.haha.it was great to finally get a break after all the swimming and i really enjoyed the time i spent with my family.these will probably be the last time i get to spend such quality time with them before i leave for the US of A.anyway.the trip was good.the shopping was even better!haha.mark tan please drop by to collect your t-shirts.right i just landed not long ago and i'm seriously tired.funny though i don't really feel like sleeping.there ist't much to do in thailand except shop all day long i guess?althought i did swim every morning when i was there and i'm quite proud of it!watch the lakers versus pistions game this morning.lakers lost and are trailing 3-1 in the finals.i really hope they can pull through and win this one.i've been doing alot of thinking in bangkok and realised that i've actually endured whatever shit life had hit me with for 17 years already!haha.so anyway.its already been 17 years in this world but come to think of it.it was only the last say 4 years that was should i say more interesting?it was the time i got into the most trouble but also the time where i made many true friends.well.i've gotta say that i've made many mistakes in life.some were more serious than others but never the less they were still mistakes.i've probably made every damn mistake a 17 year old can ever make.but i guess i've learn from them and come out a better person.i've been scolded.beaten.humiliated and probably the only punishment that has not happened to me is to get thrown into prison!and mind you i don't intend to let them happen.i believe that after all these years of ups and downs i has made me a stronger person as well.maybe thats where i get all my determintation and will from.i'm greatful for all the poeple who help me along the way to get back on track to find the right path in life.their guidence was exactly what i needed in time of crisis.there're just to many people i wanna thank at this point of time.i'm sure you know who you are.so all i want to say to those who feel like its the end of the world for them.don't give up hope.cos there alot of people out there who wish to see you well.don't ever give up on yourself for once that happens all hope is lost.=)having said this.i realised that i'm really lucky.at least i have all the things a teenager could ask for.some other people in other parts of the world ain't as fortunate as me.i'm really lucky to have friends and family around me that wish to see me well.altough we all know that there also people who love to see us fall.the simple fact that you have these friends and family around you warms our soul and give us strength to carry on living life to the fullest.theres also the good part of life which i share with my closest friends and family.i really cherish the time i've spent with them.firends like pok.haha.your the best brother i'll ever have man!i still remember we get into hell alot of trouble together.but we also spent the best days in school together=)mark tan.my swim mate who i love to talk shit to.these will be the moments i'll remember. i watched 50 first dates on the plane alotught i've watch it before.it's such a romantic comedy.i really love it.its great to be in love don't you think so?=)altough it might hurt you in the later stages of a realtionship when the flame dies out.but never the less.to love and be loved in return is something everyone wants.i'm really reluctant to leave her behind when i leave for the US of A.but i guess that's life right?gotta learn to let go when the time comes.i've made a promise that i'll come back for her.=)and i intend to keep it that way.how does one know if a girl or guy is the right one for them?i though my previous girl was the right one for me but it didn't work out.haha!so people who are reading this blog please post your comments!anyway.these things are really unpredictable.i've known of couples who always seems to be quarreling but they still make it.somehow.haha!so thats that about this funny thing call love.=)   I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow I watched the stars crash in the sea If i could ask god just one question Why aren't you here with me?

      -to train ur body to the limit.till your lips turn blue.legs start trembling and arms go numb.that my friend is the best feeling in the world-  training today was tough.but i completed a good set and was pleased with myself.30 by 100m freestyle was painful.but i loved it.this thing about pain is overwhealming me.it's starting to become a drug that i have to live on.i'm probably addicted to it right now.haha!strange don't you think so?coach john said something during training today that had me ponder over the entire training session.he said: i've never come across a 1500m swimmer who doesn't like pain.i was thinking about it the whole time and relised that what he said was so true.we swimmers get alot of time to think of stuff when we swim.especially during sets like 30 by 100m.helps keep us occupied in the water.haha.yeah so back to the question.pain.most swimmers would hate it.but we 1500m swimmers just thrive on it.pain has already become a daily neccessity when we train.i guess we just like to push ourselves to the limit.to see how much our bodies can endure.how do you explain it.lets see.it sort of feelis like you've been punched in the stomach real hard?yeah something like that.and you feel totally breathless.on top of that.your mucles start hardening and you feel like you could take eternity to reach the wall.so thats that for training today. i'll be leaving for thailand tomorrow!and because of this i'm now the number 1 hate figure in the COE (Centre of Excellence).haha!don't worry guys.i'll send you lots of postcards =P so anyway.like i said.i deserved this holiday.its amazing how time actually flys.come to think of it.it was as if it were only yesterday that i was in the examination hall taking my 'o' levels.haha.i'm really glad it's all over now by the way.i'm soon going to start a new chapter in my life when i go to the US to study as well as train for my swimming.i'm really excited about the idea of going overseas.i believe it'll be a worthwhile experience.altough i'm rather reluctant to leave HER behing.*sigh*.oh well.i'll just let fate take over.shall cherish the few months i'm left with.i'll really miss my friends too.mark tan i hope you're reading this.i'm reffering to you.and POK.and a whole lot more.oh.unice is going to BYU (Brigham Young University) too.and guess what!she'll most probably be taking the same course as me!haha.cool isn't it?unice is BIG.right.i shall not comment further in fear of getting whacked.but anyway.unice is training at the COE with us right now.she's sort of struggling i think.but don't worry so much girl.you'll get over it in a couple of weeks time. csc (chinese swimming club) invited me to talk to the A and B groups about life in COE.haha.that should be interesting.haha.oh!i've got to say this.the parents in csc are totally screwed man!not all but a few.its sad that because of these few people the name of csc is being tarnish.yeah.i'm not gonna lie about it.all they do is try to bring you down when you're good.but i've got my ways of shutting them up.so to all you parents who wish to see my downfall.i know who you people are.i'll make sure you idiots won't get a chance at all.=).i don't know why they love to do such things.maybe because they think i'm arrogant?right.let me say this.every swimmer has a big ego.i'm serious.if you don't have a big ego you'll never be able to make it big.i've got a big ego.i don't hide that.but i'm not arrogant.you really don't have to be arrogant to have a big ego.its because of our super huge ego that make good swimmers great.i'm not saying i'm great but i'm trying to get this message across that it's all right to have a big ego.i mean.thats what drive us or should i say me to excell further.if you're just plain jealous of people's achievments which many parents are (especially in csc).than all i have to say is: i've worked hard to be where i am today.i'm not the best yet.but believe me when i say this.i'll be SOMEONE one day.we guys in the COE have a motto in which all of us follow.its a simple saying that goes like this: the only place where success come before work is in the dictionary.so we work hard to get to where we are today.COE has produced results where no other clubs have.its because of the simple reason that we are all hard workers who follow the coach's instruction.we don't slack during training.i can confidently say that our squad is by far the most disciplined.most professional.and most outstanding squad in the whole of singapore.i would rather train with these guys than any other squad of hundreds who do not take swimming seriously.having said this.i want to add on that i still love csc.the club which nutured me to what i am today.but i guess the policy of this thing about parents interfering with swimmers should be changed for the good of swimming.mind you some of the parents are really nice to me like aunt doreen and mark's mum.so thats all i guess about the indifference i have with certain parents.haha=)anyway.will be blogging only when i return from my holiday!feel free to add comments.cheers!   If I die tonight, I'd go with no regrets If it's in your arms I know that I was blessed And if your eyes are the last Thing that I see Then I know the beauty heaven Holds for me  But if I make it through, if I live to See the day If I'm with you, I'll know just what to say The truth be told, girl you take my Breath away Every minute, every hour, every day

      today's the first serious training session since i got back from vietnam.one word to discribe my performance today.TERRIBLE.haha.yeah.it was quite a horrible training session.was struggling to keep myself afloat.haha!oh well.has to be the fatige from travelling and all.bumped into fiona today at tao payoh.she was shooting and i must say she really look good in her skimpy outfit.haha.i shall not comment futher.the day didn't start out as good as i expected.i actually set my alarm clock for 8.30am this morning but i ended up waking up at 12 noon!probably too tired to hear it go off.cost me my live game of lakers versus pistons for game 2 of the nba fianls.but i got to watch the last 18 seconds of the game LIVE.haha!lakers won by the way.which means the series is tied at 1-1 but pistions now have home court advantage after winning game one.really hope the lakers can win it this season.right.enough of basketball.question for those who read this post: say you really like a person but you know you can only spend very little quality time with him or her before it all ends.what will you do?will you spend that little time with him or her or will you just let this oppotunity slip by so as not to hurt the other party's feelings?please post your comments :) mark tan.if  you're reading this.i want you to know that you've been a great moral booster in vietnam.thanks for cheering me on and encouraging me when i needed it most.to all those that help me along the way too.a big thank you.i'm really fortunate to have friends like you guys.marcus cong ben mel nat sandy lynette and alot more.thank you once again guys.i'll be leaving for thailand this friday for a holiday!and i'm not ashame to say this: i deserve this holiday!the simple reason being that i've been training my a** off since the start of the year and i really think a holiday would help.haha.guess i'll just laze around the pool.we swimmers don't get to laze around the pool too often.haha! miss heng my chinese teacher when i was back in raffles instituion is getting married soon!congrats congrats.really wish i could attend the wedding but i won't be in singapore due to competition.sorry.oh well.tha's all for today i guess.  *she is the girl.and i really want to make her mine.*

      i'm back from a week long journey to vietnam.i'm tired.sleepy.and its 3.01pm now.just reached home from the airport and i'm heading to the pool soon for training.vietnam i would say was an eye opener and a great experience as well.firstly.the competition.it wasn't so bad considering i'm not tapered.3golds 2 slivers and a bronze was enough for the best performer for the 15-17 age group award.i wasn't too happy with the results though.didn't hit any personal best times and i lost both the 50m and 100m freestyle events to lubert.he's a great competitor by the way and i got to say he was the better swimmer.but i can't complain.john was pleased with my performance there in vietnam.the people there were cool.the swimmers from thailand and phillipines were exceptionally friendly.competition was rather tight and the BP award went right down the line between me and suriya.he's a thai swimmer and hell of a good one too.he made it to the sea games last year.made lots of new friends there.pool wasn't too bad except that we didn't have touch pads and so had to do with 3 hand timers in each lane.got scolded by larry our team manager on the second day of the trip cos i over slept.haha.but all else are cool between us now.during the week our daily meals were more junk food like instant noodles rather than proper food.movies were screened in joel's room every afternoon and night for free!haha.we had lots of fun in danang.the place where our competition was held.the weather was fine.food not too bad.ended up as cong's room mate for the second year running and we're probably THE roommates!cheers bro.keep up ur excellent performance.between us.we won a total of 5golds 3 silvers and 3 bronze i think.probably the most in any single room.haha.oh well.so that's about that for the competition. now for the next part.culture.the first impression of vietnam i had when i first stepped into the airport was that the country was sort of a 3rd world country.probably because of the vietnam war not too long ago.this was sort of a cultural shock from my point of view.danang the city we had our competition in was like a wasteland.not exactly that bad but enough for one to not want to spend his life there.bulidings didn't go above 10stories or so.slumps littered the vast landscape like an epidemic.there was totally no organisation in the city at all.the people there were sort of deprived.what i mean is that they do have the basic needs but only minimal.the led simple lives and the standard of living was low.it really made me stop to think of how fortunate we singaporeans really are.somtimes we don't see the really down side of life as we're born with a silver spoon in our mouths.the people there were poor and they didn't ask for much.just a roof above their heads and 3 meals a day are enought to make them contented.so that's a vague view of what danang is like.we went to ho chin min city on the last 2 days of the whole trip.its was better off there with hotels and shopping centers.but still not comparable with singapore.

      in about 3 hours and 45 minutes time.i'll be in the airport waiting to fly off to vietnam.just came back from morning trianing.did 1.5km only!*burning cd's for lynette now*somehow,i don't really know why,i can't wait to go to vietname to race.it's been a while since i last race.about a month i would say?i use to hate racing when i was younger.probably the fear of losing?or not doing well?but it has all change since the start of the year ever since the arrival of john.john's my coach by the way.and a hell of a good one too.it was him who led me to 3 under-17 national records in a single meet.therefore,i would say that much credit must go to him.*thanks johnny boy*haha.yeah.so anyway.i guess racing is a form of escape for me from the real world.be it that 20 or so seconds for a 50m race.all i know is that during that time.i am free from the rest of reality.for that time.i'm in total control of what happens in the pool.i don't know how many of my swim mates have this same feeling but this is what i feel when i am racing.one thing i really love during these races is the way my body feels.the feeling of the last 50m of a 200m race.haha.yeah.many of the swimmers will think i'm crazy but this is what i live for!it just gives you a sense of satisfaction in that you know that you've pushed your body to the limit.this feeling of extreme fatigue and pain is really what keeps me going.it makes me know that i'm ALIVE.

      today's exactly a month after me and nat got together.time really flys.seems only yesterday that i got to know her.actually i've known nat for slightly over a year now.altought we only got together a month ago.i feel really lucky to have her in my life.about another 3 more weeks before i leave and as the days draw nearer my heart grows heavier.we've known each other for such a short peroid of time but yet we're both serious about this relationship.hmmm.love at first sight?oh well. i'm into the last phrase of my preperation now.competition starts on monday but my first event will only be on tuesday.that's good in a sense that i can get one extra day of taper and rest.the 1500m freestyle is on thursday and there's a field of very good swimmers that i'll be competing against.but i believe that among all of them i am the best.and i know what i have to do to win.every swimmer has to learn his race.not what the others are doing.i think i know my race better than any of my competitiors know theirs.that's why i swim fast.when they learn that.they'll be better swimmers.not that they are not good now.i live and die by my technique.i guess when i get my swim right.that national recrod will be mine.this damn sore throat is still bothering me thought.it's getting really annoying at times.just have to deal with it.hope it disappears by the next couple of days.   pleased to beat you.

      a week to go before my assualt on the race.its time to see if i've got balls of steel or marshmellows according to john.one thing that's worrying me however is the absence of john during my swim.he has to go for the olympics.i've always seen john as an inspirational figure ever since he started coaching me at the start of the year.his mere presence helps me to push myself during races.i'll just have to do without him for this race then.get myself metally prepared for it.i've been feeling rather shitty of late.have a bad sore throat and its developing into a nasty cough.i really hope i goes away soon as it seems to be somewhat affecting my swims.then again.i should not let a small thing like this get in the way of my preperation.all the work is done.it's all up to me now on how i'm going to tackle this swim.no use worrying so much on it now it'll only make thing worst.nat's 200m free is on the same day as my 1500m.that's comforting in a way.knowing that the person you love will be behind you.oh well.hope all goes as planned.   your love has no missing parts... its everything my heart desires...

      finally.hell week has come to an end.but not before we did a real hard set yesterday morning.12 by 400m freestyle.not the type of stuff you would wanna do at 5.30 in the morning.oh well.it was the last session so i gave it every ounce of enery left in me to complete it.and my was i suprised when i did a resonably good timing for all of them.considering i'm alomst dead from the pervious days workouts.so anyway.everyting's looks set and i feel ready for racing.i slept the whole morning after training and only woke up for lunch than went back into sleeping.haha.woke up at around 6pm to get ready for the swimshady's concert.the thing was held at phuture(zouk).not to bad i must say.in fact i thought that it was really good considering the band's profession is in swimming and not singing.so after the concert.me mark and jed went for diner and then returned to zouk for a a few drinks with amanda and yaqi.zouk's rather quite lately.think people are starting to get tired of clubbing already.haha.   your love made me make it through...

      went for supper with mark and uncle leong after dinner today.uncle leong picked me up and we had to wait at the coffe shop for the stupid mark tan to turn up cos his training only ends at 8.but anyway.we were discussing alot of stuff about swimming before mark came.one thing we both agreed on was the lack of young swimmers going into the longer distance events.most swimmers nowadays are only interesteed in the 50m races.ask theem to swim a 100m race and thy start complaining.this isn't a comforting situation.the fact that they are only training sprits while at this young age suggest that they won't go far in the later stages of their swimming career.talk about aports school and how it was a flop.haha.i wouldn't comment too much on this issue of the sports school as i have friends studying and training there.but all i can say is that rights now.the best place to train for those who are serious in thier swimming is the COE.and that's where i train.so mark tan came finally and we went to pizza hut to eat.very heavy supper i must say.pizza.we talk about cars as that's the only damn thing mark is interested in.oh right.and he told us all these racist jokes over ice cream after pizza.it's good to have a bite with uncle leong after his long absence.he's one hell of a joker and a terribly nice fella too.so anyway.he got married last year already.so i guess he's having to look at life in a different perspective now that he's married.no more late nights and playing around with girls!haha.but this thing about marraige is funny.all i can say is that if 2 peple really love each other tan what is marraige?it's only merely a piece of paper.that's all.love.sigh.oh well.i wish him all the best in the later part of his life and hope it goes well for him.10 days to go to the big day.i'm feeling stronger and stronger in the water as each training sessions progresses.going into a taper soon and i hope i'll feel like a million bucks when the time comes.   the only way to success is to be proud.skillful.tenacious.

      training was hell as usual.it's only tuesday and i'm at the brink of breaking down.my legs were wobbling after this evening's training.good thing i have the morning off tomorrow or else i'm just gonna drop dead.went to school today and went home after the first lesson.haha.to tired to stay in school and listen to boring lessons.the AIS personall gave us a talk on swimming and other stuff.i found it quite informative and i must say what they actually say is rather true about all singaporean swimmers.is swimming an individual sport?some might claim so.but as i reflect on the people who dedicate their time and effort into making us swimmers what we are today.i can't help but wonder if others thought the same way too.coaches who dedicate the entire lives to coach swimmers to become champions.who pass on thier knowledge on the vast sbject of swimming.parents who tirelessly support the swimmer.be it moral support or physically fetching them to and fro to thier respective training ground.fellow swimates who push each other along the way to help us improve.now back to the question.is swimming an individual sport?well you decided.singaporean swimmers on the whole are rather self-centered.they think about themselves?everything they do or train for is for the sole purpose of gettting what they want out of swimming.now looking at the big picture.i find that we swimmers should not be swimming just for ourselves.instead we should be looking at swimming as a team.team singapore.this was what we discussed in the talk.by pushing each other during training and encouraging each other to hang in there when training becomes hell.that's the way we should train.and that's how we can improve our times as well.the rest is how hard you're willing to push your body.i love to push my body to the limit.to take that step out of my comfort zone.my current goal is to break the national record for the 800m and 1500m freestyle.something which i thought wasnt acheivable a few months back.but the will to excel.the hunger for glory.pushed me along the way.to know that you've got a goal to achive give you a purpose to train like i do.if not.trianing would be nothing more than just hurting your body without a reason.that's stupid.having said this.i must add that i wouldn't be so close in achiving whaat i set out to do without the help of my swimates and coaches.my coach john especially who instilled the prospect of breaking the record in me and always believing that i was able to do it.my swimates mainly cong and bing who push and encourage me during every single training session.i wouldn't be this close without the help of them and i'm truly thankful.so anyway.its less than a fortnight till grand prix.we'll see what i can do then.   only those who dare to strive lift themselves above horizons...

      training was a killer today.8km in the morning and 6.5 in the afternoon.someone please help me!oh well.as i said.this week's gonna be hell so i sort of expected it to be this tough.although what i thought was a gradual build up of intensity as the week progresses.it's only monday and i'm feeling the fatigue setting in on me.haha.oh.the AIS (Australian Institute of Sports) olympic swim team came down for training at the tao payoh pool.it's rather cool.we trained along them in the afternoon.to actually be able to train in the same pool with the likes of patriea thomas, craig stevens and justin norris is a great honor for me.craig stevens is off course the guy who gave up his 400m freestyle qualification at the australian olympic trials to let ian thorpe swim in the event.he qulified for the 15hundred though so its all right.john told me that these guys train really hard and LOVE hurting themselves during training.what he meant by hurting is that they train till the maximum limit their bodies can take.i really respect them for that.so anyway.it's a little less than 2 week to grand prix.can't wait. went to orchard with mark tan yesterday.bought a computer for my mum.had dessert with mark at NYDC.then we went to taka to shop for clothes.haha.bought a pair of jeans there.we met leonard unice and cong at taka.apparently they wee going to support gary and his band as they were performing there for charity.i think gary's band is rather cool.all swimmers except the drummer - tony.he's also the composer of all their songs i guess.will be going for their mini concert at zouk this saturday.it should be quite good and i must say gary can really sing quite well.haha.so after we watched them perform i went to meet my parents at some chinese resturant.food was good. i really miss nat.it's been a long time since i last saw her.gotta wait till grand prix till i see her again.sigh.oh well.absence makes the heart fonder.   i'm here without you baby but you're still on my lonely mind... i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time...

      just came back from breakfast.didn't train today cos we did exercises in the gym.and cos it was raining like hell.ah fai has left for canada already.sigh.everyone's leaving.soon there'll be no one left in singapore.having some problems recently.oh well.don't really want to talk about it.so i guess i'll just keep it inside me for a while first.mum got back from her hong kong trip last night!she'd didn't get me anything!but it's all right.we're going to stop by LA bfore i start school to get me some stuff there.i think my dad is really going to be pissed off when the card bill comes later this month.i've spent more than i'm supposed to in less than a week.haha.gotta learn to control man or i'm gonna just spend every cent in his account.grand prix 2 is so near.i'm getting more and more nervous as the day come closer.john's been putting alot of pressure on me to break the damn record.but it's good in a way.at least i won't slack off too early in my training phrase.damn.it's exactly 31 days before i leave.that's fast.suddenly i realise that i've got so many things to do before i leave.so many thing to tell my family.friends.nat.sigh.too much on my mind.somehow i'm not really doing much about anything.lazy?probably.i'm feeling rather shitty of late.my stomach keeps cramping.hmmm.what could that mean?haha.i went to school yesterday!but i went home halfway cos i was too tired from training.   god must have spent a little more time on you...

      what can i say man.we lost to acjc for the 4 by 50m freestyle relay.and i'm not please with that.sigh.but i guess the better team won that day and as galant losers.i have to take my hat down to the acjc team for humbling us.letting us know that we are still BEATABLE.although i really hate to say it.but anyway.it was a good meet.didn;t get the result i was hoping for but i can't complain.i've tried my best and thats all that matters.RJC won both the overall titles thought.and that was what we came out to do.training's gonna be hell when we get back into our training phrase.the fact that i could still clock pretty good times without a taper would suggest that i'm on the right track in my praperation for grand prix 2.i am and will make a bang in that meet.just wait and see...

      i'm bored.damn.school ntional's a horror.i haven't been breaking any record and all the younger ones are coming up fast.but i can't complain la.just swimming through the stupid meet.no training for the rest of the week!yay!cos i completed 10 sessions already.unlike bing.i get to rest today afternoon.sorry dude.i'll be lying on my bed while you're training your ass off.haha!i'm mean.this week's trainig was quite shitty in a sense that it's only my 2nd week doing the long distance sets.i didn't do too badly though.but no gym for the whole week!that probably explains why my sprinting is not improving of late.oh well.it's good training i must say.the 1500m and 800m record is in sight.i'm desparate to break it.for those who don't know what a day's training for us swimmers is.let me give you some information on our training:  morning training starts at 5.30am  set:      400m freestyle (6:00)            12 by 50m free (0:45)            6 by 500m freestlye (5:50)            20 by 50m kick with drag suit (1:15)            4 by 50m sprints (1:00)  evening sessions starts at 4.30pm  set:      20 by 50m butterfly (0:50)             4 by 100m freestyle (1:30)             6 by 50m sprints (1:00)             300m drills             30 by 100m holding 1:04 every 100 (1:40)             20 by 50m pulling (0:45)  so there you go.that's our normal sets for a normal day at training.not exactly the kind of stuff that you would want to do after a competition thought.haha.in a day we'll usually complete 12.5 to 13km i would say?yeah.it's not something we be looing forawrd to doing.but training like these pays off.knowing the inprovment you'll get out of this give you the will to carry on training day in day out.haha=) so anyway.next week is the finals for school nationals.last chance to break the records.one last shot at glory!

      i went out with nat today for lunch and a movie.and i was really happy that we could spend some time alone.without having to worry about whats happening around us.however it didnt seems like any normals times we spent together.knowing that this would probably be my last time i'll be seeing her face to face.it was really a time of mixed feelings.im truly hapy to be spending the time im left with her but deep down i must face the reality that i'll be leaving her soon.leaving her to go to the states.and these thoughts just made me sad.its been a little over a month since we started this relationship and having to get separated really hurts alot.im not a religious person.but if there is a god up there watching over me.than i want to thank him for bringing nat into my life.im truly grateful for that.and if theres one thing i want.it is to let us make it through.please please please let this relationship last.i would give anything.anything.however hurtful it might be.just let nat and me be together.i know it may seem early to say that we're meant for each other.but somethings telling me that she is the one for me.i've made many mistakes in my life and i know it.but please dont let this relationship be a mistake.she means the world to me and i really dont want to lose her.i regretted not telling her how much she meant to me today.everyday.i might have lived life as a fool but even fools know what love is.and to me.love is nat.   god.grant me strenght to accept those things i cannot change.

      you've failed many times although you may not remember you fell down the first time you tired to walk you almost drowned the first time you tired to swim didn't you? did you hit the ball the first time you swung a bat? heavy hitters.the ones who hit the most home runs also strike out a lot R.H. Macy failed seven times before his store in New York caught on english novelist John Creasey got 753 rejection slip  before he published 564 books Babe Ruth struck out 1330 times but he also hit 714 home runs don't worry about failure worry about the chances you miss when you dont even try.  this message was given to me by national swimmer chan u-nice just a while ago.and it really was comforting.i guess this failure was just a stepping stone for greater things to come.i've had worst things happen in my life than missing out on this record.its hard to pick myself up from such a fall.but i have to.even if it cost me my pride.to know that so many of my team mates and friends still believe that i could make it really cheered me up a whole lot.yes im disappointed but i'll take this as a lesson in life.a valuable one.to constanly remind me that i will be beaten some day if i dont strive to stay at the top.and if i give up that easily.then i'll never be a true champion in anyone's eyes.  nat i'm sorry you had to put up with all my tantrums these past weeks.after much thought.i realised that it really doesnt matter if i broke the record or had a shitty swim.cos i know i'll swim better the next time.what really matters is that i have you and knowing that you were always there for me is all that i'll ever need.swimming might be important to me.but as i looks at things in a different perspective.ive realised that my life wouldn't be as complete as it is right now if it hadnt been for you who stood by me these months.youre the reason i carry on when everything seems to fall apart cos i know that i can find comfort strength and the will to overcome life's greatest challenges as long as i have you by my side.i'm really lucky that youve become part of my life and believe me when i say that i love you cos it comes from the bottom of my heart.  to all my swim mates at the COE.thanks alot guys for making the past few months of training so enjoyable.you guys are really one hell of a team and i hope that this team spirit of yours would carry on.cong.youre the man now in the coe.please guide the guys to greater heights in their swimming carree when me bing and unice are no longer there to help out.i'm truly happy for you for breaking the record and will be back soon enough to start racing the 15hundered again ya?haha.lets try and push the record to greater heights and take singapore's distance events to a greater level.and john!thank you for training me to what i am now.i'm terribly sorry i didnt break the record as you had hope for but cong broke it =) and as long as it is someone from the coe i guess you should be trilled.my promise to you is that i'll do my best in the US in my swimming and behave myself.haha.i'll stay away from the bars you can be sure of that!  having said all that i wanna say.i wish all you guys the very best in whatever you do be it swimming or studies.remeber to give 100 percent in everything you do cos just doing 99 percent alone will NEVER be enough.if you guys haven't know.me and unice will be leaving for the states at the end of the month.we're goign to swim and study at BYU for a peroid of time but we'll be back as long as we're free to visit our family and freinds.i'll keep this blog updated as much as possible to give you guys an insight of what we're doing there.in the mean time happy training and keep up the good work.let everyone know what we at the coe are truly made off and dont disappoint john!cheers people!      nat.i'll return for you.thats a promise.

      todays event really gave me a wake up call.i lost the 1500m freestlye to zhi cong.and he broke the national record.it wasn't me.it was not meant to be.cong was the rightful winner all this while.but what went wrong i kept questioning myself.its not that i didn't train hard.ive put in a 100percent every training session.and i know it.but then again.i could say now that the record was never meant to be mine but that would just be telling the whole world that ive failed in my quest to break it.what i was so confident of doing just a month ago now just came crumbling down and what could be a more cruel way than losing the record to someone else.but thats life and swimming can sometimes be such a cruel sport.its hard for me to sollow such a terrible loss.but a loss is a loss and i sulate cong for his remarkable swim.nobody like losing.but in every race there's got to be a winner and a loser.so happens that today was the day i lost to the better swimmer.coach told me something that i won't forget after the race though.he said that a real champion knows how to win and lose.but am i such a champion?there are doubt surfaceing now.was i ever a champion at all?or just someone who thinks he is one.i didnt know what happened today.i just gave up.i didnt even feel tired after the race.thats not me.i don't give up on things that eaasily.why must it be today?why?why?why?i have to pick myself up but how?where do i start?what do i do now?i've got to rethink everything again from the start.get eveything right.looks like its going to be a long painful journey to recover what ive lost.i'm down.am i broken?only time will tell.   give me strenght to carry on

      impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they have been given than to explore the power they have to change it. impossible is not a fact.it is an opinion. impossible is not a declaration.it is a dare. impossible is potential. impossible is temporary. impossible is nothing. and who else is able to do the impossible but me.
