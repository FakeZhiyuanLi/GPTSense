      i was driving past the airport today and i saw a plane taking off. except i wasn't really looking at the plane. i was distracted by the insanely large amount of brown haze trailing behind the plane. i wonder how many cars worth of smog every plane produces at takeoff. maybe a better measure would be how many la la landians cough up a piece of lung for each departure.   so of course, i thought about that whole thing for a while, and after i ran some errands i went to in-n-out for a 3x3 protein and stuck around for about an hour watching the planes land. i love it when the 747's come in. the rumble coming out of those engines could strip the paint off your car. especially at the proximity i was at. i swear to god i could have gotten on top of one of the tables, jumped, and grabbed onto the wing of a passing airbus.   but after living by the airport for so long, i never notice that awe-inducing tremor anymore. i've been so desensitized to it. hmm... i feel a cheesy truth-revealing metaphor coming up, so i'll stop now.   ---Goei---

      it's days like today that make me wish that nothing else matters other than a ludicrously hot shower right before drifting off into dreamland.  that everything melts away and washes down the drain into indifferent oblivion.  of course that isn't the case; it's never that easy.  but i certainly wish it were.  is this all that life is?  reciprocating moods?  cuz that would defintely suck.  the only kind of new experiences would be in seeing what type of bad/good mood would come next.  that idea kinda fits in with my whole idea that life is built on cycles.  cycles like life and de.ath, the seasons, day and night.  i guess life is just built like that.  but how boring could  that  get?  i can see how there can be some differences that alter each experience, and how we can take part in only one revolution of some cycles, but i would hate to go on being conscious that all good moods will just lead to eventual depression and vice versa.  it's just another one of life's routines.  i'm starting to get an unwanted feeling out of living here, which isn't a good thing cuz i've still got over a year before i get the chance to leave.  it feels like the scales are unbalanced and that maybe it's futile to try to tip them back the other way.  maybe i'd be better off going somewhere else and starting completely over.  without any past inhibitions to anchor me down.  i could reinvent myself.  maybe it's just the whole teen-angst dealy again.  either way, i need to find somewhere to head other than downwards into the drain of indifferent oblivion.  ---Goei---

      mood: listless music: 'u.ntitled #2' by sigur ros  ok, so i can't seem to sleep, and it doesn't seem like sleep is going to come in the next couple of minutes (hopefully not hours), so i suppose i'll just show off my newly acquired HTML coding skills.  my heartfelt thanks to  urlLink Albino Blacksheep's XHTML Tutorial  and to  urlLink W3's HTML Tutorial  as well as their  urlLink Try-It-Yourself thingy .   So now  i figured i'd  just start  showing  off as much  as i  could    thru all   the different ways i know how to   alter text. maybe it's     showboating     but dammit     it's     fun!   enough of that crap.  umm...  here's some original poetry.  i figure it was the first sonnet i ever wrote so it's worth posting, right?  (don't answer that) :    Pink Rose in a Cursed World    Disconnect me from this mortal coil. The innocence of youth takes flight too fast. The horrors here are adequate to spoil A novice conscience; doomed to fail to last. Gone from me as well as several others. Grown-up so quickly not to feel the joys Of youth, but rather witness sisters and brothers Die in themselves as little gi.rls and boys. Too much for me to try to mourn and cope. I need a way to flee from all this angst. But not to take my life upon a rope. I trust in one who now I give my thanks. Though all our world is cursed to fail and fall, A helping hand will help to soothe it all.    ---Goei---    cacafardo: I am not available because I am playing a computer game that takes up the whole screen.

      mood: uncomfortable music: 'soma' by the smashing pumpkins  today was an odd day for me.  i dunno why, i just feel weird today.  i hate these days. they make me feel so out of place.  oh btw, a friend of mine informed me that it's hitler's birthday.  he would've been 115 today.  too bad he sucked so much, he was a really powerful leader and a charismatic speaker.  on a side note, he was also a pervert and a closet homos.exual.  and i also thought it was kinda ironic that his birthday is in spring, the season of life.  anyways, enough about mass mur.dering anti-Semites.  today i was reading this story about a g.irl who dies and is brought back to life through the wonderful dark art of necromancy.  so she comes back as a zombie, but for some reason, she's got morals, which doesn't quite make sense to me.  (why does she become the only zombie in history to think for herself?)  she tries her best to fit in with normal people.  she gets a job and pays the bills, and she starts to assimilate herself into society.  people are even so polite as to not point out that she's about as tan as an albino snowman and just about as warm.  well, it doesn't last very long after that, as she eventually goes insane as her zombie instinct starts to order her to messily consume the brains of the nearest human being.  eventually she gets ki.lled by one of her best friends.  i felt so sorry for her.  she put so much effort into becoming more like the people around her, but eventually, she couldn't escape her true self.  of course it was supposed to be a comedic work, but hey, you know me, always over analyzing and overreacting to everything under the sun.  wouldn't it be fun, though, to live as a zombie, but still be able to think for yourself?  all you'd have to worry about is who's next on the menu.  i'd probably have a ton of fun thinking up a list that might benefit the world by taking some of the more incompetent persons out of the gene pool while getting myself a healthy nutritious meal.  'brainfood' if you will.  har har.  here's some e.e. cummings poetry, just because i'm bored and he kicks ass:  l(a  le af fa  ll  s) one l  iness   ---Goei---

      mood: okay music: 'wandering stars' by portishead  so here we are.  or at least here i am.  well i'd like to say something like 'thus begins our epic journey' but i'm afraid that might be a bit presumptuous.  i'm just someone trying to get his thoughts out and over the vast electronic plains, hopefully to someone who can find some sort of meaning to the jumbled garbage in my head.    ergo, the thesis of my journal is complete: a semi-public journal (depending on who ends up randomly finding this url) that has no subject and every subject.  a no rules journal with no rules about its no rules policy.  er... yeah.  know now that i have a tendency to confuse people.  ok so poetry is one of my passions.  so it would only make sense for me to post some every once in a while.  so as reigning supreme emperor, i hereby proclaim poetry to be outlawed.  of course i'm just kidding, and i'll be posting some of my horrible go.thicky poetry amid the screams of kittens, rainbows, and small children everywhere.  (as a footnote, i'm NOT a go.th. i'm just well-informed, and since ignorance is bliss, knowledge is therefore misery. hence my cynical and melancholic, yet occasionally blissed disposition.  plus i'm probably just another one of those cliche angst-filled youths... so stop stereotyping you stupid know-it-all's!)  either way, this is just another one of those uber-posh blogs that seem to be all over the place now, so enjoy it while the illusion of fad-inflicted happiness seems to be able to wash over us all.   ---Goei---

      there's a definite difference between eating disorders.  of course there's that obvious one: not eating and purging after eating.  i mean in a deeper sense, though.  ( keep in mind that i'm not judging anyone.  i'm just making  one  opinion clear.  no biases, no blind assumptions. )  bulemics are the ones who throw up right after they eat.  it's a classic example of taking the easy way out.  experience the pleasures of eating ( some that might as well be sinful ), then get rid of the weight it carries.  dodge the consequences.  sure it may work to a certain extent, but after all the dust has settled, no progress is made, in a matter of speaking.  anorexics are the ones who don't eat for long long periods of time.  as perverse as it may sound, i have a certain respect for people with this disease.  why?  because this disease takes a massive amount of will power.  let's ponder on this for a while.  say person X is anorexic.  he/she think him/herself to be fat beyond your wildest dreams.  so person X becomes anorexic.  only eating when the pain of hunger is way too much to bear.  think about what person X has to overcome here.  hunger is  the core feeling  in life's existence.  and person X can summon up enough willpower to overcome the oldest, most time-tested urge that has ever existed.  that takes guts to say the least.  these differences can be found in many other places too, as i've discovered.  here's another brief one: vegans & vegetarians.  vegetarians are people who don't eat meat, but rather, rely upon vegetables and occasionally fish.  i've found that people become vegetarians either because they are concerned about their own health or are forced to by doctors because of one of an assorted array of diseases.  in general, vegetarians become so to better their own health, and not necessarily the health of their environment.  vegans are people who don't eat meat as well as any animal products.  in general, they are also environmental activists who believe that the rights of nature/animals are as viable as the rights of humans.  vegans don't eat animal products because they care about the well being of animals.  they greatly respect the environment they live in.  on a completely and totally unrelated note, i don't think anyone can fathom just how much i hate being forced to go to church.  it defeats the whole purpose of religion in the first place.  if you don't want to go, then don't.  if your kids don't want to go, then don't force them.  the whole point of christianity specifically is accepting  whole-heartedly  that someone created you and understanding that thanks should be due.  if you don't believe that and you don't want to believe that, then going to some building filled with people like that isn't going to change you, lest you become totally brainwashed by the continuous chanting.  if you're destined to be a christian or otherwise, then eventually you'll fall into the right place.  that little voice that keeps telling you to go deeper will eventually prevail.   don't force things too early.   nothing makes me more irate than a parent/parents who make it their person business to brainwash their child into becoming another hypocrite worshiper.  don't force it.  ---Goei---

      today i managed to finish off my second notebook.  (huzzah!)  the third will be red.  i finished it whilst on top of ralph's again (btw, make that 3 cups total) but not without an interesting interruption.  i'd been there the day before, and a security guard saw me.  well the same guard was there, and this time he approached me.  not to arrest me, but to make sure i wasn't homeless and living in my car.  (which i kind of deserve from shopping at salvation army so much.)  once it was established that i wasn't, he started going off on tangents left and right, touching on his past experiences with the car-abundant derelicts and their perverse se.xual acts, and even going on to preach the importance of staying in school.  i can't honestly say i was interested, but i sure as hell faked it pretty well.  as i realized that our less than focused conversation was nigh completed, i extended my hand and he took it, telling me that his name was dennis.  i told him my name, and he left me to be alone on the roof once again.  on a side note, my school's award-winning annual art mag,  windowpanes , came out.  i was published alongside a photo montage including both the visages of jim carrey and einstein, as well as a giant hand holding a wooden rod of some sort.  you'd think that this would be an action awarding great prestige and merit on my part, but they managed to ruin my moment by mispelling my first name all 3 times it appeared in the magazine.  on the upside, at least they were consistent; they spelled it wrong the same way all 3 times.  *sigh* at least the poem published was one that means a great deal to me.  here it is in all of its melancholic glory:   Glass Cage     not knowing where to go while you’re marching in the rain on a never-ending search could you be as lost as i?  we meet as fate would have it each following our unknown paths could this be it?  we gather from the same energy we speak of the same language we be from the same be but with one subtle change so slight, but highly prominent could it be so woefully ironic?  my thoughts set free my actions confined to a glass cage while i let you cripple me and leave me and i remain looking for what you could have offered but never quite as complete as you are to me  and you always look back at me but never again with the same face as you continue your long march through the rain    ---Goei---

      We were walking along the dirt path.  "This wine is disgusting," I thought to myself.  At the same moment, Sergio turned to me.  I seemed as though he had read my mind, because he then said, "Whoa, this wine is really strong."  I kept silent, but wholeheartedly agreed.  I'd had 2 glasses and I was already feeling tipsy.  Then again I was such a lightweight.  Eventually we made our way back to the hotelish place.  I personally saw it more as a futuristic holding cell.  Sergio got in his car and left; he was staying elsewhere.  I went to my room, actually my family's room.  We all slept in the same room.  Concentration camp-style, but without the bunk beds and ruthless anti-Semite dictators.  I slipped out of my regular clothes and into my pajamas: black gi-pants and a blue & grey striped longsleeve t-shirt.  With that I returned to the room, tired as I had ever been, and still a bit woozy from that wine.  Before I laid down, I looked around at the half-dozen people that lay strewn about their beds, sound asleep.  I knew these people were not my real family, and yet they were.  Except for my dad, of course.  For some odd reason, he was sleeping on the floor near the entrance.  I tiptoed the short distance to my bed.  Of course, I closed my eyes, but sleep didn't come to me.  Sure, I was tired, but something was keeping me up; I couldn't rest.  Anyway, then something happened that would have definitely woken me up had I been asleep.  Morgan came up and laid down right next to me.  Immediately, I noticed.  Who doesn't notice when a gorgeous bl.onde makes a conscious ( or unconscious for that matter ) effort to share a small bed with you?  That and her hair was strewn about my face.  It smelled of strawberries.  I sat up in a hurry.  I was startled as ever.  "What are you doing?" I asked.  Upon retrospect this was probably one of the stupidest questions to ask.  She said nothing out loud.  Her actions showed her intent with her hand wandering slowly closer to my groin.  I grabbed her hand to stop her.  Upon retrospect, this was probably one of the stupidest things I had ever done.  "Hey!" I whisper-yelled.  Her beautiful face showed no expression.  Her visage was so stern and unchanging, like soft stone.  She said nothing but continually made efforts to grasp me.  Again and again I thwarted her lu.stful attempts.  Eventually I realized what I was turning down and shook myself straight.  I got up to go to the bathroom.  I was still drunk, though, and as soon as I got up I fell right back down.  After having stood up and brushed myself off nonchalantly, I staggered to the bathroom.  The pursuing actions were like some sort of gross arcade game that works on aim under tough circumstances.  After washing my hands as well as the surrounding floor, I returned to the room with a clearer head and an intent to take advantage of Morgan's inde.cent proposal.  But when I got back, she was already asleep in my bed.  As I took a few steps towards an empty bed, I heard my dad whisper my name.  "Brandon," he said.  "You ok?"  "Yeah," I replied.  "Ok," he nodded.  And with that he laid back down on the floor and returned to sleep.  The next morning I piled into the car with a bunch of my friends and headed downtown.  The sky was an odd shade of grey.  After having our fair share of fun, we started to make our way to the movie theatre where we were supposed to meet another group to watch some 3-hour movie.  I really didn't feel like watching, so I was planning on ditching and walking off somewhere to write.  Then my phone rang.  I took my eyes off the road for a moment to find my phone.  I answered.  It was my dad.  "Brandon," he said sternly, "Where are you?"  "We're on our way to the movies, dad.  Can I call you back later?  I'm driving on the freeway right now."  "No, it's ok, I just wanted to ask you to pick up a case of beer on the way home.  Miller Light."  I tried to make sense of what he had just said.  "Dad, I can't.  I'm only 17," I said with a puzzled expression.  "Just get some from th..." and her mumbled off something incoherent.  When I could no longer hear his voice I ended the call and tossed the phone back to whoever was playing with it in the back seat.  "Well, my dad wants me to buy beer now," I announced to the car.  I was met with awkward silence.  We were getting close to our destination, and I was exiting the freeway.  As I turned through the vacant streets, I picked up speed.  Eventually I had to slow down, though.  One street had two firetrucks and an ambulance, sirens blaring, blocking the entrance.  ---Goei---

      well, today sucked, then i found out i was wrong about something depressing, then today didn't suck so much anymore.  took you long enough!  stupid natural forces...  if you feel like finding an empty starbucks cup with my sig and the date on it go to the rooftop of the ralph's here in westchester, across to the steel staircase, and onto the lower rooftop section.  you'll have to jump from the staircase.  my cup is on the side nearest to the street.  it's my new secret writing grotto.  ' but how is it secret if you're talking about it on the internet, where the entire computer-literate world can read about it, you dumbass? '  trust me.  going on how many people read this and acknowledge it as a meaningful usage of time, it'll probably stay secret for a loooong time.  ---Goei---

      i just realized something.  call me morbid, but i think the greatest act of flattery is probably putting a hit out on you.  i mean, it's all relative and different situations may put different spins on it, but you know you're important when someone wants to risk being put in jail for one of the most evil things you can ever do just to get rid of you.  it would make me feel so special if someone ever bothered to risk that much just because of what i'm worth or something that i did that had so much impact.  of course, i'd eventually be de.ad too so that might spoil it a bit.  ---Goei---

      well it finally happened.  i crashed.  after innumerable nights spent wallowing in my own insomnial filth, i spent yesterday night making up for all of it.  from 6 to 6 i was incapacitated by cycle after cycle of r.e.m.  but i do have to say that i feel no different from normal, which is odd since i might as well have been clinically de.ad just a few hours ago.  oh well, just something else to bring up with those friends of mine.  consequently, i had a pretty long dream last nite too.  most of it i can't remember though, but some of it was brought back to memory by conversations during school today.  i remember waking up at 8:26PM, 10:42PM, 3:16AM, and finally at 6:28AM to start to get ready for school.  after 3:16 i had a clear memory of my dream, but afterwards there were no more dreams and a lot of forgetting.  I remember something about there being a huge field that looked kind of like a farm, only without the farm.  there were a big group of us and for no reason we decided to run to one end and back.  i remember being so proud that i paced myself and ran the whole time, albeit not the fastest and first.  later on i realized that this was almost a direct parallel with my flag football days where the warmup for each practice was to run to the far lamppost of westchester park and back.  i recall being in a donut shop at some point, looking at all the different pastries there for the taking.  actually i was eyeing the cruller (however you spell it), and i think it was because of a something totally random i said earlier the day before.  the only other thing i remember was the presence of a devious-looking skinny guy who kept trying to foil my plans for some outlandish reason.  i think it was because i was watching a tv show right before my extended nap in which there was a similar character who works for a corrupt mayor.  hmm... seems there's an explanation for everything.  how boring.  ---Goei---

      whew! a wave of relief just washed over me. i finished a final project not too long ago. actually about 3 hours ago. so what am i doing still up 3 hours later? why, basking in the glorious rays of insomnia of course. hey, cut me a break here. i don't like the sun so naturally i function better in absence of it. it's not my fault someone decided that that's a disease.   everything today seemed to want me to sink towards one hell of a bad mood. oddly enough, i didn't succumb to the will of this karmatic force. but it seemed like some of my friends did. they really did seem sad today, and for some reason i started to get  jealous  of them. ok, so i'm not in a bad mood, but i sure as hell am backwards a lot of the time.   ah yes. the best news of the day. i finished my first sestina today, and if you don't know what the hell a 'sestina' is,  urlLink i dont blame you . most people who aren't poetry buffs or english majors will give you a funny look if you use the word 'sestina' in a sentence. personally, i think it sounds like a type of mexican party. but i digress. this poem took me the longest ever to write. i put about 5 or 6 hours of work into it, and it's mostly cuz of that ludicrously inane endword pattern. but it's so damn rewarding. plus it was a good re-initiation, as i haven't been writing much lately. eh? what's that? you want to see it? oh, if you insist:     Murphy     “Never forget,” she said. “Never forget us.”  And with her words, she left. Away. Away to  A new life. New hopes. New dreams. New everything.  Car-door click echoed quietly in my head.  Gathering dust storms only clouded my thoughts.  She disappeared. “Why is it so cold?” I asked.   Again, again, again. I asked, I asked, I asked.  Where were we going? Where would the world take us?  Together. Together based on wishful thought.  Wherever. Wherever she goes, I go too.  Lies, lies, lies. No love. No hate. All in my head.  Gleaming, seeming real. Dreams shatter like everything.   Everything is nothing. Nothing is everything.  Question after question I posed and asked,  But to no avail. My world sent me head  Over heels. Drowning in memories of “us”.  Lost in lovesick seas. Blurred into one from two.  Lingering in the past and smothered in thought.   Life is a cruel joke. We drift through empty thought,  Leaving nothing accomplished and everything  Desired. Livid flames burn inside me. “It’s too  Fu.cking much!” I cry. The cold flames cry back, asking,  “Then why do you still ponder and dream of ‘us’,  When obviously it was all in your head?”   With that I slowly withered. “Nothing ahead  Or behind can save me,” I honestly thought.  The lush green pastures of youth blackened as “us”  Was placed on a pedestal above everything  And devoutly ignored. Sunken down, I asked  For solitude. To never be spoken to.   Shattered. And then one day she returned. All too  Late. She tried her best to get through to my head,  But to no avail. “Who are you?” she asked.  All I did was gaze into her eyes. “ I thought  Our love would last. What happened to everything?  What happened to you? What happened to us?”   And so I answered everything that she asked  With a phrase all too simple: “I forgot us.”  I hung my head and left her, still deep in thought.     ---Goei---

      ugh. what a dreadfully long day this has been.   i had an ok day at school today, but i think it's one of those occasions where i think too much about some things. that always seems to happen to me. when i think about ' things ', for lack of a better word, i start to get really down. it's just a truth of life i suppose. (if you think i only update this thing when i feel like crap you'd probably be right. it's those feelings that make me  want  to write.)   i've got almost no homework, though, and that's something i can be thankful for. there's just one thing left for me to do and trust me it's a big one. a final project actually. for  the hobbit . a book which i did not read. and am required to write a 5 verse song along the lines of. dammit, what a deep deep hole i've seemed to dig myself into. procrastination ki.lled the... uhh.... everything. yeah...   whatever. these days make me feel empty. not in the 'drained of energy' way, though. more in that 'uselessness' line of thinking. but that's a feeling meant to be logged in a different notebook. (yes, i do keep another notebook for the more private subject matter. and no, you won't be seeing it... that is unless i become really famous and/or de.ad. *insert reference to kurt cobain's journals here*)   ---Goei---

      this last weekend came straight from hell. and i think the ongoing heatwave here in socal serves to make it official. there were so many different things i had to work on, the biggest being a research paper i managed to save for the extreme end of the weekend. so thank god that's over with.   but then i come back and the teacher who just assigned us the paper slapped on another project and a sentence outline, which again, i've put off until the last moment. now if you know of anything more stupid in the world than a sentence outline, you should inform the freaking smithsonian cuz that's gotta be some sort of wonder of the world. i understand the concept of an outline: a brief overview of a text. it's really helpful usually. but adding the word ' sentence ' (as in each entry must be a complete sentence) turns that helpful assignment into a paradoxical nuisance. basically, a sentence outline is just like copying every other sentence in the passage. next time i'm just gonna turn in a xeroxed copy of the text, white out every other unimportant sentence, and see what happens. how's that for classic teenage rebellion?   ---Goei---

      these last few days have been somewhat odd.  in a good way, though.  that's what makes it so odd.  weird in a good way is extremely rare for me.  the times are enveloped by a warm glowing aura.  a beacon of light shimmering through the dense grey fog.  and although that makes me sound like a hippie higher than the channel 4 weather balloon, it's good to be able to say that.  anyways, the other day i found an old pair of pants laying on top of a pile of clothes ready to be donated to goodwill.  at first i didn't look twice, but about 10 mins later it dawned on me how freakin awesome these pants were.  i went back and looked at them again.  they were grey with pinstripes, and i realized that they were from a suit that i worn while i was still in middle school.  for no reason other than my own insane curiosity i tried them on.   perfect fit .  now i have a 'new' pair of pants that follow in the odd new trend of the times: for some unworldly reason, they fit and i look better in them now than i did when i was in the 7th grade.  lastly, i've been setting late night records.  it seems i'm able to keep the attention of someone for much much longer than i thought.  last night's chat was until about 5AM when my tired and grumbly dad stumbled into my room broke up my latest meeting with the newest member of Insomniacs Anonymous.  well, it's not like she was keeping me up anyway.  it was more like keeping me company.  ---Goei---

      last night i talked on the phone with someone until 3.  it would have been longer, but my phone ran out of minutes.  the forces of nature and prepaid minutes are forever against me.  it's amazing how much i enjoy talking to someone so early into the morning.  it's definitely a change from watching t.v. and surfing the internet all night.  and it relaxed me  so  much.  last night's sleep was the best i'd had in an extremely long time.  and now i've woken up in a splendid mood, which is odd but seemingly possible for me.  it's a co-dependent world out there.  ---Goei---

      so i've found a new hobby.  it includes lightly tossing airplane-shaped sheets of paper from the summit of an above ground facility.  more specifically, my little spot above the neighborhood ralphs.  you know how on windy days you sometimes see birds flying against the wind?  they aren't really flying, though.  it's more like they're hovering in one spot with their wings spanned out because of that intense wind.  that's how i feel right now.  like i'm trying to go somewhere even though it seems hopeless.  futile yet beautiful.  on a related sidenote, it only took me half a dozen tries to get an airplane to do the same thing.  you get a certain sense of accomplishment after getting one to do so.  after that last paper airplane, though, i realized that what i was doing ("littering") was, albeit for the sake of "temporal art", illegal.  then i realized that since it was after midnite and i haven't had my driver's license for more than a year, that my driving around was pretty illegal too.  i also noticed later that night as i was doing a donut in the nearby parking lot of a mervyn's that that was pretty damn illegal as well.  so what do you think?  am i enough of a mix between angsty, artsy, and crazy?  ---Goei---    "oww, my sternum..."

      i think school sucks.   obviously .  most people my age would agree.  at least those who don't wish to be stereotypically stuffed into a locker.  but its absence has made me realize that it's definitely good for something.  let me allude to a poem i first read while in the class of the best teacher i've ever had:  Mr. Timothy Bauer.  i was a freshman taking his english 1 class.  i even remember i was in his period 2 class.  period 1's teacher was oppressive and period 3 was algebra so that speaks for itself.  Mr. Bauer's class was one of the few classes i always looked forward to.  anyways, the poem, which i don't remember much about except for the theme and the metaphor, was about a woman, the speaker, who received a fresh bouquet of roses everyday from her lover.  there were 3 stanzas.  in the first two stanzas, she speaks of how wonderful and beautiful each rose is, but by the last stanza, the reader can definitely recognize the harsh sarcastic tone.  but why?  roses are beautiful flowers, no matter how cliche they are.  but the fact that she got them each and everyday made her utterly sick of them.  here's where school steps in.  school takes up the majority of the week.  then there's the relief of the weekend.  after a good weekend, and  especially  after a bad one, one might think, 'i wish it was always the weekend!'  ah, foolish youth.  that's a bad wish.  but the real world shows no mercy.  reality presents us with: *trumpets blare* summer.  the  3 month long  weekend.  school sucks + no school = constant happiness, right?  wrong!  the world isn't that logical, dammit!  the short weekends are so much better.  why?  because going through a week of school makes us yearn and desire for that last bell.  and when it comes, you had better believe it's good.  as Steve Miller of the Steve Miller Band once said, 'you know you got to go through hell before you get to heaven.'  otherwise, we'd get sick of everything so fast.  ...  *cough*  ---Goei---

      It was the first day of school.  The place seemed all too familiar; after all, we only shifted one room down the hall.  We gathered outside before school on the area we would later use for lunch.  As the bell rang, we spread out to the area with no tables and just a shallow slope covered in iceplant.  Soon enough, a heavyset balding man stepped out of a door across the yard from us carrying a stack of greenish paper;  upon closer inspection, they were actually thick pieces of cardboard.  Wedged above his ear was a black sharpie, and underneath the familiar school colors of his coach's jacket were a clean white dress shirt and a gold necktie.  The fact that his shirt was tucked in made sure that it showed lots of curves.  In fact, everything about him showed curves.  The down filling and moderate lu.ster of his jacket amplified the roundness of his arms and his cheeks were like flesh-colored beachballs on his face.  But he was fairly young: probably in his mid 20's.  I suddenly wondered what array of psychological problems could have caused him to grow so obese.  Then he started to hand out the green slates of cardboard.  Mine was the first card he gave out.  Miraculously, he already knew all of our names.  As he passed out the rest I look down at what was written on the card.  In black sharpie, my name was on the top, and under it were 4 sections.  I read the first one: "Homework Evasion Attack".  And under that section was a jumble of black marker where he had blacked out a huge mistake, then under that, a series of arrows and buttons, much like one would expect to find when playing Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter.  'Wow, how weird,' I thought to myself.  I put the card down and looked at the teacher.  He began to lecture us on some sort of kickball game we were going to play.  I wasn't exactly listening, but the rules sounded absurd.  I turned to Tara, who was sitting next to/across from me, facing me.  "Do you get what that point of this is?"  I asked her.  "Yeah, it's not that hard," she replied.  "Don't worry, I'll play with you."  At the same moment, our makeshift coach said something about running in circles after hitting the ball to a certain spot.  It all made less and less sense as he went on and on.  But I got to cr.ack my jokes and Tara got her shots in too.  I don't think we really heard a thing that fat man was saying.  ---Goei---

      everyone went to knott's berry farm without me today.  sounds sad, i know.  it's no big deal, though.  it might be just the denial talking, but i don't think it would have been worth putting out the cash for it.  it's something like 35 for admission then there's always money for food/drinks, assorted carnival-style games, not to mention it's about a 45 minute drive from westchester going 80 the whole time.  think of those outrageous socal gas prices!  all in all, the only thing i've done all day was buy a 3-pack of my favorite pens cause i was out and a father's day card in advance.  that and battling the fierce boredom that accompanies being completely alone and aware that your friends are having a blast somewhere else.  *big emo tear*  really though, i don't think i'm missing out on much.  my elementary school had the year-end tradition of going to knott's on the last day of school every year.  it was only fun because there was no more school.  other than that, it wasn't that good.  honestly.  the only thing that sucked happened early this morning.  at 10AM.  ok, maybe not that early.  meh, early enough.  anyways, my plan was to tire myself out the night before so that i would sleep well enough into the afternoon so as to loosen the ties that boredom slaps on you.  i made it  perfectly clear  that i wasn't attending the snoopy-themed road-trip, but all it takes is that one deviation.  so i get a call at 10AM sharp.  from robert.  those of you who know robert know that he is outspoken.  and loud.   so very loud .  i answered with a weak 'hello' and he asked if his call woke me.  hmm.  yes.  yes it did.  *sigh*  after a quick clarification as to why i wasn't going, i hung up and collapsed back into my bed.  but 10AM is that perfect time between early and late morning.  that time when it is impossible for the average teenager ( especially one less than one week into summer vacation ) to wake up and properly function but still late enough so that drifting back into the fluffy white cloudlands of r.e.m.-landia is just as unimaginable.  so i laid there on my back looking at the white ceiling for about 10 more minutes before getting up, brushing my teeth, and preparing for the typical 12-hour summer isolation period, only this time it was the special extended 15-hour edition.  ok, so maybe my stark white room has made me into a bit of a drama king today.  so what?  poop on you.  ---Goei---

      ok, so things have really gone downhill since school let out for the summer.  but hey, that's just the cycle of life playing out again, right?  at the top, the only place you can go is down, and vice versa.  i know that sounds horribly sour.  life can be quite the bitch, though.  things seem more and more confusing right now.  anyways, i've been busy doing nothing, and dammit, that's the way i like it.  this season is traditionally one of increased nocturnal habits.  maybe not  entirely  nocturnal, but defintely shifted way off from 'normal'.  as in away from the sunny parts of the morning.  yuck.  i eat my breakfast at 2PM thank you very much.  i don't think i'm gonna be able to keep up my odd habit, though.  it only took me about 4 days to realize the following: without the money i get from driving a carpool and without school during the day to distract me from going to random places and spending willy-nilly, i'm in for a summer on my knees, asking unmerciful parents for funds.  so in comes a new task: job-hunt.  yuck once more.  so far i've applied to 2 places: a bookstore and a pet store.  mainly because they're both really close to my house.  a third application is going to be filled out soon for, get this:  an ambulance dispatch .  holy crap.  it turns out my uncle works for American Medical Response and said he knows of some openings.  if i do get the job, i feel sorry for the sick/dying person that's gonna get an ambulance sent through me.  seeing as how i might strategically route that ambulance past a couple markets and grocery stores.  two birds with one stone, right?  one last thing before i continue brooding for tonite.  i found myself reading the  urlLink teenage scrawlings of Heather Meadows , a reader of mine.  and it struck me how even ten years ago, the focus was inevitably...   boys.  hehe.  and i'm embarrassed to say that right now i, as a teen, feel the same way.  not about  boys  of course. (stop looking at me that way!)  i mean about my own ( female ) romantic interests.  i hate to admit it, but i really get hung up on this sort of thing.  and it ki.lls me to see how dependent i am on an outside source.  but that's the way it is.  and as long as i'm here as functioning human being, i'll need to feel cherished by  at the very least  one other person.  that's the way it's always going to be.  if you haven't already guessed the underlying purpose of that last little rant, i'm being greatly confused by a certain romantic interest.  and i'm trying my hardest not to turn into a whiney emo kid.  ( it's hard for me because i already have the setting: reckless white suburbia )  anyways, that'll be the last you cyber-spectators will hear of that chapter of my life.  i prefer to write about those things separately in a concrete notebook.  don't worry, i'll keep brooding, you keep reading, deal?  ---Goei---

      blood pressure is at an all time low at around 4am.  but don't worry, i'll make sure to be weary of light-headedness and vertigo.  well the weekend so far seems to be going better than i had planned.  ( might i refer to my theory regarding  urlLink pessimism . )  SAT II's called for an essay on making choices, so i wrote of a metaphorical path with innumerable forks symbolizing decisions... somewhat a la Robert Frost.  i hope the english teachers grading that thing see past the quasi-plagiarism and eat the poetic value right up.  there was a really nice moon out last night: full and low to the horizon, making it huge and yellow too.  i saw it while i was out with a few friends.  of course, as soon as i mentioned anything about the night sky, they replied with awkward silence.  it's as if they think that each time i throw the slightest glance upwards, i enter some weird reflective state and have to remain untouched to reach nirvana-like status.  *sigh*  well my friend's sister seems to think that two things come out of my mouth when i speak: 1) trivial facts, and 2) depressing statements regarding my past.  and so, she made it her job to play an invisible violin everytime i utter a monosyllabic noise.  i actually think it quite amusing.  how many people do i need to have following me to legally have a 'posse'?  enough.  i've been awake for almost 21 hours, and that's way too much for a saturday night/sunday morning.  humans + no sleep = bands like deerhoof (go ahead, if you can find them, look up the lyrics for a few of their songs.  you'll see what i mean.)  ---Goei---    Airliner fallopian juke  Open up wide

      isn't it funny how so many things can happen to you in one day?  they all seem to catapult my mood in different directions.  maybe it's just an abnormally high influx of hormones.  (i am still a teenager, you know.)  speaking of moods, i'm pretty much preparing myself for a bad one from this morning until about monday afternoon.  yep, this weekend's gonna suck.  pretty hard, too.  i've got a final tomorrow, and i would've studied (really) but i forgot my book 12 miles away in my locker, so i'm planning to compress my study time within the one period i have before.  i'm not really that worried about it, though.  it's chemistry, and despite my profound disdain for numerical academics, a steady supply of homework points have allowed me to have a high A and a chance for an A+ depending on the outcome of the final.  no big deal, it's like flipping a coin for either a ferrari or a lamborghini.  either way you're gonna go fast enough to strip the paint off the asphalt.  but then!  oh... saturday morning are the SAT II's, which i am taking two of.  and i've heard that these tests are uber hard.  might just be rumors though.  we'll see.  that, and it basically robs me of weekend sleep: the best sleep next to dr.ug-induced quasi-comatose sleep.  then more finals on monday and wednesday.  two on monday, one of which i couldn't care less about, and one more on wednesday.  then:  freedom   until late august of course.  then that whole theory i have of the world working only in cycles plays out again.  it really can drive you crazy.....*^_^*  ---Goei---

      this last week seems kind of useless to me.  if it wasn't for a couple of early finals, i would have given up a long time ago.  it seems that i've wasted my entire holiday weekend pseudo-socializing.  i have a final project due tomorrow and haven't started.  it's a powerpoint.  on adverbs.  whatever.  there should be a legal limit to disillusionment before the age of consent.  i think that would preserve inn.ocence better than censorship.  think of how many teens (pre or otherwise) would be happy still believing in santa and the tooth fairy.  of course, that's a horrible plan.  so strike it from the record.  santa is d.ead and let's leave it that way.  our society is moving forward so fast that ages mean nothing anymore.  whether that's good or bad is a matter of personal experience.  sleep would be really good right about now.  yeah.  sleep.  ---Goei---

      i think saturday's going to be norm's night from now on.&nbsp; i went there by myself tonight to have my customary hot beverage. &nbsp;in this night's case: tea.&nbsp; and although the tea wasn't very good, what attracted me towards it wasn't really the taste, but rather the temperature.&nbsp; hovering between lukewarm and scalding is where i like it.  been feeling ignored as of late.&nbsp; the fact that i went to norm's alone tonight is evidence of that.&nbsp; there's always two sides to everything, though.&nbsp; this time, the silver lining was (as always) a boost in self-reflection and especially in my sense of random creativity.&nbsp; and let me stress the part about  random .&nbsp; case in point: my two new bracelets.&nbsp; on my right&nbsp;wrist is my own gray, waterproof masterpiece: three rolled up and braided strips of duct tape made to form a classic example of neo-kitsch 'jewelry'.&nbsp;wrapped around my left wrist is one of man's greatest tools in the fight against hunger.&nbsp; 'donated' by the good people from norm's 24-hour diner, i unveil to you the stainless steel magnum opus of mankind, assigned to decorative duties on my wrist: a fork.&nbsp; it took me a while, but i managed to bend the fork enough to resemble a retarded ellipse around my wrist.&nbsp; if everything i'm doing is subconsciously for the purpose of drawing attention to myself, i think these two new additions to my wardrobe will succeed in reeling in the comments and compliments.  soon, i'll miss being the sensible one.&nbsp; maybe tomorrow.  ---Goei---

      *sigh*  horrible horrible day.  i don't know the real reason why.&nbsp; i think half of it's because i was left out all day (beach day today, so no sympathy for me there) and the other half was a psychological thing.&nbsp; you know, i only amplified it in my head because i  thought  i was having a bad day.&nbsp; whatever way i got here, i still feel like crap, so i guess it doesn't matter all that much.&nbsp; that is until they commit me and try to look at where everything started to go down the crapper.&nbsp; then they'll pay attention to the details.&nbsp; apparently, those little things only matter once everything is said and done, and all the consequences have been&nbsp;played out.  in the last two days, i encountered a few odd displays of ' bigotry '.&nbsp; it's in quotes because i might just be overreacting.&nbsp; it doesn't really matter if i am though, because&nbsp;the two instances&nbsp;disturbed me quite a bit.  the first was on thursday afternoon.&nbsp; i was dropping off a few bags of old clothes to goodwill.&nbsp; i&nbsp;went in carrying the bags and walked up to&nbsp;the counter where donations are recorded.&nbsp; the guy there said to me, 'donation?' and i replied, 'yeah.'&nbsp; so he starts to fill out the tax refund receipt and tells me what i need to fill out, and as he hands the form to me, he casually just says, 'so you're chinese?'&nbsp; and i didn't know what to do so i just nodded and said, 'yeah.'&nbsp; so that one's not too bad right?&nbsp; it still shocked me, but i wasn't that angry, just surprised that he could muster up the courage to just up and ask me.  the second time was much worse.&nbsp; it actually happened earlier tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;i already&nbsp;felt like a giant walking headache, so it set me up for a bad response.&nbsp; i was just standing around in front of my friend's house with a bunch of my other friends.&nbsp; i was casually leaning on my car, and another car drives by.&nbsp; a bmw.&nbsp; the&nbsp;white guy&nbsp;in the backseat said three different things as he was passing by.  they were: 1)"Sup, n*gger?" at which point i ignored him.&nbsp; then: 2)"Fine, f*ck you!" and finally in a harsh, loud tone: 3)"Chink!"  this guy picked the wrong day to pi.ss me off.&nbsp; i was angry from that last thing he said, but by that time, the car was impossible to catch up to.&nbsp; and meanwhile, while i'm standing there about to explode into a bloody rage, the first thing my friends do is start laughing.&nbsp; i didn't really think that was appropriate or very considerate.&nbsp; so i was&nbsp;standing there amidst laughter with my fists clenched and steam shooting out of my ears, and all i&nbsp;could do&nbsp;was sulk.&nbsp; so sulk it is.  right now i'm the unrivaled prince of lethargy.&nbsp; listening to jazz, trying to cool off and slow everything down.&nbsp; music-induced comatose is my specialty.&nbsp; i've got three candles lit, one's about to die.&nbsp; the light's are off, the fan's on low, and i'm hoping things will lighten up again soon.  ---Goei---

      remind me never to pull an all-nighter again.&nbsp; i felt like crap for the next two days.&nbsp; a constant throbbing headache.&nbsp; it took a night of binging on&nbsp;3 different flavors of ice cream and 2 bowls of some sort of 'chocolate-covered sugar ' cereal to stabilize myself.&nbsp; i'm ok now though.&nbsp; and it was definitely a new experience that i can check off of my hypothetical list.  so tonite my dad came back from indonesia.&nbsp; he spent an extra week over there.&nbsp; he was telling me about all the old friends he met up with.&nbsp; one of them he hadn't seen since '68 or so.&nbsp; that's insane.&nbsp; i wonder if that kind of thing's going to happen to me.&nbsp; some of the people i know so well right now could just disappear from my life for three decades at a time.&nbsp; it's a very sad and overwhelming thought.  ok, i came up with a plan.&nbsp; i'm over my whole secretive weblog phase and i think that i want more people to visit this site now.&nbsp; i'm not one to just tell everyone directly, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;i think of that as bragging, and i don't like to brag because it makes me feel like a pretentious 'bahhs-tahd'.&nbsp; so here's where my plan kicks in:  i'm pretty much poor and i have no job.&nbsp; i spend half the day sleeping and the other half in my room with the door closed and the&nbsp;blinds drawn.&nbsp; at night i go out only to spend money on or with my friends or for band practice with expensive equipment i have mostly  not  paid for.&nbsp; all in all, i'm a pretty expensive moocher.&nbsp; so i'm thinking, if i'm spending all this cash,  that's  gotta be the best way to indirectly spread this web address around.&nbsp; i'm gonna take however much money i've got in my wallet and some of what's in my bank account and break it up into one's.&nbsp; so maybe 50 one dollar bills.&nbsp; and on each one, i'll write the address of my weblog.&nbsp; my hope is that curiosity will get the best of the next person who handles that note; i know that if i found a web address on my money, i'd visit it right away.&nbsp; so what do you think?  i'll probably start on it tonight.&nbsp; i was relatively bored during the day because everyone went to the beach.&nbsp; i don't  do  the beach.&nbsp; it's a blatant meat market that raises your&nbsp;chances for skin cancer, the s there are usually exactly the kind i'm not interested in,&nbsp;and i'm an advocate&nbsp;of 'pale beauty'. ( not a go.th, not a go.th, not a go.th, not a go.th, not a go.th... )&nbsp; anyways, because i didn't have anything to do all day and there was no food in the house because i was in charge the last week, i ended up drinking a few gallons of the famous javanese coffee i bought a week ago in indo and playing pinball on my computer.&nbsp; i've been wired all day and when&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;finally came back, i ended up pleading with my drummer to let me play the drums for the fastest, most difficult song we can play.&nbsp; (' the everlasting gaze ' by the smashing pumpkins)&nbsp; it was extremely cathartic.  so off to writing.&nbsp; fyi, i'll be using a Sanford Sharpie: "Extra Fine Point Permanent Marker".   ---Goei---

      if there is ever some sick deity that allows me to bear offspring, i will name him  or  her Norm.&nbsp; i just got back from driving around trying to find an all  night diner with a friend.&nbsp; we ended up driving through several suburbs until we got lost on purpose (because that's what&nbsp;we gotta do when i'm driving) and ended up in torrance.&nbsp; now my school has people who lives in almost all areas of los angeles, and torrance is usually the butt of all of their 'my city is better than your city' jokes.&nbsp; but let me tell you right now to never believe those idiots.&nbsp; we found a norm's diner (who's motto is ' we never close ') next to a cadillac dealership in torrance.&nbsp; as soon as we stepped in, i was complemented by a waitress for wearing my bauhaus shirt.&nbsp; not many people complement me on wearing this shirt, even though they were the godfathers and pioneers of transitional punk/new wave music.&nbsp; they spurred the traditional 80's go.th aesthetic.&nbsp; norm's was growing on me.&nbsp; i don't think anyone had ever recognized the pair of shiny silver eyes on my shirt.&nbsp; of course it was nearing midnite, and many people who remember and fervently listen to bauhaus&nbsp;are prone to working these shifts regularly too.&nbsp; hey, i listen to them and i would love to work the graveyard shift.    &nbsp;  so anyway, we were seated and given&nbsp;menus, but all we ( *cough* ever ) wanted was ( *cough cough* everything ) coffee, so my friend and i ordered 2 cups and an additional hot chocolate, which had, might i add, free refills.&nbsp; they gave us a freaking boatload of coffee.&nbsp; the pitcher-thingy poured us a total of 6 cups.&nbsp; and the hot chocolate was both hot as well as chocolatey and offered a bonus adjective too:  creamtastilicious  (i made it up myself).    &nbsp;  it was my idea to order the hot chocolate.&nbsp; it was solely for the purpose of mixing with the coffee.&nbsp; damn.&nbsp; adding anything creamtastilicious to coffee instantly makes for caffeine-induced nirvana.&nbsp; we were going to start bottling and selling our newly discovered hybrid drink, but eventually we realized that we were idiots for not noticing the fact that we had just made a mocha latte.&nbsp; one of the most popular coffee drinks in the world.&nbsp; so what?&nbsp; who cares?&nbsp; it was half the price of getting one at starbucks and norm's never closes so ha.    &nbsp;  you might be asking to your monitor at this point, ' why the hell would you drink 4 cups of delicious delicious coffee at midnite, the prime hour for r.e.m. sleep ? '&nbsp; well put.&nbsp; well one of my friends has been grounded.&nbsp; poor poor friend.&nbsp; but instead of the traditional 'stay in your room' penalty, his reprocussion includes painting the house in mid-summer.&nbsp; i have been recruited to help.&nbsp; so he plans on starting at around 9am, which is about  my  prime hour for r.e.m. sleep.&nbsp; that will not do.&nbsp; that will not do at all.&nbsp; i'm not planning on waking up at 9am.&nbsp; so i won't.&nbsp; in other words, i'll just stay up all night.&nbsp; i can hear the audience's gasps, but honestly if i was going to sleep, it would be at 6am anyway.&nbsp; i still have jet lag, but it hasn't gone away because i never sleep normal hours.&nbsp; so don't pity me.&nbsp; i get to&nbsp;waste my time watching a few newly acquired dvd's and setting high scores on ' 3D space cadet pinball .    ---Goei---

      ok i'm back.  actually i got back 6 hours ago.  i just didn't feel like updating.  right now i'm in the throes of a typical post-longhaul flight insomnia.  it might be jetlag; i'm not sure.  does it count as jetlag if it happens all the time?  anyways, the flight was horrible.  once i put away all my carry-ons and sat down, the captain came onto the speaker and said there was a 'technical problem with one of the aircraft's essential mechanisms'.  i think that's one of the worse things to say when you're about to take a long flight.  once i got to lax, i went through immigration fairly quickly, but when it came time to claim baggage, i got screwed again.  i waited for close to a hour for my bags, and failed miserably at beating the long customs line.  you see, my baggage came directly from jakarta; i didn't have to check in again at hong kong.  so my baggage had no limiting factor.  it went straight into the cargo.  among the first.  and therefore, among the last to be unloaded.  i got picked up at 11, while i was supposed to be out by 930.  during the flight, i did manage to write a poem composed almost entirely of song titles, though, and it makes sense...  at least to me:   Soundbox     i'm just wasting time. in a silent way, in a good way, but in dreams. only in dreams.  when you sleep, when you sleep. honestly, it never entered my mind.  blissed and gone, i drown. in soot and stars. in you, embraceable you.  come in alone. all blues, blue in green  we are the backdrifts, burning from the inside. optimistic. it's just like heaven.  perfect pale blue eyes. we'll be awake, waiting for the film's exit musi ,    il bang, bang, i die of a broken heart.    ---Goei---

      i'm in hong kong again.  this time in transit back to l.a.  no, i'm not in the business class lounge again.  my dad's miles aren't here to save me anymore.  i'm flying home solo.  which means that the next flight is going to be half a day in economy class, and also explains that odd 'word' that describes my mood.  this computer is one i found in an obscure corner of the airport.  sounds weird, i know.  but there are six computer at this 'samsung e-lounge' and they are supposed to appease the needs of every techhead roaming around in the airport.  i spent half an hour waiting in line for this computer and i'll be damned if i won't draw out my session.  my layover is 2 hours, and in those two hours i've spent maybe about 1/3 the amount i spent in indo the last week  in this airport alone .  i bought a book, a magazine, and a cup of coffee, and i think the equivalent in u.s. currency was $30.  i think 1 week is the perfect length of time for my stays in indonesia.  the last day or so was when i started to get really sick of everything under the sun.  and i do mean literally under the sun.  jeez...  let me give you an example.  the other day, one of my aunts insisted that we all go out karaoke-ing.  i do sing in a band, but the other instruments drown my voice out enough so i'm not so self-concious.  plus, the songs the karaoke people choose mostly suck.  i ended up singing only the beatles songs they had.  we did get a private room, though, so my embarassment was greatly limited.  so when i get home, i'm all alone for the most part.  my parents probably told all the relatives i have in town to keep surveillance on me.  you know, group conspiracy, big brother style.  that's them.  totally their style.  ok i'm at gate 21 and i have to make my way to gate 63 so i should probably get walking.  trains are for wussies.  ---Goei---

      someone/anyone/everyone needs to remind me when i get home:  ring mod   i'm in jakarta now.  apparently, the city is celebrating it's 477th anniversary, so all the sales and marketing gimmicks are flaring up.  477 is a huge number.  freakin huge.  so i've been talking a lot with my aunt.  catching up on the last 6 months and such, it's been really great.  her english is much better than i expected too.  in the past week it's been fun getting around, seeing as how each indonesian driver is playing their own version of gta: central java.  the traffic is horribly insane.  no one cares what anyone else does as long as you get to where you're going as fast as humanly possible.  the streets are hazy with unregulated exhaust fumes and the blaring horns and highbeams of hundreds of thousands of air conditioned suv's.  that, and jakarta is extremely prone to cloudbursts and flash flooding around this time of year.  oh, and did i mention that this city is quite possibly the hottest city in indonesia?  jeez...  anyways, the other day i realized that my grandma, my dad, and i all walk with a slight limp.  weird.  i'll be in jakarta for one more day after tonight, then my outward bound flight leaves at 9am the day after tomorrow.  i'm flying home by myself.....^_^.....and i'll have the house to myself for a week......^_^.........o_o wait.....what am i gonna do about food?.....   o_o*  ---Goei---

      tonite, i'm posting from solo, the epicenter of food on my trip.  here's a quick itinerary:  legend--> city, amount of time spent here, epicenter of ___  yogya (pronounced ' joke-jah '), 4 days, epicenter of family jakarta, 2 days, epicenter of shopping solo, 1 day, epicenter of food  and good god is it the epicenter of food.  the irony of it is, though, that i spend the least of my time here, and the most in the most boring place, the epicenter of family, yogya.  anyways, i took a walk the other day around the neighborhood i was staying at in yogya, around my grandma's house.  it turns out there's a new convenience store down the street, and being an american, i gotta love my convenience.  guess what i found right next to it.  no, it wasn't a flower and kitten shop.  it was a masonry (is that the right word?) and not just any masonry.  it was one that made gravestones.  peachy.  note to self: don't make anymore nocturnal trips to the convenience store.  anyhow, my trip's been going just about how i planned.  a lot of waiting, a lot of sweating, and a lot of eating.  it's been 2 days since we got here, and already my diet's been obliterated by the evil assortment of fried goody-goodies or as we call them here,  goreng-gorengan .  my diet regiment's coming back with a vengeance once i land back in the US.  ok, tomorrow i take the 2 hour car ride back to yogya and on the 10th i fly to jakarta.  i'll probably post again then.  toodles.  ---Goei===

      ok, 15 hours into my trip and already it's a hell of a lot better than i expected.  i'm posting from the hong kong airport after having sampled each of the complementary food and drinks they've supplied me.  oh yeah, and they have showers here too.  and you people know how i love showers.  the shower heads are those 'waterfall' types that are directly installed into the ceiling.  ooh la la.  right now i'm posting from an uber posh computer room with apparent dsl or cable or t1 connections and guess what's on my right...   an indoor pool/zen meditative plant garden thingy.  i thought we had it good back in the states.  i think i'll just live here in the airport.  i already look like a local anyways.  and the job opportunities for english speakers are more abundant.  the only problem is the intense heat and humidity, especially during this time of the summer.  we arrived at about 6am and it was raining.  a huge thunderstorm.  and the temperature at 6am during a storm was eighty-freaking-four degrees fahrenheit.  but that's why i'd stay indoors in this swanky business class lounge.  oh, and oddly enough i'm pretty well rested.  normally, i can't sleep a wink on the plane, but my dad, being the businessman he is, travels almost constantly and had enough miles to get me upgraded to business class.  so i got the stereotype california star treatment.  hehehe.  my flight to jakarta leaves in an hour at 9am, so i think i'll tire myself out by walking around and through the 'free duty' stores, as they like to call them here.  i'll post again once i'm in indo.  ---Goei---

      so yeah.  independence.  woo.  honestly, it just feels like any other day.  i've never been patriotic or excessively proud.  i don't know why.  whatever.  i'm not saying that you shouldn't, it's just not my thing.  so you go ahead and do the whole bbq/fireworks thing.  i'll be fine over here watching you.  which brings me to a puzzling topic.  especially after mulling over it a bit.  fireworks.  they just don't make a lot of sense to me.  i'm pretty sure it was apu from the simpsons that once clarified my sentiments.  he was making a sales pitch for quickie-mart brand fireworks.  it went, ' show your love for your country by blowing up a small portion of it! '  apu, i cherish your innocence and applaud your blatant honesty.  when i recited the quote to one of my friends, she replied with an equally valid argument: ' but it's pretty... '  so today's my last day here in the US.  i leave for indonesia (which is where my parents were born) at the stroke of midnite.  i'm sure i can make some sort of cinderella-esque joke, but i shan't.  i'm not very fond of going to indonesia.  on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being hate and 10 being love, i'd say i'm at about 2 2/5.  let's see...  pros: - labor laws (or lack thereof) make for intensely low prices on everything - piracy has yet to be totally outlawed - the food is terrific  cons: - it's always hot and humid - the mosquitos are big enough to pick a fight with a dog and win - my family members, though loving, are annoying as hell - i apparently look like a popular taiwanese pop star so the comments are endless - the food is way too terrific to agree with my diet  i could stretch both lists on for longer.  i think that's enough whining for now, though.  anyways, the last and ultimately most important pro has got to be that i get to see my aunt again.  she was deported 6 months ago for reasons i've yet to understand.  at some points in my life, this aunt was the only thing i had going for me.  i expect any and all of the english skills she acquired in the years she lived in the US to be majorly deteriorated.  talking to her ought to be extremely interesting.  i'll be back on the 13th weighed down by gifts and 10 extra pounds of body fat.  so i'll try my best to keep updating from whatever computers i'll end up at way off in the rainforests of indonesia.  ---Goei---

      today was pretty much a blur.  not the kind of blur where everything goes fast, mind you.  the kind of blur that's more like a haze because in reality, quite the opposite occured.  nothing happened today.  i sat here subtracting points from my 'healthy and active' scorecard and transcribed them to my 'computer geek' scorecard.  i never got hungry, so i didn't eat until sundown.  that's when my mom got back after an extended stay in indonesia.  she clearly has a heightened sense of tolerance when it comes to equatorial climates; i spent one week there, and she added another month on to her stay totaling at 5 weeks of blistering sun and muggy nights.  my record was 4 weeks, set a few years back, and even in that duration, i couldn't get used to the weather.  that shouldn't be such a surprise to you people though; you know how i loathe the beach in both a physical and psychological way.  oh, i'd heartily choose the frigid cold over any tropical holiday.  it's too bad there are never any blizzards here in southern california.  i'm still hoping that if i drive my car around enough, i'll pollute the environment enough to trigger a massive advance in global warming, shifting wind currents and altering the drifting patterns of certain north atlantic icebergs, provoking an acclerated rate of polar reversal.  then i can make a snow angel.  ---Goei---

      wow it's been over a week since i last posted.  umm.  sorry.  anyhow, the friend i usually take to norm's left on saturday morning for cancun, so we ended up going on friday night, with many more teenage kids than should be allowed to collaborate.  the third location was santa monica this time; we decided to pick one of the easier/closer spots this time, for the sakes of our guests.  our server, darlene, was a very conversational person, but in reality, not a very good waitress.  i don't blame her too much; she was probably nervous because i had a video camera taping our visit.  which brings me to my new ' thing ' : i carry around a video camera a lot now.  it's just for fun.  plus it seems like things are funnier when you play them back later on.  i think in ten years or so, everyone will watch my pile of tapes and envy my stupid ideas.  other than those two things, not much has been going on.  i guess that's my excuse for not posting for a while.  summer starting to slow down.  the other day i realized that we are already in august.  needless to say, i was saddened; in 3 short weeks i start up again with school.  i'm taking 3 AP classes, an above-AP honors class, and i've got to finish off my summer reading books, if by ' finish ' you mean ' start and finish '.  and on top of that, i've got to start regulating my body clock.  if i keep up with my nocturnal schedule, i'll probably feel like crap and look it too after the first week or two.  it's been a long day, and i'm expecting to crash any moment now.  goodnite everyone.  ---Goei---

      i was never very good at lazy sunday afternoons.  i haven't a clue why not; they seem to be what i'm always asking for: a quiet day with no distractions.  but there's something in me that wants something to happen.  something wrong possibly.  call it self-sabotage, a moth to a flame, whatever.  maybe i just enjoy complaining.  meh.  goei is goei.  last night i took a quick road trip with my friend to riverside.  the drive was a little over an hour going at least 80 the whole way, which is what i did.  normally you wouldn't be able to go that fast; you see, the traffic is horrible because there's a huge outlet a few miles past riverside.  but we started at around 9PM, so all the stores were closed and the only traffic was going opposite us on the freeway.  riverside is only on the map because there's a u.c. school there, aptly titled U.C. Riverside.  The thing is, we spent about 2 hours driving around there, and not once did i see a river or any other body of water for that matter.  false advertisment.  i think i'll write a letter of complaint to the mayor of riverside.  i can picture it now: ' dear mr. riverside... '  anyways, we were in riverside because it was the farthest norm's location in southern california.  and in case you don't know, our plan is to visit every norm's on the south side of california.  sounds wonderfully stupid doesn't it?   irony alert! : our quest for  norm's  is anything but  normal .  once you boil it down, we drove an hour and used half a tank of gas to buy 2 cups of coffee and a hot chocolate in a town whose name is horrendously misleading.  and the kicker: once we got the check, our waitress wrote us a cheerful little message...                ' come again!  '.  oh i bet we got more than our fair share of sideways glances, because we couldn’t stop laughing after seeing that.  so, yesterday and the week before puts 2 locations down on our list and 15 more to go.  if you asked me why we're doing this, i couldn't tell you and remain seemingly sane to the general public.  that's ok though, life's more fun when people think you're crazy.  ---Goei---
