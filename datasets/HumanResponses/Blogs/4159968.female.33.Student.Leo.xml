						       Well its Saturday afternoon.  I had contractors show up this morning to give me am estimate on painting the upstairs rooms.... they decided they could start immediately.  So they did.  The girls are not exactly thrilled to have 2 strange males in the house... and since its still drizzling Mys is pacing back and forth from the door to the chair unable to settle.  They will be mostly done tomorrow... which is cool... but dang ... now I have so much to do and am still stumped ... have my bed that is still not here.. still have no mattresses for it... still ahve to get the carpet in...   I know its a never ending battle but a respite would be nice.

						   Today was wonderful.  I do not think the kitchen has been that clean since before my back was hurt.  He kept checking on me making sure I was not needing anything as he worked. He fixed a meal I could eat... and enjoy.  Served it to me and kept the girls entertained while I ate.   I am thinking it maybe time for a small playsession for reward for his attentive hard work.  Maybe something can be worked for next week.  Would like to have one room avaiable... so no sooner than the end of next week.  Already thinking about what we can do for the play.

						       Heh what the hell I am doing up at this hour I will never know.  Partial excitement and anticipation, partial pain. My jaw still hurts from the dentist.  And my neck and back are giving me arguments also.  *sigh* even my ribs ache.  I am excited that my sub will be here today.  He is going to cook dinner.  I think he is going to clean the kitchen too *sigh* poor thing its a mess and a half.  Will see how things go.

						        I was talking to another domme friend of mine the last few days.  She thinks I am a bit unconventional since I am not into the intense CBT and humiliation she is =p. Funny I thought those of us in this lifestyle would be more tolerant of others... you have your kink I have mine and if they are the same cool, if not cool.  Lol guess that is one reason I did not get along so well with many I have met since I am tolerant of others.   She is a very very sweet lady... who uses her subs like paper... literally... she has never shown any concern for them at all.   She will only play with those who show great tolerance for pain and humilitaion.  The others she allows to clean her house, do her shopping, run errands, etc... with never even a word of praise or thanks.  And she is the one with 20+ subs lined up at any one time... I used to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Was I too nice to be a domme.  Should I learn to humiliate and do the intense CBT.  Should I change who I was? I decided NO.  I am not that person.  In a scene I can do the humilation (some) and I do enjoy light CBT.  But I decided much the same thing in my vanilla relationships as I did in these...  I have always believed that everything we have endured in our life makes us the person we are today.  If we do not like that person then we can change ourselves.  If we do... why change.  Others will like us or not... but what is important is that we like us.      I have been asked why I did not have more subs.  #1 I cannot devote my time and energy to more than 1 at a time.  And to me it would be doing a disservice to the sub (who is a person) to do any less than devoting myself to the relationship.  #2 The subs in the area have not been interested in service really.  They are only intersted in what I can do for them.  And the ones I talked to were into the rougher stuff than I am.  And #3 They wanted to play the very first time we met.  I have to meet someone and get to know them before I can even consider to play with them. lol ok enough fractured stuff atm =p lol more later

						       Since I have had a fun day thanks to the local dentist this may be a bit fractured.     I confess I am in a bit of a shock.  To have found a sub who loves to pamper and care for you is heaven indeed.   I profess I was disappointed that he was unable to do the things he thought he would Sunday.  But he did seem to take things in stride and adapt well to a day of relaxation for me.

						   *smile* what can I say. Friday was one of the most relaxing fun days I have had in a long time. Although I think he felt he was a star in a comedy of errors. After my last blog he asked if we could talk on the phone. I found that talking to him was very easy. He managed to follow my jumps in topic and converstation. Friday *chuckle* I do not know which was more amusing. The fact that nothing seemed to go exactly right for him or his reactions. I literally laughed more than I have in a long time. He was attentive, courteous, lol and amusing. He arrived a bit early lol and proceeded to win the girls over. I finished getting ready and we headed out. First I forgot the sketches that had the measurements for the cabinets we were checking on. Then we get to Home Depot to see what was available and find that the truck has a flat. So we head back to the house to drop that truck off. When we return to the house, he offers to drive. So off we go. First we go the wrong direction lol but I have never seen a vehicle that could not turn around. So we head off again. Lol there were a lot of little things that seemed set on frustrating him.. lol and tickling me.  Even the stops we made... things always went a bit off. A store that almost always carries what I went for was out... lol things like that.  We returned to my house. I have to admit I was still a bit apprehensive. Probably because we are still in this getting to know you stage and its awkward and annoying=p. But I think things went amazingly well.

						   Well this has definately been a most interesting few days. I had pretty much taken myself out of the scene locally. I was tired of "boys" coming to me looking for a way to redeem themselves for wanting to engage in what basically amounted to an affair and caused me to feel more used than a $2 whore... something like a piece of meat. They would tell me they had no limits but when asked about their wife (as in did she know he was negotiating with a domme or even looking into it) they would eventually admit they were not telling them. They were constantly comparing the dommes they did play with and if you did not "measure up" in an area you could be sure all the subs would not approach you to play in that area. The dommes were giving the impression like the entire scene was a competition. Who could play with the most "boys" or who could make the most "boys" safe out. Most of the dommes treated the "boys" as if they were interchangeable and disposeable. Whether these two attitudes fed on each other or not ... it was not something I could deal with on a constant basis. So I left. With my husband out of the country and all the added stresses... I felt that was one I could drop. I left my personal information on 2 sites and stayed on the discussion group but I stopped attending fucntions and gatherings. I am not a one time play partner. I like being able to get to know someone. Over the last year of low activity from me, I have gotten maybe 5 contacts via these sites. None panned out when they learned I had not done cyber domme and did not want a cyber slave. So when another email came in from someone with dom in their name ... well, honestly, I figured it was another crack pot wanting to tell me that women were not made to dominate but instead to be dominated (yes I got about 3 of those a week when I was active). Imagine my surprise when within 3 emails I found an intelligent, funny man who already had made me laugh. He was appropriate in his greetings without being simpering. And he peaked my interest. We began conversing on im and I doubt I have laughed that much in my life. Even for being a smart ass he is hilarious. We can talk as friends and that is a huge bonus to me. We managed to meet ... and I was impressed. I was almost afriad I would have to go into big bad domme mode for the entire time but instead I was able to relax and be myself. Something I prefer greatly anyway since I already wear enough masks. First impressions? well for some reason the word imp pops into my head. Mischevious. But not flighty. It is hard to describe what was going through my head at the end when we decided we would like to try to get together. I was flattered that I made such an impression I suppose. Then despite myself the worries set in. I have been through a lot in life and most of it was caused by males umm well basically lying to me. I subconsciously made the decision to give it a few days and see if the attitude changed. I suppose I have been expecting it to, and it has not. He is still as interesting and fun and I have to stop making things so hard. Today on the drive home I ran over many things in my head. I think I was worried because I do not have a real playroom set up yet... have to deal with the dogs 99% of the time... am not as experienced in varied things... and had to admit to myself that I was just as nervous about the first time as he probably would be. Ok this is getting too fractured... time for a break..

						      I got hit with a major case of the lazies.  Heh even doing the dishes has been too much trouble for me the last 2 days.  So the bedroom is still not finished, the dishes are not done, and the house is still not cleaned.   Have been unable to carry a thought long enough to write lol when I get lazy I get totally and completely lazy =p     In the one burst of energy I found I managed to learn how to finish some slideshows I was working on.  Now I just have to find the music to go with them and program them into the website... lol might be done this week.

						        Sunday was my 33rd birthday.  Mom had asked me to come down to her house and spend the night Saturday night.  Her church was having a gathering Sunday morning and a singing so she thought I would enjoy that.  Drew and Cat had both said the previous week that they would come and watch the dogs Saturday night.  Drew called Friday to say he had lost his drivers liscense and was going to check the 4 places it could be and was not sure when he would make it down.  To me this sounded like he was still coming. So I figured things were ok.  I left Saturday about 1:30 headed to mom's.  We had a great time.  Sitting on the dock and watching the water skiiers.  Grandmom fried fresh fish for all and we had a good dinner.   Mom had even gotten me a birthday cake for Sunday and one of my sisters had her family were coming too.  About 7pm I called home to check on things.  (note... only reason I worry about my dogs is my closest neighbor hates dogs and shot one recently)  There was no answer.  I called cat to make sure she was still planning on heading to my house and got no answer.  I was not really concerned yet.  At 9 pm I tried again.  Still noone at my house.  I called Cat again.  She informed me that she had been drinking and had forgotten she was supposed to be there.  So I start trying to track down Drew and find out if he was on the way or what.  These poor puppies had not been able to go outside for 12 hours at this time.  After trying to reach someone for 3 hours I gave up and started home.  *sigh* so 3 hours sleep friday night... 240 miles and 6 hours of driving.  My back hated me so when I finally got home Sunday morning at 3am I let the girls out, cleaned up their messes, notified everyone I had made it back safely and began my pain management techniques to help my back.      I was more than mad... My mom and I do not have the greatest relationship anymore and the fact the visit was going so well was wonderful for me... then to have to cut it short because my friends could not keep their word... I was pissed.    Finally managed to crash around 5... and I get a call at 8 am.   A sub I have been watching out for had another crisis.  He is trying to live on his own in a new town and feeling very vulnerable and alone.  So he calls and talks and talks and talks.  He is trying to deal with the fact there is less of a availability of dommes where he is and so he has been trying vanilla relationships and they have been driving him up the wall.  *sigh* so I am confidant, dating counselor, lol damn and support group for him at this time.  I have never met a person who had almost no condience in themself at all... not in any of their abilities or anything.  He is totally self defeating and will not even try to see the abilities he has.    So after talking to him for a while Sunday morning I was wired and bored =p.  So I start surfing and went shopping some to umm raise my spirits =p.  Finally broke down and bought the cupping set I have been looking at, a new paddle, and a few other neat nifties.    Matt called and we got to talk for quite a while.  He is definately ready to get a break from the sand and heat of Kuwait.  We talked over some of the plans we have for his leave when he returns.  And the possible CA christmas trip.  I am trying to work out a surprise for him to go to a Jethro Tull concert in November.  The logistics are fun.  But he loves tull so it would be cool.   ok this is longer and more rambling than I had intended... so enough for now

						   lol what a ungodly time of the morning.  I am NOT a morning person.  But mom has asked that I come down to spend the night with them.  I will miss the girls.   I do not like being separated from my dogs.  And mom will not allow dogs inside =p so they will stay here.

						       I have always believed that the choices and experiences we have throughout our life make us the person we are today.  I may have been through hell a few times, but it gave me unique and different outlooks on life.      Someone today asked me why I became a domme.  I do not believe that is a simple answer.  Then again I do not choose to label myself a domme all the time.  I am a naturally dominating person.  Does this mean I want a 24/7 slave... no... I like being able to have heated discussions with people... I like being able to disagree with them... and not have them just roll over and give up.  I run into so many misconceptions about dominates in general.  And I know up to a few years ago if a woman said she was a domiante she was seen as an outcast, or a freak.  The location I live in today is still that way (baring certain circles).  Strong women of any type are looked down on and ostracised.  I have been saddled with the name QueenBitch for years simply because I would not back down to the men in my life and work.  I have seen some dommes who went out of their way to be overly cruel because that is what they thought they had to do.  I thought acknowledging my dominate side would free me in a way.  Allow me to explore the side of me that always seemed present.      But my question is... am I?     In reality being dominate has done little but cause me problems in many ways.  My first marriage was ruined because of many things.  One of which was I was not enough of a saidst for him (started as a vanilla marriage).  It wars with the ideals I was brought up with.  A woman is to be ladylike, meek and mild.  Submitting to her mate at least in public and letting him have the lead.  A woman's place is the home and her job is to care for her family.  If she works, she is to put aside the things she wants to do to still care for home and family.  Although I have never had a sub clean etc for me... its not something that would cross my mind.  If he volunteered or did it without being told, I would accept it.  But I am still warring with those ingrained ideas. And now I am constantly approaced by subs who ... at least give the impression...want to be used, but never perform service or really be dominated... hmm that does not sound right.  Most I have been aproached by seem to want to top from the bottom... they do not give the impression of being willing to release that control.       I have seen many dommes who seemed to want to play with as many subs as they could.  For me at least there has to be some connection... and I have to be able to talk to them ... as a real person.   I am not one for notches in my flogger handle.       I have never done much online... except looking at reference sites.  I just cannot get into the sensations and playing online... Even in vanilla realationships its not something I have been able to get into.  I am much more a tactile person and its something I have not really explored.      Rofl I had one dom tell me I could not be a domme cause I liked giving oral ... lol god that started a discussion that he came out loser in =p but maybe wiser.  I love to learn new things... and very few things would I say out and out no to.  I am usually willing to try something, provided I can do it safely for my partner.     Lol ok time to go lose my mind in more games.

						   I have fought and fought over starting a blog.   But I have started to realise that this may be the best format for me at this time.  Today is 2 days before my 33rd birthday.  Although I am a bit of a troll and love my alone time, I am starting to get tired of spending ALL important days alone.  Well ok not alone, I do have my dogs.  But they are hard to have good conversations with =p.   With the most important person in my life thousands of miles away again things around here get rough at times.  I am a very self sufficient person, used to being seen as powerful and strong, but not feeling that way at this time.  I am hoping this will not become a lesson in frustration lol so am ending it for now since that is all I feel at this time.
