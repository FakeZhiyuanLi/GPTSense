      Another day cometh.  I didn't run up the mountain this morning. As always I felt like sleeping rather than running. This might've something to do with the fact that I didn't go to sleep before 2 o'clock in the morning, or it might be the fact that I'm a lazy FotherMucker. Although I would put my money on the first one. Soon I'm going to mow the lawn, which has grown to a massive length so that should be fun... yeah. Man it's boring here! I want to play tennis so much (this seems to be my new passion)! And this craving was only fueled when I found a very pro racket in the garage. It even had pro in it's name: Skillbuilder Pro. So I can't wait to do some damage with it, if my dad let's me borrow it that is. And I can only play tennis in Mosjoen! Arrgh! Damn you Korgen for your lack of tennis-courts! But seeing as I'm going there next week, all I have to do is to bide my time, and think happy thoughts... Like that's ever going to happen.  I'm reading the 5th Harry Potter - book now, and I didn't get the urge to read more and more, which I did with the other books. Maybe I've outgrown them, or maybe Rowling's creativity has depleted. Well I've only read 4 chapters so it's still early to give my verdict of the book. Maybe I'll finish it this weekend. It's not like I have anything better to do... Oh! Wait a minute, there's the lawn isn't it... Darnation, ah well. Best to get it over with.  Later  Song Of The Day:  Incubus - Are You In(?)

      Or just two in this case (It's my profile-picture if you're wondering).  The one on the left is me in the first grade of Videregaaende Skole at Mosjoen. And the one to the right is me in the second grade of Videregaaende Skole @ Mosjoen. I have yet to get a decent picture of myself showing how I currently look like, but as soon as I get one, it's up on the site.  Tomorrow I'm making tortilla. Can't wait, my mouth is watering already. Think I'll try to jog my way up the mountain we live by, seeing as bikeing up there is totally out of the question!  My tummyache is over now, although I still get a few rumblings from time to time.  My little brother is home from Norway Cup now and his team lost heavily :-/. They didn't even win one match, and he got his knee hurt(again).  Well, at least he was satisfied with the scenery... All the hot chicks that is. And I know what he's talking about. Whiplash!  I got 99 problems...

      It's been a while.    I was supposed to write after I came home from the BBQ, which was on Sunday, but I wasn't in a writing-mood at all. So before I could get in a writing mood, I went back to Mosjoen on Tuesday. And it was good, because I was bored half to death here in Korgen. Back in Mosjoen, I went to play tennis for the first time in my life and it was killer! I'm going to try to play that on a regular basis now. I also went to see Spider-Man2. It was good... Not great or anything, but if you look at the movie as a whole then it was much better than the first movie. The only bummer about the trip was that last night I got a really bad tummyache. I didn't even get one wink of sleep! So I watched The Last Samurai to keep me occupied. It was very good! A tad too long, but still very good. Right now I still have a tummyache (as well as a minor headache), so you'll have to excuse me if my writing is crap. I seem to be making a lot of excuses lately... Heh.    Meh... I need to take something for my tummy.     I'll write more when I'm better!    Later!    Song Of The Day:  Bloc Party - Banquet

      Well, what I meant to write yesterday, but couldn't formulate in a decent way, was that I had gotten a haircut. Oo, big deal, you might think to yourself. But the thruth is, that before I cut my hair (very short), i had an afro(well people called me afroman so I guess it must've been true). And I had it all of last schoolyear too. So when I go to the BBQ tomorrow (*see one of the previous posts*) I expect people to be completely shocked! I hope it'll go something along the lines of: "Who the fuck is that-OMG, it's Karsten! WTF?!" And I'll just stand there and say: "Is there something wrong?" And they'll say: " OMG, man! You're all like haircutted and stufflike things!" And then I'll be all like: "So you noticed? I just took a little trim." And they'll be all like: " Wow, dawg. Yous be mad-trippin' right about now!" Nah, I'm just kidding. That was my imagination being carried away a little bit. But it should be fun though... If it's not, me and John is going to sneak off to see Spider-Man2. Which I hear is pretty good, so it's kind of a win-win situation.    My little borther is heading for Norway Cup soon. Ah, I can remeber when I was his age(actually I was one year younger if my memory isn't playing tricks on me) and went to NC...  The memories... Me scoring a goal, followed by me breaking my arm... Well at least we won the match! I hope my brother does better than me, well I know he's going to do better than me, because he is really more into this football stuff than I was. For example he is going to Idrettslinja next year, which is kind of like ordinary school just with more gym... Can't think of any equivalents to America nor Britain... SportSchool maybe?!    Right now it's very sunny outside, but a tad windy. So I think I'm going to go out for a sec.

      I have a lot to say, but I can't find a way to get it out. It's not something deep and personal I want to ay... Just ordinary everyday things. The thing is, that when I try to write it it becomes unreadable, uncoherent and basically just a piss poor reading experience...  I tried three times already to write it down, but no dice. But I wanted to write something, so this is what I came up with... Pretty dull stuff, I know, but I had to write something!    Anywho, I took one of my weekly bicycle-trips this morning. I rided up the mountain we live by, and I was scared to pieces! It was so much traffic! Trailers(trucks?) riding both up and down,  and cars coming from both directions so i had to jump into the ditch and wait until they passed! It was terrifying! But the worst part was going back down, because I couldn't hear the car's that came from behind at all. After a while I got a lot of spit in my mouth, so I turned to spit it behind me, and there came a car in full speed! I'm not sure if I my spit hit it, but there was also coming cars  in front of me, so the car behind me screeched up on the side of me and barely made it past the other car's... It was not a particularly fun trip.    Well, I'm home now, safe and sound so I think I'm going to do something safe... like the dishes!    Peace out. Karsten     Song of the day: Amulet - Danger!

      I'm writing this post for the second time, seeing as the preview-button made my first post go bye-bye.    Anyway. The weather returned to a sunny state after at least 5 days of rain, clouds and utter gloominess. I must say it was perfect for working on my non-existing tan. So I went out on the back porch(which is a brilliant song by The Presidents Of The United States Of America, that I have to remember to listen to tomorrow when i continue my tanning-work-thingy) with a good book and my 80's style sunglasses and it was utter bliss! So even if I get a tan or not, I will still continue to sit on the back porch whenever there's a sun-filled day.  Tanning doesn't come that easy to me. Why? Well I'm a brown/redhead, and I'm told that people with that kind of hair (red especially) doesn't get a tan easily. The results i tend to get is either getting sunburnt and pink, or remain in my pale state(I'm often mistaken for a corpse/vampire when I take my shirt off i.e on the beach), just with a few more freckles added to my collection. But I think that this is the summer where all of that will turn :)  Wish me luck!    As well as this project I've another one which has been going on for the last 2 weeks. Which is mainly to:  Try To Get Healthier!         So I've done a list of things to do each day/week: At least 100 sit-ups and 50 push-ups a day, Eat at least 5 fruits/vegetables a day, and take at least 3 jog/bike-trips a week. I've stuck to this list for, as I said, the last two weeks, and I plan to stick with it out the summer and hopefully when I go back to school as well.    Oof, I'm not at all as happy with this post as when I first wrote it, but what am I going to do?    Feel free to comment if you pass by my blog! It will only inspire me to write more, and maybe I'll get a chance to sneak a peak at your blog as well.    Fo' Shizzle, Karsten.

      That's the question that's been in my head this week. You see I was very confused to begin with when i put this blog up so I had to go through my list of frequently used passwords/usernames, until I finally found the right one (YAY!).    So now I'm ready to blog it up once again! What's happened recently? Hmm, I got invited to a BBQ on Saturday so that should be hella-fun, I got the newest Ash album, Meltdown, which was a bit of a disappointment really :-/. Well, I have nothing but time to let it grow on me anyway.  I've also recently "discovered" The Cure. Which means that I've always known they were there, but I've never really listened to their music. And I'm glad I started to listen to them because they make very bootyful music, that's right, bootyful.    I got a link from my cousin which was to a site where I could check out my pornname.  Which is Cort Playah if you were wondering. We'll just have to see if I put that to use someday;).    Karsten

      Late night / Early morning posting in progress.  I was just out for about 10mins to show some friends around my wee homeplace. They were bored and drove here, which is about a bit under an hour, but I seriously doubt that they followed the speed-limit. My friends said they were more familiar with New York and London than they were with Korgen. Now they can say it the other way around after my superb tour. "There's the local store. There's the local gas-station. Knock yourselves out." Okay, maybe I'm exagerating(is that how you write it? grammar not to well toonight;)) but it's nearly as bad as I make it out to be.  I went to my grandma and grandpa to mow their lawn this afternoon, and to see their kitten. The cat we gave them for x-mas had kittens a little time ago, and they got rid of everyone of them but one. And he's the cutest little thing! I know that it might seem a bit doubtful for me to call a kitten cute, seeing as I'm a seventeen year old teenage-boy. So let's just get one thing straight: I'm str, umm... heterosexual. And in addition to that, I think kittens are the cutest things to walk this planet. I wuv 'em.  urlLink Kittens!   Eek it's late, I gotta go to bed now.  Stand-Up Show of the Night:  Pablo Fransisco @ Comedy Central  HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA!

      Ok, second time's the charm...?  I tried to post this morning but the thunder prevented me from posting or even saving what I had already typed. Well I got back to Korgen this morning after two days in Mosjoen, where I played tennis, watched TV and played tennis. I was supposed to buy my own racket so I didn't have to borrow from my friends all the time, but the one racket they had in stock at the sportshop was waaaaay too expensive for me. I however got another racket ordered which will be at a nicer prize. Can't wait till i get my paws on it next week, or maybe I should say the week after next week, because you know what happens next week don't you? Oya-festivalen, baby! Yeah! This weekend I'm going to chill because the festival will be maximum stress. Me and my bro will have to run between scenes to get to see the bands we want to see, but it will all be in good fun... I hope.  My friend went to London today(or should I say yesterday?) and he's going to get me one of those "My friend went to..." t-shirts. Woohoo. Does fake enthusiasm show in typing? Not that that 'woohoo' was spawned in fake enthusiasm or anything... Heh.  There's the kid with the golden arm / He admits to forest fire That started off from the lack of / Something better going on.  I'm not sure if my way of showing that this is a song lyric is correct but anyway, that's taken from my favorite-song at the moment, which will appear(yet again) in Song Of The Day.

      Ah, could yesterday have been more fun??  Let me fill you in on what went down. When I woke up(pretty early) I went to the store to buy dinner, where I meet a friend that I hadn't spoken to in almost one year to the dot. We talked for a while, and then we decided to go to the beach after he'd finished work. So we went there, myself , my friend, and three others. I got a few jokes on behalf of my blindingly white skin, but I just laughed with them. I hadn't been to the beach in about 2 years before I went yesterday, and it was certainly about time! The water had a good temperature as well. So we threw some american football, frisbee and we did a little volleyball too... All in the water of course. Then we just sat down talking for the last 45mins. When we were done we went to my old school where they have a sandvolleyball-setup. At first I sucked pretty miserably, but I got a lot better after a while, and I got a whole new perspective on volleyball. Which is that it's actually fun! But as always when I play volleyball, I got an injury. In stead of one of my thumbs which is usually most likely to get hurt, my left bigtoe was roughed up a bit. So I'm hoping that it'll recover for when I'm going to play tennis today.  My parents came home from their vacation last night. They thought I'd been very good with watering the plants(!) and they brought me two killer t-shirts as a present. So it was good to be home. Letterman was unbelivable last night! It was like the best episode of Letterman EVER! Well, some episodes may have had better jokes, but last night's show kept it funny throughout, which made me very happy.  I have to get ready before the bus comes now. See you when I see ya.  Song Of The Day:  Pretty Girls Make Graves - All Medicated Geniuses   Late.

      Yay! I watched The Untouchables last night, and it was, as always, great! I can't think of a better mafia-movie at the moment. Well some would say The Godfather, but in my opinion The Untouchables is better. I mean the music in that movie! It's magnificent. The 'danger'-music is truly terrifying, but I have to say the music that's entitled to Al Capone is the best. It kind of reminds me of something that would feature in something Japanese, like an anime-movie or something. If I ever was to make a movie I would definitively have Ennio Morricone do the score. But what are the odds of that happening?  I've been following Paradise Hotel the last few weeks, and it's at the end now. I haven't seen too much of the first ten-or-so episodes, but I knew enough to keep up with what was happening. Right now there seems to be a lot of trouble in Paradise, seeing as the people that had been 'voted' off the show, came back and they've watched all the episodes of the show to see who's been going behind who's back. It's so much fun! They're arguing like crazy, and there was even a threat of physical violence! "I'll come visit you in Arizona when your brother moves there... with about 50 guys." Oo that Zack sure is a rough customer. I don't know what it is about reality-shows, but once you've watched around 3 episodes you just have to know what happens next! And by 'you' I mean me. But it's fun to be the only one in your class watching some stupid reality-show. Last year I talked a lot of shit about a show called "Singel 24/7". And I was the only one watching it! No one else I've talked to since that show started/ended, has watched it. It's crazy... Or maybe I'm crazy?  I stood up early today to clean a bit. My older brother is coming home for a short while, and the house was really messy, so I had to take action. And if you ask me, I think I did a fairly decent job.  I think I have to do a countdown for me going to the Oya-Festival in Oslo. It's only 9days until I get my ass on a train down there! I got butterflies already! I'm going to see The Streets, Velvet Revolver(I've only heard one song with them but I think it should be good... if I don't like the performance, at least the ambience will be rawk'n'rawl) and Span among manymanymany bands. It'll be 4 days of music and it's a fair upgrade from my first festival last year which was Norwegian Wood. Me and my buddy John went there to see Audioslave which was pretty frikkin awesome. We were right in the middle of the mosh-pit with a perfect view of the stage. I hope I have an experience like that at this year's festival. I think Velvet Revolver and The Streets will be my best bet... Maybe Span as well.   9 Days and counting....  Song Of The Day: Phantom Planet - Big Brat         You're alwaaaaays up to noooo good!
