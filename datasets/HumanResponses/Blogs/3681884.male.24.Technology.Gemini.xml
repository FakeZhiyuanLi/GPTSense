       If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!   This movie was a disappointment, but that's not to say that I didn't enjoy myself.  In fact, I really enjoyed it.  What's not to love with Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, Gary Cole, and Jason Bateman.  This movie seemed like a remake of Baseketball, right down to the disgusting tongue-filled kiss at the end.  Two and half stars out of five.

      Nothing interesting here, but I did feel like I should memorialize my first audio post.    urlLink

      AOPA Online is running a story called  urlLink New noise standards hurt safety, small businesses .  There is truly a new regulation under review that would require new aircraft to be quieter than lawnmowers.  I don't need to tell you how ridiculous this is.  This gets lumped into the same ridiculous pile as "Two Foot N Numbers."  For those of you who don't know, an N number is the aircraft identification number unique to each aircraft.  All aircraft in the United States begin with N.  For example, the aircraft I soloed in for the first time was N968SP.  Anyway, a group of concerned citizens wanted to put two foot high N numbers on the underside of general aviation aircraft so that they could identify noisy aircraft and sue the pilots.  Hey, I got a tip for you folks.  If you don't like the sound of small planes, don't build your house at the end of  urlLink Westchester County Airport's Runway 34 .  If these folks had their way, half the airports in this country would be shut down, and then they'd wonder why it suddenly takes three weeks to their  Sex and the City  box set shipped out to their place in the Hamptons.

      Okay, so I watched Dateline NBC and there was a story called,   urlLink Moore defends incendiary film  .  Now, I usually roll my eyes and tune out when this man opens his mouth, but I was real bored so I continued to watch even after he appeared on screen.  For this reason, I decided long ago that I wouldn't go see his new documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11.  The concept alone sounded vulgar.  Somewhere in the interview, they showed a clip from the film that was actually a clip from a news interview of Bush on vacation making an ass of himself.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I totally agree with the invasion of Iraq.  But Bush really annoys me, and Moore stated in the interview that although he's a film maker first, the film is a personal attack on Bush and his policies.  That has made me rethink seeing his film.  Seeing this film may end up really annoying me, but the man has peaked my curiosity.

      Okay, so this is what happens when I have too much time on my hands.  I blame  urlLink Trey Givens , who inspired me to start a blog.  What happened?  The office was closed.  My peers were all out in Southampton.  My sinuses were clogged.  I had no where to go and nothing to do.  I cancelled tomorrow's flight because my health and the weather was in question, and so I write.  I can't help but imagine that this is the beginning of something wastefully time consuming.

       urlLink Trey Givens  is musing about how  urlLink The Daily Show has a liberal slant .  Now, I use to watch The Daily Show... daily--that is, until I got rid of my satellite dish.  I loved it the show.  It's hilarious.  Do they have a liberal slant?  Well, as I pointed out to Dr. Givens, most of hollywood is liberal.  It's disgusting.  But they do tend to just make fun of whoever is in the news, in office, or just screwing up in general.  Right now, that's GeeDubya.  Dr. Givens contends that the "liberal fake media" makes jokes at the expense of legitimate concerns and truth.  This is true.  It wouldn't be funny if were about something trivial.  But is this a problem?  I don't think so.  It should be taken as a joke and nothing more.  It's not like The Daily Show is a legitimate news source.

      Okay, so that sucked.  Apparently I wasn't completely over my illness and as a result, I became ill  during  my flight.  I made it out to  urlLink Montauk  despite of my severe bouts of nausea and dizziness, but I had to ditch the rest of the day and head back.  It's really too bad.  The water was a beautiful deep blue, the breeze was cool and the sun was warm.  I don't think I could have asked for a better day.

      I had an amusing pair of phone calls today:    Matt:  Hello?   Saleswoman:  Hi! Could I speak with your IT director?   Matt:  What is this regarding?   Saleswoman:  This is regarding offsite storage of your data backup tapes.   Matt:  Oh, no thank you.   *click*   ...   *thirty seconds later*    Matt:  Hello?   Saleswoman:  Hi! Could I speak with  *name omitted* ?   Matt:  What is this regarding?   Saleswoman   coping an attitude  :  As I said a minute ago, this is about the offsite storage of your data backup tapes!   Matt:  Well, I'm very sorry, but  *name omitted*  is the president of the company and he does not deal directly with that sort of thing.   Saleswoman:  Well, could you tell me who in your organization  would  handle that?   Matt:  The IT director would be more appropriate.   Saleswoman   becoming very impatient  :  Well, could you tell me who that person is?   Matt:  Sure.  Matt Chancellor.   Saleswoman:  Could I speak with him?   Matt:  Speaking.   Saleswoman   sighs heavily    *a moment of silence*    Saleswoman   very annoyed  :  Bye.   *click*     I love taking sales calls.

      Okay, I'm getting a little sick of hearing from people that I'm getting screwed at work.  Okay?  Yeah, I know I'm being underpaid at the moment.  But really, there's more to a job than how much money you're getting, right?  The people I work with are great.  Well, all except the thieving CFO, but I think he learned his lesson.  If the work environment were any more relaxed, people would be having sex on the conference tables... or, dare I think it, setting cold drinks on their desks without using coasters.  I get car service, free lunches, dinner, unlimited sick and personal days, great benefits...  So, isn't it really that bad that I'm underpaid?  Yeah.
