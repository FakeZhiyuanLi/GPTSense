       urlLink An interesting and funny as hell article  from the NYT. About people's use of cellphones. No need to say much, this is something we see more and more everyday.   We seem to be getting more and more engrossed in the phone conversation and unaware of the surroundings. A sociological explanation of this phenomenon is it's a struggle between  "in" group - those on the phone - against those in the "out" group, or people in close proximity to the talkers.   Another intersting thing, what is known as the actor-observer phenomenon. Quoting James Katz, "When you see other people doing things, you think they are doing it for selfish reasons, but when you do it, you feel you are on morally high ground,"  I think most of you suffer from this phenomenon, barring myself of course.   urlLink This picture is absolutely hilarious

      Spiderman as Pavitr Prabhakar, a chap wearing dhoti. Certainly interesting, will be fun to see if they can really intergrate the story and the characters in Indian setting. Reminds me of Indrajal comics. The Times group used to publish those. That was sometime in the 80's when I used to read them. Phantom, Mandrake, Flash Gordon and an Indian hero named Bahadur. Bahadur was a karate champ. Phantom and Mandrake were my favorites, I never liked Bahadur as much. I don't know whether it was an indianized version of some other character, but it was quite well made.  It will be fun to see how Spiderman turns out.   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Spider-Man gets Indian make-over

      These days I am reading a book called the Hidden Order. It's by David Friedman, an introduction to economics for non-economists.  urlLink Quite an interesting book.     Friedman seems to be a very interesting person.  urlLink Check out his homepage    The book introduces economics through a number of everyday situations. I haven't finished reading the book yet, in fact just started, but it seems interesting. Even for someone who knows a bit of the formal economic theory.   so long till next time..

      Do kadam aur sahin- From the movie Meenaxi  -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|  Jindagi haath mila, saath chal saath mein aa, Umrabhar saath rahe hain,  Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin, Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin  Koi Suraj ki Dagar, Koi sone ka nagar, Chand ke rath pe chale jahan thahare yeh najar, Dhoop dariyaon me hain, phir safar paon me hain, Dil ka awaraa diya dusre gaon me hain, Aao chale hum wahin, Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin, Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin  Khawab dhalte hain jahan, dil pighalte hain jahan, Aao chalte hain wahin, Woh jamin door nahi, Dosti hogi wahan, Roshni hogi wahan, Oos ujaale ke liye Jal chuke lakhon diye, Ek aur hum sahin, Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin, Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin.  Kiski aawaj hain sun, Yeh naya saaj hain sun, Kaun rehta hain sada,  Chalke dekhen to jara, Raah wiran sahi Raat sunsan sahi, Har ghadi saath rahen, Kitne gham saath sahen, Thode gham aur sahin,  Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin Do kadam aur sahin, do kadam aur sahin.  -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|  Music : A.R. Rahman Sung by: Sonu Nigam Lyrics by Rahat Indori  -|-|-| My Verdict: 4 THUMBS UP
