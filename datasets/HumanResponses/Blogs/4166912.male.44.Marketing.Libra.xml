       urlLink Index of Leather Fashion Coats, Jackets, Blazers, shirts for Men from Discount Leather Mart   I guess it's just one of those days. I was up late last night...phone calls about problems starting at 5:30AM today. I'm looking forward to just updating info on the site this weekend. Suppose to be cooler, and I hope to get out and do some household chores now that it's not 100+  Had great fresh halibut caught by a friend who when fishing in Alaska last night. Buttered, salt, fresh crack black pepper and then barbequed over high heat. MMM! hard to bead the flavor of that.

       urlLink Discount Leather Mart, QUALITY Leather Motorcycle and Clothing , Jackets, Pants, Coats & More   So here I am again. Here is some neat info: I advertise heavily on google. About $3K a months worth of advertising. Now if you know how this works, I have ads on the right hand side of the google search page, or in the AOL Search area or a lot of other areas. When someone thinks they want to give my site a try, they click on the ad. Voila! Google Charges me whatever I said I would pay for that keyword. This is anywhere from $0.25 to $1.00 per click. NO GUARANTEE  that anyone will buy anything, but I pay.  Let me say that I've gotten lots of good sales from using this, so I can't knock the concept, but, sometimes it seems like I'm paying a lot for little sales. I figured it was competitors clicking on my site to drive up cost. Figure a competitor clicks on an ad three times per day that cost me $0.60 per click. That's $1.80 per day. Per Month that's $54 per month or 2% of my ad payements. Not a killer, but $54 is $54!  Recently it has been reported that companies in India get paid $100 per month to click on competitors ads for two hours a day. They hire locals and maybe pay them half to click a certain number of hours per week.  (I've checked and found a company in Pakistan that will click one hour per day for $50 per month).  Now let's say, one or two companies are using this trick to knock competitive advertisers out of the market. Now maybe it's 5%--10%--15% of the overall ad money spent.   Google claims they have advanced technologies to spot this sort of thing, but they don't. I signed up with a service called WhosclickingWho.com. Cost $250 for six months, but within one month, I caught 4 different people clicking repeatedly on my ads and a suspected 5 more. All came through AOL which uses a single IP address for many, many users. So you can't track these people by IP address. WhosClickingWho has found a way around this..  Anyway, I've had one person click on ads an average of 3 times per day for the past 70 days. Another one averaged 2+  I've reported to Google. they say it takes 3-4 weeks to check. It's been three weeks and not word. All they will do is refund my money for those clicks.  Unethical as hell for a company to do this to another company,   but I may pay a Pakistani pretty fast if I can't get this under control. Costing me a fortune.

      Another day in the wonderful world of online business. Yes, Saturday... another work day, just like Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and all the days of the week.  I run Discount Leather Mart,  urlLink www.discount-leather.net . Oh what a long strange trip it's been and is continuing to be.  Here are some things that I hope to happen  1. I get a day off without worring about the business. 2. I sell more of the inventory that I currently have that takes up the spare bedroom and half the living room. 3. My sister-in-law will finally find responsibility and stop mooching money. 4. I finally get back into some sort of a workout routine to reduce my gut. 5. I'd love to go sailing on my boat that just eats money sitting in the water because I don't have time or money to do anything with it.  All for now, maybe more later
