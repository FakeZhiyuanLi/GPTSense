						   Man, I am absolutely bored to tears at work.  There is nothing to do, but I can't go home because I'm the boss when the boss is gone. What kind of example would that be to the new girl if I left?  But never fear, in a day or so there will be so much work I'll want to scream.  I'll be working late and on Saturdays again.  I suppose I should just suck it up and pray that it lasts, eh?  HA!  So, we're sitting in front of the TV, right?  A preview for The Notebook comes on the screen, and hubby says, "I'm gonna take you to see that."  What?  "Well, I know you like it when I take you out, and that looks like a chick flick date movie."  Are you serious, I say.  "Yeah, I mean, it looks like something you'd get into.  Pick a day, it'll be fun."  Whoa..what just happened?  Now, don't get me wrong, I have the greatest husband on the planet.  I could not ask for a better man; honestly he's perfect for me!  It's just that...well...it just...it's uncharacteristic of him.  It's not even that he's not romantic; it's mostly that he just doesn't take initiative.  So, this weekend, hubby is taking me out for dinner and a (hopefully) romantic movie.    I don't even usually get into super chick stuff, but what woman doesn't like to be occasionally wined and dined?  It'll be nice to go out with him on my arm.  We are both pretty anti-social people; we avoid people and crowds in particular at all costs.  But when I'm with him, I feel invincible.  He is truly the greatest husband on the planet.  We usually both prefer sitting on the couch at home:  talking, reading, wathching TV or rented videos, surfing or studying.  We are both happy with this, but sometimes it's fun to get out and do something.  Speaking of which, we've both been dying to take the bikes out for a ride, but this weather has just been miserable.  Rain, rain, rain...  I thought we needed it, but now the news is saying that farmer's corn crops are flooding.  So, away with the rain!!! Let the farmers have their corn, and let us have our bike rides!  Ok, ok, the little bit of work I have left is beckoning me...

						   As my description so eloquently states, I have an opinion about everything...most people do.  And, in my own mind, my opinions are usually "right".  I find it difficult to believe, at times, that people are not always able to see eye to eye with me.  I mean, doesn't everyone see things the way I do?  (read:  the way they ought to!)  The answer is a resounding NO!  Why?  Well, because some people are uninformed and/or deluding themselves.  But, a more common reason, and I am sure many will agree with me, is that I am not always right.  Nor am I always educated and informed in my opinions.  Case in Point:  The (undeclared) Vietnam War.  Opinion:  We should have never been there.  (The "we" here being the United States.)  Reason:  Because it's true.    Now, what is wrong with that picture?  My reason is really no reason at all; it's more a weak excuse for refusing to educate myself enough to name a good reason for my belief!  Follow me?  Now, I must be brutally honest with myself...I know nothing, that's right-nothing!, about the Vietnam War.  I'm not old enough to  have witnessed any of it firsthand, and I am old enough not to have a proper excuse for not knowing more.  In the past, I have simply spouted off things that I have heard others say.  It has been mere rhetoric spewing from my lips.    I did some digging today, studying the Vietnam War - mainly the causes of it and reasons for people against U.S. involvement.  And you know what?  I now have a tentative belief that we should not have been there.  But!, that is not my final opinion.  I read a few articles that made me feel that our involvement in the VW was unnecessary and unfounded.  (Don't get me wrong, I am not one of those people who bashes troops for government decisions.  I totally support the troops.)  However, I plan to do more digging, because I did read some things that gave me pause and made we want to understand more.    Perhaps my opinion will not change, and perhaps it will.  But either way, rest assured that my opinion will have an educated and informed foundation.
