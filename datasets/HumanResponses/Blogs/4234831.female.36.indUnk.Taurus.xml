      Last night was interesting.  I was kind of nervous going with out s.  Not because I was nervous about spending time along with MG but because then I was soley responsible for his needs with no back up.  YIKES.  I think I did ok though.  I certainly didnt spill anything this time.  Thats always a good start.  Nice to see MS J and C&a and the rest.  Nice to be somewhere with out Steven.  I didnt have to worry about him harrassing me or sticking his boot in my kidney.  Playing with MG in the fashion that we did is new.  New but good.  That particular play session cleared out some old shit.  Thats a good thing.  We will definately be playing on a whole new level.  I have growen and matured some, I had better control over my emotions in regart to the teasing of "breaking her in right".  The teasing just didn't rattle me like it use to.  Interesting developement.

      I guess I will start with the easy stuff.  I didn't expect to see LD last night, kind of weird.  But I do have to say that I handled it beautifully!  Its getting easier to be at the munches, not so foreign anymore.  Sugar said last night that I need to tone down my playfullness, agian with the comment that I am to full of myself.  I am starting to feel offended by these comments.  I know she is trying to help me, really I do.  But I don't know how to be anyone other than who I am.  I feel like my mouth isn't half as smart as it use to be, and I listen alot more.  Sure there is room for improvement,but shouldn't I be myself around MG and s?  I guess if I dig a little deeper there is a fear of losing my identity, but its really not a major concern.  My major concern right now is this new assignment thats been throwen my way.  I have never had to find a place for a meeting thats free, and discloses this type of information.  But I do beleive I am capable of doing it.  My concern is time factor.  Desert Birk pays for my time 50 hours a week, I have a marriage that deserves attention with a husband that is going through a very ruff time, my store is moving in just over 4 weeks, and now I will have MAST commitments, not to mention anything MG wants or needs and the time and effort going into training.  Something might break, thats alot.  Do I really have time for the MAST commitment with my new commitment to MG and my training to be a slave?  I know I can do all of the above individually very well, but can I do all of them very well with out one or more suffering?  I am looking forward to going to the party tonight.  I think its been a year or more since I have been to a real play party.  I haven't done any type of scene since befor January so I am hoping that MG will take that into concederation.  I am anxious to play with him and build up my tolerence so that I can make him a good play partner.  Its just been a long time.

      Well last night was interesting.  At least now I have some rules and know what is expected as far as checking in etc.  Having a struggle with MG changing the time on the clock.  That just really bugs me.  Why would he do such a thing?  He can beat me for no reason what so ever, why do something so unfair?  Then agian is it really unfair if he is getting his kicks from it and it pleases him?  Ugh!  I knew he had changed the time, but how do you say that respectfully with out strangeling him?  Balance, its all about balance! Then there is the whole name thing.  Double Ugh! I have to remember to look up the word hughty in the dictionary.  There is a difference between confident and huaghty.  I wish I could have communicated my point more clearly.  I was fusturated that no one seemed to be listening to me.  Yet I know that MG does listen to every word.  Hate the whole name thing and very unhappy with it.  Of course I will do it, of course I will earn my rightful name back, and of course MG got exactly what he wanted.  He wanted to get under my skin and make a point, mission acomplished.  I am severly bugged.  Thats it for now.  Seeing Chip tonight, looking forward to seeing him.  He is becoming a really good friend.

      Yahoo!! I got an extra day off this week! See what hard work will get you? Looking forward to hooking up with MG, its really hard to get in the slave mindset with out any peramitors. I just need to know whats expected. Have to remember to tell him about the bed and breakfast weekend with Bob. Not sure how I put that on my schedule. Thats it for today, nothing new.

      I can't beleive it!!  I didn't even make it 24 hours with out screwing up!  I don't remember saying I would call on Saturday, and MG's conversation on the phone was very reminisint of LD.  I hope we get some time this week to actually get my contract signed and expectations layed out.  I am flying completly blind here with just enough rope to hang myself with!  Going to have to take some time for meditation daily until I get things in more of a balance.  Very glad shoe show is over and order writting is over.  Mentally I am exhausted!  Have to call the supper about the hot water.

      Nothing new to report this morning.  I am looking forward to starting training, I think that will releive some of the nerves.  Meditated last night in an effort to just calm down.  Have to get back to the slave mindset and thats been hard.  Switching gears from slave one night and wife next morning has been interesting.  I think I can balance the both, just need to practice more. Something s said in the car has been needling my brain.  She said we had to get back to more formal protocal.  I know with the compitition coming up that would be a necessity.  But was she thinking it because I hadn't acted appropriately friday night?  Was I her reminder? I am worried about the compitition. Will I be ready?  Will my actions and service survive scutiny?  I would really like to see them win this time.  I know last time I did a pretty good job, but what can I improve on this time?  How can I enhance s's appearance as the alpha?  I do agree with s that its going to be good not to have Steven carting them around.  MG is more than capable of introducing and mingling with anyone.  The group as a whole needs to see s serving MG.  That means I really need to be invisable and way in the back ground.

      Last night I gave Denny and sugar my answer.  Boy did I jump right into the fire.  It was a tough night.  I tryed really hard to be on my best behavior,but I haven't started training yet and really don't know whats expected.  I know that I didn't expect Master G to tell everyone that night!  I don't understand why Dom's congradulate the slave?  Shouldn't they be congradulating the Master on making such a great aquisition?  I was called to serve and answered the call, truely not deserving of congratulations.  It was hard to be back at the munch, I had been under my rock for a long time.  The feel and the vibe of the munch was completely different and I felt like I had to watch my back.  Not because Master G wouldn't have taken care of any problem, hell, he would probably recognize a problem befor I would.  It was just the vibe of the place, instinct just kicked in.  It was hard to say hello to everyone and keep my focus in the right place.  Plus the fact that I have been out of the loop for so long I wasn't up on all the stories and dynamics going on behind the scenes.  Most of the major players were the same faces, but I did notice a lot of new faces and I think that some of the older players that have been screwing around should be paying attention.   I am very happy to be with MG and s.  I think it was a good choice.  I am just questioning if I have the perservernce to keep up with all the crap some of these players create.  I am very worried about running into M and E.  Its been really cool to watch MG and sugars relationship change and grow, I hope my presence will only add to it.
