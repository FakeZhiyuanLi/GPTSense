        I won this employee of the month type award for June and the Director of Operations sent out a mass email recognizing me. It's no secret that I no longer am investing my 'all' into this place. So, I proceed to forward the email of recognition to one of my buddies with the sentiment "Weeeeeee. Now gimme my fucking gift certificate!" Then my vision goes a bit blurry and I feel a bit ill because I realize that I sent this email as a reply to the damn Director. I get up, without thinking, and head straight for her office. When I get there she's meeting with a couple supervisors. I, again without thinking, blurt out..."Please do not read the email I sent you, I meant to send it to someone else". She sorta has a grin like "Yeah, I'm sure there's something really incriminating in there that I could probably fire your ass for"...but says "ok, we all have done this from time to time, I'll delete it with you standing here so you can relax". Whhhew! Twenty minutes pass and she comes over with a grin and a gift certificate! I failed to acknowledge the deleted mail folder. So, I know she read it. But I honestly, don't care. I think it's funny as hell. I've told everyone I know about it. I'm not what you'd call 'discreet'. LOL!

         The loftiest altitude of I is Me.   Thus together, We are greased and pumping    like an organic turbine of emotion.      Our ideals mesh around    the gears and springs of our warm circuit boards.    Illuminated by green, yellow and red impulses.       Your delicate features have burnt an image    in the cavity behind my eyes.    I'm left with a bright projection of your beauty,    scetched in the colors of a 3-D imagination.       Without the glasses, crude and jagged lines.   Blurred and strange to my eyes.    Whymsical.    But nothing without the glasses.

         I think I'm turning into a bitter old hag and I'm only 23! I hate people and that doesn't bother me right now. I don't think it's depression. But I don't know either... I've watched that commercial with the little egg guy always under a rain cloud and it outlines depression as someone who no longer finds interest in the things they used to, as someone who doesn't want to be around loved ones and friends....etc. Both of those apply to me, but I don't necessarily feel depressed. It's more of a 'fuck it all' feeling. Numb I guess.       Also, dammit...I wore black today. I seem to be metamorphisizing into the high school me. I don't want to be angry all the time. I don't want to wear black and detach myself from everyone. But when the opportunity to be bubbly presents itself I get all evil and get that 'fuck it all' feeling. I need a daily affirmation.          Reasons why I'm not turning into a black wearing, tortured soul having, society hating Goth:         I don't cut myself with cheapo safety razors for attention.       I listen to the Cure, but not daily.       I wear pink on occasion.       I don't yet speak in perpetual monotone.        (This gothic quality of talking in a monotone voice, is always extra amusing to me. Free, no strings attached imagery compliments of me. The set up: A pasty, lanky, blackhaired kid...oh, 17 years old. Hunched over, "my dog just died a horrible death" expression. Then the scene pans out and you start to see bright, nearly obnoxious colors, then a little pinwheel hat (you know the kind)....then finally you see a name tag, a cash register and you hear him say in his painfully monotone Goth voice "Would you like fries with your Buddy Burger Combo?". I can't really describe why that particular irony is so funny too me. Whatever...I think it's funny. If I get into why then I'll be that not-funny person that tells a joke and when no one laughs (queue the crickets) I'll be all "You get it? You get it? It's like the guy walks into a bar, you know...with a poodle under one arm. A poodle! (laugh laugh laugh). Isn't that funny???"        Wow...that was the epitome of "off on a tangent". You know, I think those are the only reasons that I'm not turning into a Goth. It's not many, but that's ok. The whole monotone bit made me feel better.

       Since I can't beat this part of myself, I'm going to accept it. In the past, feeling like this was always a great outlet for writing terribly meaningful poetry that came straight from my heart. But since I'm, to a certain extent, expecting this to be the time to write good stuff, I can't. That's ok. That's fine by me. I have a lot of other work to do. You say you need a revolution, John? I need one too. I'm ready. I ready for some self expression and a retreat to my roots. I'm not going to magically transform into the cookie-cutter person I've been counting on becoming. That's way is too much like right. I just want to be happy. If being happy means not being rich and not working towards the American Dream, that's fine. I'm down for anti-socialism. In a way that is healthy and friendly and comfortable for me. I want to not care what the guy next door has and what I don't. I want to have what I have and be content with that.    I will write more later. I'm tired. I need to go dream a little dream.

        I want to use a new and pretty color      Today is Friday and I'm oh so thrilled (sarcasm). I guess I am anyways. I feel kinda limited when it comes to jubilation.          So...Monday might be my last day at work for a while. However, instead of quitting all together I think I might take the HR woman up on the Leave of absence option.     That way I can take an indefinite amount of time off to ease my mind, relax, clean house, find another job...etc. And if I can't find another job and we start to become poverty stricken, I can come back with my pathetic little tail between my legs.          Wednesday, (Jeannie's last day) at work I started feeling like I was going bonkers or something. I wanted to quit so bad. Just run out of here screaming into the woods or something. Instead I called my doc to schedule an "asap" meeting.      I was told that I could be seen at 345. Perfect.     I left here (work...that's where I always am) at 1p and headed home.     It felt good at home, I felt normal and hopeful there.          David called around 3p. I picked him up and we headed to the doc. When I got there the nurse (I love this lady because she's a typical older, smoker, deep voice, Atlantic City, maybe Jewish type lady- I love her) Anyways, she weighs me (I gained 4 lbs, that's less than I thought) then she took my BP. It was like 185 over 100. Very high. She proceeds to ask me what the matter was. I proceed to breakdown.  A shaking, red faced, snot sniffing basketcase. But she's sweet about it. She calls me honey a lot.      The doc comes in and I open up the flood gates again. He gives me a tissue , I give him a piece of my mind about 'my mind' and he gives me 2 prescriptions.     That's about how streamlined it went. I was given something similar to Valium and something else similar to Prozac.      I'm a nut and the worst part is...being a nut won't assist in me quiting my job and getting unemployment. I have it firgured out and I don't want to talk about it. OR work or money or unemployment or LOA or crazy drugs or being poor or nothing!      I need a break.

      First Bike:&nbsp; I haven't the foggiest .   First Real Date:  With David. I&nbsp;probably had&nbsp;some sort of pseudo date with some nameless guy in the past, but I don't&nbsp;feel like it counts.

First Credit Card:  Not unless you count a debit card :( It's for my own good though.    First Love:  David John Burns    First Enemy:&nbsp; Some hugangus brute of a girl in middle school.

      My best work buddy Jeannie, one of&nbsp;the main reasons&nbsp;for &nbsp;keeping my sanity, is leaving. She got a job at this credit union that everyone seems to be getting hired on at. I'd be interested in a job there but they have a lot of tight stipulations that I'm not prepared to abide by. (ie. credit screening, drug screening, night shift, lengthy interview process, a very long commute). So, I will wait it out here until I have a substantial amount of money saved or I get fired and draw unemployment. Which ever comes first. It's somewhat freeing working somewhere and not giving a rat's ass about job security. It's fun to dream up creative news ways to be insubordinate.

      Today I checked my&nbsp;account balance...-278.00 (yes...minus)! Because the bank screwed up and ran a check that was already debited a week before. So, I call them and they acknowledged that they made a mistake. BUT...it will be 3-4 weeks before the balance will return to it's correct amount. WTF! The very moment I get that money back you better believe I'm changing banks. That's ridiculous. I can barely believe they're able to get away with that.  Moving on, work is a lot better. I have an interview in a different department tomorrow. I'm looking forward to that. I want to move on. I don't think I'll get paid anymore, but anything's better.  I'm talking to this little fella at work. He's a nice guy. He has a my similar sense of humor and talking to him makes the day go by a little faster.&nbsp; After being with David (my David) for nearly four years I don't know what it means when I take a liking to someone. I know for a fact that I would never, ever cheat on him....but still it's weird. I feel guilty for some reason. Like I sat near him today, we email each other ALL DAY long, we take the same breaks. I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm sure it looks like I have a crush on him. I know it does, but I don't. I would never act on anything, EVER. I'm just used to having male friends and he's the type of male friend I would have. Also, he's engaged too, so it's not&nbsp;even a remote possibility.&nbsp; Maybe I'm having a mid-relationship crisis. I can't really explain the logic behind wanting to talk to him so much. Maybe it's because I want attention from a guy. I want to feel like someone's attracted to me. What I'm about to say is such a "guy" thing to say....but I just want to see if I still got it.  Ok, that's enough talk about this. I feel weird as hell about the whole thing. Today is almost over and I'm glad. I'm exhausted. I need to&nbsp; write something great tonight. I will hopefully come up with something soon. I have alot of indescribable emotions whirling around, it might help to convert them into poetic reasoning. I will make a sincere effort and post it here. I'm excited to go home and try later this evening.

      Sunday night.....getting my ass kicked at Canasta, bored, tired, frusterated.....  I've been horrible this week and all weekend. I've literally felt 10 pounds heavier. I know it's from eating way unfealthy food (lots of it) and sitting on my ass constantly. Tomorrow's Take Two. I'm determined. Also, I watched this movie the other day where this heavy set woman was at the alter being married and she let out a breath and her wedding dress split up the back and her ass cheeks popped out. That scene seriously made me&nbsp;start to hyper-ventilate. I just know that's what's going to happen. That's a very scary thought. Ok, enough of that. I don't want to be in an even more shitty mood tonight. Actually, I'm not shitty....just tired.  I think I'm finally seeing past some very trying financial issues we've been having lately. I suck with money. I, not too long ago, came into about 2 grand out of the clear blue and squandered it all. I'm just that way. I buy and buy buy and then I get buyer's remorse and then I buy more crap I don't need. It's fun...I have alot of things, but then I'm always broke again. Ok, this is another thing I don't want to get into. More talk that will just incinuate bad feelings.  I'm tired of real life....money, corporate america, boredom, politics, laziness, grocery shopping, mechanics, waiting for payday, writing checks, doing dishes, cleaning my tiolet, cleaning out the litter box, taking the trash out, doing laundry, wanting to lose weight and losing my determination instead, arguing, being flaky.  I want to live an abstract life for a while. I know it's virtually impossible. But I miss being young. I want to write poetry, go to coffee shops, meet new people, express myself through music, the clothes I wear and the things I choose to say. I feel old. I don't like that feeling. I want to rewind to 3 years back and enjoy life the right way.  I really want to travel too. I want to see places like India, all over Europe, Australia, South America. I want to see exotic places and meet people that are different from the people I see day in and day out. I want to learn new things. I crave those experiences and I'm scared that I'll never be able to get there. That's my life's mission. I want to experience all that I possibly can.  I really need to write more. I want to write as much as I used to and try to get some of it published. I know I can...I really like my stuff....at the risk of sounding conceited. But if I like it, that must say something. You're your own worst critic, right?? I'm not just going to belly ache about it, I am going to come up with new ideas...as they come to me of course. Anything forced is just&nbsp;obviously scripted and absolute trash.  I will post some of my work here soon. I have to in order to be satisfyed.  Ok, I need to go to sleep.

      Since last Friday until now I've been absolutley terrible. I've eaten and drank what ever in the world I've wanted and I haven't exercised at all. I need to get back in the saddle. I think the problem was that I rationalized my Birthday weekend as a total "Get out of jail free card". I guess I assumed I could just resume my good habits when Monday rolled on around. Not so.  The reason I haven't written in a while is because I'm bummed about the whole thing. Not like it's ruling my universe, but that's a little annoyance eating away at am. I think instead of beating myself up about it, I'm going to consider it a long weekend and forget about it.  On to other, more trying situations.  My job and how I absolutley despise it.  That's the title to my resignation. I wish it was. I really don't even know where to start with this subject.  I've worked at this Travel Fullfilment firm for about a year and a half now. I started enrty level and tried clawing my way to the top. I regularly spoke with upper management about being given more responsibilty. One supervisor mistook my dedication and energy for insubordinace and said that I was "over zealous". (But I always thought being zealous about something, especially your career, was a good thing ??) So, I blew this guys comment off because he was pretty much an ignorant, uneducated laughing stock that 'ass-kissed' his way to the top.  That's not really a great starting point, working anywhere. But I blew it off and still gave it my all. I volunteered for everything, sometimes before I even knew what I was volunteering for. I didn't care. I wanted to do and know everything I could about the corporation I was employed with.  From the day I started I was interested in being a trainer. Because those were my roots. It's what I know. So, one day I noticed they posted a training position in my location. I applied, presented a very impressive portfolio and interviewed like a champ. In the end they black-balled me because a former employee came back...with half the expertise I incompassed, and they handed that person the spot because they were related to one of the "higher-ups". I was and still am livid. That ridiculous. I'm sick of the office politics and am very ready to move on.  I also have a degree in cosmetology and I'm pushing to rent a spot in a local spa. That would be so much better for my nerves. I need creative freedom and I need to get away from this petty line of work. Don't get my wrong...the job itself is great. I'm a&nbsp;corporate travel&nbsp;agent (among&nbsp;other things)&nbsp;for some&nbsp;suits on the east coast and I love that aspect of the job....but the enviroment here is laughable. So, in closing....I'm about to be out. I'm just waiting for my cosmetoloist's liscense to be renewed..then I'm out. I can't wait until that day. I think it will change so many aspects of my life. I'm ready.  Coicidently, I'm writing all this from work. LOL. I'd better get back to it.

        I just watched THE most terrible movie in the entire history of the cinematic art form. Now, I'm usually one for indie flicks, because you never know, they might be real and interesting but THIS one was laughable. I watched 'Elephant', directed by Gus Van Sandt. The premise was 'a day in the life of' about 10 high school kids, two of which were distraught and planned to shoot up the place, a la Columbine. The film was riddled with five minute back shots of kids walking through the halls doing and saying nothing and when they did speak they used this obviously strained nonchalant 'acting' dialect. There were long shots of the sky and more of kids doing and saying nothing. One topic of conversation for these three girls was dividing time between her crush and her friends and the age old balance between the two. Soooo dramatic. Then they proceeded to eat salads and talk about how fat saturated salad dressing was and go to the school bathroom in stalls next to one another and throw up. I could go on for days. It was poorly casted, directed and executed. The camera angles were annoying and the dialogue was even more annoying. I DO NOT recommend it. I made it through the end, only because the same urge as craning your neck to check out a car accident motivated me. I kept hoping it would get better and it never did. Good thing it was free. Yuck. Man, that was a disappointment. Ok, I'm done bashing. David and I have been arguing the last few days and it sucks as well (but not as bad as the movie). I think I'm going to start comparing the level of something being bad to that movie. Like, liver and onions suck but not as bad as 'Elephant'. Maybe not. But anyways, David has been acting really weird. We've been arguing about nothing. I think those are the worst arguments and they get the most heated. Because it's frustrating. You can't really relay what you're thinking or feeling because the basis of the fight is intangible. I think those kinds of disagreements are the worst. He's gone right now and it doesn't feel good. I think he had to get out though, or else we'd just keep fighting about nothing. I hope he's okay. He hasn't called at all since he left. I cannot stand worrying. That's the most frustrating emotion I think. I feel really weird right now. I'm not going to make an issue of it though. I'll just watch the other movie I rented then probably go to bed. Who knows.

        Today I got a call from my cousin around 4p to tell me to pick the dogs up from their house because my aunt's water broke and they were on their way to the hospital. I talked to my aunt for a little while and she seemed calm enough. I was the one who was being spazzy. I think it was from all the coffee I drank earlier.  So I called my mom, grandparents, uncle and David to let them know that she was in labor. I wanted to go up there as soon as I heard but David took the car to work and I was without a ride. My mom said she was also going up to the hospital and she would give me lift. On the way there we passed David....so we turned around, picked him up and all drove together. David was out of sorts today. I don't know why. Not talkative, looking annoyed, bored, etc. I think he was just tired though. But when he's feeling bad or annoyed I can't help but be affected. It's the E.T. and Elliot syndrome.  My aunt went into the O.R. around 10p and they wheeled out little Mya Shea Ehlers at apporx. 11:20 pm on Friday the 13th of August 2004. She weighed 7 lb.s and 3 ounces and was 21 1/1 inches long. She had a perfect rosey complexion and a thick head of dark hair. She was absolutely stunning. Us Taylor's make gorgeous babies. I haven't made one yet...but I will one day.  Ray, Paula's hubby was very excited. He's a first time daddy. He was beaming. After we looked at Mya through the infant viewing window we could go into recovery two at a time to see Paula. She was a trooper. Her epideral was wearing off and she was starting to shake from the pain but she made the whole thing look effortless. Ray said when she was in there for her cesarean she was making jokes. Saying things to the doctor like "While you're poking around in there why don't you do a tummy tuck" and "I can flip over too and you can suck some fat out of my ass too". She's a nut.  So that's that. There's a new addition to the fam and she's beautiful. It's after 2 am and I'm drained. Time to sleep.

        People on the Gulf Coast are so desensitized to hurricanes and tropical storms. It's probably becuase there hasn't been one that's caused any major damage in about 5 years. I like hurricanes. As long as no one is hurt or the power isn't out for more than 1 day.           So, I've been helping my mother decorate some rooms in her house the last few days. We finished her bedroom today. It looks really nice. We painted the walls a butterscotch color and accented using some gold and red items. It looks really classy. It's about time she gets something to make her happy. She's had it really rough the last few years raising a toddler and trying to run a horse boarding business. I think she's out of the 'horse game' with the exception of her 3 horses. I'm glad. It's a lot of high maintance, stressful work.          Tomorow we're going to get started on my little brother's room. I want to do like a nautical Finding Nemo theme. I want to paint the walls blue like water and paint Nemo characters all over. I think in the corner I'm going to hang a fish net with a bunch of shells and starfish and stuff. I also want to paint a portion of one of his walls with chalkboard paint. He seems to have an affinity with painting, drawing, and scribbling on the walls over there. I think my mom's going to make curtains and pillows to keep with the same nautical theme. This is going to be a fun project tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I have alot of ideas.          I still need to write my thoughts on starting the salon on Monday. I think I'm trying to put it off mentally even though I'm really excited. I hope it works out. I already have an appointment for my first client! It's Jeannie, god love her! I'm going to give her the bomb manicure and pedicure. I can't want to get the ball rolling over there.     I need to go to Sally's this weekend and pick up some shit. I love shopping for salon supplies. It's fun to me for some reason.          In the last post I seemed hellbent to talk about Cheesa and who exactly she is. It's not neccessary. She is a freind from high school. I don't think we would mesh together very well at this point in our lives. We just have really different things going on. She has 2 kids and another on the way, married, a mini van..the whole  nine and she's younger than me. Seeing her and her position makes me really want to take it slow. She can't even take a crap without someone wanting to know what color it was. Yuck....not as funny as I thought. But I'm keeping it anyways...I'm too lazy to backspace.          On that note, I'm hitting the hay...I have lots to do tomorrow.          More another day.

       To Whom It May Concern: Please consider this document my resignation. I will be unable to fulfill my two weeks notice due to medical limitations. I feel as if I have been an exemplary employee with TRX since I started in February 2003. Since that time I have willfully taken on many additional tasks that were not in my job description. I've only gotten one raise of .26 in the year and a half that I've been with TRX even considering the additional repsonsiblities I've both volunteered for and accepted after being asked. Such as Clear Travel, being crossed trained on the Expedia account, schedule changes, exchanges, other queues, Help Desk, walking Help Desk, at times covering for TLs when attending meetings, etc. I also received another increase of .50, but only after being selected for the Schedule Change Agent position, which is not a raise, only a change of departments. I did tell my immediate supervisor of my medical concerns prior to taking medical leave. So, I feel that I went through the proper channels prior to my decision. Even after voicing my concerns, I was asked to not only maintain my then current position as the sole Schedule Change agent, which normally is covered by three agents at any given time, but also being the only designated Clear Travel agent. I did relay to Team Leaders as well as Christine that these two tasks were very difficult to maintain concurrently. During the two week period of handling both tasks I was under a great deal of stress. I also had 2 doctor's appointments within this same two week time span and learned that my blood pressure was dangerously high. Since my highly stressful predicament at work, I've been prescribed medication for panic attacks, high blood pressure, and depression. My doctor has recommended that I find an alternate place of employment considering the high level of stress caused by my most recent position at TRX. However, he will not or cannot get involved in the Medical Leave proceedings for over one pre-approved week due to his firm uninvolvement in this type of situation. Thus, leaving me no other alternative than to execute my decision to part with TRX. My poor physical standing obviously concerns me a great deal and I think it best for both parties.

        Today I met with the owner of the biggest and most reputable salon in this town, Extensions Day Spa. We talked for a while, I gave her my credentials, she gave me a tour, and she offered me a job! And or course I accepted. I start Monday. Since it's a salon and I keep and maintain my own clientele, I can pretty much make my own hours. So that's comforting. I get free tanning, facials, cut/color/style for hair, etc. I'm very excited.      So much in fact that I don't want to sit here and type about it....I want to go call people.          In my next entry I want to write more about that salon, what has yet to come with TRX, mom's business ideas, who exactly Cheesa is, promoting myself...etc. A lot.          More to come!

           Friday was my doctor's appointment. The deciding factor for whether or not I'll be able to stay out of work based on doctor's recommendations. My blood pressure was way up so he gave me blood pressure medicine BUT said I have to go back to work on Monday. He said he didn't get involved in medical leave issues with employers. He said practices have gone under getting involved in situations like that. I say he's a pussy.  So, I'm quitting TRX indefinitely. David told me he forbids me to go back because he hasn't seen me this happy being away from there since before I worked there. He assured me that we will make it financially and that he'd hustle and work his ass of just so I don't have to go back. I thank him dearly for having that sentiment.  I have other prospects lined up. For one, I have an interview at a the day spa Extensions on Monday. Also, my mom wants me to help her with some interior decorating out at her place....painting, wallpaper, etc. She said she would pay me 10.00 an hour. I at first refused because I don't want to take money from my mom, but she won't take no for and answer.  Also, she wants to lease this business space out by her house for a salon/boutique. She's already talked to the realtor about it. She wants to go down to the courthouse with me sometime this week to get my business license.  I find this opportunity very fascinating. I already have ideas for the layout of the place. Tile floors,bright colors, lots of plants, Indian decor, the boutique area will have local made ware (jewelry, art, gifts, lotions, cosmetics, frangrances, etc.), I can rent areas for other stylists. Her idea just has a lot of potential. It will also take a lot of work, but I think I'd be up for it. I like the idea of hustling for something if it was mine. I don't want to get too excited though, it's not even reached the runway yet.  On Saturday we went to Chan's for drinks. It was pretty laid back and I was feeling damn good. I got a shot of Southern Comfort and 2 whiskey sours. Yum! David got some other drinks as well and since his brother, Nathan, is the bartender there everything was free. What was fucked up was that we (well I, because I was drunk and had false sincerity) invited Nathan back to our house because he lives alone and his roommate just took his TV when she left. I felt bad for him.  So, we told Nathan we were going to get something to eat and then go to their father's house and come back to get him around 3a. What the hell was I thinking I didn't want to be out until 3! So what ACTUALLY ended up taking place was that I fell asleep on the in-laws couch and was out like a light. David shortly followed...and Nathan, well Nathan was unheard of until we called him the next day at 1pm. I did feel bad, but everybody's over it.  I have a baby shower to attend for a blast from the past, Cheesa, today at 4:00. I haven't talked to her in ages. Primarily because I didn't want to. It was intentional. But my mom gave her my number. So, now I feel obligated. I'm sure it won't be that bad. I'll write about it when I get back.  Jeannie, if you read this....I will call you soon. I've been caught up and swept away lately....But I will call. I hope you're doing ok.  Also, I wrote an awesome, intelligent, funny, LONG ass entry like on Thursday night about a lot of different things and the shit timed out on me and was deleted. I don't think I had ever been so frustrated in my life and because I was so irate, I haven't written until now. That explains the short hiatus. Now, what I do is write it all in Word, save it and copy it in my blog. That's the only way to go. I don't want to be that pissed again.

        Today is my first day home on LOA. It's pretty nice. I woke up at 10a, straightened up the house, folded clothes, watched some TV, went grocery shopping, paid the rent, etc. It's nice being laid back. I didn't do too much because I figured it's the first day and I'll do more and more as the boredom kicks in.  I watched the View today. My first mistake. The bitches on that show are ridiculous. I don't know how that show has been on for as long as it has. They had an actor on today and when he came out the young, stupid blond asks him "How is it working with the big guys like Nick Cage and John Travolta?". He answers and before he's really even done with his sentence she asks; "So, I hear you used to be homeless. How was that?" What? Come again. How the hell do you think it was dumb ass? The actor kinda looked out into the audience (most likely to his manager or agent, Like where the fuck am I?) The the other ladies proceed to chime in with questions like, "Did you eat out of the garbage and dumpsters. If so, did you ever find good food?", "Did you shower?", "Did you stink?", "Did you sleep on park benches?" All of the expected, typical questions one would ask for their own amusement. The guy was a champ though, he answered all of their ignorant questions. Although, he was visibly annoyed. It was one of those awkward TV moments, where you're just like, What the hell is going on? Also, I'm pretty sure this guy was on to promote some movie, not to be spokesperson for homeless America, but they didn't even get to it. What a bum wrap!  Two other comments about the View.....First, Meredith Vierra. She is an obviously horny broad. Bi-sexual too. Whether it's a man or a woman. Whether she's on the View, Millionaire or her new Advil commercial. She's always acting horny or talking about sex. She's got those "I want to fuck right now before I explode" eyes. You can just tell. I mean, I guess. That's the way I see it anyways. Second, Star Jones. What's her secret? She's lost a lot of weight lately. She's either gotten the gastric by-pass surgery or she has one hell of a giant tape worm going on. I think it's the latter of the two. Because on the show today they had a chef preparing some crap...you know how they have those gimmicky cooking segments about whatever. Anyways....she was eating all the shit he had displayed and if I'm not mistaken, you can't eat like that after the gastric surgery. Your innards will explode. So, that would explain the tapeworm theory. Those crazy Hollywood diets.  I really need to get a hobby if I'm going to be at home all day.  Oh shit....I was just thinking. What about the male version of the View, The Other Half. With Danny Boniduchi, Dick Clark, Mario Lopez (a hopeless flamer, by the way, who still tries to hide it) and some other guy. I wonder what ever happened to that show. I miss Danny always talking about rehab and 12 step programs. That show was pretty amusing.

       I'm at work again.      Latest news: I gave Kevin a quarter and a link to this here blog.       It makes me kind of weary giving my blog address to a lot of people. But, like Kevin said....what's the point of writing in it then. It's a good way to catch up on friends without seeing or talking to them in a while. A sneaky way of looking in and knowing how they are.      Goddamnit! Someone just said something about it being a Monday again. That just peeves me lately. The whole office environment in general peeves me.      On my way to the Fine Things place my car starting 'ticking' (it has an oil leak and when it's low...it ticks) and I forgot both my visa and check book at home. So I stopped by my grandparents to see if they had an extra quart of oil or a five spot.   Luck has it, my Gram was late giving me my B-day card and it contained twenty dollars. That worked out nicely.      After going to the store and putting a couple quarts of oil in the car, I made my way to that shop I've been talking about all morning. The place is really nice. But the owner appears to be one of those Southern, well-to-do ladies. She seemed nice enough though. I can't be too judgmental. I'm only being that way because I assume she's being judgmental towards me. Issues?? Yes, many.   I had the option of giving her my resume or filling out an application. Resume of course. I'm lazy.      Here I am now. At work. No new prospects of finding a different job. I have, however, been talking with the HR woman about LOA. I can take it now....this moment. I can't walk out of here and start my vacation. This very moment. But I can't for some reason. I'm hanging on as long as possible. It's for the money of course. I'm tempted to stay here for another pay day. I just don't want to be crying wolf. I guess I'll just wait for a breaking point. Something very telling. That screams ....      "NOW IS THE TIME. LEAVE!"

        This morning I'm going into work about an hour an a half late. I saw this hiring sign outside this upscale gift/decor shop called Fine Things. They open at 10a and I'm going to be there bright eyed and busy-tailed to see about getting a job. It's been a long time since I've been job hunting. I've never had any problems in the past, but you never know.      When I called into TRX this morning to let them know I was coming in late, I talked to one of my more favorite Team Leaders, Carl. He asked if I was okay. I said yeah and he commented that he knew of my situation. I guess they had a little pow-wow about me. I wonder what was said. I wonder if they think I'm going to come in there all disgruntled one day with a duffel bag. (Fuzzy thoughts) I'm not frustrated in a way like that though. Just over worked and under paid. In need of a break.      David is extra supportive. I'm so appreciate of him. In a way I don't think he knows. Probably because I'm having a hard time showing it because of my gloomy mood. I've decided not to take the crazy medicine the doc prescribed for me. I know I don't have a chemical imbalance or anything. Although, it's easier to think I do because it's, in a way, an explanation for feeling the way I do. Even still, I'm not taking it. I know I can feel worse and when or if I do...I'll really need something then.      Today is Jeannie's first day of work at the all holy Navy Federal that everybody got hired on at. I'm so curious to hear how that went. I'm excited for her. It sounds like it'll be great. I hope it doesn't have 'a catch', as Gwen put it. It does, kind of, sound too good to be true. Like TRX. I loved TRX at first. I told myself, "This is it, I can really get comfy here. I'll be here a while". HA!!      Ok, I'm going to get ready to drive up to the Fine Things place. Wonder what'll happen. Probably not too much. That is, even if they still have an opening. We shall see. I feel sick and nervous.
