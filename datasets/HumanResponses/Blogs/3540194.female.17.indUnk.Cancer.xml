       ~ Hi Erica.  Please remove your birthdate from your profile. You should not put that kind of info online. I don't care what everyone else is doing. It's a recipe for identity theft.&nbsp; Also, it's fine to have that group picture, but do not put a photograph of yourself online.  Erica, we give you alot of latitude w/ this stuff, but I will only continue to do so if you keep your identity safe.&nbsp; I don't have to spell it out for you.  Do you&nbsp;understand why?  xoxo  Mom &amp; Dad   Truely Yours 89: because ur crazy??   ~no, because you are naive and guys are horney and creative and sly.So, please take your birthdate off and no pictures of you   Truely Yours 89: ewww daddy!!! i took off the birthdate dont worry but ur still crazy

      weed- a lot of shit has been going on and i have absolutely no control over it or what it is doing to me, i hvae learned to never trust another person as long as i live because this way no one will ever be able to hurt me; but you somehow fucking broke that goddamn barrier i have put up around myself and forced me to care for u and goddamn it i hate u for it. i hate the fact that your moms favorite and that i can do no right in their eyes. Forever i was the dumb jock who didnt need grades, just relied on athletics, and for awhile it worked...now i beat u and u have no idea how good that feels.Im better than u at something in life. Forever i was jealous of u for the friends you had and the people who liked u. Wow, definetly cannot post this but i need u 2 understand taht i love u and i hope we settled this stupid shit about friends because im sick of all the goddamn drama in my life. Im warning u now that i am fed up w/ the world and do not trust ne1 or nething right now and dont give a shit about nething that goes on around me because ive been hurt by a lot of people at once and am not ready to be close with ne1 or trust ne1. its safer this way. Just know that I love u and ill always love u no matter wat and no boy will ever mess that up for long ;). Dont sweat the small stuff and DONT EVER TAKE ANYTHING I SAY SERIOUS. i thought u knew me better than that. Keep up the good work my little whale and know im always here for u no matter wat.

      Rules for This Diet...the depression diet If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.  If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the calories in the candy bar are canceled out by the diet soda.  When you eat with someone else, calories don't count if you do not eat more than they do.  Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER count, such as hot chocolate, brandy, toast and Sara Lee Cheesecake.  If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.  Movie-related foods do not have additional calories because they are part of the entertainment package and not part of one's personal fuel. Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints, Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.  Cookie pieces contain no calories.  The process of breaking causes calorie leakage.  Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.  Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. Examples are: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.  Anything consumed while standing has no calories.  This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.  Anything consumed from someone else's plate has no calories since the calories rightfully belong to the other person and will cling to his/her plate.  (We ALL know how calories like to cling!)  REMEMBER: STRESSED SPELLED BACKWARDS IS DESSERTS

      Wtf? If someone tells someone else that they like them, even if its not true, ppl are gonna believe it. And if it isnt, the other person will figure it out eventually. No one is that stupid. I am underestimated, hurt, and feeling very stupid right now.  To the girl, i dont care if you do anything, im not stupid and its not my place at all. I know that he lied and im ok with that. I feel soo stupid though.... To the boy, i hope ur happy because now that i am no longer in complete denial i realize we arent friends, i cant trust u, and i dont know wat i saw in you.  bye

      An 83-year old woman decided that she'd seen and done everything, and the time had come to depart from this world.  After considering various methods of doing away with herself, she came to the conclusion that the quickest and surest method would be to shoot herself through the heart. The trouble was, she wasn't certain about exactly where her heart was, so she phoned her doctor and asked him. He told her that her heart was located two inches below her left nipple.   So she shot herself in the left kneecap.

       A man was chosen for jury duty who very much    wanted to be dismissed from serving.He tried every    excuse he could think of but none of them worked.    On the day of the trial he decided to give it one more shot.    As the trial was about to begin he asked if he could    approach the bench."Your Honor," he said, " I must be    excused from this trial because I am prejudiced against    the defendant.I took one look at the man in the blue suit    with those beady eyes and that dishonest face and I said&nbsp;    'He's a crook!&nbsp; He's guilty, guilty, guilty'.&nbsp; So your Honor,    I could not possibly stay on this jury!"The judge replied,    "Get back in the jury box. You are just the kind of juror we    are looking for&nbsp;-- a good judge of character. That man is his  lawyer .":-[

       PAT BUCHANAN:  To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.   DR. SEUSS:  Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The chicken crossed the road,  But why it crossed,  I've not been told!   ERNEST HEMINGWAY:  To die. In the rain.   MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.   GRANDPA:  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.   ARISTOTLE:  It is in the nature of chickens to cross the road.   KARL MARX:  It was a historical inevitability.   SADDAM HUSSEIN:  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.   RONALD REAGAN:  What chicken?   CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK:  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.   FOX MULDER:  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?   FREUD:  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.   BILL GATES:  I have just released eChicken 98, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.   EINSTEIN:  Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?   BILL CLINTON:  I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? Could you define chicken please?   LOUIS FARRAKHAN:  The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.   THE BIBLE:  And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.   COLONEL SANDERS:  I missed one?

       Any similarity between you and a human is purely coincidental!   Anyone who told you to be yourself couldn't have given you worse advice.   Are your parents siblings?   As an outsider, what do you think of the human race?   Better at sex than anyone; now all he needs is a partner.   Calling you stupid would be an insult to stupid people.   Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home?   Do you ever wonder what life would be like if you'd had enough oxygen at birth?   Do you want people to accept you as you are or do you want them to like you?   Don't you have a terribly empty feeling - in your skull?   Do you still love nature, despite what it did to you?   Don't you need a license to be that ugly?   Every girl has the right to be ugly, but you abused the privilege!   Go ahead, tell them everything you know. It'll only take 10 seconds.   Have you considered suing your brains for non-support?   He has a mind like a steel trap - always closed!   He is living proof that man can live without a brain!   He is the kind of a man that you would use as a blueprint to build an idiot.   He's not stupid; he's possessed by a retarded ghost.   Here's 20 cents. Call all your friends and bring back some change!   Hi! I'm a human being! What are you?   How did you get here? Did someone leave your cage open?   I'd like to see things from your point of view but I can't seem to get my head that far up my ass.   I bet your brain feels as good as new, seeing that you've never used it.   I bet your mother has a loud bark!   I could make a monkey out of you, but why should I take all the credit?   I don't consider you a vulture. I consider you something a vulture would eat.   I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works!   I don't think you are a fool. But then what's MY opinion against thousands of others?   I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside.   I hear you were born on a farm. Any more in the litter?   I heard you got a brain transplant and the brain rejected you!   I heard you went to have your head examined but the doctors found nothing there.   I know you are nobody's fool but maybe someone will adopt you.   I thought of you all day today. I was at the zoo.   I would ask you how old you are but I know you can't count that high.   I'd like to help you out. Which way did you come in?   I'd like to leave you with one thought...but I'm not sure you have anywhere to put it!   I'd love to go out with you, but my favorite commercial is on TV.   I'll never forget the first time we met - although I'll keep trying.   I'm busy now. Can I ignore you some other time?   I've seen people like you before, but I had to pay admission!   If I ever need a brain transplant, I'd choose yours because I'd want a brain that had never been used.   If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person alive.   If we were to kill everybody who hates you, it wouldn't be murder; it would be genocide!   If what you don't know can't hurt you, she's invulnerable.   If you stand close enough to him, you can hear the ocean.   If your brain was chocolate it wouldn't fill an M&amp;M.   Keep talking, someday you'll say something intelligent.   Learn from your parents' mistakes - use birth control!   Pardon me, but you've obviously mistaken me for someone who gives a damn.   So, a thought crossed your mind? Must have been a long and lonely journey.   Some day you will find yourself - and wish you hadn't.   There is no vaccine against stupidity.

       At the Russian War College, a general is a guest lecturer and tells the class of officers that the session will focus on potential problems and the resulting strategies.   One of the officers in the class begins by asking the first question,   "Will we have to fight in a World War Three?"   "Yes, comrades, it looks like you will," answers the general.   "And who will be our enemy, Comrade General?" another  officer asks.   "The likelihood is that it will be China."   The class is surprised, and finally one officer asks,  "But Comrade General,we are 150 million people and  they are about 1.5 billion. How can we possibly win?"   "Well," replies the general, "Think about it. In  modern war, it is not the quantity, but the quality  that is the key.   For example, in the Middle East, 5 million Jews have been fighting against 50 million Arabs, and the Jews  have been the winners every time."   "But sir," asks the panicky officer, "Do we have enough Jews" ? ?

       A man is driving along a highway and sees  a rabbit jump out across the middle of the road.  He swerves to avoid hitting it, but unfortunately  the rabbit jumps rightin front of the car.  The driver, a sensitive man as well as an animal  lover, pulls over and gets out to see what has  become of the rabbit. Much to his dismay, the  rabbit is dead.The driver feels so awful that he  begins to cry.A beautiful blonde woman driving  down the highway sees a man crying on the side  of the road and pulls over. She steps out of  the car and asks the man what's wrong.  "I feel terrible," he explains, "I  accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it."  The blonde says, "Don't worry." She runs to  her car and pulls out a spray can.  She walks over to the limp, dead rabbit,  bends down, and sprays the contents onto  the rabbit.The rabbit jumps up, waves its  paw at the two of them and hops off down the  road.Ten feet away the rabbit stops, turns  around and waves again, he hops down the  road another 10 feet, turns and waves,  hops another ten feet, turns and waves,  and repeats this again and again and again,  until he hops out of sight.The man is  astonished. He runs over to the woman  and demands, "What is in that can?  What did you spray on that rabbit?"  The woman turns the can around so that the  man can read the label. It says,  "Hair Spray - Restores life to dead hair,adds permanent wave."
