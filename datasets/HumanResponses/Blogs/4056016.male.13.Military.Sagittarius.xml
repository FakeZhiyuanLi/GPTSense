       hey ya'll these are my classic poems that were in my buddyprofile before:     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Think of how much better life would be...  By Jesse Wellens   Think of how much better life would be  If the knights of the forest didnt say "Nee",  The world would rejoice in joyous mirth,  if someone would shoot ms. shoberg for all its worth,  and wouldnt it be better if cows didnt say moo,  and instead of milk, they gave mountain dew,  oh, i think homework should be no more,  just gimme some bombs, i'll settle the score,  oh think of how much better life would be,  if we all could just sit on our butts and watch TV.   &nbsp;  Mountain Dew  By Jesse Wellens   Oh i really love mountain dew,  its more fun to talk to than you,  mountain dew takes me higher,  so get me some freakin live wire,  i dont care what anyone thinks,  i am NOT ADDICTED! (boy, that stinks),  oh please dont deny it,  caffeine free sucks and so does diet,  oh, whats that you just said?  sorry i dont care, gimme some code red,  when drinking mountain dew, i feel so free,  oh, and u will NEVER have more than me!   &nbsp;  Friends  By Jesse Wellens   my friends all mean so much to me,  without them i would die,  i know they make me happy most times,  but sumtimes make me cry.   but they always cheer me up after that,  they never let me down,  they always make me feel better,  even for the smallest frown.   we all like to have shindigs,  we all like to hug each other,  once were done with one party,  we say, "hey, lets have another!"   i know sumtimes we fight,  and then we fight some more,  but cheering each other up afterwards,  thats what friends are for.   &nbsp;   ~Todays Random Fact About Me~   For all of you who dont know, my nickname is Izzy. Ya'll dont have to call me that or nething, but it makes me feel special to have 1! go me! neway, if u really want to call me that, thats ok too. Peace Out.   ~Izzy~
