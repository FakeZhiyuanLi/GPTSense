      hey im leaving in 1 hour :-(  im gonna miss this place seriously for me the best thing about LA is family that's what i'm always looking forward to the most when i come because my family is so important to me and i love them more than the weather or the malls or the beach or anything else. hope i get to come back next summer lol im thinking about that already this morning i went to coffee bean and i decided to try hot vanilla it was gross i really likes the pure white chocolate and malibu dream is ok but it gets me nauseous b/c some of those stuff is too rich. god i'm so tired i wasnt even up that late so i dont know y im so tired wtvr i have to go now i can't IM and write blogs simultaneously have a great day keep in touch LA people
