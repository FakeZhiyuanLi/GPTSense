      Yesterday I took major advantage of the sale at Hot Topic. $10 off all bottoms and an additional 50% off all clearance items. I had my eye on a particular pair of pants that had been on the clearance rack for about four months. They were $10! My friend bought them for me (I am paying her back :)) And I had $6 in change with me and I bought a black tank top with a red dragon printed on it. My other friend had that shirt too, hope I didn't offend her with buying a same one, but I had my eye on that shirt too, lol. So I finally get to dress in a way to express myself. I have a friend who has an incredible itch to "dress gothic". When I think about this, I realize that I've been Goth (not to be confused with 'Gothic' which is a style of architecture or a group of ancient people from ancient Germany and France, little histroical tidbit for you :)) but now I can dress like it. In my opinion Goth isn't a way you dress, it's a way you are. Just like being a Witch doesn't mean wearing a pentacle and doing a few spells. It's how you live and how you think that makes you a Witch or Goth (or a Goth Witch, :)) My friend (the one who bought my pants, THANK YOU!) began being Goth a year ago (maybe a little more) and I began to share her same ideas and tastes in music (LINKIN PARK!) and a couple weeks ago she told on on the phone, "Well, I consider you Goth. You just dress different cause you're a different kind of Goth." While I think the spikes and corsets are cool, I wouldn't wear them. The pants I got were like regular jeans but they have a REALLY dark green camo pattern. I like wearing black, but not all the time, especially in the summer, lol. I think this friend of ours is just trying to be like us. She has bought several things that we buy, usually a week after we show them to her, if not sooner. It's gotten to the point where I feel I can't tell her anything about myself because I think she'll begin to copy me. I really need ot talk to her. I had all these feelings about this way of being (Goth), and not dressing and had to type them out. Anyway, she came to school wearing the darkest clothes her father would let her and purple lipstick and announced to us, "I felt like dressing Gothic today!" This makes me cringe. You don't wake up and decide to dress Goth. You always are, in fact, you are or you're not. There's no semi-Goth. And the number one thing........BEING GOTH DOESN'T MEAN YOU ACT DEPRESSED ALL THE TIME!! Anyway, these are my feelings on this subject and I hope this has been enlightening or something of that nature. Anyway, another entry soon. Have a great day everyone! Blessed be!
