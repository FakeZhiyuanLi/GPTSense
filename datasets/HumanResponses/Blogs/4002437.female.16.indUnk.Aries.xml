                 Tone : Terribly Pissed  I Swear,this blog stuff can't be as easy as it seems to be.i mean all these "quick and easy" rubbish they always say is a bunch of lies.Its around 11.09pm at night and i'm about to tear the last strand of hair still stuck to my head cos i don't know how to insert the links into the page,do a proper questionarie,this is why i miss frontpage like hell.Man,websites are.....shitz.haha.  Oh Well...  Tone: Lighter now.  Hm,let me tell you about my day.It Started off alright,i mean i didn't wake up late,so i got to sam's house just on time for her dog to bark at me twice,run away and come back to sniff my leg(darn ticklish shit) and allow me to pet her.Then it was back with my shoes on and heading for the car.  Once at school,we rushed(So kiasu right *rolls eyes,TELL ME ABOUT IT!) to put our bags upstairs cos sam has just this impression that there was gonna be a sptchk for her class.True enuff,she was right!Boy,if i didn't know her,i would have thought she was psychic and has espn in her head(mean girls)..haha.  Other than that,alil' unfriendly comments from teachers here and there,nothing much to notice though,its flying in one ear and out thru the other,just like wind.or is it?ha.  And well,sorry,i HAVE TO SAY that social studies was horrendous,boring than hell.i would rather submit to 3 hours of torture of accompanying my dad watch golf than to go thru an 1hr of that nasty social studies lesson.Anyway,i did the most sinful thing a nerd could do...yes,sleep in class.that's right.And in a very uncomfortable position.  It was then i invented a sleeping position which made you look like you were writting althou you're likehalf dead and unconcious.haha,ange was laughing like hell!  Maths test?Do Not Talk About It.The Bloody first question was a brain cracker for me,for those who say it was easy,I AM OFFENDED.well,then i sorta did my graph wrong and had yan ling pointing that out to me.  After that,i met sam and steph over at novena for some chicken rice which was not flavourable enough,i feel.haha.what relevance is that right?what the hell.  Anyways,its getting late now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing off&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim.&nbsp; :P

                    Heh!Its smile week!  So smile!Be happy!      Today seems to drain all the energy out of me,whether its the food i've been consuming or either the thought of doing some studying,i have no idea.Maybe it was tennis yesterday?or the sun which shone on ubi and me during chinese period while we sat at the "shed" and did our chemistry and english homework?i heard that suntanning causes you to be really really tired.       I was so drowsy i wrote my maths sums weird.as in,my handwritting was tiny and thin,not like the usual board,fat long words i always write,angie would know what i mean!haha.so~ kim,that's what she said during social studies presentation which kinda went all wrong!oh heck!haha.         So i decided to play some music so that i could wake myself  up,fortunatly,it work!so i'm sorta up now.     Officially 26 days from our prelims now,its scaring the crap outta me...english and geog would be the 2 papers we will be starting with and straight after that would be social studies,so work work work people!We've got some classes to beat!haha,show them that we are truly 4/6 and better material than they underestimated!haha.     Have faith,take pride,and never give up.                                                                                    Kimberly.

                 Greetings again!   Haha,have to end this short today cos i have gotta be rushing off for dinner at parkway..ahha   Ok,the whole day was real fun cos we didn't have much lessons only till mrs tan came and everyone literally sighed so bloody loud.i feel ya all!haha.Loads of homework thou,2 sbq,god!now,they seriously are pushing us..haha    &nbsp;  Then there was tennis,which was real fun,cos for the first 30mins,we got to play by ourselves in one court,then we were called to join this coach,he was new,sorta,not chinese,alil' eurasian,very nice actually cos he was giving tips to dong,gerry and me,but thru the whole time we were laughing,i feel bad,but yeah.    &nbsp;  I had to partner him during the 5 4 3 2 1,and well,my shots were real bad,when was it ever good?haha.yep,so he did most of the shots.unfortunatly,i stupidly stood infront of this girl who was hitting and the tennis ball just hit straight at my chest,as in direct impact,she wasn't even 1 metre away,so as usual,my chest felt alil' numb n then due to friction and impact,it started to feel like it was on fire,after 15mins,it was alright again.i didn't really see her cos i was walking sideline of the court and was pickin up a ball,then,next thing you know,boom whack,and i was grabbing at my chest.haha.   So that hurt like hell....    &nbsp;  Other than that,the day was fine.except that angie ho said my history essay was sorta out of point and didn't really get it.gotta ask you again angie!sorry!    &nbsp;  Alrighty then,gotta rush off b4 i get bashed up!haha    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kimmified.Feel the -fied.          urlLink  &nbsp;

                 I can't even begin to explain why it was  sway ..but i shall try my best.     &nbsp;   Firstly,in the morning i had  spotchecks ,wasn't the first thou,thank and praise god.haha.so had preparation time.    Mag low,hm,how shall i begin?She,wearing her...well,the ugliest crap i have ever seen in my entire life,man,like which era is she in?the cowboy?china's reforms?stone age?or adam and eve?surely not adam and eve,the thought makes me want to throw.haha.     &nbsp;   Backgrd knowledge,it is said by someone that she used to wear her uniform terribly neatly,like the folds will fall ust holding the uniform up,don't know if that's humanly possible with starching even!and that she was,as quoted, " too good to do anything bad ?".haha,which was really good,maybe that's the reason for such strictness in her spotchecks etc,just to make everyone look proper or well,all unbreathable.Still,no reason for her to tarnish the earth with her fashion disasters.     &nbsp;   All right,back to the topic,i was  booked for my belt ,hell,its been long since i've been booked,feels good,i'm one of those who loves to self-flagellate myself.haha,its really weird,but of course i'm not those crazy or what in my terms are..mentally ill who have to cut themselves with a pen knife and make my cuts go parallel to each other due to relieve relief,that's just gross,and over doing it.cos i swear,it makes me want to show them what  self-infliction  is,of course using their arms,i would slash it like mad,maybe draw myself with that penknife of theirs.really sick.     &nbsp;   Anyways!losing myslf!ok,i had to make my belt one centimetre shorter which was really no offence at all.so,yeah,been there,did that.next,i'm  looking like&nbsp;a bloody nerd  or well,the same still!whoooo,had to pull my pants so high i got a wedgie like immediately.so,one,i had to deal with a fashion disaster,two,had an immediate wedgie,was sorta scared cos mag low looked intimidating,but seriously,after interrogation by her,i tell you,she's  all talk but no bite .Everyone was having a terribly moody face but i don't see why at all,man,these crap of spotchecks are fun,makes life all the bit more interesting to live,every once in awhile.haha.I also was accuse of dyed hair,but ah,rubbish! brown hair is my real hair colour ,its bloody hell red that's not!why can't all my friends and teachers get it,at least say its red for godsake's i tried so hard!urgh!but anyway,i don't think my hair was dyed as accused today,cos i went to snip my ponytail off and most of the red dye,well,was on that!so,accused for natural coloured hair,how unoriginal is that!my sister also got that,but she really didn't dye.hm,maybe it  runs in the family .so,with that off,poor atalia though,she had to like have a face to face period with mag low cos she couldn't get her uniquely pierced area's earring off!god,i tried to help,but hell,even tweezers don't work!oh,and btw,never ask me to sew anything,cos i sew like s***.     &nbsp;   Next sway thing,i was talking to yanhan about a perfect square question and was  rolling my eyes  (in a teasing manner)cos i couldn't understand what she said,and then next thing i know,mr tan asked me what was tt about,maybe he thought i was talking bad about him....haha,but i wasn't.so,he asked me to explain the question.me not knowing the bloody thing had to wel,use my example of 36 being "PRIME FACTORIZED"...god, like who remembers the names for it ,as long as you can do it!but yeah.the reason why was that the prime number has to be even powered,when square rooted,it will return to its original single prime factor form,therefore,making it a  perfect square .however,important fact to note is that he was well,alil' happier today,which means he  wasn't as bad as i thought .     &nbsp;   The last sway thing was when i just had to  go to the toliet  during english lessons,i even waited till ms yip finish explaining her geography stuff before even asking..and i was just at the brim of bursting like a water bomb overfilled with water.unfortunatly,she just had to tell me no and ask why?me,being a dodo because i couldn't think abt anything besides going to the toliet,had no clue what she was asking for,so i said.."because.....i am urgent!",but she just stared at me like i was a real idiot(remember,i needed to pee real bad),so i decided to try again because i was getting really desperate,so i told her(she knew it was coming so started to put her hand up): "  my urine has to come out.." ..and well of course,everyone's response was to groan and say "gross!/disgusting!"..haha.i was desperate,so she corrected me by saying..."i urgently...."urging my to continue from thereon,then i said " i urgently need to use the toliet ",which was gramatically correct,finally!can't imagine i have to make a scene just to go to the toliet.*sighs.    When i came back from the toliet,she asked.."better?",i laughed loudly and told her .."very much." and she frowned,but nodded after i asked"its correct right?".     &nbsp;   Other than that,the day has been alright,just that i'm seriously hungry right now,and there ain't a scrap, feel like a scavanger .oh bloody!Alright,remember to do your history work and english work too...and chemistry and....yup.ha.    * flagellation   n : beating with a whip or strap or rope as a form of punishment   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Signing off now ,  Kim Jordan .

                  It Has To be the saddest thing for anyone to live a life denouncing others.Just terrible.Not only do they denounce one,they shunn them without reason and when help is needed,these sort of people will not even lift a finger to help you because they are....arragont as hell.they possibly don't care for others and only expect others to attend to their whims.Seeing this occuring in life makes me overly sick.I sure as hell wouldn't like to be on the end receiving the butts.         I have to take off my hat to you if you are able to actually swallow&nbsp;your pride and apologize.THAT,i would say takes alot of dignity and effort and courage to do it.for i,would not even spare a thought for it.         Switching topics,i would say the "talk" that ms yip gave us worked just abit and well,showed you that teachers don't really seem what they are,and that with failure comes success and she has justly proven so.so all you guys out there about to give up due to present condition and situation,don't.god gave us all a brain,we might be dumb at times but for sure,NOT ALL THE TIME..haha.         Jumping to another topic again...tomorrow is our physics        test which has been prosponed from time to time....are you sure its REALLY TOMORROW?well,as i said magnetism is included which is a terribly large topic with too much god forsaken theory to remember,i mean hell,would you be wasting your time next time trying to play with magnets?haha,but you guys better study and do your radioactivity worksheet and don't make mr chan angry cos he shouldn't deserve to feel it.YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.yes.that.excatly what you're thinking.         And complete your chemistry work!the test behind the textbook,its alot,but its also sort of studying at the same time when you do your work,that's what i realize,god!now i'm being dumb.Your history essay too,who cares if you don't know how to weigh!just attempt it,ms chow said you gt at least what?2 marks? for attempts?haha.         Remembr there's really little time to your prelim,around 30 days?well,sorta.so,buck up,pull those ankle socks real high to your thighs!haha.start with geo and ss,they are bloody heavy subjects and the first to go!i gotta get my fat lazy ass to study,my brains are like sleeping 24/7!urgh!someone!motivate me!!so far,i would have to thank yan han for motivating me by doing all her homework like 3 days before due and stressing me out and well....for her to be teling me that she has studied this that and that....haha,that really stresses me out.and i realize i don't work well with notes,i take too long,don't knw what kind of notes to make,so forget it,i'm doing it the textbook based way!good luck to me and good luck to you 4/6-ers out there.         Have faith in thy self!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humoring you always, Kim J.

Well,there's chemistry to do,don't knw how to do the poly god knows what man,and the essay question on russia,bolsheviks...darn them,why can't they live happy you know,just kill all of them.its much easier than the policies and stuff....bloody people.Then there's the english summary,which i have no idea on how to summarize.argh.life sucks.  Anyways,tonight my sis's boyfren was just showing me this cartoon called "xiaoxiao" stickman or something,its realy really funny.something like happy tree friends but the stick version,and with colour too,really funny,all the violence and stuff..then,there was just this particular one where they showed the miscaluculations for bungee jumping and then this stickman thing had like 6 ways of getting hurt,one was his legs tore apart from his body due to the force and pressure of jumping and he fell onto a cactus and died...and loads more.real funny.no use telling you,you should go catch it at... urlLink http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/bungee.php   Well,gota go now,was suppose to study history,looks like there ain't time left..  Tired too....see ya then.  Signing off.....Kimmified.&nbsp;&nbsp; :P  Take care ya'll

                Hello!     I just wrote a real long essay for the entry of blog and when I was editing it, it totally disappeared! I was so darn pissed, but never mind ,I’ve gotten over it, maybe its fate telling me that the seriousness of my topic was getting out of hand and that it should not be revealed to all reader out there..!haha.so well, you don’t gt to view it,althou I personally thought it was a bloody interesting article I wrote.unfortunatly,it went way!  My sister will be back tonight from Brisbane,Australia after a week of late and lonely nights,althou I didn’t feel that way because of my friends in school whom well,made me feel loved.hahaha,therefore a shout out to you guys : Thanks so much!love ya all!

Then the other show,pirates of the Caribbean was good…as mentioned in the entry before this,you would well read about *ahem some of the very visual descriptions I’ve made.haha      Naomi,Jamie and me were at Chinese class today and we were chatting about how friends pretend to be on good terms with each other and what the bad effects of it are.we also went on talking abt pads and tampons which was very interesting,althou Naomi was covering her ears and shouting “yucks!gross” and had all her shivery movements.haha.  Other than that,today’s a pretty cool day.temperature wise and the things occurring in the day itself.my window is wide open and the grills are like…god knows where!a bird could just fly in and use my bed as pooping grounds man!but you know me,if it does tt,I’ll catch that feela and squeeze it to death,after that I would eat it later tonight and maybe offer my sister some.haha.      Alrighty then,the day is growing late and I feel like gaming my age of empires.i shall do exactly that right now! Ciaoz.take care till next time!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loads of love, Kim          &nbsp;

                   Standing next to a bi-sexual person can do many things to you when you hate them...especially when you hate them.       I for one,have experience that with TJL yesterday.she pulled me aside IN THE MORNING,made me run 15 rounds ard 3 basketball courts,hold me up with her redundant and nonsense talk for at least,i timed,half an hour,practicallly wasting my bloody effort and time to stand there and miss maths lesson.Maths lessons are even more important than he-she. urlLink         Sometimes,when a teacher says she takes it as a i-care-for-you case    and not a disciplinary case,i get terribly suspicious..my thoughts are"what does she want from me?" (especially if its that he-she)and seriously,i wouldn't like being raped by a low down stupid scumbag like her/him (i still can't decide!).she is gross to look at,if people tell you they go all the way to thailand to look for them transvestite,well!Look no further,we have a very nice example in chij sec!    I don't know what she-he wants from people,popularity?   well,hell,if she wants to add me to her-he "worship me" list,she/he's gonna have to try damn hair-tearing hard cos she/he'll never get my attention.a few weeks ago,she attempted a "hi" situation with me,and me disliking her as it is wanted to VOMIT.if that she-he ever tries to touch me or even attempt to hold my arm or put her hand or my shoulder,i swear i'll scream like a ban-shee.knowing me,noone can really scream louder than that.   She really hates fat people and well loves to diss them and all this i care for you cases means she wants something from you...your body?your attention!Hell!she/he looks like she/he's about 90 years of age or freshly dug up from six feet under.when i look at her-he,i thank god I WAS FAT because if that thing meant for me to go thru taf and look like IT in the end,i rather kill myself.     Let me enlighten you on what blabbered to my face about.1st (I SHALL USE IT,ITS EASIER AND MEANS WHAT I REALLY MEAN)IT tells me to go run cos IT doesn't want to see my face,hell!i would run cos i don't want to see that piece of shit hole.then tells me to loose that doleful look cos it DOESN'T BECOME OF ME(to a bimbo,that's a real insult)..so i lose it.but then IT has a problem with my next expression...i get this(hahahahah) sentence from her "you wanna fight issit?"..god,i was filled with mirth,i could die laughing,it is such a fool sometimes.i wish i can tell it to wake up and decide about what type of sex it wants to be,not be a bloody amoeba.ok so i lose the wanna-fight look and guess what...it says that i have a defiant stance and attitude and look!LIKE WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE WANT ME TO LOOK?sorry?haha,over my dead body!i look sorry to people who i think deserve it because i know i WAS WRONG and that that person is at least making some sense to me.....    well she said excatly this and that was the last straw..."you reaked of defiance"..at that point i felt so bloody cool and about to burst out laughing.me?defiant?only to you sunny.       Anyways,enought about her,she's not worth my time...    my day was alright,we finally removed the wasp home thanks to ubi honey.this bloody hell shows that the office staff are INCOMPETENT.i reported that a home was in the making for 5 times.and no response and the lady at the office!gave me attitude,she said the man came and left!like f***ing hell,bring him back,its not my fault you shitting hell forgot!!Irresponsible....@#$%!#$.   now,TJL!this is what i call no integrity and responsiblilty and honour.not what you said,you make no sense when you talk to people,its like listening to my DOG BARK when i listen to you yappering away happily.       The wasp home was building up,as i said,many lavas came out and it was extremely disgusting,i wanted to PUKE.       I did kick boxing for taf today.at first,it seemed like it wasn't helping you lose weight but then somehow when you weren;t paying attention,you start to perspire like crazy.another comment to tjl's accomplice,this ugly bulky women at the brink of losing her feminity and turn into another TJL,yeah,noone needs a bodyguard to buy shorts,but she was just there to accompany,you don't know what a bodyguard is to a friend?so sorry,maybe that's how you landed up as a p.e teacher.besides,a word of warning,you're starting to get a tinge of tjl's style,terribly unhealthy.i suggest YOU DON'T MIX WITH HER.       Whoooo!Bitching sure feels good...haha,and to tell you the truth,i love it and never wanna stop.ahah.       Anyway!I have gotta go now,nuthing much to say about today thou!so sorry!Gotta study.       Give me a holla if you wanna!                                                                                            K.Kan               urlLink
