						   Well, after the interesting wedding, I went to my neighbors' party.  Katey was celebrating her 29th birthday and Terri, her partner, was celebrating becoming a Liscenced Independent Social Worker.  It was fun...had to stay away from food, but that was not too hard.  Tonight we are going to see  Footloose  at the  urlLink Covedale Center for the Performing Arts .  My little brother, Mark, is in it starring as Uncle Wes.  I am sure it is great, but I will let you know when I get back.  This week, I will start a little more indepth writing, so if you don't want to learn too much about me, turn back soon.

						   Yesterday was pretty uneventful.  I spent the morning studying and veggin', had lunch at CFC with Amy, took a nap before dinner, and went to Jeremy's surprise party at night.  I did have a good food day, and that is always welcome.  Today I have to play trumpet at a wedding.  I am not looking forward to it (Sorry, Stacey, if you read this).  At least it is in the afternoon.  But, it is downtown at St. Xavier Church and there is a Reds' game today.  Parking is going to blow!  After that, I am going to my neighbor Katie's birthday party.  She and her partner Terri have lived next door since we moved in.  Good peoples...  Well, I'll let you know how the day unfolds...

						      &nbsp;&nbsp;      These are two of my fat pics from the good-ole days.&nbsp; When I am down and feel like eating, I look at these.&nbsp; On the flip side, here is one of my recent not-so-fat pics-&nbsp;   That was taken on the Golden Princess on a recent cruise to the Southern Caribbean.

						   This is so frustrating.&nbsp; I have about 10 hours of work left on my degree and am having a hell of a time working.&nbsp; I get so tired and sidetracked.&nbsp; I have a pretty good system developed, but I am still getting sleepy while studying.  My last paper for this class has to be on how the bible has influenced a specific piece of media (TV show, movie, book, poem, etc.).&nbsp; I wanted to be original, so I did some research and found a good amount of articles on Terminator 2 being a christ-figure movie.&nbsp; We'll see about that!  If you read any of my blog, please post a comment so I can see who is reading about my life.

						   Last night was great!&nbsp; Amy, Simon, Sunny and I went hiking at Miami Whitewater State Forest in Harrison, Ohio.&nbsp; It was a great night to do it (low 70's) and boy what a workout.&nbsp; I had a great time!  I had a good food day yesterday.&nbsp; Only slipped up once, and corrected it later on.&nbsp; Amy and I have been having the same thing for breakfast for a week now (ham and cheese EggBeaters omlette and 1 slice of ham on the side), but today we went REALLY crazy and had hashbrowns, too.&nbsp; It amazes me that having that for breakfsat is less calories than a bowl of most cereals, including most Raisin Brans!  I am going up to have lunch with Amy today.&nbsp; That should be fun.&nbsp; It is nice going up to visit her at work because that is where I am going to be working in 30 days and I am so excited to start.  Well, I will check in later with another installment.

						   Lunch was good.&nbsp; As I said, I ate at Chipotle.&nbsp; I had a Burrito Bol with lettuce, chicken, fajita veggies, and a pinch of cheese.&nbsp; It was good...and only 8 points.  Now, my concentration for the afternoon MUST be on my classwork.&nbsp; I will let you know how that goes.

						     accurately journal  excercise for 60 minutes  work efficiently on everythinhg that I do   Today has been good so far.&nbsp; Of course, I have only been up for 2 hours.&nbsp; I want to make sure that I stick with the program today, so I am going to be blogging as often as possible.  Yesterday, I excercised twice, and it has been a LONG time since I did that.&nbsp; I may take Simon and Sunny for a walk again this afternoon...they sure do need the excercise.  I am going out to lunch with Jeremy and Dave today...it should be a good time.&nbsp; Chipotle is not too hard to count points at; I will probably just have a fajita bowl with no cheese...I still like that a lot.  Well, I am off to work on my class.&nbsp; I need to finish that A.S.A.P.

						   I just got back from&nbsp;a 30 minute walk with Sunny and Simon.&nbsp; He was exhausted, but she kept on going.&nbsp; I walked my buns off, hopefully.  I am very disappointed that I gained so much this past week.&nbsp; I guess that I should have seen it coming with the way that I ate, but I guess I just never believed that it would happen.&nbsp; I always amaze myself in the way that I can completely ignore reality and believe that I will have magically lost weight.  At one point, I was down to 275...actually 273.&nbsp; I am now at 299, as of Monday night.&nbsp; SO, what have I done to remedy that:   More excercise  More mental work (aka. blogging and studying)  Eat less (I don't quite have the hang of that one, but I am working on it)   So,&nbsp; I need to figure out what my weight loss goals are:   I want to lose 2 pounds per week  That means about 8-10 pounds per month  It means that I would hit 230 in approx. 30 weeks  That would be that by&nbsp;April 1st, I would weigh 230 pounds.   My intermediate goals are as following:   289 by the time I start at CFC  273 by Halloween  265 by Thanksgiving  257 by Christmas  243 by Valentines Day  230 by April 1st   I can do that.&nbsp; I pray that I can do that.&nbsp; Father in haeven, please help me have the stamina and strength tostay on track with my health plan.&nbsp; I have started so many times...let this be the last start.

						   Well, this weekend was not easy. Let me start with Friday and work my way to now. I know that I haven't been blogging enough, so for that , I apologize. I would be whole-heartedly surprised if anyone noticed, but this helps me to stay honest, so here goes.  Friday night I DJed at the Phoenix with my wife Amy. It was not bad: the Phoenix OR DJing with Amy. It is relatively easy to load in and out of with an alley elevator. The Room (The Archway Ballroom) was nice and the gig itself was easy.  Saturday...OH, Saturday! What a crappy day that was. First, I get up to drive over and borrow Tom's (my father-in-law) 1989 Dodge Ram truck. It is in great condition and runs wonderfully, but it was going to be mean to me all day.  I went to pick up the truck that I had rented from Home Depot, and it was MUCH bigger than I had anticipated! It was 6'x10', but I swear it looked bigger! It handled fine, but it took me 5 passes and a spotter to park the thing in my driveway whilst I blocked up traffic.  After going through the rest of my day and getting ready for the gig that night, I got in the truck to run to Roger Bacon (my FORMER employer) and pick up some speakers that Jeremy had left there after a dance in the end of May. I put the key in the ignition, turned it and, you guessed it, nothin'! The battery was D-E-A-D, dead!  It took me about an hour to get it jumped, because regular cables wouldn't do it and my neighbor just happened to have high-voltage cables! I went to pick up my brother, Matt, who was going to be helping me Saturday, picked up the equipment at Jeremy's, and went to the Fairfield Banquet Facility to set up. When we got there and walked in, we were greeted by a very rude, and frankly quite unintelligent, female caterer. She wouldn't even give me table clothes for there tables!  Well, after we loaded in, I went to start the truck to park it in the lot away from the hall, and it wouldn't start. Luckily, I was on a slight incline and was able to coast down to the lot. After DJing, however, I had to be jumped by my client...very embarrassing.  During the gig, Matt found out that his wife, Jenny (nee Gohs), had locked their keys in their apartment. So, when we finally got home, I had to go over to Matt's and cut the screen to get into his apartment through the window.  Saturday was finally over. I thought that the hardest part of my weekend was ending with the stroke of midnight.   Boy, was I wrong.     Amy and I had decided that we of were going to try a different church this weekend. I had been very frustrated with the boringness Catholic Services, and Amy was willing to go to The  urlLink Vineyard Community Church  with me. We met my Uncle Jerry and Aunt Maria there, and I loved the service. So did Amy, but not the extent that I did. I felt whole and completed spiritually by the service; Amy felt like she hadn't really gone to a service.  We fought off and on all day, until I realized that I was not fighting a fight that I wanted to win. I wanted to be happy and spiritually fulfilled, and I was. This did not mean that I had to abandon my Catholic roots (yet...this is a subject for a later post), but that I now had something to supplement the faith that I want to build.  So, eventually, I think that I got that across to Amy. Maybe not in so many words, but close.  This weekend we are going to Massilon for my cousin Jeff's wedding. I will be DJing that, too. Should be interesting.    Dear Lord,     Thank you for continuing to give me challenges in life so that I may learn from my struggles. Thank you for all of the generous gifts you have bestowed me and for all of the things that I take for granted in my life. Lord Jesus, help me to have the strength to continue on my faith journey and resist the temptations that you put to me as a test.          Bless you, Lord!

						    Dear Lord,      Please help me this weekend to fend off temptation.  It seems that every corner that I turn presents a new challenge, and I want to have the stregth to push those aside and be me.      Lord Jesus, please help me in my time of need...

						   Well, for the next two evenings, my life will be consumed with the entertainment of others.  That actually sounds like what I do with me entire life, but hey, who cares.  Tonight, I DJ the "Dr. Robin" party.  It is the celebration of Robin Arthur gaining her PhD...I think.   It is being held at  urlLink The Phoenix , so that should be pretty cool.  I also get to DJ with my wife, Amy.  That should be interesting and fun.  Tomorrow, I am DJing the 21st (?) reunion of Northwest High School's Class of 1983.  THt will also be...interesting.  Reunions always include drunk, rude people.  I am still going strong with staying on course with WW and excercise.  I am going to go workout after lunch today.

						   Since I am busy, I don't have time to write a blog today...right now.  SO, I thought that I would post one of my assignments from my final undergrad class, which I finish this week.  So here you go:  Throughout the entire bible, fire is used as a symbol for many things, but mainly as a symbol of judgment.  How appropriate and predictable then is the use of fire in the Book of Revelation.  However, before we delve into the book in question, let’s set up this use of fire from previous examples in the bible.  Throughout my readings in this class, I have encountered the use of fire.  Luckily for me, many intelligent men and women have invented biblical concordances.  In the Torah, fire is the main way in which God manifests himself on earth.  Some examples being the covenant with Abraham (Gen. 15:17),  the burning bush (Ex. 3:2-4), the pillar of fire (Ex. 13:21), and on Mt. Sinai (Ex.19:18).  From the very beginning then, the authors of the bible have set up fire as a symbol of God himself.  Fire is also used during many sacrifices, either as the way in which the sacrifice is offered (Ex. 12:8,9,10; Lev. 1), or as the way that Yahweh accepts the offering (1 Kin. 18:38; 1 Chr. 21:26).  Incense, also present in the Book of Revelation, is another way in which fire manifests itself in the bible.  Incense’s main use is in burning to fragrance the air.  This, obviously, involves fire.  In the Book of Revelation, fires main use is to be symbolic of the power of the Son of Man.  The first mention of this is when the prophet/author John turns to hear the voice of the one who is delivering the message to him.  In Revelation 1:14, John says “His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.”  I love the vision that this creates!  These pure features of white set-off by burning eyes of fire.  This vision is reiterated to the people of Thyatira in the Son of Man’s address to them (2:18).  The only other mention of fire in His seven addresses is in the message to the people of Laodicea (3:18).  He encourages them to by their gold from him: “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.”  What I believe the Son of Man is trying to say here is that the gold (life) that I can give you is far stronger than the gold (wealth) that you seek on earth.  The next six references to fire are all in reference to the same topic: The Seven Spirits (or Angels) of God (4:5; 8:4,7,8,9; 9:17).  These are the angels that carry out all of the apocalyptic judgments upon the earth.  At first, they are described as “seven lamps of fire burning before the throne” (4:5).  Later on, in Revelation 5, these are the same Spirits which are said to be the eyes of the Lamb; the Lamb being the only thing in existence which can open the scroll held by  “him that sat on the throne.”  This draws us back to the first reference in Revelations, making me believe that the flames in his eyes were the Spirits all along.  The next mention of fire is definitely my favorite.  When describing the two witnesses that will proclaim the word of God to the people, it is said that “if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies (11:5).  It may be the pyromaniac adolescent male in me, but this image personifies the power of God to me.  He can give two men the ability to smote enemies of His word.  The next couple of references use fire in the description of The Beast and it’s actions.  Although fire is not directly mentioned, using the image of a red dragon to be The Beast makes one automatically think of fire-breathing (12:3).  Also, as a sign of his power, The Beast calls fire from the sky (13:3).  Once again, the Angels of Judgment are the ones who use fire repeatedly.  When pouring out the bowl judgments, the Spirits us fire to punish those with the mark of the Beast (14:10) and the Angel who controls the fire gives orders to the ones with scythes to harvest the earth (14:18).  Finally, the image of fire returns again to this majestic white figure with flaming eyes (19:12).  Over the final 3 chapters, this Rider uses fire and the Lake of Fire to punish the non-believers (those not in the book of life), the Beast and his false prophet, and finally, the devil himself.  To me, the Book of Revelation’s use of fire is symbolic of God’s ability to judge and judge fairly.  Those who do believe in him are spared the burning of their flesh (16:8) among other things.  In the eyes of the Rider, the fire is at home as the instruments with which Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, can judge his people in his Kingdom on earth.

						   Two of my favorite shows on television are  urlLink  Extreme Makeover: Home Edition   and  urlLink  The Amazing Race 5  . The two shows are so well done.  First on,  at 8:00p  last night, was  Extreme Makeover: Home Edition . I love this show! They take the house of a family that is in need, or has had an extreme kind of obstacle to overcome, and completely redo the whole property FREE OF CHARGE. Not only that, but they seriously trick out the yards, garages, and in the case of the Mendozas last night, their car. It is so neat to watch a family that deserves it getting such a great present.  The best part of last night is when the contractors that were in charge of the project offered a job to the eldest son in the family: something that he desperately needed and wanted. I really do not like  Extreme Makeover , but ABC has hit the nail on the head with  EM:HE!     At 10:00p, my favorite reality show EVER comes on: The Amazing Race. Now, for those of you who have never seen this before, it is like a combination between  Survivor ,  Around the World In 80 Days , and  The X-games . It is a measure of endurance, intelligence, and team work like I have never seen on TV. Click the link above to learn more.  My favorite team this year would have to be  urlLink Mirna & Charla . At first, it was because I thought that it was novel that Charla was a dwarf; now it is amazing to see that she is just as capable, if not more so, of doing all of the required tasks as all of the other people. In the first show she carried a side of beef across a town!  On to aerobics...HOLY SHIT BATMAN! I have never had a workout like that...EVER! I did an 11:30a-12:30p  urlLink Reebok Step  class at the  urlLink Gamble-Nippert Y.M.C.A.  on the westside on Cincinnati, Ohio. It totally kicked my ass.  But at the same time, I loved it. It was exhausting and invigorating at the same time. I feel great about having done it. I was going to skip it today...honestly. But I got thinking about how I did not want to be a quitter this time. I have always been a quitter...my entire life. Being a quitter is not something that I am going to be ever again.  I have been getting thoughts about eating food that I don't journal today and I don't like it. I have worked SO HARD for the past 10 days and I feel like I am really making a breakthrough.   Lord,   Give me the strength to carry on through this just as you gave strength to the chosen after Jesus ascended into heaven. They had so much more of a burden on their backs and all that I have is 70 pounds. If they can take the message of our Lord to non-believers and make them whole, I can take the message of health to my body and save my life.      I pray this through Jesus Christ,   AMEN      From time to time, you may see me pray in my blog. I invite you to pray for me and ask that you do.

						   I lost 4.6 pounds last week.  I guess that all of that hard work and determination really did pay off.  It really feels good to know that if you stick to a plan, you see results.  As for the bummed, I forgot about a DJ gig this Saturday night and have to miss Amy's August meeting party.  I am so upset that I let her down.  I wish that there was a way that I could make it up to her.

						   Ever since I was a young boy, I can remember running to food for comfort, boredom, protection, and the list goes on. I would sneak food into my room, eat extra at meals, everything that you can think of, I have done it.  One particular instance I remember was when I was going to a Boy Scout meeting on my bike. My church was about 1/2 mile south of a Taco Bell, so I rode my bike up to buy 2 Chilitos (or a chili-cheese burrito) and 2 orders of nachos. I would have been between 10 and 12 at the time.  I must have left early and stolen some money from my Mom's purse. When I got there, I was standing in line at the counter when I heard my name frm the kitchen...at least I thought it was from the kitchen. It turned out that my Mom had decided to by Taco Bell for my family's dinner and I had been caught red-handed. I don't remember what happened to me that day, but I am sure that it wasn't pretty.  Honestly, I do not remember a whole lot about my childhood. I remember names and faces of friends, family get togethers, some Halloweens, and a couple isolated incidents, but, in general, I believe that I have suppressed most of my memories of my childhood on Bryn Mawr Dr.  I believe the reason for this is that I had so many bad times. Don't get me wrong; I was born into a wonderful, supportive family that loved me very much, but I was F A T! Both of my parents were a little haevy, so it was not a surprise, I guess.  I remember eating chips in my room, hiding Doritos in my closet, and even asking kids at school for thier extra food. But, most of all, what I really remember is that feeling that you don't have any friends. I would hang out with people, but I never felt like anybody's friend.  When high school started, is was pretty much the same deal, with the exception that I ate MORE!  I was mobile and had a job.  That meant lots of fast food.  Sometimes $10 in one day.  After I met my wife, Amy, and she discovered my eating disorder, she helped me get to somewhere that I thought would help.  It was called Acoria and it was supposed to help binge eaters.  Well, it didn't help me.  At one point, I weighed in at 365 pounds.  As I continued to struggle, Amy gained a good amount of weight also and pretty soon I was a size 54 pants and Amy was a size 14/16 dress.  That needed to change.  3 years ago we joined Weight Watchers after I had a particularly bad day at work.  We went that night and weighed in.  By last Christmas, Amy had lost 40 pounds and kept it off and I had lost 80 pounds and was livin' it up on my way to 230 pounds.   But, life had other plans.  As my profile says, I used to be a high school band director.  Let me say that as much as I do miss the kids, I do not miss that job 1 little iota.  It was torture.  As I struggled at work, the stress caused me to struggle with my weight and by just one week ago, I had gained back 25 pounds.  For the past 2 weeks, I have reaffirmed my goals and have worked hard to achieve them.  Why food?  Why, when I was a child, did I run to the refridgerator for comfort.  THe answer is I don't really know why I started.  Through therapy, I have discovered that the reason that I still struggle is that this "devious" side of me continues to battle for control.  I used to try to supress it, but now I know that I need to have a dialogue with it to make sure that it understands that I have the same goal in mind that it does and that I want to ge there a different way.  So, that is the Reader's Digest version of my food story.  Stay tuned tonight for the weigh-in results.

						   Today started out like my favorite kind of Sunday, a lazy one.  We got up, had pancakes, then went to 10:15a mass.  After I took communion to Robert (my homebound friend), we stopped by Matt (my step-cousin) and Alicia's place to drop of the wedding invitation binders. (FYI- I run a wedding planning business called big day, ink.)  Then, off to my brother Mark's birthday party followed by a 60 minute aerobic workout at the YMCA.  It felt great.  After Amy and I continued our baby-making attempts, we had a nice dinner and a relaxing evening.  All in all, a great day.  Tomorrow: deep philisophical thoughts...
