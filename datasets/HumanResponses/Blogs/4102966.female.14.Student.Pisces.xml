      hallo readers. I'm trying to do too many things at once!! Think AND type. So really, it isn't true, Alan, girls really aren't that good. So yeah, I guess I should tell you about my day. Well today..today.. not much has really happened. I ate alotta crap. Hahaha, that reminds me, Georgia got this icy pole and that was just what it looked like. Hahaha, and icy POLE. hahaha, I really should get a life. Anyway I really DISLIKE *dislike being a toned down version of what i could have said* two particular girls at school. Actually I dislike more, but they're not the one's i'm annoyed at, at the moment. Well these two people, Fujiko, I know I shouldn't say so, but I mean really. I have nothing against them, but it seems they think I'm weird and annoying. And it's not like when you go, haha, you're so weird. It's more of, OMG you're so weird and annoying. *sigh* I really try not to get angry, seeing as that will just satisfy them, but I don't know if I can hold myself back if they say anymore about me. So anyway, I'll talk to you later. I don't know who "you" are but anywho, talk to "you" later. Kimo

      Well, since no-one's really going to read this, what's the point? This is stupid, 'coz even I have trouble finding this. So anyway if you do read this, then hmmm... i can't do a thumbs up, but that's what I'm doing to the screen so just imagine it in your head. How come my thing doesn't look as good as Angela's?!! Bloody hell. And why don't the school computers don't even let me get into my MSN group? Oh yeah, join my group:  urlLink http://groups.msn.com/allhailme  Yeah. I joined Angela's forum about manga and crap. What the hell? I can't even do anything on it. They tell me off for doing nothing!! Stupid mods. It's even worse than gaia. Yeah I'm in IT again. I have one of these thingys on Xanga and I can't remember how to post. Anyway, gotta go and do maths. yay. what fun!! Kimo

      Yeah, i know those last ones probably didn't make sense, but i didn't know they BOTH worked. Yeah well last night we won our debating!! YEAH!! And  I was totally ripped off!! The bloody guy was such a suck. He was totally flirting/ sucking up to a girl off the other team just 'coz her dad is like his teacher or something. So rude. And they started AGREEING with us. AND one girl just read off her cards and didn't even look up. The worst thing is that I totally prepared and everything and i got the same points as an under-prepared team. Ripped off to the max. Anyway, I wasn't as nervous as last time. Thanx Mrs Hicks. Yeah so anyway, I haven't been on MSN in 2 days. Wow. I'm in IT, this is so boring. That works on 2 levels. THIS is boring and so is IT. Yeah I'm sorry this is boring, you really don't have to read it. That reminds me, I haven't written in my actual diary for a while... Kimo.

      Hi, I'm really hungry and I can smell food, but it's upstairs and the computer's downstairs. Nothing much has happened today, except I've had heaps of homework over the weekend and it's sunday night so naturally I think i'll start on it. Have to go, I really need to do my homework.
