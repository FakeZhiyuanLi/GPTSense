      Well, I've hopped squarely onto the bandwagon and moved my journal over to  urlLink here , since Indecent Blogging is adult oriented. This way, I'm not breaking any rules or risking the deletion of all my delectable musings.    xoxo,   urlLink pomegranate

      He is so cruel and has no clue. Last night while snuggling on the couch, he kept playfully pushing his foot up against my crotch, pressing the seam of my pants against my clit. I told him, he laughed and then went to bed. I had trouble falling asleep last night, you can imagine.

      Having a few hours to myself, with no chores or errands to run, you can imagine what I got up to. I lay myself down on our overstuffed, half-reclining futon, with my legs up in the air and my hips tilted at a delicious angle. Licking my fingers and diddling my clit, I plunged my dildo deep into my eager pussy and melted away into my fantasy ... I have this reacurring fantasy about being tied up and taken by a large number of men and women. I imagine that I am strapped down onto a table - usually at a kinky banquet or orgy party - blindfolded and dressed only in  wrist and ankle cuffs. Throughout the evening, the guests come to admire and abuse me, either by forcing me to suck their cocks or by fucking me.  So, as I lay there, pounding away at myself with my delightfully realistic dong, I imagined that it was the dick of some anonymous man delighting in my bound body. Before long, I'm moaning and groaning and whimpering, imagining myself being violated and loving it. And then my climax sweeps me away and I'm cumming and crying out and quaking. And now, I am relaxed and languid and fresh from the shower, ready to get on with the rest of my day ...

      Well, I'm home from my appointment and have the house to myself for another 2 hours or so. So, you can imagine what I am up to. As in, right now. I'm a one-handed typing whiz, at least until the typos start giving me away. The situation: on the desk in front of me I have my tiny, treasured vibrator, my intimidating but tasty dildo, and a bottle of lube.  As for myself, I've got my skirt hiked up to my hips, a set of clamps pinching my swollen lips (sometimes a little pain can feel just right) and a lightly lubed finger tip teasing and flicking my clit. It's all about the one-handed typing.  The thing with me is that I am no good at the slow build up. My head is always filled with such lewd things that I'm pretty much always aroused. So, once I go to it, like right now, there's no stopping it. I am dripping and rocking, as I type this. I know I'm breathing faster. I keep bringing myself right to the edge and backing off, I want to savour this and record it - if I can stay focused. It's always been easier for me to orgasm through clitoral stimulation, although the few  really  mind-blowing orgasms I've had were vaginal. I love a little pain and usually pinch or clamp my clit and lips until they hurt too much ... Inevitably, though, I'll tease myself past my point of self-control and it's all downhill from there. The hips and knees start shaking, I start riding my finger, or dildo, or whatever harder and faster. It starts in my belly, like the warmth from a shot of liquor and spreads like white noise as the pleasure builds ... until ...  The world falls away and I cease to exist. There's nothing but pleasure.   And then, just as suddenly, the world picks up where it left off and I return to myself.   And then, slowly it builds until I am ready to go again ...

      We watched  urlLink The Piano Teacher  last night. It was certainly disturbing. I won't go into details, if you've seen it, you know. However, I must admit there was this one part that I found quite arousing. When Walter and Erika are in the bathroom and she is giving him a handjob, I found myself becoming flushed and tingly. It was so out of place in such an otherwise disturbing and upsetting movie, I am still pondering it.  Last night, as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep, I replayed that one scene over and over in my head, with myself instead of Isabelle Huppert of course. I varied it, sometimes making poor Walter jerk-off for me with the bathroom door open, sometimes letting him fuck me on a sink, even inviting a third male student - maybe the singer? - to join in by taking Walter from behind while I watched and maybe sucked his cock.  Thinking about it again is stirring me up again, the lips of my sex are starting to tingle and I can feel my clit throbbing. And I have no time to delve into this fantasy this morning. But knowing I'm going to be suffering and distracted somehow just makes it sweeter. I'll be back, Walter my love.

      I'm a bad girl. I love to frequent the masturbation oriented chat rooms at  urlLink SOI . This is the closest I've come - and possibly would want to come - to masturbating with total strangers. No matter how I might feel in the heat of the moment, I would never cheat. But I like to look. And I like to toe the line. Somehow  online  is not quite real. I can chat with, and get off with, a safe, anonymous stranger and not feel the twinge of a guilty conscience. I would love to meet some people - online - to chat about masturbation and fantasies, but I don't know if this is possible. I don't want to make online wank-buddies. I want to meet people who can talk maturely and eloquently about their own fantasies and experiences masturbating. To hear about what turns them on and how that feels. My partner has his own kinks, which I support even though I don't necessarily share. And I know he doesn't really share my enthusiasm for self-pleasure.   Guess we're really a 21st century couple. It feels a bit like a tightrope act, especially when my jealousy surges, knowing he's been chatting with his Mistress (in the BDSM sense of the word, please). But, that's a role I can't fulfill and I don't want to deny him of it. Now I guess it's time for me to find and foster my own circle of like-minded folk.   Viva la masturbation!

      God, I am so horny today. I must be ovulating. I feel expansive and am revelling in my fertility and fecundity. I feel like some jungle plant, moist and shining and sticky. With a musky scent and delicate blossoms beginning to open. Who knew plants could be so fucking sexy? Actually, after a visit to a local orchid show, I came away feeling more than a little titilated and somewhat scandilized by some of the flowers. Like being witness to prominent sex organs on an animal. Not really sure how to respond, but definitely responding. And now, I feel totally wound up. I want to run outside, strip off all my clothes and offer my body to the first man that comes along. I want to feel that glistening cock pounding into me, splitting me open until my honey spills out and annoints the ground. I want to be had. Repeatedly. Forcefully. I want to be owned, contained and tamed. I want someone to quench this writhing sexiness that's coiled like a serpent in the pit of my belly. God, I want to be  fucked .
