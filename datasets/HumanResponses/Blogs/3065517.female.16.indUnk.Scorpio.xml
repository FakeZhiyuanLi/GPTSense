Ill never get past 16 I want to make it in this world and I know that now. But no one can help me I have to do it on my own. IM starting over things are going to get better from here. I can feel it. I CAN FEEL IM off all medication and I can feel everything! everything I missed feeling I can feel it again. I forgot how good this feels. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD BEGINNING IM going to go before I start over analyzing.

YET! IM not forgiving her. SORRY isn't going to do a damn thing. I guess in a certain way IM really mad at myself, for telling her all of that. I couldn't stop myself she's the only one that can bring my little kid guilty conscence up to the surface. When I don't tell her the truth or I leave shit out I get, my guilt back. That hasn't happened since I was really little.  when I was little and I would do something wrong and wont tell my mother I was start to get really sick mental and physically it was so bad that I would end up breaking down and freaking out. So as u can see I hated getting in trouble when I was younger, until one day when my mom said that I didn't have to tell her everything and its ok to make mistakes as long as u just didn't do it again. That little statement allowed me to do what I do to day. So ivy been guilt free ever since then until Allison. when i was little and even now there was nothing that i hated more than feeling guilty. so yeah i was just thinking about that and i really had to say it. ok so im done being a jerk.  // posted by Hannah Bear @ 8:32 AM (0) comments Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  FUCK YOU ALLISON I got home yesterday and my mom said that Allison's dad Ken called them yesterday, and said that Allison and him were very worried about me. Fuck that! I know she cares but there's a difference between feeling suicidal and jumping off the mother fucking bridge. IM really pissed I guess I just have to be careful about what I say to her, that is if IM going to write to her anytime soon IM really mad at her. I think IM not going to write her because for one thing the letters are being screened again, cuz the last letters she's been sending me always tend to make me depressed and cut. And I guess my one letter to her where I was trying to be truthful cuz IM guilt was overwhelming me, just made her think I was going to try to jump of the bridge. I sent that letter after she had sent me one talking about how she wants me to be honest with her and how she's honest with me. Her letters make me really upset, IM never going to tell her that but they really do. IM her other letter she was talking about how she has become obsessed with cutting again. She hasn't cut yet but she's always thinking about it. And she kept saying shit like this " this all just doesn't seem worth it. I'm starting to get disgusted by life. It's not all what I thought it would be. If this is how life is then I'm not sure I want to live it..... This way." then she goes on saying " but I don't want to upset U. IM sorry if I have." She's sorry? No I don't think she's sorry. You cant say something like that and expect a word like sorry is going to fix it...Because its not. So yeah Fuck You Allison. I was dealing with my own shit just fine don't bring other people into it. I know I have issues but u don't have to make them so fucking obvious.  // posted by Hannah Bear @ 7:01 AM (0) comments Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Monday, May 24, 2004 I NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH THEY ALL MEAN TO ME NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY. When I was at Amys house we would always listen to Sarah McLachlan, and Allison whether she knew it or not would sing the Angel song to the both of us. But the song Fallen when ever I hear it means so much but its not that it makes me cry it just makes me remember how things used to be. When things were really good. I'd give anything to go back to that. Everything was getting better from there. But now its kind of stuck. I made a contract with Ms.Reed on Friday it says that I must be clean and sober for the rest of middle school and summer. I signed it so I'm going to try real hard to do it, for everyone. Well everyone except for me. I never do things for me just other people.   // posted by Hannah Bear @ 8:02 AM (0) comments Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Friday, May 21, 2004 MY LIFE IS STARTING TO RHYME WITH FUCK...  so IM sitting here listening to Angel and crying. IT reminds me of yesteryear when she would sing to me and then everything would be alrite. But everythings different now, and I hate it. I hate that she's not here I want her back so much. But I want her to get better, yet I want to be able to see her. It hurts to much sometimes. So I got two letters from her yesterday. That kind of helped, I mean don't get me wrong I love hearing from her but her letters are so sad, and they make me really upset at times. Well lately they always seem to make me cry. It always seems like IM crying. I hate crying, it sucks it doesn't even help anymore. I don't think anythings going to help not some residential program in Maine. NOTHING.   Angel by Sarah McLachlan Spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okay there's always one reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release memory seeps from my veins let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there  so tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back and the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lie that you make up for all that you lack it don't make no difference escaping one last time it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here    // posted by Hannah Bear @ 8:02 AM (0) comments Comment (0) | Trackback (0)  Tuesday, May 18, 2004 MY SOUL IS BLEEDING AND ITS ALL YOUR FAULT Grr Girls are mean at least the ones that I thought were my friends. I think I'm almost to ashamed to be one. I hate that I was that back stabbing once. I wish I could make all my wrongs right.  Their taking me off my Meds to quickly. I feel like I'm going to faint all the time. And I'm really depressed more than I have been lately. I told my doctor she said not to do anything stupid while I'm in the transition of getting used to my real emotions. Wow can I really handle faking my emotions by myself. I don't want to go to a residential even though I know I really need it. But id lose so much and I think id gain so little. Without my meds I cant pretend to be happy anymore, and that's the only thing keeping me away from residential. Allison said if she needs to be in one I for sure need to be in one. I'm glad she has so much faith in me. Although I don't have faith in me just in other people. That's as far as it goes for me.  I cant go to Piedmont its going to be to emotionally hard for me to deal with the reputation that people have given me. Its enough that I have 100 something kids talking about my life but if u add 200 or 300 more to that... I don't even want to think about it. I want to start off fresh were I can make better decisions and better friends. I have a few really good friends that know everything but then there are all the rumors that have burned holes through my soul. So yes you have penetrated me, my soul, I'm bleeding. Are u happy yet? Now can u leave me alone and let me dye in peace. All I want is for this teenage drama to go away,for my girl to come back and be better and happy, and to me to be happy with myself and stable for me and for her. I want to care enough for me, first. But right now she's all I think I have to live for as well as Ms.Reed and Maddy and G and Sarah and Paul and Kates. My soul is bleeding are u happy now I'm crying.I fell in love I cant help it. STOP ABUSING ME!Sunday, April 25, 2004 how i dance and stumble between the extremes of emotions. sometimes i am terribly happy to be alive - and happy that i am, i am. so happy that i feel like i'd burst out of existence. such joy, such happiness! landing like snow is a delicious obligation to worship god, to kiss its feet and thank it for giving life. now it is natural to wear a broad smile and to love people because they are. understanding the world comes as the simplest task. the past no longer harnesses my being, because i am completely subsumed into the moment: the moment and nothing else. i have the power to push everything else behind the realm of consciousness. to concentrate, to shoot in glitter and be dazzled and blind in the moment of happiness.   but all end in a flutter; all are but a fleeting moment. they flicker before fading out for the final. and really that is it. thrust into the world of darkness (it is so familiar yet strange) i find myself standing alone, only alone, always and ever, deliriously hoping that my existence would fucking smoulder out someday, so silently and unnoticiably, like the way the rain stops, or how the coal turns itself white.    as the cycle ripens, i become afraid of feeling happy, or the happiness itself. the fear is for the knowledge that there's another round of darkness waiting around the corner, which would come to smother & overwhelm me for another ruthless and helpless hours; for the knowledge of the hours i have endured and survived; and that i must prepare for another round. or how i should prepare, really.    ... i confess. i am afraid of everything.  // posted by Hannah Bear @ 10:24 PM Comments (2) | Trackback (0)  FUCK MY life is making me angry well at least at the moment. humm i hate Graham he makes my life a living hell. he always finds a way to make my day really shity.
