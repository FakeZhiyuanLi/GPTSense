						    Waring: Since I am Fametracker's bitch, I will be talking about that site alot in my blog. I plan on talking about my crushes on other posters and funny quotes. So if you don't like it, stay the hell away from my blog. Hee, I say that like anyone reads this shit.      Anyways, my  urlLink Fametracker  crush of the week if OriginalCalvin. He (or possibly she, I'm not sure yet) used to be just Calvin, but when the forums got new software s/he was unable to register under that name. Sometimes it's really hard to explain why you have a crush on someone so the best way for you to understand my current undying love for someone I've never met (and could be a serial killer with a talent for snark for all I know) is to read the Britney Spear's thread at Fametracker. I dare you to go in there and not laugh, snort and occasionally be disgusted for hours on end.      But I warn you, if you haven't been keeping up with the thread or are brand new to  urlLink Fametracker  make sure you give yourself a good long weekend to read the whole thing. It's completely worth it though, I promise you.      Anywhooty, TTFN.   EDITED: OriginalCalvin is male and straight, cuz I know you were dying to know. ANOTHER EDIT: He's also attatched, but his signifigant other said she thought Catwoman looked like it might be good when she saw the trailer, so there's hope for me yet! Or at least until my next crush, which given my fickle nature could be any day now.

						    I would like at announce that I have officially decided to become a gold digger. I don't want to marry some old rich man, but I am sick of being broke. I will figure out how to entice men to take me to fancy restaurants where I will eat caviar and drink champagne from bottle who's names I cannot pronounce. I will vacation on a yatch off the coast of Italy and have a closet full of beautiful designer clothing. I will drive a lovely sports car and&nbsp;spend the day lunching with the girls and getting facials and&nbsp;massages at the spa.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sounds fabulous already.

						    I wonder if people actually read this. I'm not even sure if I want them to. It's like my own public therapy session.    &nbsp;  I've decided to try and do one fabulous fun thing a week. Even if it's just chilling at an outdoor cafe or buying a yummy lipstick. I'm also going to try and go out once a week by myself, to see a movie or go to dinner. Something, it doesn't matter once, as long as it's just for me. I've never had a problem going to the movies or out to eat by myself, it can be very relaxing.

						    I'm thinking of becoming a vegetarian. I was vegan until I was 15. I was against animal testing and was very vocal about it. I was also anti-abortion and anti-death penalty. I've since outgrown those polictical views.     &nbsp;   The original reason&nbsp;I was going to stop eating meat is because it's cheaper. I am one broke ass bitch. I have a child to support and don't get child support because my ex husband doesn't have a job.     &nbsp;   I went onto  urlLink Peta's website  and order a free vegetarian starter kit. There was a link to a video of chicken's being abused at some plant. It made me sick to my stomach and brought back some of the moral outrage I had in my youth. This has reinforced my decision to stop eating meat.

						    I don't like to tan.  At all.  So I am very pale. My legs are very scary. But I am obsessed with my skin so I wear sunscreen every day. I also moisturize and use and eye cream, even though I'm only 26.     &nbsp;   I read a lot. I'll read almost anything if I'm bored. Once my friends and I were waiting to get back across the border from Mexico and the line was as usual really long. I found a bible in my friend's glove compartment and started reading it. I'm not religious and my friends thought it was funny as hell.     &nbsp;   I have really weak fingernails. They break all the time. I've tried acrylics, but they lift. My cuticles are always ragged too. Can fabulous women have ugly nails?     &nbsp;   That's it for now. Off to  urlLink Fametracker  I go.        &nbsp;

						    I know you are dying to know why I decided to start a blog, so here are the reasons.     &nbsp;   1) Everyone has one and I want to hang with the cool kids.    2) I want to believe that there are people who actually care about what I think or say, even if it's not true.    3) I need something to do at work other than spending time on  urlLink Fametracker .    4) I've decided to change my life and chronicle those changes here, because it would be a social disservice not to let y'all follow me down the road of becoming fabulous.     &nbsp;   That's right. I want to become fabulous. Unfortunately there are many obstacles in my path.     &nbsp;   The biggest is that I'm a single parent. I  DO NOT  resent my daughter at all, and love her more than life itself. But she is my number one priority so that leaves very little time for hanging out in swanky lounges and sipping martinis with hot Italian men until 2am. I also have to make sure she is fed and clothed properly which leaves very little money left over for, well anything.     &nbsp;   I used to be fabulous before I became a mommy. I used to live in Ft. Lauderdale and partied every single day. I'm not looking to do that anymore (I'm too old to be going to be hanging out in some club on Garnet or Grand anyways) but I wish my life was a little more Sex and the City and a little less lackluster. So ladies and gentlemen I have decided to change that. Mommies can be fabulous!!     &nbsp;   My problem? I have no fucking clue about how to change my life. Pathetic right? But I'm stumped. I know I need to start eating better and lose weight. I need to develop a better sense of style. I  used to  have a pretty good one. Now I look like a soccer mom. But when you can only afford to shop at Target you're options are pretty limited.     &nbsp;   But I will persevere. I will become gorgeous and witty and charming. People will gawk at me when I walk down the street. Strangers in restaurants will send champagne to my table in hopes that I will smile at them. I will receive beautiful bouquets of flowers at work on a regular basis.     &nbsp;   A girl can hope right?

						    Some stuff about me.     &nbsp;   I'm really messy. So messy I don't even like living with myself. I saw this special on TV once about people who's houses should be condemned.&nbsp;Their houses were filled with trash and newspapers from 1983 because they can't throw anything away. You could hardly walk it was so bad. They had some kind of mental disorder that prevented them from cleaning.     &nbsp;   That's me. I'm not nearly that bad but I think I have a mild form of that disorder. I cannot be neat to save my life. Even when I try really hard to. It's a running joke in my family.     &nbsp;   I'm addicted to the forums at  urlLink Fametracker . Seriously addicted. Someone needs to stage an intervention. I don't know how I get any work done. If you haven't been on Fametracker, check it out. But don't say I didn't warn you.     &nbsp;   The love of my life is my daughter. She's six and manages to simultaneously filled my heart with love and drive me absolutely crazy. I hope she doesn't inherit my messy disease. She's going to visit her father for two and half weeks on August 4th and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself while she's gone. When I told her that she said " Go out and party mom". She cracks me up.     &nbsp;   I'm always trying to lose weight. I really need to, but can't stay on track to save my life. I'm thinking about trying this French diet thing I read about in Marie Claire. It's not a diet, but a lifestyle change. But I'm lazy about cooking. It's so much easier to just stick a Lean Cuisine in the microwave.     &nbsp;   That's it for now. Yes I'm boring. Get over it.

						    I have a feeling that this blog is going to be like all diaries I had when&nbsp;I was a kid. I'd swear that I was going to write everyday and post my innermost thoughts and secrets and one day after I was dead someone would discover my diary and publish it. Then I'd write in it twice and forget all about it.  &nbsp;  So this is my first post. It's probably not going to get much more interesting from here, but whatever. You know you love me!

						    I know I'm depressed because I can't even stand to be on  urlLink Fametracker  right now. Everything over there is making me angry.      I keep going back and forth. One minute I feel like crying, the next minute I want to break something. But I mainly feel sad. Maybe I'm PMSing.       I've only been really depressed twice in my life. The first time was when I was a senior in high school and my sister attempted suicide on two occasions. I just didn't know how to deal with it and at the time I wasn't close to my sister or my mother. So I started sleeping a lot, not eating much, and developed an ulcer.      The second time was when I was in Chicago. Long story short I ended up in a nasty custody battle with my ex mother-in-law and her new husband over my daughter. They had no standing for custody at all and didn't make any kind of accusations about me as a mother at all, so I won the case.      Their whole basis for filing was they were concerned that I'm not Christian, don't go to church and wasn't sending my daughter to a Christian school. I'm serious. They thought they could win on that basis alone. It was thrown out of court, but not until I'd spent thousands, that's right thousands of dollars, on attorney's fee and lost a lot of sleep. My mother told me later that whenever she talked to me I sounded like I was dead. And in some ways I think I was. The whole thing came out of nowhere and was quite a shock. Until I was served the papers, I had had a good relationship with those people.      Now I hope they die in a slow painful death and the hands of a madman.

						    I did something last night that I haven’t done in a long time.  I made myself throw up.  I never had a problem with my weight until after I had my daughter. Like many girls do, I thought I was fat in high school, even though I wasn’t. I compared myself to other thinner girls and felt fat. But I didn’t starve myself or make myself throw up or even really exercise that much. A few years ago I was looking for something in my mother’s closet and came across some pictures of me from high school. I was a babe. I can’t believe I felt fat and ugly for so many years, because I was a hot little thing. I wish I had known it back then; it would’ve helped make high school slightly less hellish.  After high school I moved to Florida and started waitressing. Being on my feet for many hours a day combined with a pack a day smoking habit, I lost a lot of weight. I looked good. Well good by today’s standards anyways.  But after I had my daughter I was unable to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight. There were many factors that contributed to this. I had stopped waitressing and was working in customer service, so instead of running around a lot I was sitting at a desk for 8 hours straight. I had also gained a lot of weight during my pregnancy because I had to go on bed rest during my last trimester and to be honest I didn’t watch what I ate at all. I’d never had a problem with my weight, so I assumed I could lose it quickly like my mother did. I also went back to my old eating habits not realizing my metabolism had slowed considerably.  After I realized the weight wasn’t going to come off I tried the Atkins diet. It worked but I had a problem sticking to it after the first few weeks. I love carbs and craved then constantly. That started the last six years of yo-yo dieting.  I got married and had a baby way too young. Predictably the marriage didn’t last. After my husband and I separated I moved back home to San Diego. I was unprepared at such a young age to take care of an infant by myself, and that coupled with being very poor and receiving very little financial support, cause me to start starving myself during the day, then binging on one meal at night and throwing it up. I also exercised several days a week and was soon back to my pre-pregnancy weight. I slowly started eating again and gained some weight back, but was still proud of the way I looked.  Then I lost my job. I had just moved from a one bedroom apartment into a two bedroom one and the company I was working for decided to downsize and I was laid off. I applied for unemployment but didn’t qualify because you have to have earned so much money during the last three quarters of the previous year or something like that. Because I had to quit working my last trimester and the fact that I didn’t go back to work until several months after my daughter was born, I hadn’t earned enough money to qualify for unemployment. I was desperately trying to find another job, but was having no luck.  During this time I had started seeing my old high school boyfriend again. He was my first love and we had broken up when I moved to Florida then reconnected when I moved back to San Diego. I couldn’t even pay my rent so he offered to let my daughter and I move in with him. I didn’t want to have to rely on him to support us, but I really felt like I didn’t have any other choice. After we moved in with him, I started making myself throw up on a regular basis. My boyfriend knew about it, I didn’t try to hide it, but thought I was just doing it for attention. He may have been right, but I just felt so out of control of my life again. Luckily I found a job within a reasonable amount of time and stopped with the purging.  Then I stared trying to do Atkins again, but I’d be good for a few days and then cheat again. I would lose weight, then gain it, then lose it, etc. I also moved out of the house I was living in with my boyfriend and got my own place. My boyfriend was Arabic and his family hated me because I was American. His sister and brothers were often at the house and it created a stressful atmosphere I couldn’t deal with.  For awhile things were ok with me, but then I decided to go to a technical college and move to Chicago when I graduated. I decided to move to Chicago because that’s where my ex husband had moved and I thought it would be good for my daughter to be in the same state as both her parents. While I was in school I was also working full time and barely had time for anything else so I gained a lot of weight. After I finished my classes I was working part time, doing an internship and preparing to move to Chicago. I really didn’t want to go, I didn’t know anyone there, but I was trying to do what was best for my daughter. So once again I stared starving myself during the day and making myself throw up at night. I was also going to the gym almost everyday.  When I moved to Chicago I was so stressed out the entire time there that I continued the cycle of not eating, then gaining weight, then not eating, etc. A lot of bad stuff happened while I lived there that I’m not ready to write about yet, but made me realize it would be best for my daughter and I to move back home. By then my weight had stabilized and I thought I was doing ok.  My ex husband and I had never divorced, but after I left Chicago we started proceedings. It got nasty. I’m not going to get into a lot of details right now, but my ex had become a heroin addict and I had to sneak out of the state for my daughter’s safety. I was really worried that the Illinois court was going to order me to bring my daughter back to Chicago until the whole thing was over. I had already found a job making more money than I ever have before and an apartment I could actually afford in San Diego’s very expensive housing market. So I started eating a lot to deal with the stress and put on a lot of weight again.  This time I wanted to lose the weight the right way. No fad diets, no throwing up, no starving myself, just good food and exercise. I’m still trying to get into a routine, but I’ve been pretty good the last week or so. However my stress level is very high because despite attempts to keep my ex from seeing my daughter until he’s treated for his drug problem (he overdose on heroin a few months ago and can’t use his right arm) he’s been allowed to go meet her in Florida for visitation with his mother and step-father (who hate me with a passion, but that’s another story) for two and a half weeks. I’ve been trying to get through the time she’s gone, but it’s been hard and all came to a head last night.  I’m not sure what made last night the night I let the stress get to me. I went to the gym and had a really good workout. I was feeling great on my way home and then suddenly I was turning into Jack in the Box and ordering a chicken sandwich and french fries. Even after I got home and ate I just told myself I would be good the rest of the week, maybe have an extra workout to make up for the meal and life would go on. But I couldn’t get my mind off the food that I’d consumed. A little thought wiggled into my mind but I tried to ignore it. But it was driving me crazy that I’d been so good and had ruined it with one meal. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore and I made myself throw up. Not pretty I know and not something I want to start again.  So now I’m trying to keep myself sane, that it was an isolated incident, that I can control this. I hope it was a one time thing and that my daughter will come back, the stress will disappear and I will continue to struggle healthily with my weight.

						    Here’s an update to all the changes I’ve been planning in my life.  1)       Becoming a vegetarian. That kick lasted about one day. I never got the kit I ordered from Peta, so they obviously don’t want me to join them. Plus when I told my mother I was going to stop eating meat she bought me a bag of chicken breasts. She’s worried I can’t afford food and won’t ask her for money for groceries. Christ, I’m not that poor. Ok I am, but moving on.  2)       Becoming fabulous. Let’s just say I bought 3 pairs of pants and 3 shirts at Wal-Mart yesterday.  3)       Becoming a gold digger. It was partially a joke, but Wal-Mart clothes don’t seem to attract men who drive Mercedes.  So I’m pretty much where I was when I started this thing. I swear I’m not so pathetic in person, I’m really not. I just need to brush up on my creative writing skills.

						    So my new Fametracker girl crush is baggylettuce. I’ve actually crushed on her for awhile now. She funny, smart, articulate, British, and although I’ve never met her, I’m convinced she has a fantastic rack.  I have a fantasy that I moved to England and we get a flat in London, and have wonderful misadventures. Sometimes we go to swanky nightclubs and men send champagne to our tables and come over and kiss our hands and tell us how beautiful we are until we get bored and leave. They will follow, begging us to spend the weekend in France with them, asking for our hands in marriage, but we refuse to be tied down. The next day flowers and diamonds will arrive at our house and we will laugh and put them away for a rainy day.  Other times we will go to trendy night clubs, drink vodka martinis and dance all night. We will meet fabulous people, and immediately forget their names. Then, tired from all the dancing and smoozing, we get chips at some hole in the wall. On the way home baggy will trip and spill her fries, but I will share mine with her because I’m such a wonderful friend.  Sometimes we’ll go to one of the local pubs and drink Guinness until we are shitfaced and sing Irish fight songs with the boys in the pub. Then we’ll get lost on the way home and forget where we live, so we’ll sleep in the park with a bunch of transvestite hookers. It would be fabulous, I just know it.

						    I’m really fucking bored right now. I’m at work and I have nothing to do. Absolutely nothing. And my boss knows it. He knows I’ve been wandering around online for quite awhile now. People at Fametracker and The Off-Topic Fametracker Forums need to start posting faster, cuz I is one bored bitch right now. I keep obsessively going back to those sites hoping for just one little post in one of the threads I actually read. But no. It’s all about Tom Cruise and Matthew Broderick and people I don’t care about. I need more pics of Britney looking like she’s homeless and Jennifer Lopez needs to get married again. Or at least have a very major public breakdown. I really need to find some more websites.  *SIGH* I’m going to go back to being bored now.

						    1)       Have an orgy with Michael Rosenbaum, Joaquin Phoenix, and John Mayer (shut up!) 2)       Slap Paris Hilton, Mischa Barton, or Gwyneth Paltrow. Preferably all 3. I’d put J-Lo on that list but I’m worried I would never be able to get the body bling off my hand. 3)       Make out with Baby Spice circa 1997. 4)       Travel all over Europe (I’ve got to have some normal wishes) 5)       See the Pyramids in Egypt 6)       Have an orgy with Michael Rosenbaum, Joaquin Phoenix, and John Mayer (can you tell I really want this?) 7)       Fall truly, madly, deeply, in love 8)       See my daughter graduate from college 9)       Be able to afford to buy a house in San Diego 10)   Have an orgy with Michael Rosenbaum, Joaquin Phoenix, and John Mayer (pretty please with sugar on top)

						    I just found out that at least one person reads this thing. So now I have to always be funny and entertaining and tell fabulous stories. Just in case they come back. Of course if they read the crap I already posted, I doubt that’ll happen.  Ok, I’m gonna tell the funniest thing that happened last Friday when I went out.  I went to a local bar called The Camel’s Breath Inn. My friend Sarah was there and a bunch of other people I know. I intended on having two drinks, some dinner and then going home. Of course I stayed there until 2am, got shit faced, and danced like maniac. Good times!  About 1am, I’m drunk, but still functional drunk. My friend Sarah is non-functional drunk, which isn’t uncommon for her. So she’s sitting there and says, actually slurs, to me that she has to pee really bad but can’t make it to the bathroom by herself. So being the good friend that I am I help her up, put her arm around my waist and help her to the bathroom. Where there are 10 people in line. She says she can’t wait so I help her back to the table.  Her husband is settling the tab so I figure she can wait until she gets home. She can’t. She tells me she has to go so bad she’s going to pee her pants. There are some restaurants near us, so I figure I’ll take her in there. But it’s 1am and everything is closed. So fuck it, I take her back behind the buildings to pee in the alley. There are some people making out, but we ignore them. I help her behind dumpster, but she has to lean back on it to stay upright. Of course the dumpster starts rolling backwards, so I have to stand on one side of it and lean against it to keep it from moving, while watching the ground to make sure I don’t get pee on my shoe.  Ok, reading what I wrote it’s actually not so funny, but fuck you, my life is boring. I promise after my daughter gets back, I’ll get much more interesting.

						    But barely. I know no one reads this, so it doesn't really matter that I haven't posted in several days. But I have nothing fun, cool, or interesting to post. I actually had a decent weekend. I went out on Friday and met some friends and got nicely drunk. I have a couple of stories, but lack the motivation right now to tell them in a funny way. Maybe after my daughter gets back.      It's been hard with her gone. I can't sleep. So then I'm a wreck at work and have trouble concentrating. Fuck this sucks!! I'm going to the gym after work today. I hope that helps. I've decided that I need to get serious about losing weight. It'll just get harder as I get older, so I need to nip it in the bud now. However I refuse to start smoking again to lose weight. I was good yesterday, but need to focus more on fresh foods rather than frozen diet producs for lunch and dinner.      I actually tried to go to Henry's to get some food. I left the directions at work, but had looked at them and figure I could figure out how to get there. Nope, got lost in Hillcrest. So I ended up at Vons. Oh well, maybe I'll ride my bike out there this weekend.      I'm out!!

						    My daughter left last night to go to Florida for two weeks. I'm really sad and miss her already. I don't want her to be there for long and complicated reasons I'm not in the mood to explain now. I'm going to have to keep myself busy. Nights are going to suck though. It's going to be hard to sleep. For once it sucks to be single, because then at least I'd have someone to comfort me.      Oh well, there's nothing I can do. Gotta suck it up and do this one day at a time.

						    I got fucked up on Saturday. At my parents house. Because of pot. Yep I smoked pot at my parents house. It was theirs.      I went over there for dinner. My parents were suppose to go see Dennis Miller, but my stepfather is in a wheelchair because he broke his leg and them a week later hurt his shoulder. My mom went with one of her friends, so I ended up staying there.      We were drinking and watching tv and when my mom got home out came the pot. I never smoke because it really really effects me. But I thought " What the hell". After two hits though, I was done. I was too fucked up to tell them I was fucked up, so I stumbled into the back bedroom and fell asleep.      I know this is a really boring version of the story and I could make it funny, but my daughter is leaving on Wednesday to go visit her father and I'm depressed. I'll explain more about that later.
