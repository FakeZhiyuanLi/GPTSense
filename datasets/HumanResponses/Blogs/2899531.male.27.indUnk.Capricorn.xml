      My friend Fred sent me this link:  urlLink Click here .  It snowed last night, and today there were plenty of closings and delays.  I guess hackers hacked into Carolina Newschannel 14's system last night and typed in their own closings and delays.  Check it out.  It's so funny.  My favorites are:  "B. Lo Mi Dry Cleaning Inc.  Closed Friday until 12. Pick up at noon. Johnathon (sic) Holmes or Baua Lo Mi for more."  and "Bring Em Young.  Closed Friday.  Contact R. Kelly for more details."

      No work today meant record shopping!  Another difficult time sorting through what to buy and what to pass on.  Passed on at the last minute (so sad):  Arthur Russell - World of Arthur Russell (Soul Jazz) - I will buy this next time, dammit; Dizzee Rascal's new album (used); Trojan's Upsetters Singles Box Set; Stark Reality - Now (Stone's Throw); and V/A - Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos (Afrostrut).  Bought: Amps for Christ - The People at Large (5RC) - my favorite album of the year thus far; V/A - Wooden Guitar (Locust Music); Oneida - Secret Wars (JagJaguwar); Kanye West - The College Dropout (finally my very own copy!); and  urlLink New Hope for the Ape-Eared: The Best of Scharpling & Wurster on the Best Show on WFMU Vol. 2  - SO FUCKING FUNNY!

      Jason Perlmutter,  urlLink WXYC  DJ and station manager has what may be the world's largest collection of soul and funk music from North Carolina, 99% extremely obscure.  I believe he has over a thousand soul and funk 45's in all, and many of those are North Carolina singles.  Anyway, he's doing tonight's  urlLink Thursday Night Feature  on North Carolina funk and soul, all from his personal collection.  I'm listening right now, and it's great.  If you're reading this and it is between 9pm and midnight Eastern Time, I strongly recommend that you tune into 89.3 FM if you're in the Triangle or click on the links above to listen over the internet.  By the way, my next show is Wednesday night (3-3) from 7pm to 9pm.  Eat a dick.

      Me: "What should you do if a boy or girl much smaller than yourself starts to fight with you?"  [I'm expecting an answer something like, "Don't fight back," or "Ignore him," or "Tell an adult."]  7-year-old boy with ADHD: "Jump over him and punch him in the back!"  Awesome.  That has been the highlight of today, my hangover-filled day.

      I am:  A Nightmare Before Christmas.  "You are easily bored with what you live with, and want more adventure, something completely different. Sometimes, when you can't find it, you lock yourself up and do very morbid things (writing, singing, listening, etc.) When you do find adventure and take it the wrong way too quickly without listening to the advice of others, you soon find that your good old life wasn't really that terrible after all."  The first two sentences are sorta accurate.  The last sentence isn't.  I'm not sure what that description has to do with A Nightmare Before Christmas, though.  Haven't seen the movie.   urlLink What Tim Burton movie are you?

      I'm a huge Billy Murray fan, and when Lost in Translation came out in the theaters last year, I knew I had to see it.  Little did I know that it would turn out to be arguably my personal favorite movie...perhaps ever.  Its story of a new friendship and deep romantic connection mixed with a sexual tension that shouldn't and isn't crossed along with disillusionment with one's life is something I can understand completely, and I wish I wrote the script.  I'm simultaneously envious of Sofia Coppola and a great admirer of hers.  I get the same feelings watching this movie as I do listening to Cat Power.  Okay, enough of this touchy-feely shit.  The reason I bring up Lost in Translation is that I just saw it again on DVD, which my sister bought for me for my birthday last month.  Kevin Shields (of My Bloody Valentine fame) contributes four new songs and his first real material since the days of MBV.  Also on the soundtrack is MBV's "Sometimes" from Loveless.  So this past week I've been getting back into My Bloody Valentine, listening to Loveless nonstop in my car to and from work all week, including today.  As I listened today to the whole thing, I started thinking of perfect albums, albums that have absolutely no weak tracks or songs I (almost) always skip over when listening to them, are in perfect order, and starting from the first track, I don't want to stop until the album is done.  In that sense, Loveless is perfect.  I started thinking of other "perfect" albums, not including "Best of's", compilations, and live albums.  And I had a lot of trouble thinking of them...which was surprising because I could name hundreds of albums at the top of my head that I absolutely love, but most have one or more songs I almost always skip over.  (Another thing, I believe you *cannot* or *should not* use the same criteria for different genres of music.  For example, in my opinion you can't use the same criteria to judge a hip hop album that you do for a rock album.  That's why I think that a person who's exclusively into rock music or whatever has a difficult time appreciating the absolute brilliance of someone like Jay-Z, and conversely, someone who's exclusively into hip hop may have a difficult time appreciating the beautiful noise of Wolf Eyes.  But all this is another story.)  Anyway, here's a short and incomplete list of "perfect" albums to me:  obviously Loveless, the first two Velvet Underground records, Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Dr. Dr√©'s The Chronic, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Gilberto Gil's 1969 self-titled album, Gang Starr's Daily Operation, John Coltrane's Giant Steps, Beefheart's Lick My Decals Off, Baby, numerous Bob Dylan albums, Can's Tago Mago, PiL's Second Album/Metal Box, Nas' Illmatic, and many more...I'm getting tired of thinking about this shit.  There are albums that I don't consider "perfect" that I probably enjoy listening to as much as, if not more than some of those listed above...but if not for those songs I don't care for...  Okay, I promise I won't write about music next time, unless it's putting up a playlist from my radio show.

      Jesus fucking Christ.  Okay, I've finally done it.  Never say never...because I kinda swore I'd never have my own weblog.  But after seeing my friend  urlLink Tom's blog , my friend  urlLink Todd's blog , my friend  urlLink Fred's blog , and other blogs that mostly talk about music, politics, and shit, I got inspired and said "fuck it" and decided to develop my own meaningless blog.  I really don't know exactly what kinds of things I'm going to write on this, or how often I'll update it.  Todd and Fred write about different things, but one thing that they do that I'll probably start doing is listing their playlists from their  urlLink radio shows .  Mine was last night, and I can't remember everything that I played off the top of my head, but it was a decent show...I give it a B.  But I'll start posting playlists from my next show on...and maybe from last night, too, if I decide to make it over to WXYC and write down what I played.  I'm lazy, so I probably won't.  In any case, I'll probably write about all sorts of random things because my mind's usually all over the place, although often they gravitate towards the areas of music, women, and beer.  I probably won't get too personal, so it won't be like you're reading my fucking diary or anything, which I've never really understood anyway (diaries, that is).

      I drove out to Greensboro (a little bit over an hour west of here) last night to see  urlLink Mahjongg .  They're touring right now with Pretty Girls Make Graves (and the Constantines for a little bit).  I still don't understand how they ended up playing Greensboro (and tonight in fucking Greenville, NC), and not Chapel Hill (or even Raleigh).  The show last night had a really young crowd, and I felt like a perverted old man because I noticed that a lot of those high school(?) girls were pretty damn hot.  I just stayed for Mahjongg, who put on a very good show.  It was the first time I'd ever seen them, since they formed after I left Columbia four years ago.  Their sound has changed a lot from their recording on the  urlLink KCOU  comp, moving from a post-rock sound to a more new wave, post-punk sound.  I have their nice new EP (Machinegong) on mp3, but I want it on vinyl, which they ran out of.  I also noticed how much better they sound live...and on their last song, there were definite Afro-beat influences, something that isn't really evident on their EP despite what it says on their one-sheet.  More than anything, I'm proud of my Columbia, Missouri (now Chicago + Columbia + Portland) boyz (& girl).  They're already good, and I expect them to get better and better.  Live, I think they're kind of reminiscent of Need New Body (who actually put on a not-so-good show when I saw them a few weeks ago).  Now that I'll be moving to Chicago this summer, I'm sure I'll get to witness their evolution more closely.

      Like 5 billion other people on this planet, I fucking hate Mondays...and Sundays to a certain extent.  Work went by so slowly today, and the internet got old really fast, even though I did not want to resume my neverending work.  Fuck Mondays.  Too much drinking and not enough sleep this weekend and too much work today equal a big fat cock.  (The converse of that holds true, too.)  What makes Mondays especially excruciating is that my office is next to the police officer's, and he always has his radio tuned into the Clear Channel adult contemporary station.  So I have to sit through hours of white adult contemporary soft rock like that Bryan Adams song from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, "Kokomo" by the Beach Boys, "Forever Young" by Rod Stewart (I actually liked this song when it came out when I was in the 5th grade, but it fucking came on twice in two hours!), that faggy Clay Aiken song, and others.  Sometimes they'll play "Material Girl" by Madonna, which makes it a little more tolerable, but listening to that shit along with it being Monday, I just want to play Russian Roulette with all the chambers loaded.  So I'm a fucking drama queen.  Piss off.  I'm now home and I don't have time to relax.  In between the hangovers and drinking this past weekend, I didn't get a chance to review music for the station.  So I will now review as much as I can before the New Music Show tonight.  Then, I'll try to go to sleep afterwards, but hopefully I'll catch Futurama before I fall asleep.  Speaking of Futurama, I still want to know why Fox canceled this show.  It was fucking brilliant.  It's so much better than the Simpsons.  If anything, they should've canceled the Simpsons years ago.  For some reason, I still manage to not miss any Simpsons episodes, but it hasn't made me laugh out loud in years...unless it's a rerun from around the years '93 to '98 or so.  This show just hasn't been very good for about half a decade.  I think I read somewhere that Matt Groening and Adult Swim are talking about developing a new Adult Swim cartoon.  I hope this is true, and I hope it turns out to be funny like Futurama and not fucking retarded like the Simpsons has been.

      I just read recently in some magazine that everytime you flush the toilet, there's microscopic fecal bacteria that can fly as high as twenty feet in the air.  So the article recommended that you rinse your tootbrush in Listerine or some potent mouthwash before brushing your teeth.  It also recommended that you close the lid on your toilet when you flush.  I think this is kind of a pain in the ass, and I don't know if I want to go through all that trouble.  I'll probably forget anyway.  Besides, it's kind of fitting that we all get some shit in our mouths...especially me, considering the kind of language I typically use.

      It's almost official.  I will be moving back to the Midwest sometime in June.  And I will make it official when I call to accept the job offer on Monday.  After thinking New York City would be the city I'd end up in for much of my adult life, Chicago never entered into the equation until the past couple of years, and not seriously until the past year.  I've come to absolutely love Chicago and especially how affordable it is.  Having now lived in North Carolina for a total of nine and a half years, the Tar Heel state is as part of me as Missouri is, and I know I will miss it here, but it's time for this country boy to move on to the big city.  We'll see how long I can take the cold.

And it's 65 degrees outside...which is almost perfect.  I want to go to the OCSC patio (or even He's Not Here) and get drunk...anywhere outside.  But, alas, I have a radio show to do at six tonight.

      Last Wednesday I went to Duke for their annual free end-of-school year concert, which is on their campus in which thousands of Duke students get drunk on their wet campus in celebration of their last day of the semester.  This year was Kanye West and Dilated Peoples.  But DP never showed up.  The sound sucked for Kanye West, but it was still a fun show.  It was weird feeling buying and drinking beer on a college campus.  Members of Carolina's basketball team were there as were members of Duke's.  I saw Damion Grant, Rashad McCants, Jackie Manuel, and Melvin Scott for UNC.  I saw Shavlik Randolph, Daniel Ewing, and Sean Dockery for Duke.  Everyone except Randolph wore some sort of basketball throwback jersey.  It was weird seeing Rashad and Randolph embracing and acting as if they were friends.  Before Kanye went on, somebody near the stage held up a McCants #32 Carolina jersey.  There were more cheers than boos, which was odd considering we were on the Duke campus...probably because there were many North Carolina Central students, who I presume prefer Carolina over Duke.  I did hear a "Fuck Carolina" behind me, though.  Friday was the Six Organs of Admittance show at Nightlight, which I enjoyed very much.  Before Ben Chasney amazed me and everyone else with his guitar playing was this local old time band.  After Six Organs was local sludge metal band, Face Down in Shit, who I'd never even heard of before...but their ferocity and headbanging made an impression on me for the 15 or so minutes I stayed.  I just couldn't take the heat and the stench of metalhead body odor.  Plus, I was a little too high for my comfort.  It was a good (or bad depending on how you look at it) reminder for me to not get high when there are a lot of people around...since I get very self-conscious then very paranoid.  Perlmutter and Coach D kinda freaked me out, but I swear they had to have been fucking with me.  Bastards.  WXYC played WXDU in our annual kickball bragging rights game.  I think XDU had a three game winning streak or something like that before last year, when we crushed those bastards.  This year we had approximately 30 DJs or so show up in comparison to their 15 or so.  So our talent was diluted, and also since they invited some of their sports show nerds to play.  They got off to an early lead, although there were some questions on how many runs they scored early on.  We made a furious comback late (helped by a 2-run RBI double from yours truly), but we ended up losing 7-6.  Basically, they just cheated better than we did.  They must have learned from Coach K...they know how to work the refs to their advantage, i.e., cheat.

      I got a call from CD Alley last week while I was in Chicago telling me that the  Goodbye, Babylon  boxset I had them order had arrived.  Today I picked it up, and I'm listening to it right now.  For those not familiar, this boxset (made by the new and fabulous 78 reissue record label,  urlLink Dust-to-Digital ) features five discs of old time gospel music (both black and white) from the years 1902 to 1960 and one disc featuring 25 sermons from the years 1926 to 1941.  Yes, it's even better than it sounds.  The packaging is hand-made, and it's beautiful.  It comes in a wooden box, and when you open the box, you'll notice that there's cotton lined up inside.  A 200+ page book is also included.  There are 135 songs from the obscure to some more recognizable names such as Hank Williams, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Bill Monroe, to name a few.  It's well worth its $100 pricetag ($89.95 at CD Alley).  Christ be with you, bitch!

      There are some good shows that will be coming to the area in my last couple of months here in North Carolina.  I should probably attend these shows instead of skipping so many as I have in the past, some regrettably.  This week itself will be hectic.  Wednesday night at  urlLink Go!  is Four Tet.  I think I might have free tickets to see Nas at the Dean Dome on Thursday, but I need to follow up on that.  Friday is Six Organs of Admittance at  urlLink Nightlight  followed by KRS-One at the  urlLink Cradle , which I have a free ticket to.  I might attend the Tortoise show (with Beans opening) at the Cradle next Sunday, but it's $14/16.  If it's Beans (from Antipop Consortium) and not the post rock band Beans from Vancouver, then I might be more inclined to go.  Other shows I'll probably attend include: Patton Osawlt (from King of Queens), Brian Posehn (from Mr. Show), and Jon Wurster (from Superchunk) on 4-30 at the Cradle (a little standup comedy); the USA is a Monster at Nightlight on 5-3; Ex-Girl at Go! on 5-18; Need New Body and Hella at Go! on 5-30; Acid Mothers Temple at Go! on 6-16 (if I'm still here).  There are others I might attend, but these caught my eye at first glance.

      Knowing the criteria and characteristics for Bipolar Disorder from my training and education as a psychologist, I know I'm not a manic depressive.  But, damn, I can have some fast mood swings.  I was pretty angry and bummed out most of yesterday from my experience looking for an apartment here in Chicago this week.  Some of that anger is still there, but there's basically no point in staying mad.  First, my new apartment is cool.  Second, the rent is very reasonable.  And third, as I looked at the map of Chicago and where I'll be living, and having my friend Paul drive me around for a bit, I noticed that my apartment's location within the heart of Ukrainian Village is a very good one.  I'll be a block away from the  urlLink Empty Bottle .  It'll also be a short walk to many cool bars, restaurants, record stores, etc.  And apparently, I can walk to some friends' apartments easily.  Also, I'll be a few blocks away from a hospital...so if I ever get stabbed or shot, I can run over to the hospital in no time.  But my neighborhood and surrounding area seem pretty safe, so I don't expect to get assaulted.  Besides, with the sawed-off shot gun I carry with me at all times, no one's going to fuck with me.  The process of finding this apartment fucking blew.  But I think the end result looks pretty good.

Let's just say that this apartment hunting experience has been one of the most frustrating and stressful experiences I've ever had that has had nothing to do with grad school.  I want to say "Fuck Chicago," but it's not really Chicago's fault.  Having lived in college towns (Columbia, MO and Chapel Hill/Carrboro, NC) for the past ~9 years or so, my experience in finding apartments has been different.  I'm used to finding a place to live 3-4 months in advance, but I guess in Chicago (and large cities), most available places are looking for people to move in immediately or in a month at the latest.  But since this is the only time I can make it up here to look at places before I actually move, I wanted to secure a place before I had to go back to Carrboro.  To make a long and boring story short, a couple of hours ago, I signed a lease to this pretty decent apartment in Ukrainian Village.  I'll be living with my old Columbia chum, Mr. Jeff Carrillo, guitarist for up and coming world beaters,  urlLink Mahjongg .  The catch is, the lease starts May 15, which puts a financial strain on both me and Jeff.  My job ends in early June, and my current Carrboro lease ends June 30th.  I was planning on moving to Chicago on June 29th or 30th or July 1st because I wanted to spend a few weeks in North Carolina partying and impregnating women, but I guess I'll probably now be moving up to Chicago sometime in early to mid June.  Anyway, the apartment itself is pretty cool, and it's affordable for such a big city.  It's on the third floor (top floor) of this building, and from our windows, you can see parts of the Chicago skyline.  I figure once I get settled in and used to living in the city (I'm guessing by mid-July-ish), my anger at this experience will have faded.  So I'm going to go get fucked up tonight and then drive back to St. Louis tomorrow.  Then the next day I'll drive back to North Carolina.  I fucking hate my life.

      I'm back home in good ol' St. Louis, the Gateway City, home of the Cardinals, Blues, Rams, Imo's Pizza, toasted ravioli, Chuck Berry, Nelly, and the bowling hall of fame.  I made it in my usual ~13 hour trip from Chapel Hill.  It was one of the smoother roadtrips because I didn't run into too much traffic, even though I almost got rear-ended by two cars during a sudden stop in St. Louis due to a car accident by the Galleria.  Notes from the road:  North Carolina:  What a beautiful state.  I dare to call it the most beautiful state not on the west coast.  West of Winston-Salem, I saw a really tall flagpole by I-40 with an American flag and a Confederate flag right below it.  Sometimes I forget that I live in the South since Chapel Hill and most of the Triangle doesn't really feel like the South.  I made to Asheville in a little over 3 hours, which is a new record (it usually takes about 4 hours).  I love Asheville.  It's probably the only other place in North Carolina I'd consider living in.  Tennessee:  Also a pretty state to drive through, mostly.  But it's rednecks and Christian-right galore.  Lots of large cities (and medium-size cities) are ugly to drive through, but Knoxville takes the cake.  What a fucking dump.  It's like the world's largest truckstop.  I have lots of mix cds to listen to, and they really helped me tolerate this drive.  And mix cds are the best on roadtrips, although I have to say that the Fucking Champs' IV is an awesome roadtrip album.  I rocked out to it while driving through Nashville.  Kentucky:  Not much going on in this state.  Their car license plates are the pussiest license plates I've ever seen.  It's a picture of a sunrise, and the sun has a fucking smiley face drawn on it.  Jesus, even the queer eye for the straight guy dudes would call that gay.  I listened to a lot of Black Dice and Wolf Eyes through Kentucky, which surprisingly makes for good and soothing roadtrip music when you're by yourself.  As I was about to leave Kentucky for Illinois, I noticed that the miles tracker below the speedometer read 666.  I wonder what if that means anything...  Illinois:  What a shitty state.  The southern tip of Illinois isn't too bad, but when people think of the stereotypical midwest with just flat land and nothing worthwhile to see, I don't understand why Illinois isn't typically included with the likes of Indiana, Kansas, Iowa, etc.  (Leave Missouri out of it...it ain't the best, but it's a hell of a lot better than those states.)  The drive from St. Louis to Chicago doesn't take too long, but it sucks due to how shitty Illinois is.  Fuck that state.  The only two redeeming things I can think of Illinois are Chicago and East St. Louis, the strip club capital of the midwest.  It was a little creepy at times driving through Illinois, due to the rain, and because of the lack of traffic, very little light anywhere.  Plus I was listening to the Swans' Children of God album.  Missouri:  I love rolling into St. Louis from the Illinois side.  First, it's because I'm leaving that dreaded state.  But it's also because I love seeing the St. Louis skyline coming in from the east.  St. Louis doesn't have the most impressive skyline, but the Arch definitely makes it look nice.  I never tire of seeing the city coming in from the east.  As I crossed the Mississippi, I knew I had to come back home gangsta style.  So I switched from the Swans album to Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001.  Word.  Now I'm back home and am relaxed.  I wish I could spend more time here and hang out, but tomorrow I'm heading out to the Windy City to look at apartments.

      I thought I was good this weekend when I decided not to attend the record fair here in Carrboro.  I decided I didn't need to be spending any more money like P Diddy.  But today, I said, "Fuck it," and went to CD Alley and spent what little money I have on some records and CDs...and right now, I'm glad I did.  CDs bought:  Iron and Wine - Our Endless Numbered Days  (Sub Pop) and  Various Artists - Hits and Misses: Muhammad Ali and the Ultimate Sound of Fistfighting  (Trikont) - a compilation of music about Muhammad Ali or stuff performed by him, Joe Frazier, George Foreman and others...I haven't really listened to this yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  Records bought:  the new  Noxagt - The Iron Point  (Load) - I'm listening to this right now, and it's awesome; the  Mot√∂rhead - England  boxset (Earmark) - this has three LPs: Overkill in green vinyl, Bomber in blue vinyl, and Ace of Spades in gold-colored vinyl; the new  Black Dice - Miles of Smiles  EP (DFA);  The USA is a Monster - Tasheyana Compost  (Load) - I already have this on CDR, but this record comes in hand-made screenprinted package; and a little Philly soul:  The Delfonics  self-titled album (Philly Groove).  Passed on: too many to name.  Didn't have but really want: the new Fennesz  Still waiting to arrive: The Goodbye Babylon boxset  I think it's time to go back on the Ramen diet.  Fuck Atkins.

      Today, April 4th, is significant for a few reasons.  First, it's my sister's 25th birthday.  So that means she can legally drink now.  Second, it's the date of Martin Luther King's assassination.  So that means that my sister was born on the day he died, and I was born on his birthday, which is January 15th.  I take that as to mean that my sister and I are honorary members of the the African-American community.  I've always liked the fact that MLK and I share the same birthday.  But today is a special day here in Carrboro, North Carolina.  For those of you who don't know, Carrboro is kind of like the lesser-known and more liberal sister town to Chapel Hill.  The University of North Carolina is basically at the Chapel Hill-Carrboro border.  Chapel Hill has a reputation for being liberal, but I think it's largely in part due to Carrboro.  And today was designated "Dennis Kucinich Day" by the mayor of Carrboro.  And the guest of honor was...you guessed it, Congressman Dennis Kucinich!  I'm not sure how everyone feels about him, but he, to me, is the IDEAL person for this country, whether it be as president or any other leadership position acting on behalf of the good of this country.  Even though I have doubts on whether he can be an effective president because there would be so much opposition from the powerful (Republicans, rich Democrats, corporations, the national media, and people just afraid of change), I still support him wholly on his quest to make some changes in both the Democratic party and the lawmakers in Congress.  He still beats the hell out of Bush, John Kerry, John Edwards, and others.  Today also makes me appreciate even more the town I live in.  Carrboro (and Chapel Hill) is a special and very progressive place, and I realize what I'm giving up by moving to Chicago at the end of June.  The people here are how the rest of this country should be like...hell, the rest of fucking conservative North Carolina.  You may remember that the Daily Show with Jon Stewart came here last year to do a piece on Carrboro's "French Appreciation Month," in response to all those anti-French sentiments because of the war in Iraq.  (The term "freedom fries" originated from somewhere in this state.)  I fucking love this town.  I can easily see myself moving back here when I want to settle down...or if I find that Chicago's not a place I want to live in after all.

      That Three Times One Minus One song (from Mr. Show) is stuck in my head...specifically the part where Bob Odenkirk's character says, "Damn!"  And I can't think of a better part of any song to be stuck in my head right now.  Today, after work, I bought a spindle of blank CDRs and the She's All That DVD for $10.  And I just treated myself right to a pound of filet mignon.  Damn!

      Just got back from the  urlLink Need New Body  show at  urlLink Go! , and it was a better show than when I saw them last a couple of months ago at  urlLink Kings .  I missed the opening band, Make Believe, a band I heard is from Chicago.  Cy Rawls told me they were good.  Anyway, it's always a jolt to my senses when I go to a show and most of the crowd looks very young.  I wasn't annoyed until early in the Need New Body set, when the singer invited this kid, who couldn't have been older than 16 or 17, on stage and let him dance.  It obviously went to his head because for the rest of the show, he would dance spastically and arrhythmically in front of the stage, especially during slow songs you can't dance to...and including breaks between songs.  Every so often, he would peek back to see if people were watching him.  I felt like slapping him upside the head and telling him that nobody gives a shit about him - that they came here to see the band, not some teenage hotshot-wannabe.  It was also so fucking hot in there I decided not to stay for Hella.  God, I hate stupid teenagers.

      As I was wasting time just now listening to MPEG stream samples from  urlLink Aquarius Records  and simultaneously surfing the web, I came across this blog,  urlLink Flirting with Sophia , and its latest entry intrigued me.  So I decided to copy it and post it on my blog.  (I'm citing where I got it from, so it's not plagiarism!)  I guess the information comes from last week's Economist, but basically it reaffirms what I have long suspected - that Republicans in general are less intelligent that Democrats, or at least more liberal-than-Republican-types.  I don't necessarily like the Democratic party, but I'm definitely not a Republican.  I think the majority of them are idiots.  Here's the post:  "So Democrats really are smarter":  Presidential vote and states average I.Q: (national ranking, state, presidential choice in 2000, average I.Q)  1 - Connecticut (Gore - Democrat) 113 2 - Massachusets(Gore - Democrat) 111 3 - New Jersey (Gore - Democrat) 111 4 - New York (Gore - Democrat) 109 5 - Rhode Island (Gore - Democrat) 107 6 - Hawaii (Gore - Democrat) 106 7 - Maryland (Gore - Democrat) 105 8 - New Hampshire (Bush - Republican) 105 9 - Illinois (Gore - Democrat) 104 10 - Delaware (Gore - Democrat) 103  40 - Alabama (Bush - Republican) 92 41 - Louisiana (Bush - Republican) 91 42 - Montana (Bush - Republican) 90 43 - Oklahoma (Bush - Republican) 90 44 - South Dakota (Bush - Republican)89 45 - South Carolina (Bush - Republican) 87 46 - Wyoming (Bush - Republican) 87 47 - Idaho (Bush - Republican) 86 48 - Utah (Bush - Republican) 85 49 - Mississippi (Bush - Republican) 85  I'd be curious to see the whole list, but I don't want to pay the fee on economist.com.

      One of the three schools I work at is this high school whose population is about 75% black, 15% Hispanic, and 10% white.  I didn't notice this as much last year, but this past school year it's been impossible not to notice.  The majority of the black guys (and some white dudes) wear baggy, oversized white T-shirts every day, oftentimes ones that come down to their knees.  I think I might've seen on the news last fall that this is a "gang" style.  Although most of these guys most likely are not in gangs, anything "gangsta" is deemed cool.  Jay-Z had a baggy white T-shirt on in some of the pictures in his album, The Blueprint...but that was from 2001.  So I wondered if maybe the white T-shirt thing was hitting North Carolina 2-3 years late and that NYC was past this trend.  So I asked this 16-year-old recently transplanted freshman from Brooklyn what the deal was with these white T-shirts, because he wears one most days as well.  He said that it's just the style these days...especially when most people don't have much money to spend, they just spend a few bucks on white T-shirts.  But that reason doesn't make any sense to me since most of these kids also wear these really expensive throwback jerseys, and the white T-shirts that they wear don't look cheaply made, like a Hanes or Fruit of the Loom.  My guess is that these kids buy these shirts for at least $20 each from the same stores that carry the throwback jerseys.  I personally think they look stupid, especially when they come down to the knees.  It'd be cooler if they all had flat tops and dressed like Dwayne from A Different World.

      I had to go to Wilmington this weekend to take care of some business.  Here are some random notes and observations:  There were tons of people in Wilmington.  It's that time of the year when tourists come in flocks to the North Carolina coast.  I need to hit the beach before I move, but I'm not sure whether I want to go where there are tons of people like there were this weekend in Wilmington.  There's bound to be even more next weekend for the Memorial Day weekend.  If there were less rednecks (and white people in general) in Wilmington, it would be awesome.  Still, a nice town.  Market Street near the downtown area is beautiful with trees' limbs hanging right over the street, kind of like East Franklin Street here in Chapel Hill.  Commercial radio stations have such stupid nicknames, like "The Buzz" or "The Point" or whatever.  It's the same in every city.  Wilmington's classic rock station is called "The Bone."  Not only might this be the dumbest, but it's possibly the funniest.  It was weird how sunny and beautiful it was in Wilmington and in the Triangle area.  In between I drove through one of the worst sudden downpours and thunderstorms in quite some time.

      The new single from the most famous golden shower giver in the world, R. Kelly, "Happy People," is basically the sequel to his last big hit single, "Step in the Name of Love (Remix)."  When I first heard this, I thought it was yet another remix to "Step in the Name of Love."  I liked it so much that I had to buy the single so I can listen to it nonstop.  Goddamn, both songs are so fucking good...maybe even golden shower good.

      I dislike the word "cute" in describing women - I prefer to use beautiful or pretty or hot or fuckable or gorgeous, etc...  For some reason, I don't like when "cute" is used to describe someone attractive, unless it's a girl calling me cute.  So I rarely use it.  But last night at Go! I saw the cutest band ever,  urlLink ex-Girl .  They're an all-female art-punk-rock trio from Japan.  They have this schtick in which they say they're from the planet KeroKero via Tokyo, and they wear these homemade space-age costumes when they perform live.  And their show last night was a lot of fun mostly because of how cute they are.  The bass player (and leader, I suppose), Kirilola, is the cutest; she's beautiful and I decided I want to marry her.  I wonder if she's into Korean guys...

      I just saw the sickest movie I've ever seen,  urlLink Ichi the Killer .  Based on the cult manga comic by Yamamoto Hideo, the movie is about this mentally (retarded and) unstable young man whose alter ego is this vicious killer intent on killing all bullies.  I'll spare you a synopsis, but you can go to the website listed above, or go to allmovie.com, or IMDb, or just do a google search for real reviews and stuff.  I read one (positive) review that called director, Takashi Miike "a sick bastard," and I agree completely.  It's the most violent movie I've ever seen, and the violence against women was very difficult to watch.  Yet, the movie is actually psychologically deep, and it has a weird and open-ended finish...actually the whole movie is weird and open-ended.  It's also so ridiculous that I found much of the movie and the violence (except the rapes) hilarious.  I'm going to watch this again tomorrow before returning it.

      I went into this show thinking this was my last radio show at  urlLink WXYC , but I treated it as any other show that I've done, except I knew I wanted to play more local Chapel Hill bands and I wanted to play two bands my friends are in,  urlLink Billy Schuh and the Foundry  and  urlLink Mahjongg , both of which I played.  I didn't get to play as many Chapel Hill bands, but I did end my show fittingly with "Wrong" by the Archers of Loaf from their first 7" single.  (The only other local band I fit in was Cold Sides.)  After the show, I was a little bummed out...but, alas, Evan and Andrea walked in, and they said I could sub for them before I leave.  I'll gladly take them up on their offer.  Here's the playlist:  H = Heavy; M = Medium; L = Light; S = Single; R = Request    Rah Brahs - Arty of the Irst Art (M) Male Slut - Industrial Noise Blues (off the Tracks & Fields comp) Nels Cline Trio - Cropped (H) Biota/Mnemonists - (No title - Track #9)  Pearls Before Swine - From the Movie of the Same Name (H) Devendra Banhart - Insect Eyes Harvester - Beautiful Crystal  (H) Jason Forrest - Big Outrageous Sound Club The Raincoats - Shouting Out Loud Max Romeo - Valley of Jehosaphat Shuggie Otis - Aht Uh Mi Hed  (L) Sentinel - Ancient History   This Heat - The Fall of Saigon Sun City Girls - Space Prophet Dogon  (H) Gino Bordin et Son Orchestre Hawaien - Hawaii-Marche (from the comp, Steeling Round the World Hawaiian Style) Ballake Sissoko - Deli John Fahey - Desperate Man Blues (R) Destroyer - The Music Lovers  (M) Urban Myth & Steve Beresford - Passage Wolf Eyes - These Girls of Mine (S) Cold Sides - Insight Force MD's - Let Me Love You (H) Konk - Alien Jam  (R) Camera Obscura - Keep It Clean (L) Igloo - Frog   Billy Schuh & the Foundry - Buy/Sell/Trade Mahjongg - Aluminum (H) Mission of Burma - Wounded World  Leroy Sibbles - Express Yourself (from the Studio One Soul comp) (M) Keith Hudson - Flesh of My Skin Tino Dia Kimuezo - Kibela Kiame (from Soul of Angola comp) Whistlin' Alex Moore - Chock House Boogie  (H) Jimmy Martin - Hit Parade of Love Okros Ensemble - Cigany csingeralasok (Gypsy jumping dance from Transylvania) Slavic Soul Party! - Seva (H) Leandro Guerrero (with Conjunto Alamo) - La Ratita (from Accordion Conjunto Champs comp)  Iron and Wine - Each Coming Night Jeffrey Fredericks/(Un)holy Modal Rounders - Robbin' Banks Flamin' Groovies - Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu  (R) The Pretenders - Brass in Pocket Archers of Loaf - Wrong

      Aside from my first year here in Chapel Hill, in which I was pretty unhappy with things and missed Missouri with a passion, I've had very few urges to go visit Columbia (MO) since most of my friends there had moved on to bigger and better places.  This past weekend, even though I had a pretty good time here, was one of those few times that I really did wish I was back in Columbia.  Around this time every year, there are traditionally one to two free music festivals held at the University of Missouri, or Mizzou, as us Midwestern rednecks like to call it.  One is called "Springfest" and is sponsored by  urlLink KCOU , Mizzou's reputable college radio station, and the other is called the "Missouri Derby," sponsored by the university via the College Music Committee.  This year they combined Springfest and the Derby by having a Springfest stage and a Derby stage with each stage alternating with little to no breaks in music from 4:30 on.  And they had free food!  The two big names on the Derby stage were Common and Jurassic 5.  The Springfest stage featured  urlLink Mahjongg  and MISSION OF BURMA!  Not only did I want to catch this show at the place where I spent some of the greatest years of my life, it would've been a grand reunion of sorts.  I already knew there were a few friends from all over the country flying/driving to Columbia for the weekend, but I just found out that there were even more people from my days at KCOU in Columbia this weekend.  Goddammit, I don't know when something like this will happen again.  I wish I could turn back time and party with those folks again.

      As I pulled out of my parking spot and shifted into drive at the post office, I noticed in my rearview mirror that this white Camaro was pulling out, and my worst fear came true.  She fucking hit me.  Luckily, it was the parking lot and it was at a low speed.  There doesn't seem to be any structural damage to either car, albeit some light scratches on my bumper.  I didn't really know what to do besides yell many profanities inside my car.  I just got her name and home and work numbers, and I wrote down the license plate numbers.  Should I have called the police to get this on record?

      Last night my Detroit Red Wings were eliminated from the NHL playoffs.  Although they "only" won three Stanley Cups in the past ten years, they've arguably been the most dominant hockey team since the early 90s.  Partly due to the huge expansion of the NHL since the 90s that drastically watered down the talent, hockey's been difficult to watch (especially for those not familiar with the sport) because it's so defensive with reduced offensive flow.  But I've always followed the Wings.  (For those of you not into hockey, in my opinion, until this boring, defensive style of hockey took over, there was no sport that compared to NHL hockey.  It was by far the most exciting game to watch - more than NCAA basketball and the NBA playoffs.  Now, unless Detroit is playing, even I can't watch it unless I'm actually attending a game.)  Now, due to the impending lockout next September and the fact that the aging stars of the Red Wings aren't getting any younger, this team seems like it's going to be broken apart.  I have a feeling that this is probably the end of what may have been the greatest era of Red Wings hockey.  This is how I prefer to remember this era:

      I swear that I'm not gay, but I love grocery shopping.  Today, when I went to University Mall to find a Mother's Day present, I decided to check out  urlLink A Southern Season  for the first time.  How the fuck did I not go to this place in the four years I've been down here?!?!  I basically drooled the whole time I was there, from all the different salsas to imported handmade pasta to $10 pasta sauces to other foods and wines from the South and around the world.  I lost myself for an hour, and I actually enjoyed it as much as I do shopping for music.  But I'm straight, I swear!

      Unless you leave a comment, I don't know exactly who reads this weblog.  This blog gets an average of seven hits per day, and through the sitemeter tracker that lets me know these statistics, I can tell if the reader is someone I probably know (if it's a direct hit or through a friend's blog's link) or if they're total strangers.  For example, I've found many times there are those who stumble across this blog who I guess are either in a band or someone who's interested in a band or artist.  I'll know this because there have been times when someone will look up a band or song on Google and come across my blog...most likely because of the playlists from  urlLink WXYC  I put up.  So, for those of you who come across Action Potential as a Google searcher, welcome to my stupid blog.  My name is John, and I'm the handsomest motherfucker alive.  If you're confused by the playlists, they're playlists of my radio shows on  urlLink WXYC , which is the best fucking college radio station in the world and the best station not named  urlLink WFMU .  And I say all this with all due respect to  urlLink KCOU , where I DJ-ed from Fall of '96 to August 2000 and to which I'm forever indebted.  And also with all due respect to WCBN, KZSU, KUSF, and WXDU.  But WXYC has got to be the best college station - I can't imagine a better station, at least musically.  I think I may have only one more show left at WXYC (next Wednesday 6-9 PM Eastern Time), which is very sad.

      from  urlLink The Onion   WASHINGTON, DC‚ÄîIn an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.

      Since I found Jesus Christ in a haze of marijuana smoke one night in which the Jesus on the back window this Mexican's car started talking to me, I've decided to give up drinking except on Sundays in which I have a sip of the blood of Christ at the 11:45 mass at the Newman Center.  But I might make an exception tonight.  First, I'll attend Tom and Jessica's annual Cinco de mayo party for some tequila and free food.  Then I might go to Hell, where it'll be "Porn Night," where there'll be events such as Porn Trivia and "Porn-aoke" (porn karaoke), and I think they'll be giving away free porn.  I'll just stand outside the door and pass out bibles.  Then, to finish off the night, it'll be the second annual Underwear Party at Jason and Whitney's.  My friends,  urlLink Tim , Todd, and Isaac, will be DJ-ing.  I've actually been debating on whether to go to this or not because I'm out of shape, especially around the midsection, but, whatever, I'm going.  I'll just stand outside and pass out bibles.  Of course, the heavy rain outside could change my plans...

      There are so many things going on that I don't have the time and patience to sit here at my friends' apartment and type away.  And I won't have internet at my place until July 7th.  One thing about living in Chicago is that I'm always busy doing something.  I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing, but so far I like it.  I also love just being able to walk to places.  Gas is very expensive here, but at the rate I use my car, I spend a hell of a lot less on gas here than I did in Chapel Hill.  I actually haven't been to a gas station here yet and probably won't for at least another couple of weeks.  Everybody, conservative, moderate, and liberal, should go see Fahrenheit 9/11 if you haven't yet.  For the best review, go  urlLink here .  The Magnetic Fields are playing today for the third consecutive night here in Chicago.  I didn't go, but last night at a dance party at the  urlLink Hideout , Stephen Merritt showed up to scope out boys.  I said, "Dude, I'm straight, but if you want to make out, my friend Sean's interested."  Just kidding, Sean.  To my boyz and gals in North Cackalack, Missourah, and across the country and globe, come visit.  I'll be DJ-ing at my friends' July 4th party and also on the 5th at this club/bar, Vertigo.  Word.

      This is my sixth day in Chicago, and I've been incredibly busy everyday.  But since all of you are so anxious for an update, here's one, albeit short.  I promise a more comprehensive one at a later date, when I get the internet set up at my apartment.  The trip up here sucked, but, overall, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  West Virginia was horrible.  I don't give a shit if it's pretty because of the mountains...there are just too many fucking white-trash rednecks and most of the state looks like a huge industrial dump.  Plus, the only radio stations I could pick up were bad modern rock and pop, country, or Christian.  There are no hip hop stations in West Virginia because they hate blacks.  I was VERY relieved to cross the border in fucking Kentucky of all places...since only inbreds come out of Kentucky.  That's how bad West Virginia is.  I'm now officially an Illinois resident, with my new driver's licencse and Illinois plates.  Don't worry, y'all, I'm still Tar Heel and Show-Me bred.  Tonight I'm going to a special early screening of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.  Eat a dick, y'all.

      (From  urlLink The Onion )   Mugger Can't Believe Crap Victim Has On MP3 Player   BOSTON ‚Äî Following the successful mugging of a jogger in Franklin Park, petty criminal Derek Mesker announced Monday that he cannot believe the shit he's found on his victim's Philips 20GB MP3 player. "3 Doors Down? Maroon 5!" Mesker said, scrolling through the songs. "The new Counting Crows?! Man, I'm glad I pistol-whipped that motherfuck." Mesker added that the first thing he did was toss the device's "gay-ass" teal neoprene case.  **********************************  This is your humble narrator's last entry from the great town of Carrboro in the great state of North Carolina.  I've now lived in North Carolina a total of nine and a half years of my life, second only to the ten I lived in Missouri, and it's about time to leave for the second time.  I've got one last thing to say to Chapel Hill-Carrboro (and I'm being sincere):  I'll miss you, bitch.  Now it's time to pack up my computer.

      I went to CD Alley for the last time before heading out to Chicago (in less than five days!).  I actually was prepared to spend a shitload of money and load up on stuff I've been meaning to buy for a while now because CD Alley consistently has the cheapest prices for records and CDs than anywhere else.  But a few minutes after walking in, I had to take a huge piss, and I decided to rush so I could go home and urinate in my toilet...I'm lazy, so it wasn't an option for me to come back later or tomorrow.  Besides, I'm closing my bank account soon.  So I didn't really get an opportunity to fully explore the store and splurge as I originally intended...however, my selections were stellar, I must say.  My favorite has to be  urlLink Forever Version , the fabulous 1971 Studio One record from Dennis Alcapone.  Other winners:  Various Artists - Watch How the People Dancing: Unity Sounds from the London Dancehall, 1986-1989 ,  The Fall - The Rough Trade Singles Collection ,  DNA - DNA on DNA ,  The Homosexuals CD , and the new split single from  Cold Sides  and  Sorry About Dresden .  Oh, since you're dying to know, the piss was one of the most relieving ones I've ever had.

      They should be up 3-0, but I'll take 2-1.  Larry Brown is the best coach, bar none.  I still think Carolina should've gone after him (he would've come) and groom Phil Ford to become the next head coach in ten or so years, which, despite Brown's age, would still reel in the top recruits because everybody loves Phil and everyone would want to play for Larry Brown and Phil Ford.  Even though I think Roy is a hell of a coach and will do great here, I personally don't know if I can ever fully embrace him because of his ties to Kansas.   Rasheed Wallace has been underwhelming the whole series thus far, but I don't care since the Pistons are up.  'Sheed's always been one of my favorite players not because of his abilities, but because he cracks me up.  He argues so dramatically on every foul called, even if it's obviously a foul.  Off the court, he acts as if he doesn't give a fuck.  Even with the throwback jersey craze of this hip hop generation in which even many NBA athletes wear jerseys of different players and teams, he came into the arena before the game tonight wearing his own Piston jersey.  Fucking hilarious.   urlLink Here are more reasons why Rasheed Wallace is awesome.   During a commercial, I was flipping through the channels, and I came across the Beastie Boys performing their new single on the MTV Movie Awards.  I hadn't listened to the Beastie Boys in forever, and I forgot how much they can't rap worth shit.  I'm convinced only stupid white people are still into them because "they're the Beastie Boys and they fucking kick ass!"  I have to admit the production of the song sounds alright, and I like the fact that they still utilize an actual DJ.  The Beastie Boys still suck, however.

      My friend  urlLink Todd  let me do his show tonight, and I'm back from doing my last show on  urlLink WXYC .  (Sniff.)  Actually, I don't feel bad at all...like I kind of did after what I thought was my last show on May 12th.  But I have other things on my mind, like how I got screwed by those bitches at Sandbox Automatic and how I have to pack and clean next Thursday for my move the following morning.  I was really nervous at first because I wanted my last show to be perfect.  It wasn't, but I think it was a good show, and my nerves faded quickly.  Cy Rawls called around 7:00 to tell me that my show was really good.  I taped it, and I'll have a better idea of how good (or bad) it was after I listen to it.  Right now, I'd rate it as a B+...not a shabby way to end.  Anyway, here's the playlist:    (H) Lizzy Mercier Descloux - Funky Stuff Material - Take a Chance Switch - Next to You (H) The Lafayette Afro Rock Band - Voodounon  (M) Susie Ibarra - Awit Sa Trabaho Terem Quartet - Peddlers Sex Mob - Translation 2  (H) My Dear Ella - Set Me Running The Letters - Nobody Loves Me (off the comp This is Mod!) Superchunk - The Majestic Rita Lee - Vamos Tratar Da Saude  (S) Pit er Pat - Bog Man Mahjongg - Countdown (the Chicken)   Casino Versus Japan - Summer Clip Yellow Magic Orchestra - Computer Games (H) Yesterday's New Quintet - You've Got It Bad Girl  Boris Kovach & Ladaaba Orchest - Balkatino (H) David Darling & the Wulu Bunun - Lugu Lugu Kan-Ibi Kingsbury Manx - Piss Diary (H) The Tokens - How Nice (off the comp Hallucinations...)  (M) Aroah - Vigo The Dead C - Bitcher Mars - Helen Forsdale Iggy Pop and Sonic Youth - I Wanna Be Your Dog (Live '87)  (S) Spectac - Reasons   (R) Prince Paul & De La Soul - More Than U Know Kenny Knots - Run Come Call Me (M) Keith Hudson - Flesh of My Skin Joe Bataan - Latin Strut  (H) The Animal Collective - Leaf House Greg Ashley - Mona Rider Amps for Christ - The Morlough Shore  (H) Mary Lou Williams - Kool Bonga Rev.

      Even though, at the ripe age of 27, I may be too young (and ignorant) to fully realize the whole scope of things political, but has there ever really been a Republican president who actually was a good president that made the whole country better and not worse?  I ask this because ever since Reagan died this past week, the media has made it seem like he's the greatest president this country has ever seen.  I realize that it's not really polite to bring out negatives in the wake of someone's death, especially an ex-president's...but this is getting ridiculous.  I've read that there are some in Congress who want to get rid of Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill and replace it with Reagan or replace FDR on the dime with Reagan or replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill.  And there are people who want Reagan's face on Mount Rushmore.  I'm sorry, but just because a president was "personable" and seemed likable do not hide the damage he caused.  Now I'm dreading the day Dubya dies because I can see the same kind of thing happening, even though, in reality, he's by far the worst president in the past fifty years, maybe ever.

      Obviously everybody has dealt with businesses they've been impressed with and not impressed with.  My first and only dealing with Sandbox Automatic has sucked so much ass I'm getting ready to report those motherfuckers to BBB.  Two weeks ago I ordered some records from them, mostly because they carried the Coup's "5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO" single.  I noticed that they never sent a confirmation email like any online business would do.  I also noticed that my card had been charged the day I placed the order.  I've been waiting and waiting and still no records from them.  Finally, yesterday, I called them to see what was up, and they seemed to have no clue and asked me to submit an online inquiry form and they would get back to me asap.  (They also said that they don't send confirmation emails.)  I still haven't heard from those bastards, and if they still have no clue tomorrow, I'm going to demand a refund and/or report them to BBB.  Conversely, I would recommend  urlLink Eclipse Records  to anyone...well, if you're into psychedelic and experimental music, that is.  I ordered some records from them less than a week ago, and on the day I made the order, I got a call from the owner telling me that I could save a lot of money if I went with media mail, even though their website says they only send things 2-Day Priority Mail.  And I still got my records today.  Interestingly, even though cell phone companies have shitty reputations, I've been somewhat impressed with Verizon Wireless.  I got a bill today telling me that I owed almost a hundred bucks because I never paid last month's bill.  I rarely, if ever, am late in paying my bills, and so I thought this had to have been a mistake.  I checked all my records and my checkbook, and I noticed that the last time I wrote out a check to Verizon, it was two months ago...however, I also noticed that I never received a bill last month...whether it was Verizon's fault or the post office or one of my roommates misplacing it or throwing it away, I don't know.  (And it's never my fault because I'm always right.)  All I know is that I never received the bill; hence, I didn't pay.  I have no qualms about paying both last month's and this month's bills; but I don't think I should have to pay the late fee.  So I called them ready to argue my case, but they, to my surprise, agreed to waive the late fee without any argument.  So, Eclipse Records gets a gold star.  Verizon Wireless gets one thumb up.  And Sandbox Automatic gets a flaming bag of shit...and I'm getting ready to wage a personal jihad against them.

      Not to sound cocky, but I consider myself a pretty good radio DJ.  I won't be doing radio when I move up to Chicago, but I want to continue DJ-ing.  I'm looking to spin at parties and at clubs, which a few of my friends said they can hook me up with.  I have little doubt that I'll be good...however, having never spun at parties or at clubs, I'm finding that the technical skill of this type of DJ-ing is a little tougher than I expected.  I know it takes some time and practice, but I'm impatient.  I want to be good right away.

      I met up with a few people at Club Foot last night to have a few drinks, hours after promising myself not to spend any more money.&nbsp; But I only ended up buying one beer for myself since others were willing to buy me and everyone else drinks.   While we were sitting there enjoying our drinks, this guy who looks like Luke from the Dukes of Hazzard came up to us and handed us flyers of his band.   He said, "We're playing this weekend, and you should check us out.&nbsp; Do you like the Clash?&nbsp; If you do, you'll probably like us.&nbsp; Do you like Joy Division?&nbsp; We're strongly influenced by them.&nbsp; Do you like Franz Ferdinand?&nbsp; If you do, you'll probably like us.&nbsp; Come check us out."&nbsp; Then he proceeded to namecheck other bands from the punk/post-punk era that&nbsp;stupid hipsters are into and also&nbsp;bands of today that stupid hipsters dig, like the Rapture, Radio 4, and Franz Ferdinand.&nbsp; Yes, he was the lamest motherfucker ever.&nbsp; I thought to myself, "There can't be a level of lameness more lame than what I just witnessed."  But he outdid himself fifteen minutes later when he came back and&nbsp;said, "Go check out our website and take a listen for yourself.&nbsp; If you're into cool music, I think you'll like it.&nbsp; If not, that's cool, too.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot to mention, Sire Records is going to be at our show to check us out.&nbsp; You guys heard of Sire, right?&nbsp; You know, the Talking Heads, Blondie, and others.&nbsp; Yeah, they're going to be there to check us out."   I wish I had a video of all that.&nbsp; I also wish I could remember the name of his band.

      Wow.&nbsp; Tonight I saw the future in  urlLink Barack Obama . In case you haven't heard, he's being called the Tiger Woods, the new golden boy, and the future of the Democratic party...and a possible future presidential nominee, even though, for the time being, he's only an Illinois state senator.&nbsp; I hadn't even heard of him until fairly recently when  urlLink Tim  mentioned him to me a couple of weeks before I moved to Chicago. And once I moved up here, there's been so much hype around him in the news, especially in the wake of Jack Ryan's troubles.&nbsp; Still, like most people, I didn't really&nbsp;understand the hype because I didn't really know him and had never seen him speak.&nbsp; Until tonight.   I&nbsp;caught Hilary and Bill Clinton's speeches last night and Al Gore's today on the  urlLink DNC website .&nbsp; I really liked Bill Clinton's speech while Hilary's and Gore's were alright but kind of underwhelming, I thought...although I especially liked Gore's part in addressing voters for Nader in 2000...asking them, "Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?"   Tonight I was excited to hear Howard Dean speak, but he was also a bit underwhelming.&nbsp; So was Teresa Heinz Kerry.&nbsp; Although I agreed with Ron Reagan and&nbsp;supporting stem cell research, I thought he might have oversold it a little, maybe putting a&nbsp;bit too much optimism into it being the miracle he envisions it becoming.&nbsp; But the Democrats hit a home run tonight by having Barack Obama as the keynote speaker.&nbsp; He started off well, but you could literally see him picking up confidence and momentum as the speech went on, and it was perhaps the best speech I've ever seen.&nbsp; I wish I was at the Fleet Center to witness it in person and give a well-deserved standing ovation.&nbsp; One of the PBS analysts said that Obama's introduction to the national public via his speech&nbsp;tonight&nbsp;was transcendent across Republicans and Democrats,&nbsp;blacks and whites, men and women, and others.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly.   It's quite a shame that the major networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) didn't air tonight's convention, although I'm assuming that the cable networks did.&nbsp; (The Chicago ABC, NBC, and CBS affiliates only broadcasted Obama's speech.)&nbsp; If you missed Obama's speech and you have high speed internet, go to the  urlLink DNC website &nbsp;and watch it.&nbsp; I doubt that any other speaker during the convention in the next two days will even come close to matching his speech.

      Yesterday a bunch of us headed to the beach...in Indiana.&nbsp;  urlLink Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore  to be more specific. Because of traffic and highway construction outside of Chicago, we got there later than planned, and by the time we got there, there was literally no place to park. At 2:30, we actually did find a place to park...however, it would've been a 30-minute walk to the beach from where we were, and Jeff had to be back in Chicago for work starting at 6:00, which meant that we wouldn't be at the beach very long&nbsp;since it would take us almost two hours to get back to Chi-town&nbsp;because of said highway construction and traffic.&nbsp; So the other car stayed while we headed back.&nbsp; So I didn't get to catch the surf at the famed beaches of Indiana.&nbsp; Everybody has told me, however, including someone from North Carolina, that the Indiana Dunes are really nice.   I met up with my friend, Kat, and got a few drinks and went to a party on Saturday.&nbsp; We talked about many things, including today's emo kids and Eddie Murphy's hit song from the 80s, which she played on the jukebox&nbsp;(was it "Party All the Time"?...I can't remember).&nbsp; But the best thing we talked about was in regard to&nbsp;many of the great restaurants of Chicago, most of which I've never been to.&nbsp; Sean, Kat, and I got excited, and soon (maybe this week?) I hope to be going to  urlLink Soul Vegetarian  in the South Side, this very Afro-centric soul-food vegan and vegetarian place&nbsp;that everybody says is the best place ever.   Shit, I hear Toby Keith singing on the TV in the living room, which means I need to head out there and mosh.

      The past several days have been&nbsp;some of the laziest days I've had in quite a while.&nbsp; Chicago's been unbearably hot and humid (and thunderstormy)&nbsp;this week, just about reaching Missouri and North Carolina levels of temperature and humidity...and I realized that I don't have central air conditioning in my apartment after all.&nbsp; But today and for at least the next four to five days the weather should be awesome.&nbsp; It's sunny and beautiful and the temperature is in the mid-to-upper seventies.&nbsp; Everybody's at work right now, but shit, maybe I should get out this afternoon, maybe walk over to  urlLink Dusty Groove .&nbsp; I kind of wanted to hit the new  urlLink Millennium Park , but parts of it is closed this weekend because of some fundraiser.&nbsp; Maybe I'll go next week.   I was watching the local&nbsp;news sometime this week, and there was a story on how the Maywood/Melrose Park/west suburbs-area is the most violent and dangerous part of Chicago, even worse than the infamous South Side.&nbsp; The murder rate and&nbsp;drug trafficking&nbsp;in this area&nbsp;are higher than any other part of the city.&nbsp; And I start my job there on August 19th!&nbsp; I just saw online that there's a job opening someplace in the northern suburbs that's most likely safer and pays better.&nbsp; I'm thinking I should call to inquire about the job today.   In between the hot, humid, and rainy days this week and me being so lazy and refusing to bathe since I'd just start sweating badly anyway, I sat and watched a lot of TV.&nbsp; I don't have cable, but there are a surprising number of free channels here.&nbsp; One of them is an all-Korean channel.&nbsp; I've been watching a bit of that trying to understand what they're saying.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;been another reminder of how much my Korean sucks.&nbsp; I've also been watching some Cubs baseball since you can't get away from it here in Chicago.&nbsp; I used to be a baseball fanatic when I was in elementary school, but I've lost a lot of interest since then.&nbsp; However, I took great satisfaction in watching the St. Louis Cardinals bitchslap the Cubs for their two-game sweep at Wrigley.

      A couple of days ago a friend and I took a 90-minute roadtrip to  urlLink Columbia , Missouri, the college town&nbsp;where the  urlLink University of Missouri &nbsp;resides and&nbsp;where&nbsp;my friends and I lost a third of&nbsp;our brain cells due to the amount of alcohol consumed.&nbsp; (I remember buying&nbsp;24-packs of Milwaukee's Best long neck bottles for $5&nbsp;and 40's of Pabst and Mickey's for $1.29 each.&nbsp; Sigh.)&nbsp;   Although&nbsp;I've&nbsp;spent some of the best&nbsp;times of my life there, I can't picture myself ever living&nbsp;in Columbia&nbsp;again, even though Money Magazine consistenly ranks the small city as one of the best places in the country to live.&nbsp; Interestingly, I can easily see myself moving back to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, if I ever get sick of living in a large city...because I ain't ever going to live in the suburbs.  &nbsp;  Just walking around Columbia was kind of weird...the city has changed in many ways but is still the same.&nbsp; The Heidelberg, my favorite place to drink alcohol and home to the great late night happy hours (10:30&nbsp;PM&nbsp;to 12:30 AM), cheap, strong, and large&nbsp;Long Island Ice Teas, and hot waitresses, is being rebuilt into this massive more modern-looking building after being burned to the ground in a fire a year or so ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Osama's, this Turkish-owned coffee joint next the the 'Berg, is now a Lion's Choice, a fast food joint specializing in roast beef sandwiches.  &nbsp;  The highlight of the day trip was going to  urlLink Shakespeare's Pizza , Columbia's finest pizza joint.&nbsp; Lots of people swear by Shakespeare's, saying it's the best pizza anywhere.&nbsp; (You can actually mailorder a&nbsp;frozen Shakespeare's pizza wherever you live, although you can no longer have meat toppings if you do this because of the USDA regulations.)&nbsp; I remember having Shakespeare's for the first time the day I moved into the dorms my freshman year.&nbsp; I've always thought it was quite good, although I never thought it was the best.&nbsp; I personally think the pizzas at  urlLink Pepper's &nbsp;in Chapel Hill&nbsp;taste better, although this chick I dated disagreed after visiting me in Chapel Hill in 2000.&nbsp; (But if you get pizza at Pepper's, you have to get the pie, not just&nbsp;individual slices since the pies are freshly made.)&nbsp; But Shakespeare's wins hands down for its atmosphere...you can actually hang out and drink there and not just have pizza.  &nbsp;  In other news, I've taken four large shits in the past couple of hours.&nbsp; I feel like I've given birth, and I feel so light I think&nbsp;can dunk a basketball.

      I used to check sitemeter every other day to see how many hits this blog gets a day and how they get to it...like if it's a direct hit or a referral from another site or whatever.  Since moving, however, I rarely ever check it.  But I decided to log in and check sitemeter today, and apparently someone found this blog doing a web search using these key words:  "hot gay latin boys fucking."  Maybe it's time to either retire this blog, or maybe I should stop using the word "gay" so often when describing things, like this blog.  I'm thinking the latter.

      I'm at my parents' house in Missouri right now, and they still use dial-up for their internet, which is making surfing for porn very, very frustrating.  I'm not even sure if this entry will make my gay-ass blog.  I guess I'd forgotten exactly how hot and humid this state is until I arrived last night.  This is even worse than North Carolina.  Chicago's weather is weird...one day it'll be 90 degrees, and the next day it'll be 70.  Personally, I prefer the 70 degree weather even though it's weird wearing a jacket in June and July.  Of course, the trip from Chicago to St. Louis via I-55 was fucking boring as hell.  Two things that helped were the hip hop/R&B CDs my good friend,  urlLink Tim , made for a bunch of people last winter.  There's nothing like Beyonce, Jay-Z, R. Kelly, and more to help tolerate shitty Illinois.  Thanks, Tim.  I'm glad Kerry has chosen John Edwards to be his running mate.  I like Edwards, although I prefer that "crazy radical" Dennis Kucinich and the "ultra-leftist"Howard Dean over all others.  Oh yeah, I also like Al Sharpton.  I also would prefer Edwards as the presidential candidate and Kerry as the vice-presidential nominee, but this will have to do.  I think Edwards was a much better choice than Gephardt, and this will only help Kerry.  I'm not a huge fan of Kerry, but anything's better than Bush.  I'd rather have someone with mental retardation as our president than Bush...but then again, Bush may very well be mentally retarded.  I've never blamed Nader for Bush winning in 2000 but rather the incompetence of the Democrats coupled with the Republicans cheating.  I sort of wish Nader wouldn't run this time, but I personally am not mad at him for running nor will I blame him for Bush winning again should that happen.  I do understand, however, the anger some feel about Nader running.  But I think if Kerry, Edwards, and the Democrats do what they're supposed to do, they should win regardless of the 5% Nader holds in recent polls.  Despite Kerry not even being close to my ideal candidate, I'm voting for him for sure.  I've been telling people that having Kerry as president is like being kicked in the balls, but Bush again in office is like having testicular cancer.  I'd rather be kicked in the nuts than have testicular cancer.  When I started this stupid weblog, I was going to write whatever was on my mind, including politics.  But expressing most of my political views is like preaching to the choir, at least to my loyal fanbase.  Besides, I'm not a very good writer, and two of my friends,  urlLink Tim  and  urlLink Fred , each do excellent jobs writing about things political.  So this was a rare occasion.  I promise I'll get back to writing about bitches and hoes in the near future.  Good day.

      The rooftop at my friends' apartment should be crazy, from what everybody tells me.  BBQ, alcohol, lots of people, and fireworks from 360 degress around us with the skyline as the backdrop sound awesome.  Wolf Eyes were great last night.  So were Sunn O))), who were fucking creepy as well, with their smoke machine and all.  I think much of the crowd just came for Wolf Eyes and may not have been into the sludgy metal Earth tribute band.  I thought they were great.  Okay, it's now time to start the grill.

         urlLink Fred  flew up to Chicago to visit this past weekend, and he couldn't have come up at a better time. The weather was near perfect, and the Million Tongues Festival at the  urlLink Empty Bottle  was happening. I think the city left a very good impression on him, and hopefully within the next year Chicago will claim another citizen.  Going up the  urlLink John Hancock Center  was probably the highlight of Friday. Although the Sears Tower is the (3rd?) tallest building in the world, everyone had told me that the view from the Handcock is better. Instead of paying $9.50 to go up to the  urlLink Observatory  on the 94th floor, we went up to the Signature Room on the 96th floor for free, where we could buy alcohol from the bar while enjoying the view. It would've been a great place to take a date, but Fred was a good alternative.   Later, we met up with Kat at her place of work and then went to this bar to have a couple of drinks before she headed off to O'Hare for a wedding in Asheville. We had a good time, although I wish she would've been able to hang out more this weekend.   Saturday, Fred, Luke, and I spent the day at the new  urlLink Millennium Park , and we were all thoroughly impressed. Later that night, a bunch of us (including my roommate Jeff and my new ladyfriend) headed off to the South Side to hit the original and best  urlLink Soul Vegetarian , where even the most stringent meat-atarians are left craving for more.  Saturday's Million Tongues Festival featured Michael Yonkers, Charalambides, Matt Valentine &amp; Erika Elder, and PG Six. We caught the last ten minutes of PG Six...it was good but not amazing. Matt Valentine and Erika Elder came out and weirded many out with their performance art...but within ten minuntes of their set they started to settle down and played some awesome avant-psych-folk music which reminded me a bit of Avarus and other Finnish psych-folk music. Charalambides came out next and completely wowed me. (I'd never seen them before, although I saw Christina Carter give a very nice, albeit short set a couple of weeks ago.) Even Maria was impressed, and she bought one of their CDs. Michael Yonkers was a huge disappointment. I really liked his album that Sub Pop released last year, but his performance was monotonous and boring. We all left early.  To make a long story short, Fred missed his flight on Sunday, and Delta can lick everyone's ass. Fuck Delta. But it did give us an opportunity to see more of the city and also attend the last night of the Million Tongues Festival. Besides the Pacific Coast Highway in California (which I've never been on), I don't know if there's a better street to drive through anywhere than Chicago's Lake Shore Drive. We drove and parked in the area where  urlLink Shedd Aquarium ,  urlLink Field Museum , and  urlLink Soldier Field  are located.  If you want the best view of the skyline, go there.  Here's a pic:   Due to a late dinner, we got to the the Empty Bottle late, thus missing Fursaxa and only catching the last couple of songs from Paul Flaherty and Chris Corsano. We did catch Six Organs of Admittance, who again wowed me. Simon Finn, in his first US performance, completely charmed everyone in the audience.  I woke up at 4:45 AM the next morning to take Fred to Midway. It was a great weekend, and I'm hoping that Chicago will claim another Chapel Hill resident in the near future.  I typically try to avoid "diary-type" entries, but one of the reasons for this entry is to send a message to all my friends/bitches/fans out there, which is COME VISIT, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!  Fred has tons of pics up.   urlLink Check it out.

      I went to the  urlLink Empty Bottle  Saturday for the Oneida show. Besides Oneida, there were three other bands playing first, none of whose music I had listened to before, I don't think. The first band was Chicago's Plastic Crimewave Sound. I was especially interested in seeing them since they have some releases off  urlLink Eclipse Records . Their brand of psych-punk didn't floor me, although I did enjoy their set. One thing I didn't like was that the singer's voice reminded me of Billy Corgan, at least that's how it sounded to me live. But the vocals were mostly drowned out by the instruments, thank god. Also, their Asian female guitarist has the coolest stage presence ever. She just stood there wearing shades, a hoodie, and a dress just strumming her guitar but looking very cool while doing so. During Plastic Crimewave Sound's set, there was this dude dancing like a retarded jackass, combining his dance moves with muscle stretches. He was showing off, but he looked like an idiot. Others agreed with me.  The second band was this dance-punk trio from New York called Breaker! Breaker!. They sucked. I left the room to play Tetris on my cellphone.  The third band was a band I heard only one of my friends likes while everybody else hates them. They were obnoxious on stage, and their music was pretentiously sucky. They reminded me of retarded people trying to play Captain Beefheart. And the jackass I mentioned earlier that dance-stretched to Plastic Crimewave Sound was in the band. Oh yeah, their name is No Doctors. They sucked.  Oneida came on last and played a set that pleased most, if not all, the Oneida fans in the audience. They came out and stated, "We're Oneida, and tonight we're from Chicago!" which obviously pleased the audience. One thing I didn't like about the set (and it's a huge pet peeve of mine for some rock shows) was that the vocals were too low. For 90% of the set, you could barely hear any vocals. Although I enjoyed Oneida's set, I doubt the performance would've won over many new fans who had never listened to them before, mostly because you couldn't hear any vocals. Their encore was the best part of the evening since they played my favorite song from them, "Sheets of Easter."  This week...the Million Tongues Festival.  I love Chicago.
