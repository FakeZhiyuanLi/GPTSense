      To cheer you from your beds, because it is almost morning, have the first three verses of  urlLink The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , in the stonking first translation of Edward FitzGerald:   I  AWAKE! for Morning in the Bowl of Night  Hath flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:  And Lo! the Hunter of the East hath caught  The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.    II  Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky  I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,  "Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup  Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."    III  And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before  The Tavern shouted--"Open then the Door!  You know how little while we have to stay,  And, once departed, may return no more."    (If this sounds familiar but you don't know why, you probably have heard the most famous stanza:  Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,  A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse--and Thou  Beside me singing in the Wilderness--  And Wilderness is Paradise enow.)    ...anyway it's a great poem, all about getting drunk,  carpe diem -ing and not fussing about any afterlife bollocks or any of that..  There's some weird stuff about Jesus that Mr FitzGerald saw fit to shoehorn in, but ignore that.

      No picture today, just a  Useful Tip .  When cooking home-made meatballs, do not fry them.  Instead, lay them on a baking tray and bung them in the oven.  When they're done, add them to the pan of sauce so they can sort of marinade in it for a bit, to prevent their being dry.  This has 2 benefits: 1. You use less oil if you bake them, which is Healthy. 2. They won't fall apart in the frying pan, which makes you look Less Inept.

      As a change from kittens, here are some lemurs:  Big Lenny wasn't the sharpest tool in the box, but he had great reach.     And if there's anything more beautiful than lemurs in Springtime, I don't need to know about it...    I've also got that as a  urlLink wallpaper , but be warned: it's a big hooj.

      This weekend I went to a lovely party, with lots of lovely people, and then the next day we all went for a jolly walk across Hampstead Heath.  Ah, it was great!  In other cheerful news,  urlLink Green & Blacks  have brought out a new dark chocolate bar with dried cherries in.  It is lush, and if you are feeling a bit down then you have Dr Kitten's permission to go out and buy one bar, and eat it all yourself.  Only one mind, because they are a bit huge, and I don't want you feeling sick or not eating all your dinner.

      The sun is out in Leeds for once, and the light through the branches of the silver poplar outside our window is all dappled and swishy.  How nice.  It is the ideal time to sit up in bed with a laptop and a cafetiere of fine  (organic, fairtrade, amazonian bird-friendly - you better believe it)  coffee.  I wish I had some croissants too, but never mind - this guy does.

      Okay, *rolls up sleeves* here we go.  Something nice, and a picture.  Yesterday, as well as starting my soon-to-be-glittering blogging career, I started playing  urlLink Neopets .  Here is a picture of mine, whose name is Edoinidd:    ...he's kind of a cross between "cute" and "I shouldn't beeeeeeeeeee!" so I hope that will do y'all for now.  Don't anyone go pootling off to Neopets and start challenging him in the Battledome, will you - he's a pacifist and I'm feeding him lots of books.

      I found this remorseful looking kitten and failed to come up with a good enough thought to go into his bubble.  (Yes, I did think of "oh God, what have I done?" and "Alas, poor mousie - I knew him well".  I'm not  remedial.)    So I thought I would instigate a COMPETITION!   urlLink Email me  with your captions and when I find one funny, I will send that person a PRIZE.  A REALLY, REAL PRIZE.  Honest.  A nice one.

      When I first came across  urlLink LUSH  I got very excited and thought they were quite the bee's knees.  Then I tried out a few products that were a bit disappointing, and got miffed, and stopped shopping there very much.  They've brought out tons of new stuff since then, though, and when I popped back in I realised some of it is really jolly good, so here are my recommendations for "falling-back-in-love-with-LUSH" stuff.   Arabian Bright hair mask  - smells wonderful and spicy, makes your hair shiny.  Only for brunettes and needs washing out thoroughly.  Pied De Pepper foot cream  - also spicy, and so nice that just after putting it on, someone once asked me what my wonderful perfume was...!  Skinny Dip shower gel  - I sometimes go to the bathroom and open the bottle just for a sniff - I love cloves, and white chocolate, and violets, and this has all three, which is a result.  Buffy the Backside Slayer  - you need one of these.  Aqua Mirabilis  - more for special occasions, it's a really good rose-smelling exfoliating thingie.  Ceridwen's Cauldron "bath melt"  - so, SO good.  Ignore the bath ballistics that make your skin itch, go for this instead even though it's pricy.  Strawberry boat shower treatment  - also for special occasions, but WOW does it make your bum go smooth.  And it really smells like just-picked strawberries, a bit grassy and green.  Tisty tosty  - it is a bath ballistic but this one doesn't make my skin itch, and it's got ickle roses in.  Neither does  Rainbow Worrier , and that's rather nice too.  Writing the above down makes me wonder if I am not slightly obsessed with spice and rose smells, and exfoliating/moisturising products.  But there you have it.  Avoid the moisturisers and cleansers, and the bath bars which create extraordinary amounts of suds, and the funny-coloured ballistics which will stain your bath, and the deodorants that don't work.  And have a picture of a tiger in a bath, too, which I sent to the Lush times (they didn't use it).

      I bought some new shoes today from  urlLink New Look  - they are all pinky and round-toed, and they made me happy.  They were only £30 though, which makes me thing sweatshops... but look at the website!  New Look has an  urlLink Ethical Policy   (it's in the menu bar at the top)  that forbids the recruitment of manufacturing workers under 15 years of age, and insists on decent wages and hours.    I knew  urlLink H&M  and  urlLink IKEA  did similar, but they're Swedish.  Go and have a look, it's rather cheering.

      Right, let's have another bash at the old Top Tips thing.  Today's topic is:  Nail Varnish .  DO NOT buy nail varnish from Nails Inc, as it chips and peels very easily. DITTO Maybelline and Clarins - it never dries and it's all gunky. DO buy nail varnish from Rimmel if you are skint as it's very good although it won't keep long. ALWAYS use a base coat or your nails will go yellow.  This is especially true with dark polishes. REMEMBER to lay off the paint for a few days each week so the vitamin D can get to your nails and make them strong.  Eat lots of oily fish and spinach and stuff if your nails are weak. BEWARE of dark nail varnishes - they are lovely and vampy for evening but very aging to your hands in bright daylight. NEVER wear pale nail varnishes on your toes, because your feet will look ill.  Ignore anyone who says your hands and feet should match as they probably vote Tory. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you attempt to wear blue, yellow or green nail varnish.  This is for the under-15s and goth boys only.  Black can be okay sometimes though.  No, honestly, it can look very stylish.  And finally: the best brands are  urlLink Chanel , which does absolutely the prettiest, most flattering colours and  urlLink OPI , which has the best texture and keeps for ages.  You can get cheap OPI varnishes on  urlLink Ebay : in the shops it's about £7-£8, on ebay you shouldn't pay more than £4.

      Good morning, and welcome to another  GUEST CAT!!   I've decided to update these on Mondays, so there'll be at least one update per week for a while as we have quite a backlog.  This is Shadow, who lives with our previous Guest Cat, Dobby.  In the picture you can see her snuggling up to a Great Dane called Dylan, who is her God.  Shadow enjoys bothering Dylan, and in her spare time assists her brother Dobby in their bid for World Domination.

      I'm instigating another (hopefully) regular event, today, and it is  LITERARY CORNER .  Who knows, I might even make picture-logos and things, and add search facilities so you can find them all and stuff.  I doubt it, but all things are possible  (in the best of all possible worlds)   Today's book is  urlLink The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon .  It's written from the point of view of a boy with Asperger's and it brilliantly recreates his skewed-logical thought processes.  All the characters are beautifully drawn and treated with respect however mad or silly they are, and in all it is a book so moving you would cry whether the ending was happy or sad, although I'm not telling you which it is.

      With mighty apologies to Iola for the delay, here is our latest  GUEST CAT !!  This mighty beast belongs to Iola's friends.  His name is Dobby, and he was "hand reared from 3 days and knows no fear".  This was a rare occasion where he was sitting under the Christmas tree, not ripping it down.  Dobby is not impressed by fake bird ornaments, and dreams one day of World Domination.

She must be  quite  clever, as there was no blood or anything this time.  Not like that still-twitching pigeon she brought in a few months ago...

      Hooray for our second  GUEST CAT !  Remember, your cat can also be guest cat - simply  urlLink EMAIL ME  your pictures and a few salient facts.  This is CAP'N RIO, and yes, he is missing his right eye.  He lost it on the Spanish Main, if you must know.  Cap'n Rio likes coffee, processed ham, and dubloons.  He hopes for World Domination, through the medium of string and piracy.  YARRRR!

So here goes: I am Midnight Tumblings, I smoke a cigarette in a cigarette holder, wear a red silk dressing gown and address him as "Double Bovine,  I say".     That's atcherly Deeley in the pic, but she looks good, doesn't she?!

      Do you remember that heady time, long ago, when I posted my first picture on this blog and joined  urlLink Neopets ?  It was the very first day of this year, and I recall Leeds was so bitterly cold I decided to lie in bed all day and play computers...  no?  Ok.  Well anyway, Neopia has since eaten my life to quite an alarming extent - so much so that I got a friend in America to post me  urlLink this little fella , currently not available in the UK.  He squeaks!  He growls!  Bits of his head light up!    ...Nonetheless, Steve was not impressed.

        You know what day it is... you know what time it is... put your hands together, ladies and gentlemen, for today's  GUEST CAT , now with added logo!  Behold and marvel upon the face of JD (yes that's right he's named for a cheap whiskey) who is Roxy's brother.  Confusingly, he is the one with the copy of CHICAGO in the background, but it's definitely him.  He likes to sniff the pretty flowers in the garden, chase pens gaily across laminate floors and is keenly involved in the struggle for World Domination.

      My friend, whose blog is  urlLink here , found me  urlLink this .  (needs sound)   Isn't it jolly?  Dr Phil is a name I use on various messageboards, although I'm not bald or american or anything like that, so the song isn't really about me.  But, you know, it's still a wee ego-boost to hear the Camera Casanovas trilling my name repeatedly.

        urlLink     Hey, I've got a SUPER idea!  Why don't I do another competition?  Surely everyone likes free stuff, after all, and I only get about a dozen unique hits on here per day so the odds of winning will be great for everyone!  All you need to do is  urlLink email me  explaining  what kind of superhero you would like to be, and why .  You could even include a wee piccie if you liked.   I'll pick the best one, and put it in a SUPER-post on here, probably with a SUPER-photoshop, and I'll post you a SUPER-prize!  It really will be a prize this time, not just a pint when I see you next.  I reckon I'll give it 2 weeks to run, so you have plenty of time.  Hooray for prizes and superpowers!  GET GOING!

      It's time to welcome this week's  GUEST CAT!   This fearsome beast is Roxy, named for Roxy Hart in the musical Chicago.  They are both bewitchingly attractive and apparently harmless, yet both are also cold-blooded murderesses.  She is owned by Sam, who shares a house with Rory.  Roxy likes laminate flooring and in her idle moments ponders the forthcoming age of World Domination for cats.

      Hurrah for another  Literary Corner!   Today's book is  urlLink Astonishing Splashes of Colour, by Claire Morall .  This too has been out for ages in paperback - I'll try to read something a wee bit more up-to-date soon.  This book is great but often quite upsetting.  Like the first installment in this series, it's another book written from the viewpoint of someone whose mental scheme of things is slightly "off" from the norm.  Also, it's about children, and I don't like children, but I automatically sympathised with the concerns in this book - which goes to show how well realised it is.  And it's got ART and synasthesia and stuff in.  Woo!

      Against my better judgement:  urlLink He Is Vork.   There's a MEAN cat cartoon in there somewhere, which is the main reason why he isn't in the  Very Cool Sites  section.  Also, some of the jokes are a little obscure.  But he is very funny, so off you go.

      Whoopsie, a day late - I forgot.  A extra-big hand, then, everybody, for today's  GUEST CATS!!   That's right, there are two of them: Slim and Shady, brothers of our previous Guest Cat, Shadow.  And you may thank me for editing out the naked hairy man-leg that was on the left of this picture, too.  Slim and Shady like shiny jewellery, chewing each other's ears and dream one day of World Domination.  Bit like their namesake, actually...

      Just a brief post to wish everyone a jolly Bank Holiday Monday.  It is sunny here: I hope the weather with you is also fine.  I have decided to do no work today, and instead I shall lounge - I think lounge is the best word for it - on the grass outside my house, drinking proper coffee and eating maya gold, which I believe we have already established is  urlLink the best thing ever.   And to aid my kharma, lately I have added  urlLink this  to my list of daily bookmarks.  It would be especially nice if you did too.

      Honest Charlie ain't never sold a duff car in 'is life.    ...also, as promised: Out-of-Season  Christmas Biscuits   350g plain flour 100g dairy-free marg - you can use butter if you like. 100g soft light brown sugar 1 decently large egg 60g golden syrup  1 tsp baking powder 2 tsp ginger - more if you fancy 2 tsp cinnamon a good grinding of nutmeg if you have any  Sieve together the dry ingredients - 300g flour, spices, salt.  Rub in the marge/butter which is a good sticky job, then add the sugar.  Mix up the egg and the syrup throroughly, then beat into the rest of the biscuit mix, beating it well to get a bit of air in.    Roll it out all thin and delicate on a large, flat, CLEAN surface and cut into pussycat shapes - or stars, or circles or what have you.  You will also need to make a larger hole than you think in each if you're going to thread them on ribbons, as the dough will expand slightly during cooking.  Cook for about 15-20mins at 160 C or gas mark 3.  Be warned: this makes TONS of dough, and it's very sticky.  If you really can't manhandle it onto a flat surface, add more flour.  This recipe is adapted from Nigella's, which was too sticky and didn't taste of enough - I have added more spice and more flour.  I should add that, bar the baking powder, you can now get ALL the ingredients required from an Organic shop, and frankly I think you ought to.

             This is Charlie cat, who moved in with a fellow known as Down-on-the-Farm after deciding he didn't like all the cats and dogs he was previously living with. He is mean, moody and although less unpredictable than he was, apparently he's still the cat who will want to be stroked until he drools with ecstasy one minute, and the psycho who will actually chase you around the house if you upset him.  Charlie also sports a torn right ear from his days as a loony, and keenly anticipates the fullfilment of his plans for World Domination.

She is 12 years old, and her interests include catching frogs and World Domination.  Her owner, weevilstepmother, tells us that  "once, quite amazingly, I saw [Diddley] strutting proudly up the garden path bearing her prey, looking for all the world like some mad feline Fu Manchu. As she laid it adoringly at my feet, I could see that it was a blackened banana skin fearlessly stalked and captured within the compost heap."

It's not bad, not bad at all, and I live in hope that they will one day start producing the sort of chic little items you and I covet, instead of nice t-shirts and uber-basic paisley frocks.

        Morning all!  I do hope you all had as lovely a weekend as I - I went to a birthday party and shopped in Lunnon, and surveyed my friend's nice new flat in Limehouse with a view to a little hypothetical redesigning... top darts, overall!  But enough about me.  It's time to introduce this week's  GUEST CAT!  This is Nermal, who deigns to share her existence with Jinxx.  Jinxx has, rather inspiringly, written us a wee poem about Mighty Nermal:   she does not meow she goes 'Map' and she has fur of silk and she likes to stand around as if she's forgotten what she was doing   ...and of course, I have it on good authority that she looks forward greatly to the coming era of Cat World Domination.

      Before I whisk myself off for another heady weekend of parties and such, I thought I might remind you of these wonderful fellas:  urlLink Corky & the Juice Pigs .  As the site says, they've split up now, but they were the funniest live act I've ever seen (including Eddie Izzard, no lie) and their two CDs are hilarious.  Amongst other classics songs of theirs, you may have heard "The Only Gay Eskimo" and "The Pandas Must Die" - ah, they're great!  Have a jolly, chuckling weekend everyone!

      Right then, to the business of the day!  Firstly: sorry to anyone having trouble contacting me.   When you click the competition link it will send an email to drphilREMOVEkitten@yahooCAPS.com... which isn't my email address.  The REMOVE CAPS bit is supposed to be, well, removed, thus confounding spambots and keeping my inbox streamlined.  However it does seem to have confounded a few of my readers too, so I've fixed it and it'll just send normal emails now.  I love you all so, I will suffer spam for your sakes - greater love hath no kitten.  Anyway, on to more fun stuff -  COMPETITION WINNERS!  In Third place, we have  Mr L. Bucket , who dreamed of becoming "Super Only-Person-To-Enter-Dr-Phils-Competition-Man" because "it's true"... which it wasn't, but hey!  I smiled.  In Second place, we have  Ms A Harris , who suggested becoming Superwoman, but of an unusual kind:  I would wear comfy flats shoes and a fancy skirt without showing too much leg, and I would fly around the world helping ladies in need:  *foot rubs to those with sore feet...  *nail files to desparate women with broken nails...  *hair products to those suffering from bad hair days... *my extra special power would be to supply the fluffiest of kittens to those having really all round bad days   In the coveted  FIRST PLACE , however, is  Ms I Shaw , with the following entry:  I would be "superpurrfect", dedicating my life to  *the destruction of all who overfeed other peoples' cats...  *ensuring a continual supply of insects and interesting things for my feline friends to chase and eat... *cleansing the environment of nasty pollutants that harm all the wild creatures that cats just love to chase and play with...  *ensuring a plentyful supply of vitamin alcohol, chocolate and lard to sustain all those human pets that cats keep for their amuzement.  Humans being far more amuzing (and inclined to feed us pizza) when drunk.   ...in the end, it was rather a no-brainer, wasn't it?  Cats, booze, pizza and eco-bobbins.  A clear winner.  I'll photoshop a wee prize tonight, and post it tomorrow - congrats to Ms Shaw!!

      Today we are having a music recommendation:  urlLink FRANK, by Amy Winehouse.   I would strongly advise you to ignore the "customers who bought this record also bought" section, as Katie Melua is god-awful, as is Norah Jones...  although I do quite like Norah Jones...  anyway Katie Melua is dire, no question.  FRANK is great, though - v. smokey jazzy sorts of things, with utterly  filthy  (and sometimes quite clever) lyrics.  Some of the production is quite dance-y and innovative, and most of all, Amy Winehouse has an astounding voice.  Judging by her songs, she is also a dangerous lady to cross and a bit of a fruitloop in bed.  Hurrah!

        A bit late because of the bank holiday, it's time for your weekly  GUEST CAT!   This is Porcellina (or Poppy, as she's known).  Poppy likes to be upside down and wants to be a car mechanic. An able cheese thief and fly gourmand, she hopes to use her automotive skills in the struggle for world domination.        urlLink     Remember too, kids, that the SUPER competition still has one week left to run!  Just  urlLink send an email  to let me know what kind of superhero you would be and why, and you could win a prize!  In fact you almost certainly will, because no-one's entered yet... *sigh*

      Well, yesterday I went to a  urlLink Body Shop Party , and a jolly fun time we had too.  They're a little keen on the hard-sell but I know you are all strong enough to resist.  At present there's a sale on, too.  I spent £20 on frilly bits and had to wash myself thoroughly when I got home as I'd covered myself in so many samples I ended up quite sticky.  Many thanks to Katie for hosting it!

         ...yeah, this week's guest cat is late, just 'cos I, um, forgot.  Somebody please  urlLink give me a job .  PLEASE.  Right, this is Trouble.  She is about 12 weeks old now, and lives with MissPrism and her sister Morgan.  She likes climbing, exploring and biting Morgan on the ears. She didn't like falling ten feet from their balcony, but it doesn't seem to have done her any harm.  With such acrobatic abilities, the sucess of her quest for World Domination seems assured.

      Famous People who have been rightly fond of cats, part 1 of a series which may or may not continue:     urlLink    click "enter the site", bottom left     This film is BEYOND FANTASTIC, and you should see it as soon as it's out over here, which I think is in early September.  I will remind you again at the time, don't worry.  Thanks to the magic of the nintermawebby, I have seen it already and would recommend you watch out for the scene where Hellboy pauses in his bloodied fight with an infernal demon, to rescue a boxful of miawing kittens.  Oh yes.

       HOW TO SALES SHOP   ALWAYS start with a budget, and expect to go a tiny bit over - not more than 20%, say ALWAYS go to shops you can't normally afford - that's the point, silly ONLY go to H&M or simlar cheap shops if you are going on a summer holiday DO go once in the first week to get the beautiful bits DO go once after a few weeks to get the really, REALLY cheap bits  NEVER go more than twice to the same sale!  ALWAYS buy your leather & suede in the sales (if you wear skins) DO buy plain things - black trousis, warm jumpers etc. DO NOT try to second guess what will be trendy next season DO allow yourself one - but only one - thing which is simply pretty and warms your heart, however impractical.  REMEMBER places like Boots have sales too, so stock up on expensive makeup.  ...anyone got any more tips?

         This is a dancing kitten what my friend ZOG made for me - he's ace, he's just got a record deal in Germany too so Watch Out Music Fans.  Tomorrow I think we shall have less pictorial foolerly and instead one of those Guide To Life thingies I used to do an age ago.  I'll have a ponder.

       &nbsp; A day late, but here she is!&nbsp; This week's  Guest Cat  is Socks, who was adopted&nbsp;from the RSPCA with her (late) sister Schmig and lives with Popt_art.&nbsp; Since Schmig's untimely end, Socks (previously somewhat cocky and aloof) has taken on all the nicest traits of her sister. She purrs, sleeps on people's beds and even answers when spoken to.&nbsp; She loves nature and has befriended in her time squirrels and foxes, but is less than enamoured with next doors cross-eyed longhaired cat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts on the subject of World Domination you can probably guess.    ...and is it just me, or does she have a look of  urlLink Paris Hilton  about her?

Please note, Guest Cat this week should be up tomorrow - bear with me.

      Just a wee thing today:  urlLink The Portfolio of Artist Steph Dix , who looks like a jolly nice lady and can draw some really cracking pussycats.   Hooray for her!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have a suspicion she also does the "roll up, roll up" strip in the Guardian too, but I can't be sure and I can't find a linky.

        What am I like?  I completely forgot about this yesterday - although not one of YOU lot reminded me, I notice.  Today's  GUEST CAT  is Millie, who, like last week's guest Isaac, lives with Lemoncurry and Winston the Rabbit.    Millie is a British Blue shorthair and a real snob, sauntering up and down as if she owns the place.  She can't be doing with children and hides from most visitors. Her favourite food is cooked chicken (leg - off the bone).  She likes to roll over with her mum and dad and pretend to be a teddy bear.  She's not very vocal, but when she does speak, she's very loud and bossy.  Her favourite TV show is River Cottage with Hugh Fearlessly-Eatsitall.   ...well, there's a cat after my own heart, I must say!  I'm sure we all wish her luck in her plans for World Domination.

      This weekend I went to  urlLink a very clever exhibition , and jolly good it was too.  If you are not in London, my heart goes out to you.  But you could always go to  urlLink this beautiful place , which I visted recently too.  They're quite good at greenery in Yorkshire.  If little else.

       CONGRATULATIONS TO MR BOVINE  - he has a fancy new job as an animator for a clever website (not sure if I'm allowed to say whose) and he is GREAT.  See,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here.     And now on to the business of the day.        IN SECOND PLACE:  The answer to an important question...  urlLink Where can you see Lions?   Weebl is a very talented chappy who made those jolly Wobbl & Bob cartoons on MTV, as well as the infamous "badger badger badger badger" viral and many other peculiar things.  He likes Japanese food and is quite shy until you get him a bit tiddled. Have a look around his site - there's a really clever hiphop spider and a lovely Christmas song in there somewhere.

           ...I hope you hadn't forgotten our theme for the next three days?  Jolly good.   IN THIRD PLACE :  urlLink The Orky Puppy Page!  (also includes kittens)    A more sophisticated version is here:  urlLink Orktastic  but it's animated so you can't stop and go "aaawwwwwwwwww!" quite as effectively.

         Today's  GUEST CAT  is Isaac, who lives with Lemoncurry the human, Millie the Cat and Winston the Rabbit.  Here he is in his bath, which as you can see he does not mind a bit.  Lemoncurry says:  "...he does have a naughty habbit of knocking EVERY glass over he can find to see what is in it.  He also likes to 'investigate' the neighbourhood - he goes out with us on a lead as hes a house cat - but is very naive about the 'outside' world - and consequently tries to talk to ANY other animals - big or small."   He is also very loyal and loving, which I imagine makes a good cover for his plans for World Domination.  What an appallingly cute animal he is.  It quite brings a tear to the eye.    Tune in again tomorrow, when I shall commence this useful three-part series:

      Now, I don't know how many of my lady readers out there are midnight of hair and moonlit of complexion, like me, but if you are: may I say you need to get your hands on some of  urlLink THIS.    I finally got around to chemically dissolving my moustache* last night and this morning, by God, I look all young and fresh and jolly in an indefinable yet significant sort of way.  * Don't lie, I know you have one too.

      It's Friday at last, so tonight I expect you all to get your gladrags on and go out and party.  Wave your hands in the ayer, etc.  This guy's already waiting for you, so hurry up if you want to catch him before he's had one too many - they serve the martinis very strong at that place...

      I don't know if you have heard of the fillums of  urlLink Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli) , but let me tell you they are ace, and don't be put off because they're furrin.  There was a recent release of  urlLink Spirited Away  in a rather well-dubbed version which was at cinemas, so you might've seen that, or heard of I think their 2nd most famous one,  urlLink My Neighbour Totoro  which starts off a little annoying and winds up BEYOND peculiar - it has a catbus and all sorts.    Both of these are complex, beautiful films that knock spots off most Disney output, and I really do urge you to seek 'em out.  Boys will like them too. But the one I was going to mention today was  urlLink Laputa, Castle in the Sky  which is a bit steampunk, and had moderately famous Americans to do the voiceovers.  The oddest bit about watching this film though was that the  urlLink Evil General Muska  is the very image of my  urlLink ex , except without the homicidal manic tendencies.  No, honest.

         ARRGH!  AAAARRRGH!!  AAAAAARRRRGH!!!   It's all going utterly pear-shaped around here...  There was no post on Friday, I promised MissPrism a Trouble photoshop that never materialised, and worst of all: I've lost her web page somehow so I can't get all the info on Morgan that she deserves.  However, from memory:  This week's  GUEST CAT  is Morgan.  She is Trouble's sister, a little smaller and better behaved.  Morgan likes killing her mousie and being groomed and cuddled.  Her plans for the future include World Domination and not falling off the balcony, and she has mastered the exquisitely distainful Cat Face very early, as you can see:    I am really sorry for all the disruption, and I'm afraid it's not going to get better soon, either, as I'm on holiday from the end of this week.  Please keep us on your bookmarks, normal service will be resumed before the end of the month.
