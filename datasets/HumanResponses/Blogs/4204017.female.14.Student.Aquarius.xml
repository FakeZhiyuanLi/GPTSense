Me and Lowmo snuck into Hi-D's basement and stayed there in the dark until Joanne and Gordie went to bed..haha it was super fun. I love those girls with all my heart.

        puffy painting shirts is the shit!          Yesterday and the day before Erin n Hayl came over and we puffy painted. Randomly Hayl gets out this old box of Barbies and we had a blast! haha we are so crazy!           Later we were going to Reids (cuz of Erin) and he was eating so we decided we were going to Chris's and we didn't wanna walk all the way around so we cut up through this huge ass hill and almost died! We got to Chris's house and he thought we were drunk. lol we weren't i swear.           Then we met up with Reider and layed on my trampoline for a while. Then Reid and Erin went "on a walk" came back to my house, while me and hayls were doing our james bond shit trying to find them.. well i wont say what happened next, but AFTER that, we watched Butterfly Effect with susan, jessica, and griffin..which is ssssscuuuurry as hell!           Pretty good night though..          much lovin     Syda*

       bad/good night last night..      Reid causes problems..and uses girls to get some..   Anyways..I thought John was sweet..and I don't think he was the one talking on Reid's sn most of the time. And I think the only reason he broke up with Heidi is because of Reid. Anyways so after I got home from Heidi's last night, I made a deal, and didn't see my shooting star so that kinda freaked me out..but Hayls and Heid helped me out and calmed me down lol..it was good. I love those girls.      ahh.. summer's almost over! How sad :-( Let's make the best of these last few weeks.. hehe      *Love ya               Syda*
