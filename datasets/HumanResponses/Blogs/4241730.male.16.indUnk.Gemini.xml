        I did. That's why I told you. I finished that story... I'm going to Calgary tomorrow! YAY! Doubt I'll get ahold of a computer to update this. Doubt anybody reading this is really concerned. I like cheese.    Mood:   Excited! This color looks exciting, right?

          You know, I've always wondered that. I suspect it has something to with the fact that it only means raspberry-flavoured when it's artificially manufactured. When it is produced, it comes out a really cool-looking blue color. Why change a good thing?  Anyways.  I started writing that story today...  It's not too long, maybe I'll finish tonight.  Hm.  Whatever whatever.    Mood:   Creative

       Because I don't have enough to do, I'm writing here again. I'm hungry and I want supper but mom is still sleeping and dad isn't home. I want to go to Calgary... I'm going 8:30 AM on Tuesday. I wrote a story today. Well, I didn't actually *write* it, I just thought of it. Every sentence, every detail... Every punctuation mark. It's been three hours and I haven't forgotten it. I should really write it down, hey? I've been wasting time playing games on  urlLink Homestar ... I'm trying to get all 150 points in Peasant's Quest but failing spectacularly. My cousin claims he killed Trogdor. I do not believe him. I think my favorite game on that website is Population Tire. It's fun. I can win at that one. I'm gonna go do something.

        Okay, so I've started this blog because I don't have enough to do. I don't think my font changed. Grr. There we go now. Happy happy. As I was saying, I lack a life, along with many other things. So here I am, writing about nothing... Tum dee dum. I love to write, so despite the fact that it's highly unlikely anyone is going to read this, it'll at least give me a chance to do something with my writing skills. If nothing else, I can at least do that. Hm. Something that I really love is to browse the internet looking for ways to kill time. I have discovered, unsurprisingly, that there are very few ways to kill time on the internet. Javanoid slowly drives you insane over time, eventually you'll finish reading all the  urlLink Sluggy  comics, and the  urlLink Penny Arcade  comics, and then you're left with what? Well, there's  urlLink Maddox , which can be really funny sometimes... But even that you'll finish. Or you'll be insulted by one or more of the articles. The guy doesn't like blogs, yet I mention him in mine. Hm. Eh. Whatever. Moving right along... Uh... Sort of... Lost my train of thought here. Whatever. I'll post ... sometime.
