      I went to two open mics in New York City today.  The first was at the New York Comedy Club.  I did 5 minutes in front of 5 people.  It made my soul weep.  I didn't even do too badly, but the sadness I felt emanating from the other comics in that shoebox of a room was almost unbearable.  Good thing I got drunk later on in the night.  Then I did 5 minutes in front of about 10 people at a place called the village lantern.  Not as depressing, enjoyable almost, except for the fact that not every comic did a joke about how many gay people live in the village.  That would have made the night even more filled with giggles.  Good thing I got drunk later on in the night.  I finished off my day by going to see a late show at the Comedy Cellar.  Jim Norton and Dov Davidoff were funny, but that was about it.  Sitting in that club seeing how the audience almost lost their fucking minds laughing and applauding for jokes ranging from "Did you ever notice that titties..." to "The thing about titties is..." made me want to kill everyone around me and then show up at the presinct to admit that I did it.  Good thing I'm drunk right now.

      If you are a ruling body, the best way to convince the general public that you’re devoted to increasing their happiness, wellbeing and strength of voice is to identify the problem that you intentionally created for them (a problem that you are continuing to support), rebuke them for falling to this shameful level of behavior in response, and offer a completely acceptable (to your own interests) remedy for such actions.  That’s why we hear so much about voter apathy and indifference in the United States and how horrible it is that people don’t exercise their right to have a say in political affairs.  Once this sorry situation has been identified, media, business and the like begin a campaign to motivate the population to head for the polls as often as possible so as to support one or another candidate that is acceptable to the current power establishment.  As long as you are “involved” in the system in this way, you will be encouraged to believe that you are fulfilling your duty to your country, yourself and your fellow man by expressing your ideas and opinions about which self proclaimed intelligent and capable person that represents the same basic interests should be in charge of directing policy.  However, if one were to be so crazy as to seek organization outside of the major political organizations and attempt to have more direct control over the decisions that shape his or her life, control that might undermine elite domination, one would discover that the flood of encouragement quickly diminishes and eventually devolves into pressure aimed at forcing a return to the previously prescribed modes of behavior.  The illusion of participation through ballot casting is meant to coax the citizenry into perceiving that they do influence the direction that they and their nation are moving in meaningful ways, through nothing more than choosing between nearly identical (more or less) white, wealthy males who obviously don’t conduct their business with the general good in mind.  This mirage is strengthened in no small part by lack of discussion in any mainstream arena addressing possible alternatives for public influence on governmental activity.

      I've been watching more and more television lately since my teaching job ended on the 16th.  I've been getting fatter, more angry at journalism and more sure that I really like Che Guevera.  So my friend helped me to start a blog.  I thought it would give me something to do that would make me fatter and increase my love of Che, but at the same time keep me away from the news.  So far, so good.  Thanks.

      I am trying to make this weblog live and not be inanimate.  If this works, we will have not done anything worth while.

      I did a set at Porky's tonight, my friend Jamie Kilstein got me a job.  I liked it a lot, it was a challenge.  I did like 10 minutes and did much better than I supposed I would.  I performed in front of like 15 people and 5 comics, which aren't really people anyway.  I got a good reaction and realized that it wasn't just because of the way I have altered the words I use, but more due to the delivery.  I am learning about how to do comedy more and more every day, and am, for the first time, proud of what I am doing as a comic.  So come check me out at the Stress Factory on Church Street in New Brunswick every Wednesday night at 8:00.  It's an open mic, but it is only 5$, so fucking come.  Thanks.

      Well, I have a blog that I don't think anyone has read.  But, as I have said before, I am doing this for myself as much as for an audience.  I have problems.  But so do you.  I just get off on admitting it and trying to deal.  You enjoy, well, not "enjoy", but you survive by supressing all of the negative things you run through your mind, or that your mind runs through you, because you are even more afraid than I am.  Every time I collapse into a horrible, self-identifying, esteem problem riddled mindset, I remember you.  And I don't feel better, I just feel welcomed.

      I love everyone, and no I am not on ecstacy.  But, I must add to that thought, I hate everyone as well.  I love what I believe to be slumbering inside all human beings, but detest what they do with it.  I know many people who have realized that they are intelligent.  I believe that I am as well.  But most of the folks that have noticed that they have more knowledge of the world around them want to use that knowledge to force others to agree with them.  I think that it would be better to lift the fetters that those people place on others and allow them to make decisions on their own.  But that is why I will never do anything with my time on this plane.  I'll keep trying, because I am a masochist.  I think I will not even make a dent, but at least I am not filled only with hate...I have love as well.  Fuck you.

      I've been watching the incorporation of Edwards into the new Democartic machine today.  And I see whay they did it, especially over Hillary Clinton.  There were rumors around that indicated that Hillary was a contender for VP.  But she had a vagina, so she was out.  If she had a penis, we might have had Kerry/Clinton.  I have the opinion that everyone that a person likes in politics employs the same methods and has many of the same flaws as a person that they hate.  So for all of the deomcrats that hate Bush, and I hate him too, but for all those dems, the people that they preach about and think have a new voice and direction for America, they suck too.  I personally believe, and this is backed up through conversations with many people involved in politics, I believe that if you aren't a bigwig but still back a candidate, you are doing it for one or more of the following 3 reasons.  Reason number 1; you're looking for power.  If you want to enter the system and have enough intelligence/determination/lack of human companionship, then you'll back someone and be a good lapdog.  If that person is victorious, you're home free.  Second reason, you are a person that can never succeed like they can, and want to be a part of their comet.  Most people that I have met involved with political campaigns could never be what they will always hope to be, which is someone in a dominant position.  Sure, they can dominate any subordinates they are lucky enough to watch over, but that's it.  Charismatic and strong people run for office and those who can never do the same support them.  Last reason, these people truly believe that the person they are backing is a good man/woman (but who are we kidding), and that their support will  make the world a better place.  Only problem is that the world will never become a better place when the only way to jump into the ultimate power seat is to make everyone like you through mistruths and manipulation.  God Bless America.

      I believe that sex is one of the most basic impulses we have, and unfortunately one of the most difficult to deal with in the modern world, depending on where you live.  Here in the US it is repressed, even in the most sexually free people.  Women seem to be even more into it than men, but the trick is bringing it out in them. I used to say that I wish people would have more orgies, but now that I realize that many attractive people do, I just want Vanessa and I to be invited.  At least I have dreams.

      Hey.  I'm drunk.  I am glad I have this place to write when I am drunk that other people might see when I don't have to actually show them.  So how about the news.  Doesn't it make you want to eat lye?  I read the beginning of O'Reilly's book tonight while I was smoking.  He says that if you drink a lot or smoke crack (because they are the same things) that you shouldn't have his book.  He actually says, although jokingly, that if you are in any of the preceeding categories you probably stole the book and should give it back.  I have done lots of acid, and I am reading his book.  And I watch his show every night, although I make sure not to buy any of the products advertised during the broadcast so that the purpose of the show doesn't snatch me.  I don't know whether or not he actually believes what he says.  I don't know what is worse.  It's the same way I feel when I listen to preachers on TV at 2 am.  I am not sure what is more reprehensible, believing in greedy nonsense or pretending to so you can make a buck or get some fame.  Oh well.
