      **hMmm... i've made this last yr pa ata.. hehe... its fo' MY BOO....  Once in my life, God gave me one person who taght me "MY GR8ST LESSON". One person i can't live without. One person i call my own. One person i've loved the most. The person who taught me to face reality and to live with it, who accepted and loved me for who i am, who taught me to be honest and to be real to my self, who've cared me the most and who've loved me the most.  Thanks for bringging out the best in me. Thanks for helping me to realize things and to face this real world. Thanks for helping me to overcome my fears, for letting me experience things that helped me to discover the real me. Thanks for your support, for your guidance and your LOBE.  Things might not go in our way. I promise to stay by your side. i'll be here for you. i'm ready to wipe your tears dry and to comfort you. i'll be with you thru joys and even your darkest days..

      *mMMMmm.... i've written this for MY ONE AND ONLY ENG!!!... errr... one person, who've touched my life deeply. arggghhh.... one person i can't live without... hMMM.... just read it..   I’ve broken your heart into pieces..  I’ve caused you so much pain  Tears had fallen from your eyes…  Sadness is what you felt…   I left your love behind  To test your love for me..  I tried to get you out of my mind  To prove myself I was “OVER YOU”..   Still in my heart  Can’t hardly move on…  These feelings so strong  Can’t barely forget…  I tried to pretend  I tried to hide  I tried to deny  What I feel inside..   Memries haunts me…  missing you makes me ill  Thinking of you …  Drives me insane…   AND NOW THAT… YOUR BACK…  You’ve proved to me  That your love is true..  Now I can see..   I’m ready to take this chance again  Hope your love is not slain  I love you with all of mine  Never get out of my sight   Hold on as we walk together  In this journey that would last forever..  This hands will be locked on yours..  Through joys and sorrows…   I’m yours alone  And promise to give all of me  Till this last breath of mine  Will be offered to you…

      *errr.. i've wroted this one nung feeling ku, hindi na sya ung dating kilala ku... but its fyn... kc somehow i've seen her effort to bring back the old one.*   There’s no permanent thing in this world. Let’s just face reality and accept the truth that everything changes. We people encounter a lot of changes in us. It may either be the changes in our personality, in our being, in our body, in our environment or the people around us. Some changes occur fleetly, it’s like a flash without knowing that it suddenly happened and some changes occur sluggish, it’s as slow as a swamp turtle. These are just normal things that happen to us… and it’s really hard dealing with it. It might cause a bad or a good outcome. But the best way to deal with it is to accept these changes.   I do believe people change. Some people change for the better… for the best… and sometimes to make things worst. I’ve been facing a lot a changes happening to my life. I myself, admits that I’ve changed!!! I knew I was greatly influenced with the experiences I’m going through. Maybe some people might have noticed that changes in me. Maybe, it indeed evokes a good out come. Or maybe it evokes a bad one. I may not know the answer, but I, myself know that I am truly happy with the new being I am. There were also changes with the people that surround me. At first it was hard for me to admit and to face a lot of things happening in my life. I’ve encountered a lot of problems in my own home. I grieve. I cried. I felt really down. But nothing happened. The problem still haunts me. And so the best thing I did was to engage myself with this world and learn to adjust. I even encounter “culture shocks” that made me realize that this person have changed a lot!!! And I just can’t believe how that person was so indifferent from being the “old” one before. I never knew how that happened…. And how it suddenly occurs??!!! Really surprising isn’t it?… but we’ve got nothing to do but to accept it!!! That’s Life and we should just go with the flow. Though sometimes these changes hurts us. Lets just learn to ACCEPT and to ACCOMODATE with it…Ü

       *haha,, i've forgotten the time i've written this. i was inspired actually. haha. bear with me if it's too corneee...*     Life has been great. I’ve been battling through a lot of sacrifices that made my life even more challenging to live. God gave me so many reasons to continue and to love my life. He had taught me a lot from these life experiences. I’ve learned new wonderful yet very challenging things, which helped me to know myself better. God even gave me back one person I wish for. He gave me the chance to experience and learn the meaning of TRUE LOVE. I’ve learned to face reality, to express myself, to fight in what I believe in and to show my true feelings. “Denying my feelings and myself” were some of the things I’m tired of doing and promised to leave behind. Now I’m living my life with the saying.  “BE REAL AND BE YOURSELF!!!”  I’m simply enjoying this life and really excited to face more trials that could fortify to be a stronger person that I am. I’ll strive hard to be a survivor in this world. I’ll never give things up just easily. I’m happy with this life and promise to live with it!… But if u don’t want to believe all this stuffs I’m sayin’.. SO BE IT!!!…Ü
