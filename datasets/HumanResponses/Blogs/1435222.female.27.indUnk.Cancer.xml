         I've tasted the best spam of my life this morning, with mixed vegetables and buttered hot rice. I've been eating spam since birth but today was different. Is there such a thing as spam from heaven? Coz I'm the luckiest to have experienced it!  Tomorrow marks the 2nd month of a new and promising team.  The team consists of two beautiful, crazy, "not-so-ordinary individuals" with unique characteristics complementing each other. Each day is a discovery of new things about one another and it's so amazing that you're not afraid to share each other's dreams, thoughts, feelings, fears, hopes, goals and what-have-you's because you know that partners stick together.  I had the Best Spam this morning because it was prepared by someone who was already sleepy, ready to take a rest because of back pains, droopy eyes shut because of hours playing in front of his PC commanding his troops in the war; and in spite of the magnet from his bed, he stood up and made our first "home/condo-made" breakfast on our 2nd month of partnership.

      My friends and I were spending the sunday afternoon sound tripping.  I started with my 70's retrospect CD and we were all eager to name the title of the song and sing the lyrics that we were familiar with, mostly the chorus part. I belted out Angela Bofill's "If I Believe". I've always loved that song but never really paid attention to the lyrics because I was crossing the borderline of cynicism. But it's different now. I wanted to sing because I wanted to serenade him. Yes, "my special sauce" was right in front of me, staring and smiling at me, and teasing me to stop coz he might fall in love with me even more. Stubborn me, I finished the whole song, performance level at that. So there I was, sitting on the floor, with my legs crossed, a singer and deejay-wannabe in her undies. They joined me in my "concert".  We belted out, we reminisced, we had fun. Four makati young urbanites spending a lazy sunday afternoon at the condo with packs of cigarette, COKE, chips and my KFC brownies.   He asked me to stand up and dance with him while the song "Hold Me" was being played. We hugged while we danced, and I felt secure with the silence.  No words were spoken. He looked at me straight in my eyes, ran his fingers through my face, and told me three words.  Three words that were music not only to my ears, but to my life. We hugged each other tight, we cried, we said our piece, we expressed our fears, we opened up our hearts, we gave ourselves a chance to work as a team to a commitment of the union of two souls. I would never forget that song. I probably had him with the senti songs, but it was unintentional.  I would never forget that moment. It was OUR MOMENT. And it is PRICELESS.  The lazy sunday afternoon turned out to be the happiest day of my life. I felt serenity within. He's a happy man, that's his song for me; and I am a happy woman who promises not to betray his trust in me.     "Hold Me"    I hold you, I touch you  Make you my woman  I'll give you my love  With sweet surrender  Tonight our hearts will beat as one  And I'll hold you, I'll touch you  Make you my woman tonight   There's something in your eyes I see  A pure and simple honesty   Chorus:  Hold me in your arms tonight  Fill my life with pleasure  Let's not waste this precious time  This moment's ours to treasure  Hold me in your arms tonight  We'll make it last forever  When the morning sun appears  We'll find our way together   I believe you  When you say that you love me  Know that I won't take you for granted  Tonight the magic has begun  So won't you hold me touch me  Make me a woman tonight   There's something in your eyes I see  I won't betray your trust in me       "Happy Man"   Merely by chance  Very unsuspecting  You caught my heart  Unprotecting me  Now I've fallen in love with you   Just when I thought  Life was free and easy  You came along to me  Soft and breezy  Now I've fallen in love with you   And for the first time in my life  I know what it's like to be a happy man  Happy man  And for the first time in my life  You've given me something I can't understand  Now that I'm a happy man   Be with me now  Love me forever  Leaving you lady  Is something that I'd never do  I've fallen in love with you   All of my life it seems I have waited  Now I can say all these words I have stated are true  I've fallen in love with you  I've fallen in love with you

        Have you ever said to yourself, "I wish this day would never end."  Then you begin to form a heartfelt smile in your face and with your two eyes closed, the scenes keep playing in your mind over and over again.  You managed to keep photographic memories of the faces and mental notes of the conversations.  Then you take a deep breath and wish that it never ended.  You embrace the moment; you hold on to it, you nurture it.   May 2 .  I never thought that this day would be historical.  I didn't have any idea AT ALL.  In fact, I was a walking zombie that day because I moved in to my new condo the previous day.  Imagine coming from a 9-hour work shift Friday night, then going home to QC Saturday morning to get my stuff then back to Makati to buy some groceries and unpack things at my new condo.  I probably had two hours of sleep.  I forced myself to de-magnetize my frail body from our new queen-sized bed, covered with baby pink mattress.  I lazily prepared for our office dinner because I had to.  After a few hours of chitchatting with familiar faces at work, and feeling bored with the same person joining the videoke contest, we decided to go to the event.  Little did I know that this event would be "THE EVENT" of my frozen, almost-dead love life!  Even the great astrologers and famous psychic readers wouldn't have prophesized what transpired during the first hours of the morning of the second of May in the year 2004.  I don't know if I have to be grateful to the one who invented the truth pill because I found out later on that it was all planned-out.  How would you feel if the person that you're in love with looks into your eyes and actually tells you "I LOVE YOU", not only once, but a lot of times?  And that you were actually in denial for quite some time, you gathered all your energies to suppress what you're feeling and the more that you do, that's when you find yourself doing things out of the ordinary which you don't normally do to someone that you just like.  You keep convincing yourself to just go with the flow, and if you get hurt for the nth time, then life sucks.  You never planned on admitting to him that you've fallen in love because you were a certified "A.D.S." So, after all the mind-boggling discussions with your friends and the million questions juggling in your head, there he was saying the words you didn't expect to hear! It felt like everything freeze, and all you can see is his face with the three words coming out of his mouth, and you even can't hear anything, but you know that these three words are all that matters.   June 2.   It was the first month of my resurrected love life.  I asked him to have lunch with me at my condo.  I prepared our favorite "kaldereta" from jolly box and asked him to go inside the bathroom.  Ok, I pushed him to go there.  All along he thought that I wanted him to wash his feet but I didn't say a word.  I closed the bathroom door when he was already inside.  He didn't know that he was in for a surprise!  There he saw a blue paper bag.  Inside this cute paper bag are two cute teddy bears hugging each other (an epitome of how we started) with an orange-colored flower balloon tucked between them.  And there are tiny long sheets of paper rolled and glued to the balloon stick with notes of what I like and love about him.  I opened the bathroom door for him to come out.  I let him read the little notes and watched him like a little kid who just got his favorite Christmas present.  He walked towards me and gave me a big hug.  I guess we were just hugging for an hour.  He was speechless and I was, too.  He felt very appreciated and loved, because I sincerely do love him and that's final.   June 20 . It was a typical Sunday afternoon for four Makati Young Urbanites (MYU) situated in unit 705-E. We had a simple life cycle - eat, have a cig, watch DVD, bathroom time, and just like a round song, it goes on and on.  No need to dress up to go to the mall to watch movies or go window-shopping.  We enjoyed hanging out at our "crib-like" condo unit with just a pair of shirts and shorts/PJs.  Just for a change, I insisted on playing my "senti" cd's. I can't even remember the last time I listened to those types of songs.  I brought it to the condo just for the sake of bringing all my personal belongings and now I'm glad I did.  Remember, I became a "cynic" after a lot of rotten relationships.  Anyways, I posed a challenge to the MYUs to guess the title of the song starting from 70's era.  I was impressed that they did not only know the song, but even sang along with the artist.  I was in the mood as well so when Angela Bofill started to belt out, that didn't stop me.  I sang "If I Believe" and looked at him the whole time.  He was telling me to stop because I was earning "ganda points".  Of course I didn't listen to him because I felt the lyrics running through my veins.  Then there was this song, "Happy Man" and he asked me to listen to it; this was his song for me. It was beginning to get dark (my signal to prepare for my 8pm shift at work) when he asked me to stand up and dance with him.  I was not much of a dancer, but who cares?  We danced slowly to the duet of Whitney Houston and Teddy Pendergrass' "Hold Me".  We were just dancing and hugging all at the same time, embracing the comfort of the silence between us when he suddenly whispered to my ears, "I CHOOSE YOU."  I cried.  I cried because I was happy and I've never felt that kind of feeling before and I know that it was a tough decision for him. I told him that "We're a team now," and he cried and poured out all his fears to me.  I never thought that June 20 was D-DAY because I never pressured him or gave him a time limit.  We were crying, dancing, hugging, and listening to the song that kept reverberating through our hearts.  June 20 became my birthday, my Christmas and new year's day.  I was floating.  Until now, I couldn't find the words to describe the inner happiness that I felt with him.  I wouldn't trade that moment for anything else.  Remember the scene in the movie, "City of Angels" when Meg Ryan was riding in her bicycle, her eyes closed and arms wide open to breathe the fresh air of her new life with Nicolas Cage?  I was smarter though.  I didn't close my eyes while I walked towards the office because I have just been resurrected!   July 4 .  My 27th birthday.  I went home the day before to prepare lasagna for the MYUs.  For the first time in my life, my mom is not throwing a party, my friends didn't plan a surprise for me, and I decided to break the tradition.  Enough of the overflowing alcohol and intoxicated friends.  I wanted my 27th birthday to be simple.  So I headed towards his condo after preparing the lasagna and played SIMS while he was sleeping.  His cozy bed is so dear to me that the mere sight of it causes a magnetic force for me to lie down, that we both fell asleep.  My smart body clock woke me up at around eleven, an hour before my birthday.  The other MYUs were at the condo already, going crazy over hunger pangs and impatiently waiting for us, or was it the super cheesy lasagna that they really looked forward to? I had a hard time waking him up (as usual) that we almost got into a petty fight.  But since it was my birthday and he was the one with the lack of sleep, I didn't allow our moods to clash.  Not on the eve of my birthday.  He then realized what went wrong and gave his apology with a big hug, which I sweetly accepted.  By 12 midnight, we were at my condo with the rest of the other MYUs joining me in welcoming the 27th year of my life.  They loved my lasagna and I love them for being with me.  Simple gestures make me a happy cucumber!  We bought wine to go with the lasagna while he had tobacco and acted like one of the characters in the "mafia-inspired movies". He is so damn animated that he makes me fall in love even more.  We watched DVD and since we were both very tired and sleepy, we called it a day.  Did you know that sleeping with his arms wrapped around me and seeing his face before I go to sleep and waking up to see his face the minute I open my eyes is one of my treasured moments?  I just love watching him when he's asleep with his bochog cheeks pressed against my baby pink pillow.  He is so beautiful!  I checked my phone and replied to my birthday messages and returned all the calls that I missed.  When he was already awake, I kissed him "good morning" and said, "I love you baby!"  I sweetly told him that I had to do something for that day.  I want to attend the mass.  He quickly replied, "Okay, let's go hear mass."  He hasn't heard mass for quite some time now and I didn't even force him to go with me that's why I'm so thankful for that immeasurable gift!  We had coffee after the "special  mass" and when we got back to the condo, the other MYUs were asleep and we didn't want to wake them up so we just stayed at the balcony.  We were there for a couple of hours with my starbucks white mocha frap and his starbucks iced tea which I later refilled and we had the best conversation! We have a "brutal honesty" rule where we tell each other the 100% truth unlike other couples who stay in a relationship withholding information from one another.  There was so much love overflowing, with the blanket of the night sky and city lights coming from the tall buildings and just "US" talking about our goals and building our dreams together.  I had to admit that an added spice was when he called up his best friend and their "mommy" in the barkada just to share with them how happy we are and he even let me have a chat with them.  And their words were music to my ears, like a choir of angels singing in heaven telling me how much their friend loves me so much.  And I do, too!   July 10 .  It was our first "formal" date.  Let me tell you that we are not a normal couple.  We don't go out every weekend to watch a movie, eat out, drink at a bar.  We just don't like to fit into a norm.  July 10 was different though. I was wearing this moss green tube dress with a moss green knitted unbuttoned sweater with my killer stiletto heels while he was in his neatly ironed blue polo and black slacks and shiny black shoes.  We were going to watch a classical concert featuring a Japanese pianist and flutist with a Filipino clarinet artist as their guest.  We were just in time and we seated ourselves at the back of the auditorium.  We held hands while we listened to the music that the instruments magically produced.  After the concert, I dared him to approach Philippe, president of the French association he met during a French graphic design exhibit a couple of days ago.  With perfect timing, we went to Philippe and he introduced himself again, thanked him for the concert tickets and introduced me as his girlfriend.  Oh, what a wonderful moment to behold!  We were planning to walk home since the condo is just a few blocks away, and the night was still young when my college friend called me up and forced us to meet up with them at one of the posh Italian restaurants.  Since there were still complications that have yet to be ironed out, I didn't force him.  But I guess he felt challenged when he read the text message of my friend.  He then said, "Hamunin na naten ang mundo!"  So we went there and he met my four bisexual male friends and he carried himself pretty well.  The crazy birthday girl arrived afterwards and he enjoyed their company even more.  They asked him questions, which he truthfully answered and he made me feel like the "Miss Universe" in a beauty pageant.  The birthday girl even volunteered to give me her bouquet of flowers to complete the setting.  And in spite of the danger of the possibility of other people who might see us, he held my hand, and placed both our hands at the top of the table.  It felt so damn good!  They even took a picture of us and sent it to my phone (thanks to MMS) and honestly, we look good together.  I later found out that they talked about us after we left and all agreed that we seem to be happy together.  And we really are.   July 24, 25, 26 .  It was the 2nd birthday of my godchild and I asked him to come with me.  I was wearing my favorite black blouse over my black skirt with little prints of baby pink and violet flowers and paired the attire with my ever-reliable "grrr" black sandals.  He was wearing his black polo shirt tucked in his blue jeans with his black leather shoes.  We were walking at the back lobby of the office after finishing one cig when one of our partee friends gave a remark, "Wow, couple of the new millennium!"  We were both shocked because we didn't tell her. Oh well...           So we went to the children's party and my friend's first question to him was, "So, baket?"  Yes, they grilled me (as usual) and grilled me even more which stirred up his paranoia.  Our former American boss was having a "war/military/combat" conversation with the fiancé of my friend and he just listened to them, nodded and once in a while joined their company.  My former boss was an ex-marine corps and since he is into great wars, he probably enjoyed their "guy talk" while we girls talked about the forthcoming wedding of my friend.  I loved eating the birthday cake but what I loved the most is the fact that my friends like him and they're sincerely happy for us.  Finally, their friend (yes, that's me!) has come to her senses, learned from her past mistakes and is now ready to handle an honest-to-goodness relationship which would grow and flourish for a long time...hopefully, f-o-r-e-v-e-r.  We went back to his condo after the children's party and he bombarded me with questions I never heard from my past boyfriends.  Since brutal honesty rules, I answered them all.  And we had one of the most wonderful "moments" thereafter.  We slept for a while until it was time to prepare and meet up with his friends this time.  His roommate and the girlfriend arrived before we left.  I opened the door since he was still lying on his bed so dear to me and he introduced me to his roommate's girlfriend.  I was amazed at her comment when she said, "Finally!"  That word seemed like a bomb exploding my system.  It turned out that his best friend (who happens to be the older brother of his roommate's girlfriend) told her stories about how in love we are *grin*           So we met up with his best friend and the girlfriend plus their other friend and the girlfriend. We went to this bar where the antioch friends of his best friend play alternative rock the reggae way.  My hands and feet synchronized with the beating of the "box".  After that, the boys were planning to bring all the girlfriends home when he suddenly asked me if I was sleeping alone in the condo.  That was so sweet of him to even think about me even if they were supposed to have a "guy bonding" afterwards.  I was deeply touched by his act of kindness for me to just go with them at his best friend's house and he even asked me to bring clothes/book/blower for me to feel comfortable and not get bored.  These little gestures make my heart melt.            When we reached his best friend's house, I told him to close his eyes for his best friend's surprise.  I had known it for a couple of days now but I promised his best friend that I'd keep my mouth shut.  All the while he thought we were making fun of him.  He turned his back against us and his best friend got an ARTLINE sign pen and jokingly rubbed his butt! We all laughed when I told him to close his eyes again and this time, he'll get the real thing!  There it was, the Adobe Illustrator WOW CS his best friend gave him which would definitely help him develop his interest in graphic design. I love it every time my baby is happy!  After which, his best friend gave a presentation of their vision.  I listened, watched and learned a lot from them.  I'm very supportive of their dreams and I hope that they will soon "rule the world!"  After the business talk, we transferred to the sofa for more "bonding".  This time, it was his turn to be grilled by his friends.  I enjoyed teasing him because I know it was not true but he's so damn cute that I just hugged him in front of his friends.  We had breakfast when he asked, "Baby, you want coffee?"  Then I smiled, rolled my eyes and let his friends in to our little secret.  That when he wants to ask something from me, he'd say, "baby, you want iced tea?" when in fact he wants me to make iced tea for us! I also told them that he talks in his sleep and everytime I wake him up, he tells me things like he'll turn me into a plant so that he could bring the pot to his condo unit and I'd be there all the time!  And his best friend even added that he tells him that he feels like a king of the world when he hangs out at our condo because I fix everything for him already but when his best friend stayed at our condo one time, he saw us asking him to do some chores!  I had a good time with his friends!  On the way home, I told him that this is one of the days that I don't want to end because I became to know his friends and vice versa, and we discovered a lot of things about each other and I definitely enjoyed their company.  I felt that I belong.            We went back to his condo and his roommate and the girlfriend were still there when we arrived.  I changed my clothes and when I got out of the bathroom, his roommate's girlfriend said, "I was tempted to ask if you have clothes in here," to which he replied, "Yeah, she's got a pair of shorts" and I wanted to add a blouse, toothbrush, and some other stuff!  The girlfriend borrowed my favorite white tee embossed with a pink butterfly because she has to attend their family lunch.  The top is his favorite as well.  He likes it on me especially if I wear it with my super laid-back jeans and white sandals.  He was teasing me because his roommate's girlfriend is one of Philippine's 10 Best Dressed and she's going to wear our favorite butterfly tee.  After the left, we slept for fourteen hours and I could say that it was one of the best sleeps I've had, with him, in his bed so dear to me.  I could go on and on and tell you our moments or days which I don't want to end.  But, you see,  our love for each other...that's what I definitely would not like to end.
