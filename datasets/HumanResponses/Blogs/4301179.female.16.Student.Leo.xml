      there are so many people in the world. Some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice. Reality sucks and everyone knows it. If you want a meaning in life then you have to find it. But if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in it.Is there really a choice in what we want? Why do people hate? does anyone Know? I htink that people hate out of fear. Fear of change, fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same. Everyone wants what they cant have, unless they dont have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything. But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple, but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique, we have our own thoughts, thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things, and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes, and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection, therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize.

      Did you ever wonder why people care so much? or why anyone shows emotion? emotion is pain and happiness all in the same body emotions overwhelm people so much sometimes it seems unbearable. But then again its not like we can control what we feel. why do people get so angry if someone crys, its neither of there faults because they cant control there emotions. Today my little brother was playing with my feet and it irritates me so much and he just kept on asking me why. i have no idea why thats just how i feel, i dont like it. Can you explain why you feel the way you do about things?
