						   this is the first time I'm doing this because of sophia lee peipei... she's so convincing that I can destress myself here... if it does not; I will strangle her... actually it all started because we were having a discussion on how unhappy we are at work... then she told me about this blogging thing...  so I shall start by saying....... THAT I'M BEING UNAPPRECIATED!OVERWORKED!UNDERPAID! ALL OVER AGAIN!!!

						   Today was okay till some1 try to take what supposed to be mine. No matter how hard i try to get angry with the fella i cannot cos in the end i will pity the person and then try to reason myself by saying that i being too hard and too critical towards the person but again i always contradict,,, So difficult but i guess i will just have to give in this time and wait for my end contract. I do not blame the fella but i pity cos by doing that now she will win but later suffer her actions

						   Some i feel bad after i am angry but i really hate sneaky people they think i am dumb! I will play along to their pleasure but i will despise them. I gues i will just have to give in as much as i can to Lela she still young she dun know what it is like in the real working world. Sucking up too much will cause you blisters in the long run.. Or maybe i have to learn to suck up....Heeee

						   Dear Diary ( Or Sophia ), I am so angry with Lela, i dunno but i just feel that she can be a two headed snake. Always trying to outwin me. Ya i am her supervisor but i get no whatsoever information from her on work stuff but so eager to tell Shirley y? Maybe so she can get my position... I hate people who suck up to others shit  Sorry la just angry with her

But i mean everyone does mistakes even the braineiest ones wad....Anyway i accept the mistake. To hell with it in fact its not the end of the world  yet.  I just feel so bored at work i dunno if i waould want to continue here Sophia...I do not have to worry mush for DP team now cos Lela is here and she's the bossy type so can survive without me...
