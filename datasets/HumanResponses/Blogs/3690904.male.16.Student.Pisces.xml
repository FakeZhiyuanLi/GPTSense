						   Hey this is my first post so i hope i don't disapoint you, whoever you are found out about this site from a friend( http://lunchboxesblog.blogspot.com/ ) and thought the concept of a way to post your ideas and thoughts for free was alright so here i am typin'. well i guess i'll talk about today. well sleeped in till 11am. got up ate some waffels and went to get a card for my dad cause tommorow is Fathers Day (for all of those who forget that kind of stuff) then I went to work. by the way I work at McDonalds which is okay i suppose but anyway back to today. work was long , being as i worked from 2 - 8, but at least i enjoy the people there.ya Fluter came in for some food so i siad hi ( sup Flutes!!?? ) so anyways use backend people we're just chillin out making some burgers when Tristan starts fooling around with one of the ketchup dispensers and tries to flip it in the air,. Big Mistake!!. the tops of the dispensers aren't attached so it came off and out came the ketchup. so there we are looking at him and him back at us then, being the joker he is, he starts running back and forth quitely yelling "oh god i cut my self, it just won't stop squirting blood" and stuff like that. so during my 30 minute break i started chating with Tiffany, another fellow co-worker and by the way, not to displeasing to look at either but anyways that was ok. so after i got home and to a shower i tried to round up some people to do something but noone could do something. so i called evan and his dad said he left to meet some people at klein's so i grabbed my stuff and went to catch him at Klein's. so i meet him there with some others and i wanted to go to a movie but he couldn't so we went to St. Josaphat school and chilled out on the new shity aparatus. i still can't believe they replaced 'Old Woody'. so we lit a small fire and chilled out. then i got into some deep thought which i hope to use to write either a book or some songs. so we chilled and talked which was okay then we went our separate ways and thus here i am writing to whoevers listening. so whoevers listening thanks for reading bye.

						     When you feel down, feel like it's never going to be okay have you ever wondered why were here, What's the point? I know I have. it is hard to comprehend the complexity of ourselves let alone exsistence. So what are we to do? be lazy, only strole through life just barely making it from day to day. wondering when it's going to end. NO!!. We were ment to live for so much more. sometimes we just lose ourselves. sometimes the hardest thing to do is live. but when you do what you can, the best way you can, when you can there might still be hope for us.!!
