       Alright. I think I'm ready to leave my bloggie for a better use. I'm going to stop writing about my personal life, some bloke/lad/laddies whatever told me! Like I'm giving out too much about myself? Flaming hell, no!!! It was just a haphazard thoughts going inside my head! I can never write stuffs too personal even for my family to read! Well... I do it verbally, thank you. So... this is it! I'm blogging something else. hmm...*thinking*...as it turns out, if I do blog something else it might as well be footie! Nahh... too boring!!! As if we're not getting our high dosages of it already...but one thing for sure, I can't blog often now. So, to a new blog life come February! Say goodbye to my life's story!!! I'm keeping it a secret now. Zipped!!!!

       Such contrast the weather today compared to yesterday's snow fall. Today was sunny all day long. Didn't even put on my gloves, or scarf or snow cap!!! But had a hard time trying not to slip walking on the pavement. As it turned out, I was better off walking off the pavement and walk on the snow-filled grass beside the pavement. It wasn't a cool way trying to balanced myself on iced pavement which was quite slippery. Walking on pavement after snow fall felt like gliding on ice, if only I could glide!!!

       It's snowing heavily in the morn!!! thanks to my biological clock, I woke up at 9am. I looked out the window, hoping to see the ground covered in white. but no, there wasn't. then it came suddenly, right before my very eyes, the snow falling from the sky. It was so magical!!! I couldn't even believe my own eyes to actually see so much snow falling. I grew up in the tropics so seeing snow is like seeing diamonds falling out of the sky!!! I just can't contain my feelings. I went outside at noon when it snowed the most to take some pictures with my DV but it wasn't good. My DV was absolutely weathered in the snow! At this very moment, I regretted for not buying a weather proof olympus when I had the chance before I came here. My Mummy was so right! I should've listened to her and get that olympus!!! So now then...everybody should listen to their mummies, okies...  Well... I just hope that the weather would be alright tomorrow because I don't want to be walking in bad weather. Seriously, when it snowed here, it's a massive ice flakes storm...I couldn't even see properly in the snow. I've got wet hair and a sniffy nose just by standing under falling snow. I'm getting my gloves and scarf ready on my table. Else if I forget, I'll be a human popsicle!!! Ghastly, thought!!!

And then, more tedious jobs to resize them. Anyhow, here's one from my collections. I'm so proud of this one...the guts I have to show the world I'm popping pimples!!!   &nbsp; urlLink

       I've got to hand it to the man himself!!! Prof Mike is so cool!!! I love his lectures and he can be so funny... his lectures can never be boring! I definately love the way he conduct the lab today! He gave a good start for us before we started our practical. And my group was fantastic! I've got Carl, my good coursemate...I like being around him because he is so funny!!! So there was never a dull moment. Well... a good day today!

       I want to praise myself for sitting through a long day of lectures today, given the fact that today's weather was really bad. All foggy and cold, about  0 to -3 deg centigrade. Knew it was going to be cold but I managed to walk in the fog without much complain. Getting up was frustrating though because I'm still sleepy. Lectures was alright but need more readings on T-cells and B-cells, heavens...forgotten my immunolgy terms.   Gotta read up on practical biochemistry on spectrophotometry (not again!) colourimetric and NAD-Enzyme linked assays techniques for tomorrow's lab. So much to read but so little time!!!

       Oh, blast! Forgot to blog last night. Well, nothing much really. so, that's it huh, chinese new year festival came and went just like that. And all that blabbering about not getting my "angpows", uhm... I'm just abit depressed that's all. Will feel better after Mummy banks-in my "angpows", love my uncles and aunties!!! Thanks so much for the meaningful gestures eventhough I wasn't around to wish and serve tea!!! Well, being around me family, relatives and friends are better than receiving "angpows", distance taught me. Being away from home gives me freedom to perform they say but performing what? I am freedom when freedom allows me to perform and I can only perform when freedom comes unsought! Most stuffs I do now are very much rehearsed, all needed practicing like presentations, writing essays etc. It gets mundane sometimes. That's why I fancy spontaneity, although unorganised but no, practice is the method to perfection and that's what I have to do for now to better my future. Spontaneity will come in other forms. So, I shall wait and see...for that tall, dark and handsome...cripes, my mind is one heck of a mushy grey matter!

       After attending immunology lab in the early morn and spending hours in the library photocopying journals (bloody expensive photocopies!!!) in the afternoon, I took a nap immediately once I got home. I had my quick lunch too before collapsing onto my bed. I knew I was tired because it wasn't long before I was in dreamland.  After napping, I surfed the net because I really want to take a break from studying for the time being. Checked out some of the cool gibson's and taylor's acoustics. Ahh... how I wish I could get one of these babies, I know I would be practicing on them everyday. I mean, it's gibson's and taylor's man!!! I wouldn't even mind to bleed my fingers strumming on them. Why guitars? I wasn't sure myself, but I started to like acoustics sometime ago, even abandoned my piano already. Mummy thinks I'm extremely desirous, wanting more eventhough I've already got one guitar. But I really got sick of playing on a cheap guitar. Mine costs RM 200 but to my ears, it wasn't a solid one. Could it be an indication that I've passed the beginner level and it's time move on to another level. I love strumming but hate plucking. The only song I was able to pluck was The beatles "yesterday". It was my first song and I got to perform it during a guitar assemble concert during my final undergrad year. Thinking back, I missed my undergrad days, I did lots of crazy stuffs back then...

       Today is just like any other day. Walked in the rain this morning to physiology lab. Cold and wet, I didn't feel my hands and my cheeks or my ears. No feelings at all. I had rain water trickling down my face and my hair's somewhat messy due to the wind and rainwater, shouldn't have combed my hair this morn. Eventhough I was up and walking to lab from hall, I'm still very sleepy. I slept at 2am and woke up at 7am. That's 5 hours of sleep. was it a sleep at all? How much is enough sleep anyway? 8 hours, they say but most may not agree. Me too because I'm always feeling woozy especially in the late afternoons after readings. Nothing that interest me in the lab today. Did data analysis for the absorbancy measurement. While busy doing my calculations from Beer-Lambert formula, that cute smart Irish boy acknowledged my graph. I drew them raw and I have all my answers in it. He used my graph to do some explainations to Carl who's sitting facing me. All these years I've never appreciate my own graphs until today. I'll never look at my own graphs the same way again. Grand! Grand altogether!!!

       I had a chat with my mom and dad before they left for Malacca this morning. I didn't sleep well the night before thinking of home. Sigh, I felt homesick now, partly because it's the year of the Monkey, the year I should be so proud of in announcing my age to all my relatives when we do new year visits. Not forgeting the customary red packets, it's also a delight to hear my relatives calling me "Big big girl" or "healthy chubby girl" every new year! We would stay awake yakking till dawn. Then there is also the ever so "kepoh" aunties and uncles asking when I'm getting married. I'm sure they are asking about me now and definately are aware that I'm not around as they would all be left with one extra red packet, that should have been mine! I want my red packets!!! I miss home so much... I miss the food, I miss the festive joy, I miss being around my family...

       Laboratory. I love it and hate it!!! Everything started well, I've got my lab manual in handy, my clean labcoat and my report book. I sat through an introduction and then did my first lab practical on absorbance measurement. I was having a good time preparing postassium dichromate into 3 different solutions of concentration- 100 µmol/l, 200 µmol/l and 400 µmol/l in 5 mmol/l sulphuric acid. The toughest part was calculating volumes of the postassium dichromate required to prepare 2.5ml of the 3 solutions. Then I needed to duplicate the prepared solutions, which simply mean prepare them twice...sigh, I was struggling to understand the instructions, I was looking for a simpler instructions. If you want to know, these instructions was 3 pages long!  The best part was to dilute the "unknown" solution 1:10 with 5 mmol/l sulphuric acid and prepare ten 2.5 ml aliquots of this dilution. Next I get to use the spectrophotometer to read the absorbance of all the dilutions after calibrating it to 350 nm wavelength. It was fun pouring all the prepared dilutions into the cuvette and popped it into the spectrophotometer. This device is awesome, it uses light beam to read the absorbancy of any dilution!  I tried to ignore the fact that today's lab was conducted by Prof Maughn, yes, my "favourite" lecturer but it's impossible. He can be funny, which is when I like him most, and a teaser which is when I dislike him, totally! I just couldn't understand why he likes to critise so many things including us humans! I can't remember how many times he had picked on me. I even checked myself in the mirror many times now, more than ever to see if I had anything unusual about myself! well...after numerous demoralising encounters with him I didn't care anymore. If I retaliate I can be so mean because I have tons of crude jokes that have yet to be heard of, grrr...but no, I still need to keep my goody goody image until I graduate 'cause... cripes! He's assessing my labwork! So, I reckon that it is he himself that needs checking in the mirror!!! Hehe... I am SO looking forward to see him this Thursday for another "pick me or pick your arse" session!!! Grrr...

       I survived my first day. Learnt a whole lot from "current research" module. I was taught on what to consider when writing a critical review of a research paper. Never would have thought it was so complicated and now I really do understand what a quality research paper means. And then the expected nightmares, more courseworks, presentation and writings. Well great....sounds like Term 1 all over again.  For "immunology" module on the other hand I felt like I was in a medical conference. My god!!! I've never heard so much medical jargons since human anatomy and physiology and also therapy during undergrad!!! But it feels good anyway because I felt like a first year student again, only this time I have crunch time, BIG TIME! Gotta go digest more medical terms tomorrow and will look into my immunolgy coursework and presentation some other day. As for tonight, I think I'll read my lab manual. Yes! I'm starting labwork tomorrow and I can't wait to wear my labcoat, although it doesn't look flattering on me but by holding a file and wearing my geeky glasses, I actually think I can look flattering...hmmm... Yayy...I'm going to be a scientist tomorrow! Ermm...well, that sounds too much, better rephrase that..ahem...Yayy! I'm going to "look" like a scientist tomorrow!!!

       I knew sunday wasn't a suitable day for doing laundry but I just had to. I'm still waiting to pop my filthy clothes into the machine, it's ridiculous...waiting among these people, don't they ever do laundry on other days, be it Monday to Saturday, just why OH WHY they choose Sunday? and why I chose sunday? No, I beg to differ, I'm not like those people in the laundry room. I just thought I would start off my Term 2 by washing all my clothes...and I think it's about time I get off that stench in my room. I know that distinctive smell is bad feng shui, now I understood even more after having so much sleepless nights of readings to do! I wonder what is the smell of success? I bumped into Jude too while waiting. She was going to have a game of squash, that's a good way to start off Term 2 methinks. Everybody wants to get off that post exam blues, I guess...

       Although I have not shaken off my post-exam blues, I'm getting myself ready for the second term! In fact, right after my last paper, I hurried off to the library as fast as I could to borrow all the books meant for my second term, which starts on this coming monday. Yeah, I deperately want to improve myself and keep up or I'll be trailing behind. I've learnt mistakes, telling myself that first term is always the hardest, here, for adapting purposes. Second term to get my second chance? Well, hope so. Labwork starts on tuesday and I've already bought myself a nice labcoat at the union. Now all I need to do is to free my brain for more spaces to occupy immunology jargons. Man...more biomedical terms...Term 2 here I come!!!!

       I had my first exercise nutrition paper today at 4pm! Yes, when the sun was about to SET!! 50 tough multiple choices and 2 even tougher essays! I was trying to be deliberate in answering all of them but time was against me. So, I did what I could with rather superbly extravagant handwriting to please- I have never written anything like that before and to untrained eyes, my writings could be mistaken for an artwork instead...jokes aside, I'm quite disappointed with myself. I thought I have in me the trait worthy of a research scientist. I should have taken literature instead, to better my writings, at least, in future my scientific publications would enjoy much popularity. Well, most scientists I know would want to have a bunch of happy readers and hope someday, this could spark off a new generation of fans. This new generation would buy scientific journals instead of girly magazines or the GQs! Crikey! I'm talking craps! Anyhow, I think I should start with writing abstracts, afterall that would determine how well I can coax my readers to read any further! God help me...  Well, one down 2 more to go. Two physiology toughies coming up this thursday & friday and I'm very well sure where I'm going to bury my nose. All these yapping complaints of examinations is making me so disoriented. I'am going to get some sweets to feed my poor deprived-of-glucose brainnnn!!! Arghhhh!!!! Should've smuggled lollies into the exam hall!

Must go grab a bite of that chilli-mustard hotdog.

       I got this off msn.co.uk while eating my dinner. Yeah, eating while surfing or surfing while eating! And I have no qualms or whatsoever for doing this because it's somewhat equivalent to eating in front of the tele. So here it is folks, top ten pick up lines serve to you hot on your desktop! Hehe...the things I do to spice up my blog! Else, I'll be having people sleeping at my blog!  Well, these pick up lines are branded terrible but I want to be as neutral as I can be. To be terrible, I say, it must be tried and tested to be sure, so if you're a man, happily engaged or married I suggest you to stop reading after this point. And for those who are bold (gulp! Lord have mercy on you...) use them at your own risk. Let me know if it works for you! :)   Here goes the ten pick-up lines courtesy of msn.co.uk :   1. There must be something wrong with my eyes because I can't take them off you.   2. If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?   3. Does God know you've escaped from heaven?   4. Bond. James Bond.   5. Do you have a map because I'm lost in your eyes.   6. I'm here now darlin'. What were your other two wishes?   7. Haven't I seen you on the cover of Playboy?   8. I feel like Richard Gere because I'm standing next to the Pretty Woman.   9. Is it hot in here or is it just you?   10. You look so good, I could drink your bath water!   By the way, I like number 6! "Two wishes? I only need one...that is to wish you away, baby!" Hehe...

        urlLink    Brilliant! Now I can even post photos on my blog! I was thinking that if I would make my blog much more appealing, posting photos would be it! I actually took all troubles to go find HTML tag codes and surprise surprise! It's just right under my nose. I finally copied some HTML cheat codes, not after much time understanding what the codes mean and how it work! But it is a rather troublesome task to actually learn all these javascript, HTML codes and what have you to be able to create a richer and elaborate blog!   Until the day I become a javascript master, this is the only photo I'm posting for now...By the way, that's me! The person behind those rambling thoughts!&nbsp;

       Bad boys! I was reading some women website and this has got to be the most enlightening one, at least for today! Well, before I start blabbering about the hot topic...hehe I know I've got some of you excited already...I just want to announce that I've just received my first Chinese New Year card this morning! What a nice chap, good on him for remembering me amidst final year project...  Alright, so what's so appealing about lads who behave badly? I wasn't even sure if I want to quote on this because my Mummy and Daddy would be on their first flight here after reading this. Cripes, it would take a lifetime of efforts to bring back Alan Smith to meet my parents, hehe!  So according to Nicholas of handbag.com, bad boys are a challenge and their perverse insecurity made women lust for them. Speaking of these, the one most perplexing he made was that wild and unpredictable sex has got alot to do with the lust. In fact, I found it to be true in a way because just take a look at Mick Jagger for that matter. Visually appealing..no! but he has got pots of cash to burn!  So...which comes to the question, would you want to be a momma's boy or would you prefer to be spanked?

       I thought I would make myself a cup of hot milk on this cold windy night... and so I took out a carton of skimmed milk from the kitchen shelf. It was a one litre tetra-pak that I bought from Farm Foods a very long time ago and was nearing its expiring date next month.  Usually I would just tear open the flap of the milk carton but today, I chose a brilliant method! Not! And so I thought I could use a knife to cut along the dotted lines on top of the milk carton, gleefully thinking that I can have a perfect opening for the milk to be poured out...alas, I lost my firm grip on the knife and the most tragic thing happened!  I cut my finger! Well, come to think of it, the cut wasn't as tragic as the first time I got my first cut in England. I cut my fingers countless times now but this time I was no cry baby! I just let out a few profanities and hey...it helped to subdue the pain!  Alright now, that doesn't mean you can go swearing after reading this entry!

       Tom Cruise! Yep! I thought he would never make headlines again but ever since "Return of the King" (ROTK) movie night out in Nottingham, I'm pretty convinced that there would be no other movies that could live up to that of ROTK. "The Last Samurai", pardon me but I would rename it "The Last Movie" (to watch)" hehe...but after hearing some comments on The Late Show BBC Radio Leicester, I knew I spoke too soon.   I've always kept my little faithful radio on and when I was about to dunk my head into my pillow the radio presenter of The Late Show, (I think his name was Alex Trelinski) praised Tom Cruise for being a good sport! Now that's a headline, I tell ya...poor Cruise hardly made it into our hot cuppa news nowadays. Cruise was at Leicester Square in London for the UK premiere of the samurai movie and man.., he spent hours signing hundreds of autographs and chatting with 5,000 fans keeping them happy!!  I say Cruise is da man!!! The nicest bloke!!! Anyways, Cruise in my record, is immortalised in Top Gun! He will forever be my boyish F-14 reckless pilot Maverick!! The hotshot killer smile, Mave! Goodness gracious great balls of fire!!! La la la!!

       I was surfing a Malaysian website and I stumbled upon a headline which said new uncut 10 Ringgit notes for auctioning. Ahh...the ringgit...silly as it may sound, I kinda missed using ringgit cash for shopping. There's hardly anything that costs less than a pound here and I have a whole lot of pennies to spare.   Then, I went on another website to check on the current exchange rate and eekk!!! 6.92 Ringgit Malaysia for a misearable quid (as of 7 Jan 2004)! That's a ridiculous one I had to bear, although I admit, I did expect it to rise even before I came to England.  Sigh, higher fees for better education. Talk about encouraging more people to further their studies...

       Since Christmas, I've been trying to keep my room as clean as possible, which I think was quite an effort because it was really hard to stop cookie crumbs from falling out of my mouth when I'm enjoying myself munching a whole tray of Lyon choc cookies.   My disgustingly repulsive table manner can be tracked back to the days when I was just a teenager living out my free days by experimenting. Alright, so I did enjoy chewing my food but little did I realize I was chewing with my mouth open, subconsciously. Up until now, nobody has spoken about my eating ethics and I bet they too enjoyed watching my half masticated foods rolling in my mouth as much I enjoyed the food I'm chewing. At least I'm giving my guts a better treatment!  So...what have you been chewing on lately?

       I was in a deep sleep until my mobile rang and I was rudely awakened. At first I didn't want to drag my fat body up just to see who the caller was. Then my mobile stopped ringing. Alright, so I thought, "oh well, if it was urgent anyway, my mobile would ring again". So it did, for the second time!   This time, I gathered all energy I could churned out from my flabby body and got up. Pushing my blankie aside, I grabbed my mobile on my desk and spoke into it. I was able to muster a rather squeaky sounding "Hello" and hoping the caller at the other end would somehow took notice of my annoyed voice. I didn't get my response and the phone kept ringing. Alright, so I forgot to press answer...hehe. When I was about to look at my mobile window, my mobile stopped ringing. "No Number" it showed. Darn! I placed my mobile back on my desk.   Right! 6am and I am awake. I sat down with my laptop under my palms and voila! An instant message from my mommy! Oh, Yippee!!!  Now it's 10 am. The sky is beginning to show a bright hue of light blue. I can even see little clouds forming. And the sun is appearing as I'm typing this. O wow... I think today's going to be a happy sun shiny day and I'm so lucky to be able to witness this amazing nature's beauty unravelled before my eyes. At this very moment, I was thinking of the anonymous caller. I felt like I owed him my thanks. Ahh...if only his number was shown on my mobile, perhaps I could call him back...

       Wotcher!! Finally, everything is back to normal. Shops are back to business, trying to clear new year leftovers and even Christmas' goods. The road leading to my hall is once again filled with cars and also droves of people walking to pubs few blocks away from where I'm staying. My New Year? Wasn't a blast nor started with a bang. I guess the rain has somewhat taken off my burning excitement. Hard to spark anything in this cold rain. The fireworks were magnificent nonetheless. New Year resolutions? Didn't manage to make any but I'm still sticking to last year's, which of course is still the same as last last year's, and also last last last year's...haha, sounds like old resolutions instead. Oh, well...the best thing about my resolutions is that they can be recycled! How clever is that? But then again, I do have new year wishlist of my own. I think it is somewhat the same as new resolutions.

       Yes, it's snowing again last night and I had a white surprise this morning but that doesn't stop me from walking on the snowed path and in the cold! I used a different path today and I thought I would be the first to make footprints. Someone got up earlier than I did! Still that doesn't stop me from 'over-print' the footprints...get what I mean?   Met with my scottish coursemate in the library today and we got together to find journals. She was nice enough to walk me back to my hall while she pushed her bike all the way. It's amazing how I've developed an ear for hearing Scottish accents now and I've come a long way to achieve that. Besides, another odd comments about me from a british I met in David Collett Hall made me rethink my nationality. I'm in a dire need to speak Bahasa!!!   I've acquired a mumbo-jumbo, mixed accent, all resulted from everyday contacts with my british coursemates. I tried my best to speak as close in accent as possible to match scot's, welsh's, irish's and what have you, so to get my messages clear. Considering the fact that I'm the only asian in my masters course, sometimes I felt lost in between conversation. Nothing in the past has prepared me for this accent-mania! At times I just stood infatuated by these sheer enjoyment. If only people here could speak more BBC-like english...   If I just shut my mouth, I'm from China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. When I speak, it's hard to tell now. I have a neutral accent! But I'm a Malaysian, through and through, and I'm proud of that! Malaysia Boleh!

       I think I can get used to taking blood samples now. All that fears that I once had was gone. Although I've done it numerous times, I still get nervous doing invasive stuffs and that guilt feeling after. It's like having sex and not knowing what the outcome would be after that, I think! :P   I feel like I should praise myself incessantly for doing a good job in the lab today. I don't think I would have done it well without alot of encouragements from (surprise, surprise!) the subject himself! Goodness, I should be the one who should put in the nice words for him since I was the one who did him agony. But he was cool to let me take blood samples from him as many times as I want! It's kinda like him saying "I would bleed for you anytime you want me to, baby!". Dang, someone slap me quick!

       I'll keep telling myself that from now. Actually, I don't really faint when I see blood. Sometimes, I just feel woozy and nauseous but NOT always. I did say SOMETIMES!   I practiced blood sampling today in the lab at the expense of a good looking lad. He's my coursemate and he happily volunteered as our group's subject of study. I practiced blood sampling twice! I didn't get it perfect the first time as I got air bubbles in the capillary tube. So much for doing it like umpteenth time when I was doing my practical training in the National Sports Institute back home. I guess I've lost it. Now I have to regain my confidence. But he's cool, he allowed me to practice with 3 capillary tubes and only 2 pricks since he's bleeding alot. Very good lad indeed. I hope he'll be alright when the proper test starts this thursday cause I'll be collecting blood sample for analysing, 5 times!   So, 2 of us will be responsible for gas collection and analysing, 1 for heart rate monitoring and I will be collecting blood for lactate and glucose. We've got our experimental design prepared after a brain storming session today. We'll see the effect of carbohydrate feeding after 30 mins of cycling on ergometer, and will continue to cycle another 30 mins.   Should be a fun day at the lab this thursday!

       I am beginning to wonder how on earth can I lose weight in this cold climate. Started my jogging at a slowest speed possible to minimise cold air into my mouth so to prevent dry mouth, tried breathing through nose but only to have slimy mucuous exited my nostrils along with some 'interesting' bits and pieces that have been kept in those dark crevices(saved me from all that periodic nose digging!)   The day was sunny but it was freezing due to the merciless wind blowing so strong. I had to force myself forward in the wind. The wind seemed to be coming from all directions and at times I felt like I was jogging on the spot. The same thing happened when I was cycling to the library the other day. The wind was against me.   And the cold weather wasn't a help either. I wasn't sweating much, well, I don't feel I was oozing sweat anyway and I doubt that I had actually exercised! I sounded so negative, probably caused by my lazy nature, always giving excuses to get away from exercising in the cold...brrr... still, exercising is easier said than done but to refrain myself from eating my mandatory 6 meals a day? Exercise easier done than said. I don't want to skip the thing I love to do. Eat.

       Pissing is so much fun now after having a lab session on markers of morning hydration status. Well, the idea of messing with your own urine is not quite something you can do when you're just a child years ago. Imagine now, all grown up and you get to do it without having mom yelling at you for playing with your own excreta! :)   All I need to do was to fast from 9pm onwards last night, no breakfast the next morning. Then at approximately 7.30am-8am on test day, I must drink 1 pint of water and have nothing else to eat or drink. So pissing started at 9am, collected it, measured its volume, determine colour, specific gravity and osmolality. I had to piss 3 times at 0h, 1h and 2h with another 1 pint of water (I can choose between a sports drink/plain water) after 0h analysis. That's pissing 3 times in 2 hours duration!   There's 3 groups altogether. Hypohydration group (poor coursemates, they had no drink/food since 9pm the day before test), euhydration-fasted group (that's me!) and euhydration-fed (eat and drink as usual). Results wise, really facinating in terms of colour...different shades of yellow. The urine osmolality is a better measurement than specific gravity nonetheless as it measures concentration and not affected by size of particle dissolved in the urine. I've left about 5mL of my urine for osmolality analysis later.   As far as the immediate result is concerned, I'm happy to say that I'm well-hydrated although my perceived hydration was hypohydrated because I felt thirsty throughout the test, even with 1 pint of water. My body was able to retain about 27% of the water consumed on the first hour, which I urinated about 365mL. At 2h, I've got 310mL! So to sum it up, I've urinated 675mL! I've pissed more than I drank! It definately showed that I may be a diuretic when I only consume plain water. Sports drink could be a better drink as its sodium content would help retain fluid in the body. But still I have yet to get my osmolality result to write up my report and also some further readings to back it up.   The lab somehow had a funny smell and god-knows-what someone could have spilled some urine somewhere. We all will be so contaminated if the slightest, teeny tiniest droplet of piss gets onto our hands or (god forbids) mouths!! We can't just shut our pieholes during analysis, can we? I started the test starving and hungry but after all that pissing, in and out of the loo, analysing, then in and out of the loo again to discard piss... I don't feel hungry anymore and don't even think of trying to offer me to drink TEA!!!

       Laboratory practicals calculations have gone from difficult to easy thanks to the creator of Excel spread sheet and SPSS!!! Sixth Form statistics/math equations are things of the past where we constantly punched on our calculators, and you wondered why your fingers were stubby. I might as well loan my scientific calculator to somebody else since I rarely use it now unless for really practical reasons... like converting GBP to MYR or vice versa, if you know what I mean.   And I love Dr Susan Shireffs lectures! She rocks!!! She conducted lab practical so well that I now love the study of hydration status! I'm so torn between two research areas, also love Prof Mike's overtraining. Have to start sorting it out before 27th Feb. So much work to do. where do I begin? better finish up my critical review paper first.

       A guest talk during one of my tutorial slot by Dr Stephen McGregor on physiology support in football clubs two days ago had me thinking alot, well, for two full days. Even in my sleep, I was not spared of my beauty sleep, I'm trying to re-evaluate my life. Not the past but the now and future life. The past has already brought me here so I can easily ignore that. It is NOW and the WHAT-WILL-COME that worried me most. Dr Steve, as he is known by the students/lecturers here, was a young academician who happens to walk the path that I've always dreamed about.   His first degree from U of Sunderland, in physiology and sport science gave him a good head start for doing both masters (Sport science) and research degree (PhD in the area of exercise physiology) in Loughborough. He has lecturing posts in Sunderland Uni and also Durham Uni and on top of that, he worked for Sunderland FC before moving over to Leeds United FC. And now he has another, working at Aston Villa FC, all in the name of providing sports science support to all the respective footie clubs.   I envied his career, his experience, his opportunities, YES, his LIFE!!! His talk was aiming at us physiologist/scientist hopefuls. We were given somewhat like a career talk on what to expect on the job. And as he sees it, masters degree is just the tip of the iceberg. Apparently, (like we all dont know already, duh) research needs a hell lot of mooney and the big question popped! HOW CAN WE GET THAT KIND OF MONEY? and so apparently and so currently, Leeds United FC is so in financial constraints and I really understand why we can have 2 or more jobs at hand, if we can manage. Then the issues about 'trust' for getting research done. Of course I want to be a gaffer of the research, THE BIG BOSS of the lab, in other words. I can't do all the research on my own and can I really trust just any joe blokes to handle them? MSc is not enough, so go for PhD then. and still it doesn't stops there. I have to keep my arse close to a academic institution. Give lectures, be a lecturer, just get a post in the university. I reckon it's an excuse to borrow the lab (hehe, I may even use it for free!!! Throw in some white lies and I'm on my way to research stardoom, oppss spelled wrongly, stardom!) if there's not much revenue for PhD. Alternatively, I could marry a rich husband and ask him to help fund my research. Sounds romantic though but not a great idea, cause it may cause me to look like a femme fatale who cheats on marriage. Sigh...so much decisions and plannings to do. I'm not even halfway through my MSc yet and my mind has already bogged by this. I'm serious at revamping my life. I want to do something great for myself that I enjoyed doing most. No, not hitting on any footie lads nor watching them strip before me for physio test. I most certainly know why Dr Steve has been so passionate about this job (multiple jobs is more like it) he has. Apart from attractive salary, the experience has got to do with it. It's priceless. He can actually 'foresee' which youth players would make it to the premier league clubs, thanks to the wonders of physiology. At this very moment I'm imagining myself turning cheap players to expensive ones by the work of physiology.   I am counting too much chickens hatchlings from so little eggs, am I not? Must be the knock on my forehead last sunday. I've got a painful-when-touched bump on my head. Read my next entry.

       ~A Glass of Cold Water~  My heart endured wretching of all means,  I see no helpings which could satisfy these painful hunger,  As much as I desire to binge on happiness but now I'm eating away sorrows,  and drowning my despair with a glass of cold water,  If I survived a day without foods of joy,  Then my heart reserve the right for more cravings,  Though being outstripped by delicious pleasure,  A glass of cold water would suffice to put back dried tears in my eyes,  For tears may cleanse to purify my discontented soul.

       O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head  Which have no correspondence with true sight;  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled  That censures falsely what they see aright?  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,  What means the world to say it is not so?  If it be not, then Love doth well denote  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: No,   How can it? O how can Love's eye be true,  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?  No marvel then though I mistake my view:  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.   O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find!  ~Blind Love  by: William Shakespeare (1546 - 1616)   So, tis a love poem from Sir Will,  Which I read with much feel,  How I can relate without much effort,  Does tis mean that True Love is what I cannot exert?   *haha, I am so not cut out for poetry writing, Anyway, the colour of my blog, changed it for the mood. If this colour sparks the mood, jumping frog legs!!!, then I'm colour-fantastic, Hail THE PINK PASTEL PRINCESS*

       Two more days left and I'll be on my own working my arse off in the immunology lab. There's so much going on in my head and at this very moment I wish I was invincible. Time passes by so quickly here. In fact there was a time I was hoping I could work at the speed of the rotating earth, if you know what I mean. Come to think of it, that's not possible 'cause I would then had to travel across the globe. That would be so silly unless I could take Loughborough with me. It's just a figure of speech anyway...my main point was to have time standing still, perhaps, so I could have more time for myself. There's so much to do!   I'll certainly miss my lectures and the great days I had in the practical lab sessions with my coursemates. I still definitely would choose to attend lectures no matter how much hassles it may have caused me- I'm recalling the days I had to trudge in heavy snow fall and RAIN!!! There's so much rain here enough to rival a day of monsoon back home. And there was the gales. Gales. Sounds like a nice word. Funny how I've learnt a new word out of experiencing English weather. but GALES! Let's just say it's an obligatory cuppa I had everyday here.   Alright. Let's just see how I can make the most out of my remaining two days of lectures and practical lab sessions. Cheers to myself!

       Someone sent me this and it's pretty funny.    A woman goes to her boyfriends' parents' house for dinner. This is to be her first time meeting the family, and she is very nervous. They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal. The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are about making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof.   Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog which had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a rather stern voice, "Skippy!" The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A few minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again.This time,she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip.   The father again looked at the dog and yelled, Dammit Skippy!" Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later, the woman had to let another one rip. This time, she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.   Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit Skippy, get away from her before she shits on you!"

       I was in time for immunology lecture and Prof Mike was kind enough to delay a few more minutes for the nutrition MSc students to come over as they were attending a guest talk, apparently given by someone from the Manchester United FC on nutrition.   Before long, they made it to class and the Irish kid sat next to me. He asked for the time and pointing to my wrist watch as well.   It reminded me of someone who told me to refrain from pointing to the wrist when asking for time. It was said by doing that, it seemed to be similar to the act of pointing to the crotch when asking where the toilet is. Having recalled that, I tried not to giggle myself obvious.   There maybe more to learn about Irish mannerism, other than their cute Irish accent.

       Feeling abit guilty for abandoning my blog for quite sometime now. Have alot to tell but haven't the time to put everything into here.   It snowed on friday, the day of my presentation. Walked in heavy snow fall and I felt like I was in one of my english story books I read when I was a child, walking in the snow was magical. But the cold weather made my nose mucousy; some of it trickled down my throat and stayed there, as if furtive until I presented my first power point slide-My voice cracked and I had to clear my throat twice! Oh, how embaressing it was doing that in front of my lecturer and coursemates. Nonetheless, it's finally over and I managed to answer all the questions directed at me.   Earlier on the same week (monday), that's 4 days before precisely, I presented for my current research on physiology. I had to say, having to present 2 different papers was a tremendous feat, let alone to present them on the same week! If given a chance, I'll never do it. I rather have them on a different week instead. I was stuffed in the brain, nervous etc and it was evident when I answered the first question directed at me by one of my fellow coursemate. I gotta say, this guy had me stumped! No, not in a bad way. His question was alright, but it was me...just don't know what had got into me. It was clear that he was trying to help me to look good in the Q & A, so to gain marks but I stumbled. There goes my Q & A marks. Then, after a field of questions by everyone else including my lecturer, he gave me another question as if to compensate my disappointing first question. This time, I did it rather alright, trying very hard not to look into his eyes or I'll spill my words everywhere again. So, a lesson to be learnt here. Never look directly into the eyes of a good lad. It proved to be a deadly mess to the mind. He did helped me again on friday's presentation but I looked everywhere else except his eyes. Gosh...my crazy-rolling eye balls must have looked really silly. but anyway, monday's presentation overall was okay, I've also worn my Baju Kedah so to introduce one of my many national dresses, which served as a good prologue although not as good when I had to walk in small steps in it. It took me 30 minutes longer to get to the lecture hall.   I've also hand-in a crappy report after my monday's presentation. That investigation of hydration status using urine was easier done in lab than writing it up. Seeing the fact that the investigation had unbalanced number of subjects in each study group, I gave much postulations in the discussion part as the results obtained was rather unconvincing. Not much literature to back it up strongly either although I tried to but I blamed the uneven number of subjects not myself. Sigh, I was really stressed out figuring what statistical test to use. Ughh... like purging my research methodology from last term for good use here, at least I'm still keeping research knowledge in my already stuffed brain.   Now, I'm once again in front of my laptop typing furiously for my overtraining essay; combining automic imbalance, neuroendocrine disturbances, plasma cytokines and glycogen depletion attributions to form a 2000 words essay. Tough to my arse. Had been sitting reading journal articles that had been strewn everywhere on my desk and bed since I don't know when. I can't even remember when was the last time I cleaned my room. I'm so unorganised but it didn't matter as long as I get to finish my writing.

       Gracious... it has been like a month already since I left my blogging activity. I was completely engaged with myself of all things that just came to me. Maybe I should track back my activities back to the last entry. Then again this would take a great lot of time.   I've started yet another online activity: posting photos on the web. Basically I've done this with my family in mind. Then it occurred to me that I once wanted to do a documentary of myself, a time capsule if you like. It was my long ago list of things to do because I thought it would pays off in future that I may want my grandchildren or great grandchildren or great-great grandchildren to learn about me, their ancestor. I know this would satisfy the ever so curious minds of little kids, like I once had when I was a child but I wasn't exactly given a proper narrative or that sort of thing. Besides, it would be very expensive to hire someone to do my biography, so one more reason to do it myself although not done professionally. I mean, what is there to hide? I wouldn't want any editing or makeups done just to make my self-documentary look good and pretty.   This whole idea of documenting my life will probably take up my precious time. Maybe I should do it in my free time, well maybe not. Time is a luxury I dont have now. Alright then, maybe after my degree, that is if I dont get carried away with other new things that seemed to pop up constantly and got me interested. Maybe I'm attracted to things that are new. Yes, it is. And I also get bored easily so it's hard for me to stay put.   Now back to my top priority. My reports.

       A day in the immunology lab was really taking its toll on me. But luckily I have a soccer protocol familiarisation running to do, so it wasn't a boring day. It was only a familiarisation run and I was finding it hard to perform. It was pure 90 minutes intermittent sprint, fast jog and walk, non stop across 20 m line, accept for the 3 mins rest during half time. I have to perform 2 sets of 90 mins, one set with only 250 mL water and the other NONE!!! I knew my VO2max will not take me any further or maybe I should just admit that I cannot be a soccer athlete! I'll fail miserably for this test but I'll try to finish the run so that Kim and Rob can have my data for their dissertation write up.  On a more enjoyable side, I was invited over to the university pool at half 5pm to check out the Great Britain swimming team, hard at training for Athens. Being so tiny among the swimmers, I was hardly noticeable to them and I was trying hard not to bump my face into their toned pecs. But it was a great experience for me as Jude took me around and introduce me to the team and the work that has to be done there with the team. All the swimming coaches were very friendly and I liked the way they train the swimmers in a lively and funny atmosphere. I met Ian Turner, and a few other coaches too.

       Now I know what it felt like to have performed a maximal oxygen consumption test, better known as VO2 max test! The cycle until exhaustion was harder than I thought and I couldn't even finish the stage where 2.5 kg load was applied, that was only at 175 workrate! I couldn't maintain 70 rpm anymore and I stopped after 8 minutes of cycling. I've got to admit, my aerobic fitness is not one I could be proud of. Time for me to work my body cells to extract and use more oxygen!  Well, taking part in my own research was a way to go for me...for now at least, I know what my human volunteers had to endure this deadly protocol. High intensity cycling and no mercy! An experimental protocol designed to kill the legs rather than to produce killer legs! Gulp! But hey, it's supposed to be super-ultra fatiguing exercise so I could investigate on overtraining. So, research comes first, sympathies later!

       This was the best birthday dinner in England. Although I felt abit tired from Stratford-upon-Avon tour, Mon and Chris set up a birthday surprise dinner for me and had Nobuko and Irina devised some tactical plan to revert my attention the whole day to get me a gift.   The tour to Stratford was already a nice birthday gift for me and had a wonderful lunch in a garden teahouse. I'm really going to missed it so much, the time spent with Nobuko and Irina. Irina's going back to Germany very soon.  Dinner was good. Spent our time chatting away and our research topics were obligatory in our conservation nonetheless as all of us did a different MSc courses. I had a memorable birthday dinner!  Ok. Now I have to set up a phone date with my dad. His birthday's 3 days away.

Why...it's a day I've spent that I'll never forget! ~Shakespeare Mistress, Marilyn Ong May23Yr04;12:45   Ok. OKAY! I maybe some cheap poet and composed the worst poetry that I think anyone would even pay to see my poetry being burnt if they were written on papers! Yeah, why the heck I would be spoilt rotten on a Sunday anyway? Don't know myself...poetry's supposed to be ambiguous. Go ahead, it's open to your own interpretation. I welcome your thoughts!  I had another road trip to  urlLink Stratford-upon-Avon  , this time a ladies' trip with Nobuko and Irina. I've got to say it was a real rush popping in and out of the famous houses in the Shakepeare's Town as we arrived there at noon. Well, as anybody would have guessed it, I need to fill my tummy first, so we had lunch in the garden opposite the  urlLink Swan Theatre .   Although we started at noon to tour the houses, we managed to brisk walk all  urlLink Shakepeare Houses . Spent most of the time in Shakepeare's Birthplace and Exhibition as I really wanted to know more about this super poet and dramatist. I traced his life all the way back trying to find if there was in any way a similarity to my life as well. Hehe... I have a shameless thought! Unfortunately, I cannot be compared to this human extraodinaire. He came from a humble background and then became rich and famous through his great works of playwriting and sonnets. Okay, I've learnt that although it was good to work your way up from scratch, I'm working towards it a little tad different, which is not-so-rich and not-so-famous. I'm happy to earn enough to take my arse around the world and to get me country house without having to be bugged by the public.   The worst was Mary Arden's House (Home of Shakepeare's mother) and The Shakespeare Countryside Museum as we hardly took a good look at what's there accept that we had somekind of a notion that it's a farm or barn where there's pink pigs,black & white cattles, white owls, etc. Oh... and I even saw Rikki, the Snowy Owl who has appeared in the Harry Potter films but I haven't watched any of the Potter films so I wasn't abit impressed. I enjoyed all the gardens and most of all the sun, as it was shining brightly everytime we were in the garden. But, although there was alot of sunhine to roast my cheeks, it was a cold day. Really eerily cold. Weird.  They said that Stratford makes an ideal setting for romantic breaks but I beg to differ. All these lovely histories told about Shakespeare Town does have its appeal if you and your darling other half are both historians. I don't think I wanna do that exchanging love vows thing in that town and have the ghost of Shakespeare to witness it...well, unless we have a really good original poetry to read for each other, then Sir Will WILL NOT be rolling in his grave. I hope...  After much sight seeing and seeing the sights of lovey-dovey couples around the so-called romantic town, we head back to Loughborough for another surprise... I'll save for the next entry. Gotta hit the sack!

       Oh dear! My fitness has really gone from bad to worst! I did my shuttle run (bleep test) yesterday for Kim's study and my estimated VO2 max is something I'm not really proud of. I better not brag about it else it would affect my following familiarisation test which will be on coming Thursday. More high intensity running.   On a happy note, my study has been a good one, still up and running. For starters, I had a very cooperative and nice lad. It's real hard for me to actually see him getting "tortured" by my high intensity protocol. Well, good things would only happen to him. What a good lad for offering himself for my study amidst dissertation write up and research MADNESS now!! Everyone's desperate for volunteers at the moment and there aren't many apparently because the number of research exceeds the volunteer population! And of course, there's strict criterias involved as not to have the same subject volunteering for too many other research study, or else we'll all have a really messed up results. Oh, and I wanna add that Carl has been really nice to ring me and volunteer himself for my study as well. Bless him. I have a really good coursemate!  Alright. I think someone should start teasing me about my fat arse so that I'll refrain myself from that 500g tub of Stracciatella Carte D'Or ice-cream. Oh wait, I've already finished that. Ok, I'll refrain from having my mouth anywhere near the 500g Triple Choc that is still sitting in the freezer. Someone, anybody..please lock up the freezer, please!

       I was really inspired by a blogger who puts up a lifetime project called "Project 365" in which he vows to snap at least a photo a day. So, I've decided to take my photographing skills (I can operate a camera, a good ehough skill, no?) to a better level. There's none a better way to do this than photographing myself for starters! I want to break that photographer's norm, being anonymous that is. I'm a high profiler if you like...if my photos turned out good I think I can be proud of myself. And I can add that to my self-documentary.

         I bought some oranges at the open market yesterday which I thought they looked like mandarin oranges. Boy, was I so wrong. It was really difficult to peel the darn oranges and them skin squirt yellow juice that's stains my table cloth and caused my fingers to have this yellow tint. Thank goodness I wore a black Tee. Then I have this sudden urge to photograph them, at least it would serves as a reminder for me 'cause I prolly won't buy them again!!!

         I have to admit, when it comes to taking photos, I'm such a loser. I seemed to be unconscious of having a camera in my hand most of the time. I've an affinity to just look and stare at my surroundings with my naked eyes. Thus, I have so little exciting photos in my collection. Someone has got to remind me to snap from this day onwards!

         This card came in early today through the post with my name written across a cake, which seemed to be a cheese cake. At first I thought it was just a cheap card that someone has scribbled my name on it with some markers but no! It was nicely printed, after they have my name on it using some sort of paint software.     See? It even has my name and address nicely printed that doesn't comes off when I rubbed them. A prove that it wasn't written with a marker! Heh!     I guess being a "more than regular" customer to Sainsbury's, I must be properly rewarded. Yes, I shop in Sainsbury's twice a week which is mandatory for me. Sometimes, late in the evening I would just pop in to get some foods, especially so in the winter, I'm always hungry all the time. I think I'm going to miss Sainsbury's a lot and its familiar orange hue if I decide to go home for good. Not forgetting that funny naked chef, Jamie Oliver that face of Sainsbury's advert. He's gonna be stucked in my mind for quite long.     Aww... and they're giving me chocolates as a birthday treat! How appropriate! I love chocolates! Now, losing my current weight will have to wait then. I definately have to stop by Sainsbury's tomorrow.

       I thought it would be nice to have a birthday wishlist prepared in time before my birthday comes. I know this sounds too much or extremely desirous if you'd say...but wishing is easier to do. I suppose that acquiring something you wish would be a whole lot of another story. Sometimes, a wish should just stay as a wish, making something you wish elusive or unattainable is much more challenging in a way. Some of my wishes are shortlived, I'm a very fickle person and I'm always into new things. Discard the old usher the new. No wonder no one can put up with me.   Here goes my wish list for Birthday year 2004 in no particular order:   1. Graduate nicely and get a job as a physiologist after getting my degree or better, before graduation.   2. Hope to do my PhD if I do not get a job that I wanted or if I do get a job, I want to do my PhD part time.   3. Earn pounds/dollars and 100 times more if I earn in ringgit.   4. Repay all my loans.   5. Retire early (when I hit 35 yrs, 40? or maybe 50 then)and buy a house in the countryside by a river or sea, on the hill/mountain, in the forest...(you might as well ask me to live in a cave, yeah?).   6. I want to be a farmer when I retire and also milking the cows and herding sheeps (I'm sane when I typed this). I'm farm girl material I think...well not quite, a farm old lady is more like it (retired).   7. See my family more than I see myself in the mirror.   8. Start putting together my self-documentary, in digital format and hard copy scrap book.   9. Wants to play more musical instruments, master the violin and guitar first and foremost (which makes the next wish more sense...)   10. Taylor 614CE   11. Travel the world and more backpacking/road trips.   wishlist to be continued...

         The so familiar man-at-work. This one, my catch of the day showed the ever so powerful cam of mine. I was like more than a kilometre away. It really amazed me how this man can stay atop the roof without any safety harness but these are very common sight in the Kingfisher way area. New houses are popping up everyday and this one with the man on top is the new Kingfisher hall.

         Also, on my way back to Forest Court from the immunology lab, I finally chose to stop today and enjoy the little lake which I pass by whenever I walk to university. There used to be a young swan on the lake during winter but since spring season it was nowhere to be seen. I guess it has grown and decided to fly to a better lake. Prolly it was mating season too. These little ducklings and their mommy duck are new addition to the lake. I once saw their daddy too but their mommy's there for most of the time. Everything was quiet and still for me at that moment but I enjoyed the time being alone.

         On my way back to Forest Court, I came across some colourful balloon pieces scattered on the road that probably have all been burst the night before. It brings back old memories of my many birthdays I had. Balloons have always been a key element in my birthdays but I had lesser balloons in my late teens and now? None! Sob sob...anyway, it's good to reflect on something like these.

       I spoke to my mom about my plans to fly back home in September/October yesterday. There wasn't much decisions made, whether or not I should stay back or fly home. During the chat, we were both not in the state of mind about the topic; the truth will have you fall off the chair! My mom was chatting with me hastily because she was watching the Thomas Cup Badminton tourney live on tele and after answering every question I posed, she will just repeat the same phrase "You eat well, yah?". I reckon her eyes and mind were fixed to the tele. But one thing for sure her heart was not. My mom can be so funny at times...I know she loves me more than anything else in the world, not even Wong Choong Hann can stand between us! Hah! but sigh... I missed the badminton hype in Malaysia and the broadcast from Jakarta, Indonesia.   Alright, since I've not quite been the good daughter for being so far away from home and away from my responsibilities, this is a tribute to my mom! I love you, Mommy!!! Flying kiss to you all the way from England!!! MUaaakkkss!!!

       Woke up late at 15 minutes before 11 in the morn. Tony and Trevor have already finished cleaning up my flat. I ate my breakfast, my favourite cold milk (non-skimmed, yes laden with enough fat to stuff your arse massive) poured over honey nut corn flakes! Alright, it was my BRUNCH! Darn it! I missed my breakfast today.   There wasn't much I can do today but I did went for a drink at Lloyd's bar. Had a hot chocolate and a chocolate chip muffin. More fats to worry me guilty but I wasn't complaining at all. The selection of musics at the bar was good. I sang along to the tunes of Maroon 5's, Robbie William's and Texas' as I munched my muffin. For every bite I took, I felt my fat arse grow 1 mm wider.   Sometimes I did questioned my rear end alot and wondered why it was this big. I had a fall once, off the stairs, landed on my arse and it didn't cushion my fall. And to think the extra fats in my arse would act as a shock absorber, I was really really wrong.   But anyway, although I hated the size of my arse, I'm glad shops are selling pants that I could fill it in. Besides, I'll need to use my arse to sit and have to take it along with me wherever I go. Plus, I need to fart occasionally too. So, if I love myself, I have got to love my arse too and give it a more tenderly care.   Now... if only I could kiss my rear end...

         And..while I'm still in the mood for eating, I thought of putting up some of the food I've eaten. The green curry on the left is my favourite Thai dish cooked by my Thai flatmate's mom. See, I've even got the green curry paste in it's sachet beside the bowl of curry. The chocolatey and yummy gooey on the right is a tiramisu dessert, I ate a quarter of it.     This meal, a smoked trout with load of vegetables (broccoli, carrots, purple cabbage and baked baby potatoes too) I ate in a pub restaurant called "The Ship" in Plymouth. It was an alright dish but I much prefer the steam fish dish back home.     This was my first traditional English meal cooked for me by Frances on my last day of stay in her cottage in Chudleigh, Newton Abbot. It consisted of baked ham sliced thinly, baked potatoes and parsnips, homemade yorkshire pudding, steamed green peas, carrots and fresh purple broccoli I plucked from Frances' backyard. Oh, and the delicious onion+pork gravy poured over the sliced ham was ever so tasty. Too bad I didn't took a photo of the dessert, apple crumble. I couldn't resist eating it, and I finished it before I could even be conscious of photographing it.

          Although Chudleigh seemed to be very small considering some tight paths I've come across like this one here, there isn't a time you would notice that somehow. Maybe because there wasn't many people living there as opposed to big cities where you would have to rub arses with people at rush hours.

          I still remember vividly of the little stream at Chudleigh, Newton Abbot in Devon. It was the stream that lulled me to sleep at night during my stay at Frances'. I was trying hard not to sleep because I wanted to hear the stream for as long as I can. That said, I missed it so much.

       It's the seventh day of the month of May. I've finished my exam on the fourth. I wondered whether it was my last one. My last exam ever. It was really exhausting, to say the least after the exam. It was like I've channelled all my energy into the paper, my brain milked dry and my hands trembled involuntarily so much as if I've been zapped by electricity. I think it was caused by emotions more than anything else. The day before I tossed and turned on my bed trying to sleep. I guess I was worried to the point of insomnia.  Well... the exam's over and it's best to keep away from having to recall the tumultuous exam. Besides, May was suppose to be the most wonderful month of the year, every year!   I think I've turned into a soft drink slash hot chocolate junkie considering the amount of time I've spent in pubs and cafes here. Seriously, I wouldn't have think twice if I'm offered to endorse Pepsi and kick Beckham's arse off the Pepsi throne. Beers- its alluring gold, foamy drink have its persuasive appeal that drawn me to it nothing more than just smelling it. Cripes, I could get woozy even by its smell. Shameful or not, I can't drink. So, the post exam night out at Orange Tree, Newhouse and Pulse had me drinking cola all the way. No one would ever suspect it was a soft drink that I was drinking because it looked like I'm drinking stout or something, except the bartenders of course and I don't think they were happy to serve me kiddies' drink, I'm sure.   But I had a good time away from uni pressures.

       Yesterday was the longest day in UK. So it's summer. But, my biological clock told me that it was indeed a long day for me. I was dead tired and yawning all day!  I haven't much time to update my blog. I've had busy but enjoyable month of June. I could juggle between research and play at the same time, but not without being exhausted. I need sleep. A lot of it.

        urlLink    Marilyn before becoming fat again urlLink     So I've been the laziest and sloppiest girl ever! I shouldn't be blogging about my recent bad habits (I'm always viewed as the clean and tidy girl..*cough, Cough, COUGH*)... well... I don't clean my room anymore due to lack of time. I know when I start cleaning my room, I'll never stop and I'll take one whole day to complete it. So, I rather not start it to save time.  On eating, I suppose eating with my fingers saves me time as well. I'm not gonna start saying about those dishes (stop imagining!!!). Let's just say, I'm trying to be economical and saving time, again. I hope I've been making use of my saved time for my write up!  Sleeping... well, I've been drinking so much of coffee recently, I ended up being so dehydrated and I fell sick almost instantly the next day. Bad idea to save time by not going to the loo, mates. Now, my body's circadian rhythm has messed up so bad, I'm sleeping at almost anytime of the day and night. Plus, I have no fixed breakfast, lunch or dinner time.  I really looked terrible now. I think I've piled on lots of weight because I could not fit into my 28' khaki pants. I'm back to my chubby self...

       After my tiring days of assays in the lab (NOTE: It's Assay&nbsp;NOT Essay and yes!!!! I do both of them unfortunately, Assay=chemical analysis and essay=writing, writing & more writing, ughh!!!), I kinda missed it so much, now that I'm back to sitting in front of my laptop typing. I've returned the immunology and biochemistry lab keys this morning. Well, if I still miss the lab... I can always pop in to visit Glen or Gary in the lab researching. I will miss the days having to work in a pleasant environment of that is Immunology RR005! Oh, no.. don't look into my eyes, it's getting abit moist...  Okay, melodramatic me&nbsp;aside, I want to blog about what I've been up to few days back. I had a short trip to Leicester on Thursday the 22nd, just 12 mins ride on train. Nothing much to see... just had a drink and unwind a little. I desperately needed a break from Loughborough and all this writing up&nbsp;research project&nbsp;madness. Then had a big meal at Wetherspoon in Loughborough (Yes again! I'm eating out so much here, I would scare the lights out of any lads who would want to date me. Ack!!). Only foods can keep me happy, I dare say... On Saturday the 24th, my Thai flatmate asked me to go shopping at NEXT as they're having a summer sale. I've always been loving Next's clothings and I can't help it being born a woman, shopping is one of the biggest passion but I'll need to get a job before splashing on clothings. For now, I got 2 leather belts for GBP11! So much for summer sale, I think I&nbsp;should give my credit card a rest for 3 weeks starting today. I better be resting it and oh, did I blog about my nice new pairs of Nike walkies? I so have to break into them one of these days when it's not raining... heck, when&nbsp;does it&nbsp;NOT rain in England?  Alright... back to writing.

I&nbsp;do&nbsp;admit I'm not good at picking the best ones but at least I'm making a good effort in posting it. Don't complain, okay?

       I've been dreaming alot lately and food seems to make the most&nbsp;appearance. I dreamt of roti jala and yummy chicken rendang few days ago. And the weirdest of all, I dreamt of someone kissing someone. I think it's a nightmare to have an&nbsp;indecent dream like that one. Someone has to wake me up, pleaseeeee...   On a lighter note, I'm taking a short break in Leicester. I need to unwind alittle because I've been so stressed about my research write up lately. Of course, I also need lots of food to keep me happy.    ********************************************    Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become.

       Have not been updating but I'm doing fine. Goodness...it has been almost a month now since I last blogged. Good stuffs and bad are happening to me, so don't any of you dare think I'm not having a time of my life here. Just too lazy to blog. Besides, my research project has been such a pain. I'm whinging alot to ease the pain. It's a good learning process for me, nonetheless, it's helping me in paving a way to becoming an experienced&nbsp;researcher me. &nbsp; So if you'll excuse me, I have&nbsp;many statistical data to do and more write up!

       All of the sudden, I felt something. I felt something amiss. More like an emptiness, really. It just occurred to me that I have 6 more days left to the day I hand in my dissertation. Six more days. Seemed not too far away. I've already felt something about this. Something that I just could not describe in words. Hence, I have trouble explaining it the beginning of this entry.  I've started doing alittle shopping this afternoon. Just an excuse to get out of my room really because I've been in my room for almost a week without stepping out into the sunlight. And guess what? I'm not exaggerating when I say sunlight. It's hot summer in England. Hotter than you think a small bird-eye chilli could make you sweat. And what's worst can be doing me in a delightful/bountiful light bright summer you say?... my room window, sigh...go read my previous entry. I say this a summer for you to strip down to nothing!  Back to shopping...yeah, spent quite alot on shower creams and shampoos really cause I've been showering alot. Four times per day. And I bought a miserable lunch. Onion and cheese jacket potatoes in styrofoam container. Lots of chedder cheese, butter and onion. and the melted butter was flooding the hot potatoes and melted cheese. It was like eating a bowl of oil. Fat ladden, pure fat, fatty junk...I could go on and on with the fat word. I could've splash on healthy food to be honest. I could... no, I mean I should...no no.. I must! There! I've said it. Although, that jacket potatoes was only the "tip of the iceberg". I bought 3 pack of chocolate bars. I think it was named Aero Bubble or Bubble No squeak chocs or something I couldnt' remember. But one thing I could remember was, I bought it with an assumption that "holes" in the chocs mean less chocs, and less chocs mean less fats. Dont try to prove me wrong mates...or I'll feed my chocs to the dang pigeons nesting on the tree outside my window. You dont want me to prove that obesity can exist among pigeons.  And so... back to my entry prologue, I think I'm beginning to understand why my sudden emptiness. I'm finishing my course soon and I'm flying back home. Golly, how time flies when you have such busy schedule. Few days back I was browsing all my photos taken during my stay in England. I really going to miss England alot and I'm not afraid to tell I'm a sappy pappy pulp that I'm going to break down and cry. I'll hold back my tears for now. I'm trying...  From the photos I browsed, I came upon a photo that I think would make my parents really jealous... a photo taken with my English family. Err..correction, my host family. Well... at least I've experienced it the English way, living, eating and speaking...I hope I dont sound too different.    urlLink    The Shackleton's family and me sitting under the hot English sun in front of the Shackleton's cottage by the Leeds-Liverpool canal in Barnoldswick. From L-R: Andrew, Pamela, Marilyn (That's me!) and Chris.  urlLink

       With the scorching sun shining through my window, I barely had the patience to sit through the whole day typing on my research project. Although I had a vanilla flavoured ice-cream from the McD in town yesterday (all the dang shops close on Sunday), it was still the hot still air in my room that does not seem to dissipate anywhere. And the dang window also adds to my woes, it does not open large enough for even a monstrous mosquito to fly into my room.  Now, I shower 4 times on average or more if I soil my shirt from perspiration. I sweat even by sitting here typing away. And I'm doing laundry more often now.   It's still hot today by the way...dang the hot weather!
