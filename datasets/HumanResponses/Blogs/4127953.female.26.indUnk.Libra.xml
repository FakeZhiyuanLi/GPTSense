      I have to take a break for a minute with my daily activities and talk about my lack of love life. I have to get this off my shoulder……. I am so sick and tired of boys (notice how I didn’t say MEN) and their eager willingness to play games. Scenario #1 (my latest encounter)…………………………. You meet a boy and you think he may potentially be a man. You start having sex with him right away (big mistake). After a couple of months you finally start actually going on dates or as boys probably think of them as a precursor to sex (even bigger mistake). You continue having sex and going on dates and hanging out with him and his friends. You usually see each other 4, maybe even 5, times a week. The whole time he is hot and cold with his affection, especially in public. Boys, that just gives me the impression that you are always looking for something better and don’t want to seem like you’re unavailable if that (what you might think) “better thing” comes along. I have to tell you……that’s the wrong way to do things. So, you continue this way for about 8 months all the while asking him what is going on between you (his classic answer, “I don’t know!”). You can tell he really likes you (at least you think he does), but you can also tell you’re not the only girl he’s seeing. So, finally, after 8 months of not knowing and only hoping, he finally answers the question. “I really can’t see things going any further, because I’m not big on the kid thing. I really like hanging out and having sex, but it will never be any more than that.” What the hell am I supposed to do with that?? I mean, come on. You already let yourself fall just a couple of months before that dreaded answer. What a waste of time. If you don’t like kids, be a man and say the shit (pardon my French) up front. At least then we can blame ourselves when we decide to continue even though we know it isn’t going anywhere. Just because the girl is a good piece of ass doesn’t mean that’s a green light to let things go as far as possible without telling her how you really feel. Have a heart. All women, as well as men (even though they’re too pussy to admit it) have feelings and fall just as fast as the other one does. So don’t tell me that women fall too fast. That’s not going to cut it. I guarantee guys have broken up with girls just because they’re too much of a bitch to admit their feelings for her might just be more than they can handle. You would think women who are sought after on a daily basis would be much more selective in their choices of MEN (or as they turn out…..BOYS) that we date. But, I guess we all have our dumb days. Oh, and guys (this also goes for us ladies)……Let me give you a little hint. Don’t be afraid to express your likes and dislikes. When you’re going out to eat and your girl or guy asks you what you want to eat…..don’t say, “I don’t care. What do you feel like having?” Have your own preferences. Girls really don’t like guys that they have to make decisions for all the time. That goes for guys, too, ladies. Don’t be afraid to say how you feel. “Say what you feel and feel what you say.” It really works. That’s how I do it. Guys and girls who just go with the flow……..honestly, they’re just boring to me. I like to be spontaneous, but I like to suggest things to do. Honestly, it’s like pulling teeth just trying to find out where in the hell to go for dinner or what to do afterwards. You need to start speaking your mind. I guarantee 99% of us aren’t mind-readers. My dad does that to my mom all the time. He just expects her to know what he is thinking. How are we supposed to know if you don’t tell us?!?! My biggest pet peeve is when I ask a guy what he wants to do that night and he says, “I don’t know. What do you want to do?” And then I make a suggestion and he doesn’t want to do that. Come on guys…….where in the hell did the romance go?? I guess the last few generations have skipped that and gone straight to sex. Take us out to nice dinners. Take us for a walk in the Old Market and buy us ice cream. Use your imagination. Variety is the SPICE of life……….to be continued …………..

      Okay, okay……So, I have neglected my diary. But, I have really been that busy. So, where were we????????? Oh, yes…..I remember now. My volleyball team consists of Alana, Jake (Alana’s ex-boyfriend), Kerry, Jason, Travis (my ex-boyfriend), and myself, of course. What a team we are…..yeah right!!! So, the tension between Alana and Jake is getting worse each week. There isn’t any tension between Travis and I. I just decided (even though things were wonderful) that I couldn’t see him anymore. I do have a great reason, though. He told me he wasn’t big on the kid thing. And I’m not going there right now. Maybe later. We played 3 games and won all three. My team rocks!! But, I was injured in the midst of winning those games. It hurt really bad at first, because I heard my wrist crack. But after the initial shock wore off I was fine. I continued to play until the end. Jackie called me and begged me to pick her up, because she was sick. So, I drove from 72nd & Q to Bellevue and all the way out to 60th and Ames to get her. When she got in the car, she looked terrible. I made her call her sister, because she had been avoiding her mom and sister’s phone calls for days. They started arguing, so Jackie just hung up on her. A few minutes later she told me she needed to go to the hospital. I called her sister and her mom told me to bring Jackie home. By the time I got her home she could barely even walk. I had to prop her up so she could walk to the front door. We went inside and as soon as we got inside her mom just started screaming at her. It was horrible. “You’re not sick, Jackie. Get up. You’re just trying to make me lose my job. I’m not taking you to the hospital. What kind of drugs are you on anyways? I know you have been drinking.” It went on and on and on all the way to the hospital. Oh, and by the way, I finally talked her mom into taking her to the hospital. We took her to UNMC, but they had multiple traumas coming in, so they sent us to Clarkson. They admitted her at about 2 a.m. The kids were wired from drinking pop in the waiting room, so they didn’t go to bed until about 3 a.m. In all that chaos I forgot about my own injury…….And, boy, do I wish I didn’t.

      This week has been absolute hell so far. I just can’t imagine it getting any worse. Monday- I just stayed home and did laundry, cleaned the house, and worked on improving my website. Of course I spent time with my kids. They are my life. We watched a couple of kid movies; “Hulk” and “Holes”. We played with the game boys for a little while. When 4:30 came, it was time for mommy to take a shower and get ready for work. When I was done getting ready for work, I gave the kids a bath and got them ready for the sitter. I dropped them off and went out to eat at Jade Palace with Jackie (I’ll tell you more about her later). Then we went to Walmart and I spent about $300 on groceries. It was close to 8:30 at this time. So we went home and put the groceries away and I was on my way to work. I didn’t get to work until about 10:00 p.m. I had to pay $75 to work. I’m lucky I’m optimistic or I never would’ve made the money I did that night. So, let’s just say I had a great night. Tuesday- I took Jackie shopping for school clothes. We went to Westroads, but we really didn’t find anything that either of us liked. It seems like they’re bringing back the 70’s vintage look. It just doesn’t do anything for me. The only thing I bought on that shopping excursion was 3 belly button rings. I couldn’t believe it. I never leave the mall with less than $300 in purchases. Jackie didn’t buy anything. We went home at about 4:00 and I was just pooped. My friend, Alana, watched the kids while we were gone and was more than ready to leave. ;-) I showered and got ready for volleyball. But, before I could go to volleyball, I had to go pick up Jackie’s aunt and bring her back to my house to watch my kids. So, my tragic night begins………….

      I had a pretty busy weekend. Friday night I went to the Golf Classic and had tons of fun. They had a live band and all kinds of people from all over. It was way too expensive, though. They charged $10 to get in and then you had to purchase tokens for beer. You could get 3 tokens for $10. That's more expensive than going to a regular bar, even more expensive than a stripclub. But, we paid it anyway. The guys there were too funny (well at any bar or party). They just stood there gawking at all the women as they walked by whispering little comments to each other about how hot we are. Unfortunately most men are alike. When they look at a beautiful girl, they instantly think about how bad they have to have her. I always know guys' agendas, so I shoot them all down. I get it at work all the time, too. It's crazy. Saturday I went to the pool with my friend, Alana. Then Saturday night I was going to go to work, but my friend Dawn came to town from Lincoln and begged me to stay home. After a while I finally gave in. I met Dawn and her boyfriend and his friends by Ameristar. They wanted to go to the Music Meltdown they held at Mount Crescent. What a joke!! We drove toward Des Moines 30 minutes outside of Council Bluffs. Then, we realized we were going the wrong way, so we turned around and headed in the other direction. This time we went 30 minutes out of our way toward Sioux City. Then, we finally found it after driving the wrong direction for almost 2 hours. When we got there, there were only about 20, maybe 30 people there. So we stayed for about 45 minutes to an hour and left. We went to my house so I could change and they could drink a little. Then, we went down to Cactus Cafe downtown. That was a blast!!!!!! I had so much fun! I always dance on the stage, because I have a problem with guys groping me when I'm on the dance floor. I just feel like I truly have my own space when I'm on the stage. When I'm on the dance floor sweaty bodies are bumping into me and guys are continuously trying to dance with me. When I go to the bars, I go to get my groove on (dance), not get laid like most people go to the bars for. I actually did a couple of dances for some bachelors that were there who recognized me. It was pretty fun. Tonight I worked. That was okay, I guess. I made a little money. I just get so frustrated sometimes. I ask people if they want dances and 8 times out of 10 they say this exactly, "No thank you, but you're beautiful though." Come on now. If I had a dollar for every time I heard those exact words, I'd be rich. Dancing can be a very difficult job sometimes. Sometimes I just don't have the patience to ask everyone so I can get those yesses that I need. I definitely have not-so-good nights. I just wish they were all as good as my great nights. Then I would not have any reason to quit........to be continued.....................

      Today has been a pretty busy day. I just started my new class. It is "Introduction to Effective Written Communication." What a bullshit course. But, I guess it's just part of my requirements. I get to take a new class every 6 weeks. If things go well, I will finish with a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice in a little under 2 years. I haven't been to school in almost 8 years, so this is all very overwhelming for me. I got a "B" in my first class. I will get an "A" in this class. I'm really excited about the next two years. I'll keep you posted on my progress. Today I had to write a bio about who I am, where I come from, what I do for a living, my family, and what I do for fun. What a joke! Most of the people that are in my class (online) have traditional lives. They have the mommy, the daddy, the children, the 8-5 office job, and they eat dinner together every night. But me.......I'm a stripper who works late nights, I am a single mother of 3 children, and I eat dinner in my car most nights. And for fun.........What fun? I have hardly any time for that. I play volleyball on Tuesday nights and I love to do lots of other things, but I just can't find the time to do it. And, now my bio is complete.   I went to the gym today......I can't tell you where I work out, though. I worked out my legs, my butt, my back and my shoulders. Working out is so exhilerating to me. I love a good workout. I'm even thinking about doing a photo shoot while I'm working out.....What do ya think?!   And the rest of the day was filled with the children, of course. To be continued.....................

      Hello everyone.... I have been having some problems with my message board, so I guess we have to start all over again.  I decided to do something different.  I am so glad you followed me this far.  I think you will love all the changes that will be coming up in this month alone.  i decided to start keeping somewhat of a diary so you can read about the things I like to do and have to do on a daily basis.  You can interact with my diary as well.  Today will officially be my first entry.
