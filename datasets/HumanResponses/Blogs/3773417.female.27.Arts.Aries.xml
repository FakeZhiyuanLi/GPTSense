      There was a Princess. She lived in a city where good things didn't happen too often anymore. People were mean to each other just because they weren't alike and they started doing nasty things to one another. The Princess prayed to God for people to become smart...and waited. That didnt happen. She prayed to God for people to become happy...and waited, but that didn't happen. So the princess gave up, thinking that God was busy somewhere else making some other princess happy. She was sitting at her computer, unhappily trying to work when her phone beeped. An sms from a friend to meet up for coffee. She smiled at the thought of seeing her friends. All the troubles suddenly became less. The city seemed happier. People seemed nicer. She picked up her bag. God Smiled.

      I don’t think I ever intended to become a designer. My dream evolved from the usual- being a doctor. To being a Literature Teacher. And somehow life led me the gates of the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture. In hindsight I look back and try to find something common in all the career ideas I went through. The underlying streak seems to shout out that I wanted to do something that could make a change. Even in domino effect.  Some people are born great. Destined to make cataclysmic changes in the world; but much more powerful than them are the silent greats. The ones who go about living life with hard work, dedication and a joie de vivre. These are the people we learn our life-lessons from. They affect one person and the chain reaction starts.  That way they affect the world. That is who I want to be. To go about my work with a passion that does not need to be screamed out from the rooftops but felt by the people who I meet and work with. Who sense in me this spark to make the difference.  All this I found rolled into one when I studied to be a designer at college. I was a doctor; I could heal with colour and design. I was a Literature teacher; I could find inspiration in words. And I was a communication designer; I could TALK to people. The moral behind the story being that one really does only need good intentions and everything has a way of falling into place. I got all my intentions packaged together in a career I had not envisioned for myself even at the end of my first year at college. But looking back today, after four years of design, literature and life, I see this as a life calling. How can it not be?   Outlining the kind of person I have grown into, the need to experience is paramount in being able to keep designing and not fall into a rut. If I am going to influence peoples’ attitudes and sense of being, then I want to see what is happening everywhere. Only then will I be able to make a continuing lifetime commitment to this kind of inspiration. I want to hear because only then will I move a step forward and be able to say something too. I want to meet other people who are different from me so I can be a new me too. The day I stop wanting that is the day I should retire because in my line of work, what we do is grow. We reach out to the world in large and being the patriot that I am, I would love to bring back that knowledge of the world to teach and learn from it in my own individual way. And maybe then one day, I shall be one of the silent greats too.

      i&nbsp;started playing this game with myself some years ago.&nbsp;i would suddenly one random day try to think back as to exactly what situation in life&nbsp;i was in a year ago today. And then&nbsp;i would try to imagine how different next year this time would be in my life. there was a point in life when i wrote every single day in detail. i would write about what i wore, how it made me feel, what impact someone one comment had on my day, who said what to me. oh yes, i had a log of my life in painfully excruciating detail. sometimes when i read back, &nbsp;i actually find myself wincing at the whims and fancies on which i have lived my life. and at other time i find myself laughing at the sheer variety of experience ive managed to capture in my daily ramblings to myself and God.&nbsp; but&nbsp;over time the quantity of the writing decreased and i would like to believe the qulaity increased as i became more selective in who and what even deserved a mention in what i wrote. nevertheless, i still play my game. to keep remembering how far i have really come.&nbsp; last year this time, i was burnt out. work was crazy. summer was not just summer-like and there wasnt a hint of magic on the horizon. i was emotionally and physically exhausted from my project deadlines, from my&nbsp;cousins second wedding, which took place amidst intense drama (but happy ending eventually) and from the sheer routine i felt myself&nbsp;falling prey to helplessly. i had no idea my life was about to take a twisting turn. looking back i can see myself, harassed and tired, thinking that august will herald more work as the school semester would start and i would go back to teacher mode. i can see myself tired. i can see myself ready to just keep bobbing along in the sea of work id surrounded myself in. i can see myself teetering on the edge of a collapse. little did i know last time this year that the second half of the 2003 would turn out to be a small miracle. little did i know that in store for me was the adventure of a lifetime. an 8-week journey that would begin some of the biggest changes in myself. &nbsp; But now looking back, i smile. i smile at&nbsp;my&nbsp;short sightedness at that time, so unhappy or so content&nbsp;in&nbsp;my "now" moments. i smile as i remember how unsuspectingly i was doddering around, when the chance of a lifetime landed in my lap... and now today as i sit and write this blog, i smile and realize that this time next year, when i&nbsp; look back, i will have&nbsp;even more to smile about.

       pretty much the haalat of the brain currently. can take too much. feel like hanging a "handle with care" sign around my neck- because it seems like anything...just about anything could be the proverbial straw. one day im as solid as a rock and then suddenly im as fragile as glass. one day im a creative genius and then next day im as dry as thr sahara desert. as much as being an extremist is part of the arien perosnality, i would like nothing better than to float the mere mediums right now. to not feel the extremes that im used to joyriding on. id love to, for a short while, be a passive numb neither here nor there kind of an existence, then the galloping highs and the burdening lows of life have evened out out somewhat to a more trotting pace- i feel liek just tossing on the seas for a bit, ending up whereever the winds take me, for where i was, i no longer care to be and where im heading i no longer have the burning desire to know. for a while, ill happily bob along the ocean of oblivion. not knowing. not caring. not needing to. happy in the indecision. content in the abandoning of all powers, both negative and positive and at peace inside with the knowledge that i did my best.

      Somewhere in the fourth year of my career, I should now be a seasoned professional.  One who looks at the client in the eye and wondrous eloquent persuasive words roll off my tongue as easily as my name. Sara Jamil. Sara Jamil. Jara Samil. Hmmm. Why even today do my knees knock(not that you can tell)? Why even today am I thinking if i even understood the brief well? (when i should know I did) Why (right now) am i sitting doing night duty and fretting about what could go wrong when I pride myself on being able to conserve all positive energies into working their magic for me?  I know i can knock their socks off. I know i can make them listen. Really listen. And think. I just know that language well by now. I should, right? I  know  the work. I  know  my job.  The last couple of lines kind of render this blog useless doesn't it?

        Macromedia Freehand 10 has 99 undo's   The option (ctrl Z) is rendered void after a certain number of forward moves made, the number depending on the kind and type of software being used. Much like life. Sometimes life gives you several chances to undo what you have done.  Sometimes not even one.

       i love august. for me it marks the beginning. the weathers great. i love karachi in the rain, not too much of it but enough to keep the air smelling fresh. i love the energy that infuses everyone, as the negative thoughts are washed away by monsoon showers and replaced with a spring in the step and a smile on the face. i love august because it has always marked the new year at school, when you head back with an anicitpatory butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, thinking of all the great plans ahead , all the new people you will meet and all the thigns that can happen. i love the air loaded with possibility as though something wondeful is right around the corner. i love the way tiredness shakes itself off me when the rain starts and the clouds gather. i love the way i am reborn. ready to tackle the rest of the year with a headiness even chocolate doesnt bring...
