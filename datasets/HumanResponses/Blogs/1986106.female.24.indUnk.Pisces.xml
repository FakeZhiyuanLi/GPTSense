      Yes, it's another cold day here in Kentucky.  I had the debate of whether I should pull out the winter jacket today, but I opted for the jean jacket in hopes of the day warming up.  Work is quiet today with me being the only person in the office.  I really haven't had much to work on at the moment, but somehow I managed to fill the hours with stuff.  I seemed to have perfected the art of passing hours at work...I think I learned the most from working the post office in the summer at Transy.  At least I get a lot of random things finished.    So, I have talked about it yet, but I must vent.  I have spent the summer in anticipation of the new bachelor with the lovely Bob.  And if I am honest, I must share that I did email in an application to be on the show myself.  But, how disappointed was I last week! Mr. Bob kept all the girls that we wanted to get rid of and the future previews just show pure trash to come.  I was expecting more from Bob.  But of course I will continue to watch to see what the next dreadful episode unfolds.

      Well, I am excited to hear that quite a few people are reading this blog.  Today is a COLD day in Lexington.  What's the deal...it is fall..not winter yet.  Even though it is Monday once again, I did have a good weekend.  Friday night I went out to dinner and a movie with my lovely roomies, Lisa and Bridger (not listed in an particular order:-).  I helped them procrastinate from studying for their pharmacy exams, or we can reframe it to I assisted them with refreshing their minds so they could study better.  We watch   "Under the Tuscan Sun"  which was wonderful, and I give it five stars.  I admit that it is "a girl movie", but it was not just the typical love story, but rather the plot was more about a women's search for independence and happiness in the beautiful Italian countryside.  And, yes, I now want to move to Tuscany, or at least go visit it..shocking I know.:-)    Then on Saturday after watching the sad UK game, Kathy (close friend from home) came to visit from the weekend.  We just relaxed and hung out at the house.  It is always nice to catch up with Kathy and to hear about her teaching adventures.  Then I worked last night with the kiddies at mental health facility, which was an adventure as usual.  Have you ever had a small child climb up your chest and do a flip?  Funtimes in the mental health field.  Speaking of mental well-being, I finally went to the doctor to see about the number of funky symptoms I have been experiencing, and while the verdict is still out as to what is going on with me, they seem to think it has to do with my stress level.  Suppose I need to work on those stress-relieving coping skills of mine.  Oh, well...have a wonderful Monday everyone.

      Well, it's Friday!  As I woke up this morning, I as already counting down the minutes until I will get to crawl back into bed and take a nap this afternoon.  Luckily, I don't have to work much this weekend, just one shift on Sunday evening.  I am going into work today, but it's just for cross-training for an assessment position(which I am excited about).  One thing I have had trouble adjusting to this past 3 months is having to look "professional" every day of the week.  This summer has not been that bad because I have gotten to wear my sandals, but fall is now here and today I had to break out the "winter shoes".  Women will definitely understand how difficult it is to find comfortable dress shoes that also look cute, or even decent.  So, today my feet are already hurting after 1 hour of being arched and squeezed tightly into my boots.  Oh, well, I just need to make it until 3, I can do it.   Enjoy your weekend.

      Well, I have been debating starting a blog for awhile, and I have finally decided to start one today.  I am not sure if anyone will actually read this, but I am thinking that this is my way of trying to stay in touch with everyone that I don't necessarily get to speak to each day.   I bet that Josh (i.e. "my best guy friend josh"..his official title) will read it, but he is about the only one that I really think will.   Today is a dreary, cold day in Kentucky.   I am just sitting at my assitantship passing time and at 3:00 I leave to go teach my parenting class at the counseling center where I am doing my practicum.  For those of you who don't know what's been happening with me, I am currently finishing up my master's at UK in counseling psychology (studying to be a therapist and no my clients do not lay on couches) and working on the side as usual.  My assistantship involves me following legislation..or least I am learning how to do this and I am working at the same mental health facility with the kiddies and teenagers.  Have you noticed that I am being vague about locations?  Something about this being on the web for anyone to tap into makes me want to not disclose places, specifically mental health facilities in which I work.   I should go pretend like I am doing some work now. :-)

      So..yeah another Monday here in Kentucky.  I did have a great weekend though.  I went to Philly to hang out with Megan and Caitlin and had a wonderful time.  It was so great to just to get out of Lexington and not think about everything on my plate for a little bit.  Visiting somewhere of course makes me want to move:-)  I often crave the newness of a different place and new experiences.  I flew up and the flights all went well..except for the last flight made me really nervous.  It was one of those little jet deals that only holds 30-34 people.  They first come on there and tell us that they need three volunteers because the plane is too heavy.  Then they start trying to balance us out by telling people to go to the front or back, etc.  I am like, for the love, nobody move because we may tip the plane over!  Then the lovely loud jet sounds all the way to Lexington did not help my uneasiness.  Nevertheless I made it back to Lexington safe and sound and I am starting the regular routine of my weeks.

      Funny story:  So, I am amidst my hectic Thursday and just completing the parenting class when an unfortunate accident occurs. As I am pulling out a study guide for one of the parents, I manage to paper cut my eye...not the eye lid, the actual eye.  (As I am telling you this you probably have grabbed your own eye in pain and then began to laugh).  Yes, and if you think a papercut hurts on your finger, you don't even know the half of it.  It was very, very painful and I had to lay with ice on it for 45 mins before I could open it.  Yes, so the story of my life....always finding away to do the impossible.:-)  Have a good weekend.

      Thank goodness it's Friday and thank goodness I actually get a weekend off.  So, it is a dreary day here in Kentucky.  This morning at work I have found myself staring out at the window quite a bit and some how finding things to distract me from productive things that I could be doing.  I am amazed at home much time I can make pass do odd end things.  My current debate of the moment is how personal to go in the blogs.  As most of you know, I am a very open person, perhaps too open sometime.  Yet the thought of writing some of that on this blog is unsettling to me.  Perhaps it's the fact that it's just out there and anyone could read it.  I don't know...to disclose or not to disclose...that is the quesiton.

      O.k., so over the years, mainly since I went to college, I have had the debate with people over the color of my hair.  When I was younger, my hair was red, and I was called nicknames related to this growing up.  People from home still refer to me as having red hair, but my newer contacts claim they can see no red whatsoever.  Why am I bringing this up?  Well, a few minutes ago a lady I have just started working with made reference to my "red" hair.  Yeah, so another point for the red team.:-)

      Well, I suppose that the busy-ness of my life has caught up with my blog writing now.  Somehow I managed to work 20 hours this past weekend.  Exciting times there as usual.  I am still a bit sore two days later from breaking up a fight of two patients.  The current debate is whether or not I should take a "leave of absence" from the mental facility for a month or two so I can alleviate some of the stress in my life.  I actually had a class cancelled this weekend which I am mucho excited about...will I actually have time to go to the grocery store??  I found a cool job in northern Ireland looking for someone with a master's in counseling...hmm..who would that be?  I am thinking of sending in my cv just for fun.   By the way, I did actually stumble upon it when searching the newspaper, I am not actively looking for jobs elsewhere, but if they fall into your lap..what does that mean?  I have started weight watchers again, so I am back to counting the points.  I understand that it works, but it gets so frustrating trying to figure out what, if anything, I can eat at a lot of places.  I suppose one realization I am having this semester is that I have trouble doing myself the same things I am encouraging my clients too.   Have a lovely day.

      Each day, I am amazed that I am able to get up so early each day.  I mean, really the day I get to sleep in during the week is Wednesday and that's only till 8:00.  It is just not natural for me to be up so early.  Today I don't have any caffeine with me, so it will interesting to see how I manage to keep myself alert at my assistantship for six hours.  One thing I must admit that I miss from the good ole' undergraduate days at Transy is not having to worry about parking.  I mean jump out of bed, take a quick shower (or not..depending on the day:-) and you can be to class in five minutes.  I will be honest and say that I did complain about parking at Transy, but I now realize how silly that was going to a large university for graduate school.  Let's take a moment and compare:  Transy parking, $20/a year, and farthest away parking in MFA (i.e. about a 5 minute walk) UK parking, $189/a year, and farthest away parking could be up to 25-30 minute walk  Let's see.....yeah Transy is the winner. (Or, out of my college experience, Ireland would be the winner because I never had to worry about parking and simply walked everywhere)  I guess I shouldn't complain that much because I do luckily have an employee pass and most days get within 5 minutes of my building, but some days it is a 30 min or more search for one of these spots.    I spoke with Mr. Key Covington last night and sounds like he is just studying hard in medical school.  I feel like so many people I know are so busy and stressed this semester.  With staying so busy all the time, the hardest thing for me is that I feel so unconnected to other people in my life and that stinks.  Oh well, sorry that I sound so pessimistic today, I am just sleepy.:-)

      Yes, I have been a slacker with blogging..I have been told this by several people.  Even though I have taken this month off from the Ridge, I still have gotten trapped in the craziness of the end of the semester funk.    I guess the big news is that I have decided to apply to PhD programs just to see.  I figure if I am going through the process at UK, I might as well go through the process at other schools.  I am applying to six schools: University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, Temple, Boston College, University of Georgia, University of Texas at Austin.  I am not sure what order I would rank them.  Right now I am just hoping for interviews.  If I get interviews then I will begin to worry about where I would rather go and start telling more people about it.  And..if I don't get it...well then I will cross that bridge when I get there.  Good news...I did pass my master's exam.  So, in December I will officially be Jessica Campbell, M.S., or Jessica Campbell, BAMS (haha).  I went home for Thanksgiving and it was nice to be home for a few days.  I did absolutely nothing which was great.  I really don't know what else has been happening with me..Basically I am just trying to keep my head above water with the applications and school work.  I did beat my own personal record by writing a 6 and half page paper in 2 hours, specifically 6-8 am on the morning it was due at 9.  I know...I have to stop the madness...I am getting where I know just get stressed out after in it is finished.  So, that's the update on my lovely life.  I am going to go shower now and then do some more school work...funtimes I know.

      It's another beautiful day here in Kentucky.  I got up bright and early this morning to go get a screening to get my teeth cleaned.  They do it cheaply here on campus, so I am going that route.  Can you believe I haven't had my teeth cleaned at least since 1995 if not further back???  She said they didn't look that bad considering how long it had been..haha.  O.k....now random thought.  Anyone who knows me, generally knows that while in college I developed a fondness for the movie, "The Thornbirds".  Well, while driving last night I was having a moment as I was listening to some new sad song on the radio about the heartbroken and being in love and decided that love can really be summed up in the legend of the thornbird.  Being in love is one of the greatest feelings, but being heartbroken is one of the worst.  Yet, even though we suffer heartbreak, we still will search out for new love because there in nothing like being in love and feeling that love in return. (Hmm...yes I know you all know from whom I am heartbroken...frustrating that our hearts don't heal faster)  Anyways, here's the legend and something for you to ponder on today:   "There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth.  From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one.  Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine.  And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale.  One superlative song, existence the price.  But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles.  For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain....Or so says the legend." ---Colleen McCullough  Although..it is funny that I had this posted outside of my room when I was freshman in college...why didn't I have more dates? hahaha!

      Wow...what a wonderful day in Kentucky.  I went to Jacobson Park to study on this beautiful day.  As I was laying there on the blanket, staring at the sky (well..my intention was to study:-), listening to music, I realized how relaxing life can be when you actually slow down.  This is the fall weather that I love.  So, yeah, I have the master's exam coming up this Friday and I think it is safe to say that I am being to feel the panic.  It shouldn't be that bad, but I feeling overwhelmed with all that is on my plate right now. So, I told you that I had a wonderful time on my trip to Philly last weekend, but I thought you might enjoy reading the recap of the weekend from the perspective of Megan (it cracked me up!).: Meet up sportin' our going-out jackets--what else??, 5 alarm fire turn dance umpsha-umpsha, cab ride hell makes jess turn white (but luckily not yellow), 21er complete with classic sticky floor, bimbos-bumping, cheap drinks, awesome band (shaking head), short-man syndrome hits on jessica, wawa feast, "holdy toledo! now that'll wake up in the mornin'" shower, meg disappears into her shadiness for a while as jess and cait bond about how wonderful meg is and how she rocks their world, visit to "it looks like jess's, but uh, oh wait, no, it's meg-turned-country!" house, casey-conniption, teacher-talk, meg annoys younger sister cus she's a lil lost in what teachers are talking about, yum..food, meg turns her attention to this, more teacher talk, "A might wind keep blowin..blowin everywhere....." gets mysteriously stuck into our heads, vibrating chairs, WWIII visits for a moment in the backyard, buckley's night cap, making fun of vas's friends, extra hour yaya, aunt visit, meg comes late, but comes bearing cow juice, tour de philly led by rather clueless tour guide named meg, history lesson on um, where were we again---well something important anyway, meg and jess ride off into the sunset (well around 2pm) and we all live happily ever after....and all this and didn't once lose jess to the shoe-tying!! What a weekend! Hope you enjoyed the summary..I must get back to attempting to study now.

      Happy New Year's Eve!  It is that time of year once again.  I suppose I should write an entry in my journal because it seems to be one of the only two times that I write in it (the other being when I am traveling).  When I was younger, I would long for the days when I was old enough to do whatever I wanted on New Year's Eve, and now I wish I had an excuse to not have to worry about it.  I mean there is so much hype and pressure around it.  You are suppose to be somewhere "fun" (as defined by everyone else) and with "someone special".  It's like prom or something where you want a date, but you can't just pick someone random (luckily I didn't deal with that too much in high school because BC was a little different).  Everyone is asking you what you are doing and so suprised if you say you don't know.  When I was younger I imagined myself at a fancy party or in New York's time square.  Now I realilze that I would feel claustrophobic and be sickened by the smell of puke and urine in time's square and I am not to the point in my life where I know people fancy parties.  So, after putting off until the last minute, we have decided to simply stay in.  I am going to share New Year's Eve with some close friends here at the house.  We got some fun drinks and fun food..so it should be fun.:-)  Plus, you don't have to worry about the transportation and any drunken drivers or pedestrians that you might hit (haha..if you know the story...yes they know what I did last new year's!)  So, I am looking forward to a lovely evening with some close friends.   I hope everyone has a wonderful evening and I wish you all  Happy New Year!

      Subject: How to get paint off your car.  Yes, I should have known that going a whole year without doing something to my new car was just too good to be true.  I stopped to get gas before heading home (home as in Breathitt..the BC) for my mother's graduation the other day.  Well,  I pulled too close to the pump and as I left I side swiped the big gray things around the pumps making a lovely gray stripe down the side of my car.  (I also lost my debit card at the same stop and had to cancel it..but that's another side strory).  So, here is how you can effectively remove paint from your car.  There are primarily three methods that I utilized: #1: Simply using my finger nails (Warning: painful and hard to remove paint from the nails, yet nevertheless effective), #2 Take a scraper and wrap a cloth around it or use it bare lightly (Warning: can make new marks in not careful), #3 Use the sponge scrubby thing in the kitchen...my favorite approach (Warning: do not use it to clean dishes later:-)  Anyways, these three methods proved effective in removing the paint from my car, so I thought I would share.  Btw, my mother's graduate went well.  I very proud of her accomplishments.  She alsogave the speech and got a scholarship.  It was a cool thing to go to.  Anyways, I hope that everyone has a wonderful Christmas!  (I would write from the BC where I am going tomorrow, but it requires fighting with my sister for the phone line).

       "Sure, girls from NY, they are tough.  And girls from GA, they are sweet.  But those born and bred feisty Kentucky girls, they are the ones you have to look out for.  We have sugar and fire in our blood.  We can ride a horse, be a debutante, throw a left hook and tell you the entire UK line up all while making sweet tea.  And if we have an opinion, you get to know it.  We're both the pride and the downfall of the bluegrass." -Ashley Judd   How much do I enjoy this quote!:-)

      Just another manic Monday here.  I have been at work nearly all day doing odd end things.  The applications do appear to be coming all together somehow...thank goodness since deadline number one is December 15th.  I did school work and worked at the Ridge this weekend.  Work went well, it was actually a nice calm evening there.  Am I the only person who does not like to dream?  I tell you, I have been dreaming continuously the past few nights.  In ranges from me being on the Bachelor, to strange high school reunions.  I don't like dreams because I sometimes feel less rested when they are so vivid.  Oh..well!  Good news for spring break:  we bought our tickets to Italy!  How exciting!:-)  We will fly into Rome and out of Venice.  Oh how I do love Europe.  I think I  will go procrastinate and look for places to stay now...

      So, yeah I can't help but wonder what is going to happen with Trista and Ryan.  I am definitely a bachelor junkie.  I am addicted to reality dating shows.  Perhaps I am so intrigued by these shows because of the reality of my dating life..or lack thereof (haha).  Things are just busy here.  I feel like I do nothing but write papers lately.  What is sad is that I write all these papers, and half of the time I can't remember what I wrote the next week...or even the next day.  I have my cold again...what is it with me this winter?  I mean my immune system is not doing it's job.  So, I am back to my deep manly voice...when I get this scratchy throat thing my voice lowers for some reason.    For those of you who have been following Average Joe, what's up with this term "duff"?  I had never heard of it before.  I am often a good "friend of the girlfriend" as I describe myself, so I wonder if that is what I am viewed as. I hope not, but I couldn't help but think about it.  Anyways, I should go do some work.

      Subject:  What a weekend...and what a week so far...  So, I had an eventful weekend to say the least.  It all started on Friday...I went to a party of some school friends and then since Natalie was in town a few of us ventured out to Austin City.  I think Stacey coined it best by saying the bar was filled with two types of guys "frat boys and freaks".  Evidently it was my night to meet the freaks.  The first guy was this dude who never had had a girlfriend and worked at a toilet paper factory, second guy a teacher...who was lying about all kinds of things...third guy compulsively screamed obscenities at the band for no apparent reason.  Fun times indeed.  So then on Saturday morning I get up out of bed to take Bridger to work because her car was getting fixed.  I literally rolled out of bed...didn't comb hair, had yellow pajama pants on with green shirt and blue sweatshirt...white socks with purple sandles...and no bra.  So, what happens when you roll out of bed looking like this and when you have forgotten your license?  Of course...I get pulled over for speeding at 9 am in the morning.  I mean what punk of a copy is just sitting around on a Saturday morning trying to fill his stinkin' quota!  So, I got a ticket...and just had to go down town and get a new license.  Then the ice storm came...right when I had to go to work.  So, there I am..desperately trying to scrape ice off my car as my coat and hair become covered in ice as well.  Then...when I got finished with work that evening...I got to scrape my car again...all the while trying not to fall in the process.  Even the grass was slick!  You should have seen my simply trying to make my way to the door at home (and isn't so great that I had to drive on all this!).  Anyways, that was the weekend.  There are some school updates.  I heard a negative from University of Texas at Austin....sad because a warm climate could have been nice, but I did received an interview from University of Georgia.  UK is deciding tomorrow...so keep your fingers crossed.  Only problem is that I have all these stinkin' overlapping interviews.  I am trying to figure out how I am going to do it all.  Right now here is what is looking like: Wednesday: drive to GA, get on plane to Philly, Thursday: Interview at Temple, get on plane to GA, Friday: interview at GA, drive back to KY, Saturday: Nashville for the night.  Good grief!!!!!  But this is looking like the only way I can afford it and I really do now want to rule any schools out yet..the more chances the better.  And of course I must give credit where credit is due...thanks to the master mind of my dear friend Josh for helping me come up with something that may get me everywhere.  I will keep you updated!

      I am excited to know that there are several people reading my blog...so at least it makes me feel like I am not just rambling to myself.:-)  I enjoyed the nice long weekend.  I had a new realization when I dog sat for some friends on Friday night.  I have been wanting a puppy for quite some time now.  Well...I have now changed my mind.  The dog was adorable...but chewed on everything..including huge portions of my hair when I was lying down and woke me up several times to take him outside.  I could not leave him alone for even a second.  Granted the dog is still a puppy, but I don't thnk I would have the time to keep up with a puppy at this point.  It would be like being a single mother or something.   Why have I wanted a puppy?  Probably to help with feelings of loneliness.  It is funny how I stay quite busy and have all my friends, but I still often feel lonely.  The fact that it felt great just to dance with a stranger in a bar the other night definately confirmed that I feel lonely.  I don't think that I am unusual in this feeling though.  There is something about this age where it feels like I am caught in between my single friends and then those who have gotten married...or at least are in some type of relationship.  It is hard as the age of marriage is being pushed later, yet there is still that part of me that longs for male companionship.  It is just nice to have someone to ask about your day, care about you, and look at you that special way.   It is this strange thing.  Anyways, sorry if I have gotten a little too personal today.  At least I have decided that for now a puppy is not going to help fill that void.  I am not quite ready for anyone to wake me up when I don't have to be up yet!:-)

      Since I have gotten quite a few questions about what in the world I am doing this semester, I thought I would share about it on here.  As far as school goes, I did receive my master's this semester.  However, I now need 30 more hours of course work before I can sit for the state licensure.  Why do I need state licensure?  Well, if I decide not to go on to get my PhD, then I need the licensure for job opportunities and to counsel autonomously.  I also agreed to be in school for a full year when I accepted my graduate assistantship.  So, I will be taking 11 hours of coursework this semester.  I am taking three actual classes and a few hours of research and 1 hour of counseling to do trauma counseling.  As far as work goes, I will still be working at my assistantship in federal relations.  I have officially moved up to the assessment office at the mental health hospital where I work.  So that means that I get to work half the hours and get paid double what I was...I am very excited about that change.:-)  Good news about the GRE.  So I retook the stinkin' thing.  I was not looking forward to it, but I did study intensively a week this time and was able to bring up my scores significantly.  Much more that what I was expecting.  It was God's miracle for me this year.:-)  It totally was an answered prayer.  I still do not like the test, but at least I won't be scared that my score is the single thing knocking me out.  Now I am playing the waiting game with the schools and keeping my fingers crossed hoping that I will get interviews.   Anyways, that is the update on my life.  Have a great week.

      Subject: Brain dead  Hi..sorry I have been a slacker in the blogging, but honestly I am so mentally drained from the interviews and keeping up with stuff in between.  I do have good news to share though...I got into UK!:-)  So, I will be in somewhere next year.  I was suprised, I was expecting a wait list.  For all my friends who have already heard me rant, I will not repeat my thoughts about Valentine's Day.  My day was perfectly fine..I worked at the Ridge and make good incentive pay because no one else wanted to work.  However, I must note that the best I have heard it described is as "singles awareness day".  That it is indeed.

      Subject: Craziness completed             So, I survived the weekend.  The hectic plan worked and I was able to arrive at all my intended destinations.  As far as driving, the most difficult part was driving down to Atlanta on Wednesday morning because I was so tired.  I stopped multiple times, drank mountain dew, and even listened to some classic Bon Jovi in attempt to stay awake.  My first interview was at Temple and I feel like it went well.  Only difficulty involved my lovely pants.  So, you know how the zipper sometimes comes undone after zipped at the bottom part?  Well that happened, and in my attempt to fix the darn thing...I just made it worse.  Luckily I had a safety pin with me (always prepare for the worst!) and made a friend that helped me pin my pants.  Aside from that small trauma, they have a good program.  The interview was a tad stressful because we had to do a stinkin' role play for 10-15 minutes...pretty much I counseled a fake client in front of a professor making the decision of whether or not I should be in his program...nothing intimidating there!  Oh well, it went good...I think.  It could be nice to try living on the east coast for a few years.  I had a great time hanging out with Megan and Caitlin while there and hailed my first cab.    :-)             Flying back from Philadelphia I had a two hour delay which put me getting into Atlanta at 11:00...then I couldn't find my hotel...which was located literally 3 minutes away.  I tell you..yahoo directions is great for the long distance, but so confusing with local directions sometimes.  I finally asked some poor guy at the airport who directed me to the hotel.  I got there, go settled in for a whole 4 hours of sleep and got up to drive to Athens.  It was suppose to be 1 hour, 15 minute drive....well it took me 2 and half hours to get there.  Once I got there, it was raining and I couldn't find the building or where to park.  Finally, I called someone who helped me and I had to almost run in the rain and in my horrid heels to the building.  As soon as I got there..boom..it was time for my interview.  I really enjoyed my day in Athens.  They have such an impressive and amazing program there.  I found out they were ranked number 4 out of schools and that I had gotten an interview from 150-200 applicants!  I was just so happy to be there..and glad that I didn't know all that or I would have been too intimidated to even apply.  So in comparing the schools, I liked Temple,  I loved Georgia.  I must be careful to realize though that my comfort level may also be affected by Northern versus Southern cultural differences.               After all this was finished I slept in Atlanta for 12 hours and then headed to Nashville to meet Stacey, Staci, Ondi, and Natalie.  We spent the night there at the Hilton (very nice) and went to the George Strait concert.  George Strait is a good singer, but let's be honest....not the best entertainer..I actually was a little bored at the concert...sorry George.  We did have a great time though eating dinner and going out in Nashville.  Nashville has a very friendly and fun going out atmosphere.  So, now I am back in good old' Kentucky playing catch up this week with everything.  I have my interview at UK this Friday and then an interview at Louisville next Friday.  Anyways, that's my life in a nutshell.

      Subject: Another ticket.........  Well, you might be thinking, oh, Jessica already told us about the ticket, but oh no, let me assure you that this is another instance.  First thing on Monday, like a good citizen I went down to the court house and paid my ticket immediately..got my new license, etc.  So, I am driving home on Friday..end of the week....yet still the end of the month for those sadistic quota hungry cops..and I come to the intersection of euclid and limestone.  Now consciously I know that there is a little sign in the middle that says no right turn on red, but this does not always cross my mind when I get to that intersection.  This was one of those days when I didn't think about that, turned right and sure enough blue lights appeared.  I was like are you kidding me!!! So, yes I went 5 and half years living in this lovely city with no ticket and then I rack up two in under a week.  For the love, just give me a warning!!    Other than that things are good.  I am preparing for my back-to-back interviews this week and trying to get ahead on everything..which is sort of happening.  Anyways, do wish me luck on all my ventures this coming week.

      Subject: I am an idoit:-)  So, I figured out how the glade thing works...you shouldn't throw away the clip.  I looked the directions up on the computer and low and behold..there was a clip that I didn't have. I looked in the garbage...bingo.  So, now it is attached and making my car smell like rain shower.:-)

      Subject: What about that glade air freshener?  So, I have been slacking on the blogging again I suppose.  The past two weeks have been those types of weeks that seem to never stop.  I have just had continuous things to do and still have more to do.  The summer will be a much needed break for my weariness.  Things are good though..I got a scanner finally..I have been wanting one for some time.  I will scan my trip pictures soon and get a website set up..how fun will that be..at least for me I guess.:-)  I like for everyone to be able to look at my pictures.  I saw an interesting movie this past weekend..Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  It made me think a lot about those things we try to forget...and would we really want to forget them if we could?  It was a unique movie, but I think that I liked it.  No word from Georgia...I am on their "very short wait list" and I am feeling guilty for putting on UK.  I don't even know who I will chose if I get into Georgia too.  I am wanting to travel again since I just went..there is something contagious about traveling.  I have been looking at priceline and debating on bidding on a ticket to go somewhere in May.  It would be nice to just get away from things.  About the glade air freshener..I bought the one for my car the other day..it smells wonderful, but I can not for the life of me figure out how to make the think attack to my air vent...please email me if you know the trick!  Also, shocking news about Ireland.  So, we can't pass a smoking ban in Lexington, but they passed one for the whole country of Ireland!  Megan informed me of this last night and I was still uncertain until I heard in from an Irish man himself...so it's true.  I will go head off to job number 2 for the day now...

      Subject: Back to the real world...  Yes, back from spring break and entering a chaotic week here in Kentucky.  Italy was wonderful..once we actually got there.  Yeah, I haven't ever had so much trouble traveling before this trip.  Here's a quick summary of our Thurday (as taken from my journal:-): 1. plane to Cincinnati delayed because of "high winds" 2. oh, but the flight in Cincinnati is delayed too..jump on this plane 3. running through CVG in vain because we missed our flight 4. informed that they could not get us on a flight until 3 days later and placed in taxi to go to Lexington...and btw..Lisa's luggage went missing 5. Lisa works her magic on the phone requesting a refund and gets us on a plane that next day! 6. Taxi back to Cincinnati.  All of it was worth it when we got to Italy.  We had perfect weather...not a drop of rain, wonderful food (I really like the gnochie), and of course great sights to see.  We had terrfic hotels in both places..that were very reasonable.  Actually the hotel in Venice was amazing..it was a suite with a view of the lagoon.  Since we lost a day we decided to skip Florence and added another day to Rome and Venice.  My favorite part of the trip was Venice of course...I love that city.  I just love sitting in or walking down the back alleys taking the whole atmosphere in.   Everyone who knows me is aware that Ireland is my favorite foreign country, but so far I think Venice is my favorite European city.  Ladies reading this: for a self-esteem boost..just visit Italy.  Yeah, don't think I have been hit on or stared at that much in a long time.  The most random part of the trip involved us going out to a bar and dancing with some Italian friends we made at the photo shop.  They were nice guys who were kind enough to take us out and show us what they do for fun in Rome.  It was funny in the club though because all the songs were completely American.  The rest of the trip we were all..or should I say Lisa, was singing "give it to me baby..uh huh..uh huh"...definitely sets the mood for Italy..haha.  We eventually..or should I say that I switched to singing all day, "when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie..that's amore"..I probably have the words wrong.  Anyways, it was a great and relaxing trip.  Can you believe I actually didn't worry about anything from home for a whole week? Anyways that's a very quick overview of the trip...I have 13 rolls of film for those who want to hear and see more.:-)  I do love taking my pictures!

      Figured I would take a minute and update my blog since several people have been getting on my case about it (yes you know who you are!).  Things have been busy...even busy than usual I feel like.  The interviews and travelling got me behind on stuff for awhile...and of course staying busy means that I don't take as good of care of myself..so then I got sick.  I am feeling much better now..thank goodness.  I got some kind of nasty cold, my ears felt blocked up, and for some reason the left jawbone joint became sore.  I went to the lovely doctor though and she hooked me up so that I only have a fleeting runny nose.  I went home this past weekend (for my birthday..yes it is approaching...march 10....you should all run out and get me something)..and as my luck would have it..got flooded in on Saturday.  I didn't mind it too much because I did not really want to work that bad..but I am still not sure if my supervisor actually believed me.:-)  O.k., so now I will share the school updates.  Evidently Temple is not accepting any students this year.  The don't have enough faculty to support current students and the Dean of the Graduate School informed them that they could not accept new students.  A little frustrating for me because it was quite a fiasco for me to do all my interviews on one weekend.  So..no Philly for me...:-(  I have not heard from Georgia, but I am pretty sure that I am on their waitng list as they have sent declines out to other people.  Right now I am just chilling and waiting for Georgia's response.  I am just not even thinking for sure which I would rather go to..UK or Georgia.  It is a tough decision..so I am waiting to see if I even need to make the decision.  Only 2 days until I leave for Italy!!!  How exciting is that?  Perhaps, I will not return.  Do you think they would let me finish this semester out via email?  I think it is very possible...must think about this..haha.

Just more 12 more cavities to go..can you stinkin' believe that.  I will be so good about going to the dentist regularly after this.

      Subject: Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Yes, I have decided that this saying is true.  My latest example: white shoes.  Now, I am not sure if this an international or just American rule, but most women will tell you that you only wear white shoes after Easter until Labor Day.  As soon as I can, I get those white shoes out and really appreciate them.  It makes me happy to put on my white flip-flops with my outfit.  If we wore them year round (which would be silly because they would get extremely dirty in the winter) then it would take away some of the fun in wearing them.  It was nice last night because Lisa and I sat around and chatted about random things like we did all the time at Transy...back in those days where there was less going on..whether we realized it or not..of maybe we all just made more time to hang out..not sure..but anyways.  We got on the random topic of my lack of dating and my fears of if I will know what to say and do when and if I EVER get asked out.  Now, many of you will be laughing thinking..Jessica..you could  talk to a wall, but I assure you that this is a valid concern of mine.  I have no clue what I would talk about!  I mean really..this is a sad fact.  So, there are my random thoughts of the day. I feel like I need discussion about my blogs sometime..maybe I will set up a discussion on blackboard..haha.  I am going to go home and take a nap here soon...which sounds so wonderful to me at the moment.  Until next time...

      Subject: Those days when you should just go back to bed...  Yes, I had one of those rotten days on Thursday.  It was one of those days where nothing seemed to go right.  It began with me getting up...deciding that I was just too tired...calling into the dentist, skipping out on work, and then just getting to supervision right on time.  (Plus mind you it was pouring rain all day long).  First, I realize that I have lost my keys..keys to everything..car, house, etc.  I look everywhere..no joke I probaly spent 2-3 hours retracing everything looking for them.  Vanished out of thin air.  Then I lose my brush..which is a big deal because I rely primarily on one brush..and it is a brush that I have had for awhile.  Next, wouldn't you know that I lost my umbrella!  I mean really...for the freaking love who did I make mad?????Luckily Bridger and Lisa were home by the time I got there...or I would have no access to any of my keys.  Later that night I attempted to get keys copied..oh, but no..everything was closed. About midnight I did the smartest thing I had all day long..I went to bed.  My brush did reemerge before I left school yesterday and my umbrella appeared today..but still no keys.I must admit that this worries me because I lost my little clicker that unlocks my car..so essentially someone could go around clicking..find my car and drive off into the sunset.  If my keys still have not been turned in mid next week, then I will have to get the keys reset for my car, etc.    Clarification: "Shout out" to my neighbor. Yes, please note that Brett was not meant to be portrayed as a "bad" guy in the past blog by bringing up the topic of maintence low vs. high.  He simply mentioned the subject and of course my thoughts ran with the subject.  Shocking I know..haha.  So perhaps this entry will redeem me and clarify that I am not "shay-de".:-)

      Subject: High maintenance or low maintenance???  I decided to take a break from playing my game of catch up.  I had a wonderful weekend which involved NO school related activities or assignments, but I am indeed paying for it now. This weekend was so fun and relaxing.  I went shopping, went out to dinner several times with friends, went to the comedy club, and Keeneland.  I would love to be able to just reserve my weekends for fun activities, but I know this is not a reality.  This weekend was unique in that I didn't have to work..and as I have already revealed I am paying dearly this week.  I think the summer should be nice in only having the work aspect of my life and not having homework to complete in between everything else.    I had the trauma of getting my teeth worked on a Friday.  My mouth is still sore and sensitive days later.  I had to wear one of those lovely dental dams for nearly 6 hours...not fun times I tell you.  Plus the second time I was numbed it went all the way up my left side of my face including my eye...my..my..I was a lovely sight to behold.  It eventually was over..and it was worth my time getting paid to help my dentistry student with her boards.  I have many more appointments lined up this week to try to get my teeth all fixed.  I am dreading it, but the sooner it is done, the sooner I don't have to worry about it anymore.  It is official..I will be a UK for the next few years working on my lovely PhD.  No more worrying about it..but you know it would have been nice if UGA would have graced with some type of decision.  O.k. now to explain the subject.  I have been having the debate with several people about what it means for a girl to be either high maintenance  or low maintenance ...and which is better.  Poor Brett brought up this discussion..and I have given him a hard time for it, but it has resulted in some interesting conversation.  I have been described as low maintenance ..which I suppose I agree with.  I do not take a terribly long amount of time to get ready and I am not ashamed to be seen in my comfy clothes (that I change into immediately after hitting the door of my house) and bright purple sandals.  (Or..evidently not ashamed to get pulled over by the lovely police in those clothes..haha..)  The question is whether this is a good or bad thing.  Now different people say different things.  Boys..or I suppose they are men now..seem to say they like the low maintenance  but go for the high maintenance .  I have decided that all this doesn't matter because I am who I am...and there is no changing that.  I like to be comfortable when I want, take my shoes off where I want, but I like to dress up too...and do take care of myself.  Plus I shouldn't have to change for a man.  I hope one day to find my better half that appreciates everything about me..including my low maintenance  aspect.  I know that it does exist because I have experienced that in a relationship.  Anyways, that is my conclusions.  Ladies, be proud of who you are and find someone who appreciates either your high or low maintenanceness.  (Note: this is not to say that relationships don't involve give and take, but fundamentally the members of the couple should appreciate who each individual is).  Ok...That was a random tangent...but I hope that you enjoyed it..or maybe it at least made you think or laugh..or whatever.......

      I now know why I did not major in computer science.  I have been trying to get a simple webpage up for over a week now and have had no luck.  All I want is little thumbnail pictures..I mean how hard could that be?  Everything else on the internet seems so easy, but don't be fooled if you want to put up a website on UK's spot..you should be ready to work for it.  Fortunately Josh has been assisting me from Minnesota via telephone and internet in attempts to get this thing up....otherwise my computer would be out the window by now  Now I am back to square one and going to try to get the frontpage program to help me.  It's rain..rain..rain here.  I am looking forward to venturing home..putting on my new pajamas:-), doing the loads of the laundry that await me, and watching tv from my bed.  I have homework to do, but I can do that here tomorrow at work.  I love laying in bed under the covers when it is raining. (Perhaps that's the reason I slept so much in Ireland..that and the mono I suppose). I had a horrible counseling session today.  It just went on forever it seemed.  It has been awhile since I have had a session like that.  You know..essentially when boil down my job, I am simply an expert at asking questions.  Still no news from Georgia.   At this point, even if I get in Georgia...I think I will stay here.  Financially it is just the smartest decision.  There I would have to live by myself....moving cost..furniture costs...no guaranteed funding...no job yet.  I know that I could eventually get on my feet there, but I am sure that I would accrue more debt in the process.  Versus if I stay here...got a place to live...got two jobs...full school funding...potentially no more debt.  Really, it shouldn't be that hard of a decision for me.  The diet is coming along..I must keep focused on the goal of m y cousin's wedding.  I weigh in on Friday.  Will keep you updated on the website progress.

      It is a beautiful day here in Kentucky.  I really do love the spring time...it puts me in a better mood.  I am having trouble organizing my thoughts today.  As some of you may know or not, I am giving the whole weight watchers thing another try.  The ultimate goal is to lose weight for my cousin's wedding in September..so at least time in on my side.  It's just one of those going to be back at home....so want everyone to see you looking at your best.  Plus my cholestrol and high blood pressure will only benefit from diet and exercise.  Well, I did good the first week..lost 5 pounds..but then I went home for the weekend....and boom gained a pound back.  I am sticking with it, but can I just say that dieting is so stinkin' hard for me.  I mean for the love, going out to eat is a social activity, and if I want to stay within my daily "points" then places I can go are very limited.  Maybe I should get one of those surgerys...not really..I wouldn't do that, but it is frustrating.  I can't remember a time since I was like 13 when I was really happy with my weight.  I just get aggervated because it is a neverending uphill battle for me.    I am still itching to go somewhere and do something this summer.  I even just took a break just now and did a search to see howmuch a flight was..haha.  I should just get in my car and drive somewhere..how fun would that be?  I still haven't heard from Georgia...it's looking like it may come down to the deadline.  Honestly, I am beginning to lean towards UK...I think it just makes more sense.  (But then again I haven't always been one to rely on rational over emotional).  I am back in touch with an old irish friend, so that it nice to be back in touch (most of you know who I am referring to).  Anyways, I am going to make myself go to my lovely research methods class.  It's really not the professor..it's just studying about research methods in the evening...it just puts me straight to sleep.

      Subject: My name is Jessica, and I am a workaholic.  Sometimes I wonder why I push myself to work so hard?  This month is one of those times.  Last week I managed to work 46 hours alone..not including my 20 hour assistantship and clients.  I have discovered working that much at the Ridge doesn't leave much room for my individual clients.  Today I am still catching up on feeling rested...at least feeling mentally rested.  On this same note I watched the cutest movie the other night..Laws of Attraction (I mean combine sappy love story with a country I adore..Ireland..and of course I will like it:-)  Anyways there is a quote that made me think about myself.  "80% of women who say they are too busy for a relationship are really lonely".  Hmm....have to think about that one for awhile.  Josh is in from Minnesota for awhile.  Yesterday I spent most of the day hanging out with Key and Josh.  It was nice to have a down day and to catch up with them both.  Spending time at Key's house (i.e. Breathitt County North) tends to always spur interesting activities or conversation..and yesterday was no exception.  I now know that I have good reflexes, clean ears, and a hard to find heart beat.   Currently I am contemplating meeting up with a friend that I have made through email contact.  Yes, I suppose that is vague...ok..let's be honest I met him on match.com.  He has been about the only nice guy I have met and we have formed a friendship over the past few months.  I am thinking about meeting him for dinner...I will keep you posted.  I would love to rant and rave about politics, the unfortunate state of the world, etc., but that is depressing and I am pretty sure that most people are feeling dishearten, frustrated, and disgusted as I am.  Smoking ban in Lexington is WONDERFUL!!!!!  Went to Austin City last week and didn't even smell like a big ashtray...no need to take a shower before bed.  It was terrific.  Off to home to take a quick nap before working at the Ridge, 7-11 tonight.  Random hours.....  *****If you want to respond to the blog on the blog discussion, you can go to  urlLink Blog Discussion  Brett has already taken advantage of the opportunity to diss me.:-)

      It is all finished!  I am free from classes for the next 4 months or so.  I must admit that it hasn't set in yet...I still feel like there is something that I should be doing during down time.  This summer I shall be continuing more normal jobs, etc.  I have a bit more time scheduled at the Ridge so I can save up some money.  Apparently, I have a secret boyfriend...or at least that is what I have been told.:-)  My, my, how rumor can start.    Speaking of men, dating, etc., after spending some time with Chris, I have came up with a new theory.  Perhaps my problem with dating is simply that I am too independent.  Men seem to have the DID complex (no..not Dissociative Identity Disorder my fellow psychology colleagues) - they all want "damsels in distress".  So, I suppose that I need to start asking for more help.  But, the problem with this is that when you need some good male help..no one is to be found.  This especially becomes true in matters related to cars.  Anyways, just my latest theory on matters of the heart.  One day I should publish a book on all my theories.:-)  O.k...randomness, after requests of a few readers, I have set it up so that people can respond to blog entries, or general topics.

      It's looking like the end of the semester is here...one more final and I can rest my weary mind.  No academic reading for me for awhile.  Well, on a whim, I purchased a new bed last week.  Lisa had mentioned it to me...so I made an appointment and boom I got a new mattress set.  I had been thinking about it for awhile because my former bed was old...I bet at least 40 years old and had a faint stink of body odor.  I ended up purchasing a queen size pillowtop mattress.  It is heavenly...I want to lay in my bed all the time.:-)  Before I thought that a full and queen were pretty  much the same size, but my queen size bed feels HUGE.  I can stretch completely out on it without going over the edges (I suppose that isn't saying my considering I am 5'2".....).  Anyways..it just great...and my new sheets are soft...that is the second set I bought.  For some odd reason I accidentally bought horrible polyester sheets for some reason.  After being scolded and laughed at..I went to the store and got sheets that were 320 thread counts.  (Note: Evidently it is important to get sheets that are at least 200 thread count..the higher the count = the softer the sheets).  So, yeah..new bed and thanks to all who have helped me in the process of getting the bed, putting things together, and then helping me transport the old bed (i.e. "shout-outs" to Lisa, Brett, and Chris).  Weekend was ok.  It was nice because I met up with an old friend from high school, Jason Hale.  We had dinner and chatted a bit about our lives the past 6 years (yes..I am feeling old!).  I went shopping and nearly bought out Lerner.  As Josh puts it, that is a dangerous place for me.  I just want to buy and buy..luckily I had 30% off.:-)  And of course they gave me more coupons to entice me back once again.  The rest of the weekend I pretty y much just worked.  Saturday was soooooooooo busy at work..it was like walk-in hell.  I was there by myself when all these people starting showing up to be assessed while I am there alone.  I had to call my supervisor in and it was still so busy.  I was suppose to leave at 7..but that ended up being 11.  Needless to say I was  mentally drained from the day.  Last night I procrastinated once again.  I have really got to stop this.  I had gotten better with a few projects, but this project had just been put off.  Anyways, I got the paper written last night, presentation pulled together today, and now it is all over.  However I am VERY exhausted....I just want to go to be and sleep right now.  I honestly would not be so sad if my client cancelled.  It's my own fault though..this I know.  Now I must try to keep myself awake until it is time to leave work....

      Subject: The beach, first dates, and burglary   Yes, a lot of has happened since I last wrote. I went to the beach for a few days with Stacey. We stayed with her family in  urlLink Havelock, NC  and spent considerable time at  urlLink Atlantic Beach . Of course, I got burned. It has progressed from unbearable pain to excessive itching as it is pealing. (oh the things we go through for a tan!).   As I was writing this blog originally two days ago, I got a call from Bridger informing me that our house had been broken into. Evidently sometime during the days some jerks crow barred our back door and the guys next door. They took mostly electronic things from the guys and they took nearly all of Lisa's good jewelry. It's horrible and it just makes us all suspicious and feel unsafe at our own home now. Needless to say...a little after the fact we are all getting renter's insurance pronto. Lisa may be able to at least get some money to replace the jewelry under her dad's policy..just waiting to see. The police came, fingerprinted, etc...but as Lisa said "it's no CSI". They didn't seem able to get much.   First date...yes I met up with this guy that I had met through match.com. I would not have met him so quickly if I had not known he was not a psycho killer from a mutual friend. It went ok..it is so awkward at first and who knows what to talk about. I don't know quite what to say about myself. I think it went ok. &nbsp;He asked me out again for Friday..so I suppose I did not scare him off yet. Seems that I may have lost contact with the friend I made in Louisville. Don't really know what happened, I just haven't heard from him. That is really disappointing. Speaking of dating, women should check out this  urlLink article on dating ....it goes along with most of theory that seems to be going around by women in their 20's. Basically, men are not ready for relationships at the same time as we are and this results in a problem. I won't rant and rave all about this too much today..perhaps another time.

      Subject: A breakthrough and reason number 565 why I am in not a medical related field!  By sharing my personal breakthrough, I am not trying to depress everyone, but I am trying to use the blog as somewhat of an outlet for me to express my feelings.  While I know that all my friends would be more than glad to hear about my depressive insights..I do not want to depress them, so it is easier for me to share such things here.  The insight is in regards to my self-esteem.  Yes, I have low self-esteem this is not a new concept for me, but on Saturday night everything sort of came together for me.  I had received a new email from the match.com thing (yes I still trying to do that!) and I couldn't bring myself to email them back.  Mainly I didn't want to because I did not want them to see me...I am to the point of not liking my physical appearance that much.  I do not like looking in the mirror and quite honestly I am disgusted with my appearance.  If I do not like myself, how can I expect anyone else to?  Perhaps the reason I am not in a relationship, etc is because I am so unhappy with  myself in that specific domain of my life.  Anyways, it all just sort of came together for me with that realization.  Ok...on a funnier note..I am such a baby when it comes to needles!!!  I was helping out with a situation on the unit when I was at work at the Ridge yesterday.  While I was involved with the situation I had to help contain a child as he was receiving two shots.  After witnessing that I went back to the office and began feeling queasy.  I broke out into cold sweats, dizziness, and nausea..Eventually having to lay down right in the middle of the office.  Someone went and got me something to eat for my blood sugar and after 10 minutes I was fine.  I mean for the love!!  I had a similar incident in undergrad in Human Sexuality course when we watch the birthing video.  I guess me and needles and bloods just do not mix.  Plus...I know they can't find anything at the doctor...but my blood sugar sure drops a lot for there not to be a problem.  Going to the beach tomorrow!!  I am heading out with Stacey to visit her family in North  Carolina.  We plan to spend some quality time at the Atlantic Beach.  She needed someone to go to the beach with her..it's a hard job...but someone has to do it.:-)  It's off to the beach I go...

      Went to the dentist today......yuck, yuck, yuck!  It was bad today...I thought I was going to suffocate on that dental dam thing.  Plus..it hurt quite a bit.  My mouth is still sore...I am currently sitting with a pen in my mouth trying to deal with the aftermath of the dentist visit.  Currently, it looks beautiful outside.  I wish that I was laying out in the sun rather than in this office, but I assure you that looks can be deceptive.  I know that the lovely forecast calls for rain at some point tonight..as for the next week.  So..gave my number to the guy that I have been emailing, and I have heard nothing.  You know, I am just getting so frustrated at this love/romance thing.  I mean really does it have to be this difficult to meet and get to know someone?  I know that I have my flaws...I don't exactly look like a model and I can be loud at times, but am I really that horrible?  Anyways, I am getting to the point where I am just about to give up on this whole meeting somone and love will have to hit me on the side of the head before I notice it.  Oh, frustration!

       Rain, rain go away!!!   It is the stinkin' monsoon season of Kentucky.  The rain just keeping coming relentlessly.  If it was Ireland, I could deal with the weather, because I love that country..if it was the beach..I could sort of deal with it, but not in Kentucky every day for what seems like at least a month.    I went home this weekend for a few days..it was nice to go home for a bit.  It is so pretty there this time of year.  I have been dreaming so vividly here lately.  While I was at home I had trouble figuring out whether or not I had actually seen something on the news or if I had just dreamed it.  Evidently it was a dream because I couldn't find anything about it on the CNN website.  A little scary..haha.:-)  Update on the guy I have been emailing.  He was out of town when I was in Louisville and that was the reason he didn't respond to my email.  And for all you doubtful individuals...I really do believe him..and generally I am a pretty good judge of character.  He did ask if it is alright to call me sometime, so he has my number and I suppose the ball is in his court now.  I am just playing the waiting game...we'll see.  I suppose I should get into bed now and prepare for my morning of traffic school.  Before I go..you must check out the latest appearance of our lovely governor  urlLink Fletcher .

       Important note concerning earlier post:  I stumbled across that name being there..not naming roses after ex-boyfriends as one friend inquired.  ( I will admit that it does take my heart quite while to recover, but I am not that sad and lonely yet to go and name random roses..haha)  You will notice that the rose name is spelled differently..it was probably named for the singer by the same name.  Just wanted a clarification on that..

      Question: Why is it so hard to give up those favorite pair of pants?  This is something I often deal with when I get jeans.  I get a new pair that I love and I wear them over and over instead of wearing my other jeans too.  I noticed today that I am doing this with my favorite black jeans.  I have now sewn them up twice and they have a safety pin..yet this does not stop me from wearing them.  You really would think that it would..especially since part of the rips have been in the crotch..but oh no..I throw them on each morning..forgetting about the spots till I look down at work.  Ran into a random person from high school yesterday...Ralph Taulbee.  I am walking down the aisle at Target and I hear "hey I went to high school with you".  Random..

      Wow...i had a cram packed weekend!  The Country Stampede was fun and relaxing..with beautiful weather.  I even purchased and wore a cowboy hat for the occasion (pictures to come later:-).  We got to sit on stage for the  urlLink Chris Cagle  which was really neat.  This random guy approached us and was like to you want to sit on stage..we were like are you kidding!  At one point during the concert he turned around waved at Ondi and asked if she was looking at his butt.  It was hilarious.  I got waved at by the not so attractive drummer.  My dinner of a hurricane and funnel cake did not set so well on my stomach on the car ride back on Friday night.  Luckily I was feeling better by Saturday morning because I indeed had to be at work at the bright and early time of 7 am.   I worked on Saturday, took a nap and then headed back to the concert.   urlLink Martina McBride  and  urlLink Terri Clark  were great..they both had wonderful voices. After the concert I headed to Louisville to spend the night with Natalie.  With the lovely traffic, I beat Natalie to Louisville by an hour!  I sat in my car with the seat reclined sleeping until she got there.  It was great to get to catch up with Natalie..it felt like we hadn't talked in forever!  Now the lovely week has began again.  I am thinking I will go home for half of this week..I haven't been home in awhile.  My grandfather..papaw Jones is in the hospital right now though..and they are transporting him to Lexington today.  I am going to wait and see when they are going to do surgery on him.  He was mowing the grass and somehow the riding lawnmower flipped and he got crushed underneath him.  Keep him in your thoughts and prayers right now.

      Things have been busy here...shocking I know.:-)  Last week was another crazy week of working..like 45 hours at the Ridge alone.  I have not signed up for anymore weeks like that..I assure you.  I have been quite a bum in between all the working madness.  When I work that much, all I want to do in my free time is sleep and watch t.v. and essentially that is what my last two weekends have consisted of.  I enjoyed my Memorial Day very much...a day with nothing planned.  I went over for dinner and drinks at Lynda and James's..it was fun..that was two nights in a row that I actually hung out and relaxed.  I have completed my first project of the summer..I have completed my webpage.  Really, it isn't anything fancy, but I am quite proud of it.  You can check it out at this  urlLink link .  I guess since I didn't get to go to the beach at all last summer..I am trying to make up for it by going twice:-)  I am going with Stacey to North Carolina at the end of June and then two weeks later I am going to Cancun with Lisa.  Exciting times..maybe I will be able to get rid of this pale skin some.  I have a busy, but fun weekend scheduled.  I am going to  urlLink Country Stampede  on Friday...working..going to Louisville to visit Natalie (..and maybe the guy I have been talking to via email..not sure yet) and then back to work on Sunday.   Suppose I should motivate myself to actually do some work here today...  Btw...I figured out how to add commments to the blog directly, so feel free to comment on anything.:-)

       Not too much to report here.&nbsp; I went to a conference for school this past weekend...that makes the 3rd weekend in a row that I have been out of town.&nbsp; I am exhausted...and wondering what in the world was I thinking when I scheduled everything.&nbsp; I ate Tibetan (sp?) food for the first time.&nbsp; I enjoyed it..reminded me alot of Indian and Thai food.&nbsp; See...I don't think I am&nbsp;that picky of an eater.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had trouble staying awake during several sessions of the summer..made me worry about upcoming classes.:-)&nbsp; I am definately not ready to go back yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got back my pictures from Chicago and I am very pleased with many of them.&nbsp; Keep an eye out on my  urlLink website  for them.&nbsp; Maybe I should just pass up this whole PhD business and just take pictures.......hmmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Megan and Matthew...my&nbsp;brother and sister may be coming up tomorrow, so that should be good to&nbsp;visit with them.&nbsp; I am still awaiting the final plans.&nbsp;On a different subject,&nbsp; I have officially given up on trying to understand men...for the millionth time.&nbsp;

        Subject: Cancun, Chicago, and Bug bites      &nbsp;   After much time passing, I am now making myself sit down and update the blog.&nbsp; I suppose I will begin with my trips.&nbsp;  Cancun:  It was wonderful!&nbsp; I do believe that it is my favorite beach of those that I have visited thus far.&nbsp; Crystal blue water that you could see completely to the bottom of, large waves, and white sand that just feels terrific through your toes.&nbsp; Lisa and I relaxed on the beach, went snorkeling, relaxed on the beach, hit this cool night club  urlLink Coco Bongo &nbsp;(check out the website...it's a neat place), relaxed on the beach, did a bit of shopping....and did I mention relax on the beach?&nbsp; It was a&nbsp;nice trip and I&nbsp;of course&nbsp;got my nice red glow for a few days.&nbsp; Realized that I now need to say that I love Tex-Mex food...not Mexican.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;    Chicago : This past weekend I went to visit a friend in Chicago.&nbsp; It was fun times.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the&nbsp;first time I had been there so we hit most of tourist spots.&nbsp; It was opening weekend for  urlLink Millennium park  (yeah...a little late..try 4 years), so it was&nbsp;cool to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also hit Sears Tower, Chicago Institute of Art, the magnificent Mile, and Navy Pier.&nbsp; I made a purchase at bloomingdale's...nice string earrings and got the infamous brown bag to hold my purchase.&nbsp; I took lots o' pictures as always which I will post when developed.&nbsp; But all and all great trip.     Bug bites:  Yes, the story of my pathetic summer life.&nbsp; I am perpetually attacked by bugs each summer.&nbsp; All I have to do is walk to my car and they have a feast upon my ankles.&nbsp; I actually went to the doctor today because yesterday I managed to get nearly 15 bites all in the same area of my leg from just 15 minutes of sitting outside.&nbsp; The doctor confirmed they were just bug bites, so I am left with nothing that I can do.&nbsp; This summer seems to be worse than others...I am almost embarrassed to wear clothing revealing my legs because I am then forced to answer everyone's questions about what's the deal with my legs...then they don't seem to believe me.&nbsp; Anyways,&nbsp; hating the summer bugs that's for sure.    Love life:  Amazingly there is actually something to put under this topic.&nbsp; I have been continuing to see the same guy that I have been.&nbsp; I am not sure really exactly what's going on, but for now I am just seeing what happens.&nbsp; Men are just so stinkin' hard to figure out..that is all I am going to say.&nbsp; If I think too much about it, it will drive me up the wall.&nbsp;   For those of you reading who know my cousin Miranda...you may want to check out the engagement pictures that I took for her on my  urlLink website .

      Well, I had a wonderful weekend in upstate New York visiting Megan and Caitlin (and Vas of course...Meg's boyfriend). We spent a couple of days just visiting places close to Rochester and then the last day at Niagara Falls. I didn't expect upstate NY to be so picturesque, however it was really lovely. Just imagine green rolling hills surrounded by wine vineyards. And of course Niagara Falls was gorgeous. We did the Maid of the Mist..a boat that took us out to the edge of the falls..truly amazing. It is always great to catch up and spend time with the girls too..they crack me up. It was a great weekend getaway. So that puts an end to my lovely summer travels. School will begin soon....  If you have any free time, you should take this quiz at cupid.com. Of course it is extremely valid and reliable...yeah. The link to the quiz is  urlLink http://www.okcupid.com/oktest . Apparently, I am the  urlLink sonnet ....which I must admit is quite fitting. Another random thing...I am currently on a Chris Cagle kick. I love this  urlLink song... check out the lyrics.  I spoke with an old friend last night. Sometimes it is so nice to just talk to someone that you haven't in awhile. Just talking to them and hearing their voice brought back lots of happy memories. It was something I really needed last night. No comment on the love life for now.

       Well...I finally got my favorite  urlLink Chicago pictures  posted.  Things have been good here.  I have just been going to work and hanging out with friends in between.  I have under a month now until classes start...where did the summer go?  This weekend I am going to visit Megan and Caitlin in New York.  I haven't ever visited Niagra Falls, so I am flying in Buffalo on Friday and we are going to make a weekend of it.  I have been still hanging out with the guy.  All I really know right now is that I have fun with him and he adds spontaneity to my life.  I will keep you posted.
