       Before I continue, I just have to say that nothing has appeared in my pants "by accident" since I was three.  Onward . . .  The  urlLink Borowitz Report  has very good news:    OSAMA FOUND IN SANDY BERGER’S PANTS   War on Terror Over  The war on terror came to an unexpectedly abrupt end today as the al-Qaeda network kingpin Osama bin Laden was found hiding in the pants of former national security adviser Sandy Berger.  While lawmakers on both sides of the aisle celebrated the discovery of Mr. bin Laden in the former White House aide’s trousers, this latest episode left Mr. Berger, once again, with much explaining to do.  The former adviser to President Clinton said that his lawyers would not permit him to divulge how, when, or why the world’s most wanted man had found safe haven in his pants, but he did tell reporters, “It was an honest mistake.”  At the White House, President George W. Bush ordered an immediate and thorough search of Mr. Berger’s pants “to see what else might be in there,” hinting that the discovery of Saddam Hussein’s long-sought weapons of mass destruction might be at hand.  With the war on terror suddenly over, the White House was said to be casting about for another human emotion to declare war upon, with many speculating that the U.S. would soon announce a war on irritability or shyness.   Hee hee.

       Also known as the 9/11 Report.  We can have Commissions. We can listen to pundits. We can watch the politicians jockey for the high ground, and we can watch the fingers point anywhere and everywhere. I've listened to a lot of commentary and read a few points of view, and still we can't be sure that what happened that day could have been averted. "Serious intelligence failures" are only part of the problem, I fear. Because the reason 9/11 occurred goes far beyond 19 terrorists - both known and unknown - making their way onto commercial airlines with sharp instruments.  An aside here, though: why was it ever okay for someone to board an airplane with no luggage save for a box cutter? Have you ever, when you're packing for a trip, said to yourself, "toothbrush, floss, clean underwear - ooo! almost forgot the box cutter!" The CIA and FBI weren't the only ones experiencing serious intelligence failures.  9/11 stands as the most horrifying day in a long line of them - from the Beirut bombing, to the Cole, to our embassies in Africa. The hatred was there long ago and according to the report,   ...In this sense, 9/11 has taught us that terrorism against American interests “over there” should be regarded just as we regard terrorism against America “over here.” In this same sense, the American homeland is the planet. But the enemy is not just “terrorism,” some generic evil. This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat at this moment in history is more specific. It is the threat posed by  Islamist  terrorism —especially the al Qaeda network, its affiliates, and its ideology.  As we mentioned in chapter 2, Usama Bin Ladin and other Islamist terrorist leaders draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within one stream of Islam (a minority tradition), from at least Ibn Taimiyyah, through the founders of Wahhabism, through the Muslim Brotherhood, to Sayyid Qutb. That stream is motivated by religion and does not distinguish politics from religion, thus distorting both. It is further fed by grievances stressed by Bin Ladin and widely felt throughout the Muslim world—against the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, policies perceived as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim, and support of Israel. Bin Ladin and Islamist terrorists mean exactly what they say: to them America is the font of all evil, the “head of the snake,” and it must be converted or destroyed.   It is not a position with which Americans can bargain or negotiate. With it there is no common ground—not even respect for life—on which to begin a dialogue. It can only be destroyed or utterly isolated.    Emphasis added. (via  urlLink Wizbang )  Destroyed or isolated. Well, we've seen that they refuse to be isolated, especially since our conversion or destruction is their goal. So "destroyed" is our other option. Kill or be killed. How black-and-white.  So without endorsing pre-emptive war, the report seems to endorse pre-emptive war.  This is the world we're living in - the one we never hoped for, but the one we're stuck with, nevertheless. I imagine the many ways that statement "destroyed or utterly isolated" can be implemented.  And I'm afraid.

       Something.  Does it ever feel like there's just too much going on in the world? Times like this, I just want to hunker down and contemplate nothing more earth-shattering than good barbecue.  Along that line, the Love Of My Life (that's Captain Chicken Wing to you) and I went to Famous Dave's last night for ribs and beer. Now that's saucy, sauced-up happiness.  Some people are addicted to heroin. I'm addicted to slow-cooked pork skeleton slathered in Dave's Sweet and Zesty sauce. With a side of Texas toast.  It's a crazy world, so it's nice to find the yummy bits.

       Or as I call it, my occasional perusal of the  urlLink AlJazeera website .  How many news sites have an entire navigation bar devoted to "Conspiracy Theories"?  I go because I want to read other people's points of view. I want to know what they consider news. I want to see which way the spin goes in other parts of the world.  In Australia, I hear it turns counter-clockwise.

       I had a post, really I did, but when I pushed "publish" I got an error message.  Suckage.  Anyway, I live in Las Vegas, so time to time I'll probably comment on local stuff (other than the fact that it's insanely hot right now).  Our top stories today:  1) More drama in the Ted Binion murder trial  2) The Aladdin is defending their decision to evict Linda Ronstadt from the hotel after she dedicated her encore of "Desperado" to Michael Moore, which elicited a few boos and some tossed cocktails.  I don't even know where to start with #1. That thing's been a circus since the poor man was found dead.  As for #2? I'm still laughing - not because of what happened, but because of how strange it is. Someone makes a political comment on stage, and suddenly the people that run these vice parlors (let's not lie, folks) get all puckered and proper. More on that some other time. I'm off to get dinner.  Cheers.

        urlLink Seven Texas children found in Nigeria orphanage   I'm not a hate-filled person, really I'm not. But when I see shit like this, I want the offender turned into a red smear on the wall.   The woman, whose name was not released, took all the [foster] children in October to Nigeria, where a relative of her fiance lived. The children were enrolled in school and the mother returned to Houston about 30 days later. She went to work in Iraq in April.  But the children were later removed from school because payment for their tuition stopped and lived in a wooden shack. Nigerian child-protection authorities found the children malnourished and sick and moved them to an orphanage in late July.   She left seven foster kids to die, like some backwards assclown would put unwanted puppies in a trash bag and throw them from the window of a pickup truck, then went to Iraq? Why couldn't some of those hooded assholes have taken HER?   State officials will determine whether criminal charges will be filed against the adoptive mother, or if she should just be taken out back and shot, when she returns to court August 26.   Okay, so I added the bit about her being taken out and shot. Can't blame a girl for trying.

       How long can a man go on, traveling and bringing words of hope to his faithful, when he is riddled by disease?  Yesterday, Pope John Paul II made a pilgrimage to Lourdes, and spoke to the crowds who gathered to hear and see the man they believe to be God's representative on earth. There, visibly ill and weak, he said "my pilgrimage ends here." So today, I read another story with a headline "Pope Near End of His Life." And he very well may be. Based on his words at Lourdes, he may feel his body finally giving out, after years of hard schedules, an attempt on his life, and a struggle with Parkinson's Disease.   But every time Pope John Paul II is mentioned as 'frail,' I disagree. His physical health may be waning, but his will and his spirit are as strong now as ever.  I haven't always agreed with the Vatican, but I can take a moment to appreciate the essential goodness of this man. Whether his end is today or (if he surprises us again) next year, I can say a prayer of thanks that God gave this Polish priest as an example to the world.

        urlLink ABC News  can take their Breaking News e-mail service and stuff it.  I thought Breaking News qualified as  urlLink "Osama Promises to Kill Someone Really Important,"  or  urlLink "Another 100,000 Christians Killed in Darfur Since Breakfast,"  or  urlLink "Iran Hits Broad Side of Barn."   Nope. Instead, I get this:   The prosecution in the Kobe Bryant case has asked for an unspecified continuance to delay the trial.   The only thing I need to round out my day is a Scott Peterson update.  . . .  Okay. I just went to grab the ABC News link, and here's the top damn story:    Listening In  Jurors in Scott Peterson's murder trial heard taped phone calls between Peterson and his ex-mistress.

       . . . I address the previous post.  The denials are still flying (with the appropriate amount of prevaricating), but it all still breaks down to this: there was a tape in the possession of al-Qaeda. Footage of Las Vegas was on it. FBI experts deemed it was a surveillance tape, rather than a vacation footage tape to hide "real" target information, based on shots of entrances, valet parking, and certain interiors. A warning from the FBI in Detroit can be traced to our local FBI, and two Metro officers viewed the tape. A warning was not given to the public, though this tape proved Las Vegas to be an al-Qaeda target.  Still, the mayor claims this information never got to his office at City Hall.  Goodman said he would like to confront the prosecutor. "I'd like to call him a liar," the mayor said. "They're making it up. If there were danger, you can bet I'd be screaming it all over the media."   Gee, Oscar. In your own subtle way, you did just call the guy a liar. I think you're protesting a wee bit too much. The FBI thinks you did know the tape existed and brushed it off as having a "deleterious effect on tourism." And isn't "deleterious" a nice, lawyerly word? But go ahead. Saying "they're making it up" is much better than having to admit you 1) knew and chose to remain ignorant; 2) knew, weren't ignorant, but put financial concerns over public safety; or 3) never knew because you're deemed unfit to be in the loop.  Aside from that, if you took this knowledge (I know - if you had it) and screamed it all over the media, that would seem like a panicky and unmeasured response. I would hope, as the number one public official in Las Vegas, you would consult with others. Perhaps you'd work with the FBI to decide whether the threat was general or acute, try to discover the nature of the threat (car bomb? suicide bomber? hijacked small plane or helicopter?) and make an appropriate warning after you had more to go on.  Maybe I'm being a bit unfair: I can understand that the nature of the threat is rarely clear. Just as I've understood since September 12th that I live in a targeted city - the very nature of Las Vegas is an abomination to Islamo-fascists. But if the words "surveillance tape" were even whispered in my general direction, I'd want to know more. Damn tourism or civil liability.  If something here really does "go boom," regardless of the scale, our economy will be crushed. We live and die by tourism. If the tourists don't think we're safe, they won't come.  Now comes the interesting part, and I'd love to see research on this one. Let's get a focus group together and ask: "Knowing Las Vegas officials ignored or refused to view evidence that the city was under credible terror threat, would you be more likely or less likely to visit?"  I wonder.

        urlLink AP: U.S. Didn't Warn Las Vegas of Threat   Imagine my surprise when I read the first paragraph of this horrifying article:   A year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Justice Department obtained video surveillance tapes suggesting terrorists were targeting Las Vegas casinos but authorities never alerted the public as they discussed whether a warning might hurt tourism or increase the casinos' legal liability, internal memos show.   Authorities didn't warn the public for WHAT REASONS?   The mayor of Las Vegas said Monday he was never told about the tapes uncovered in Detroit and Spain in 2002, and had been assured by the FBI there were no credible threats against his city. "If I were told, I would certainly tell the public," Mayor Oscar Goodman said.   Well of course you would. You're the mayor of Las Vegas, and it's your job to make sure residents and visitors remain safe. That's your priority, right? I feel so much better.  Or maybe not:  One document quotes a federal prosecutor in Las Vegas as saying the mayor was concerned about the "deleterious effect on the Las Vegas tourism industry" if the Detroit evidence became public.   How about the "deleterious effect" on your elected position, you gin-swilling ass? You worried about that at all?  Never mind. At least you can count on the casinos to stay informed. After all, why would casino management invite disaster by sticking their heads in the sand?   Another memo states the casinos didn't want to see the footage for fear it would make them more likely to be held liable in civil court if an attack occurred.   WTF?   The [FBI] prosecutor said he later asked a Las Vegas police officer, who had seen the tape and flown to Detroit to help, why more wasn't done. "This officer told me that the amount of money that travels through Las Vegas on a daily, weekly and monthly basis - if something doesn't go boom, nothing is going to be done," he said.   "Go boom." What a cute way to talk about the death and injury of hundreds - maybe thousands - of people.  Of course, the mayor and spokespeople for the casinos in question (Excalibur, MGM and New York-New York) are denying all this. But the agent who found the tapes and brought them to my fair city's attention begged they be taken seriously, documented by e-mails to our local FBI office.   "While I understand your previously stated concerns that the mayor of Las Vegas, the local sheriff and others believe our indictment may temporarily have a deleterious effect on the Las Vegas tourism industry, it is unconscionable that any reasonable person would assert that anyone here possessed a cavalier attitude toward the tape," Convertino wrote.   So let me try to get this straight: The headline stated that the  U.S.  didn't warn Vegas. But the article really says that Mayor Goodman and the casinos were warned (though they deny this) and didn't pass the info along for fear of a  financial  impact on the city?  Personally, I believe the FBI account. I live here, and the action (or inaction) of the mayor and the casinos just rings far too true for me. Yes, we have a lot of money going through this city. Mandalay Resort Group and MGM-Mirage have performed quite nicely for their shareholders. And the mayor is nothing more than a cheerleader in expensive suits. Why expect the truth - when the truth would darken their rosy picture?  In the next few days, if anything more is written about this, I hope Goodman & Co. prove me wrong. I, who have a life here, and a son, and people I love very much, want to be proven wrong.   UPDATE:  Here's something else: shame on AP for the misleading headline.

There are also  urlLink those who wanted to turn events to their own gain .  Without security, there can't be democracy. As long as al-Sadr and all those groups of hooded assholes with video cameras are allowed to run rampant, this mutation of martial law will have to continue -- along with all the airstrikes and car bombs and refugees and civilian casualties.  In order for Iraq to move forward, some people will have to be tossed out of the game.

       Because of the Western drought, Nevada will most likely be  urlLink designated a disaster area  for the second year in a row.  If you want to really want me to get torqued, then just get me thinking about water in Nevada.  "We're in the worst drought on record." That's the message on every billboard and ad placed by the Southern Nevada Water Authority. Turf all over Las Vegas is either being torn out or left to slowly die - and rightly so, considering the shortage. Lake Mead's level is dropping quickly, and we're begging for more water from the Colorado River (most of which is taken for Southern California).  And then you look to the Strip, where Steve Wynn's "Wynn Las Vegas" and Sheldon Adelson's humongous addition to the Venetian are only blocks away from each other, jockeying for skyline space. We've been told that the casino water features (fountains, canals, spitting cherubs) use reclaimed water. Fine. But explain this: thousands of rooms will be opening soon, and each one of those rooms will have toilets, sinks and showers. Each guest will require clean sheets (this is Vegas, after all), clean towels and clean dishes. Plus, every casino worth a damn needs a small ocean out back for all those sunbathers.  And then you look around the perimeter of this valley, where thousands of new homes, office buildings, and malls are replacing every square inch of available desert.  Considering we're in the worst drought on record, logic would mandate that development be slowed or restricted somehow. But our County Commission is rarely guided by logic. Instead, they're guided by zoning attorneys representing powerful developers and casino owners. An acquaintance of mine (a zoning attorney, and a rather good one) once summed it up nicely: "why be a politician when you can own one?"  This year, again, we're officially disasters. I only hope someday our officials will actually do something about it.

       I spent the last week on vacation, so now I'm trying to catch up with the world again. I must also work through the piles on my desk, so it'll take me a couple of days to get back into this page.  It was a short, happy, but strange trip. Highlights include 1) the look of joy on my son's face when 9,000 pounds of Shamu launched his body out of the water at Sea World, 2) seeing a submarine plow through San Diego Harbor on its way to sea, 3) climbing a ladder to the top of a 150-year-old lighthouse in Point Loma, 4) seeing my extended California family, 5) wandering around the Reagan Library and Museum in Simi Valley.  About that last thing. I'd never been to a presidential library before, so I expected a certain amount of bombast. What I got was completely unexpected - the place was so amazingly  honest . Iran Contra got coverage with "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." There was a full and affectionate acknowledgement of his movie career, and a wild variety of mementos of his journey through politics: like his cabinet room chair, a model of his Star Wars defense satellite, and the bulletproof vest and red "Mr. Rogers" cardigan he wore after the assassination attempt. Nancy got some good floor and exhibit space, and a lovely portion was devoted to their life at the Santa Barbara ranch.  Chilling and sad, though, were the letter he wrote announcing his Alzheimer's, and the many pieces central to the memorials: the catafalque where his coffin lay, the boots that were placed backwards in the stirrups, the bugle that played "Taps" over his coffin, and photos of the services everywhere.  And outside, in front of the curved wall where we said our last goodbyes, is a very simple stone with only this: Ronald Wilson Reagan 1911 - 2004. There's room on that stone for Nancy when she joins him.  I'm very glad I went.
