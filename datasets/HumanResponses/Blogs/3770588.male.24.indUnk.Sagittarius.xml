      During the run up to the war, I was told over and over again that Bush was attacking Iraq in order to get oil.  I drive an SUV, so I was pleased with this idea.  I spend a lot of money on gas and could use a drop in gas prices.  Well, with the transfer of sovereignty now official, it seems that the Bush Administration has lost its chance to suck all of the oil out of Iraq.  What kind of bumbling idiots are they?  They failed!!  For so long America had complete control over the area and yet gas prices rose for most of the occupation.  Recently prices have been going down, but I was dreaming of the days when gas was below a dollar.  I'm very disappointed.  Instead of taking the oil for free, the Coalition sold the oil on the market. You'd think we'd at least would have put the money from the sales to good use by giving America's rich another tax cut, but no.  All of the money from oil sales went into the Iraqi Redevelopment Fund.  What a crock.  We spent billions of dollars on the war and didn't get ANYTHING in return except for yet another free and democratic society.  Maybe we'll get it right with Iran.  Of course, with so many troops still in the country, maybe the army can stick a few barrels up it's collective shirt and sneak them out before they leave.  (In case you didn't catch it, the forgoing was something called sarcasm.)

      Hello Blog World!  I hope you find this blog at least mildly interesting.  If not, well, I can't help that.  I'd like to tip my hat to my friends  urlLink Nikhil Bhat  and  urlLink Kari Hammer  for being pioneers of the blog world in my circle of friends (half of a hat tip goes to  urlLink Eric Nies  who just rides on Nikhil's coattails).  Well, without further ado, the following is the first thing I want the world to know:  AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! That's what Michael Moore makes me do.  I know, it's probably what he wants.  He wants to infuriate those who happen to believe that the world is better off with Saddam Hussein out of power and Iraq on its way to democracy.  Well, he's succeeded in infuriating me, but not by what he says.  No, he does it with the way he says it.  I can handle opposing views.  In fact, I like opposing views.  I can understand that some people do not agree with President Bush's foreign policy (or any of his policies for that matter).  I like people who can articulately and reasonably espouse their views.  Only when people challenge my views can I learn and grow.  But that challenge must be based on facts, and when the facts are unclear we have to all agree that the facts are unclear.  Michael Moore doesn't play by these rules.  He believes that it is most effective to take bits and pieces of the facts and use them to spread his propaganda.  I'm not going to go into detail about his distortions because many other websites and blogs do it already, and I don't want to just cut and paste another's writing and research into my blog.  Here's a link to  urlLink New Megachip's post  on the topic.  Go there for some examples of the half-truths.  He says that it's not supposed to be political, yet he has said that he hopes the film helps John Kerry get elected president.  How can one get any more political than that??  I encourage no one to give money to this guy by going to see his movie.  In fact, I hope no one goes to it.  If you want to hear what he says, then do a Google search on it.  You'll get the points he wants to make and hopefully some balanced criticism of it.  I believe everyone has the right to speak his or her mind as protected by the First Amendment, and Michael Moore is speaking his mind.  I, in turn, am speaking mine to encourage you to not listen to his.  There are plenty of places to learn about the war and the Bush Administration.  Don't encourage people like Moore to only give half the story and pretend it's the gospel.  If you want to argue, argue with me.  I won't hide from bad facts and will admit when I'm wrong.

      In case you're wondering...I got absolutely no lovin' this summer.  But the title was either that or "A Mid-to-Latesummer's Night Dream."  Take your pick.  Well Kari posted to her site, so I figured I should too since it's been a long while.  I never did write the post on gay marriage.  I'm sorry to the readers who really wanted to read it, but the issue lost excitement for me.  The short post is that I can be on either side of it depending on when you ask.  I'm sorry, but I'm pulling a John Kerry here and waffling all over the place.  I can admit it on this issue.  If you want further exposition on my analysis of the pros and cons, post a comment and maybe I'll get fired up some night to do it.  Speaking of John Kerry, I watched my share of the Dem party convention.  Really, it was my share and the share of at least a quarter-million other Americans.  The only major speech I missed was the keynote given by Barak Obama (sp?), who is being called an up-and-coming Dem star.  After watching Edward's speech, I'm willing say that some day he'll win the Democratic nomination for president.  And when he does, he'll be hard to beat.  He's got a lot of the Clinton charm.  Republicans will have to keep an eye on him.  Kerry, on the other hand, has no charm whatsoever.  He made no real policy statements in his acceptance speech and is trying to get to the right of Bush on the war on terrorism.  As was well articulated on the Daily Show, he's the best choice for the Anybody-but-Bush crowd because he stands for nothing.  The best, and only, thing he has going for him is that he really isn't President Bush.  At least Dean stood for something.  For those who are my keeper, I'll be moving down to Vermillion tomorrow to restart my life as a student one last time.  Oddly, I've already had my annual not-prepared-for-a-test/extremely-late-to-class dream.  It usually happens right before classes begin, but it has been occurring earlier the last few years.  Does that mean something?  Anyway, on my way down I'll be stopping by Sioux Valley in SF where my grandmother is.  She's not in her best condition, so please keep her in your prayers.  See many of you soon!

      It is finished.  I have ordered a Dell 9100.  I'm getting an Intel Pentium 4 processor (3.0 GHz) and a WSXGA+ screen, which is the mid-range screen.  60 GB of hard drive space, 512MB of RAM, and a 64MB graphics card.  It's probably heavier than I want it to be, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I'm also worried about the battery life.  If I don't like it, I can return it within 21 days and get a full refund.  I went with this one over the 8600 because the 9100 was $300 cheaper PLUS is has 20 extra gigs of HD space and a better graphics card.  The only benefits of the 8600 are that it's about 2lbs. lighter and has a much longer battery life.  Is that worth the $300, etc.? I don't know. The only catch is that it came with a free printer, but it did NOT come with a cord to connect the printer to the computer.  That was $23.  I had the option not to get the cord, but whatever.  Sooo....here's the big question.  What do I do with my old computer and printer?  Do they, like all dogs, go to heaven? Do I need to bury it or cremate it?  I don't know the proper protocol.  Are there stores that buy used computers and printers?  Should I put it up on eBay?  Anybody got an idea?  Final services won't take place until I receive the new computer and decide to keep it, so I have some time, which I'll use to mourn.

      A big thank you to everyone that provided advice on what computer to get.&nbsp; A big [expletive] you to all the grammar freaks who just can't handle human imperfection.&nbsp; It's not my fault I never learned to read.&nbsp; (Kari, I do notice and&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;your restraint.)  &nbsp;  Nikhil had a good point with Gateway's lack of presence in SD.&nbsp; Really, that's about the only reason I was considering them.&nbsp; I do like to support the local businesses, but there comes a point when the cost-benefit analysis adds up against them.&nbsp; Per Kennon's recommendation, I'll probably stop by Best Buy in a couple weeks to check out their selection, but I want to have more power over customization than allowed at a brick-and-mortar store.  &nbsp;  I'm leaning towards the  urlLink Dell 9100 .&nbsp; It's about as high-end as Dell gets with the laptop, which hopefully means it will last a few years and will make a good desktop substitute.&nbsp; I'm shooting for around four years lifespan.&nbsp; That'll get me through the last year of law school, a year-long clerkship, and a couple years into practice.&nbsp; We'll see though.&nbsp; The battery life isn't good, but maybe I can give on that point.&nbsp; Does anybody know if there is a store that carries Dell computers?&nbsp; I'd like to get a general feel for the size and shape of it before I buy.&nbsp; I'll probably toss Kari's around a little bit (thanks Kari!) to get a general idea of the Dells, but the 9100 is a bit bigger and heavier than hers.  &nbsp;  Anyway, for those who can't wait, the gay marriage post should be coming out (no pun intended) around Wednesday night.

      Since more than one of my readers has inquired into my position on gay marriage, I'll post my thought on that in the near future. I want to carefully prepare my thoughts on it though, so until then I'll keep your attention with this survey.   Although my Gateway 2300 has severed me well over the past six years, I have come to the realization that it is time for a new one. Although I had hoped to use it for my entire time at USD, I found out that my laptop has no ability to access a wireless network and the law school is now wireless. All wireless technology requires a minimum of Windows 98 Second Edition, and I only have the first edition. Although I theoretically could get the update, I'm not sure if my laptop can handle it. In addition, I don't want to spend money on upgrading to 98SE just to make my computer last one more year. The better investment is in a whole new computer.  So, what computer should I get?  It has to be a portable. The dimensions aren't important, although I don't want it too big. HD capacity isn't important, although I would like a fast processor and better than average RAM. DVD &amp; CD-RW drives. And I want a long battery life. Finally, it has to be a PC. Macs are the devil, and those who use them have given in to it's promise of quick and easy power.   Any thoughts out there?  What are the best laptops on the market?

      The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow (Wednesday) on the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment .  (For the parliamentarians out there, they're really voting on a Cloture Motion, which basically ends debate and allows the Senate to vote on the actual proposal.)  Republicans have nowhere near the 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture, let alone the 2/3 (67 votes) necessary to approve the measure.  Yet knowing they're going to lose, they hold the vote anyway.  Why?  Because it's an election year and some conservatives get really pumped over this issue.  Liberals oppose it, but it's not as important to them, so in the end by fighting for it the Republicans can only win. Of course, proponents of the FMA say they're brining it up because liberal judges in Massachusetts are forcing the issue.  Now, that's also correct.  Republicans wouldn't be talking about this if the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts hadn't required the State of Mass. to allow homosexuals to marry.  Here's what the 28th Amendment would say if the FMA ever made it through the entire amendment process:  Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman. Personally, I don't support this amendment.  That's right, I said "don't." It sets one national policy on marriage, which is an issue that should be left to the states.  That, and it's just badly written.  When constitutional scholars have to argue about what the second sentence means before it's approved ( urlLink and they are ), it's only going to mean the US Sup. Ct. will have a lot of trouble in the future with it.  Although they are considering deleting the second sentence, it still wouldn't fix my first objection.  I would support an amendment that reads something to the effect of the following: "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to require the Congress or any State to recognize marriage as anything more than the union between a man and a woman."  This places the issue squarely and solely in the hands of each state (and the Congress for DC and federal territories).  If Mass. wants gay marriage and Vermont want civil unions and South Dakota wants to maintain marriage in its traditional form, then they can each can have what they want and won't have to recognize marriages from other states.  Now do I support or oppose gay marriage in South Dakota? That's for another post.

      As anyone who follows politics (or really anyone who occasionally watches or reads the news) knows, John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate.  I think this reveals an interesting flaw in John Kerry's character.  Instead of choosing Dick Gephardt, who would have made a better Vice President, he chose Edwards, who looks better on TV and has more energy.  Why would Gephardt have made a better VP you ask?  He has YEARS of experience in government.  This man has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1976.  Edwards has not even served a full term in the Senate.  Gephardt knows the issues and can make reasonable, coherent arguments in favor of his positions.  Edwards used generalities and the "Two Americas" theme to gloss over important issues during the primary.  Gephardt can help deliver Missouri, which is swing state that voted for Bush in 2000, and he is very close with the labor unions, which can help in persuading America's workers that Kerry would be better for the economy.  North Carolina (Edwards' home state) is safely in the Bush column and the only group Edwards is close with is the trial lawyers, who are liked by Americans about as much as tax collectors.  Why is this important?  Because Kerry is hoping that Edwards will bring "excitement" to his campaign to make up for Kerry's lack of charisma.  On the day of the announcement, EVERY Democrat that got near a microphone used the word "excitement" in explaining the decision.  They didn't say ANYTHING about his actual ability to be VP, or more importantly, the President.  Energy is important and I do like candidates and politicians that can make me feel good about my government, but when it comes to making real decisions, I'd rather have someone who makes the right decision than someone who excites me about the wrong decision.  Kerry chose to make someone next in line for the presidency who is not qualified for the position.  It shows that he'll do anything to win despite the consequences.

      Well, I just got back from the lake where I shot off my annual portion of fireworks with the family.  There were a lot of people around the lake shooting off the fireworks.  And there's more people with the BIG stuff, as in you need a license for it.  The Fourth of July is my second favorite holiday (right behind Christmas, and it's second only because my whole family gets together for Christmas, oh and that birth of my Savior thing too).  The Fourth is so great because of the combination of my family getting together at the lake for some good summer food and fun, the patriotic-ness of it, and of course the pyrotechnics.  God Bless America!

      Just so that you don't think that I'm a Bush  urlLink sycophant , here's a post in support of the Supreme Court's ruling in  urlLink Rasul v. Bush  giving detainees the right to have a hearing. (I know, this topic is a few days old and blogs are supposed to be right on top of things, but I was busy getting ready for the trial today in which I convicted a guy of DUI.)  I've never been happy with the policy that people can be held indefinely without the opportunity for a hearing.  It just runs completely contrary to the American system of justice.  Everyone deserves due process and the heart of due process is the right to a hearing.  Now I understand that in war we can't be giving immediate hearings to every person captured.  They're not going to get the same rights as a regular criminal in the US (as in a bond hearing within 24 hours of being arrested).  I can't believe though that it would be hard for the Department of Defense to set up a military tribunal for this purpose.  Give them all military lawyers, and have a least some basic hearing to justify prolonged detention.  I believe that Congress should act and define exactly what the hearings should look like, but I don't think the Republicans want to do anything contrary to the White House in this election year for fear of looking disunified.  That's the nature of politics.  At least the USSC was able to see that Gitmo is for all practical purposes a part of the US.  Yea for  urlLink habeas corpus !

      Before I begin, I'd like to thank Kennon for his gentle reminder that I haven't updated my blog in a while. I appreciate his devotion.  Well I'm back in Vermillion now. I have been for almost two weeks. I've been mainly participating in the U. Housing hall director training. No, I'm not a hall director, but I work with them. I also had to train the HDs in all things judicial, since that's my job.  I've been studying for the MPRE (Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam), which is the ethics portion of the bar exam. I have to pass it before I can sit for the main portion of the bar exam next summer. I'll be taking the MPRE tomorrow.  In other news, USD is now a Pepsi campus. That's right, Coke has lost this particular battle in the cola wars. I would have setup a defense with gun turrets in the old armory in the middle of campus, but it's still under construction. Of course, the forces of Pepsi easily overran the campus because they gave USD some sort of grant.  At least that's what I've heard. There is not a Coke machine to be found anywhere on campus now. And worst of all, a bottle of Pepsi (or Mountain Dew) costs $1.25 at the law school. $1.25!! How did the price of a bottle of pop increase from $1 to $1.25 in the course of a day?!? (And that's a rhetorical question for the economists out there.) It's just outrageous. I'm outraged. It's outraging. I refuse to pay $1.25 for a bottle of Mt. Dew, let alone a bottle of Pepsi. I've even heard rumors that the Bump won't be able to sell Coke products. More on that when the facts are confirmed. Damn monopolies!    Ok, I'm off for more studying!
