              There's something you my give      A friend and stranger too      it seems that when you give it      It's given back to you      This gift is worth a million      But doesn't cost a dime;      It's lasting in effect      But doesn't take much time      This simple little gesture      Can make the dayworthwhile      It's just as good as sunshine      It's what we call a smile.

      i really can't believe it with my two eyes! imagine i bought a new pants for a price of less than 80% from the original price(giordano) and shirt (???) wow...wow...  i saved more. it gives me euphoria.  that's for now.

      changes maybe good or bad. we have to avoid the bad effects that adversely affects our life, property and environment. modernization through science has both good and bad effects. but if the bad effects supersede the good effects, then these modern changes must stop. we must do our share in maintaining a healthy environment.  i love mother nature.

      this is my first time to create my new website thru blogspot. take time to tour in my humble creation. it's really exciting to have one. i'm beginning to start a new realization that nothing is permanent in this world. everything... as in anything... at least give me one. confussions...commotion...communication...anything goes. actually,i don't know how to start this. it makes me kinda sucks... beginning to have headaches... but it's new to me. i don't know why i'm doing this. maybe, for self-satisfaction. right!!??!!!

      	whenever i go around, i used to memorize the landmarks of each place. i have good sense of direction...would you believe, my mom let me memorize the philippine map... and even the streets we're going to pass way to our home. imagine, at my age of 3 years old, i opted to sit beside the window of the car just to take glance of the road.   and it's great help because everybody is proud of me. one more thing, i'm always mesmerized of the different flags of the world. everytime before i go to bed, i always take a look on flags. i just don't know why...maybe, i want to travel and learn different cultures.
