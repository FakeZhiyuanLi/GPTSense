      T.C.-Cofounder Matt-Cofounder Paul-Samdow  What we like to do is get together, drink, play video games, play drinking games, listen to music and watch movies and sporting events.  What else is there really to do?  Oh yeah, drinking is always good.

      what a great weekend.  some have called it the greatest weekend/bday party of all time.  there was drinking, and stealing and all sorts of fun.  matt stole a couch from an elevator.  he was drunk and after finding the couch decided that he should take it.  then he decided while he was stealing stuff he should take a "wet floor" sign from the janitors closet.

      TC Shillingford, SMAT cofounder, good friend, jackass.  the last ones not really true, well, yes it is, but not always.  most of the time.  ok, its definately true.  the man who made the money to fund a summer of drunkeness.  thats got to say something for his character.  as he described it to me: "Paul has a fake id to buy booze with, Matt likes to drink, and I have money, so we combined and got drunk."  what a guy.  i dont know anyone else with such generosity.  "Its hard to sleep with pants on, so im not going to do it."

      Well start with one of the cofounders of SMAT:  The one, the only Matt Cassidy.  what can you say about Matt Cassidy that hasnt already been said?  well, to be honest theres not much out there.  im pretty sure he has been called everything i can think of and you know what his response has been.(if you dont, refer to #9 of the shirt) but seriously, he is a great guy.  who else can be so unpopular at home, and a god at school.  when were out in wayne people flock to him, like hes a celebrity.  his arnold levels are up around conan.  and thats pretty frickin arnold.  i mean the only way to become more arnold is to be arnold himself, oh and hes on his way.  who else has ever gotten six dows in one day?  thats got to be a record.

      In true SMAT fashion im really lazy.  i havent bothered to put anything up recently.  or at least not recent enough for some SMAT members cough cough paul cough cough.  so i am here to deliver this message.  SMAT is still awesome.  Seriously.  and i, still wish i was as awesome as them.  if anyone wants to do something awesome, buy the family guy seasons on dvd.  then give them to SMAT or me.  that would be so deck.

      Friday night was awesome.  Within 15 minutes of the SMAT reunion, a bottle of Baileys and a bottle of Wild Turkey had been killed.  I Stephen Shillingford (SMAT wannabe) booted and passed out on the floor.  Matt and TC stayed up all night and met a homless man named James.  I dont really know what happened to Paul, besides being drunk.  Ive just gotta ask, did I really boot as much as I was told iI did?  If so, Im a champ.  Several drunk dials were made, but I dont believe anyone connected with the other person.  What a shame.  It was still an awesome night, dont you wish you were there?  Unless you were, and then, dont you wish you could keep on doing it over and over again?

      there was a man who said i enjoy to drink.  there was another man who said i have a fake id that says i am 22.  another man said i have a job and have a few hundred bucks to spend, but i dont know what to do with it.  alone, they had no true talents.  but with there powers combined they formed SMAT, the greatest group ever formed.  they fight evil, they drink, they stay up all night and talk to homeless people, they play some mean red faction 2, and all love  ARNOLD .  this past summer they came together to form this awesome alliance.  but soon were separated by school returning.  so what do they do? whenever possible they reunite and continue to thwart, evil, play games and talk all while completely housed.  and now, they are forming again, this weekend to carry on doing what they do best.  i hope you liked the story.  SMAT forever.. .or until something better comes comes along.

      thats just a reminder to all of you who are having your own side conversations in the guestbook (josh and nan).  and have either of you ever met SMAT?  clearly the most racist people above north carolina.  the guestbook is for showering SMAT with praises or for SMAT to challenge people to fights.  were still waiting to see if swat will accept the challenge.  its not for defending your own stupidity because youve got a name like josh because you cant read the part of the guestbook that says "name".

      the jungle will have to be as cassidy suggested behind the middle school at 6.  this will be over the summer.  as all of SMAT will most likely be retarded and as quoted "wont be able to see who shows up anyway" it should be interesting.  this fight is gonna be awesome.  if you want to come tickets will be 10 bucks (so you can just forget about the money i apparently owe you).  i cant wait for it.  p.s. - to whoever contiues to sign the book without putting a name, thats really midtown of you.  so from now on you will be josh.

      the count has now been changed.  3 awesomes and no lames.  im so proud.  though, you could argue that most of our "readers" are lame.  i put "readers" in quotes because i doubt that most of you have actually been reading the site.  i mean, someone thinks paul is writing this(its not him).  its clearly stated in the 4th posting that i am a SMAT wannabe.  so this is not being written by a SMAT member.  but there has been something thats been bothering me.  and that is the issue of SWAT.  Single Women Alone Together.  they suck.  there would be no need for SMAT if some of these SWAT people hadnt gone and made SMAT single.  so SWAT should really just shut the hell up, before someone actually points this out to them.

      every time someone signs the guestbook its about getting their money.  so i was wrong, so here is a note.   IF YOU WANT YOUR MONEY COME TO MY HOUSE AND GET IT.  DONT JUST SAY "PAY ME" . cause lets face it, i dont know you, so how can i find you? but in the end you would probably have to pay ten dollars to find/get to me, so why bother?  thats what i thought.  im glad we agree, but i would really appreciate what you think of the site.  also, im ready to attempt the gallon challenge again.  tell me if you want to come and watch or join in the attempt.  that way we can work out a time. (if you dont like to see the boot master at work, i suggest not coming, cause when i boot, its epic.)  i now count 2 awesomes and 1 lame.

      your damn right it wasnt.  this time it was filled with more stupidity.  not even drunken stupidity, were talking pure sober stupidity.  well go through the weekend, highlighting the stupid parts.  FRIDAY:  Lets play some beer pong.  ok.  oh wait, we dont have any balls.  damn.  well have to get some tomorrow.  SATURDAY:  Lets go get some balls.  ok.  so now we have the balls.  oh here lets donate to a charity.  and get paul some weird glasses, that he refused to take off.  for the rest of the weekend.  ok, so lets go to best buy. and buy 100 bucks worth of dvds.  ok then we go to play pong. finally. oh wait we left them in a locked car.  i guess well play caps.  pong style.  great decision there.  then lets go to minellas, where paul got some guy angry for walking around minellas without waiting to be seated.  (the last one we were pretty drunk, but still)  SUNDAY:  nothing really stupid happened. but i attribute that to cass leaving the shillinfords household.    what a great weekend.

      finally, someone signed the guestbook in a correct manner.  Megster, came to the site, and just said that she loved all 3 SMAT members.  everyone else (but the SMAT members) have been doing it wrong.  all they say is wheres my money.  if i see her, i may just have to pay up.

      i havent promoted any sites on here, cause i didnt really care.  but with no SMAT activity recently ive got to update.  so here are some of the most  ARNOLD  sites out there. www.homestarrunner.com www.ainitcoolnews.com www.hipsterhandbook.com www.emotioneric.com www.fatmouse.tk  these should keep you amused for hours on end.  and if it doesnt, then your unbelievably keanu.  way to go jackass.  your bringing everyone else down.

      how do you like that?  thats a little trick thingy.  hahaha.  but seriously, if youve continues to read this you are undenialbly under our control.  so please send money to one of the SMAT members.  lots of it.  funding is needed.  we thank you for any possible donations.  oh, and if you say that your a college student and cant afford it, then thats a blatent lie, you should always be able to afford giving money to SMAT.

      what is that?  i saw the card, and thats just lame.  any club that needs cards is fin.  SMAT clearly superior than any other club i have ever heard of.  mostly because its  not really a club.  its a small social group.  theres only 3 members, one undercover, and a pledge.  besides, mall club, your name is pretty weak.  couldnt you have jsut been a little more creative.  do all official meetings have to occur at a mall?  if not, do they have to be done in places where you are able to shop?  and why do you have to be official?  is there an unofficial mall club as well?  do they have the cards as well?    please answer and i will continue to make fun of you.

      sorry about the lack of updates, but there was no internet for a week.  so back off.  i know you have all been dying to read about the SMATacular things that have been going on.  so just in case you dont know- TC is in scotland, ptizzle and cass are workin hard, or maybe hardly workin?  one things for sure on any given night a SMAT member is drunk, because youve got to keep stereotypes going on.  thats important.  you all might want to write that down somewhere.  And now to help you to change yourselves to be more like SMAT a helpful list.  How to be Metal As Fuck: -Claim that The Beatles "suck shit" to be provacative. -Nod approvingly when a buddy throws a recyclable can in with the regular garbage.  -Denounce vegetarianism as being pussy.  -Engage in hippie/Phish/jamband bashing.  -Discuss the art of Judas Priest while watching Heavy Metal Parking Lot. -Enter into a discussion about guitar pedals. -Make a witty remark about having sex with one's mom, grandmother, or sister.  -Use the word fucking as often as possible in phrases such as "Thursday Fucking Night."

      A conversation between PTown and myself about what he has been doing as of late.  stephen: tell me everything you want the people to know about what you have been doing paul: i got drunk paul: claimed to be invincible paul: and chugged bong water stephen: gross paul: true paul: but i was a stud and kept it down stephen: fantastic paul: i also pissed on a cop car stephen: is this in texas paul: while he was next to it paul: yea stephen: nice move paul: lecturing a friend of mine about drinking stephen: did he see you paul: nope stephen: so deck paul: massively paul: and all my friends down there had read the hipster handbook paul: it was quality stephen: yes paul: did half a bottle of turkey stephen: you are truly a god paul: ha i wouldnt go that far paul: just an idiot stephen: fine  Our conversation drifted from what he had been doing to songs and then to how he was waiting for TC to come visit and look for a cheesesteak vendor.  But when I said by I was left with these words of wisdom:  Auto response from hazymist01: nothing describes love like a good monster ballad

      one says that if smat touches the other that member will be killed, the other seems a little hopeful at the prospect of datin one of the smat brothers.  so heres my solution.  to decide who gets lil' brandli we should hold our own version of: The Dating Game.  it would be such a good idea, cause we would disguise the voices of the boys and let kate and lauren choose together.  that way one gets a date the other feels a little better or worse (depending on who they pick) about the situation.  i am so good about these things.

       Paul :  he came. he saw. he conquered.  he emailed Justin Hawkins, the lead singer from the band The Darkness(if you dont know who they are download the song I Believe In A Thing Called Love).  Paul being the crafty person he is has actually convinced the band to come and play at Penn.  They will be playing at Irvine Auditorium, starting around 8:30.  This may be the most freakin arnold thing i have ever heard of.  I still cant believe that he convinced them to play.  I suggest you make your way down to Penn and see them, they are a great band.   Matt :  from what hes told me, though the details arent entirely clear, the night after he gets back from school he has a date.  who could the lucky lady be?  none other then lauren brandli, kates little sister.  i know that kate will be thrilled that she has choosen such a fine mate.  good luck to both of them and may they be happy for many years.   TC :  we all know that he is a huge hypocrite.  he says things like dont smoke while lighting up a cigarrette, dont drink while hes gettin drunk.  he says he hates emo, but now we know for sure that that is a lie.  TC has started a band called Lostt Forever.  they are having a recording session with columbia records in hopes of obtaining a record deal.  this is possible cause our aunt has huge connections in the music business, so she set him up with someone at  columbia records.  i wonder if theyll tour with The Darkness?

      Lets way the pros and cons of expanding.    Pro:  Going on a national level would be deck as shit.  Con:  By expanding, you lose that tightly knit group of friends.  Pro:  The more members, the more of a legacy it can leave behind.  Con:  New Jersey, still sucks except for the shore.  Pro:  New chapters could pay to join, that would be pretty freakin sweet.  Con:  If they were to be true SMAT members they would end up saying "Fuck that, I aint payin for shit."  Pro:  If they were to be true SMAT members they would end up saying "Fuck that, I aint payin for shit."  Con:  In all expansions I have seen in my lifetime, the expansions, seem to suck alot for quite sometime, maybe showing some promise, but failing more often then not.  I just dont think that SMAT is right for expansion, mostly because, lets face it, SMAT is TC, Paul and Matt.  There should never be anything else that comes to mind, especially New Jersey.  I've poked alot of fun at NJ tonight.  And lets face it, they deserve it.  New Jersey Sucks.

      Wow.  It was without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen.  TC, Paul, Charlie, Janice and myself saw the 1201 showing on opening night.  It was outstanding.  The deckness of the movie was more then enough to compensate for a lack of sleep.  Everyone was great, Legolas gave another great line, that if he had not said, no one in the theater would have known what was going on.  Oh and there was a preview that makes me realize how badly hollywood is in need for quality films.  The Mask 2, starring a baby.  A BABY!  WTF MATES?!?

      And so...  SMAT is batting poorly presently, and with no prospects for improvement.  There's a reason for this, but I'm not sure exactly what it is.    Do you have reasonably cool, attractive, single, female friends?  Do they live in the Philadelphia area?  How about you send 'em on over to the SMATpartment, and we can tango...

      hey brandli how about watching what you say.  no one-especially charlie- will ever tell SMAT what to do.  and at least 2 of the SMAT members and i know the password and all to the site.  its just that lazyness takes over around this time of the year.  i think you should remember this next time you go running your mouth on the message board.  "who makes the best sandwich at wawa?"   honestly, you didnt even specify what kind of sandwich!  and does speed count?!?!  these things are important when having such a debate.  god.

      June 20, 2004 marks the one year anniversary of the existence of SMAT.  In honor of this, the SMAT site is getting some changes--new layout, a dedication to actually posting, and all that fun stuff.    Unfortunately, because I was excited to do this, I accidentily erased the link to the SMAT guestbook, and thus, there can be no more signatures on its hallowed pages.  This might be for the best since things were starting to get dicey in there.   Any suggestions for posting material are welcomed and, in fact, encouraged, but for now there are plans for SMAT bios, a SMAT-glossary, lists of all things Arnold and Keather. I see how I have grown from being jealous of the people with good dads to finally accepting my childhood with my dad. As I am get older and more settled with my wonderful husband, I understand more how h

      Who? If you know us, chances are you are welcome to come. What? SMAT Week 3.0 Where? Paul's house. When? July 10-17 Why? Because we want to. How? His family is gone.  I think that covers everything.

      A mixture of boredom and desire to express my point of view has led me to make my own Rules for a Mix Tape/CD (as in High Fidelity).  So here we go:  1- You have a maximum of two songs per  artist.  No more.   2- Try to keep the same sort of genre.  And by genre I mean don't give me metal and emo.  But on the whole, just don't give me emo.  3- If you do end up repeating artists there must be at least two tracks in between the songs.  4- Never label your mixes.  And if possible always use the same kind of CD (I am a fan of Staples Cd-R, 80 minutes long).  5- Always, and I mean always have a random song in there for no more reason than you simply like the song.  It should not come that close to your CD's genre and should be as catchy as possible.  Also, put this song at the end.  6- Fill up as much as your CD as possible.  Leave as little time as you can without breaking the other rules.  7- If you have the ability to use the Crossfade option, do so.  It is like Starwipe for video transitions.  8- Do not under any circumstances use the 5 second gap in between songs.  Chances are, the song ends and there is already a few seconds of silence added to it, so don't add your own damn silence.  9- Make at least one CD that features only stupid, catchy songs (Enormous Penis by Da Vinci's Notebook) and have someone who will sing songs outloud listen to it.  Then go to Wawa (or any other store).  10- Have at least one song that you don't really know why you put it on the CD and skip it everytime you come to it.  People will become confused and want to know what the mysterious song is, but whatever happens do not tell them.  Those are my secrets, now go out and use them!

      More and more each day I hate my job. It's not really a job or work anymore. It is just really a place I go to for about 20 or so hours a week and get paid for being there. While other people scurry around doing what they are supposed to be doing there is a good chance, almost a certainty that I will be more of an inconveniance then helpful. It would not be so bad, and I am sure that I would be a much better employee if it were not for all the stupid people who come through the doors of my humble shop.  This is a list of the stupid things that have been said to me and my co-workers while at work and how they were handled. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed telling it(Customers are in bold, third parties are in italic).  Customer and myself. - Excuse me, do you sell sandwiches?  -No. - Where can I get one?   -What do you want? - Anything.  -Wawa. - Not that.   -Chilli's. - No, what about fish, do you sell fish?  -Are you kidding?  Customer on the phone and me. -Hello, CVS. - How can I buy a Gateway computer?  -Call Gateway. Hang up phone.  Customer to me. - Do you sell vitamins?   Customer to me while I am in the Hallmark aisle. - Do you sell birthday cards?   Customer and one of my mangers. - Do you sell dishwasher soap?  -Yes(Proceeds to walk away).  Customer to me. - Do you work here?  -No, I just like the shirt.  Customer to me. - You told me that it was in 5, but it was in 6.  -I have no idea what you are talking about. - I had just asked you where the dish soap was.  -I doubt that.  Customer to me and my manager. - Can you return this for me?  -I have to get my manager. - Ok.  - What's up?  -She has a return. - I know that you need to do it, but can he do it?  - No, but I will help you over in the photolab.  - Is that where you are doing the return? Can he come down and do it?  -(Simultaneously) NO.  That is all I can think of for now, feel free to share any of your experiances.

      I have come to a logical decision that I have a sleeping disorder. It started over a year ago at the end of sophmore year. For the last 14 months or so I have had trouble falling asleep and then staying asleep. And when I actually do sleep it is not what one would call quality sleep. As the problem progressed it was decided that I should see a doctor. My doctor suggested that I go to a sleep study. At that study it was decided that there was nothing wrong with me and and I decided that doctors don't know what they are talking about. So my sleep problems have continued and for a while I just accepted them. Recently my sleep has gotten worse. In the past week I have not fallen asleep earlier than 3, and that is not something I enjoy.  My real problem is, I have no idea what is wrong with me. It is not insomnia, as I know when I am sleeping, though it feels really short all the time. And it is not sleep apnea, as I have not woken up with a shortness of breath.  It scares me alot, as when you lay in bed for long periods of time you begin to think alot of "what if" kind of scenarios. These tend to terrify me. I hate the night more then anytime of the day.  No one else is up as late as I am, or at least no one I talk to.  I wouldn't mind it so much if I could sleep like I do when I take a nap, just unknowingly fall asleep and then wake up hours later refreshed.  But going to bed means climbing the steps, and getting into bed.  It never really bothers me until I have been in bed for about 10 minutes.  That is when the "What if I was not around anymore?" or "How would people react to my death?"  I tend to answer these questions with "Not many people would care."  Now I know that there are some who would be greatly upset (my family) and a few friends, but I feel that I am not close enough to many people for it to matter.  Under 20 people at my school would notice if I was not there anymore.  There just are not many people from school who I get along with and that I talk to that much.  I would much rather spend my time with SMAT and pretty much everyone else I have hung out with repeatedly this summer.  I feel that the people of Radnor High School have nothing left to offer me and I have nothing left for them...  It is not going to be a good night.

      I was at IMDB.com tonight, and have decided that only idiots post on this site. I was looking through one of the message boards and it was pretty much alot of people being very stupid. It was an M. Night Shyamalan board and from what I could tell it was everyone having nothing but bad things to say about him and his movies. I don't mind if you state you opinion, I am all about that. What I have a problem with is how many of these people said things like "I have been saying it for 5 years, he is a terrible filmmaker". If you hated someones work so much the first time, but hoped it would be better I could see you going to the second film. If you hated that one even more, why go back again? And if you hate that film just as much why are you going back for another go at it? Quit you bitching and stop seeing his movies if you hate it so much. Odds are most of the people who go to his section don't want to hear about how much a movie sucked according to someone who never like the guy in the first place.  Then I came across a thread saying that all of the M. Night haters should go to a thread that they would like. This made me rethink my original hypothesis that "all posters on IMDB are complete idiots". So my second hypothesis went along the lines of "The majority of posters on IMDB are idiots". As I continued to read through the thread, one poster, the one that had started the "go to a thread where you will be happy" made a statement that angered me enough to come up with a third hypothesis which we will get to shortly. The statement was "I bet your defintion of a good movie is Star Wars or Star Trek". Bullshit. I can see how Star Wars can get thrown in there what with the recent suck George Lucas has been able to produce. But Star Trek? Those films are all OSCAR worthy. William Shatner is untouchable as Capt/Admiral James T. Kirk. He gives stunning performances. Which brings me to my third hypothesis "People in general are stupid and what seems to have happened is that they are all at IMDB.com".
