      Hello everyone.  I have been out of pocket a little here lately and thus the absence of new post.  Work has kept me busy plus Whitney has not been feeling well so I have been trying to be a good husband and help her out as much as possible.  I've been trying to think of things to write about.  I have plenty of ideas, mostly about the tactics being used overseas.  I think that we are being much too soft with these people and that they would probably be a little more reluctant to kidnap our people if we unleashed our full arsenal on them every time they did.  I know, I know, "That's not the American way" (in a whiny Democrat voice) but perhaps if it were our guys wouldn't be getting their heads cut off every other day.  That's all I'll say for fear that if I put my real feelings on what we should do, they would no longer let me publish my blog.  Just a music note, if you like Bluegrass, you really should get Alison Krause and Union Station Live.  It's great!

      Yesterday I had my first official Father's Day as a stepdad.  I say first official because Whitney and I were dating last year and Cade got me something then for the special occasion but I must say that this year was extra special since I am now officially "Daddy" according to Cade.  We went over to Whitney's parents last night and Cade and I got out in the yard and played baseball for the first time, just me and him.  I think that's every sports dad's ultimate thrill.  Cade is only 2 and a half but he can already hit the ball pretty hard when he is able to get a hold of a good pitch.  It brought back memories of my childhood.  My dad was a truck driver and because of that he was gone more often than he was home in order to provide for his family.  But every weekend, if I didn't have a game, dad was out there in the yard with my catcher's mitt, bad knees and all, letting me hurl fastballs and curves that went everywhere.  Back then, I thought he did it because he wanted me to be a better pitcher but now I realize that he did it just to spend time with me.  That was the only time that it was just me and him doing something together that we both really enjoyed.  He was always doing special stuff for me too, sometimes I think to make up for all the time he missed with me and Jeff.  I remember one game that our coach brought a Louisville Slugger that was made out of airplane aluminun.  It was the bat to beat all bats and my dad told me that if I could hit with it, he'd buy me one.  Sure enough, my first at bat, I basically hit a home run to dead center but the centerfielder reached over the fence and stole my glory.  But that's all it took for dad.  I heard him tell my mother as I was returning to the dugout, "Well, I guess I owe him a new bat!"  The next day we looked all over town for one and finally found it.  But when we took it to the counter, it rang up for $135.  Being a man of his word, dad simply wrote out the check and told me I had better bat .500 or better since my bat must have been laced with gold or something.    I can't wait to pass on the things that my dad taught me to Cade, like how to throw a curveball or get a football to have a perfect spiral.  And one day, just like my dad, I'll be sitting in the stands or out on the field coaching or umpiring, just because I love my son enough to be active in what he is interested in.  We need more dad's like that.  I'm glad my dad cared enough to do all of those things.  I love you, dad!

      Do you know what I am sick and tired of?  Jokes on these talk shows (Jay Leno, in particular) that have something President Bush has said or done as the punchline.  In my opinion, being that he is the leader of the free world, he deserves a little more respect than that.  Now I realize that President Bush isn't exactly a rocket scientist, but at least he is himself and comfortable when doing an interview.    Don't just think that I am ranting about this because I am as Republican as it gets (except for the whole wealthy thing that ALL Republicans are assumed to be).  I would feel the same way about John Kerry should he be elected (heaven forbid!!).    I guess what irks me most is that all of these people who sit there and poke fun haven't ever tried being president.  They don't know what kind of stress and pressure the man is under.  They don't do much to contribute to this country but they can sure poke fun at the man running it.  All I am saying is that as leader of the free world, a man who has stood up to terrorists and not backed down, and President of the United States of America, he deserves respect from the people that he is serving.  So what if he can't correctly pronounce a city or two in Iraq or Iran.  I can't either!!  Can you??  I know their freedom of the press (no offense Daniel) will allow this to continue and that is what makes America so different and so much better than the rest of the world, but it is so disrespectful that it makes my skin crawl.

      Tim McGraw has a new song out that literally kept me awake last night thinking of it's content.  The song is basically a conversation between two men in their early 40's and one has been diagnosed with a terminal disease.  The friend asked the sick man what he did when he got the news and here is his response:           I went skydiving, I went Rocky Mountain climbing, I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu.  And I loved deeper, and I spoke sweeter, and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying.  And he said someday I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying.   What would I do if I got the news that I had a short time to live?  I remember being in the room with Pa when the doctor came in and told him that there was nothing left to do and that he was going to die.  He simply responded that we all gotta go sometime.  Here's what I'd do, in no particular order.   1.  I'm sure that I would start being a better Christian man.  I'm ashamed that it would take something like that for me to finally live like I should have been for 25 years.  I'd read my Bible every day, and just spend as much time as I could talking to God, and ask him to calm my nerves, I'm sure.  2.  I'd mend broken relationships.  People I haven't talked to in years that at one time I considered my friend, people I have wronged and at the time didn't really care.    3.  I'd tell my wife how much I love her every time I saw her.  Not just once or twice a day like I do now, but every time that I crossed her path.  I'd hug and squeeze my children until they begged me to let them go.  4.  I'd move closer to home to be with my family as much as possible.  I'd call my mom or go see her every day.   5.  I'd do something crazy, like ride a bull or I'd love to take a couple of laps around Daytona or Talledega in a NASCAR stock car.  Listen to the song if you get a chance.  Hopefully, it will make you stop and think like I did.  I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying.

      I hate it.  Growing old, that is.  Other than the wisdom you acquire through life, growing old stinks.  What made me think of this you say?  I just read an email from a friend and we have been discussing how none of our old gang sees each other anymore.  I miss the days of sandlot baseball at the Ross' house from sun-up to sun-down every day during the summer (except for when my brother would go on a tyraid and end the game).  But how I miss the days of bike riding, trail riding on 4-wheelers, football in the winter, basketball in the fall and spring, and baseball all summer.  Home run derby's, trading baseball cards, and youth trips and get-togethers with the group from church.  Now, when we have time to actually talk to someone face to face, it's converstaions of how busy we are with work or school.  Even our emails are about work and school and how we don't have time for anything anymore. To be a kid again for a week, just imagine the possibilities!!

      Til you bleed!  No, I'm not talking about the imposterous C & C Music Factory.  I'm talking about my beloved Phil Jackson and his L.A. Lakers.  Come on boys, is it too much to ask you to play a little defense once in a while.  If they keep this up the rest of the series, not only are they going to lose in 6 games, but they are going to cause me to have a stroke.  Now I'm all for a good close game every now and then, but not every time you step on the floor.  Phil's real men (Jordan and Pippen) would have never caused their fans to have coronaries like Kobe and Shaq like to do.  I really hope that they are not relying on last minute heroics or luck to win them every game in this series.  Step up guys, and play ball.  FOR 48 MINUTES!!!

           Good morning.      I woke up this morning and the first thing that went through my mind was that 4 months ago today my grandpa lost his battle with cancer.  He actually won in the long run though because at last he got to come face to face with the Savior he had preached about for so long.      What is it about our grandparents that make us hold on to memories of them closer to our hearts than other friends and family members?  I remember all of us grandkids sitting around the breakfast table on Sunday mornings and Pa would sing to us.  I remember trips to the farm to check on the cows.  I remember hearing his passion in the pulpit and feeling his love with every hug and pat on the back.  I think my fondest memory is hearing his booming voice every time I walked in his house, "Hello Jeremy!"        Lots of time too, I feel that I have to live up to the legacy that he left behind.  He was like the Elvis of Paris, everyone knew him and everyone wanted to come hear him.  I don't know of any other preacher who had more visitors come to a revival than home church members simply because of who was preaching.  As soon as it was printed in the paper that H.D Hudson will be doing a revival, it was almost standing room only.  When he started preachig at Oak Grove, Sunday School attendence was in the low 30's.  A year later, it was over 100.  Now I know that God was doing all of that through him, but I guess since I always saw it first hand with Pa it hits home more.      He couldn't go anywhere without someone knowing him.  One of the last storied he told me before he died was how on the night that I was born, he and Ma were driving to Texas to see me.  They pulled over in a little hole-in-the-wall truck stop in Texarkana, Arkansas around 11:00 PM and a man walked up to him at the counter and said, "Aren't you Bro. Hudson?"      Grandparents are amazing and I'm sure evryone has fond memories of time spent with theirs.  I'm just proud that I got to spend mine with a legend.

          Hello!     To all of you who watched the horse race this weekend and pulled for Smarty Jones to win the Triple Crown (as I did), let me apologize for blowing it for him.  Yes, it's my fault he lost the race.  I jinxed him when I stood up and shouted, "He's won the triple crown" with delight after he rounded turn 4 at the Belmont.  Had I composed myself and kept my mouth shut, he would have cruised to victory, but that's how everything I root for goes!!  So if you lost money or simply were as heartbroken as I was, I'm sorry.  Next time, I'll wait until the race is over to declare a winner.

           Hello everyone.  I saw where a good friend of mine had started a blog and I thought it would be a good idea to have one so that I can come here and rant and rave about whatever I wanted.      First of all, let me apologize for you having to register in order to post a comment.  But please feel free to write whatever you want about anything I say.  Just please, no profanity!!!        I'll use this to discuss whatever is on my mind, whether it be politics, sports, anything really.  So feel free to check it out and see what I have to say about various things.    Bush and Cheney 2004!  Later!

      Hey everybody.&nbsp; I've been busy the last couple of days so I haven't been able to actually sit down and post anything.  I've been keeping a close eye on the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; I'm not going to comment much on it other than to say that&nbsp;I thought Edwards has done the best job so far.&nbsp; He is an elegant speaker.&nbsp; The only problem is, he and Kerry and claiming that they will be the ones that fix the world problems that other presidents have promised to fix and have to this date been unsuccessful.&nbsp; I'm talking about things like equal schools and a equal healthcare.&nbsp; Edwards stated that it is there goal to "guarantee that no person working a full time job will ever live in poverty."&nbsp; Good luck with that one.&nbsp; More power to you if you succeed.  What else?&nbsp; Eddie George is gone.&nbsp; He's a Cowboy now.&nbsp; I hope he runs all over us when we play them during the pre-season.&nbsp;   Well that's about all I've got for now.&nbsp; I always know of a bunch of stuff I want to talk about and then I just go blank when I sit down to write it.&nbsp; I guess I need to stop bending down and sniffing the gas fumes when I'm filling up our vehicles.&nbsp; (Just kidding)  &nbsp;

      My good friend Daniel Ross has a quote on his page every day and offers bonus points for whoever can guess the source of the quote.&nbsp; I have been trying to think of something to put on my page that might attract viewers and keep those who already view interested.  I'm not going to do trivia or anything like that, so I decided that I would put a Bush-ism on my page.&nbsp; Now, I am not making fun of President Bush, I'm one of his biggest fans.&nbsp; But to be honest, he does have very curious speech patterns and dialect.&nbsp; Anyway, I hope you enjoy.&nbsp; Tune in every day (except weekends) for a new quote.&nbsp;    It's not the pollution that is harming America.&nbsp; It's the impurities in our water and air.

      Hey there!&nbsp; I thought I would take this opportunity to put in my two cents on some current events that might or might not be true.  1.&nbsp; I hear Britney Spears is getting married, again.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe this one will last a week.&nbsp;   2.&nbsp; Is some woman claiming that she is carrying Wacko Jacko's baby?&nbsp; First of all, why in the world would someone be proud to claim that and second, who would want to be carrying anything of Michael Jackson's?&nbsp; Jacko said this story is false, but I'm not sure if it was just made up or if someone is actually claiming this.&nbsp; If you know, let me know.  3.&nbsp; Some college footbal news for you sport fans, Tennessee's leading receiver, James Banks, &nbsp;has been suspended for the first 3 games of the season (including the Florida game)&nbsp;for getting in some trouble with the police in K'ville.&nbsp; The police asked him and a group of thugs to turn down their music and he turned his up while staring at the officers.&nbsp; Sounds like his ego as a star athlete got the better of him here.&nbsp; Good for Coach Fulmer to lay down the law and teach that their are consequences if you don't want to be a model citizen at&nbsp;UT.  4.&nbsp; What else, I know there has to be more than three current events that I'm interested in.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Martha Stewart's prison sentence.&nbsp; Considering that she could have got a year and a half, she got off pretty easy.&nbsp; I'm so glad that our justice system teaches that if you are a celebrity, you can do pretty much anything you want and it's okay, we'll just slap you on the wrist.&nbsp;   5.&nbsp; I read the Newsweek article about the iPods.&nbsp; I wanted an iPod but couldn't get their stupid program to work on my computer.&nbsp; I really wanted one too.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess that's how life goes.  6.&nbsp; As a Tennessean, I have to comment on this.&nbsp; Looks like Eddie George has bought his bus ticket out of Nashville.&nbsp; The Titans are only wanting to sign him to a one year deal and he want's at least a 4 year deal.&nbsp; I must say that I side with Eddie on this one.&nbsp; The man has been a workhorse for the team and has NEVER missed a start.&nbsp; That's amazing in pro football.&nbsp; The problem is that the Titans don't have enough money to sign Eddie to a long-term deal and sign their draft picks too.&nbsp; I'll tell you one thing, if I were a Titan, I'd be volunteering to take a pay cut just to keep him on board.&nbsp; But that is not going to happen, so Eddie is leaving.&nbsp; That's a shame.  7.&nbsp; Polls show that Kerry and Bush are tied.&nbsp; I'm a bit surprised by this.&nbsp; I figured with Kerry picking up Edwards, he would surge ahead in the polls but I guess he is doing, or possibly not doing something to make that happen.&nbsp; Personally, I expect Kerry to win the election.&nbsp; As a die hard Republican, it pains me to no end to utter those words but that's just how I feel.&nbsp; Unless Bush parades&nbsp;Osama bin Laden out sometime in October, I fear that he will be moving back to Texas.&nbsp; But he will get my vote in November regardless.  Well, I guess that's about all I've got.&nbsp; If you have anything to add, feel free.&nbsp; Later.&nbsp;

      I was laying in bed last night after listening briefly to Benny Hinn (No, I don't normally listen to Benny or watch his TV program, but I wanted Whitney to see him "heal" the crowd so we turned him on for a second) and he read one of my favorite verses.&nbsp; Isaiah 1:18 says:  &nbsp;   Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.     &nbsp;  It made me think of how in the winter, the grass has died and dried up and the trees are bare and the landscape isn't a pretty sight.&nbsp; Then you wake up one morning and everything has been covered in snow and it's a picturesque scene.&nbsp; As the day goes on and you get outside, you walk in the snow and mud and distort the beauty that was once there.&nbsp; But when you wake up the next morning, new snow has fallen and once again everything is restored and beautiful again.  &nbsp;  Jesus does that for us.&nbsp; Our lives are ugly and filled with sin and really not worth looking at.&nbsp; When we ask Jesus to fix all that, He comes along, like that snow, and covers us with his blood and cleans us up and makes us perfect in His sight.&nbsp; But as we live our lives, we trample on that perfection and sling it through the mud and again dirty what He once made whole.&nbsp; The good, no, great thing is that when we ask for forgiveness, just like that fresh snowfall, He has restored you to what He wants you to be.  &nbsp;   Though your sins be like scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.

      Hey everybody.  Hope all is going well, whereever you are.  Yes, that includes you, Quincy, soaking up the sun in sunny Florida.  I am a Republican.  Don't make any bones about it and will stand by my convictions until I die.  I haven't seen Michael Moore's "Bigfatlie 9/11" and don't plan on seeing it.  That reference to it is more publicity than it deserves, at least as far as I am concerned.  Anyway, with that said, let me inform you that I will use this page to slam the Democratic party.  Just a note though, everything on here, I read off the internet.  It may or might not be true, but since a certain fat slob doesn't bother to check the facts before publishing a national "documentary", I'm not going to check facts for my limited audience.  I read the other day that the top fundraiser for the Democrats (of course, now I can't find the article but it was on Netscape Tuesday night) is under investigation for what else, prostitution.  I'm not sure if he was running a prostitution ring or just enjoys taking chances with them, but I'm sure the John-John's loved hearing this news.I'm not saying the Republicans are flawless by any means, but at least the don't continually confirm that they are a bunch of womanizers.  The John-John's held a fundraiser in New York City the other day that raised like $7.5 million.  Why such a big turn-out?  Well, the party was mainly nothing but A-list celebrities.  During his great speech, John #1 told the guests that they were "the heart and soul of America".  WHAT!!  Is John #1 saying that what makes America great are all of these people pretending to be someone else?  I thought the farmers, teachers, factory workers, police, firemen, coal miners were the heart and soul of America.  Not according to the Democratic party.  It's a bunch of celebrities out in Hollywood. The Bush campaign wants the Democrats to release the tape of Kerry saying that, but of course, they refused to.  I'm not even going to comment on the blob's "Bigfatlie 9/11" other than to say I got cracked up in court listening to some bleeding heart liberal trial ambulance chasing lawyer saying how great the film was and how it got his juices flowing and how he can't wait for the election to get rid of Bush.  The funny part was, as he was telling another trial lawyer what scenes did it for him, it was all the scenes that even the Democrats have said were not researced by Moore and not accurate at all.  Like I said, some of this stuff or possibly all of it is inaccurate, but it is all stuff I read on the internet.  If Moore is going to make up an entire movie based on lies and propoganda, then I can do it one time on my blog.    Later!

      I guess today will be devoted entirely to sports headlines.  I just read that Shaq has been traded to the Miami Heat for their entire roster almost, plus a first round draft pick.  No I guess the focus turns back to Kobe.  Barring that he isn't incarcerated, what will he do?  I'm guessing stay in LA since now that his main two rivals, Phil Jackson and Shaq, are moving out of town.  I guess we will get to see if those two truly can win without each other.  Only time will tell.

      I know my good friend Daniel Ross probably took some joy in watching the first inning of the All-Star game last night on Fox, but to be honest it kind of broke my heart.  Roger Clemens got drilled, probably even humiliated in front of his home town by giving up 6 runs in the first, including two blasts from Man-Ram and Alfono Soriano.   I was indifferent as far as who I really wanted to win the game, since I root for the Yanks as much as I do for the Cardinals, but I was really wanting to see Clemens come out on fire.  Instead, he came out and got fired on.  Maybe he'll get another chance in Game 7 of the World Series.

      Hey there.  That is how my mother always answers the phone when I call her.  I guess after hearing it for 24 years it has worn off on me because, as anyone I email knows, I start just about every email with those two words.  Anyway.  I thought I would dedicate this entire blog to my stepson, Gavin Cade Veazey.  I have mentioned him here and there but never elaborated much on his behaviors and tendencies, so I'll do that here.  I remember Whitney commented to me one day before we got married that she didn't believe that I could love Cade as much as I would love my own children someday.  Just for the record, even though I don't have any children yet, let me go ahead and put that myth to rest.  I see him as mine.  I tell everyone that I meet that he is my son, not stepson.  If they want me to elaborate then I do but I claim him in every way, shape, and form.   My favorite thing that he does is call out to me.  His speech is improving every day but I'm really going to miss hearing him call me "Doddy".  I started out as Daddo and then one weekend after staying with his biological father, I became Daddy, only he has a hard time pronouncing "a" sounds so it comes out as doddy.  We don't know what graduated me from Daddo to Daddy, but I am glad we did.  Sure, after a hard day at work and all of the stress that comes with my job, my patience is spent somedays by the time I get to finally see him but nothing brightens my day like walking in hearing him playing with Whit.  His favorite thing to do when he hears the door shut is run and hide so he can surprise whoever is coming in the house.  That usually consist of sitting on the couch and throwing a blanket over his head.    I know now why parents use the old proverb, "This is going to hurt me more than it does you" when dishing out punishment.  Nothing in this world makes me feel as low and depressed as when I have to raise my voice at him, or put him in time-out, or the absolute worst, give him a motivational pat on his hind-end.  When he hurts, I hurt.  When he cries, I want to cry.  I can't hug him enough or give him enough kisses to make the hurt go away, for him or me.  I know this has been sappy and sensitive, but I don't want any doubts as to how I feel about Gavin Cade Veazey.  I love him with all my heart and that love will never decrease, even when I do have "kids of my own" someday.  I've already got one son of my own, no matter what blood or hospital papers say.

      No, I didn't get confused when I titled this entry.  I have noticed recently that an overwhelming number of country music stars are starting to sing songs about faith. Gone are the days when all country music was about was cheating on your spouse, or your dog running away, or a pickup truck. Now yes, there are still songs like that being recorded but many country performers are starting to dig deeper and sing of their faith, or at least the faith of the songwriter.  Randy Travis has gone so far as making the jump from country music to country gospel. His song, "Three Wooden Crosses" is his first big hit of the transition, and though it takes a couple times of listening for some people to understand the story line, it is a great song and won him the CMA for song of the year.  Joe Nichols new song titled, "If Nobody Believed in You", ends with mentions of how God is no longer allowed in our schools, or government buildings, or even in our pledge. He ends the verse with the question of how much more of this will God take. The chorus goes like this:  What if God quit trying/And He just walked away/There were tear drops on His face/Tell me how would you feel/You'd probably give up too/If nobody believed in you.   I think my favorite new song is by Joe Diffie. His latest release entitled "Tougher than Nails" is a story of a boy who gets beat up coming home from school. His dad catches him going out the back door with a baseball bat to defend himself and the father teaches the young boy the teachings of Jesus and how He was beat up and bruised but He was tougher than that . They hit Him and He just turned the other cheek/But don't think for a minute that He was weak/Cause He showed them in the end that He was anything but frail/They hammered Him to a cross/But He was tougher than nails .  CMT had a special on discussing the controversy that Mel Gibson's  The Passion of the Christ  raised. Several country stars, including Sara Evans and Rascall Flats, talked about their faith and how these days it is a big risk to stand up on stage and say the name of Jesus and tell what He's done in your life but it is a risk that they are willing to take day in and day out.  Christianity and country music have never been on opposite sides of the fence. The Statler Brother and the Oak Ridge Boys probably have more gospel albums out that they do country albums. But never has such a large number of mainstream artist sang so openly about faith. And again, I realize that this might not be an exact representation of how they feel as artists but rather how whoever wrote the song feels. But it is still a big gamble to record something like that and put your name on it.  I would like to end with a lyric from a country song back in the 90's from a group who never got the recognition that I thought they deserved. Confederate Railroad was the first group that I ever heard that used Jesus in one of their songs. For that, and to all the others who have done it, I applaud you.   Jesus and mama always loved me/Even when the devil took control/Jesus and mama always loved me/This I know.

      Hey everybody!  I thought I would spend some time today talking about something that surely all of us have gotten caught up in at some point, urban legends.  What makes a good urban legend?  I have several theories.   First, it has to be something that is outrageous in thought, yet leaves the small question of "What if" if your mind.  Second,  it has to appeal to our desire for suspense.  Like ghost stories and such, it has to appeal to our sense of fear.  Finally, it has to be something that, for one reason or another, we have to be able to reason it out and convince ourselves that it really could have happened.  So what are some of your favorite urban legends?   Here are a few of mine: 1.  Pop rocks and Coke.  We all know this one.  The myth that if you eat Pop Rocks candy and then drink a Coke, your stomach will explode.  While outrageous, it is believable due to the sensation in your mouth when eating just a couple of Pop Rocks.  Surely if we eat the whole bag and then chug a Coke, our stomachs can't take all of that popping and fizzing and will blow up.  2.  The murderer in the back seat.  This one simply scared the you-kow-what out of me the first time I read it.  It's the classic where the pretty young college co-ed pulls over at a gas station and goes inside.  They find her body all hacked up a couple of miles down the road because a maniac murderer crawled in her back seat and killed her.  I know women who still do a thorough search of their vehicle before getting in it at night due to fear that someone is hiding in their floorboard.  3.  I think the most compelling urban legend I've ever seen is the supposed picture of the man standing on the observation deck of one of the Twin Towers.  Below him is a jumbo jet flying directly toward the Tower.  I remember being floored the first time I saw the photo, only to find out later that it was a fake.  But still, if I were to see it today I would probably still just stare at it in awe and think how incredible it was that the camera wasn't destroyed when the building collapsed.  Well, those are just a couple of my favorites.  Mine are kind of old and I'm sure that there are new legends floating around out there.  Feel free to add one that you have recently heard or put your favorite on here too.  Beware the man in the back seat!!!

       It's hard for me to explain why we need to make tax cuts permanent.  It's kind of some of the things that happen in Washington.  On the one hand, they taketh away.  On the other hand, they giveth.

      Hey everyone.  I can't believe it's August.  Where does all of the time go?  Anyway, there is alot going on in sports these days so I thought I would give my take on things I've seen or heard.  1.  Nomar is now a Cub.  I'm sure long-time Cubbie fans are counting the days now.  I know they are like 10 games behind the Cardinals in their division, but they are still set to make the playoffs.  Believe it or not, 10 games back is good enough for second place.  Perhaps Nomar will be the clutch player they need in the postseason.  Could this mean the end of the Curse of the Goat?  We'll see in late September.  2.  It's quickly approaching my favorite time of the year, college football season.  My UT Vols aren't even in the AP Top 25 (at least they weren't the last time I checked) and are ranked 14th in the coached poll.  Still, I am looking forward to tuning in every Saturday to watch Big Orange Football.  I am even planning to attend a couple of games.  Their home opener is on my birthday this year, September 5.  Just a hint if anyone, WHITNEY, needs any ideas for a gift.  3.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. has fallen to 3rd in the Nextel Cup Series Championship.  He has had two poor showings since having to vacate his car early in the last couple of race due to severe burns on his legs he suffered while racing in California.    He promises to be back to 100% for the Brickyard 500 next weekend at Indianapolis Motorspeedway.  Hopefully he will be able to rebound and start a streak of Top 5 finishes.  I am pumped about October because it will be the return of the Buckelew's to Talladega.  We have tickets in the Annison Tower and being that we are all Little E fans, we will be pulling for him to come away with another win at the DEI dominated superspeedway.  4.  Finally on a sad note, Mike Tyson got knocked out this weekend.  Do you remember when the meer mention of that man's name sent fear racing into every heart?  I do, but now it's the punch line to many jokes.  I remember watching the begin of Iron Mike's demise.  I belive it was the first fight he had with Holyfield.  Not the ear biting fight, the one before that.  I know that Mike has dug his own grave so to speak, but it really is sad watching what used to be the greatest fighter ever now reduced to somebody elses punching bag.  I remember my dad coming in and waking me up at like 11:00 one night when I was about 11  to tell me that Buster Douglas had knocked Tyson out.  I thought I was dreaming.  I remember sitting in front of Harrison Cowan's Nintendo playing Mike Tyson's PunchOut.  One punch from the man and I was outcold.  That is the only game that it literally took me YEARS of practice to finally beat.  I've got alot of good Mike Tyson memories.  I doubt that he'll be able to bounce back from this last defeat.  I hate to see him go out this way.  Well, what is your favorite or most memorable Tyson moment?  Good or bad, please share.  Hope it's not too hot or humid whereever you are.  Later.
