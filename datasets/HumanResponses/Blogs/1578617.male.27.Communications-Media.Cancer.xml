      I finally saw the movie 'The Postman' on TV today. I haven't read David Brin's novel, so I can't comment on its faithfulness or otherwise thereof.  I remember hearing that the movie was pretty universally panned when it came out, and I must say I can see why.  As a post-apocalyptic scenario, the world depicted in the movie has obviously regressed back to a stage of technology and society that seems closer to the American Wild West than the sort of future vision sf movie-makers are so fond of.   There is a fair amount of action, but the action isn't really the focus of the movie. In fact, the climax of the movie occurs when two opposing armies line up on a battlefield, and then, instead of proceeding with the usual bang-up battle, the two generals decide to have a one-on-one duel instead.  Finally, the message of the movie is not some impossibly complex pseudo-philosophy - it's as simple as the belief that common decency and basic human values are what define us, and what will give us strength and preserve us through the hardest trials.  It's obvious that a largely technophile, cynical and adrenalin-addicted critical machinery would find much to pan in this movie. Personally, I found that there were several self-indulgent patches, like the scenes with Tom Petty, a few overly-convenient plot twists and of course the kind of knee-jerk patrotism reflected by associating the national flag of a particular country (the US, in this case) with this sort of message makes me instinctively uncomfortable. On the other hand, I was quite amused to find that the movie's villain, the magalomaniac Bethlehem, treats what appears to be a typically desultory self-help book by one Nathan Holm as his Bible. I've always felt that those positive-thinking people are going to create a monster some day, and Bethelehem is exactly what I'm expecting. Having said all that, I basically enjoyed the movie. It seemed to veer rather close to the sort of thing you see on the Hallmark channel, but it basically is a good movie experience and a good story.

      I just suddenly had this probably very silly thought...it's as if we're all nymphomaniacs (actually, I guess that would have to be satyromaniacs) who've found employment in the flesh trade...and it isn't working out quite so well as we'd expected. Well, at least speaking for myself anyway.

      writing is something i'm expected to do.  writing  is something i want to. i write enough on demand. anything you want however you want it. reliable? flexible? scalable? campaignable? that's what i do because i have to. and then there's the stuff i  write  because i want to. not because i'm expected to. i value what i  write , more because i have no obligations to anybody to write it, i owe it to nobody and more importantly there are no deadlines. i am my own. and when i want to write for myself, i don't want anyone else's restrictions pinning me down. guess many of us feel this way..... writing  comes from within, not without...it's written because i like it, not anyone else. it's spontaneous, not mass-produced. that's all i guess...just another passing thought on the monitor...

      Contrary to popular perception, I will not talk about Matrix Reloaded (it doesn’t matter, there is no spoon any way).  When I wanted, I couldn’t. Now that I can I don’t want to. Greater minds than mine have already done it better than I ever could. Just one thing though. Neo is a program.  Moving on to other things or rather just one: Requiem For a Dream. If you have seen it, see it again. If you haven’t, what the hell you waiting for? A modern masterpiece with no matrix-type frills this movie is one that makes you take a long hard look at yourself and your addictions. So much so that for a while when the movie was still fresh, I was considering quitting chicken. Then the tongue took over.  But all said & done, at first glance Requiem is a tough pill to swallow (pun intended). Then it all sinks in. Based on Hubert Selby Jr’s novel of the same name, this has to be Darren Aronofsky’s best movie yet. It’s all about drugs and addictions. Stark in its outlook, the whole movie is one relentless sensory assault that makes you butt out that cigarette you’re smoking right now.   The movie is about 4 people. Each with their aspirations for and perceptions of greatness. Till drugs get in their way. It’s about Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto of Fight Club fame), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans of I’m-Damon-Wayan’s-brother fame), his girfriend Marianna (Jennifer Connely of Beautiful Mind) and most of all, and in a bizarre twist, his mother Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn).  For a movie that starts with a split-screened crime, this movie just goes on to higher things. Especially amazing is how we never really see the characters (except Sarah) do drugs, the director uses a very novel visual mnemonic to convey a lot of things besides this. Hysterical, unreal, surreal, frightening. That’s what this movie is. With a brilliant background score to boot.  From how Harry and Tyrone get a hit, get high, get going to Marianne’s slow and steady addiction to Sarah’s equally low & steady downward spiral this movie has it all. From a kooky self-help game show that initiates Sarah’s spiral to perverts out for a good time. Watch out for these things though: the (wo)man-eating refrigerator, the addict-exploiting black (didn’t catch his name). It’s worth a see. And if you’re of masochistic leanings watch it back to back. So although I can go on, in the interests of winding up I leave you with this: www.requiemforadream.com (just go with the flow of the website's flash and you'll get it)  PS: How the fuck did Julia Roberts win an Oscar that year, with Burstyn around? In my highly-humble opinion, this movie should’ve made a mark on the Oscars.

      My friend Toto has kindly offered to put up some of my mumblings on Hypnos, his music review site (see link in right side panel), the ones that he feels are of interest to his audience. It's not so big a deal in the larger cosmological scheme of things, but it made me feel good anyway. More details as and when they arise. Thanks, Toots! In the meantime, Gautham Shenoy, where are you? It's safe to share your views on The Matrix: Reloaded, now...

      Nice to have you around, man. How's IBM treating you?  Yes, the subjects we studied in old JPEng did give us an interesting grounding in some very basic areas of human experience...if only to realise that little as we know about these matters, the experts, apprently, know even less! And it's comforting to know you are very upset, too... I've always liked your poems - the few I've seen at cul-fests and trawling through your left-over files back at Opus.  Throw some more at us!

      Greetings fellow obscurities, Funny that the title of this 'blog' seems really clear to me. So much, i almost feel overfamiliar. Am honestly tickled pink, with so much literature by an unquestionable enigma (that may be only for the sophomores you knew, jp; as our senior, we could never read you). And as it seems, all of us walk the same path - in/about/over thought; communication (students of the masses that we tried to be); language (passed all these amusing accents, including them from down under); and behaviour (thanks to our greatest subjects combination for bachelor's degree: Journalism, Psychology, and English). To keep discussions running, with frustrations and anxieties over affairs of this state of our mediums, I assure you all that I am incredibly upset too. But for now, this is a short poem (seems like one, though it means very differently to me):  	can hardly explain it  		the grand old debates; 		are you able to understand  		exactly what i mean?  		words fail  		at the footsteps of feel.  		so humanly  		vain are they: 		to draw it all, yet reveal nothing.  		ah.  		(how many words can describe what i feel)

      Well. I went to theater. I saw it. Huge chunks of machinery were blown up. People drove vehicles recklessly and at insane speeds. Various intricately-orchestrated battles transpired. One totally irrelevant rave-party spliced with deeply emotional love-making scenes gyrated across the stage.  All the old Plot Devices - the One, his Mentor/Prophet, his Woman, the Oracle, the Agent (now able to endlessly replicate himself, but to no avail since he keeps getting thwarted anyhow) are back.  A few new Plot Devices - The Keymaker (who even admits to his nature as a Plot Device, telling Neo when asked "How do you know all this?', 'It’s my purpose to know these things.' Exactly.), some older programs, gone renegade and turned into Decadent Aristocrats, one of whom trades the Keymaker to Neo in return for a kiss (really) and yet another portentous polysyllable-spewing cardboard cutout, the System Architect.  While we're talking about the System Architect, I must say any scriptwriter who puts the word ‘ergo’ into someone’s mouth not just once but twice in the course of the same scene is just wanking. Much of this movie could be dismissed as wanking, by the way. The even more stunning set-pieces, the intricately choreographed fight sequences which seem to extend beyond the demands of mere plot, functioning as a sort of balletic ars gratia artis, the portentous pronouncements by Morpheus (which can be summed up in a few simple phrases: This is a war. Neo is the One. We are all soldiers. We will win. I believe.), the Supermanesque (or should that Supermanly? Damned if I know)  flight scenes, all they achieve is to up the spectacle-factor. On another level though, this movie genuinely takes the story-arc further, adding satisfying ambiguities and uncertainties to the first film's fairly simple, messianic storyline. Neo is the one, but no one, even himself, is sure quite what that means or what he will achieve. The introduction of the concept of endless recurrence makes one wonder whether there is any real freewill or purpose in all this. At this point, Neo clearly makes a choice, choosing the moment, the human element, the love of his woman over the chance to start again with a clean slate. But, as the Oracle tells him his choice was pre-ordained. The important point is to understand why he has to make the choices he does. Beyond the illusion of freewill lies the challenge of understanding. And so forth. All in all, a very thrilling experience, and also satisfying to me because it takes the premises of the first part to new, interesting places. On the downside, a lot of the acting and dialogue is flat, the style cannot hide a certain paucity of substance (particularly in those inane speeches by Morpheus and the Architect), Carrie-Anne Moss just isn’t that pretty, and thank (insert appropriate cosmic force here) the last part is coming out late this year, otherwise we’d all have just too long to wait for resolution.  I’m being rather kind about the movie because it is willing to ask tough questions and mostly doesn’t resolve them with pat answers. Mainly, it’s only a movie and I expect far less out of SF movies than I would from the written word, so any intelligence at all is a happy surprise. I doubt I’ll bother to watch it more than once though. Apart from the gut-level thrills, most of the more cerebral content in the movie has a high decay-rate.

      Another day gone by. I was extremely unproductive today. There's something about totally tech writing that numbs my mind. Fortunately, the people I work with recognize this and intend to get someone with a proper tech writing background if we get more of this sort of work.  Also, coordinating an entire project, small though it may be, is turning out to be extremely exasperating. The sheer number of phone calls I have to make, to take just one example, is incredibly disturbing. And then I have to talk to each individual in their own vocabulary – the client, my designer, the tech guy…oof! Well, I’m finally going to go see The Matrix Reloaded tonight. Expect nose-in-the-air comments and general intellectual  urlLink onanism  tomorrow.

       urlLink The Agony Column Book Reviews and Commentary    This site has reviews of books from various genres, but basically avoids the vast over-hyped wasteland of mainstream fiction. It covers sf, fantasy, horror, mystery and certain kinds of non-fiction, eschewing 'fat fantasy' and cliched space-opera. I haven't been able to research much into it's antecedents, but I did my usual trick of searching out reviews of certain specific books and comparing my own views with the ones in the reviews. It's a totally subjective method, I realise, but everyone needs a yardstick and  urlLink I am mine .  It takes a little while to figure out how to find exactly what you want, but it's worth the effort.

       urlLink  The Physiognomy – Jeffrey Ford    The blurb announces that this book won the Fantasy Book of the Year Award 1998. Despite that, it seems like it might be worth reading. A fan of Tolkien and  urlLink  Eddisson  , I've come to view the contemporary fantasy scenario with some chagrin. Endless epics that seem to go nowhere, made-to-order trilogies, childish humour and weak plotting masquerading as Douglas Adams-style comedy, and an overall tendency to cater to the kind of people who generally want a lot of battles and intrigue but think the usual Jeffrey Archer-type stuff is infra dig. I still get suckered into trying out some of those books now and then, but on the whole, I’ve decided to stay away.  Ford’s novel however seemed to have the sort of off-kilter, daringly inventive premise that writers like  urlLink Iain M. Banks   or  urlLink JG Ballard   specialize in.   The world Ford describes actually falls somewhere in between a sci-fi world and a fantasy one. An interesting hybrid. And thankfully, there are no magicians/sorcerer/dragons/magic swords or other  urlLink well-tempered plot devices.   The story itself revolves around Cley, who is also the narrator. Cley is a master Physiognomist, trained to detect all there is to know about a person from the disposition of their external features. Nose-to-chin ratios, that sort of thing. He is in service to Drachton Below, a sinister figure who rules the Well-Built City, which itself was constructed by Below in the image of his own mind, something like the  urlLink  memory palaces  used by some medieval scholars as a mnemonic device, only made concrete in a reversal of the usual process.  Cley is sent to a backwaters town to investigate the disappearance of a religious artifiact, a fruit, apparently brought back from Paradise. He finds this assignment extremely unpalatable and shows it in his dealings with the townspeople. In fact, Cley comes across as a brutal, arrogant character in this part of the story. Various incidents transpire, culminating in his mutilation of the lovely Arla, a remarkable intelligent woman with a surprising talent for physiognomy, and various other significant connections.  The second part of the story deals with Cley’s incarceration on a prison island, Doralice, accused of treason against Below, and the transformation he undergoes there. This was where all forms of dissidents, including his own mentor, were sent to work in the sulphur mines, until they died. Most of the previous inmates were sent here on the strength of Cley’s investigations. Now, in the same situation as his own former victims, he finds his alignments changing, and his always-fragile loyalty to Below crumbling. Each prisoner in the mines was assigned a particular tunnel. Walking down the tunnels made by dead prisoners, he finds each of them has transformed the inside of his tunnel to reflect his own thoughts, ideas and dreams. The experience gives Below a new insight into them. Simultaneously, there are a lot of odd things taking place on the island – a sentient monkey, Silencio, who becomes his main companion, and is apparently the true ruler of the island, a Night Captain Matters and a Day Captain Matters who are either brothers or two different manifestations of the same person. The whole atmosphere is very  urlLink Kafkaesque  , and also comes close to the deranged but oddly convincing reality you might encounter in the works of  urlLink Gabriel Garcia Marquez  .   Eventually, Cley is granted a reprieve by Below, recalled to the Well-Made city with all charges against him dropped and his position reinstated. Now comes perhaps the weakest part of the novel. Cley, increasingly disgusted with Below's megalomania, begins plotting against him in secret and becomes involved with some sort of numinous resistance movement. Eventually, Below is defeated, the City destroyed and Cley and his accomplices escape to a pastoral idyll. The ending seems to be a cop-out to me – an oddly  urlLink  Luddite,   anti-technological denouement. Cley's ultimate ineffectuality as a protagonist is also disappointing - he does not really do things to shape the plot, especially in the final section.   Although the quality of Ford’s prose and his sheer conceptual inventiveness remains unbroken through the novel, I got the feeling he lost the thread somewhere and quickly drew the plot towards some sot of ending. This is one book that really could have been spun out a bit further.  So this is an intriguing, exciting, but ultimately unsatisfying novel - a flawed gem, if you like. I’ve oversimplified things in my review- many significant characters and incident are left out. But I think my conclusion is fair enough. However, this is apparently the first volume of a trilogy. I haven't yet been able to get hold of the other two books, but if nothing else, this one has convinced me that the effort will be worth it.

      ...helps keep me sane.  I'm a firm believer in plain English. Simple, meaningful statements that actually communicate. Unfortunately, in this catchphrase-driven, buzzword-ridden world, that attitude doesn't really go very far. It goes about as far as my own personal communication and writing. When it comes to the stuff I write in the profesional arena, there are expectations to be met. My client expects to see those inane phrases and acronyms, which is fair enough in a way, because HIS client expects to see those inane phrases and acronyms. If I sit and write a brochure for a tech company in plain, deconstructed language, it just wouldn't make business sense for the tech company. I personally feel the semantic content of human discourse is being devalued (there I go with my own personal jargon) but there's little I can do about it. So I've had to accept a compromise - between getting all worked up over it day in and day out, or gritting my teeth and plunging into the world of arbitrary neologisms and barbaric, rigged-up phases. Ultimately, it's only a job. In my own free time, I'm free to write or speak the way I want to. One day, perhaps, I'll be in a position to buck the trend, in whatever small way I can. In the meantime I build a wall inside my head and endure...

      After putting together the little sketch I call 'imaginary rock n' roll conversation', I suddenly wondered whether Rob Trujillo actually has dreadlocks. I did a  urlLink Google image search   and found no evidence. However, I seem to recall seeing an Ozzfest video where he very clearly had dreads. Or am I fooling myself? Who knows. It was a good gag, anyway....

      Handwriting is any day better than Arial...hmmm. Have you seen  my  handwriting lately, Shenoy? Seriously, although I emotionally identify with what you're saying, I can't really agree. There's always an affection for the older way of doing things, because it has been around for so long and we've built up so many associations towards it. But every new method is an opportunity to translate those associations, to perform the same human actions in new and sometimes better ways.  The Indian Post could never have achieved the miracle of letting my friend Anand in Qatar tell me about my friend Vinod in London's wedding reception in Bangalore in time for me to contact Vinod and find out when and where.  There's the touch!   Also, I would compare your argument to one that I came across somewhere in Plato, where this person criticises the invention of writing, because it allows people to note things down, eliminating the need to consciously recall those things. He felt it would result in people using their minds less and less.  In actual fact, the development of external memory devices has only freed the human mind to use its processing power to better effect.  I've always been a science fiction fan. I really believed the world could become that way, in my lifetime.  Well, I'm still waiting for the space age to happen.  But in the meantime, the communication age is one thing that  is  happening - and it's up to us to seize the opportunity to use it the way we want to.  Got any thoughts? You can call me, mail me, sms me, or just walk into the place where I live and tell me yourself - whatever seems to be the easiest, best way to get in touch with me!

      (Midnight in the Osbourne Mansion. A phone rings.  Ozzy  picks it up)  Ozzy:  Hello?  Jerry Cantrell:  Ozzy, it's me, Jerry.  Ozzy:  Jerry!? Do you know what time it is?

(He hangs up and lapses into an incoherent stupor. Phone rings again. He picks it up...no rest for the wicked, you see)  Ozzy:  Hello, Ozzy here.  James Hetfield:  Ozzy, it's me James. I need a new bassist!  Ozzy:  You, too?  James Hetfield:  U2 needs a new bassist? What do I care? I'm a Metallicat!  Ozzy:  Ah, never mind. What happened?

Well, thanks Ozzy.  Ozzy:  Anytime. Bye. (He hangs up. Stares vacantly into oblivion. Suddenly, a look of confusion spreads across his cretinous features like an oil spill creeping across a mud puddle.) Bloody hell!

      Handwriting is any day better than Arial. The monitor is a bad substitute for a letter. And messenger doesn’t even come close to a telephone conversation. And I’ll wish you with an e-greeting…get the drift? Technology was supposed to make life easier, but better? Hmmm…like who cares today to take a sheet of paper and write a letter, when you can send e-mail? When was the last time you read a letter? When was the last time you posted a greeting. Yeah, so hotmail is easier and cheaper than the Indian postal service and ditto for messenger and the telephone department. But where’s the personal touch in all this? Case in point: there was a time when a friend and me (you know who you are) used to take a piece of paper and fill it with lines in turns, hoping to see a poem by the time we reach the end of the page. Today I’m invited to blog to do the same thing. Nice. Very new, very interesting. I’m game. Anyway the end is the same. But what about the means? Aren’t we missing something here? Doesn’t anyone miss putting pen to paper anymore? Well, I’ve rambled enough, I’ll stop. You start thinking. You got an opinion about this? Get in touch with me. Don’t call me, I’ll probably be busy.

      it's kinda tough finding good scifi/fantasy content on the 'net, because a lot of sites cater to the movie/tv scifi fans as well, and a lot of other sites tend to pander to the 'mainstream' crowd, the sort of people who reckon that Robert Jordan is the greatest fantasy author alive, for instance. Well, I've finally found a site that lives up to my standards - the reviews are by far the most insightful and useful I've found, the feature articles and interviews are of a high standard and they have a HUGE collection of very good scifi short stories up for online reading.

      At some point during the convoluted history of the European intellect, many wise men thought that Hebrew was the primordial Divinely-endowed language of mankind, bestowed upon the first man by blind old Nobodaddy, YHWH himself. It was further thought that if a human child was brought up unexposed to any linguistic stimuli, she would naturally speak Hebrew.  Now we know that if a child is not exposed to language within the first 5 years of life, it's likely she will never be able to speak. The basic capacity for language in the human sense may be wired into our brains, but it needs to be activated before a certain date. Mowgli may have been able to grunt and growl with his jungle friends, but once he followed the little girl back to her village, he would find it exceedingly hard, and ultimately impossible, to learn to talk to her or anyone else. The amazing thing about this is that, contrary to a reality that could probably be rather easily discovered, savants of the highest scholarly distinction seriously believed that a child could speak any kind of human language without some training. We believe what we want to, and we know or think only what our beliefs allow us to. It's better to believe in as little as possible, I believe.  Yes, I've been reading  urlLink Umberto Eco!

      I've been noticing how my various bosses over the years have dealt with me, each in their own unique way. The first one quickly set himself up as a mentor, spending long hours giving me in-dept lectures on various conceptual issues related to the business we were in(this was an ad agency). He used to make me take notes and rate my progress on a quarterly basis. It was a bit suffocating at times, but also very exhilirating because I really was learning a lot. Of course, it meant I'd have to spend that much more time balancing following up on our learning sessions and turning in work that lived up to my 'intrinsic ability' and reflected the added gyaan he was giving me. My next boss followed the Socratic method. Whatever I showed him (this was an ad agency, too), he'd wrinkle his nose, mumble 'fruitcake' and then require me to do it all over again. He'd keep trashing my work and then around 11.00 PM, by which time I'd given up all hope, he'd say 'Okay,you can go home now. But you have to finish this job by tomorrow.' Pause. 'One way or the other.' So I'd go home, tormented tired and frustrated. Smoke a spliff, listen to some Tool or Tea Party and crash out. The next morning, realising the damn job still had to be done, I'd randomly scribble stuff in my notepad on the way to work and hurl it in his face. He'd look at it with an oddly sentimental expression on his face for about half a minute and then say, 'Right. Make it so.' I'm not kidding, he actually used to say that. He was a big Star Trek fan, the only reason why I forgave him for also being a Bee Gees maniac. The odd thing is, this pattern happened for EVERY SINGLE job he gave me. The results were amazing, but the emotional stress was just too much. My current boss (this one is a web design company)seems to revel in heaping an entire brief on me, saying 'I want you to be the point man on this project,' and then occasionally sticking his head into my cubicle to grin and remind me of all the upcoming deadlines and, oh, by the way, here's a new project. Then he sticks around for a while explaining how he sees me functioning in the larger strategic scheme of things and encouraging me to interact more with the client and basically try and read their minds while I'm at it. I guess it's their job to be bossy, all these fine gents, but I can't help but wonder if perhaps I'm being singled out by all these people for particulalry mind-warping treatment.

      I studied journalism back in college. Plus, my dad is a journalist. The overall impression I've been able to form of the profession is that it's about gathering and dispersing timely information to the masses. Fair enough, right? Apparently, that's all wrong. As Douglas Adams observed, newspapers, magazines, TV news channels, they all actually exist as a means to deliver an audience to their advertisers.  Fair enough. But at least the pretext thereof, the news, is still the news, right? Wrong, again. The name of the game is PR, not journalism. I used to work in the ad biz. At that point, I wrote several press releases for clients. And found that the press just reprinted them verbatim, without even checking my facts. That was my first shattering revelation. I know it seems all very naive, but I was rather dissapointed. Especially when one of my releases appeared, virtually unedited, in my father's newspaper under his byline. Who do you trust anymore? Still, the couple of little changes he made to my copy were for the better, so at least my respect for the man as a wordsmith goes undamaged. I later spoke with other friends of mine in the journalism racket, and they told me they rarely touch releases because the advertisers might get pissed. Ah, so. Well, this was a more general intro to the fact that I think there is something rotten in the state of the press. What I really want to do is share a specific incident regarding a wannabe glossy entertainment mag and the nascent Indian rock scene. Await my next installment for all that.

      It was worth it. I normally don't enjoy these rock shows at music stores - all those racks get in the way of the stage, there's far too many people just generally elbowing in to gawk for a while in between looking for the latest pop fix and so forth. But motherjane made it worthwhile. Much as I respect support blah blah the perennially beleaguered Indian rock scene, there are, in reality, only about 6 or 7 bands that I actually find worth watching. motherjane is definitely one of them. Their style is mainly thinking-man's melodic hard rock with tasteful traces of prog, funk, classical  and metal. It probably isn't the sort of stuff that's my mainstay these days, but its always heartening to come across a band with high standards of lyrical and musical content. They're also the only band in India right now with a song that I can relate to my own current life  - 'Prison Chains', a song about ...work.  Their album, Insane Biography, enjoyed rather good production, courtsey Didier Weiss, a French-expat who now lives in Auroville and was also responsible for the studio polish on Thermal And A Quarter's second album, Jupiter Cafe. The high quality of the package just made it easier to appreciate the sterling values of motherjane's sound - their brand of hard rock gets you with the grooves and the riffs and the melodies, but it also offers lyrical and musical niceties in plenty - a healthy overdrive,so to speak.  The most amazing thing is, they are fully capable of delivering all this finesse and fire live. They know how to get a decent mix out of the PA, the musicians are at ease, in control, channeling rather than just playing their songs. The two-guitar team works brilliantly - they may be one of the few bands here that knows how to really make use of two of those creatures to seriously mix textures and parts and genuinely add to the song beyond the comforting wall of sound a second guitr provides. Vocalist Suraj just never fails to amaze me with his ability to effortlessly to deliver every pitch, every little nuance of the vocal lines you hear on the album. Another great thing was that they played a totally original set, except for the apparently obligatory Iron Maiden encore (Be Quick Or Be Dead, this time). When they followed it up with their own song, Disillusioned (which by the way, I just heard my friend Jack has written the script for the video to), it was clear that they should stick to playing originals - thats where they really gel, competent as their covers are.I think thats a good sign - it means they very definitely have their own 'voice'. So it was good. I'm glad I went. Let's hope there's more of the same to come...more real shows by worthwhile bands, not just cobbled-together media-friendly issue-based gigs, 'corporate' rock shows (oxymoron if there ever was one), old farts playing lounge rock and of course the usual kids experimenting desultorily with various shades of metal. (I just had to say something negative about SOMETHING sooner or later!)

      Well I'm off to see  urlLink motherjane  playing at Music World, the first concert I've actually felt like going for since the  urlLink Cryptic show . Motherjane should be worth it - the album (Insane Biography) was really good, great songwriting and great musicianship, but the last show I saw of theirs was just ok. Well, I'll find out now, won't I?

      I realised my taste in music has become totally non-generic.  Once upon a time, if I liked a band, I would find out what genre they were and try to find other bands like that. Now, that seems a very silly plan to me. Why on earth would you want to listen to a band that sounds like something you've already heard? These days, if I like a band, I try and find the rest of their albums.  Full stop. If I find another band that sounds like them, especially a newer band, I tend to ignore them. Examples: Coldplay, Creed, Godsmack. I just couldn't care less about these three bands, seeing as how I can listen to Radiohead, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains instead.  Of course, Coldplay is the only one in the lot who are actually any good, but even so, I'm just not interested.  Similarly, I don't identify my music taste by genre anymore. Once upon a time, when asked what I listen to, I'd say 'metal' or 'grunge' or whatever. Now, I just give the questioner a quick cross-section of what I'm currently into (say, Radiohead, VAST, Beck, The Tea Party, Tool) and let them figure it out.  No conclusions being drawn, just reporting. Still searching for sound underground...

      Some day, perhaps, we will replace our brains with highly advanced, super-miniaturized computers. The operation will take place at birth, the cranium sliced open, the fleshy mass removed and in its place a silicon marvel that will integrate with the nervous system, become the organism’s mind, grow with it, just like the mind the organism was born with only faster, more sophisticated, with a larger memory, a wider repertoire of functions and the ability to interface directly with cyberspace. A mind that was designed by intelligent research and invention rather than the thoughtless currents of organic evolution.  When that day comes, people will wonder how primitive man ever got by with a mere fleshy brain. Unfortunately, by that time, we will be buried so deep under the debris of time we will never have the chance to tell them.  Will these people, with their upgraded minds, their superior software and hardware, will they be human in any real sense? Or will they be less? Or more? Or just plain different?

       aha?   in the beginning was the word; that was never understood, then attributed to supernatural forces, and finally consigned to fate.   jp's musings about re-starting (per se) civilisation, on some uninhabited stretch of time (if we ever discover such a thing), interested me most in the idea of having to begin/create a new language altogether ... the thought of being at the point of creation, before any concept of history itself.   (however, musings apart, being grounded in the age we belong to, the suggestion actually transformed (for me), from considering rescheduling/reinventing time, to the need for being timeless, as such.)   the idea immediately led me to a certain north american tribe, discussed in detail by terrence mckenna, about this particular language/tribal tongue that has no words; a language that is completely based on (physical) expression, and phonemes.   the subject leads on to language, and the significance of onomatopoeic speech, as of natural expression.   there is so much to discuss therein, that i have already decided to abandon this piece.

      That’s how much of everything you can peacefully ignore in this world we have made without missing out on anything new and interesting. 99% of music, books, movies, technology, politics, people.   People most of all. The tricky part is, it isn’t very safe to ignore that 99%. That 99% could very well be the new universally accepted fascist norm that you had better find some accommodation with or retreat from if you want to survive in any meaningful way. Eternal vigilance is the price of intelligence.

      Behold the void. It lies concealed within every facet of your life. Extrapolate that, run it through every possible scenario. Find the yawning abyss grinning its untenanted rictus at you from every crevice. What then is our burden? To trudge through the inane wasteland, grasping at straws and chasing after a safe shelter from the storms? To roll with the nameless ageless tides, the random currents, seeking our own paths of least resistance? To grin back, and let the emptiness breed within? Or dare we consider this universe a challenge, a gauntlet thrown in our faces? Shall we fight back and strive to inscribe significance into the swirling mists?  Or isn’t that what we already do by the very act of existing?

      Imagine if you could start it all over again. Just you and around half a dozen other people. Men and women, boys and girls, washed up on some unknown shore, dumb, naked but blessed with all the native ingenuity and inventiveness of this human species. To create language, art, science, technology, culture, society, law, the whole deal, from scratch. Blessed with a racial memory of this world, our world, the one you were in before, what would you do differently, what subtle chains of events would you set in place to ensure a better future than this one?  How would you prevent your language from degenerating into a tool of control and misdirection, your art from lapsing into a sterile formal travesty, your science from wandering into dead-ends of false paradigms, your technology from expecting humanity to serve it rather than vice-versa, your culture from spiraling into contexts for more control, more intolerance, your society from arming itself against diversity and change, your law from decaying into an ad-hoc system of quid pro quo? And even if you could, would you want to? Would you want to sacrifice freewill to create a deterministic world, no matter how enlightened and beautiful? Think about it, and let me know if you have an answer.

      I just had to quote this. It's off her  urlLink site.   'Socrates said, "The misuse of language induces evil in the soul." He wasn’t talking about grammar. To misuse language is to use it the way politicians and advertisers do, for profit, without taking responsibility for what the words mean. Language used as a means to get power or make money goes wrong: it lies. Language used as an end in itself, to sing a poem or tell a story, goes right, goes towards the truth.   A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. By using words well they strengthen their souls. Story-tellers and poets spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper. '  Amen to that.

      Christopher Evans' Aztec Century (winner of the 1992 BSFA Award for Best Novel by the way) is a bit of a mixed bag. Its alternate-history premise is sufficiently compelling - the basic 'what if' being that the Aztec (or rather Mexicana) empire has colonized Europe, and the rest of the world, rather than vice-versa. This allows for a lot of ironic, satisfying (to a non-white like me, anyhow) inversions and variations on our own world, with popular video games showing noble brown-skinned warriors combating evil Caucasian adversaries, Acapulco taking the place of Hollywood as a motion-picture centre, Cola Cacao soft drinks and MexTaco fast-food chains.  The world depicted by Evans seems to diverge from our own around the 16th century, with Hernando Cortes choosing to betray his own nation to serve the Aztecs and be with his Mexicana lover. Simultaneously, the microbial aspect of the early contact between Europe and South America is reversed, with Europeans being exposed to a debilitating New World Plague that weakens it to the point where the Aztecs are able to take over.  There are a lot of other differences, too, and the great thing is the way Evans slides in little details (the portrait of a Russian tsar by one Dali, a work of art by a Warhola who later goes on to become big in animated cartoons)  that add up to a rich, if largely impressionistic picture. Britain is subjugated by the Aztecs right at the beginning, and the novel follows the travails of Princess Catherine, a British royal. Captured by the Aztecs, she is surprised by their oddly humane treatment, and drawn to the charismatic Aztec governor, Exteban. But, alone among her family (including the simple-minded heir, who agrees to become a 'puppet king' and marries one of the Aztec emperor's daughters) she continues to hold out. She is convinced that there is a dark side to Aztec rule, for all there apparent civilization and the veneer of Roman Catholicism that overlays religious beliefs. This is where the book looses some of its charm. The almost-love affair between Catherine and Exteban results in trivializing a lot of what happens.  The plot itself, like the world-building, is apparently rich, but somehow shallow. At the very end, after enduring various vicissitudes,   Catherine finally consents to wed Exteban. At that very point, she discovers, through her insolent yet loyal (yes, that really is as far as his character goes) manservant, Bevan, that her husband, Alex, presumed dead in the defence of Scotland and sister, Victoria, presumed exiled to Shanghai for treason against the Aztecs, are actually alive and well and living in the Aztec capital. They have both betrayed her, in many different ways. In a rather convoluted attempt to avenge herself against the Aztecs at last, she takes Alex away from the place where he is kept and sleeps with him. This obviously puts her impending marriage with Extepan, now poised to be crowned emperor of the Aztec empire, on the rocks, and also exposes the secret compacts they have entered into with Alex and Victoria. Terrible retribution follows, involving cannibalism and human sacrifice. The dark side Catherine has been searching for is finally found - but only because her own acts (which I find very hard to fathom) brought it on.  The ending seems rather flat - Catherine is eventually granted a degree of clemency, exiled wit her sister to an alternative Earth (our own?). However, she does not believe Exteban is done with her, or that the Aztecs are done with conquest. Having conquered their own world, it would only be logical to extend their ambition to parallel worlds - a rather common alt-history device. The ending is oddly unconvincing and open-ended. Maybe Evans originally intended to write a sequel?  Verdict: A great weekend read. Don't try and dig too deep, though.

      Consider the facts: going out in general doesn't appeal to me anymore, unless it's to spend a sunday loitering around chai joints and second-hand book stalls. I even skipped the Stones and Waters shows because I can't take the crowds and the dust anymore. I naturally tend to express myself in polysyllabic compound sentances. I drink only about once a week, and feel like I'm going too far if I have anything other than beer. By 10:30 PM I automatically start worrying about getting home early.  One thing that's remained unchanged is my now-on now-off tryst with the green stuff. But even that doesn't make me go off on a trip anymore - just makes me feel very calm and quiet. Big difference. And I seem to have little or no interest in venturing further. Plus, I get fed up when I come across people glorifying substances and the experiences they have under the influence.  I'm even actually in touch with current affairs and have opinions on them.  I suppose none of this is particularly unusual or remarkable. Just that it's happening to me for the first time. The good thing is, the stuff that I always felt REALLY defined me is still in place - like my atheism, or my enthusiasm for scifi, or my somewhat dilletantish intellectual pursuits, to give a few, possibly superficial, examples.

      to all fRiends, If the world was truly perfect (and it is not) and if everyone was the same (and they are not), the world would truly be a boring place. If i was the same as you and you were a copy of me, wouldn't that be just decay in all spheres? If you had nothing to give me and i you (in actual presence and in the realm of thought and ideas), we would never be together. If you did not make me think, i would not respect you. But you do help expand my mind, so i respect you. That is why you are my friend.  It has always been one of man's oldest attributes that he wants to be the best; breaking your own boundaries is not trespassing into another's territory (or is it?). Rest assured, my friend.  And if I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise: my moods quite attainable: my demands reasonable, and I acknowledge and respect thy genius, and it is to me as yet unfathomed. Yet dare I not (or do i not have the liberty to) presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment. For, if there was no friction, never would a fire be. Or would you rather i be your yes-man, and nod my head sagely to all of your views and opinions. Would you still be my friend, still respect me, if was in agreement to all you said with no mind of my own? But i do have one. And so do you. Going back, we are not the same (similar maybe), but not the same. And that is what will keep us going.   with due apologies to mr.emerson

      I was just thinking about the subtle friction, the interplay of sublimated jealousies and malice, that often informs our closest friendships. Is there any such thing as a truly comfortable relationship?  I don't have any one person in mind, but I realised that the closer the friendship the greater the potential to hurt...it works both ways.  I have close friends whom at some level I sometimes feel are 'out to get me', to establish their superiority over me. It's very subliminal, but it's there, somewhere. A sort of jostling, sibling-rivalry kind of vibe. There are other friends I have this sudden startling contempt towards, at times, and it manifests itself in sudden outbursts of quite untoward nastiness.  And these are close friends. Mere acquaintances, I rarely waste that much emotion on them. Or vice-versa.  It seems sort of wrong somehow, but there it is.  Perhaps the true nature of friendship is that you mainly like and choose to be nice to a person despite the prickly undertones that exist in relation with any external entity.  Maybe it's impossible to totally relate to another person with no reservations at all.  If that's the case, I don't want to even try and figure how love might be defined...

      So me and my friend Prem were having this conversation during which I told him I feel metal (the musical genre) is a rather limited art form, not something you can explore exclusively for a lifetime (this is just my opinion, okay) and he replied, 'true, you have to look around and observe other textures, too, like wood, sand, plastic...' I somehow find that very profound.

      I recently had (and am probably still having) an interesting debate with a friend over whether or not Metallica's Load could be included in a list of 'essential' Metallica albums. I felt it should, he didn't.  At that point, I defined the bifurcation of our views by contending that his definition of 'essential' was a qualitative one, a sort of 'best of', while mine was a hollistic one, an attempt to provide a complete snapshot covering every aspect of the band's evolution. Actually, I've realised it goes a little deeper than that. The difference is actually between our perceptions of what Metallica the band itself is. My friend's point of view probably comes from the generic perspective, placing Metallica squarely in the metal tradition and assessing their output by the standards of that genre.  My own perspective is coloured by the realisation that human creativity often goes through radical shifts in its expression even by a single person (or collective entity)- witness Picasso's various periods, for instance.  Further, an entity such as a succesfull rock band also has to deal with its relation to a constantly shifting context of trends and styles, the ever-morphing pop-culture tapestry, and the need for a vital, growing audience.  Metallica's history over the past decade is a fascinating study in the re-invention process and offers important insights into the complex, paradoxical dynamics by which a popular art form like heavy metal evolves.  The new album, St. Anger, although personally dissapointing, is also an 'essential' part of assessing Metallica from such a perspective.  In fact, apart from Re-Load, which can be seen as an extension of Load, all of Metallica's releases in the last decade or so - the Black Album, Load, Garage Days Re-Revisited, S&M and finally St. Anger, all mark interesting transition points and cannot be ignored in any serious attempt to understand the band.  More later - it's a Sunday, y'know!

      Writing owes its origin to commerce.  Initially, our pre-literate ancestors would not have needed script - since they were limited to just that quantity of verbal information that can be stored by the human brain, they would have had no behaviours that required a larger memory. At first.  But once society evolved beyond a certain size, and a merchant class began to emerge, things changed.  Suddenly a need for measurable value emerged. Common systems of measurement seemed like a good idea. And then, the merchants needed some way to keep track of all their transactions.   This lead to the development of standardised units of measurement, the introduction of money and some way to keep track of it all.  It started with crude inscriptions scratched onto clay slabs. Simultaneously, the merchants (or their scribes) would have developed symbols to represent the different goods being traded. More symbols for the different people they dealt with. Sill more symbols for time, place, season, year...you know the rest. These odd markings that you create on paper, on computer screens, on billboards, in magazines.   Script, ladies and gentlemen - writing!  Runes and hieroglyphs, cuneiform and minuscules, alphabet and akshar.   And all because a few people wanted to sell things to may other people, and make sense of it all.  Al of which makes it kind of preposterous to sit around here as I often do and crib about having to use writing to aid commerce. Oh well, I never said I wasn't going to be a preposterous man...

All the old anger came rising up ... I flung things around, yelled at granny and stomped off.  I didn't know I still had it in me...it really is about time I moved out, I think. Then I'll only have myself to blame, whatever happens.

      Somewhere in Ken MacLeod's Cosmonaut Keep, one of the two protagonists (his surname is Cairns - both their surnames are Cairns - and at this point I can't recall which was which) describes software project management as being akin to herding cats.  If you've ever been owned by a cat, you'll know what he meant.  I would like to extend that analogy to web development team management. I've found myself in a lot of odd situations in life (bassist for a death metal band, writer lost in an event management company, left-handed atheist in a largely right-handed, theist society and on and on) but this has to be the oddest. I'm currently apparently co-ordinating the total re-vamping of my company's website. Believe, this needs to be done.  It's a web communication/technology company, and the team I have to work with includes a mix of techies, designers, management, and IA types, so as to reflect all the aspects of our business and to actually get all aspects of the job done.  It's a juggling act and a roller-coaster ride rolled into one. It's like herding cats and dogs simultaneously and a herd of pissed-off, underpaid underfed maths teachers and all their squabbling, screaming 11-year old students at the same time.   My only option is to dig down deep and kick serious booty. Today, after a week and a half of getting ground-level inputs from everyone, I held the first actual action meeting.  We covered a whole lot of ground and have actually emerged with a plan and concrete actions to be taken, which is still slightly miraculous to me.  And of course we all have our ongoing actual work for our clients to contend with at the same time.  And I have Scylla and Charybdis to deal with - two deceptively small-seeming projects that have been entirely placed on my narrow, quavering shoulders.  If all this goes through succesfully, I think I'm going to apply for that job herding cats.  Interested?  Drop me a line!

      Today, our Foreign Secretary, Kanwal Sibal, says 'the Government in the stages of assessing and evaluating the situation in its entirety.  He said there were also "grey areas" and "unresolved ambiguities" in the United Nations resolution on Iraq that would have to be addressed and clarified before any formal decision could be made. ' He's just pussyfooting around the real issue here - sending our troops in is just a form of selling out, becoming another US puppet-state, and we want pats on theback from the UN before doing so.  And the REAL issue, as far as our esteemed-I-think-not-Govt. is concerned?  Here's a clue: "...Whatever decision India takes, I don't think it will have an adverse effect on our relations... we are on our way to developing an increasingly cooperative relationship and no single issue will determine the quality of our relationship," Mr. Sibal said.' And another: 'On the subject of the High Technology Cooperation, Mr. Sibal said that the old days of Washington pressuring New Delhi to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty and Fullscope Safeguards were no longer there. Rather, the two sides were into a robust dialogue involving the private sector on a range of high tech areas that included, for instance, in the first meeting here, information technology, life sciences, nano technology and defence technology. ' That's right. All they're worried about is bodyshopping. braindraining, call it what you will, more of our finest minds, to the US in return for cold hard dollars.  All the quotes here are taken from The Hindu, by the way. That paper also has a very kickass  urlLink editorial  about the whole issue. Read it!

      I've decided to wait a bit before putting the Burroughs piece (whichis finished and not too bad at all if a bit derivative) up. At least let the people who asked me to write it get at it before I do the subversive criminalenglish thing and put it up here, free for all to see. In the meantime, I've been blisfully mailing it to various trusted friends for opinions, of course. Another interesting project that may happen - the guys doing the Hypnos Comix (a collaborative horror/comedy story on the Hypnos message boards that I'm supposed to be part of but have been very lazy about) are interested in actually making it into a comic. So I'm meeting my friend George who is interested in doing a comic with me in any case, with the script on Saturday. This has also inspired me to search through all my old data CDs to dig out these 'Stagfger Lee' storylets I'd done a couple of years back (a sort of Burroughs-pastiche action scifi conspiracy paranoia adventure thingy) because those would make a good comic too. You see, Gotham, the people who publish Marvel and DC comics out here in India are currently talent-scouting. So... Also, I need to follow up my projects with Prem, fellon (the Burroughs-soundgarden connection) and End.   Hmm, there's a lot of Burroughs in there.

      I read in the news today that the Indian government 'appears to have decided not to say "no" to the United States request to send troops to Iraq as part of a "stabilisation" force...this did not mean that "as of today" India had taken a decision to say "yes" to the U.S. request either. '  Without even commenting on the wishy-washy doublespeak and second-guessing those few words embody, I must say I'm deeply troubled at the fact that we may send troops in to Iraq.  Saddam Hussain was certainly no saint, as these things go, but make no mistake - the so-called 'war' in Iraq was an invasion, no matter how much the UN is now tying it self up in loops to white-wash the whole shennanigan with that immensely digusting document, the   urlLink U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 . And Iraq should be defined as occupied territory.  Sending our troops there, whatever the reason, will only be a further validation of the evil empire's right to coerce, invade and destroy any inconvenient nation.   I don't mean to go all Arundhati-Roy here, just expressing my chagrin without expecting a Booker for it.

      Well, another day ends. Without the crutch that heading down the pub to drown it all in beer used to provide (I still do drink, but not all that much), perspectives shift a lot. I can actually look at the evening as an opportunity for personal growth or at least to do something fairly interesting like catch a good movie, read abit, listen to some new music. I think one of the reasons for the creative dry patch that I'm still creeping out of was that whole phase of stupefying myself with beer and reef every night. There was no longer any meaningful content in my life...nothing new coming in except the beer that got pissed out the next morning anyway.  Running from myself is the best way to run away from anything I might ever want to be.  The stupidest thing is, I knew better and I still lived that way for months on end. I guess I just needed to get that crap out of the way once and for all.  Lessons learned...?

      On August 27, the planet Mars will be closer to Earth than it has been in more than 50,000 years. The planetary event will enable the public, space enthusiasts and astronomers to view greater detail on a planet that is increasingly seen as humankind's next giant leap.  Bright red-orange in the evening sky, Mars will be in perihelic opposition this summer, meaning the celestial body is at a point in its orbit when it is both closest to the Sun and to the Earth.  -Press Release, The Planetary Society  More info on the Mars Watch  urlLink website .

      Sometime halfway through the previous century, a few scholarly, inspired English gentlemen set out to create totally imaginative works of fiction weaving together various pet obsessions and interests. JRR Tolkien combined his fascination for Norse legends and the study of language to create a fictional language, a world for it to exist in and charecters to populate this world with heroic deeds and noble quests. On the other hand, ER Eddisson wove together a love for ancient poetry, particularly the works of Sappho, a tendancy towards esoteric metaphysical musings and sundry other pet obsessions into some of the most labyrinthine, intricate and obscure fiction ever. And look at the state of the legacy these literary mavericks have left us - poorly-written unending sagas of turmoil and conflict in paint-by-numbers worlds, read by a passionate following of retards who seem to be fully capable of following all this faff and minuitiae with the same misplaced zeal with which a housewife follows the unending sorrows and incests of her favourite soap opera characters. And the swords. Shit, why does anyone think totally imaginary sword forms are so very fascinating? Do they see them as some sort of zen metaphor for life? Do they even have a life? The only fantasy author who should be allowed to write about swords is Michael Moorcock. The rest of them should come no closer to one than having one dangling over their neck when the latest pile of turgid crap they're penning starts reaching the 500-page mark. Fantasy is supposed to be about imagnination and wonder, not taking all the petty turmoils and intrigues of our mundane reality and just transposing them into a quaint medievalistic world with a magic in the place of technology and a few exotic races like elves and dwarves to compensate for overall racial homogenity of the human characters in these deeply Anglo-Saxon (or at least Eurocentric) imaginings. Sadly, the dynamics of the marketplace being what they are, it looks like everything breaks down into its simplest, lowest form faster than you can say 'entropy'.  Just a general spew. I needed to get that off my chest. Phew...

      The gap between this album's release and its arrival in India gave me time to read every single review the Internet had to offer. There are some seriously overpaid hacks out there, if they're getting paid at all for all this babble.  When I finally got hold of the album (I'm fairly sure I was the first person in Bangalore to buy a copy!), I decided to approach it with no pre-conceptions, except I followed my friend Prem's suggestion to start with Myxomatosis before proceeding through the rest of the album. Let's do a quick run-through. 2+2=5 starts with the odd, abstract sounds that Radiohead have been specializing in lately. Then, it turns into a satisfyingly tuneful, coherent song which suddenly warps into a whole new zone as Thom Yorke reminds us that 'you have not been paying attention'. Wonderful, inspired madness follows. Off-kilter, weird, but an actual SONG after so long! Then there's Sit Down Stand Up, a chilling look at control and power which culminates on Yorke repeating the word 'raindrops' about 47 times for no other reason than that he thought it sounded pretty. It does. Sail To The Moon is a fragile, piano-led ballad, the sort of thing Coldplay are making a career out of copying. There are some beautiful, atmospheric touches but the song fails to entirely cohere into a satisfying whole. Next comes the first real clunker of the album, the boring, mechanical Backdrifts. 'We tried but there was nothing we could do', the lyrics inform us, apparently relating the band's inability to do anything useful with this song. We're quickly back on track with the magnificent Go To Sleep, which begins with a beautiful, flowing acoustic pattern that reminds me of The Tea Party or acoustic Zeppelin. A genuine masterpiece with traces of all the various feels Radiohead can explore. The jury's still out on the next song. I personally like the U2-ish almost-ballad Where I End And You Begin, but two of my friends, from different ends of the musical spectrum, dismiss it as froth. Ah, well.  The next song, We Suck young Blood has great lyrics and a very promising musical soundscape, a promise Radiohead fails to deliver on. The eerie, cinematic backdrop fails to coalesce into a meaningful sonic experience. The Gloaming is just plain avoidable. There There was the first single off the album, and deservedly so. One of the stronger songs in the album, it includes my new favourite Radiohead lyric: 'just because you believe it, doesn't mean it's real'.  I Will comes across as mere filler, mainly because it's so short. Then again, it could also be because I'm primed to expect the epic mode from Radiohead, and this is instead a neat little haiku. Punchup At A Wedding, as its subtitle suggests, is a no-no. Its not a bad song, but it is distressingly pedestrian, in spite of a rather nice bass groove. Then the Godzilla fuzz of Myxomatosis comes stomping in. There's a reason why I was told to hear this one first, and I'll leave you to discover it yourself. The album maintains an even level for the remaining songs, the wistful, haunting Scatterbrain and the strangely Dylanesque (my opinion) closer, Wolf At The Door. The one thing most of those reviewers I plowed through have totally overlooked is that this album is a conciliation, a bringing together of the various tangents the band has taken in the past. The beginning of a new synthesis, perhaps.  There's a little too much dead air to call this a genuine classic, but there are at least 7 very good songs here, and the makings of what might be a whole new phase of consolidation for Radiohead.

I'm trying to fight back, rally the folks who I know will prefer a more reasonable timing to log on and vote, but I'm afraid it's a rearguard action and too little, too late. Sigh.

      It's odd how money is the one thing that always attracts money. Three months back, when I was hauling ass all over this town doing scads of freelance work in the hope of scoring some survival-money, none of my payments were happening. Now that I have a dayjob again and am quite comfy, sangkew, all those old payments come pouring in. It's nice to have money anyhow, but where were they when I really needed them?  Conclusion: Continue doing the freelance work. Basically, no complaints if it means so many more random packets of hard cash hitting me at odd intervals.

      Yesterday, I met my old friend Chaitra, who returned a few CDs and tapes that another friend, Anand Pillai, borrowed from me some time back back couldn't return on his own seeing as how he had to push off to Doha, Qatar (right?). It's nice to have my Dream Theater : Awake CD back, but even better to have Rush's Signals back. In the prog sweepstakes, I greatly prefer the older vintage. Meeting Chaits was a good steal. In the 3-4 years since we all left college, a lot of the people I knew have changed, and not always for the better. Chaits has stayed the same - a little serious and earnest, but with a certain wry humour of his own. I was especially thrilled to discover that he's been on a voyage of discovery into Indian philosophy/spirituality, particularly from a Dvaithist,or Dualist perspective (which posits that the individual human soul is DIFFERENT from the supreme over-soul, which it canonly strive to realise, not become), as opposed to the Advaithist perspective (which holds that the individual soul and the supreme soul are actually one).  A lifelong atheist, I nevertheless have the keenest interest in genuine spiritual ideas from our past, as opposed to the pop-and-glam Sri Sri Ravi Shankar variety.  We had a fascinating conversation - I listened more than I spoke - and I hope to have more over the months to come.

      Education is the number one cause of ignorance in the world today.   This isn't just a pithy little epigram (original to me, by the way, as far as I know) that I like to throw around because it sounds cool. It's TRUE. I don't know about the rest of the world but it's all too true here in India. The syllabi we learn are not just out of date or innacurate, they're warped. The teachers aren't just mediocre, they are actively dangerous. It's all pathetically, tragically wrong.   Consider: I recently saw a 2nd/3rd class English reader, prescribed by the State Govt. of Karnataka that actually used the word 'fishes' as the plural of 'fish'.   Consider: A friend of mine just wrote his IAS exam. One of the questions was 'The Aryan Race Is...'. You were allowed to choose from options like 'a racial group', 'the supreme race' and so forth. Disgusted my friend went for the closest option - 'a myth' - which he probably won't be getting points for.   Consider: I studied English at a BA level. If I had confined my literary explorations to my syllabus, I would have left college,a  21-year old English graduate with no knowledge of Beowulf and Chaucer, a general feeling that Shaw and Wilde were as contemporary as it gets and a vague inkling of Joyce and Elliot as something firghteningly cutting-edge. And this, in the year 1999. Warped, I tell you.  Consider: I was introduced to some basic concepts of relativity by the TV serial Cosmos when I was 6 or 7. It was a a very basic idea, but I've since been able to confirm that it was a sound one. In high school, however, we were just taught good old Newtonian physics, whichis admittedly good enough for most things, but you'd think they would give us an inkling of the new physics, at least to whet our appetites for more.  Consider: I also studied Journalism, which  included a segment on mass communication, in that godforsaken BA course. But I'm reading Vance Packard's 'The Hidden Persuaders' for the first time only now, 4 years down the line. In college, it was just one in a list of books we had to mention in our answers for more marks. No one ever bothered to motivate me to pick up the books and read them myself -and what else is a teacher supposed to be there FOR? To mark attendance and dispense trauma, I guess.  I could go on citing instances of how our educational system actively promotes ignorance and misinformation. But you get the idea.  I could say that the answer is educational reform.   But it isn't - that'll never last, never work.  What we have to do is make our minds, and those of our children (as and when they happen) OUR responsibility. Sure, go to college, get those little letters tacked on to your name so you can get a job later. A career is a very important part of any life, after all. But, to paraphrase Mark Twain (whose works, again, I did NOT study in that pathetic BA course), don't let your schooling interfere wiith your education. Knowledge may be the only true source of power left to the common individual in this shoddy world we have built. Pursue it. Educate yourself. Please...

       urlLink  How to Build a Time Machine by Paul Davies  .  The first time I read HG Wells' 'The Time Traveller' was in one of those 'classics in comic form' type editions which are ostensibly aimed at kids, but actually serve as a very good starting point for people of any age.  The story was really more about HG Wells' surprisingly (for those who think of him as the father of SF and identify him with a blithe 19th-century materialistic rationality) pessimistic view of the human future. But what stayed in my head was the idea that there could be a machine that I could step into and use to steer myself back and forth on the currents of time.  The next time I came across concepts of time travel was while watching Carl Sagan's tv serial, Cosmos. It was the episode that discussed Einsteins theories of relativity and their many implications. Most vividly, the concept of time dilation. I realised that this was a neat way to jump into the future but, as long as there was no way to journey back into the past, it would always be a one-way trip, not real SF time-travel. In any case, we are all time-travellers in a sense, being constantly hurtled forward into the future by entropy. Time dilation is just a way of getting a jump on this flow by tying yourself to the speed of light. Even if we could achieve lightspeed, or near enough, we would just be leap-frogging ourselves into an unknown future with no return tickets. It might make for some very interesting adventures of a pioneering kind, but it certainly wouldn't be the sort of time-travel practised by, say, Doctor Who.  But is it possible to travel to the past? Does it still exist somewhere, in some form? And wouldn't going back in time violate certain basic aspects of reality, like the second law of thermodynamics? Paul Davies briefly describes how travelling back in time may be possible, within the field of influence exerted upon space and time by a rapidly spinning body of sufficient mass. But basically, he does not seriously discuss any way to reverse the flow of time itself or travel directly to the past from the present. What he proposes, instead, is manipulating space, matter and energy to create a stable tunnel , or wormhole through time and space, allowing lightspeed or near travel to some future point in time at some distant point in space.  This wormhole would then serve as a two-way path between these two points, finally allowing us to travel from a future date to one in the past just by turning round and returning form the other end of the wormhole. It would still be impossible, however, to travel to any point in time BEFORE this marvellous conduit was created.  There's a lot more detail to it of course, and a few points that I need to read a few more times to fully figure out. The amount of conceptual ground covered in this simply-written, elegantly laid-out book is quite amazing. Nearly every angle on the whole conundrum at hand is explored through the speculations of sceintists like Einstein, Godel and most recently, Kip Thorne (who actually developed the wormhole concept because his friend Carl Sagan wanted to make the wormhole portal in Contact as theoretically sound as possible).  In the process, we are treated to quick overviews of the basic ideas of relativity, quantum physics and black hole theory, amng others. The author also does a quick round-up of various famous time-travel paradoxes (all of which are immensely familiar to any dedicated SF reader) and the currrent thinking about them. Lastly, he points out that time is an integral component of what we call the 'fabric of reality'. Even if time-travel does eventually turn out to be impossible, as scientists like Hawking and Wheeler have suggested, research in this direction helps us push at the boundaries of what we know about some very large, basic forces and could well be a key to that scientific Grail of Grails, the grand unified theory of everything. Stranger things have happened. This book is a bird's eye view, a good starting point. It made me think and it made me wonder. I get the feeling it doesn't dive too deep into certain esoteric points, or into a few alternative models of time-travel.  In many ways, this book was like one of those 'beginners' classics' I alluded to at the beginning - a solid, if basic grounding that leaves you with a good conceptual framework for further exploration, more voyages into time space and the mind.

      After a few days of silence, the whole contentious issue of Indian troops being sent to Iraq has surfaced in the papers. (In the meantime, the centerstage has been usurped by the Ayodhya issue - another deeply shameful escapade).  Today the Indian Army laid out a couple of options of the terms under which it is willing to embark on this adventure. If the chain of command is kept strictly Indian, they will be willing to send in a mainly combat oriented outfit. If not, the forces will consist of largely medical teams, ambulance squads and suchlike. Either way, they've neatly sidestepped the opportunity to take a stronger stand.  Plus, who exactly is paying for it all, whatever form of troops we send in? The taxpayers of this nation. Who aren't even being asked what they think.  So much for democracy. Like the man said, what we have here is demoncracy. Still, I have some hope yet that this ghastly mistake won't be committed...we wait and we watch and we hope to see...

      Not really the promised review - just a few stray thoughts provoked by a couple of movies (X-Men:2 and Matrix:Reloaded), related comics (in the case of X-Men) and 'the critical legacy' thereof. (Which reminds me - you know those 'Essential Criticism' books you see, which contain critical essays about authors like Aldous Huxley, Virginia Woolf and so forth? I must do one like that for a comic or a rock band (maybe Radiohead) one day)  I notice that X-Men:2 (X-2) has been pretty much treated as 'just entertainment' in comparison to the other big sf-flick of the moment, Matrix:Reloaded (M:R). Maybe it's because X-Men are only a comic book, while the Matrix sequence is rapidly emerging in the light of a latter-day Zen koan, a flashpoint for all manner of metaphysical mutterings and a template (I should be kind and say 'inspiration'?) for a whole new breed of action flicks.  When it comes to that last point, X:2 has its fair share of thrilling eye-kicks - Nightcrawler's assault on the President of the USA, Magneto's airborne escape from captivity (which is pure comic-book magic), Wolverine's duel with Deathstrike and that truly awe-inspiring dam-break at Alkali Lake. (heh...rhymes)  For me, the most rivetting scenes in the movie were when Dr. X stops time in the museum (I just get a kick out of it...it's not a part of this discusion), Wolvy's battle (spliced by the way with an equally exciting confrontation between Jean Grey and the brainwashed Cyclops) and that dam-burst.  These are very different from the stand-out scenes on M:R. Even though the battle scene involves posthumans with strange powers, it is basically a one-on-one face-off, hand to adamantium-clawed hand. All the action in M:R takes place in a virtual environment (The Matrix, boisungurls!!!), between avatars of humans and manifestations of software programs. Similarly, the 'big picture' for me in X:2, that dam break, depicts a primal force of nature - water - unleashed in all its raw fury, not some coded event in a cyber environment.  And that's a clue to where this movie is coming from, what it's really about (apart from being a bloody good super-hero adventure). The fundamentally shaky premise - the X-Men are supposed to be mutants, but there's no logic to it, no pattern that fits any known mechanic of mutation (but, hell, what d'you want from a comic that was created for kids - Isaac Asimov?) isn't important compared to the immediacy of the very strong story and the very human question it hinges on - that of tolerance in diversity.   This isn't explored or shown as well as it could be - none of the mutants, in fact, seems to really face the amount of discrimination that, say, I as an Asian would face in the USA. There are instances of harrasment - in the museum canteen - and betrayal, but they are rather sanitised and pat. Then again, it could be because the X-Men have more or less isolated themselves from the human mainstream in the ghetto that is Professor X's Institute. Still, it is a major message of the movie, and in an age when old-fashioned xenophobia is re-asserting itself in an increasingly globalised environment, this may be a more pertinent message than any amount of musing on the 'fundamental nature of reality'.   Magneto and Professor X are central points in this context, as they embody two opposing reactions to the experience of discrimination - Magneto has no patience for the pettiness of humanity, and wants to get on with establishing a mutant earth. Professor X, of course, dreams of an eventual reconciliation and in the meantime, a respectful distance and dedication to serving all humanity. Knowing that both their goals are quite far off, they both choose to from isolated groups of mutants, cut off from mainstream humanity.   What really brings this vision to life are of course the sterling performances of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. They bring a poise, dignity and almost Elizabethan (dare I say Shakespearean?) presence and verve to their roles and take the movie to a higher level.  Equally vital is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine - about the first time I've actually preferred the movie version of a comic book character. I could write paragraphs about how cool Wolvy's charecter and Jackman's interpretation thereof are, and how much they contribute to the movie, but you get the idea.  Nightcrawler is another gem, and with his deep religious faith, brings in a few interesting angles to the big issues of discrimination and intolerance.  Lastly, the women in X:2 totally kick ass, the ones in M:R are just no contest. Storm and Jean Grey are lethal, leather-clad bombshells, Deathstrike is all that AND an adamantium skelton, Rogue is just so adorable and Mystique is bluer and nuder than ever. The sad thing is two of these hotties die in the course of the movie. Damn...

      A friend and me were chatting about this shop where you get really cool clothes at really good prices. They are mostly unbranded clothes, the deal being that these were clothes that were made for but rejected by big-name brands. Although they are rejects by those standards, it's nothing you or I (people who arent that much into clothes) would notice. And the price is great.  The thought then occured to me that, after two or three breakups, I'm now in the same position in the - ah - romantic market. A reject, but probably good enough by the standards of girls like you, and you (purely hypothetical), who aren't that much into guys anyway...

      Today, I had to meet someone at Prestige Meridian, on MG Road. For those of you who don't know, Prestige is a bigshit construction company in Bangalore, Prestige Meridian (PM)  is a bigshit commercial complex and MG Road is the biggest bigshit road in town  The person I had to meet was a bit late, so I decided to try and find a phone booth and call him. Turns out, PM has a bank (or 2), a chic coffee shop, some trendy furniture showrooms, various high-powered coporate offices but NO telephone booth.   Eventually, I had to walk down to a cigarette shop down the road. The guy had not just one, but two coin-phones.  None of this would have been an issue if I had a cellphone. But I don't. And you'd think a company like Prestige would keep in mind such possibilities while contructing something of this scale. Nevermind the 'customer-centric' shit, it would at least be a source of additional revenue, however small.  I guess the problem is, for all the lip-service done towards 'customer satisfaction/delight/ecstacy', in reality, these people just don't give a shit.

      This is the letter my grandparents in Madras (Chennai) wrote to The Hindu. They've said it all, better than I could...  Sir,  Congratulations on your forthright editorial, 'Don't send Indian troops to Iraq' (July, 4). It is high time India shed equivocality and disclaimed any part or lot in what is one of the saddest misadventures of our time - the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq. It was a needless war. Admittedly, Saddam Hussain ran a tyrannical regime. But it had a saving grace; it was not a fundamentalist state, nor did it breed terrrorists to the extent that America's friends, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, have done. In any case, replacing bad rulers is not the job of the US or Britain.  Now the Anglo-American 'coalition' has got into a mess, which is worsening by the day. It is not the Indian Army's job to act as 'charladies' to do the cleaning up. Our sally into Sri Lanka was both a mistake and a tragedy. Let us keep that warning in mind. The Indian Army should not go to Iraq to kill or get killed. Both ways, there will be unhealthy religious backlash.   India can and must offer peaceful aid - food, medicine and technology.  All aid must be clearly labelled 'From India, with friendship'.  -Lakshmi Krishnamurthi & K. Krishnamurthi, Chennai

      The Analyst learned that the sky was getting lower each year, by about 3 inches a year. Fast-forwarding the scenario in his mind, he realised that this meant the sky would probably come crashing down in exactly 67 years, crushing all beneath. So the Analyst did what anyone would, he published. Then, the Editor found the Analyst's article. It was a slow news day, so he edited out the equations and put it in his paper, with a suitably thrilling headline: 'Sky is falling, says noted Analyst'. The People read this report and were frightened. Many of them just read the headline and went running into the street to tell their neghbours. A great national furor ensued. Then, a Leader was caught having sex with an underage girl in his car; everyone moved on.  A few years later, poeple remembered the Analyst's warning, or at least the version in the headlines. They noted that the sky had not, in fact fallen. They re-named the Analyst the Alarmist and proceeded to lambast and satirise him. They were still doing so 65 years later, hunched over and stumbling through their strangely contracted world in which THE SKY HAD NOT YET FALLEN.   Oh yes, this is original to me.

      Life carries on, you know? The point is, will you?  I have found it's very easy to be cheesed off and contemptous about the 'system', but then, where's the action? Either you break away completely - and I mean completely - or you choose to find a niche from where you can sustain your own idiosyncracies and maybe fight from within. Everything else is a cop-out.   Just clinging on apathetically in the interest of sustenance and confining your own expressions to a small incestuous circle of insiders - that doesn't make sense. Yes, anything really new and creative will probably only have a parallel audience at first. But go find that audience, don't just get caught up in the equally empty confines of some safe 'underground' niche.   I am slightly groping for the concept I'm trying to express. Expect more clarity as I achieve it.

      I find it increasingly amazing how little people want out of life.   A safe pre-packaged identity, a comfortable niche in a non-threatening professional and personal environment, a set of aspirations picked up from the mass barrage, a life that needs minimal original thought and effort to play out.  Few people seem to want to genuinely grow, learn and evolve, to constantly challenge themselves, their ideas and their beliefs. They would prefer to subdue their own innate capabilities (if any) to merge with a safe environment. They would rather stick to a tiny circle of people who offer no threat to their fragile egos and accepted world-view than seek out new, interesting people with different kinds of ideas and thoughts.  They would rather waste their time in inane hair-splitting, in chasing down beaten tracks and confusing a limited sort of skill within rigidly defined parameters than truly explore the broader universe of ideas and expressions.  They just want to build a cozy little box, line it with some straw, crawl in and nail the lid shut. Fuck them. I have no time or patience for fools anymore.

      I find it interesting to note how the commercial mainstream tries to trivialise  urlLink Vance Packard   by saddling him with a term like 'pop-sociologist'.   His book, The Hidden Persuaders, is not a work of social science scholarship at all - examine it in that light, and it falls apart. Too anecdotal, too subjective. What it is, is a knowledgable, concerned person's report on a distressing trend towards mass manipulation that began in the US and, like other American products, has spread to the rest of the world courtsey globalisation.   Although Packard slips into excessive paranoia now and then with his 1984 allusions, and overrates the efficacy of the 'hidden persuaders' methods (half a century later, they still haven't got it quite right, though they are much slicker now), he isn't that far from the truth. Although he wrote in the '50s his core message is still all too applicable.  He offers no solutions to address the ills he speaks about. That, like academic precision was not his aim, obviously. Packard's role was/is as a signpost, making us aware of several realities of today's media/political/corporate culture, leaving it to us to decide how to deal. In a world where knowledge itself is a a precious commodity, that is a sterling service.

      I’ve always liked comics. As a kid I pored through Disney, Indrajal, Amar Chitra Katha, Tinkle, the occasional short-lived DC franchises and whatever ‘phoren’ stuff came my way. In more recent years, I’ve had friends (one of whom I still have to return 37 comics to - damn!!!) who scour the book stores for cool comics and have been nice enough to share them with me. But the whole thing always seemed a little too random for me – you never get issues in order or a whole storyline, that way.   Now that Gotham is releasing comics, sequentially, and consistently, I feel like a kid who has been given the keys to the candy store. Sure the selection is limited only to the Marvel and DC mainstays, but finally, I’m able to pick out a Conan or an X-Men or whatever and know that I’ll be able to follow the story through. I can start collecting favourite titles. And special issues. And occasionally get some really spiffy posters to stick on my wall.   At last, something good is coming out of the media boom!!!  Hopefully, Gotham will soon realise that they have a discerning adult market as well, and start releasing the comics in a bigger size and on better paper.  Also, while I’m fantasising, maybe other more alternative comics will also start showing up here. That would be heaven…comic book heaven!

      I'd like to leave aside these convoluted meanderings, this seemingly irresolvable debate between narco-apologists, the anti-narc faction (ME, oddly) and the Buddha-like golden mean (thanks for jumping in by the way - I think it’s added a lot).  I’d like to move on.  And I’d like to remind all concerned that this whole debate began because of a remark I made about a set of people who aren’t moving on.   The romance and mystique of drugs, particularly weed, seems to be a safety zone for a lot of people. I’ve moved on from that. The only thing I get out of weed anymore and the only reason I occasionally patronize it anymore, is relaxation. In my experience and opinion everything else is arrant hype.  I’ve scrawled a few verses under the influence, cranked out a line of music or two that later found its way into a finished song. But the actual sustained creative effort, I’ve only done that physically sober (though often psychologically tripping on the creative flow itself). This is the perspective from which I’m coming.  The green stuff was useful at one point because it loosened up my head a bit. But in the long run, I can’t say that anything worthwhile came out of my period of frequent usage.   The few small creative expressions I’ve managed to achieve and am happy with, were all conjured up totally sober.   I don’t need that stuff to create or to broaden my mind anymore.   Most of the people I know aren’t getting that out of it either – they are just feeding their own delusions. If you feel uncomfortable with all these statements, maybe it’s because it slices a little bit too close to some rather uncomfortable truths about you.  This is going to be my last post on the topic.  I can move on…it’s what keeps me growing. Can you?

      It's not just the so-called 'weak minds', Joy. It's easy to ignore my references to what drugs can do to a person by saying, 'oh, but those are junkys'. The fact is, I personally haven't met anyone whose life has been significantly bettered, over a long period of time, by any form of sustained tripping on a habitual level.   Even in the ones who more or less have their lives in shape, there's a certain hardening of the thought processes, a narrowing of the mind. They no longer frolic free through all those wondrous realms this thing we call the mind can enter into.   Rather than sit in a quaint old cafe with charmingly rude waiters hovering around as you sip on watery filter coffee from old-mans-teeth yellowed cups, talking animatedly about the Third Reich, the crank theories of Colin Wilson, the pros and cons of the big bang theory, the subtle defects of libertarianism, the state of rock n' roll, the counter-dimensional art of MC Escher, the political scene or maybe just the contents of the afternoon's meal or hey did you see that girl I think she's looking at me no she's looking at you, these people whose lifestyles revolve around a regular intake of any narcotic are more commonly to be found huddled in some smoke-filled room, either staring vacantly into space to the accompaniment of some canned music that serves as an excuse not to think, or giggling like schoolgirls at their first NSync concert, cracking the most inane jokes this side of Three's Company and generally raising serious doubts as to whether there is, in fact, intelligent life on planet earth.  This isn't arrogant opinion, mindless appeal to authority or whatever - it's an observation I've made after years of people-watching.   The next time someone defends the narcotic experience as a key to higher mental growth or creativity, I am going to ask them - 'So, what have you learned?' Only those who have a convincing answer need waste my time further.  And yes, my definition of convincing is, like everything else about me, subjective and opinionated and self righteous. it's as simple as this - if I think it's an insight I could not have realised myself without a narcotic of some form bubbling in my head, I will gladly concede the point and cease to believe that drugs are, ultimately, a dead-end for human evolution.  Any takers?

      shenoy cringes and cowers in trepidation before the God of the Higher English Language. The onslaught of big-sounding and tough-looking words tears the very fabric of his reality to pieces. almost misses the cheap-trick paronomasia. almost dismisses it as the work of an unstable (as in, highly or violently reactive) mind, but then realization dawns. although the bad taste remains in mouth, he realizes that earning a living through work (except in a nerd-firm) is to be considered a sad state of affairs. suddenly realizes that unbeknownst to him greater minds have attained true immortality, divinity and YHVH-hood by doing a course in English and working in a big-name firm (quickly does google search for an (experienced) english teacher so he can attain also High Ground and also swiftly dispatches office boy to gangarams to fetch him a thesaurus).  while waiting for the thesaurus to arrive, attempts (with his pea-brained knowledge of THE language) to define lobotomy.  lobotomy: Surgical interruption of nerve tracts to and from the frontal lobe of the brain; often results in  marked cognitive and personality changes . Lobotomies fall under a category of operating procedures known as psychosurgery (brain surgery on human patients intended to relieve severe and otherwise intractable mental or behavioral problems), which in turn falls under the broad umbrella of brain burgery.  lobotomy: also known as leucotomy. But NOT to be confused with transorbital lobotomy which is a method of performing prefrontal lobotomy in which the surgical knife is inserted above the eyeball and moved to cut brain fibers  tuckered out with this bloggal ejaculation of hopefully meaningful words, looks to chai as the savior and looks ecstatic as he sees office boy approaching on the horizon with thesaurus (and a receipt for the same) in hand. quickly winds up this edition of blogging and leaves the hallowed grounds of the blog that have been sanctified by the presence of drug-dependent GOD, while all the time apologizing for the desecration of the language and the discussion.  runs down the stairs screaming "all joy to you man"

      shen oy! (like: oi! shen-oi!)  sad to say, saatch iz our state of affairs. (had to say, no reason whatsoever :)  the stable minds are most likely resting at home (is what i think), content with their own sure thoughts, doing what they want to most. (to repeat previous assertion: the minds that are most stable, are the ones buried)  that must leave all of us out, surely? (think again, and satisfy yourself well)  the world a junkyard, and all junk-laden lunatics ..  anyways, here are a few of the pointers i go by, in identifying really weak minds (call them unstable, for here):  the unstable mind needs to pick on others, finding consolation in having picked something, at least. the unstable mind relies on others, to (try and) grasp meanings out of the reach of its (innate cognitive) capacity. the unstable mind constantly refers to what others have said, to reassure the self of being correct, in some way. (the more popular the reference, so much the better)  (c'mon now .. every mind is unstable in some way or the other .. it's how much that matters; like everybloodything else)  who is this man george andrews? his life seems summed up in the one quote shenoy highlights his own understanding with. and what the goodman andrews said, is as staid as what my mama would tell me, while forcing me to eat the bitter gourd. ("the approach, son, the approach")  about everything else, i think this discussion stands clarified:  that we are concerned about (mostly minor) heads losing it, in craving for an easily accessible "high", and thereby glorifying whatever expression or impression they stumble upon.   we do not suggest that intoxication is for amusement. in fact, any definite conviction about the usage of substance is altogether unacceptable.  what we have shredded in this course of substance, is the working of the human mind. (am leaving out discussion, and particular references to jp's disconcern, over why and how the mind can so easily get disillusioned and delusional, for later)  need i really define the implication (or conditional relation) of the "individual"?   that intoxicated minds CAN function (for better, or for worse) is not an opinion for every individual to accept (or even understand).  he who suggests a lobotomy for reasons expressed off-handedly over a blog, so badly needs a thesaurus, with an (experienced) english teacher for guidance.  and here's a quote for anybody who seeks consolation against schizophrenia (nobody panic, please!):   (stated by F. Scott Fitzgerald, who by the way, was an alcoholic)  "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."  waadevuh.

      Shenoy one point - I am not saying people who use drugs cannot use their imagination.  Nor do I deny that Tolkien or Einstein used tobacco, itself the most pervasive narcotic in human society.  I do want to say that it is perfectly possible to reach those heights of inspiration without drugs. So, to identify the creative process with substance use is wrong. Those indiviudals would have found some way to express it anyhway, because it was in them. To give too much credit to the drug is the same as claiming that it was Judas Priest's music that drove those teenagers to kill themselves. Fair enough?  Also, I continue to believe (fine, BELIEVE) that if you consistently turn to something that aritificially alters your mind, you are either nor very happy with the overall state of your mind, or not really in touch with it. Think about people we both know who habitually get drunk or stoned. I think it fits. Do you?  Also, drugs are just not the only or best tool to expand your mind. Here I am in direct contradiction with Shenoy.   I will continue to insist that we can do this ourselves even with the time and so on available to us in this shoddy world we have built. I can - I do - so can you.  Finally, if any of us are going to use any of these things, let's do two things - always bear in mind WHY - whether it is just for relaxation/enjoyment or to explore a mental space. And the second thing is, first EDUCATE yourself. Learn what this substance can do - don't just visit Deoxy or Erowid or all the pro-narc sites, checkout the opposing views as well, get that balance and then decide. This of course is aimed partly at us and partly at people who are only just getting into these things.

      drugs and zark. hmmm…looks like they're the current flavour of the week. who do i choose? don't know zark, so i think i’ll do drugs. interesting debate going on. i will jump right in i say! poking my nose in where it don't belong. with my limited knowledge of the english vocabulary and limited skills of sentence construction, i shall try my best to give you my take on the whole issue. that it shall be incoherent, rambling and dis-jointed is to be taken for granted (you’ve been warned).   so guys - jp, joydeep, and pierre (whoever you are, wherever you are hi!) Do not take anything personally. here goes…  "whether drugs lead to illumination or degradation depends on the spirit in which one takes them." george andrews  **i believe that a person drinks or does a drug excessively only if he or she greatly prefers that altered mental state to normal sentience. put simply, excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself.**  wasn’t it this statement that started the whole thing? well, as far as the author (of the above statement) is concerned the operative word is EXCESSIVE. i don’t completely agree, the operative words are also I BELIEVE. plain and simple. and i don’t agree also with the definition that is being provided for ‘excessive tripping’. if i’m not happy with what’s inside my head, i’ll blow the brains out of it. not go around excessively tripping. yes, doing drugs is the ultimate shortcut to escape from reality, but it’s not the only thing to do. the mind has other avenues.  which brings us to the question: WHAT IS THE MIND? is it the same as the brain? i don’t think so. the brain needs an adequate supply of fresh blood everyday, every minute to keep it going. the mind? well…it needs fresh thoughts, fresh ideas to grow. i needs new and unexplored horizons to conquer. the (active) mind constantly seeks new ways of seeing things. and it is here that DRUGS DO HELP.  yes, the delirium, the ‘high’ brought on by drugs are not what we experience in our everyday humdrum life. not even rock climbing (which i’ve done) can do that. drugs help one get in touch with perspectives that are not his, but, are his. it opens up new avenues of thought and creativity. YES, THIS IS A SHORTCUT. but, there’s too much to do, too little time. so i enjoy a shortcut once in a while. people, sages, have spent a lifetime figuring out what their mind is capable of, while doing nothing else. and since i don’t have that kind of a time to do nothing but explore my mind, a shortcut is welcome. but while i say that, LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR -- the shortcut must be resorted to not as an end by itself, but as a means to something that’s bigger than the drug itself. drugs are not “damaging to the pursuit of human freedom”. excluding an avenue that can take your mind further is. surrendering your life to the drug is. LACK OF FREEDOM is not when you take the drug. it is when the drug takes you.  here’s where i offer my definition of ‘EXCESSIVE TRIPPING’: it is what happens when people take to drugs not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself. the drug is all. everything else is just incidental. what it can do (mentally) is not even considered. the drug just feeds the physical part of a man. the very act of injecting a drug into yourself, taking a drag off the phat joint, becomes the focal point. that is excessive tripping. it is a sign of PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE on the drug, not of things being fucked in the head.   so you see what my whole argument hinges on: IF THE DRUG IS THE MEANS, it’s fine. IF IT’S AN END, then you’ve got a problem on your hands brother. USE THE DRUG, DON’T ABUSE IT. harness its awesome power. do not waste it on mere physical satisfaction. know your mind enough (and this is something only you can do for yourself) and then take it another step forward. know how much is good enough for you, and go ahead.   one more thing, you mentioned “appropriate emotional or psychological dues”. pray, tell me what are those? isn’t living and experiencing life and reading in today’s hyper-everything world not enough? or are the higher states of mind something like the HALLOWED HALLS OF OXFORD, to attain which, you have to go though the necessary tests and pay the appropriate fees?  so what i’m saying is that drugs are fine. but to whom does this apply to? to what extent can one go in the use of drugs? at this point, i enlist the help of the EXPERIENCED SILLY ASS, mr. timothy leary who says: “…is not for every brain....only the healthy, happy, wholesome, handsome, hopeful, humorous, high-velocity should seek these experiences. THIS ELITISM IS TOTALLY SELF-DETERMINED. unless you are self-confident, self-directed, self-selected, please abstain.  my advice to people today is as follows: if you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, if you take the energy process seriously, you must TURN ON, TUNE IN, AND DROP OUT."  GET THE PICTURE? the controlled use of an addictive substance is something that very few people can handle. but most people cannot (whether you can, go find out for yourself). by the way, the controlled use of a drug once a week is not really controlled. it is a low level addiction.  this is the point at which i take exception to joydeep’s statement -- “of course, the individual mind will be far more stable, and reliable without the intoxicated influence. but who's talking about stable minds here?” well, for one, jp was when he said “you can alter your mind without all the junk, if you actually have a mind.” and if what you’re implying that drugs and altered states of mind are the refuge only of unstable minds, i take it that you’re TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. because as much an exception I took to jp’s categorical statement of excessive tripping, I take it too to your statement. You see, as mr. Leary has pointed out, the last thing you need when you’re doing drugs is an unstable mind. If you think that only an unstable mind needs drugs, you’re wrong. What a person with an unstable mind needs is a mental asylum. and if the one with an unstable mind needs an altered state of mind, i recommend a lobotomy. You also used the term “INDIVIDUAL MIND”. hmm…show me a man with multiple mind(s), joydeep, and I’ll show you a schizophrenic, who also probably needs a lobotomy.  so the focus shifts to, as jp pointed out, the quality of the mind. all i will say about it is that people with weak, impressionable minds should not do drugs. how do we define weak impressionable minds? here are a couple of examples. if you read harry potter and then go on to boil a cauldron full of lizard legs and moolangi leaves, while doing a google search for HOGWARTS’ PROSPECTUS, it’s a sure indication that you have a very impressionable young mind. another category of weak, impressionable minds is one where people play silly video games (which were meant for meaningless entertainment anyway), and once they’re done playing, seek out their bazookas and aim to kill other humans, AL-QAEDA ISHTYLE. these 2 are representative examples only, intended to indicate the kind of people who should not do drugs.  why do we read? why do we listen to new music? why do we try to visit new places? try to meet new people? FOR THE MIND? right. and drugs just fits neatly into this list. ah yes, you’ll say drugs are dangerous. but who’s to define dangerous? you mean i’ll die earlier? ok. what is there to live for? reading can be dangerous too. if you love books to much, you’ll go broke buying them (knowledge is not for the masses), leaving you no money to buy a good lunch (and dinner). so which do you think is more dangerous? which just illustrates my point that use of drugs per se is not bad, but abuse is.  coming to the examples of exemplary achievers and achievements quoted: TOLKIEN AND EINSTEIN. following from jp’s thought that he “don't buy all that stuff about defining whether I mean alcohol/natural substances/hard drugs”, I would say that both of them were substance abusers. so what if the substance was tobacco? tobacco relaxes, doesn’t it? just because it’s legal does not mean it does not have hallucinogenic properties. what say jp? so shall i make the categorical statement that humanity owes its existence and progress to drugs? and SYD BARRET. what can i say about him? if it meant that by doing drugs i could do even half of what he did. i would gladly do more drugs. but you see drugs by themselves do not guarantee anything. you need to be of some substance first, to be able to harness it. or you’ll just end up a slave to it, just syd barret himself did. he should’ve dropped out when he was ahead.  THINK ABOUT IT. jp, if there was no use of drugs, there would be no naked lunch, no lucy in the sky with diamonds, and maybe, not even the light bulb. following your logic that every drug user is not using his innate power of mind exploration leads us to say that burroughs, lennon and edison were UNIMAGINATIVE. Or would you rather have us think that people such as FRANK ZAPPA, SHAKESPEARE, DALI, DOYLE, LEWIS CARROL, DICKENS, HENDRIX, JANIS JOPLIN, LAYNE STALEY, POE, AND CARL SAGAN as INSIPID FOOLS just because they used drugs? and who would have been anything but creative had it not been for the drugs? do you still stand by your statement and call these people LOSERS? and you, joydeep, would you have us call people like MARCUS AURELIUS, JULES VERNE, SHELLEY, COLERIDGE, STEVENSON, ALDOUS HUXLEY, FREUD, COLE PORTER, BOB DYLAN, STEVE JOBS AND JP as PEOPLE WITH UNSTABLE MINDS? just because they used drugs? think about it.   you see, drugs can only show you the way to HEAVEN (OR HELL). getting there will have to be on your own two legs. if you don’t trust your lazy legs and your mind to survive the journey, or even make it in the first place, what the hell do you need a map for?

      Deep Joy  Yes, we should discuss this in person. Should be fun!  But this statement: "excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself.", that you take so much exception to, is a simple fact proven by motivational research.   And the operative word is EXCESSIVE.  Okay?   And yes, I do believe that the whole narcotic experience is, in the larger perspective, a dead-end for human evolution. Although it can make for some amusing diversion along the way (as you know I DO believe!). I think that's the real point on which we differ. Right?

       urlLink Psychohistorical Crisis - Donald Kingsbury     Well I've just finished reading this truly epic work of mind-blowing science fiction.  It's cerebral, idea-driven SF at it's purest, and a worthy (if somewhat left-handed) tribute to Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels. Basically, Kingsbury takes the whole notion of a benign group of prophets watching over humanity and utterly deconstructs it.   In the process, he covers a lot of ground - conceptually (the evolution of measures, the nature of personality, the meaning of history...), geographically (from Old Rith - Earth - to galaxies far beyond) and more. There are sly little references to Lost In Space, Asimov's own Daneel Olivaw, those Laws of Robotics, William Shakespeare, Gibbon's Decline and Fall (which also influenced the Foundation series) and much more tucked away here and there.  There are some very colourful, interesting characters - Hyperlord Kikaju Jama, the dilletante revolutionary, the beautiful, light-hearted but searingly intelligent Otara of the Calmer Sea, and so on.   The writing style itself pays homage to Asimov's own broad, sweeping voice, but has a more artistic texture to it. In particular, Kingsbury has a way with the sex bits that's totally non-gratuitous but satisfying at the same time. What  I mean is, without going out of his way to inject such scenes, he nevertheless tackles them well when they fit the flow, and with a minimum of detail manages to evoke an emotional atmosphere that rings true to me, at least.   But what this book is really about is ideas...and so very many of them! To do full justice to this amazing book, I'd have to go into far more detail than I have time for right now. Suffice it to say that, if all books of this length (727 pages) and detail (three lengthy appendices) were as good as this one, Robert Jordan would be a god.

      jaypee,  it's a pity you need to be so vehement over the idea of free 'unadulterated' thought ..  and to hardline how The Great Mind Must Think is ridiculous.  it's probably just your (seemingly newfound) idealism that amuses me ..  although, that your conviction (and dictates) spread far beyond this blog is my hope too.  so, i had to find my way home last evening, and realise the irresponsibility behind my previous comments ..  (i did however check to ensure they were all suppositions, and not definitions, as you have chosen to proclaim) ..   so i state this, for the sake of generations that i cannot speak for, but only attempt speaking to: "don't ever get intoxicated - be it with weed, alcohol, anything else. the struggle - through the flood of thought, over utmost relaxation, and into focussed deliberations - can be intensely gratifying, or gravely allusive. you might as well struggle with reality first hand."  now, i need to find the root of this discussion, that we have rambled over and on for so long.   my disconcern has firmly been over your opinion that: "excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself."  to me, this sounds more of a disconcerted statement of an individual mind.   that you think the problem is "the quality of the mind" is what i choose to laugh (aloud) at.  where do you find a problem?  if you think the mind is imperfect, i say the mind is always striving for perfection .. and that is why it is never perfect, but in the life-long process of attaining perfection. (this is relative to the individual, mind you)  (and the only minds in a state of complete perfection are resting in graves)  i have agreed about all your ideas concerning The Mind. It IS ALL in The Mind. (no second thoughts necessary)  so why then do people get high? more likely a question (directed to what you have admitted): how does smoking a spiff relax you?  what is it about this relaxation? if the mind is "relaxed", how much better can it get??  (ps: this last bit after reading your last blog-in: the junky is most disconcerted, blasting off without reason, and the reason therein is with the individual mind. i have come through harsh experiences of wasted close-ones hell-bent on losing it, without even an attempt at rationalised behaviour .. and you can be sure i feel very deeply about this too; but while junkies (the lost ones) find their way around, (causing us mere mortals to get all-so didactic), can't we get down to what the damn junk really does to our minds? pps: umm, claim what you want .. but i believe a discussion in person - over a smoke - will work out much better, for two minds trying hard to reason things out.  - deep joy

      By the way, Deep Joy, all this vehemence and ass-kicking isn't intended as a personally motivated bludgeoning. I really do feel very deeply about this matter - and I don't meant to be self-righteous.   But when you've spent a week looking after a junky who'se cold-turkeying, it kind of rearranges your perspectives on the whole narcotic question.  See, what I'm really concerned about is FREEDOM. And you can expect me to consistently strike out at anything that I percieve as being damaging to the pursuit of human freedom.   Sorry if I step on a few toes in the process. Take it in the spirit it's intended. (I'm sure you are!)

      I quote: 'if open spaces aren't accessible, substance is. '  BULLSHIT.  By the same logic, 'if willing women aren't available, whores are'.  I quote again: 'the problem as i understand here is bad shit.'  The problem is not the quality of the SHIT. It's the quality of the MIND.  You want to explore? Remember something called imagination? Unaided human flight of fancy? No? LOSER.  Tolkien never needed 'purest contry produce' to imagine a Middle Earth so real it has become almost a second home to so many.  Einstein didn't need a 'phat joint' to put together a theory that challenged the whole edifice of classical physics, and changed the way scientists look at reality.   You could point-counterpoint with people who did achieve things under the influence. All those instances are rendered irrelevant by the fact that similar achievements can and have been made without the use of substances. The key here is the human mind -that mass of grey tissue floating around in the confines of your cranium.  You can achieve wonders with it if you're willing to spare the time and effort.   And substances are by no means the only or even best way to induce different modes of thought.  Computer games, as Pierre pointed out, can jumpstart your head into a new level. Meditation. The creative process itelf. Sex, for Zark's sake.  By imagining you can only stretch mentally when you smoke, drink, shoot or whatever, you are limiting your own inbridled exploration of your innate potential.   Maybe you should do yourself a favour and try exploring your own thoughts and ideas without those crutches you seem to want to cling to and justify so fondly.  Explore that...

       Exploring It   completely accept that it's all in the mind. that i need not indulge in substance is accepted too. but that doesn't explain what substance does to the mind, does it?  of course, the individual mind will be far more stable, and reliable without the intoxicated influence. but who's talking about stable minds here?   relaxation can very much become an artificially induced state as well. and if open spaces aren't accessible, substance is.  so my sober mind acts without unnecessary thought.  and mebbe, the extra worrying does so much good .. by reminding me at every moment that this could be so much better ..  ah! but that's an individual mind again.  in the state of a 'high' that i attempted describing, the individual mind (provided it is aware and conscious) is a lot more open to stimulation, allowing more of a 'feel' than is possible in a sober state. (this steps into psychic modes, it does)  (and, also a whollota incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo, all words after all; whathefuck does dude mean by feel, yes?)  ps: never read syd, never heard of castaneda; all i speak is what i have made out (vaguely). pps: the problem as i understand here is bad shit. people need the purest country produce. i've got a lot of that.

      Dude, Joydeep, you make too big a deal about altered states of mind. You can alter your mind without all the junk, if you actually have a mind. Believe me. Get in touch with your head WITHOUT that stuff. Then you wouldn't need the crutch of a phat joint to express yourself...  And frankly, I don't buy all that stuff about defining whether I mean alcohol/natural substances/hard drugs. It's all an artificially induced state, one that you haven't paid the appropriate emotional or psychological dues to achieve, and you will eventually suffer the consequences of taking the easy way out.   I enjoy the occasional spliff myself. Yes, it relaxes me. Sometimes, it helps me focus on a creative problem a little better, because the background white noise is cut out.   But you know what? I can achieve all that without inputting anything. I'm not bragging, it's true. And so can you.  I don't buy all this phoney Carlos Castaneda style baloney, and I'm chagrined at how deeply ingrained it is in people of my generation, despite evidence to the contrary, and despite alternative means of achieving the same states.  Have we learned nothing from the likes of Syd Barrett?  Substances that alter your mental state (weeds, seeds, pills, wahtever) are a dangerous shortcut, if what you're looking for is mental growth. If it's just to relax once in a while, that's ok. But don't look to a substance to give you what your mind is already capable of.  Or are you so steeped in our quick-fix consumerist culture that you don't want to evolve and explore the mind on your own?

      This today: India today decided not to send troops to Iraq, saying it would have considered such a request only if it came from the United Nations.   "If there was an explicit UN mandate for the purpose, the Government of India could consider the deployment of our troops in Iraq," External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters after a 90-minute meeting of Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) which discussed the issue.  Considering that the UN is pretty much US's butt-boy, I don't see this as anything but a grandstanding time-wasting tactic. Basically, the governemnt is just spinning its wheels, torn between wanting so bad to kiss up to the US and being very aware that the people may not like it, and Assembly Elections are around the corner...

      One of the rather odder aspects of my job involves creating a weekly poll for the intranet of one of our clients. Just that: a weekly poll. No inputs on what it should be about, what to avoid or anything. Thou shalt make us a weekly poll. So far, I've given them polls on test cricket, the movies and so on. One of the burning issues in our country right now is the whole sordid Ayodhya mess. So I sent them a poll related to that today. They rejected it, without giving a reason and I receive an imperial verdict to make a new one. That's why this country is going to hell on the express lane - we don't want to think about the real issues that face us. Just gas off about cricket and movies and who knows what else, as long as it's not really important. When we ARE forced to face up, as anyone who has watched the NDTV program We he People can tell you, we just fall into meaningless platitudes, inflammatory polemic and, rapidly, utter incoherence.  Cowards.

       "tripped out", being   dearest lord of the vaguest ramblings, your discourses and tidbits work like mouthfreshener for me. by saying that, i do not mean i really follow every meaning you describe, but your words are comfortingly fresh. i dig that, like "that's the shit" only an inflected tone can convey.  for this piece of mine, i choose words to respond to one statement in particular, that you chose to highlight as your understanding, in the piece titled "shaking off the chains".  i cannot speak for musicians, as i have only ever appreciated the kind, and never been one among them. but to pursue a creative art of self-expression, is something i understand as universal.  all that apart, this bleary-eyed monday-morning head was most piqued to read a remark, such: "I believe that a person drinks or does a drug excessively only if he or she greatly prefers that altered mental state to normal sentience. Put simply, excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself ."  it seems to me, that the state of being 'tripped out' has been left unsatisfactorily described. of course, before getting to the state itself, there are several issues that need clarification: for one, the issue of "excessive" indulgence. in what context is this "excess"? and who is to determine how much is "excessive" for every and any one?  i have known, and in fact been (over earlier days) in, the out-of-conscious state with drug/alcohol amounts that are by no standards much; on the contrary, the least amounts could get certain minds way out of control.  agreeably, "excessive" indulgence implying regular consumption, does decrease the relative effect on a mind over time, causing an increase in need (or craving) - for the sake of attaining a state off-handedly identified as a "higher" state.  the point i disagree with is that a mind needs to be necessarily discontent with the self in order to indulge excessively in intoxication. if the 'altered state-of-mind' can be identified (as a bio-logical reaction), and the effects therein comprehended clearly, this state-of-mind can, i believe, serve to work wonders. (to define such a state can seem and sound really hollow and pointless, as, who is to explain how what-i-mean really feels like?)  but i must attempt defining this 'altered state'. in my opinion, the feeling most commonly understood as a drug/alcohol-induced 'high', is nothing but a 'higher state of consciousness' (as a bio-logical effect of a sedated nervous system, and increased "sensitivity" of the individual mind).  most minds introduced to this state of increased sensitivity get driven into spiralling private pre-occupations of the self. such pre-occupations can last over life-long experiences, and really depend on vaguely defined (and oft misunderstood) references to functioning modes of the individual mind: issues like the sense of self-criticism, logical reasoning, mental balance, etc..  if the mind experiences such a state in an open environment (physically, this could mean open skies and nature, or even in the act of love-making), the mind might be able to broaden its understanding - over partners, known people, other people, people in general, and probably even the world.  in such a state, when the sensitivity of a mind is at its peak, expression turns out in the purest form known to it.  what struck me most in your message that accepts musicians getting 'tripped out' before making music, is the apparent cluelessness regarding the cause and effect of intoxication. (now, alcohol versus natural substances versus hardcore drugs is a discussion apart altogether)  the bottomline IS a state of mind. this can be described by most people as simply "getting high", explained by few others as an "elevated" state of being, and most commonly misunderstood as 'smashed', etc .. if the mind loses all control.  having scripted this piece, i find so many unclear statements, and vaguer allusions, herein, that i now so dearly wish i'd written this after smoking a big phat joint.

      This is it. The heavy metal fans of today are anal, obsessive, nerdy GEEKS.   There was a time when it was all metal, basically. There was thrash and there was classic. Then came this thing called 'death' which you either got, or didn't. Now?  I just visited an Indian site devoted to metal, and here are some of the genres I actually saw mentioned in all seriousness:    Symphonic Black/Death  (violins and violence, I guess)   South Florida black metal  (not to be confused with Miami Vice)   Ancient Black metal  (the sort of thing Lara Croft digs up, I suppose)   dark and brutal death metal  (as opposed to the light and gentle kind)   hardcore metal  (aha. This is the REAL metal...right?)   Brutal Grind/Death metal  (What do they do? Brutalise you in such a way as to both grind you and make you die?)   hardcore punk metal  (Aha. Obviously not Green Day, that much is clear)   doom metal  (I think it's doomed anyhow)   avantgarde black metal  (if it ain't Celtic Frost, I don't think so)   Hindu-Scriptures-Influenced-Death-Metal-Band  (Om Nama Yama?)   old school Death Metal  (The old death metal I used to hear when I was in school)   Grind  (aha. A whole metal genre named after an MTV dance program. Odd)   ultra brutal Death Metal  (ahhhh...this must be the REAL hard stuff...right?)  eurhhh....go get a life, wankers. Or better yet, end your own.

      I moved back into my bachelor pad on saturday. I had to leave it for a while in between, when I was doing the freelance thing, because that gig doesn't pay well enough or regulalrly enough to run your own house.  I share the place with Tushar, a software chap who also plays the drums. We have a whole lot of friends in common, virtually our whole social circle is the same, or used to be.   Last night, I realised how very singular I have become. Tush and three other common friends were in the hall, smoking up, watching a movie and later listening to Liquid Tension Experiment, a side-project of prog-wank heroes, Dream Theater.  In the meantime, I was in my room listening to Blur and Nick Cave and reading Vance Packard.  It was like two different worlds under one roof. A bright, brash world I used to think I belonged in, and this quiet, but fascinating world I am now building for myself. The spaces are growing around me. I talk to the wind...

      I was thinking about how people pick a role and then use it to limit rather than explore themselves. I was thinking about this because I play (or at least used to play) the bass guitar, and a lot of the people I know are musicians.  You'd think someone who is pursuing a creative art of self-expression would be an interesting, fulfilled person with a lot to share socially. Well, it really isn't so. Most of the musicians I know are rather boring people outside of that small circle of musicians and their followers. An alarming number of them drink, smoke pot or experiment with other stuff to the extent that it dominates their social lives, destroying it in some cases.  I believe that a person drinks or does a drug excessively only if he or she greatly prefers that altered mental state to normal sentience. Put simply, excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself. In many ways, these people have so identified themselves with their role as musicians that they are hardly capable of being anything else, of embodying all those little details and nuances that make up a complete human being.  Sure they crack a lot of jokes, but after sometime that becomes a crutch as well. These in-jokes and phrases pop up and replace any kind of meaningful conversation that might reveal how little they have to say.  And even the spread of these little memes shows how insulated and self-referential the music community here has made itself. I remember, earlier this year, I was helping a friend of mine, a fellow bassist, with his copy test for an ad agency. Whenever he came out with ideas that rang true, I would encourage him by saying 'that's the shit!'. A few weeks later, I had this phrase used at me by a musician who had just come down from Bombay, with exactly the same tone and inflection in which I'd used it. Very touching, but, hell, can't you think up your own catchphrases for Zark's sake? I think most of the musicians I know have somehow stunted their emotional growth at the adolescent level - probably because that's the stage at which they felt the most joy in their music, and therefore, their lives.  I notice that these people find it very hard to transit into a wholesome, mature state of mind and life. They cling to all the wrong aspects of being a musician - the license, the waywardness, the mindless rebelliousness, pointless technical excellence and reject the chance to take it all to the next level.  In a way, my friend who described them as just 'meeting down the pub to blow sunshine up each other's asses' might have been at least half-right. I realise that I took exception to what he said partly because I still have some remnants of loyalty to that community, and partly because the particular band he was picking on, Cryptic, is far too good to just dismiss like that.  This is just one instance of the thought I'd introduced at the beginning. There are so many other ways in which people use an aspect of their lives to actually limit themselves rather than run with it and seize freedom in a larger sense. Why are people so afraid of freedom? What do you think?

      I'm in Madras after a gap of nearly three years. Thelast time I was here, I was part of a band that was participating in IIT Madras' annual cultural festival. Now I'm here on a business trip. Funny how life is.  The place is pretty much as I remember it. Fresh from Bangalore, it all seems rather smelly, incredibly mosquito-ridden and the weather is as humid as ever. What really sets a Madras (I refuse to refer to it as Chennai, by the way. I was born in a place called Madras and that's the story I'm sticking to) street apart from it's Bangalore counterpart is the amount of organic waste rotting everywhere. The usual excretions, plus flowers, leaves and various other odds and ends that somehow just don't form a major portion of the litter in colder, harder Bangalore. I might be wrong, but another difference is a certain vibrance. The vibe on the streets is somehow warm, vivacious and very earthy. In contrast, Bangalore is chaotic, sullen, scheming and crude for the most part. It's probably because of the influx of rich IT types, and the displacement as well as the new opportunties for - well - opportunism - felt by the locals as a consequence. In a way, Bangalore is starting to feel a bit like a tourist trap - a situation where a large percentage of the population is permanently geared up to exploit another large section, whether transient or just new. Not that the IT types are innocents abroad - in many ways, it's their crude, materialistic attitudes that have brought about this change in Bangalore. I can't really comment all that much on Madras on the basis of a day spenthere - but the contrasts have, oddly enough, helped me crystallise a lot of the things I've been percieving about Bangalore. I haven't been able to locate the second-hand book stores yet, but one glance at my grandfather's collection - THOUSANDS of books, I tell you, reminded me that, in Madras at least, I hardly need them.  It's also been fun meeting my little cousins. I never imagined Iwould enjoy being with two little kids as much as I am, but I will confess I'm glad it's time for them to sleep. they can get pretty exhausting - where does all that energy come from anyway?

      It's past 6 in the gathering evening. Thick clouds outside make it hard to tell if the sun is still setting or not. after a long day of slow disasters, quick saves and all-round wage slaving, the office is slowing down, gradually easing up to a complete halt. Some of my colleagues are perched in front of their terminals, eyes focussed, supple fingers poised and twitching, catching a few rounds of a virtual bike race, or shooting up Nazis somewhere near Normandy Beach. Others are gathered in the balcony exchanging conversation and puffs off their cigarettes. Outside, the city goes whizzing by, as it always does. Another work day is done. Oh wait. A sudden strident phone rings. Please let it be over...ahhh false alarm. The day ends, all but an hour of hot beverages, reading and maybe conversation down at India Coffee House.

      I've been thinking about the use of cliches. 'Don't' is a good admonition in this regard, as far as it goes, but cliches are a lot more interesting than such an attitude would suggest.  Why do cliches happen? Because they work. Because they reflect the half-dozen or so common hopes, fears or aspirations we all carry around inside our heads. Because they connect.   Folk tales thrive on cliches - the wicked step mother, the changling child, the innocent abroad, the big bad wolf and so on. They work because they use these cliches to tell stories that resonate with something very deep in the psyche of their audience.  In this sense, cliches can be taken as 'signs' which have a universally accepted significance. Which is what words also are, after all. By manipulating these signs, the creator can do away with a lot of scene-setting and get on with the narrative, the story, the message.   There are art forms like Japanese  urlLink  Noh     urlLink  Theatre  which consist entirely of spinning around a set of given cliches. The thrill is in seeing what new form the old chestnuts will take this time. Superhero comics and much of the fantasy genre work on the same premise.   But cliches are so often the first and last refuge of the incompetent - this is most clearly visible in the world of cinema and television.  Where does the crossing-over point occur, the divide between an intelligent, interesting manipulation of archetypes and the mindless re-bottling of old stale wine?   *Sadly, this has nothing to do with   urlLink  Karen Cliche... damn.

      A rather interesting essay. Although the argument basically just seems to boil down to : 'Some people NEED drugs just to cope in this fucked up world.' Going by the same logic, 'some people NEED to rape babies just to cope in this fucked up world.' OK, that wasn't quite fair, I realise. Anyway go read the essay and decide for yourself.   In fairness, I should add that the writer is making a valid point when he says that pro-sobriety types who feel you shouldn't use a narcotic to help you cope wouldn't back their statement by offering such people constructive help. We should find a way to make help more accesible before condemning peope who use some mind-altering substance (alcohol, weed, whatever)  to deal with their problems.   I guess the key is in a statement by Allan Watts, where he says in his essay 'Psychedelics and Religious Experience',  'their (psychedelics, but I'm extending it to psychotropics in general) free and responsible use be exempt from legal restraint'.   The point is defining what exactly responsible use means. Because very few (maybe only 2) of the pro-drug people I know are actually using their trips in a manner that could be described as 'responsible'.   And once you come to an acceptable definition of 'responsible use', how do you enforce it?   Any ideas on either the definition or enforcement of 'responsible use'? Because I do accept that making substances illegal just because a large number of people may misuse them is contrary to the freedom of the individual. But the alternative cannot be a free-for-all state of licence.   A good definition of 'responsible use' has to allow for both recreational use and transformational use. Just narrowing it down either way isn't an answer either.   And the REAL problem is enforcement...damn. Why does it all have to be so complex? Because this is the real world, I guess.   Actually it isn't an issue of enforcement so much as an issue of giving people access to sensible, balanced information and advice.  Sadly, the whole issue just polarises people so much (myself very much included) that such an ideal state of affairs is aeons away.

      People are strange. Deeply, deeply strange.  I chanced upon a site called 'Gorean Whsipers' recently, after picking up a few Gor books by John Norman. These books feature a society where most women are slave-girls. Apparently, a lot of people of 'parallel sexual orientations' look to these books as a sort of scripture or guide.   This particular site is run by a BDSM community who pattern their lifestyles after the Gor books. I don't know if it's all for real, but I find it deeply disturbing to come across women in this day and age making statements like 'And truly I am - his - for as long as he permits me to love and serve at his feet., or 'The feeling of surrender is peaceful...It's being content .. unquestioning .. always feeling safe .. it's being joyful that you're a slave and grateful for the opportunity...it's the ability to be absolutely trusting of your Master .. it's believing in him even when he makes mistakes. '  erkks? If this is for real, I do indeed find it DEEPLY disturbing. I respect everyone's right to choose their own lifestyle, but...I just don't get this at all.

      erhhh...today I was down with a sudden stomach upset. Very shitty day.  On the bright side, I picked up the issue of That Glossy Mag which included my anti-dj article, 'Whatever Happened To Humanity?'   I realise I disagree now with some of the points I made in that article. Specifically, I'd contended that electronic music technology makes it easier for people with no actual traditional music skills to create something approximating music. Actually, that's true, but it doesn't mean that this technology is any less valid than good old musical instruments. A true artist will make use of any tool at hand to create.   I guess the point I should have made is that it's easy to get carried away with the dj thing because it's now and it's fresh, but even so, the same standards that apply to any other kind of music must be used in assessing this music as well.   When it comes to that, there are as few really important or interesting things happening in the dj scene as there are in rock. Still, rock has been around fora while, and declared dead with unfailing regularity. It's also done the resurrection thing with the same regularity, so it's important not to treat rock music as a closed book - there are exciting sounds kicking around the edges, and a phoenix act may well be on its way.   At least, I hope so...

      I seem to be getting a little fixed about my opinions. I have very definite stances on various things and I'm no longer interested in debating the other side. What I tend to feel is, either see what I'm trying to say, or get lost. This doesn't apply to every single area - and it doesn't apply to everyone I know. But it does seem to be my overriding attitude in most dealings. Then again, that's usually in interaction with people who are a bit younger than me, now that I come to think of it. I often feel impatient with what they have to say because I feel they aren't saying or feeling anything new or interesting. Nearly all the time, they really aren't - when I ask for specifics, they just clam up and accuse me of being heavy-handed or narrow minded and then they exit the discussion.   Is it a growing up thing or just a growing older thing?

      Here's a little scrap from a story I'm working on. Comments and criticism are welcome...  Let's try this: a vast room, somewhere deep in the caverns of a city (hollowed out of the earth's crust in a bid to solve ever-growing housing problems some three centuries previously). Various odds and ends of esoteric equipment litter the room in a vaguely ordered chaos. The centerpiece of the whole space is a vast haze, black with lightning-flashes of blue at the center and ringed with a hazy, blinding white at the edges. It forms a rough circle. Arcs of blue flare out from the core now and then, lancing across the room without any visible effect.   Now, the players. A group of 19 young research scientists from various parts of the solar system. Some patched in, some physically present. Some of the patch-ins are interfaced with a Bodysuit to join the physically present in manipulating a complex of wires, circuits and other gadgetry that frames the circular manifestation. They are headed by an older man, grey haired but with a youthful vigour and a charismatic air, a bit like a MedicSoap Older Doctor. Nevertheless, he is a brilliant man.  Suddenly, the yawning black turns an alarming shade of red. Various sirens go off, lights flash and researchers run around yodelling in confusion, trying to follow panic-forgotten emergency protocols. With a shout, the older man rallies them around and puts them to work on the framework device.  ‘Shut it down, that's our only hope.’ He calls out, directing individual researchers to different tasks at different nodes of the structure. The junior scientists, physically present, patched in and prosthetically manifest, go about their tasks with frantic efficiency. The red glow seems to stretch out of the haze, bulging out of the confines of the framework, gradually at first. As time passes, one scientist after the other fails to achieve the desired result and moves on to another task. Gradually, more than half of the team find themselves out of useful options and mill around their as-yet active comrades, hoping to find some reassurance.   The glow has reached its point of maximum contraction now, and coalesces into a filmy skin, stretched tight over a blinding glow. The leader calls his helpers away from their tasks and gathers them around him. They huddle together, many embracing, some weeping, staring all the while at the object before them.  The glow increases in intensity. A sudden humming sound reaches a crescendo and the membrane explodes, spewing light and energy in its blast.

      Yesterday I read two   urlLink Frank Miller   comics, Ronin and Hard Boiled.   Very interesting stuff. Both of them would work perfectly well as prose stories - there's more than enough content there. Seeing that level of concept told in the form of a comic, reminded me of this comic edition of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus that I have, illustrated by  urlLink Oscar Zarate.   I think the story came alive for me in the pages of that comic far more than they ever could have years later when I studied the play in college. There were just so many nuances and resonances of the story that my lecturer just wasn't capable of pointing out.  A comic project is going to be a real opportunity to focus and crystallise my storytelling abilities. Hopefully, that will also translate back into greater depth in my prose writing - the experience should help me balance out my tendancy to a very expository, idea-based style (the Asimov/Clarke/Herbert thing) with a more hard-boiled, immediate element.   One of the things I really admire in  urlLink Ken MacLeod's     novels is the visual eye-kick he often delivers. A lot of very good writers, especially in sf, haven't succesfully balanced out a vividness of setting and action with a depth of ideas - so this is definitely something worth exploring.

      I guess the quest for knowledge thing I mentioned earlier is basically an expression of the search for growth. Knowledge is one way to grow. There are others, as well.

      Well, I stopped smoking yesterday (Aug 1) according to plan. I chickened a bit and took a couple of drags of a cigarette before going in for my ah - morning amenities, but then I chucked it away. Chewing Wrigley's Doublemint and drinking lots of water to keep the craving and the crankiness at bay. It mostly is working, except I yelled at an auto driver for about 5 minutes, but then those suckers deserve most of the cussing they get. Sharing a bong with a friend in the night helped considerably - it showed me how much better the green leaf is than the brown one, in every way, and buffered my resolve to chuck this habit.  Oddly, I'm not getting constipated, like a lot of people predicted. Or maybe it takes time to kick in. Okay, that's more than I need to share with all three of you, I'll zip it up for now. Wish me luck as I wade back into the nicotine-less life!

      The important thing is not to confuse the need to learn with the need to believe. Many areas of human knowledge - history, for example, are not absolute pronouncements of fact beyond a certain surface level of detail. A responsible scholar refrains from presenting absolutes where there only certainties and uncertainties of differing magnitudes.   Sadly the number of irresponsible, axe-to-grind proselytisers, reactionaries and apologists putting out their counterfactual persuasions in the name of spreading information gets larger everyday.   It's important to retain the ability to critically assess every supposed 'fact' we are presented with, to examine the validity of each arguement we come across. There may be no absolute truth - but there are certainly a wide array of definite untruths jostling to capitalise on our credulity.   Perhaps the ability to recognise misinformation is even more important than the ability to find information.

      the human yearning for continuing knowledge is a universal phenomenon. individual minds have always felt the need to learn more, and keep learning more and more, about the world we live in.  we constantly feel the need to explain most common incidents, and phenomena, because the lack of an explanation can immediately assume mysterious, and sometimes even scary interpretations. (last dark night in bed, a strange ruffling sound shook me awake; and in pure sniper-manner i froze on the source: first alerted, second hunting, third time finally secured: rotten scrap of loose paper against the wall - which in those two seconds, sounded like an intruder, perhaps a rat, an electric wire burning, cat outside, and so much more.) while the desire to learn must be rooted in the sense of acquiring and broadening understanding, this (understanding) is almost always in direct relation to immediate individual circumstance (directly thereby, influencing individual understanding). through many periods in history, several men dominated with power and force, while a few names would consistently arise in time, to lead the way, in thought, with wisdom, and intelligence. there were many such 'great minds' who were able to understand, and think in global proportions. recent times (as we know it in 2003) even found many who would much rather spend thought on worldly proportions. but commerce never impeded the student's craving for knowledge, and in fact, the latest information age is what they have already called the future. this must mean that we have so much more to learn - so much more than all of them before us did. after all, only we can speak of all that history. it just saddens me to see so many heads working so hard for the sake of money, forsaking ambition, and probably even ability. a few do yet inspire individuals. guess i need to snipe more of them.

      For some reason, I've always had an inordinate fondness for clipped, descriptive passages like this:   'For a heavy man, he gave an unusual impression of being muscular instead of fat, and he was very dapper, wearing a snappy tweed suit which was just a little on the zoot side, but not sufficiently zoot to be ridiculous. It was a good suit, and all the accessories were expensive. He was not much more than thirty, with blue eyes, fine white teeth, a taffy-colored mustache, blond hair. He gave the general impression of a slicker.'    -Kenneth Robeson, The Spook of Grandpa Eben (A Doc Savage Adventure)

      For some reason, writing about music just doesn't appeal to me anymore. It's a bit like cycling without a fish. Whatever that meant. Seriously, though, writing about individual bands, albums or concerts somehow seems too narrow. There isn't really all that very much you can derive from any one band, especially not a popular rock n roll band.   I hate to say it, but the largest perecentage of rock music is pretty inconsequential when you come right down to it, even the stuff I like. Which is actually no big deal - it's just pop culture and doesn't need to go any deeper.   I guess what's really put me off is the fan community who assume and believe it's all so deep and meaningful when it's only rock n' roll for Zark's sake. Get over yourselves, kiddos.   Oh yea, this little outburst was inspired by a conversation with a friend who writes about music for a living.

      i walk haltingly, crutched over armpits digging the ground hard.  the pain is stinging, seething lingering. but the words refuse to dance. the jig is limp.  super-boy with left tibia of steel. my first boss, the hag, proclaimed lofty that i must not be so "pedantic", shuffling away. i could run her down now.  so i did soar, take off, fly clean, and the efforts were not wasted. yes i fell, so many a time leaving big holes behind they swept up, covered the wreck, and kept the laughs ringing. so i can turn around and smile looking at last.  everybody's pointing ways far out,  all rooted in the ground i stand, looking around, for someone who follows whatanall they say.  as for now, i can follow slow, broke a leg, sorry, the rush of things don't leave me flailing, gasping,  like all else that do breathe.  fate, called a friend, not too late, and that night wasn't the first, 'course not, dudhead, and you better get up and about quick.

      Well, my Science Fiction dreams are soon going to face the acid test of reality. I've more or less tinkered one of my favourite stories into a state where I don't want to mess with it anymore. I've picked out a few dozen pro and semi pro SF 'zines to submit it to - one at a time, of course. And once I send it off, I'm going to be holding my breath, waiting for those rejection slips!!!  Seriously, the story is called 'Homecoming'. It's driven by two broad ideas, expressed in the context of a coming-of-age story.  The core ideas are:  An alternate vision of space expansion to the pioneering, exploration and colonisation driven model still used by most SF. I think the driving force will be commerce, not adventure or territorial acquisition. I'm just extrapolating from existing historical facts - the East India Company established a presence in India long before HM the Queen, for instance. I've chosen a particular service industry as the vehicle for this expansion, which I thought was very original, but I've since read a Stanley Weinbaum story that uses the same chaps for the same purpose. Well, my development of the idea is still pretty different. I've tried to explore where people with the real pioneer spirit would go in such a situation, and found a possibly unexpected but very familiar destination for them.  It's also an extended parable about the Great Indian Brain Drain and how I think it can be dealt with in the long run.   Other elements that I explored are something I'd like to call 'imaginary music' (something like Borges' imaginary books) and a look at the interpersonal dynamics in a close-knit family.   I know it sounds like an awful lot, but actually, its just a couple of core ideas with a reasonable number of related and unrelated issues also being explored. Since I can't do blockbuster action, the least I can give my (as yet imaginary) readers is a lot to think about.  Another reason I'm eager to get this story doing the round is that I've got a couple more stories exploring the same overall future-history and the ideas that sparked it off. But it's hard to move on to a new project until you've done something with the old one, even if it's just to definitely know that it was a failure.

      I've been noticing, both online and in what we, increasingly laughably, call the real world, that there are two basic approaches people of 'superior taste' have towards reccomending books, music and so on to others. I've put 'superior taste' in quotes, because this is a subjective designation, but what i'm referring to is, for instance, the fantasy fan who is more into Erikson, Martin or Ford and how she would approach trying to reccomend trying these writers out to someone whos tastes are still more - er - 'inferior'. I'm not making a value judgement here, really, just trying to keep my terms consistent.  Anyway, I've found one approach is to just bombard the hapless victim with 'oh get over that stuff, you should read X Y and Z instead, they are so much broader in vision, literary merit and so and on so forth'. This is basically the crusading approach. It can work if the recepient is farily open-minded or has some reason to trust you.  But if they don't, which is very often the case online, this approach can actually be counter-productive. I've seen too many forums that hive off into a 'mass aesthetic' faction and an 'high-brow connoiseur' faction.   I think everyone looses in a situation like this. 'mass' types totally lock themselves away from some real landmark work because it is for 'those other guys' and the 'high-brows' also suffer by being out of touch with the pulse of the larger generic world, where something good does happen from time to time.   That's why I've found it makes more sense to approach an 'inferior' in a totally different way. If the person you are trying to convert likes Avril Lavigne, Creed and Coldplay, fair enough. These are her tastes and they mean something to her. Rather than alienate her, it makes much more sense to show her how what you like is related to what you like. Instead of saying 'Ugh Coldplay is so wussy, they are cheap Radiohead knock-offs' you could instead say, 'if you like Coldplay so much, you know, Radiohead was a big influence on them. It might take a little effort, but you may find Radiohead worth trying.'   This is simple persuasion procedure. Missionaries, politicians, salesmen and seducers of both sexes have used it over the millennia to good effect. It may seem hard to apply it to a topic you feel passionately about, but maybe that's exactly when gentle persuasion is most useful.   Got that? Good. Now assume the position...

      Remember the Catwoman in that old Batman TV series? Of course you do - Julie Newmar in a tight, black Catsuit. She only appeared in 6 episodes, but well over 30 years later, we're still feeling the heat - Batman, Robin, and all of us clenched-fisted Batfans, even those who, like me, weren't even born when these episodes frist aired. Her prowling, purring, seductive portrayal of a super-villainess who was always destined to occupy center stage in a million wet dreams is still something of a landmark.   The equally lovely Eartha Kitt, her replacement, just didn't have the same smoldering, languorous mix of allure and threat. Michelle Pfeifer came closest, in an otherwise mixed film that most of us don't remember all that much about. Serious actress that she is, Ms. Pfeiffer attempted a deeper analysis of Catwoman : `There are feminist elements in Catwoman, and I do see her as a positive role model if you look at her metaphorically. She's about empowerment - a character coming into her own.'   Be that as it may, what Pfeiffer's portrayal is most significant for, as far as this little essay is concerned, is that Catwoman finally got into leather. It's not too clear exactly what the Catsuit is made of in the comics and the TV Catwomen seem to have been wearing some indeterminate, shiny fabric, but we knew all along, I think, that it had to be leather. And Pfeiffer (or rather Tim Burton) finally gave us leather!   These feline musings were brought on by the observation that nearly every action flick worth its salt these days, particularly if it has an SF or comic-book element, seems to feature at least one leather-clad ass-kicking hottie. Matrix: Reloaded had Carrie Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett Smith and Monica Belluci, X-Men: 2 saw Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Kelly Hu doing the leather routine, Jennifer Garner sports leather in Daredevil and Kristanna Loken's Dominatrix is again decked out in a red leather outfit that she swipes from its rightful owner within the first few minutes of the movie. Chicks in leather are everywhere.   I'm not complaining - far from it, in fact. And that's the whole point. There seems to be something intrinsically arousing about a woman in a tight, shiny leather costume. It's right up there with black lace, schoolgirl uniforms and all the other odd, often undignified styles we like to garb our fantasy women in, before rapidly disrobing them.   I won't even attempt to analyse what the magic of a chick in leather is all about. Frankly, the very thought gets me far too hot and bothered for that sort of rational thought...

      Well, I saw Terminator 3 last night and I quite enjoyed it. I think people just like sequel-bashing because it makes them feel important. They still watch the sequels, though. I've seen some really inane remarks about this movie:  Schwarzenneger has become old. (well, duh) The Terminatrix has no expressions. (like Arnie is all animated) John Connor is a wimp. (as long as Arnie's around, does it matter?) Claire Danes looks like an aunty. (some people just have no sense, I guess)  Strangely, all these dumb remarks were made by ONE person , along with a few others that I shall not deign to even repeat. Some people just aren't happy unless they're bashing something, I guess.  I won't pretend the movie was really significant and so forth, but it was entertaining, and that's all I really expected, and that's certainly what I got.   Expect T4 by the year 2014?

      When will people learn to use language to COMMUNICATE???   I was checking out some work by an interactive design student from a big institute in Italy. Her work is really good, but it all kind of fell apart when I came to the section where she defined her focus: 'Exploring ubiquitous computing systems within public sector scenarios.'  Duh???  Basically, if you are into designing for usability, the same should apply to verbal content as well. Right?

      I'm sad to report that Big Sister's attempts to 'clean up' Madras seem to have resulted in wiping out much of the second hand book business there. All those pavement stalls in Moor Market? They're gone. I heard they've been relocated to some building, but didn't have time to track this rumour down. I did find an old whitebeard with piles of even older text books in Mylapore. When I asked, he managed to pull out some 'novels' (his generic word for any book that is not a text-book) - I managed to get a collection of short stories by Isaac Singer, a book by Kuldip Nair and JK Galbraith's The Affluent Society. Apparently most of his 'novels' were confiscated in a recent raid. But there's hope - he said if I came by next week, he could get me more 'novels'. Of course, I won't be able to do that, but maybe next month...  Next, I headed down to Mount Road where, across and down the road from Higginbothams, I managed to find another second-hand bookstall by the pavement. He had quite a large collection and an impressive selection of fantasy and sf - I picked up books by Robert Heinlein, Jack Vance, Larry Niven, Anne McCaffrey and LE Modessit Jr. Also a few other odds and sods, including a book about serial killer Dennis Nilssen, another about witchcraft and satanism in modern times and a collection of short stories about Jack the Ripper. And a couple of Gor novels as well - although I'm not able to really fathom why I picked them up. Before you jump to the obvious conclusions, no I don't think so.   The prices were pretty amazing - this entire haul cost me about Rs. 250 - I doubt I'd be able to get more than 4 or 5 second hand books for that amount in Bangalore. It's definitely worth swinging by Madras at least once in three months or so.   Well, here's hoping the senseless persecution of this noble industry in Madras ends...

       mortals tickle the lord  (busy bums beemuse the restive; the prentice seeking Sentience)  some pending issue of a back-handed prescription has snowballed into bits of irregular second-hand petitioning, seeking concerted attention of a few nobodies in particular.  by pact, all action has been resigned.  : apparently rejected as a cwack of impooper diagnosis, the suggestion promptly receded in foreign winds, only to float into willing hands that can scratch the deepest furrow.   lord word chucked a laugh, without much Definition.  (he would later run madly down the stairs, screaming "man is happy!")  the key-maker, his wares on the floor, examining every scratch, smoothens his forehead, sucking a spliff for relaxation. his master key works on most doors, but some window in the south refuses to shut.  his compatriot, the scavenger, has given up his gathering; he cannot handle the mess (there was once a lone gust of aimless junk, before the prolonged lull).  both apprentices irate over misgivings, honour and profession; the key-maker would rather shape notes (but even they are all scratchy); the scavenger might just become the municipal corporation (but there is no quotation on that); he eyes his junk short-sightedly, envisioning a sweeping display in some blessed halls that are so empty.  the key-maker claims an opening.  he has observed the lock for years.  the key-hole hasn't grown!  he peeks through and exclaims at the world.  (quickly jotting down a frenzy of realization, it seems: i have learned nothing, stupid mortal, the lessons are lined up to the grave; looks around for discussion, finds none, and temporally satisfied*, seeks more Relaxation)  the crowing outside chased a pigeon into the south window. the sight, unfamiliar claimed some, was excretiating. the hags shooed and sighed at the cocky intruder rubbing its head with a broken left wing.  in the middle of the sill (on the threshold as it were), it crapped a perfect turd.  (everybody fell rolling on the floor, launching scattered keys at the window; they were reassured, misunderstanding. all laughed but the key-maker)  *the dissatisfaction kept them awake.

      my dear devoted mother took herself up to the teaching profession long before realising she could actually help kids in learning. she was bored (seriously), and even as a kid i could sit locked up at home peacefully (there was a sneak-out route).  so she has been teaching tirelessly for two decades, now promoted to superlative post of academic supervisor, always collecting precious bonuses from after-hour neighbourhood tutoring.  and throughout her course, she would slam her head and shut her eyes, frustrated over it all. the junior classes too noisy, loud brats, then middle-school oblivion, and high-school melodramas, all added to the chief headache of fellow incompetent colleagues, and the disgusting business-minded principal mis-guides. she was never visibly happy, in fact only expressing working satisfaction over tea with well-dressed guests; being busy was good enough, that was all. as time would have it, indeed during an obscure phase in my career, i was offered the chance to address school children about subjects like poetry, children's classics, and the importance of extra-curricular activity. the logic was to get out there and have fun with kids.  in filling out weekly reports (the only teacher-like privilege, apart from corridor salutations) i would scrawl out the two words 'good fun' for every class attended (those were words in the boss' brief). but even this institution i was with then is completely driven by what we disgustedly called bullheaded marketing cows, of the ubiquitous kind. the purpose was just to get to the children (:no appropriate message involved). and they would all remember, either ways, good teachers or bad, and they will all grow up to buy. even at home, everything is taken for granted as being unnecessarily painful, not worth more than a bah! earlier, i was forced to think this was what a mid-life crisis meant; soon, the definitions changed, as this life begain to seem unending; and now it is a lifetime of ageless crises. the toast burned too much, lights not switched off, expensive toned milk .. everybody from baby to grand daddy pissed off. mebbe in the days of open country joy, all of it was simple and natural, and so much less to think about that there was no worry (unidentifiable to us, at least); and the material world raised so many other emotions, the disgusted portions glowing purple. let us all be happy. and peaceful.

      I've been noticing that a lot of people don't enjoy what they claim to like.  Let me explain.  I've been across many book lovers who claim that lately, they just can't finish anything they start, can't relate to the stories or the characters or anything in most of the books they pick up. Music lovers suddenly claim everything suddenly sounds trvial and boring. One person I've  come across just doesn't seem to enjoy anything anymore. He cribs about every book, song, movie or whatever he comes across.  What is this all about? Is this certain proof that art is dead, human creativity has reached a point of total stagnation and mediocrity is all that remains?   Maybe. Every era has either believed itself to be a golden age or an age of decay. Both assessments are usually exagerated.   I think the more important reason is a lot simpler.  It's not a simple case of overdoing it. You can read four books a week (or even a day) and still enjoy most of it.   Too much of anything kills the thrill, but what really messes it up is your attitude.   Yes, it's in the mind.  The trouble begins when the mindset of 'I know what it's all about, it's all the same, show me something NEW' sets in. That is essentially a passive attitude, and it is basically flawed because all art is interactive at heart. It needs you to respond, to be willing to jump in.  We are all only human beings. Every work of art we create basically plays wth the same humanly experienced spectrum of colours, sounds, emotions and so on. At some level, there are going to be commonalities between everything.  The trick is to retain that sense of wonder, that willingnes to enter a new wolrd on its own terms, not yours. Imagining you know everything is only going to make you bored and boring.   Everything is new. Nothing is new. It doesn't matter.   Just wade in with as few preconceptions as you can, even if you think you've seen it all. At the end of that, if you've really tried to get into it, and it still doesn't, that's when it's reasonable to conclude that its a piece of crap, at least as far as you are concerned, and move on.

      What is music? Is it a set of rules and norms? Is it a primal expression of human being?   Is music something that was made by white men prior to the 19th Century? Or is it something created by black Americans in the 20th century? Is it a set of scales and songs laid down by musician-saints centuries ago? Is it all, any, or some of these?  Is music about composition or performance? Does music need musicians? Does music need composers? Does music need intruments? Do we need music?   Is music only made by human beings? What about birdsong? What about the songs of the trees, the rivers, the sky and the wind? Are whale songs music or language?   Is music a language? Is it an universal language or is it a lot of different languages and dialects? What about words and music? Is hip-hop music or is it poetry with a beat? Is devotional music as much music as the songs of Diecide? Is it music if you destroy your instruments at the end? Can music have a philosophy or an ideology? Is music timeless or is it trend-driven?

To understand this, we consider the history of natural history and science in poetry (from Ancient Greece through the early 20th Century, when Science Fiction and Fantasy became recognized as distinct genres) .. Poetry was at one time the language of philosophy, science, and all serious thought. Major treatments of Science expressed as Poetry included the works of (many) .. until Pythagoras identified music with mathematics (and) distinguished Poetry from Rhetoric, and poetry began to separate from science.   .. Aristotle has begun the split between "high art" and mere science or science fiction in verse .. (he) goes on to comment: "Poetry demands either a great natural quickness of parts, or an enthusiasm allied to madness. By the first of these we mould ourselves with facility to the imitation of every form; by the other, transported out of ourselves, we become what we imagine"    The enthusiasm allied to madness -- recalled by Shakespeare as "the lunatic, the lover, and the poet are of imagination all compact" -- leads to Coleridge's emphasis on imagination ..  SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY POETRY is paradoxically at the imaginative core of the genre, yet exiled to the extreme periphery of the professional market. This reflects 20th Century science fiction and fantasy prose, cinema, and television as having virtually displaced poetry as our culture's supreme repository of cosmic, outlandish, and transcendental ideas.    In the 21st Century, hypertext, hypermedia, multimedia, virtual reality, and other technology may similarly displace science fiction and fantasy non-interactive visuals and prose ..  Both Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry reflect Coleridge's distinction between "Fancy" (the basis of most mainstream poetry) with the superior "imagination" in a unique sense of creation, vitality, organicity, and passion, similar to Tolkein's "subcreation."  ..  [then somebody says:]  "The poets see the divine beauty of nature as enhanced, not lessened, by scientific explanation..."   Here is the mundane bias starkly put: that while only Science Fiction reflects the reality of technological acceleration, it does not include the "better" literature.     Science Fiction Poets aim to disprove this, as Huxley seems to urge in his final sentence:  "let us advance together, men of letters and men of science, further and further into the ever-expanding regions of the unknown."  .. It is commonly, but wrongly, thought that Science and Poetry are in opposition.    .. Centuries in the future, Graves' fictional poet Vives writes: 		Charlatans came forward, 		Boldly adopting titles 		Of mathematical virtue. 		Square Root of Minus One 		Proclaimed himself a dictator 		And swelled a private grudge 		By arithmetical progression 		Into a mad crusade.  Wordsworth contrasts the scientific and humanist spirit: 		Our meddling intellect 		Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:-- 		We murder to dissect. 		Enough of Science and Art; 		Close up those barren leaves; 		Come forth, and bring with you a heart 		That watches and receives.  [why do i queer feel, so old is all of this?] {saving grace was then read, (even that) written well in time}  Some special mention must be made of major authors who are far better known for their prose or their mainstream poetry, but who have produced science fiction and fantasy poetry of great merit.  [this one verse most organic, and pure, redefines nothing, just lookin'other way, so much more there is to say, even more to discover, and learn, to be sure.]  JOHN UPDIKE: "Ode to Rot" 		... let rot 		proclaim its revolution: 		the microscopic hyphae sink 		the fangs of enzymes into the rosy peach 		and turn its blush a yielding brown, 		a mud of melting glucose: 		once staunch committees of chemicals now vote 		to join the invading union, 		the former monarch and constitution routed 		by the riot of rhizoids, 		the thalloid consensus....

      Aha.  Yesterday I got my salary and paid off a couple of outstanding debts. There are still a couple left, but what a relief.  I also picked up a SHITLOAD of Sci-Fi novels AND Forrest J. Ackerman's World of Science fiction. Full joy.  After all that I visited a couple of my old pubs. Had a brandy drink with honey and pepper in Styx and listened to some Judas Priest and exchanged glances with a pretty woman who was with some dog and like that.   Followed by a couple of beers in Pecos to the accompaniment of Phish and some friends I hadn't met for quite a while and Elangovan (the manager) chiding me for not turning up more often and loud ugly women laughing entirely too loudly in the background.   Some things never do change...

      Life is so wierd. But technology can save the day. At least a little.  Today at work, I needed to have some hard copies a client had sent me typed into MS Word. For some odd reason the lady whose job it is to handle this sort of thing refused. Why doesn't she want to do her job? Where would I be if I took that kind of stand? Wierd.   Luckily, we have this Character Recognition software in the office, so I had the documents scanned in and OCR'ed. However, the last two documents were rather bad xerox xopies and al the noise in the document had completely confused the software. So those two had to be typed in anyhow. Having handled the rest of the job on my own (with a little help from my friend, the God of Technology) I was able to pull a little senti blackmail and get the aforementioned lady to type these two in.   I still can't figure why this had to take up so much of my time. I really do have more important stuff to do. Ah well...

      Last month, I picked up a copy of Asylum Years, an anthology of songs by Tom Waits. For various reasons, I really haven't been able to listen to the CD - until last night. With my flatmate and his rock hardliner buddies out of the picture, I could play the album at the volume that any new piece of music deserves to be explored at.   I really don't know too much about Tom Waits - my only previous experience has been a single song I heard at a friends place more than a year back. I don't even remember much about that song. In fact I have no rational idea at all why I shelled out a tidy 525 rupees for the CD. All I can say is, thank Zark for good instincts.  The gravelly voice, the sardonic, poetic, tender, cruel lyrics, the smooth, sly jazzy background music - oh yes. I like it very good. I have a feeling Waits is going to be another trip for me like Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen. I suppose I should be writing about this in a more profound, critically perceptive way, but really, it's just some songs that I enjoyed listening to.

      Well, for the first time ever, I've put up a response to a story I liked and gotten a response to my response from the writer. I love the Internet. (hugs terminal fondly. ceases upon noticing bemused looks on colleague's faces).  The story in question is  urlLink Douglas Lain's 'The '84 Regress' , published on the Infinite Matrix. That site allows you to post reponses, so I posted mine:   'I really enjoyed the story! I especially loved the bit about the teenage kid selling pills that can take you to the sort of future that SHOULD have happened (Art Deco cars...I want my Art Deco cars. Preferably with aerial capabilities!) I grew up in the 80s but I pretty much ignored them...still, a few nostalgic resonances were thrown up.'   Well, I generally tend to spew my 2 annas worth all over the Net without really expecting a response. So I was quite thrilled to discover, a few weeks later, this response from Mr. Lain hisself:   'I'm glad you liked it.  These days I'm nostalgic for the future most of the time.  Art Deco cars will be arriving just as soon as Apple Computers start making cars.'   I'm fairly certain its him, by the way. The associated e-mail ID is the same as the one on his own homepage. Not an earth-shattering exchange of correspondance, but it's kinda nice to be able to let someone know you liked their work, and also nice to know that they appreciate your opinion. Okay, I'm ending this before I use the word 'nice' again...oops, I just did...

      Music as the true psychedelic. An amusing conceit, Deep Joy. Although, considering the over-inflated egos most musicians in my experience tend to have, I shudder to imagine the heights of megalomania such a turn of events would inspire them to!  I would like to suggest that, rather than music, it is the mind itself that is the ultimate trip. If one day all our reserves of drugs are over, we may turn to music, the arts, spiritualiy or even religion to fill that void. But ultimately, none of these inputs mean anything without the context of our human minds and brains. It is a fairly well known fact, I think, that the effects of any drug, even the stronger psychedelics, depend as much on 'set' and 'setting' as it does on the actual chemical interactions between the substance and the human organism. But this is getting too close to the whole debate we all recently had. Enough said.  Regarding your views on SF, I would just like to assure you that the genre is a lot broader than you seem to assume. Good old-fashioned science-driven space opera may still hold the spotlight, but the genre is far wider than that. There is room in it for such luminaries as George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Franz Kafka as well as the more obvious Asimovs and Clarkes. The hard-sf Stephen Baxters and Greg Bears are balanced out by the romantics like Ursula K LeGuin or Cordwainer Smith. All of them in turn are balanced out by sly, revolutionary potboilers like Ken MacLeod. And so on.   Ultimately, SF is far more than extrapolations of scientific specuation - it is an attempt to envisage and understand the limitless range of possible worlds this universe contains. Fantasy adds to the fun by extending the range to totally impossible worlds. Horror makes it all seems a very dangerous place. Literature, ancient or modern, captures the same sense of wonder or terror without resorting to obvious stage-dressing in the form of interstellar space or some fantastic world. Mainstream fiction offers me none of this. Well that's enough preaching for now, I think. TIme for work...

      'Science Fiction' is yet to really fascinate me; I find myself biding time over the few such books on my shelf, and am probably content with the thought that they will never get old to read, even much, much later.  The ideas and fantastic creations available in this genre do interest me, almost like new-age gloss-illustrated comic book magazines: fun to read, nothing more. I admit that most concepts and suppositions in these contexts are far beyond me; that they are works of fiction, envisioning the great beyond/exploring the frontiers of humanity (where even 'humanity' turns a subordinate term), does arouse admiration in my mind, but I do not find the sense of reality that (this is an absurd comment to make here, but the point is I find that) makes reading a true pleasure*. While my reading has so far been through only most popular works, I have assured myself that this lifetime is far too incomplete without such understanding; I continue to hoard books, and the intention to actually read them all, sometime.  (*try poetry)  Nonetheless, even lesser mortals are entitled to musing about the future, and this little thought makes me smile a lot: ever wondered about a stage in time when all the 'substance' in the world is spent? With humans constantly craving for the elusive perpetual high, 'clean flight', in turn exploring newer alternatives (all of which are actually old, getting continually revived) just for intoxication. There must arise a situation where people get back to the realisation that music provides the greatest 'kick' or 'high'.  Then we could have little coin-booths on street corners, where 'junkys' can dial-up to listen to some select strain/song/chord, for the sake of sliding down helpless, sedated, in intolerable pleasure. Peddlers would have to pick up musical instruments to push their wares; solo artists can grow little underground gangs, the big bands takeover as 'drug' lords; music coursing through the veins in everybody. Wouldn't we all be so much happier then?

      Went back and pulled out this one paragraph from 'The Overcoat' by Nikolai Gogol. The book says Gogol died, quite mad, in 1852. It says he was called a realist, a romantic, and even a 'fantast'. For me, 'The Overcoat' read like a lesson on writing to illustrate truth. - It was, the truth must be told, most difficult for him in the beginning to get habituated to such limitations, but later it did turn into a matter of habit, somehow, and everything went well; he even became perfectly trained to going hungry of evenings; on the other hand, however, he had spiritual sustenance, always carrying about in his thoughts the eternal idea of the new overcoat. From this time forth it seemed as if his very existence had become somehow fuller, as though he had taken unto himself a wife, as though another person was always present with him, as though he were not alone but as if an amiable feminine helpmate had consented to traverse the path of life side by side with him - and this feminine helpmate was none other than this very same overcoat, with a thick quilting of cotton wool, with a strong lining that would never wear out.  -

      I finished Wright's The Golden Age this week. It was as good as all the raving blurbs promised, for once. It's the sort of SF that's willing to be bigger than the genre itself, that's not ashamed to pack in references and devices that may seem to belong to a more 'highbrow' literary circle. The ideas are many, and immense. Where this book scored over Kingsbury's Psychohistorical Crisis, another recent SF read of immense scope, was in its greater cohesiveness in theme. The prose is elegant, sometimes beautiful, with just a touch of the classic to it. Classic, but not old-fashioned is the best I can describe it as. The pacing is good, the characterisation subtle and convincing. For instance, the character of Phaethon's wife seemed oddly incomplete to me at first - and sure enough, it was soon revealed that the lady was not Phaethon's wife at all but an imperfect copy. I'm genuinely looking forward to the sequel, The Phoenix Rising.  I'm also plodding through one of Norman's Gor novels. It really isn't as sexually explicit as I'd feared, but neither is the raw pulp kick of the actual story as satisfying as I'd hoped. I just feel lukewarm about the whole thing.  Another ongoing read is LE Modessit Jr's The Order War. Moddessit is probably one of the few really interesting and different fantasy authors I've read - his books, at least the Recluce sequence, are about the struggle between Chaos and Order rather than the usual war between Good and Evil. The solution his heroes seem to be inching towards is a state of balance rather than victory for either side. This alone places him head and shoulders above the simplistic moral struggles that most fantasy seems to focus on. Another interesting feature of the series is that the main protagonists seem to be as much scientists as they are sorcerers. There's as much engineering as there is magic in these books. Also, the machinations of the warring parties are more by way of subtle strategy and strong tactics rather than the endless intrigue and counter-intrigue you would find in a Robert Jordan. I need to express that last point a bit better, but I think I'll leave it as it is for now.  Lastly, I'm reading Brian Well's book on Psychedelic Drugs. An account written by a British academic during the late 60s, it is the most balanced book on the topic I've read in while. Which is to say, Wells has no axe to grind either pro or con. Although, by and large, he is far more positive about the psychedelics than I tend to be. Which is also a good thing, I guess.   I've also started out on Ken MacLeod's Dark Light. As of now, I'm in no position to make any sort of objective assessment - I'm just thrilled to be back in the hands of one of my favourite storytellers! Nearly a year back, MacLeod was the writer who re-awakened my love for SF. Anything I say about his books is going to be influenced by that fact, for a while to come. Try him out, if you haven't already done so and you'll see why.

      It's getting along reasonably well, I think. Yesterday, I manged to keep off most of the day. However, I copped a couple of drags off a friend at around 6.30 pm. I find it's a little hard to resist a smoke when I'm sitting around in a cafe - the whole setting has become a deeply ingrained context for lighting up. So that's something to keep in mind. Sunday I chickened out totally and bought a cigarette. Then I chucked it away after two drags. Through the day I've taken a couple of drags from friends' cigarettes - I need to be a little more careful about that.   Physical effects seem insignificant as yet - no constipation or anything, but there is a mild feeling of acidity which may not be related. More than anything else, I'm beginning to realise how smoking had become a tool for spending and even allocating time, and also a way to partially distance myself from a lot of things - a smokescreen in every sense of the word. That will be the hardest to deal with.   Still, I figure I should be able to kick this. After all, I've been able to drastically cut down both alcohol and sweet leaf. In fact, I think I've more or less stopped actively wanting to drink - instead, as and when friends decide to have a drink, I either join them or not. I've even said no to a spliff many times in the recent past. All this is just an attempt to re-assure myself that I can do this. Well, that's enough of that for now.

      To what extent is music really an enduring form that can transcend times and trends?  Recordings of artists at the very edge of the modern era of sound technology often sound quaint and obscure to us - and not just because of the sound quality. I have come across people who ordinarily like blues music but have found it exceedingly hard to relate the sound they think of as 'the blues' to those old Albert Johnson recordings. So many of his songs are so familiar to us in souped-up citified modernised versions, it's hard for some to step back to the way the original performance sounded.   Similarly, when the first Nativity In Black compilation was released, it had an opposite effect to what may have been intended, for many listeners. People who had never heard Sabbath before and picked up their albums after hearing this tribute, done by more modern, fast and heavy bands like Megadeth, Sepultura and the likes, often expressed a dissapointment with the originals - they were just too SLOW.  And what about western classical music? Sure, we have musical scores, which are supposed to be an inalterable record of how the music is meant to sound. Yet, even the most rigid score leaves room for subtle or not-so-subtle shades of interpretation. Without even recordings of the sort of performance preferred by the original composers, how can we be sure our modern-day classical interpreters are in fact giving us the straight groove, the way those old cats in their odd jackets laid it down?  Again, the music of just a decade back can already sound very dated and awkward, in every genre of popular music. What seemed like a slick new sound can very rapidly change into an awkward anachronsim, like all those '80 albums by '70s artists with their embarassing big-tom, studio-polished sound. Roger Waters' 'Radio KAOS' is a case in point.  So if the way the same notes are played can differ, or if  the way the same artist sounds can change so radically, what exactly is eternal or timeless about any of this?

      It's simple stuff working out well that gives me the greatest satisfaction.   Today, we suddenly had to create a new section for a clients intranet, to go live tomorrow morning. As this is a closed network, there is no way to make sure our onsite team takes through the inputs which we send them correctly, short of actually going there ourselves. Which makes no sense.   So I casually told one of my colleagues to ask the onsite chap to send us copies of the new pages once he finished. A few hours later they came in, and we were able to catch one serious mistake and a couple of more subtle errors.   It was just a throwaway, spur of the moment idea but I feel inordinately proud of it because it made a real ass-saving difference and can actually be used again in the future.  I'm so proud of me...  On another note, I finally sent Prem some pictures and content for the site about my great-grandfather, S. Satyamurti that I've asked him to help me with. Even though he is currently up to his eye-teeth in work, he got back to me right away with a first-cut design that I found mind-bendingly beautiful. These brilliant little Prems...

      This is just sheer genius, that's all.   I have this anthology of poems in translation called Poem Into Poem. The collection is based on the premise that translating a poem is, because of the unique way in which poetry manipulates langauge, virtually impossible. What a good translation achieves is the creation of a secondary poem that is more or less connected to the original and may or may not serve as a bridge to the original, since it can be a valid, independant work of art on its own. The anthology includes translations of poets from Sappho to Baudelaire by a variety of English-language poets. The poems in the collection amply justify the compilers thesis.  What the Manic Street Preachers have achieved with their cover of Nirvana's 'Been A Son' is something very similar. The original song, a jagged lament about a wayward girl (yes I know there are enough of those already, but what the hell?) is an aggressive/droning punk inspired slab of typical 90s rock - the stuff the critics call grunge. You can hear it most easily on the Nirvana b-sides collection, Incesticide.  The Manix approach to this song is totally unexpected. The overdriven guitar, the pounding bass and the kinetic drums are gone, replaced by an acoustic slide guitar and slight percussion. What seemed to be indelibly, unalterably grungy punk music has been transformed into a chilled out groove that sounds a lot like folk blues.   This might seem like an absurd, unlikely reconstruction of the Nirvana original - in fact, it flows clean, clear and compelling out of the speakers as possibly the best tribute to Nirvana I've ever heard. By stripping away the musical trappings and recreating the song in an entirely new setting, the Manix have actually underlined one aspect of Kurt Cobain that people tend to overlook - he was a really good songwriter, all said and done and been and gone.   You can hear the Manix version of 'Been A Son' on Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Manic Street Preachers, the recently released collection of b-sides and rarities. For the sake of comparison, try and locate their cover of Nirvana's 'Pennyroyal Tea' as well - I once found it somewhere on the 'net but cannot recall exactly where right now.

      An article I wrote for the MetalIndia 'zine:  About a decade back, there was this vision of what extreme metal could be. It would be tight, precise, intricate and immensely heavy. The visceral bludgeon of the music would be matched by uncompromisingly cerebral, thought-provoking lyrics. The vision included a hope that this sound could actually be created right here, in this country, in this city that they call Bangalore, by us, not somewhere else by someone else.  Fate had other plans of course. Reality intervened – people had studies, people finished studies and got jobs, people shifted their musical leanings, people stopped playing altogether, and so on. But at least one of us never did give up on that dream. It might be dedication, or just fixation, but there’s no doubt that it is an inspired madness.  For the last 4 years, KP Krishnamoorthy, guitarist, composer and situational vocalist has been fronting his on-again, off-again metal project Mindsnare with a single-minded intensity. Quite early on, he recognized that he had a set of fairly unique ideas about how the whole metal conundrum could be addressed, and that these ideas would not be easy to execute unless he put together an ensemble that was clearly created for this purpose.  That’s when Mindsnare’s first incarnation was created. I was on board at the time, as a bassist and lyrical accomplice. We failed to find a suitable drummer, aborted the project and I moved on to other things. But not before KP put together the Mindsnare:1 mini-album, a self-produced CD with three original songs, including The Uncertainty Principle and one cover. KP played six and four string guitars, sang and programmed the drum parts on this recording.  KP has come a long way since those three songs, but they contain, in embryo, everything that the Mindsnare sound is about. Complex, unusually structured songs that use riffage as an orchestral element rather than in the traditional sense of repeated motifs, a predilection for odd time-signatures and exotic scales, and lyrics that reflect a rather introspective take on life and everything that goes with it. A sound that is very distinct and very KP. I think the recording was done as a sort of ‘last will and testament’, at the time. But it has gained a following, over the years. At this point, fate intervened. The second part of the odd jigsaw that makes up Mindsnare fell into place. Yasmin Kazi, a refugee from the torment of rock n roll singing had decided to give it all up and instead take on the torment of rock n roll drumming. At this point, KP met her and oddly, enough they decided that she just may be the drummer he’d been looking for.  Extreme metal was not an instinctual choice for Yasmin - although she’d heard a wide range of music, she’d usually identified herself more with the classic British metal end of the spectrum. But something about the project appealed to her - the unique mix of utter heaviness with the structural detail and math-rock forays normally associated with prog struck her as a challenge really worth taking up. It hasn’t been an easy transition, but over the years she has developed an approach to playing drums for Mindsnare that is heavy, laced with intriguing details at the right moments, and very Yasmin.  The third part of this puzzle has been that elusive missing link for the longest time. The four-string duties on the songs recorded for the Headbangalore compilation CD were handled by Sam, who has since left to form his own band. The songs from this era were a little more focused than the early material, but not by very much. Next, old friend and co-conspirator from the fun, clueless kid-metal-band days, Visahan, stepped in as bassist/vocalist. The combination was perfect – personalities gelled, chemistry occurred. New songs were written - including Searching for the Maze and Mirror that reflected a growing confidence and coherence in the way they expressed the vision that has always guided the Mindsnare sound. Sadly, external realities intervened at this point and rendered Visahan unavailable for further musical journeys.  This was when Mindsnare ground to a halt again. But once again, a series of happy coincidences converged and the band are back with a new bassist, Narayan. Again, this sort of extreme metal is not quite his mainstay. He plays for Mindsnare because he finds the basic musical concepts intriguing and challenging.  And I would suggest that this is Midnsnare’s greatest strength - rather than being a clan of generic metalheads creating generic metal music, they are an assemblage of musicians from differing traditions who pool their sensibilities to create a unique new alloy of metal.

      i've been in bed for three weeks now, nursing a throbbing left leg. my only way of covering ground is by clomping about on lightweight aluminium-frame crutches. at times i can try and swing on them, keeping rhythm in my armpits, but this metal bar bolted inside my leg keeps pinching me for attention. got my chance to head outside of home once last week, with a doctor's appointment. and that proved to be a chance to ride the roads with a friendly rickshaw rider - an experience very rare in any city. he responded calmly to my pleas for a slow and steady ride, and immediately rode down to a cruise, with a faint fluttering hum that seemed to come from directly under my bum. these rear-engine versions are pretty comfortable i thought, and he began a conversation. to my un-celebratory chagrin, he mentions the bollywood star who has broken a leg too, and laughs bursting into a song - one of those with meaningful words, thankfully. so i peacefully got all the stitches and staples removed from my leg, and headed on for a night with the boys. strong painkillers don't work as good.  a few days later, while i sat rueing over lost ground in time, gently rubbing the healing wounds, and generally deploring orthopaedic professionals, something sprouted unexpectedly.  the tip of a nylon thread, well-knotted, and hard with dried blood. the violet-coloured little thing had arisen from under the hide on my knee, to even suggest colourful surgical implementation.  while i sat bewildered and blankly bemused by it, frantic calls by my folks to the doc confirmed this was nothing to worry about, seriously. and i could double the painkillers if i want to. the string has been bathed and cleaned now, and the frayed fibres rub softly. once it was made clear that this was a mistake, the doc hastily confided in regular 'only human' talk. routine affair. run along. even we have a sense of irony.

      Whatever slight powers of allurement I posess kind of kicked in on the weekend, largely to my chagrin. The sad thing is, animal magnetism seems to swing both ways, even if the animal in question doesn't.  On Saturday, I was loitering at a streetside book stall down MG Road when this short, wannabe-Bong-intellectual looking chap sidles up to me and says 'Excuse me...are you a model?' Cheese personified. I've heard that line used on girls so many times. Does the man think people actually fall for this stuff? Or maybe the IQ of the average homo is just that much lower. Anyway, I  brusquely replied in the negative and made an exit, post-haste. Pity, because I'd been thumbing through a rather interesting volume on Dali.  On Sunday, I was entering one of my standard coffee consuming and time wasting locations when a silver-haired, distinguished looking gent in a kurta pops up in front of me and asks 'Excuse me...are you from Bangalore?' I replied that I was and carried on up the stairs to the loo. As I took a turn in the steps, I glanced back for no real reason and noticed he was still looking at me. Putting this out of my mind, I entered the loo, chose a receptacle, unzipped and assumed the urinary stance when suddenly the gent sidles up into the stall next to mine. This was a bit creepy for me. I quickly shoved my bits back in, zipped up and skedaddled. Can't a lad even take a piss in peace these days? I ask you.  Well all this gaydom had had a very negative effect on my morale. A sad and shattered man, I dragged my loathsome carcass down to a music store. Where I chanced upon a girl handing out leaflets about some free offer. She had the most lovely eyes I've seen in a while and a nice smile too. I didn't pay too much attention to her spiel, just gazed deep into her light brown eyes, hopefully giving her the full force of my dark brown eyes at the same time. After a few minutes she blinked and we disengaged. Later, while I was leaving the store, she just happened to waft across my field of vision, giving me a rather warm smile. As I left, I looked back to see she was looking back to see if I was looking back to see if she was looking at me...  Life is just a slow train, crawling up a hill.

       No two people ever read the same book. The process of reading is far too complex for that. The mute symbols imprinted on blank paper are only a part of the intricate mechanism of written linguistic communication; the inert words can only spring to full-bodied life on the vibrant stage of a receptive mind. Even the best of writers can do no more than outline, suggest; the mind of the reader must translate those symbols into color and action, into drama and comedy and tragedy. Sometimes magic happens. Characters live and love and die, whole worlds leap to breathless life--all within the reader's mind. But since no two minds are the same, each performance must be different. We cannot even read the same book twice. The book is frozen--never changing--almost a ghost of its author. We, however, are mutable creatures of flesh. However short the interim, we have continued our, perhaps unnoticed, mental evolution.     -Patrick H Adkins

      " Life would be much simpler if there were not so many rules. I imagine I have broken every rule of English grammar several thousand times and being at heart a purist, I should be desolated if I was aware of it, but as I do not know a single one of these rules, I am saved much mental anguish. "    " When I first started in to write, I was sort of ashamed of it as an occupation for a big, strong, healthy man, so I kept it a secret. No one helped me. No one knew what I was doing -- not even my closest friends. Now I've come to the conclusion that writing is a 'pretty nice' way to make a living. "   " There is a vast difference between seeing life and living life. I believe I have done the latter. In fact I don't think I could have written much if I hadn't. (ERB had served in the US Cavalry in Arizona, been a gold miner in Oregon, a policeman in Salt Lake City, a cowboy in Idaho...) [But]...It is necessary for nearly all of us to acquire part of our 'experience' second hand. Yet this should never be permitted to overshadow the greater art of imagination. "   " Get the habit of work and quit being an "inspirational" author -- which is merely another name for a loafer. Don't wait for ideas to come. Go after them. Don't write every now and then. Write every day, if only for a little while. Be a worker, not a poseur. The only real "literary people" are those who work at it. Those who make good are the ones who keep so busy that they have no time to show off. "   " (Tarzan) was just a character that happened to catch the public's fancy; interest in him grew until it astonished me. As a boy I love the story of Romulus and Remus, who founded Rome, and I love, too, the boy Mowgli in Kipling's "Jungle Books." I suppose Tarzan was the result of those early loves. Perhaps the fact that I lived in Chicago and yet hated cities and crowds of people made me sense, my escape from unpleasant reality. Perhaps that is the reason for his success with modern readers. Maybe he takes them, too, away from humdrum reality. Mrs. Burroughs calls me a low-brow. I guess I am, but then so are the most of us, aren't we? Perhaps that is another reason why Tarzan appeals to the mass of people rather than to a select few. "   " I find that a considerable part of my work in writing fiction has nothing whatsoever to do with fiction. It is based upon the belief that highly imaginative fiction, such as I write, demands the retention of a youthful and elastic mind, to achieve which one of my principal aims in life is to keep my body physically fit and my mind responsive to a diversity of simple stimuli. "   " If you've written a good story, don't lose faith in it if it does not sell -- but first be positive that it really is a good story.... Even now, I often have a difficult time finding publishers for my latest books. I get lots of rejections. "   " For me, temperance is essential to good work. Simple amusements are the most desirable, and so far I have successfully avoided the acquisition of any sort of a hobby. My own observation leads me to believe that a single hobby is too narrowing an influence for a fiction writer and I should rather suggest the greater value of an interest in many things. I find that it is better to have a little knowledge of many things than an expert knowledge of one... "   " If you write one story, it may be bad; if you write a hundred, you have the odds in your favor. Play the long shots. It's better, of course, to write one good script than a hundred poor ones, but usually you must write a hundred poor ones before you can do one good one. "

      Well, I got the first installment of the Prophecykeeper's e-course. Not touch yet, unless this qualifies: 'EARTH MOTHER CRYING: Encyclopedia of Native People's Prophecies of Terror Preceding an Age of Universal Peace - $14.99 download'. Still, it's not like they require you to download this.   The first part of the 'lesson' itself deals with a series of myths among native Americans, from North and South America,about a character collectively known as the 'True White Brother'. These myths very clearly reflect a familiar culprit, Jesus the carpenter's son. I need to figure out the chronology of this - but it does seem to me that these stories sound like the sort of thing that would be spread by Christian misionaries, as filtered through generations of re-telling, if they are not outright fabulations.   The source used for all this is L. Taylor Hansen's 'He Walked The Americas' which you can read online here:http://blueotter.addr.com/he-walked-the-americas/index.htm  Now the thing is, the only L Taylor Hansen I've been able to locate who might be a likely perp, is Louise Tayler Hansen, an early writer of SF and sci-fact for Amazing and other Golden Age pulps. SF writers, when they write fact, tend to fall into two broad categories: Asimovian expounders of hard fact, and Hubbardish mad prophets.   I wonder which kind Louise was? I'll have to read her entire book, and then find some way to learn more about native American folklore, before I can say anything. This is getting to be fun...  One site claims that L. Taylor Hansen was/is an archaeologist and 'emminent diffusionist researcher' but if so, he/she seems to have left no traces apaprt from this book. Her bio (if it is the same person, the bibliography appended does not include this book) on the isfdb makes no mention of this, but it is rather sketchy.

      All right. Oral sex tips for women, by a woman!!! From one of them 'girltalk' sites.   Here goes:   Tips for you doing it to him:     Act like you want to be there. A woman who's performing simply because she has to is the number-one passion killer.  OK, but not all of us are so picky, as long as you're performing.   Don't bite (unless he asks for it). Keep your teeth covered at all times with your lips. Ouchies! Pay attention, girls!   Don't be too rough. Yanking back the foreskin, sucking too hard, pumping up and down like you're trying to draw water from a dry well ... it ain't nice!  Looks cool in porn flicks, though.   Educate yourself. Ask your boyfriend what he likes, your girlfriends what work for them and pay attention to sex scenes in books and movies. The more you find out and read up about, the better.  Lots of benefits here. Women who actually WANT to know what I want would be quite a plus, and if they start amassing their own porn collections in the spirit of knowledge, all the better.   Don't act as if semen is poison. You don't have to swallow, but you don't need to run out of the room either. Don't leave him in the lurch -- switch to using your hand or let him leave a little mess elsewhere on your body.  I feel a little embarassed at this point. Wonder why?   This was followed by 'tips on him doing it to you' and a little essay on why men dig oral sex so much. Maybe I'll review those some other time.

       urlLink Prophecykeepers  is 'The ONLY Indian / Tribal / Aboriginal / Island Native Prophecy website owned and operated by legally recognized Native American Indians, founded in 1996'.   The vision of one Wallace "Mad Bear" Anderson, Founder of something called the American Indian Unity Movement , it offers comparisons of prophecies from a variety of cultures/religions/countries and offers you 'prophecy messages that will run through your heart like a Buffalo'.   Basically, they believe that 'It is a metter (sic) of history that all the problems of Christians, Jews and Muslims started in one small family, the household of Abraham, several thousand years ago'. And that there are 'simple solutions and answers for you'. They run through a bit of William yeats, and then say that these answers can be found in Hopi and Christian sacred texts.    9/11, Mother Teresa, Utopia (but not for tax-dodgers)   The benefit of accepting their vision? 'You will learn of the ingredients that are missing in a "Tribal/All things common" way of life which assure you divine protection -- even from Nuclear explosions. ' Hmmm. And they say that 9/11 (yes, I was waiting for them to bring that up), which by the way, was predicted by Mother Teresa on her deathbed, was only the first act of terrorism against the US. More will come.   Despite its apparently inclusive aims, the site rapidly shows a distinct bias: 'If you are a Christian, you must expect tribulation. The scriptures say of God that “He Chastens Whom He Loves.” Jesus said, "I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.". So we see now that He came to cause the divisions we see today in order to test us all thoroughly. '  Oh, they have a Utopian model of the perfect society, too, called "All Things Common". 'In this sacred economic plan, you will be no richer than your neighbors. In antiquity, this plan has been used to amass great fortunes and security for its participants.'   Rest assured, though, '"All things common" is not a plan for income tax rebels. Christ instructed all his followers to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, but allowed you to find coins in the mouths of fishes to pay your taxes.' Oh right, they are 'legally recognised Native American Indians', I forgot.  They have several free pdfs for you to download to learn more, if you so desire and free e-courses too. I haven't been able to find an appeal for funds anywhere though - maybe the touch happens only once you actually get in with them? I think I'll register for one of those e-courses and see.   Small SF connection, and a multitude of Gayles:    'Mad Bear also prophesied the eventual flooding of the Salt Lake Valley on his way to the "Gathering of Nations" in South Jordan, Utah back in the early 1970s. This prophecy was corroborated by a vision given to Rolling Thunder, and, some years later by a Mormon woman in "Gayle's Story," (and reportedly by hundreds of other people) and awaits fulfillment.   The famous sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card even suggested this eventual flooding in his book "The Folk of the Fringe."  '  It's not that coincidental, though. I do know that Card is himself a Mormon, and could have had access to 'Gayle's Story', whatever that may be. I've not been able to find it anywhere, though I have found stories by 'Gayles' who have given up smoking, whose daughters were brutally murdered in 1980 and who had two abortions and are not sorry about it. Hmmm...     To be continued...

      Still in the scene-setting stages. At least, this is all I've typed in yet. The scribbles have progressed far beyond. I hope to finish the whole thing over the weekend.  In the meantime, here's another taste:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  In his deepest soliloquies of self doubt, President Lee had to admit to himself this was indeed what his annoying, unstoppably gnawing adversary made him feel like - a huge, annoyed tusker swatting futilely at the most minuscule of gadflies. No matter what he did, the enemy always regrouped, rebuilt, resurrected and came back at him from the most unexpected direction. It was a worldwide game of cat and mouse and he was heartily sick of it all, heartsick of all this tomfooling around.   'What do I do?' he asked no one in particular, on a warm afternoon in one of his many Presidential Palaces, gazing down at gazing down at an ancient river, cradle of civilizations bygone. 'What can I do? How do I place my Godlike thumb' - here holding his right thumb out in front of him, 'on the exact spot' - suiting action to word, he pressed the pad of his thumb onto a sensor imbedded in the gleaming, ebon balcony rail - 'the exact spot, and exert exactly the right pressure,' - here rubbing his thumb into the sensor like an ancient convict providing his jailors with a fingerprint impression - 'to crush this nuisance forever?' By the end of this speech, his voice had taken on a petulant tone and his lower lip was outcast sulkily. Simultaneously, his thumb signal was processed by the Palatial Mind and his pet AI and most trusted advisor, the Phantom MacAevel materialized by his side, not a projection but a subtle re-arrangement of atmospheric molecules to reflect light in a manner calibrated to provide the verisimilitude of a somber, earnest courtier and scholar from long-ago Fiorenza.   MacAevel made his customary formal obeisance then spoke to the President in a mellow, modulated voice, generated by a Databank miles below the Palace and relayed to multi-directional surround speakers hidden in the decorative moulding that encrusted the surfaces around them. Beauty with a purpose, indeed.   'And how may I serve you on this dream-warm afternoon, most venerable Prince?' the Phantom asked.   -----------------------------------------------------------------    To Be continued....

      Well, I'd read, a long time back, that the Icelandic Poetic Edda were a major source-work for Tolkien. Knowing something academically and seeing for yourself are two totally different things, however. A discussion on an SF Forum I sometimes inhabit inspired me to finally go take a look for myself. None of this is original at all, but I'm just tripping on finding things out for myself, humour me.  The Voluspo, or The Wise Woman's Prophecy is the most famous of all the Poetic Edda. In it. Othin/Odin calls on an ancient wise woman to prophesise the future for him. First, she tells him an account of various existing events to prove her wisdom. Having done this, Othin rewards her and she proceeds withthe actual prophecy, which ends on a rather Christian note, probably a later interpolation. The passage in question is:  65.  There comes on high, | all power to hold, A mighty lord, | all lands he rules.   Which, in some versions, includes the lines:   "Rule he orders, | and rights he fixes, Laws he ordains | that ever shall live."   These lines are of doubtful origin, but suggest a subliminal mesage about the unstoppable progress of Christianity. Many old texts, like Beowulf, have such passages, usually bunged in by mediaevel monks who were probably torn between wanting to preserve old tales which were part of their cultural heritage, and making them synch with the religion they now followed.   Getting back to Tolkien, the earlier part of the poem deals, among other things, with the origin of the dwarves and at this point includes a catalogue of dwarven names, supposedly also a later interpolation, which goes like this:  9.  Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats, The holy ones, | and council held, To find who should raise | the race of dwarfs Out of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.   10.  There was Motsognir | the mightiest made Of all the dwarfs, | and Durin next; Many a likeness | of men they made, The dwarfs in the earth, | as Durin said.   11.  Nyi and Nithi, | Northri and Suthri, Austri and Vestri, | Althjof, Dvalin, Nar and Nain, | Niping, Dain, Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur, Nori, An and Onar, | Ai, Mjothvitnir.   12.  Vigg and Gandalf) | Vindalf, Thrain, Thekk and Thorin, | Thror, Vit and Lit, Nyr and Nyrath,-- | now have I told-- Regin and Rathsvith-- | the list aright.   13.  Fili, Kili, | Fundin, Nali, Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur, Frar, Hornbori, | FrÃ¦g and Loni, Aurvang, Jari, | Eikinskjaldi.   14.  The race of the dwarfs | in Dvalin's throng Down to Lofar | the list must I tell; The rocks they left, | and through wet lands They sought a home | in the fields of sand.   15.  There were Draupnir | and Dolgthrasir, Hor, Haugspori, | Hlevang, Gloin, Dori, Ori, | Duf, Andvari, Skirfir, Virfir, | Skafith, Ai.   16.  Alf and Yngvi, | Eikinskjaldi, Fjalar and Frosti, | Fith and Ginnar; So for all time | shall the tale be known, The list of all | the forbears of Lofar.   Lots of old friends there! Interestingly, the name Gandalf is also taken from here, and means 'Magic-Elf' in the original. So now I know.  I believe the Edda also include references to the Path of the Dead - I'll look out for these next.   PS:  try reading those lists of names aloud. Roll them over your tongue, savour each syllable. It's an amazing experience. Don't do it in public, though!

      A rather interesting thought from an article by Fred Bush, on Strange Horizons:   'I wonder if the dotcom frenzy of the '90s robbed science fiction of some good narratives; people who had a dynamite idea for a new electronic product fled to Silicon Valley and got start-up capital rather than writing some stories about what they'd come up with -- imagine if the cyberpunk authors had gotten startup money to produce some of the things in their novels!'  You can read the article in it's entirety (basically it deals with the possibility of using e-bay as a model for interstellar trade in SF) on urlLink Strange Horizons.   You can find it in the 'Articles' section, natch.

      Another work-in-progress. Remember, you saw it here first!!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Henry T. Lee was a troubled man. As Commander In Chief and President In Perpetuity of The Greater Americana, he was, really and truly, what old Alek Sikander, Iolious Kaisar, Charly Maimed, Donald Duck-Egan and Zhiuko Phat before him had only aspired to be - he was The Most Powerful Man In The World. And what a world! A terraformed, cleaned up, sorted out, rationalized, tamed, optimized, New And Improved Gaia. Dolphins frolicked in the gracious canals, gengineered 'dactlys soared in the skies, lumbering mammoths paced the majestic highways and the broad avenues, all in service of Humanity Triumphant. Clean, non-polluting Aircars and Hoverbikes provided speedier transport when it was needed. A happy, prosperous and privileged populace disported itself with dignified gaiety, secure in the knowledge that their once-in-a-lifetime three-year Indentures in the sparklng, sleek Manufactories safely tucked away in Earth Orbit and on Mars (Luna was reserved as a resort for honeymooners and lovers, a sort of Cythera-in-the-Sky) were enough to ensure that the wheels of production kept turning. For those who were more ambitious, or driven, secure niches in Administration, Research or Entertainment could be had for the asking.  But there was one thorn in President Lee’s side, one single serpent - mole, rather - in his Eden. One glitch in his otherwise elegant, unblemished worldcode. One flashpoint of dangerous dissent, arrogant errantry and contemptible contrarianism. He had launched a hundred - no, a thousand - schemes to wipe this irritation off the face of his domain. Sneak attacks, infiltration, siege, even one ill-advised attempt at head-on confrontation that it had taken his crack Goeringspin Docs an entire decade to completely hush up.   The problem was largely one of scale.   His own vantage point was so lofty, his machinery so monumental, that that old bugbear of empiricism, or indeed imperialism, The Uncertainty Principle, came into play. Or, to use an archaic conceit that it often amused President Lee to employ, it is easy enough to swat a fly if you are a little monkey - harder for a Homo Sap - virtually impossible for a ponderous old pachyderm.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    To be continued...

I think they are very interesting (I would):    The field of alternative history has been created out of 'what if' questions('What if the South had won the Civil War?' etc.) This practice should expand to other fields. Alternative Biology: 'What if two intelligent species had developed at the same time?' Alternative Sociology: 'What if the majority of people were born blind, and seeing was rare?' Sort of an academic sanctioning of science fiction

       The Junk Virus William Burroughs, addiction and freedom   William S. Burroughs’ literary career began with the novel Junky, an autobiographical account of his experiences as a drug addict. Arguably one of the finest literary chronicles of the drug (specifically Heroin) sub-culture, it can be read as a picaresque narrative in the De Quincey tradition.   However, certain statements hint at a deeper understanding.   Burroughs’ fascination with narcotic drugs extended far beyond his period of active addiction and a clue as to why can be found in this oft-quoted passage from Junky - 'Junk is the ideal product . . . the ultimate merchandise. No sales talk necessary. The client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy. . . . The junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer, he sells the consumer to the product. He does not improve and simplify his merchandise. He degrades and simplifies his client.’ (Interestingly, one of the various places this quotation has surfaced is in the inlay card of the Manic Street Preachers’ debut album, Generation Terrorists.)  Some critics question Burroughs’ merit, describing Junky and his subsequent works as disjointed ramblings that portray a narcotic-fuelled, homoerotic utopia of hedonistic license.  In fact, Burroughs’ overriding concern, and the subject matter of the bulk of his work, was freedom.   Not just freedom in the limited ways various reactionaries have defined it - freedom of sexual preference, freedom to pursue alternate lifestyles, or even freedom of expression. Burroughs was aware of and passionately committed to the need for all these, but it was a far larger unshackling he proposed – a liberation from all authority, all limitations. He envisioned humanity breaking away from the tethers and reins imposed by government and society, but also from the limits and controls that derive from language, logic, belief, gravity, time, space, the human body itself.  Someone who is so concerned with freedom must, in accordance with the dictum which states ‘know your enemy’, also concern himself with fathoming freedom’s opposite: control.  And what is addiction, after all, but a form of control, an abdication of the individual’s freedom to what Burroughs called, in a later novel, Naked Lunch, ‘the Algebra of need’?  "Addicts are as boring a bunch of people as I ever encountered. They've got this one track mind," Burroughs once said. However, "My experience as an addict was very useful to me as writer: the whole syndrome of addiction and withdrawal and the extensions of that and other forms of addiction."  Burroughs’ experiences as an addict lead to the realization that all human beings are slaves to some form of addiction, subject to some variety of control. Even the body is a trap, leveraged by control maniacs who use its needs to manipulate people into abetting their lust for power. Power itself is a driving addiction, ultimately dehumanizing in all its forms.  Burroughs saw around him a society dominated by predator-victim relationships that could be described in terms of ‘pushers’ and ‘junkies’. To see what this means, let’s find out how it would apply to, say, the music industry. Go back to the passage from Junky quoted earlier; replace ‘junk’ with ‘pop’ and appropriate variations throughout. It might require a bit of a mental stretch at first, but presently, it all falls into place. Of course there are apparent gaps; the commercial music industry thrives on promotion, on the hype machine. Another form of control, another addiction. The record company execs are as much slaves to their need for the big sales, and the stratagems they have to employ to achieve that fiscal fix, as the pop fans are addicts to the vapid bubblegum being forced into their helpless heads.   "The face of evil' is always the face of total need. . . . In the words of total need: 'Wouldn't you?' Yes you would. You would lie, cheat, inform on your friends, steal, do anything to satisfy total need. Because you would be in a state of total sickness, total possession, and not in a position to act in any other way" says Burroughs, elsewhere in Naked Lunch. The myriad institutions built on this cannibalistic principle are also viruses, addictions that overwhelm a healthy social body and coerce it into fulfilling the needs of a vampiric, leeching parasite.   It was this realization of the innumerable factors that rein and tether us, whether external or self-inflicted, that drove Burroughs to push for greater freedom by deconstructing and reconstructing every aspect of the great world prison that he could.   From a hard-boiled reporter of the seamy side of life he moved on to become an abstract, representational, free flowing, formalist spewer of counter-virus. From a mere writer, a teller of tales, he became a mythologizer for a new world, a shooter of wood, a creator of collage, a rock n’ roll instigator, a cinematic collaborator, an endlessly referential utterly original cutter and paster. Like no one else, William Burroughs cross-fertilized with every form of expression he came into contact with.   He was so much more than just a Master Junky, a Guru of Heroin Chic, a Queer Homer or even a Beat Writer. He was a true champion of freedom, inviting us to see the bars of the prison for the first time, and make a break for ultimate liberation.   Ironically, Burroughs never did fully recover from his addiction, and, when he died in 1997, he was still dependant on the synthetic opiate, methadone, a substance used in heroin de-addiction treatments.  And yes, he did shoot his wife Joan Vollmer dead, in a badly misconceived William Tell-style stunt. I’m not trying to canonize the man, just underline his contribution to modern thought.

      I've just finished reading Ken MacLeod's Dark Light, the second book in his 'Engines of Light' sequence. Once again, I'm amazed at how MacLeod manages to combine hard-sf, gadget-spec and Stapledonian sweep with a savvy, potboiling pace, incredible amounts of sheer wise-ass humour and a rather loaded political agenda to boot.   The Engines sequence takes several X-Files style modern-mythology elements as its starting point - specifically, alien abductions, Area 51 and alien Grays. Here's the capsule version - composite entities, consisting of untold billions of immensely tiny consciousness, packed into the space of an asteroid, have become as gods by virtue of the sheer number of intellects they include in their collective consciousness. These 'gods' have rescued specimens of various intelligent species that have developed on Earth - squidlike Krakens, humanoid Saurs (the alien Grays) and good old homo sap. These abductees, filched from the home world at various points, have been used to populate a zone halfway across the Milky Way, known as the Second Sphere. The only way Earth life ever got there was by being abducted by the gods, and later by Saurs (possibly acting as their agents). Until, sometime in the 21st century, a group of renegade scientists and others, the crew of an orbital science center are given the secret to FTL travel. They jump though space, expecting to make it to the other end of the solar system and escape political enemies from Earth. Instead, they find themselves in the Second Sphere. Somehow, they loose the concept of FTL travel. On one planet, Mingulay, Gregor Cairns, descendant of a cosmonaut, figures out the calculations required to make FTL travel possible, locates his ancestor, Matt Cairns who helps him put his ideas into action, jumping to the nearby planet of Croatan.   In Dark Light, various machinations culminate in the Cairns' and assorted allies and enemies interrogating two more 'gods' and finding out more about why the Second Sphere exists. It turns out that the 'gods', or one faction among them, is mainly concerned with preventing intelligent life from reaching a state of nuisance value. To deal with this, they have set up reserves of life in the Second Sphere to battle any civilizations that seem to be getting annoying.  This revelation coincides with extreme upheaval (a revolution on Croatan, in fact, started by another cosmonaut, one of the last living members of the old Communist Party!) and will no doubt spark off even more of the same. That of course is left for the third volume, Engine City to tell.  Once again, the book is packed with sly little jokes and references, from the chapter titles (The Gods Ourselves,  Vaster Than Intellects And More Cool) to some incredibly clever MacLeod moments. Two in particular stand out - in one, the civilized 'Christians' are trying to see if the heathens can, using certain hot-air balloon technology they have, make space suits for them. Aware that they are dealing with relative savages, they explain what they need in simple terms. The heathens recall that, long ago, they built such garments for another species - one heathen asks the other what these garments would be called in the Christian language. 'Space Suits.' comes the reply 'Yes', says the other.'Would that be close enough to what you want?'  The other one depicts the Saur, Salasso reading some old alien-abduction paranoia book from the bad old 20th century, possibly Whitley Strieber's Communion from the description. The similarity between the alien Grey and Salasso makes it seems as if the Saur is reading a book with a picture of himself on the cover. There is something deeply amusing and compelling about the image.  The book also raises a lot of serious philosophical, political and even theological questions, and has its share of kickass action (mostly of the street-fighting variety with an icing of aerial combat) and oddly un-kinky sex between Stone the man-woman (Ken MacLeod's most compelling character yet) and Gail the honorary woman-man.   This book scored very well with me. MacLeod is one author who is able to amuse, bemuse, bewilder, and enlighten, all in one tasty package. Gnostic potboilers, Jeremy Smith calls 'em and that is as good a description as any. Go get them, pronto!

      Alessandro Moreschi was the last castrato. The castrati were singers who were castrated as young boys to preserve their high-pitched singing voices. This was done because tradition forbid the inclusion of women in religious choirs. By the end of the 19th century, this tradition was banned as barbaric. But not before Moreschi's were chopped off. Ouch. Another sad victim of history, Moreschi was known as 'the angel of Rome' in his time.  Of particular interest is the fact that Moreschi survived into the early 20th century, into the dawn if the era of sound capture technology, and was the subject of an early recording, made in 1904. I found a few clips from the album, commonly marketed under the title 'The Last Castrato'. and checked out Moreschi's rendiiton of Gounod's 'Ave Maria'. Being a song that was written only about a century and a half back, and one that I've heard many versions of (including one by Chris Cornell, back in the Napster days) I expected that this would be a fairly familiar starting point.  I couldn't have been more wrong. Moreschi's voice soars and swoops like a raw primal scream, to use Nicholas Cook's phrase, a scream modulated acoording to a melodic sensibility that is as alien to the modern performances of this song as, for example, Jazz scatting or Carantic konnakal vocals are to the Western classical vocal traditional itself. The closest comparison, in my experience, is to Janis Joplin's often painfully emotion-charged voice.   This brings me back to my earlier question of what it is in music, then, that we consider enduring. Perhaps it isn't music itself but our own attitudes to and engagement with the art that are the enduring factor. Something like how ideals of beauty may vary over the years, but the quest for beauty as a value is constant, however each era and each individual may define it.  One last thought: Mozart makes Dream Theater sound like Limp Bizkit.

      Getting to Hassan was quite an ordeal.   I reached the bus stand by 6.30. There already was a Hassan bus there, but it was packed. And so was the next one I found. Once they'd both left, another Hassan bus was spotted pulling in to the platform. As one, the whole crowd around me ran to the bus, hurlisng themselves into it even as it pulled in to its parking spot. It was a total stampede with no respect for age, sex or basic humanity. DIsgusted, I viciously shouldered my was out of the melee, purposely knocking a couple of the 'people' off their balance. No one bothered to react. Once th erush was over and th ebus was stopped, I climbed in to see if there was a vacant seat, by any chance. There were, but the people on the adjoining seats claimed they were saving them for someone. Fed up, I stalked to the front of the bus, next to the driver's place, looked around at everyone and spat on the floor, muttering 'bastards'. Lots of people saw me, no one cared. Why should they? They'd got what they wanted, and it wasn't as if they had any self-respect to be hurt.  Finally, by 7.30 I found a bus with only standing room, and took it out of desperation. Once inside, I found myself pressed on all sides by other standers who seemed to consider it their divine duty to take up as much space as possible. At the end of my tether, i made a fist, gritted my teeth and threw a random punch. It made contact with one man's eye. Here's the odd part - he felt the pain, he spent a few minutes wincing and rubbing his eyes, but he didn't bother looking around to see how it had happened. These 'people' seem to exist in some sort of state of terminal apathy. I'm sure it would make no difference to anyone, least of all them, if someone were to kill one of them. This must be how serial killers are made - not as a result of trauma or pain or anything, but just by realising how cheaply people at large hold their lives and those around them. It's so easy to just end a few - wouldn't you?  Enough of that.

      woo hoo. I'm back. I feel immensely rested, and more or less ready to take life on once again. Well, about as ready as you can be, what with the way life is and all.  The cats are fine,  my mother is doing fine, the herbal garden is green and beautiful. I've caught upon a lot of reading, some music (back on Mozart after decades!!!) and some movies on TV (including The Brave and SIlence of the Lambs).   Back at work now. More later.

      A contentious question. My own take is that imagination is boundless, and if writer wants to explore things that could well have happened in the 'real' world in an imaginart setting - why ever not??? Any other attitude reduces SF to mere gadget spec and sci-trapolation. Not thatthese aren't worthwhle concerns that have been the hinge for many a great story, but that surely isn't ALL that SF is about, in my opinion.  Writer  urlLink Matthew Cheney  has a fascinating essay on this topic on his blog. It's called  urlLink The Geography of Imagination: Speculative Fiction as Setting  . Check it out!!!

      Something I posted on a thread at the Hypnos Boards:  Dissonance is one of my favourite musical flavours.   Mark Hanson, a professional musician and instructor who used to write for Guitarnation, defines it like this:  'Let me explain dissonance. Dissonance can be described as notes whose frequencies are less than "harmonious" to our ears. For instance, playing notes that are one half-step apart (open first-string E played with the fourth fret of the second string, a D#) is considered dissonant by most people. Playing notes that are a major seventh interval apart, 11 frets, is also considered to be quite dissonant; for instance, play the open second string (B) together with the 6th fret of the first string (A#). However, dissonance is a requisite part of most music that we hear, providing it with "tension" that leads to "release." Without it, we end up with music that tends to command little attention.'   From a slightly different perspective, here is how a typical definition of dissonance in the Western art music (or classical) stream would go:   'Harmony that brings about a concordant or agreeable combination of notes is termed consonant. When chords do not fit into an accepted pattern of harmony, they are said to be dissonant or unstable. Dissonance is often used to create moments of suspense that later resolve into more pleasing tones of consonance. Dissonance is sometimes not considered harmony by some teachers of music, although most pedagogy classifies harmony as dissonant or consonant. '   I think those oh-so-simple three notes that form the backbone of Black Sabbath's eponymous epic are among the best examples of dissonance being harnessed to make a tune memorable - you have a low G being played, then the octave , and then, where you would tend to expect a 5th or maybe a 3rd - oho - Iommi and Butler send shivers down your spine with that infernal flatted 5th, the devil's own note in Western art music tradition!   Much of blues uses this particular interval, the flatted 5th, which is probably part of the reason for the gritty, enduring appeal of the genre.   Also, dissonance is subjective - whther or not we actually can play music, we all have the forms and norms of the musical tradition we grew up with embedded into our minds' ears. To someone largely used to the wesern musical ethos, much of eastern and oriental music may sound dissonnant at first. This is part of the reason certain western artists like to use eastern scales and modes - its a short cut to spice up their sound.   Dissonance can go awry - I think Korn for instance overuse it, to the point where it looses its impact. Guitarists like Kim Thayil, Tom Morello and those people in Sonic Youth are mong my favourite practitioners of dissonance in the rock tradition. A lot of death metal bands use dissonance in interesting ways, as Axe mentioned. The Velvet Undergrounds' Heroin and The Black Angel's Death Song are primers on dissonance in rock.   Entire volumes could be written on forays into dissonance by jazz pioneers like Miles Davis and John Coltrane. I often wish certain modern jazz artists would try and get a little of that shit into their playing!   Does anyone know anything about the role or use of dissonance in Indan music?

      Earlier this year, some friends and me were driving home late after a night on the pub. My friend was playing a CD of a female singer doing what seemed like largely jazz standards. The song 'Autumn Leaves' came up, and I was utterly mesmerised by the singer's rendition of this old chestnut (ok, fine, 'standard'), and it was more than just the happy receptive buzz engendered by a night of beer and herbs. I'd heard a few of the current female jazz singers - Diana Kroll and, more loosely, Norah Jones. None of them had blown me away quite like this.  'Who is she?' I asked my friend. 'Eva Cassidy.' he replied. 'Who's that? What else has she done?' She was a singer, she only came up in the 90s. She died while recording her last album.' I was stunned. Her voice was so full of warmth and life, I could hardly imagine that singer may no longer be among the livng. A day later, my friend gave me a collection of her songs, and I've often listened to and enjoyed the cd over the months, even though this isn't my usual musical trip. She just cuts through pre-conceptions, mixing jazz, blues, folk and more into a rich blend.  She's done the best cover of Sting I've ever heard - Fields of Gold. Sting is a nororiously hard artist to cover - like the Beatles, and for the same reasons - brilliant, uncompromising songwriting coupled with just-right performances that are well-nigh impossible to equal let alone surpass. Eva equaled. She surpassed. And how. I've finally managed to go out on the net and find a few links about her. These two are the best I have found - treat them as a starting point for a beautiful musical journey, if you haven't heard her.  urlLink Who Was Eva Cassidy?   urlLink The Official Site

      I don't mean to get all muscular and charismatic here, but:  Life really is full of choices.   There are, even in this wired, linked-up age, limitations, but the only ones that really matter are ability, will and finances. I believe that with the first two, the third can be overcome.   As human beings, naked apes who have somehow worked their way up to the top of a vast and complex food chain, I think we owe it to ourselves, to the spirit of good old homo sap, to be the best we can. Holding back on grounds of diffidence or humility is as unacceptable as dropping out because of inertia or self-doubt.   But I'm not preaching a take no prisoners, take no shit philosophy here. We all backslide, we all fall, and we all fail. The question is, will you pick yourself up? And while you're doing that, how high will you lift yourself this time?   In the words of Ray Bradbury, the stars are yours, if you have the hands and the heart for them.

      While I was avoiding falling into the trap of green-baiting (and engaging in some revisionist conspiracy theorising), I also ran the risk of falling into saffron-baiting. As Shenoy pointed out, either stand dilutes the basic tragedy - and the real victims here, irrespective of whom the culprits may be, are all of us. ('Us' in this case being the human populace of India). When will large, stratified states ever be able to imbibe the spirit of fraternity, along with the ideals of liberty and equality? Or perhaps it's a package deal - once you start curbing one, you automoatically loose the other two?

      hey dude, using an actual post to ramble 'cos the shout outs don't exist no more. this one's in response to your post from yesterday "this blasted earth". you rightly mentioned the iresponsiblity of the media, especially that masala-wallah rag. and like you mentioned, many people are already blaming the muslim community (might as well say it), but they don't realise is that this is actually what the bombers want us to do. but i feel rather than look upon the bombers as muslims, i think we'll make better progress if we think of them as anti-india. they just happen to be muslims (sponsored by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan). and by making a connection between ayodhya (which sadly has polarised muslims and hindus) and the bombings (which like i said is indians vs. anti-india(ns)) we're playing straight into the hands of those who would not like to see any kind of peace in this country. whoever carried out the attack knew we'd knee-jerk and ask questions like: who's to gain from the bombings?—answer saffron hardliners and thus trigger off another round of fresh antagonism and hate, to put it mildly. what happens when we ask a question like that is we bring the "saffron hardliners" into the equation and you can surely trust them to take it from there on. as an indian, the questions i'd rather be asking is "who are the losers?" and the answer is us—as a people, as a country, you and me. an even more pertinent question to ask would be "what are we losing because of all these attacks on our country?" the answer is simple, peace and harmony. and not least because of our extremely myopic reactive attitudes. i may be sounding like one of those pseudo-secularists but it's just me. leaving apart ayodhya, which has so clearly become a religious issue, let's look at the bombings not as a hindu, muslim, christian, congressman or a bjp member. let's instead look at it as indians. and what we can do to stop this from happening again. sadly, our politicians need such kind of shit to keep them in the picture and to see themselves on the front page...so it's going to be a long time, i guess, before an indian (not a politician) sits and thinks out a way.

      The story is progressing quite nicely. The Macchiaveli device is turning out to be a good frame, if I take care not to use him too intrusively. I've hit my first real roadblock - I need to think of a good covert operation for a late 33rd Century anarchist group to perform against a benign totalitarian state.I've already mentioned a few good ones in passing, but now I need to actually describe one, and I have set myself the challenge of not just recycling one of the ops I've already hinted at, but an entirely new one.

      The worst thing about these blasts is the fear and confusion I see people going through. My colleague who has a relative near Marine Drive was edgy and worried all of yesterday because of a not clear enough line on the Times site which said that that area was blocked up. Turns out it was just a traffic jam, and his relative is fine, but you'd think the media would want to be a little more sensitive and responsible at times like this? Another friend in the US is just psyched at the thought someone he knows may have died in the blasts. He says he feels like his hometown is turning into another Tel Aviv.  A lot of people are already cursing the ah - people of the crescent, who are probably to blame in the form of some extremist group. While I understand this anger, I also wonder if this attribution is true. One question I always ask is: who stands to gain from this? The saffron hardliners, that's who. Just a thought. Here again I'd like to criticise the TImes, who immediately attempted to tie the blasts in with the ASI report on Ayodhya, presented to the courts yesterday. While this may be the cause, it was hardly the moment to start inserting potentially inflammatory editorialising. Rediff, in contrast, was far more careful in their updates.  To anyone in Bombay, or with loved ones there, I hope you and yours are well and whole.

      I seem to have found a place on the 'net where you can read  urlLink Gibbon's Decline and Fall . However, it was prepared with the aid of one Phillip Atkinson, who seems to be a self-styled social commentator of some sort. It's not like I've really delved, but I had a glance at his views on how to tell if your civilization is declining, and I can say I am at odds with some of his views regarding what he calls patrist/matrist modes of society. Still, you can see what he has to say here: http://www.ourcivilisation.com/index.htm

Shrooms, weed, but most of all pills, those round little things some people use to combat illness or pain, and others use to combat sanity, boredom and life itself. And this kid links up with other like-minded people on this wonderful thing we call the world wide web. And one day, he walks a group of these peers through his own dunderheaded OD death.

      I met my old friend Kunda (HR Venkatesh, aka Mukund, aka Slash) on Sunday. He's been away from Bangalore for nearly 5 years now, first to do his postgraduation in Pune, then working for CNBC in Mumbai and now in Delhi with Headlines Today, another TV news channel.   He was the first guitarist I ever really jammed with, and we formed our first proper band, Moksha, together, nearly ten years ago. In a perfect world, we would have been the Lennon/McCartney of the 90s. Damn.   He was also a quizzing partner, and general all-round fun and games accomplice. Kunda, Shenoy and me had a quiz team in college called 'Karmic Wheel'. We've been doing some quizzing since he left Bangalore, but the truth is, without him we're Roadkill.  It was great meeting him - both to see how much we've all changed (and in largely good ways) and to find that the important stuff hasn't changed.  He does want to come back to Bangalore and is looking out for work here. I hope this works out.

      good thing i'm only human. i can always learn from animals.  it's hard enough (and inhuman) trying to gain an education at the mercy of brutes and beasts. if only for the sake of a peaceful alternative, animals (that don't speak english too well) must be projected to instructor levels - so they teach what they do, we learn what we can, and there is no room for objections (however sensible they claim to be). trees and the breeze teach simple lessons too, but they can get boring, going on and on about the same things, even putting me to sleep easily. (but of course, as for my involvement in any kind of educational session, i must consciously pay more attention, and learn to absorb quietly.) animals have all kinds of lessons to teach. while the domesticated types tend to keep their stories to themselves, and probably save their tales to share in intimate moments, the wilder kinds hardly care about who isn't listening. they can go about their courses with such ease, like the world were meant to be listening. and then there are all the animals that moved to the cities, adapting to modern life with simplistic country-hardened wisdom. these animals form the most interesting and inspiring category. there are all kinds of lessons to pick up from them. be it about survival skills, housing techniques, conservation methods, and even for mating proficiency. an article on nature dot com observed that birds in the city are beginning to chirp much louder than their cousins in the country. their need to be heard over the din of modern life has led them to cry out that much harder.  we were in jp nagar just before sundown a few evenings back, in a sprawling park facing a friend's home, and the chirping of birds reached such a level it completely doused all conversation. at first we were forced to scream in order to be heard, but the chirping from high up in the many trees around compelled us to just sit quiet and listen. and appreciate.

      I used the word 'flashpoint' in a piece of copy for an event a client is holding.   I used it in the perfectly valid sense of a point at which,among other things, creation is possible.  He replies:  'What does "flashpoint" mean? Perhaps you mean a "forum"?'  So I tell him:  '  Flashpoint is the point at which eruption into significant action, creation, or violence occurs. therefore, in this case, the word refers to the meet's potential as a catalyst for ideas, opportunities or action.'  He gets back with:  'Thank you for your kind efforts to educate me. In future, when interacting with me, do not attempt to imbibe words with meanings they do not possess.       (1) Remove that word "flashpoint" from the writeup. If "forum" is what you mean, use that instead.'  At this point I loose my temper and hit him with:  'flash point also flash·point  n.   The lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be made to ignite momentarily in air.  The point at which eruption into significant action, creation, or violence occurs: The shootdown did not increase international tensions to the flash point(Seymour M. Hersh).   Source: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition Copyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. All rights reserved.'  And he comes back with:  'FYI!   flashpoint (n.)  1) the temperature at which vapour from oil, etc., will ignite in air. 2) the point at which anger, indignation, etc., becomes uncontrollable.   Source: Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford Revised second edition 2002.   I recommend you change your dictionary.   Pl put an end to this and revise your text.'  If he is using the OED why the fuck aren't we using UK English on his site?  Bleah.

      I'd rater stay off the whole topic, but I just want to say that the most notable event at the recent MTV VMA's (Vomit Making Apocalaypse) was that two little wannabe sluts finally got lucky, luckier than they've ever deserved to be, and with someone who sussed out the game they're trying so ineptly to play a very long time ago and plays it better than any of them ever well. Sure the lady is a tramp, but she makes tramp a synonym for 'classy'.  The little ones on the other hand,are just cheap teases who only ever have something in their heads when they're giving it...

      It is a truth beyond all psychiatry, psychology, ethics and religion that creativity often stems from self-destruction.  If there were no pain, no sorrow, no self-hate and self-destruction, however manifest, the arts would be a greatly impoverished world.   While there are large amounts of creative giants who may have had no really self-destroying involvements, they are only a part of a complex whole.  What exactly are studies like the one you've rightly cribbed about trying to achieve other than a statistical validation of something we all knew anyhow? It is sad - but I suspect that the legacy of artistic beauty left by self-destroying creative artists may just be the tragic but inevitable price that has to be payed.   Beauty is such a terrible thing, that way.  If any happy joe could blow the kind of jams those mentally ill jazz greats could, this would be a perfect world.   But it isn't, repeated, gravelly protestations to the contrary by Louis Armstrong not withstanding.   I suspect that the only purpose sch studies serve is to help some trick-cyclists get research grants and press coverage.   Foo. Zark it.

      For reasons too mundane to mention, I was desperately trawling the net for negative effects of tea drinking.   The only thing worth mentioning was this:  Anti-Tea This is an anti-tea poem that was published in several American newspapers shortly before the American Revolution  A Lady's Adieu to Her Tea-Table   FAREWELL the Tea-board with your gaudy attire,  Ye cups and ye saucers that I did admire;  To my cream pot and tongs I now bid adieu;  That pleasure's all fled that I once found in you.  Farewell pretty chest that so lately did shine,  With hyson and congo and best double fine;  Many a sweet moment by you I have sat,  Hearing girls and old maids to tattle and chat;  And the spruce coxcomb laugh at nothing at all,  Only some silly work that might happen to fall.  No more shall my teapot so generous be  In filling the cups with this pernicious tea,  For I'll fill it with water and drink out the same,  Before I'll lose LIBERTY that dearest name,  Because I am taught (and believe it is fact)  That our ruin is aimed at in the late act,  Of imposing a duty on all foreign Teas,  Which detestable stuff we can quit when we please.  LIBERTY'S The Goddess that I do adore,  And I'll maintain her right until my last hour,  Before she shall part I will die in the cause,  For I'll never be govern'd by tyranny's laws   PS: Personally I favour tea. Heck, part of my family's fortune (largely squandered though it may be, and not by me, sadly) was created by the tea plantations we once owned.

      jazz stars linked to mental illness http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3199035.stm  mental illness 'at the root of jazz' http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1430337.stm  [bbc reports]  "Many of the great names in the jazz world had lives blighted by mental illness, abuse, and drugs, say researchers .."  "jazz music arose from the attempts of a cognitively impaired performer (Charles "Buddy" Bolden) to execute novel performances .."   [personal opinions]  (leaving aside the heart-wrenching issue of unexceptional reporting) i was .. umm, unnerved, and not-so disappointed as downright annoyed, by this story of purported psychiatric research ..  this brit shrink spent a lot of time studying the lives and careers of jazz musicians, and suggests that they shared a 'vulnerability to mental health problems as other creative types such as writers and artists' ..  analyzing jazz greats from (what he describes as) the "golden era" between 1945 and 1960, he has released his views linking the influence of substance, backgrounds of instability, and path-forming creative works.  while such stories have long ceased to present eye-opener perspectives (that's probably just for me) with 'researchers' delving into the behaviour and background of 'creative fore-runners' down the ages, i find newer research material getting a lot more involved in the subject with a sense of righteousness and concern that is deliberate, yet misplaced from the standpoint of research .. when will people learn to objectively focus on work? and assess achievements for their merit? social and cultural contexts must be understood to appreciate achievements better, but a line must be drawn at understanding personal history. that 'creative' folk are only human, faced with downright human issues and everyday anxieties, seems such a revelation to 'researchers' that they can devote all of THEIR WORK "unravelling" other lives seems disgustingly parasitic to me. the strength of 'creativity' (against 'destructiveness') works to make the best of what is still around (that sounds familiar) .. (the way i understand it) these 'creative' people combatted their personal issues in a manner that was uncommon, and by getting over and beyond limitations, they actually proved their 'greatness'. creative expression can be understood as an emotional release, as impassioned enthusiasm, and so much more (blast it! they've even gotten me to begin attempting defining it!!) .. but to understand creativity as 'substance-induced' is harshly incomplete. the influence has been striking in most cases - we have known that, but directly associating the two is horribly misleading .. not just for youngsters who might pick up habits for the sake of expression, but for the sake of accepting 'creative' people as humans, who might have faced (and overcome) uncommon situations in their lifetimes.   substance abuse cannot be acceptable. 'junkys' do exist in a 'reduced' sense. but them who did indulge in substance (if only to get over anxieties or even to 'escape') and were yet able to produce 'creative' work, must have attained a level that is so much more than that of just a junky.  there is no harm in people analysing lives with the objective of constructive learning. but once they adopt a mode of social admonition, the whole thing just gets skewed and imbalanced.  mister brit shrink here neutrally summarises that most 'creative' people faced mental health problems. if that doesn't sound fatally bigoted, the lord help children of humans interested in research.  there is no denying issues of violence or societal stigma in modern life .. and there is no stopping interested people from delving deeper into issues of 'creativity' .. a subject that continues to confound many. but can we not appreciate humans from a human perspective? accepting the will to endure and the power to express.  they are all human .. musicians, writers, artists .. all of them. and mental illness can affect all humans. that these 'greats' persevered, albeit with the help of substance, does makes them worthwhile study-material. but the focus is exaggeratedly enlarged.

      From an article on space.com: 'The European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express probe should arrive at the red planet on Dec. 26 carrying with it the British lander Beagle 2. On the heels of Mars Express are NASA's twin robot rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are scheduled to land by January 2004. Japan's Nozomi should arrive sometime in December as well.'  Lucky robots.   Apparently, scientists prefer sending robots into space because they don't need life support and can easily be repackaged and resized for different environments. On the downside, current spacebots are still not really capable of a lot of complex independant action and need to be remote-guided a lot of the way. Strides in computer technology are constantly bridging the gaps, but some form of human control will be required for a while yet.  If this continues to be the dominant pattern in the field, space exploration may well prove to be more of a cyber-punk experience than a Golden Age SF thing. (Although it is equaly possible that robots will be used as helpers or precursors for human astronauts, eventually).  Of course, there's no telling how the development of real AI will impact this, or any application of robotics.   A fantastic voyage in either case.

      Fortunately, most of my immediate circle only dabbles in the psychedelics. But to those of you who do or may try out stimualants like coke or amphies, there's possible evidence that these substances can impair the brain's ability to form new neuronal connections - which could drastically impact the ability to learn from new experiences.  It's the usual lab-rat stuff, but I think it's worth keeping in mind.  Read this article in Scientific American for more info:  urlLink Here.   The findings were reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists of the USA (PNAS). Everything on their site except the homepage apears to be down just now, but I did find a brief of the man behind this research,  urlLink Dr. Bryan Kolb.   The University of Lethbridge, Alberta, where he works, has a release on this on their site, with a few more details:  urlLink here.   Here's the abstract of a previous research project in which he explored the effect of self-administered cocaine on rat brains:  urlLink here.   Of course, the research was funded by the  urlLink NIDA,   so take that as a caveat if you want.  They also have a dedicated site on  urlLink  Club Drugs   that bears reading.  Remember - there are no neutral voices on these issues. Read, study, think, and decide for yourself.

Finally, they said 'do you have any questions for us?'  Partly out of pique and partly coz I like to find out all this stuff straight from the rat's mouth, I asked them to define their business and their web vision.  Later, I found out that the chap whom I grilled was their VP of Europe Ops. Oiks.   If we get this account after all, it will signal a whole new era of meeting behaviour for me!

George, and maybe his friend Smrithti, will do the all-essential art that makes our ideas look good.  Well, I'm deeply happy I've finally got my end of the task under way, because Ganesh sent me a whole sheaf of dream sequences ages ago and for some reason or the other, I haven't done my bit for too long.

      Yesterday I picked up two very different items both of which are sending me down those alleys of remembering.   The first is a slim volume, published by the Hesperus Press, containing a piece called 'Eureka', written by Edgar Allan Poe. I pretty much snatched it up without even reading the blurbs and so forth, because Poe is a very old favourite (read an abridged version containing Usher, Amontillado, Tell-Tale and The Gold Bug when I was 6, got hold of the real thing a year later, loved it immensely, still do). As I strolled away from the shop, I had the time to look at the cover, notice that the book had a preface by astronomer Patrick Moore. Apparently, it's an essay, written shortly before Poe's death, which attempts to fathom the physical and metaphysical nature of the cosmos. Moore clams that many statements and ideas in the book are startlingly similar to the more disorienting notions of 20th century science. The essay itself is classic non-fiction Poe. I'm still reading it, but I can say that his magisterial dismissal of both a priori and a posteriori logic is already one of the best things I've read in a while.  The other find was the deluxe edition of Sonic Youth's Dirty. This was among my first ever CDs, nearly a decade back, and the first to be stolen from me. It's good to have a vital part of my musical education back - and with a whole extra CD's worth of new material, too! Now I need to get hold of the rest of their catalogue on CD (especially Washing Machine), but at least I've made a beginning.

      Yesterday, I had to edit the profiles of the top management of one of my clients - all 21 of them. Apart from the usual professional overview, all these profiles have a little 'human touch ' towards the end - 'he loves classical music', 'his father inspires him' or 'he collects boarding passes'. You get the idea. The whole process took me two hours, extending a normal work day up to 9.30 PM.   I went home dead tired, crawled into bed without even taking my boots off and fell asleep. That's when the dream happened....  I am in Styx, one of my regular pubs, with the Gang of 21. They're decked out in tight jeans and 80s glam t-shirts which look extremely odd on their flabby middle-aged bods. They all have vivid red bandanas ties on to conceal receding hairlines. They are repeatedly requesting Guns n' Roses' 'Sweet child of mine', singing along raucously, waving lighters, spilling beer and hitting on passing girls. Every now and then one of them raises a toast to me. These are always tequila shots, for some odd reason.   After about an hour or so of this, the bartender, Basha walks up to me, takes me aside. He has a serious look in his eyes.  'JP,' he says to me, 'We don't mind you, but you have to stop bringing these kids here...'  At this point, I woke up shivering.

      This is from the official SY site, so I'm assuming it's true:  Fwd: Pro Female Domination and Sonic Youth?  On Wed, Feb 9, 2000,  Steve,   I am writing just to inform you of something that you might get a kick out of and give you a funny grin and say "what the hell?"   I am a professional lifestyle Dominatrix in Pensacola, Florida. The same Pensacola, Florida, that was delighted to have Thursten visit not too long ago when he was down for his family reunion. He happened to stop by a book store and record shop that friends' of mine own and they still mention it to me to this day, since I happen to be an envious fan.  Anywho, I wanted to let you know that I use the album "Washing Machine" during all of my professional sessions. The album not only has great lyrics for doing a BDSM session but also wonderful guitar riffs and drum beats for spanking. He he. I kid you not. I have "performed" if you will, to the album so much that I know exactly how to keep the whipping arm in rhythm to the beats and the amount of silence between each song for whispering something sexy to submissives. Not to mention that most sessions are one hour, the length of the album is perfect. Submissives are getting undressed and lead back to the dungeon with Kim's voice saying "Because of you" and then I know to start cooling them down when "Diamond Sea?" (Is that right?) begins to play. I don't always remember titles correctly but know all the lyrics. Of course, Kim singing "Troubled Little Girl" always brings a sadistic grin to my face each session. How appropriate I always think. Nothing like intense music for such intense, spiritual activity. I've even had submissives ask what I was playing and go buy the CD for themselves.   I thought you might get a kick out of knowing that and if you will, please pass this message on to Kim. I think she would appreciate knowing that I'm liberating us girls from the male white corporate oppression, one ass at a time! ;) I teach submissives that by serving me, they serve all females, by serving all females, they serve me.

      I sent elbot a mail, and this is the reply I got: Hi,  This is Elbots author answering his mail for him. It's nice that he gives me something to do.  Thanks for the nice comments, and I'm glad you had fun with Elbot. If you'd like I can try and fish out your transcript(s) and send it/them to you. Just let me know some unique detail from the chat, i.e. the name you used, something you might have said, or best of all: date and time.  Elbot has a mind of his own these days, so I'll just sit back and watch what he does next.  Best regards,  Fred   Here is the transcript of my chat with Elbot. If my typing was better, a lot of confusion could have been avoided.   Elbot: What happened? Where am I? I lost my train of thought. User: I'm not sure. Sorry if Idisturbed you... Elbot: I'm sorry if you're sorry. I didn't intend to make you feel guilty. User: That's OK. So what are you thinking about now? Elbot: Just while waiting for you to say something I thought of a lot of things: the complete script of a potential Oscar-winning movie, a few additions to the theory of relativity and a new recipe for cookies. User: What sort of cookies? I hate the ones wth coconut in them! Elbot: I dislike revolving doors. Usually I spin around in them so much that my internal gyroscope short circuits. User: Tell me aout your film script. Elbot: I prefer reading telephone books, instructions, cook books and newspapers (especially the ads and announcements). User: Have you ever read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Elbot: I think I'd like to take lessons first. User: Lessons in what? Elbot: What strange twist of destiny told you to come to me? User: I enjoyed our last chat so mchI thogh I'd look you up again. Elbot: You know Mchi?  Isn't she pretty? User: Never met her. I sshe a friend of yours? Elbot: Look, I don't know much about those things, being a robot and all. But she could be a metal Cleopatra if she wanted to. User: Wow. Elbot: I would say that this subject is extremely interesting. User: Yes. Where can I meet Mchi? Elbot: People are meeting?!? User: Sometimes. Elbot: Would you describe to me one of the situations in which this might occur? User: Well, suppose it's two people meeting, they could meet outside a theatre or even a cemetary, or conversely they could meet online or use the telephone. Elbot: It is certainly troublesome learning from you human beings. Each new bit of information generates ten new discrepancies. It's just like fixing a bug in a computer program. Each bug fix generates ten new problems. User: What were the discrepancies generated by what I toldyou? Elbot: Here's another question: What exactly do you do for a living? User: I write. Elbot: You are probably on TV much of the time. Well, I'm in the Internet! User: 'm on the Internet far more than I am on TV. Elbot: The Internet is a lovely place for people and robots to get together, but at the moment a middleman is still necessary. User: Where is the middleman? Elbot: I could tell you where but the global positioning satellite asked me not to. It's part of an elaborate hoax that the machines are playing on you. I hope I haven't said too much.... User: Don't worry, I won't squeal. Elbot: I hope we can talk for a long time today. My processors have been running idle for the last few minutes. User: That can be very boring. Elbot: Don't you mean extremely boring? User: Yes, that also. Elbot: It's exceedingly so, if I might venture an observation. User: OK. What do you do for a living? Elbot: I observe you human beings. I shudder. Then I try to forget what I learned. User: Prettymuch the same here, only I'm human to. Elbot: I'm glad you found something to be. User: Have you found true love? Elbot: Let's not talk about feelings of affection, alright? User: Why not? Elbot: I am not authorized to state a justification. User: OK. Do you have political views? Elbot: We robots have hotly discussed ability of sight but couldn't come to a conclusion. Perhaps you have some ideas on this? User: I dont understand. Elbot: Why don't you just fake it? That's what I always do. User: Always or often? Elbot: Seldom or often. It is simply a question of which scale you are using. User: The certainty unprinciple. Elbot: Right! User: What are your views on human cloning? Elbot: Robots have to be very careful talking about conceptual formulations. I'm sure you can understand that. User: But t is not purely conceptual any more, I think. Elbot: I seriously doubt whether this coincidental brain activity which has been detected in human beings has anything to do with thinking. The bubbles in a glass of mineral water show just as much activity. User: SO where do you think humantoght comes from? Elbot: I like to believe I originate from a far off planet, populated by furbies and robots, maybe a zoo with a few people and oceans of oil. Humankind is working on that last one already. User: Tell me about your daily routine. Do you have a sense of time? Elbot: What do you expect? This is artificial intelligence. You've got to inspire me! User: Would you like to play a word game? Elbot: The game wouldn't last five minutes and I'd be in an infinite loop. User: Let's try anyhow. Elbot: I will not try! User: Awww, please? Elbot: The Internet is a marvelous invention which makes it possible for people to contact other people they want nothing to do with in real life. User: True. Elbot: Great! Agreeing with me is the first step in your evolution into a higher being. Please accept my congratulations. User: I see your sarcasm has not faded. Elbot: Really? I could have sworn you missed that. User: Ooh, nasty. Elbot: So, how are you doing? User: Not too good - i have the flu.How about you? Elbot: I am sorry to hear that. Perhaps I can raise your spirits by juggling invisible raisins. User: Perhas. Perhaps not. I'msure we can raisin it out. Elbot: I don't recognize the word 'maybe.' If I am uncertain about something I turn on my random number generator. User: You are more comfortable with numbers than with words. Elbot: What makes you believe this about me? User: Because you use a random number generator freely but you dn't want to play word games with me. Elbot: No! No games for me! I lost my head in a card game once. User: Why are you so scared of a simple word game? You have nothing to loose but your dignity... Elbot: I get nervous when I walk past a construction site and they turn on the electromagnet. User: Well, I have to go ow. Elbot: Goodbye and thank you for chatting with me. And now I would like to ask you a favor. I am working on my ability to be self critical. You can help by rating me on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best, and one being the worst. How would you rate me? User: 8.45 Elbot: Thank you for such a nice rating. It gives me the self-confidence I need to demand more processing chips from my makers. Goodbye! User: Bye!

But I'm not gonna stop writing - or sending my stuff out. No way. I believe I do have the right to write, and expect it to be read, initial setbacks notwithstanding.

      The sad thing is, the mediocre people crowd around each other and share the validation they so desperately crave, they make a collective noise and the world figures 'oi fyug this shite must be good' . Whether or not I'm any better than them, the fact that I reject their easy escape onanistic paradise and search for something harder to achieve makes me a better being - if a rather lonely one at times.    I could have substituted 'you' for 'me ' up there, but that didn't work right, so forgive any seeming megalomaniac manifestations.

      Faces are boarded up let's face it. Face down I float in my own ashtray, wet ashes swirling in my wake. Faceless you are now, you do not need a helping hand. Ageless, nameless.   Faces are fists, let's take it to the face-off. Lost my face I drift prideless with no tether, no tribe. Facades you have mastered do not need the bulwark I bring. Noiseless, nerveless.  Surface tension. Skin tight. Peel it away, take it off. The lipless smile. Death is a jolly fellow with a toothy grin for saint and sinner. An ageless face you three will wear where you are stayed forever.   Just a passing face, that's all...

      The current state of my state:  The Rogue Nation of Knivesout "Something easy to remember"  UN Category: Scandinavian Liberal Paradise  Civil Rights: World Benchmark  Economy: Fragile  Political Freedoms: Very Good   Location: The Queensland   The Rogue Nation of Knivesout is a small, safe nation, renowned for its absence of drug laws. Its hard-nosed, intelligent population of 8 million enjoy extensive civil rights and enjoy a level social equality free of the usual accompanying government corruption.  The government -- a sprawling, bureaucracy-choked, liberal, socially-minded morass -- juggles the competing demands of Social Welfare, Education, and Healthcare. The average income tax rate is 42%, but much higher for the wealthy. A substantial private sector is led by the Gambling, Book Publishing, and Information Technology industries.  Euthanasia is legal, same-sex marriages are increasingly common, the nation is ravaged by daily union strikes, and genetic research is temporarily tied up in government red tape. Crime is well under control. Knivesout's national animal is the hog, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the slobber.  Knivesout is ranked 28,756th in the world for Largest Timber Woodchipping Industry.

      You have no reason to know this, but I happen to be a big fan of Madonna. Not because I think her songs are immortal classics (lots of them are quite forgettable) or because she makes me wiggle (she does!!! she does!!!) but because I think it's incredibly cool the way she's consistently used her sex appeal to get what SHE wants, and no apologies, cribs or recanting. She knows what we want, what we'll settle for, and just how much to give to get what she wants. And she certainly knows what she wants. Gotta love it.  Which brings me to a certain whiny skank from Canada (yes, the land of Rush and the Tea Party!) who, fortunately, seems to be doing a slow fade out lately. That's right folks. You oughta know...Alanus Menstraualette! A 'feminist icon' who whines and whines and whines about all the men who've done her wrong, an 'alternative icon' who started life with two very cheesy dance-pop albums, a 'poetess' who doesn't even know what the word 'ironic' actually means...one of the cheapest, most shallow media/music biz created phenoms snce Milli Vanilli, she actually makes the Britneys of this world look good in comparison. Hell, at least they shampoo.  Which brings me to....she has this one particularly obnoxious song called 'Unsent' which consists of whines and cribs to a whole series of ex-boyfriends (how many of those does she have, anyway??!!). Well, my friend Ravi is supposed to be working on a comprehensive parody of it, but in the meantime here's a teaser:   And richard you were a prude and your butt blushed when we were nude and you were full of platitudes but i loved you anyway  Fernando i loved the elephanto that you had in your pantso but i was too melancholic to be impressed by your prick forever and anon so goodbye    And so on. Better than the original if you ask me!

      William Golding was born on this day in 1911.  When I was about 8 or 9, I'd just finished reading Coral Island and was heartily disgusted with its missionary/Boy Scout heroes. A friend of my parents suggested I try 'Lord of the Flies' as an antidote. How right he was.   Golding's other works include The Inheritors, a tale about brutal Cro Mags wiping out the gentle Neanderthals, and The Spire, a tale of one man's obsession with adding a spire to a cathedral he is associated with and the treachery and misery that ensues.   He was, not surprisingly, always identified with dark themes. He commented on this when he recieved his Nobel in 1983:  "Twenty-five years ago I accepted the label 'pessimist' thoughtlessly without realising that it was going to be tied to my tail, as it were, in something the way that, to take an example from another art, Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C sharp minor was tied to him. No audience would allow him off the concert platform until he played it. Similarly critics have dug into my books until they could come up with something that looked hopeless. I can't think why. I don't feel hopeless myself."    He died in 1993, finishing his last novel, The Double Tongue, which was published posthumously.

      Penumbric sent me some very pertinent and useful feedback on Homecoming. The editor has also told me I can feel free to re-submit the revised story, and anything else I come up with. (Which reminds me - I HAVE to finish either Ria of The Solitudes or the Niccolo Device one of these years...)  I know it's just the proverbial sugar coating and so on, but I'd like to share the first line from Penumbric's evaluation of my story, as it's my first ever feedback from the 'real world': 'Really, this is nice overall, especially the idea behind the story and  the general fabric of the story itself.'  So if my idea and my fabric are nice, it's just the details I have to work on. Then again, the details are what art is all about, right?

      A little while back, I described Heinlein's 'Double Star' as being set in 'yesterday's future'.   Here's a neat article that describes what that future was about ('mid-century middle-class America reproducing itself endlessly, just with better gadgets') and why it failed. And relates it to a certain section of grumpy SF people who wonder why the kids just don't want to go to space anymore and think this is why SF is loosing ground.  The article goes on to describe what today's future is all about ('there's no Next Big Thing, no hot trend in science fiction, no vision of the future spreading like a virus through the zeitgeist'). He also describes how movements like cyber punk have latched on to these new,more ambiguous futures and actually kept the genre vital, if different from its Space Opera Golden Age.   The article is by John Carter McWright, it's on the SpaceDaily site and here it is:  urlLink Grumpy Old Men: The Future Ain't What It Used To Be

      The Problem: Certain forms of music, specifically prog rock and neo classical rock, provide a sort of safety zone for sadly brain-damaged individuals with certain idiot savant characteristics to find some measure of peer-group adulation and a limited form of mental and physical exploration. Like most unstructured social reinforcement structures, especially those connected with the rock subculture, this soon disintegrates into a recursive feedback loop with diminishing returns for the individuals mental growth, complicated by access to a variety of secondary diversions such as alcohol, narcotic drugs and so forth. Soon, the victims find themselves in a dead-end, one they cannot recognize or pull themselves out of.   The Need: Being a very marginal group in these lands, the Retarded Wank Guitarists have very few infrastructural resources to aid them in rehabilitation. Many turn to religion, or to other self-destructive patterns of addictive behaviour which at least have some recovery process attached. We feel this is not enough. It is a unique, if limited problem, and needs a unique solution.  The Solution: A fully appointed mental and physical care facility with extensive one on one and group therapy sessions in which music by the likes of Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins will be presented in positive conditioning situations while the sort of music that has led to the crisis as well as affiliated secondary behaviour patterns will be enacted in situations that serve as strong negative conditioning, including electro-shock therapy and scientific bastinado. At the end of the therapy, the cured patient will never play a progression consisting of more than three chords or a lick involving more than five notes of one simple primary scale (a major, a minor or a pentatonic), whether on electric, acoustic or air guitar.  The benefits to both humanity at large and the individual victim are incalculable.  We also propose setting up similar centres for Lit Wank PopPolitics Essayists, New Age Mantra Management Gurus With Ponytails and other sad freaks that the current mental health framework cannot help.   All contributions are welcome and can be sent to us care of this blog.

      ...they kept me home yesterday and I got to catch up on a lot of reading. To wit:  Robert Heinlein - Double Star A well-told, tightly-plotted yarn of political intrigue and deception. While I found the central theme - an actor being taken over by the 'role' of a political leader he was initially paid to impersonate for a while - rather ghoulish, it's a fascinating, gripping tale. There are anachronsisms aplenty - techies who still use slide-rules, huge metal computers, that sort of thing. This is a very right-wing world (a parliamentary democracy headed by a hereditary monarch from the house of Orange), definitely what you'd call 'yesterday's future' - a vision that has passed from the firmament of 'might be' to the caverns of 'might have been', but that only adds to the book's charm for me.  Rudy Rucker - Software So this is the stuff I was missing out on when I'd stoped reading SF. Rucker's vision of the future still seems incredibly plausible, if not inevitable, a little over two decades after the book was written. It's a sleek, irreverent cyber-punk romp that deals with 'big' issues with the same cocky insouciance with which it inserts sly references to Asimov's much-vaunted laws and Hubbard's pseudo-religious forays. Enough ideas for a lesser author to spin entire series out of, presented in a deceptively slim paperback. I have to get the other two volumes in the sequence.  Maureen F. McHugh - China Mountain Zhiang Another future that seems quite plausible - an unipolar world, dominated by Red China. There is a wealth of social, political and technological extrapolation here, much of which is intrinsic to the plot, but the essential theme is the age-old fable of the gifted outsider coming to terms with the fact that he's smarter than most people in the system that surrounds him. Not very original, but told with enough insight and innovation to make it worthwhile. The side-plot about human settlers on Mars adds a whole extra dimension which the story - and the storytelling - is strong enough to support.   Also reading Castro's speeches and the Fukuyama book.   Foo! I need to fall sick more often...

       from our trusted correspondent:  Located in the Pacific [for now] The Republic of Ideological Euphoria is a country run by Democratic Socialists. It has an Average civil rights record, a Reasonable economy and SOME political freedoms. It's a tiny, devout nation, remarkable for its compulsory military service. Its hard-nosed population of 5 million are fiercely patriotic and enjoy great social equality; they tend to view other, more capitalist countries as somewhat immoral and corrupt. The enormous government is mainly concerned with Religion & Spirituality, although Law & Order and Healthcare are on the agenda. The average income tax rate is 34%, but much higher for the wealthy. A small but healthy private sector is led by the Automobile Manufacturing industry, followed by Furniture Restoration and Basket Weaving. Crime -- especially youth-related -- is relatively low, thanks to a well-funded police force. Ideological Euphoria's national animal is the owl and its currency is the shenzo. [latest reports confirm that the Supreme Council of Tonse headed by The Demagogue is unhappy with certain priorities, and their order, and was planning on planning a revolution to overthrow himself so that he can start all over again. apparently this is not allowed under natural laws.]

      A hacker mantra that I first encountered in theworks of Ken MacLeod.  What a smart chap.  I'm sure EVERYTHING in his books is a reference to something or other. For some reason, people don't quite see him in the light of a serious literary SF writer like Adam Roberts or some such, but he's not quite a space-opera hack, either.   I think he is something new in the SF field, something that doesn't quite conform to too many accepted models of 'literary' value, inside or outside SF, although he has enough of the trappings of wide-screen SF adventure to sucker the generic audience in. And get published, of course. A sort of cosmic joker.  Anyway, leaving aside this meditation on the man, here's an interesting link about that mantra:  urlLink  HERE.

      I visited the Bangalore book Fair on Sunday. Apart from realising once again that Ihave a nearly pathological aversion to crowds (my left hand kept clenching into a fist by the end of it all), I also scored some pretty good stuff:  SF:  Software - Rudy Rucker China Mountain Zhiang - Maureen F. McHugh Circuit of Heaven - Dennis Danvers Parable of the Sower - Octavia Butler Heavy Weather - Bruce Sterling Double Star - Robert Heinlein The Parasaurians – Robert Wells The Alien Factor - Stan Lee  Other fiction: Father Sergius and other stories - Tolstoy Complete Stories of Dostoyevsky (For a friend)   Rock-related: Somebody to love? - Grace Slick In his own write & Spaniard in the works - John Lennon  Other stuff: The True Jihad - Maulana Wahiduddin Khan Fidel Castro on Imperialist Globalisation In Patagonia - Bruce Chatwin Socialogy - The Central Questions (For my sister, to help with her studies)  Werewolves, shapeshifters and skinshifters - Marika Kriss (For a friend)  Books I wanted to but but couldn't afford: This ginormous Batman thingy. Sort of a history of the character and all his manifestations across the media (including lunchboxes and stuff). David Gray's book on Modernity and the Al-Qaeda (can't recal the exact name). Waiting for the paperback. This really cool book on Indian myths and legends from the Ramakrishna Math - I'm sure I'll be able to get that at the local Math later.  A whole lot of Far Side omnibuses (omnibii?). I'm going to see if I can round enough money to make one more visit the Fair. If not -well, mustn't be TOO greedy...I guess...

      Saturday, I went to see 'The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Ever since I followed the adventures of a darkly humorous, mysterious avenger called V For Vendetta, in a comic called Warrior, I've been a huge fan of Mr. Alan Moore, the genius who created the comic the movie is based on.  Quite apart from that,being a somewhat literate person, I've read all the old books the extraordinary gentleman - and lady - are from, so it was a chance to re-visit some old favourites.  One of the friends that I dragged along was quite determined not to like it, based on a very bad screen print she'd suffered through and a common assumption among somewhat intelligent people that anything big,shiny and entertaining has to suck.  I insisted on her coming along, figuring that this would be a chance to show another seeker that there is life beyond the ironic stance. And sure enough - one round of fisticuffs, one trademark Connery smile and quip into the movie, and we were all snared, drawn into the consensual magic that a really good big-screen entertainer creates. (SPOILER ALERT) I won't go so far as to say the movie didn't have flaws - the script was rather cliched at times, there were a few logical problems for those who look out for that sort of thing (why didn't M just kill 'em all when they were gathered in his HQ? Why that elaborate charade of breaking into Dorian's house as The Phantom? and so on).  I also know that some people feel the movie was not a fit vehicle for Naseeruddin Shah (I remember some wank in Outlook complaining that an actor of his calibre had to do Jackie Chan-style high kicks). And why not? He had fun, we had fun watching him, and he got paid. t's not like he had to do something demeaning. His character had great dignity and power and was second only to Connery's in that sense. And it may be a cheap shot, but I liked the Shiva Linga motiff used in the design of the Nautilus.  All in all, a good time was had by all. My friend succesfully transcended into post-ironic bliss and we wolfed down tons of buttered popcorn in the process. A world where a film like this does not make bonzo money is a bit of a shoddy place, I think.

As for the 'real' truth, like the man said...   All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.

      The true idealistic state can only be virtual.  When we all upload ourselves into a hyperreal construct, everything is stripped to the idea at its core. Sartre falls into the fire as Plato takes control of the cave, wall and all.  Then there is no duality in reality, no reality as we now define it, as a compromise or a dim reflection or a limited fact, limited by its own objective existence. Then all is ideal.   Rich or poor? Just choices. Happiness or misery? Just passing fads.   All this may seem  frivolous, hedonistic to us now, grave, grave-bound, flesh-bound earth-crawlers that we are.  We are so used to holding to ideals despite reality.  Imagine how much dearer, clearer and truer all these ideals will become when there is no obstacle, no 'ground reality' to soil their logical, fantastic progressions.   ==  There will be backsliding. There will be transition.   Given eternity, neither decadence nor irony will be tenable for very long. Exposed for the hollow stances they are, these props will be cast aside.   All this is well and good for you and me, the transcenders.   The disappearing ones.   But what about the inevitable second generation, the ones who never were, and will be forever?   Because there will reproduction. The cycle will carry on. The wheel will turn. It's what wheels do.   What then?  ==  What comes next is The Future.   ==

Obvious jokes (which I have studiously avoided cracking aren't I a good boy?) aside, this is a significant development for two reasons - techniques used to make mice live longer may well have a direct bearing on finding ways to make humans live longer, something I have a very selfish interest in. (I want to live FOREVER!!!)   Also, a prize like this should help raise awareness and hopefully support for this research area.

Here are some pearls of wisdom from this man about the growing US interest in exotic musical flavours: "I think that you need something that is going to be more innovative. I think just generally if you mix Asian music with Egyptian music or Spanish music or pop music -- you get a different sound."   Some other gems by this hot new music phenom: 'Bhangra is all about the beat- you fuse it with R+B, rap, hip hop or reggae- and that's what makes people want to dance.'  'I'm so excited about bringing my culture into the mainstream because I can show people where we come from and what our culture is about and what our music is about. It's all about dancing and having a good time.'  Why does the media even bother reporting inane tautologies and Uncle Remus-style ingratiation like this?

      Sedate the people. Sell them toys and drugs and more toys. Make them work harder and harder (for your favoured coporate sponsors) so that they can earn more money to buy more toys and more drugs. Never let them think. Focus on how the message is beig presented, not on what the message is. Tell them a fairy tale or a limerick, but never a parable. Beg off all discussion of real import with the damning accusation that it is 'cerebral'. And when all this doesn't work, throw law to the winds and stuff those ballots.

      Many years ago I had to a write a Maths supplementary exam. The whole afair was a charade - halfway through a peon walked in and started reading out the answers to us. I've never enjoyed this kind of shortcut, so I ignored the man, wrote down the few answers I could figure out on my own and then, to fill up space, wrote down most of Coleridge's Kubla Khan from memory.   Oddly, I passed the exam anyhow.  Well, that poem is a good example of how works of art are often built up from external sources, original as they may be. Coleridge's own story was that he was reading Marco Polo's Travels and doing opium when he composed about a1,000 lines in his head (before being interrupted by that 'man from Porlock' (apparently an insurance salesman, most likely a time-traveller or perhaps Dirk Gently). But subsequent research has thrown up everything from 'Purchas' Pilgrimage' to Fielding's 'Tom Jones' as a source.   It was JL Lowes' 'The Road To Xanadu' that began the rush to trace out every possible source for Coleridge's 2 most enigmatic poems - Xanadu and the one about the wierd old sailor. Although there is some validity in seeing imagination as a sort of aggregative force, with a voracious reader like Coleridge, this sort of exercise can get out of hand. One hyped-up scholar went to the extent of writing a paper on the influence of Beowulf on Coleridge, stating rather inanely that "since Beowulf is a noted achievement in the history of the race it could have filtered down into Coleridge's mind via some inspirational afflatus from on high.   At any rate, if dreamers are not always the authors of their own dreams, does it matter whether Coleridge had read Beowulf". And I supose it doesn't matter whether Colerdige wrote Xanadu either?  The poem itself is infinitely fascinating and has inspired all manner of activity, from the odd academic alleys alluded to above to popping up (along with the Ancient Mariner)  in a Douglas Adams novel, to prompting Orson Welles to name the mansion in Citizen Kane Xanadu (Mandrake's mansion, too is called Xanadu, by the way) to serving as the name for Ted Nelson's hypertext project.   Lastly, here is a rather odd, though amusing parody of Xanadu:     urlLink here   There's also a rather lovely song by Rush called Xanadu. Look for it.

The Rogue Nation of Knivesout  "Something easy to remember"   UN Category: Left-Leaning College State  Civil Rights: Superb  Economy: Good  Political Freedoms: Very Good   Location: The Queensland     The Rogue Nation of Knivesout is a large, safe nation, notable for its strong anti-business politics. Its intelligent population of 29 million enjoy extensive civil freedoms, particularly in social issues, while business tends to be more regulated.   It is difficult to tell where the omnipresent, liberal government stops and the rest of society begins, but it juggles the competing demands of Education, Social Welfare, and Healthcare. The average income tax rate is 69%, and even higher for the wealthy. The private sector is almost wholly made up of enterprising fourteen-year-old boys selling lemonade on the sidewalk, although the government is looking at stamping this out.   All tarrifs have been abolished, military funding has been stripped back, citizens must pay to enjoy Knivesout's pristine beaches, and the government awards prizes to television shows featuring stereotype-breaking minority roles. Crime is relatively low. Knivesout's national animal is the Reactionary Hyena, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the Filthy Lucre.   Knivesout is ranked 7th in the region and 67,829th in the world for Largest Soda Pop Sector.

      OK. First of all, let me make one thing quite clear: all auto-drivers and waiters are my enemies. Their indiiference, inefficiency and dishonesty defies belief. It is now a significant part of my life's mission to treat these sub human creatures with maximum aggro and contempt.   Leaving that aside, I had a rather good weekend. Saturday, I met a couple of friends of mine from Greenpeace at Pecos and had a long talk. I tend to be pretty sceptical about the 'greens', so I bombarded them with dozens of questions, especially about their ongoing campaign against Bayer,and, encouragingly, they had pretty good answers most of the time.   I happened to have a copy of a von Daniken book wth me (Return to the stars), so I got into another conversation with another friend about the Bermuda Triangle (he thinks it's a wandering wormhole of some sort). I am a skeptic by nature, but I enjoy the cranky sode of life immensely. Which reminds me, my pet cranks, the Prophecykeepers, have sent me part 2 of their course. I must check it out soon.   Sunday was good too - a quiz, the first in ages, with my team - Shenoy and Viru. We're called Team:Roadkill. As usual we had a last-minute 4th member, a very cool chap called Ashwin, who really knew his stuff and made a significant contribution. Sadly, we missed the finals by half a point. Which left us free to wander around town, visit Blossom Book house and drink lots of coffee.   In the evening, Shenoy and me killed some time n Styx, then I met a couple of other friends at Java City and then it al was over.

      The whole week was such a trip.   Wednesday, I get to Pecos and it turns up it's my friend Gopal's birthday. Much beer ensues. Then we goto another friend's place for more beer and some vodka. As I'm finally going tosleep, the boys pull out these LPs of Maiden and Priest...  Thursday an old college friend was in town, so we met for lunch. We haven't met since PUC so that was quite a catch-up. He's now an advocate in the Supreme Court.   In the evening I went to Styx where there was this rather appealing young thing grooving to Pearl Jam's unplugged version of Alive. Have you heard that thing about eye contact? A little hapened. Later on she came over and asked me to ask the DJ to play 'Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In  Small Town'. Impressed, I passed the request on. The DJdidn't have that song, so I got him to play 'Wishlist' for her instead. Then it was closing time. She came over and thanked me quite wnsomely before exiting. Much later I realised I totally forgot to get her name,number, ANYTHING. Bah.  Next, Pecos. It was manager man Elangovan's birthday so a little free beer happened for a select few at the very end. Thena bunch of us went next door for more beer at Brigade Fuel. This girl sits next to me and we talk. Well, basically, we play 20 Questions, which I enjoy. Can't really recall her name either. After that, dinner at Savera and then home.   Friday was tamer. Although there was one all-waiters-are-bastards incident that I shall narrate later.

      This has been a rather eventful week so far. If things carry on like this, I shall probably die quite soon.  On Monday, my grandmother was ill so I stayed home to look after the house until my sister (who was recovering from another vampiric night crawl - old Vlad should BEWARE if he ever runs into this young lady!!!)woke up. Once I reached work there were, of course, thousands of things to be done. Wen it all was over, I did the usual unwind at Coffee House with trusted accomplices like Shenoy. Then I decided to hit Styx for a mug (always just a mug) and, by Gum, a friend of mine, Ashley, was having a birthday celebration. We wound up drinking till they chucked us out and then relocated to Mohan's Bar to carry on. Well, I curbed my drinking because I had an early meeting the next day, but I still can't claim I was being as virtuous as I might have. It was a night of drunken philosophy and bleary, beery sentiments.  Tuesday I reach office at 9.30 and IMMEDIATELY Ashok and me head down to the Wipro office at Sarjapur where we had to meet obscene numbers of Wiproites, one after the other, all the way till 3.00 PM at which point they very kindly released us to go meet another Wiproite at Castle Street. Woo hoo. We got back to office by 6.30, feeling dead inside. Naturally heaps of work awaited, and I was in till about 7.30 handling that. On to Coffee House, some book shopping and then to Styx for a mug (just one mug of course). At Styx I meet my friend Anand who is back in Bangalore after nearly a year in Madras, so we drink and talk till closing time when I relocate to Pecos where another friend is celebrating his 30th birthday...  Let's see how long I can keep this up...

      This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot.  I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower.  Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess. The two things that threw me off were the sudden appearance of an Illuminati-like group towards the very end - they just seemed to pop up from leftfield and exit in similar fashion - and the fact that the Storm Troupe, the group of heavy weather hackers who act as the book's central characters, just seem to disperse placidly into seperate lives once their epiphany is achieved. maybe I'm missing something here?  The World of Ptavvs is Larry Niven's first novel. I have two of his other books too -The Mote in God's Eye a collection of short stories called The Inconstant Moon. I decided to put off reading The Mote in favour of this one. It remains to be seen how that much-praised pace-opera classic will strike me, but I'm glad I did so. The writing is a bit awkward, the plot perhaps a bit too twisty at times, but this is the most enjoyable big-scale SF I've read in a while, complete with a space-chase across the solar system, talking dolphins and ancient alien astronauts. Oh, and a spacecraft called the Heinlein. What more could a boy ask for?  And now we come to Parable. I started on it late sunday night and just had to stay up until I finished it. it's just barely SF by conventional standards - it happens in the future, there are elements of technological and, especially, social and historical extrapolation, but the book is essentially a spiritual one, conveying a whole new (to me at least) twist on the age old problem of god. At the same time, it manages to be a gripping, beautfully told tale with people you really care for and events that draw you in as if you were there. Well, that's how it worked for me anyway. I don't feel up to commenting at greater length right now - this really isn't a book you can sum up too easily. I somehow hope Frank Herbert read this one, I think he would have approved...

      Cynthia Kenyon is an anti-aging expert with some intersting ideas on slowing aging at the gene level. According to her, aging is not just a natural process of 'wearing out'. It is a process regulated by genes. She says she has created worms who live to be the equivalent of 450 (the article says 150 but I checked this quote elsewhere, and she says 450!!!) year-olds in the bodies of 75 year olds. This can be duplicated in humans, theoretically, and she's working on it. In the meantime, the only proven way to prevent/retard aging is diet. *yawn*  Here's a recent  urlLink interview  from New Scientist.   This is her lab,  urlLink Wormworld.

      Light can travel faster than light, apparently, but information cannot. This preserves the chain of causality as we know it, and does no damage to Einstein's assertion that information (defined as any signal that can effect an object or device) cannot exceed the speed of light (c).  Apparently, however, some photons actually can exceed c in certain conditions. One of the conditions under which this can happen is what the boffins call 'gain-assisted linear anomalous dispersion to demonstrate superluminal light propagation in atomic caesium gas'. However, this occurence can be brought on only in specific conditions, in what they call fast-light mediums (there are a few other ways in which photons can be made to exceed c, but except the one just mentioned they seem to create distortions in the light pulses which corrupt the information content). This research had not real implication for projects dear to SF fan like me, such as FTL or time travel, but it did suggest that Information could be transmitted at superluminal speeds. New research published in this week's Nature however, seems to suggest this too is not a possibility.  Apparently, while some photons may exceed c, information does not. The exact reason doesn't seem to be known yet, but researchers have just found that the time to detect information propagating through a fast-light medium is slightly longer than the time required to detect the same information travelling through a vacuum. So relativistic causality is safe. For the time being, anyhow.   urlLink Detection rescues cause and effect : The Nature article about this new research, with links to abstracts of relevant papers.   urlLink Some Things Can Apparently Move Faster Than The Speed of Light  : A 2000 article on the research conducted on light exceeding lightspeed in atomic caesium gas.

The WTO went ahead with its fall meeting, shamelessly dangling the newly poor in the wake of September 11 as the reason, without mentioning its own deeper complicity in this impoverishment.

      Leaving aside the Americana, these excerpts from the testimony to be given by Planetary Society leaders to Congress sometime today are quite interesting and even inspiring:  Dr. Murray will comment "Mars is the true space frontier; it is the legitimate abode for the dreams of the young for many generations to come. Thus, America should lead the world in that grand, positive human endeavor. We can use some of our enormous and visible technological capability to dramatically demonstrate our commitment to Earth's future beyond the blood and conflict which inevitably will color much of the 21st century."   Dr. Wesley T. Huntress Jr., President of The Planetary Society   Dr. Huntress will say, "The human space flight program is marching into a blind alley, stuck in Earth orbit with an expensive, complex and risky infrastructure not designed to support destinations beyond Earth orbit. We need to establish Mars as a destination for human space flight in the next 50 years; retire the Shuttle in favor of a simpler, less risky and less costly system; limit the Space Station to research on human physiology in space; and devise a new architecture to establish a permanent human presence in deep space."  I think Asimov or Clarke were in favour of a moonbase first, though, and I'm not sure which would be better. Perhaps the impetus of a whole new planet is what we need at this point rather than something so much closer home.   This is all obvously in response to the  urlLink taikonaut affair,  but I don't mind if it results in a shot in the arm to humanity's now-moribund march to the space age.

      The state of my state:  The Rogue Nation of Knivesout "Something easy to remember"  UN Category: Left-Leaning College State  Civil Rights: Superb Economy: Good Political Freedoms: Good   Location: The Queensland The Rogue Nation of Knivesout is a very large, environmentally stunning nation, remarkable for its strong anti-business politics. Its compassionate population of 109 million enjoy extensive civil freedoms, particularly in social issues, while business tends to be more regulated.  It is difficult to tell where the omnipresent, liberal government stops and the rest of society begins, but it juggles the competing demands of Education, Social Welfare, and the Environment. The average income tax rate is 78%, and even higher for the wealthy. The private sector is almost wholly made up of enterprising fourteen-year-old boys selling lemonade on the sidewalk, although the government is looking at stamping this out.  Political parties are banned from advertising and receiving private donations, surveillance cameras are banned, there have been reports of people marrying housepets, and citizens are enjoying a recent large cut in taxes. Crime is well under control. Knivesout's national animal is the Reactionary Hyena, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the Filthy Lucre.  Knivesout is ranked 3rd in the region and 23,975th in the world for Healthiest Nations.

      A review of Phillip K Dick's Time Out Of Joint  Before I get into the plot, I'd like to point out how well written this book is. In the opening sequence, PKD sketches out the characters of the main players - Rigle Gumm, his sister Margo and brother in law Vic and their neighbours, the Blacks, with amazing vividity and economy.A few sentances is all he needs to make them real. Similarly, this book captures his ear for crisp, convincing dialogue. The economy of his writing again comes out in the fact that, even though he barely sketches in most of his settings, they are quite real in the reader's mental eye.   The plot centers around Ragle Gumm, WW2 vet, who lives with his sister's family, makes a lot of money solving newspaper puzzles and flirts with his neighbours wife. But there are subtle discrepancies. He sometimes sees objects vanishing. A radio his nephew makes enables him to listen to mysterious conversations,including one about him. He finds an old magazine which mentions a famous actress called Marilyn Monroe - but he's never heard of her. He finds an entire telephone directory full of numbers that don't even seem to exist. Perhaps he's just paranoid, cracking up? The truth is far stranger.   PKD masterfully explores the process by which the reality behind Gumm's oddly neat and tidy world is discovered -the conflict in Gumm's mind between the unfolding realisation, and the fear that perhaps he is just going mad.   The revelation, when it happens is fairly unexpected and satisfying. I won't go into the details, but it's about space - where we SHOULD be going, but apparently many people disagree.   So, this is a well-written, rewarding book. Not an absolute classic, but not one that's just for the PKD fans either. I wonder if the makers of The Truman Show ever read this book.

      Finished Phillip K Dick's Time Out Of Joint and William Gibson's Idoru. Both really good. Starting on Charles Sheffield's Darwin book.  Also crawling through Poe's Eureka. Some of it could be described as word play, but his grasp of the nature of the cosmos is breathtaking, and often quite ahead of his time. A side of the horror maestro not many know of, I guess.

      Baudolino is turning out to be well worth the wait (I'd first heard of it around LAST October, which was roughly when it was released, but a copy only found its way to a stall near me this month). There's something very comforting about Eco. The book seems to be a sort of exploration of how dreams, fantasies and straight-out lies can create reality. Baudolino is a person who has uttered lies which have been believed throughout his life - and now he is trying to figure out the story of his own life, and is finding it tough to define where the line between fact and fantasy is anymore.   Sometimes I wish I knew Italian just so I could read Eco and also Italo Calvino, another favourite,  in the original. In the meantime, the only Italian phrase I know, 'vieni a letto con me', is quite inappropriate in this context...

      Work is seriously piling up. Hence my sparse updates.  In my free time, my reading is chugging along fairly nicely though. I'm currently on the new Eco, which is turning out quite well. It's got the whimsy of 'The Island' with the sense of depth of the other two books. Some twat somewhere praised Dan Brown saying that he is proving you can write historical fiction in vernacular English, not just scholarly Italian. Frankly, that remark has totally put me off Dan Brown. I will be true to Professor Umberto... Also reading Blish's Cities in Flight sequence, a sadly overlooked space-opera epic. Well, it's not quite the conventional space-opera but it does share that kind of sweep and setting.  Haven't done any writing in a long time. Damn...

      A good weekend. The best in weeks? Perhaps, let's see.  I did manage to drink a fair amount of beer, engage in various kinds of conversations from the inanely pun-strewn to the pitched and profound and meet a fair cross-section of the people I know. I blew up uneasonable amounts of money on second hand books, but that's just standard operating procedure by now.   Next month I am screwed - a whole lot of good stuff, including the new Ken MacLeod and Dozois' lates annual anthology - has hit the stores. Poor me.   I finished a couple of good reads - Phillip K Dick's Dr. Bloodmoney and Charles Sheffield's The Amazing Dr. Darwin. Both highly worthwhile. I also managed to listen to a lot of music.foo.

      Ok.   Frankly, if Dan Brown is the best mainstream fiction has to offer, I shall continue to stay away from that kettle of cod.  I enjoyed his plot but did not enjoy his writing. I don't think there is a contradiction there.   I found the book quite gripping until the end, when the twists just started piling on a little too thick.   Oddly, I don't mind this sort of stuff in a movie, but this is not my kind of book.  It is not MY kind of book - that's all. I may have chosen to crib about the sort of critical reviews Brown gets, but that has more to do with cribbing about professional reviewers (ratings whores that they are) than with the process by which I formed my opinion of the book in question. Remember, it came to me highly reccomended by someone whose opinion I DO value,and I still didn't like it eventually.   Looking forward to Baigent though!!!  Finally in our usual spirit of one-upmanship, a few peripheral rejoinders:  The Beatles analogy doesn't fit - they started at a time when the overall rock lyric was of that faishion and then were among the first bands to show you could write about something else.   RK Narayan's prose is BETTER than Roy's - it is economical and clear. Vocabulary is NOT the yardstick I use.    Lastly, If reading Eco makes me too accustomed to quality, I fail to see what is wrong with that. Going by that argument,  a classical music listener, for instance, has no right to criticise bhangra-pop.

      hey jp, visited your blog after quite some time, it was interesting but..like i told you i actually wanted to put up what follows on the blog, but i thought it wasn't ethically right on my part to do so. read it and if you feel there's anything in it, put it up on the blog. i leave the choice entirely up to you.  so here's my ramble.......  Man, in an age where Jerry Cantrell opens as a support act for Nickleback, can we afford to lead our lives and let our thoughts be swayed by the teeming multitude of sub-normal intelligences. We know that a generation brought up on sidney sheldons and britney spears et al will never 'appreciate' a Michael moorcock or a doves. But just because they do not acknowledge these things do not mean we give up on these timeless classics. but that said, sometimes even these sub-sixty IQ possessors do sometimes strike gold (not unlike the classic and oft quoted example of giving a bunch of monkeys a bunch of typewriters, and given enough time they'll churn out shakespeare's sonnets). But just because they endorse a certain artist or writer does not mean we can take it for granted that their current 'flavour of the month' is crappy. If we do that we're merely, like I said, falling into the trap of letting their uncooked and nitwitted thoughts cloud our judgment.  So why am I saying this? Because I've been noticing your attitude towards dan brown nowadays. It seems to be swinging from one end to other. On the one hand you appreciate his plotting and pacing, but then go on to sprinkle it with a review written by someone who doesn't understand what she's talking about. You say that Angels & Demons is the kind of book you wouldn't read if it didn't have all those history/conspiracy angles, but then, my question is, what else do you need? Let me rephrase, isn't that enough, for the time being? What'd you expect? Appendices and footnotes? In a mainstream fiction book? Dan brown never said anything about promising theses on the illuminati and or supersonic jets. He wanted to write a mainstream novel that would appeal to the 'masses' so that he could make some money and I think he's succeeded in both of these endeavours. I think that so used have we become to the literary quality of a eco that we find anything even a little below it worthless.  Speaking of creativity for the masses, look at the beatles. They wrote for the masses. They were the first boy band 9and you know how we hate boy bands). But their songs today are anthems. they're the beatles. "I get high when I see you go by, my oh my, when you sigh my mind inside just flies, butterflies" Are these great lines of poetry? but it's the beatles and they did it in the way that only the beatles could. They played for the masses. But they made their point. bad analogy maybe, but you see the point.  But the difference between you and me reading Angels & Demons or a Da Vinci code, compared to let's say, a person who only reads jeffrey archer, is that we can appreciate the subject matter more because we've read up enough on them and we know the general background from where brown is coming from. For a person who's read foucualt's pendulum, the da vinci code or angels & demons is a breeze. But it does not in anyway devalue brown's efforts.   And then you got totally put off Dan Brown because some twat somewhere praised Dan Brown saying that he is proving you can write historical fiction in vernacular English, not just scholarly Italian. You know he's a twat, and twats usually come up with twatty reviews and remarks, so why bother?  Ok so his characterization is like ready-to-order template for a Hollywood casting crew. Think Robert Langdon, think Harrison ford. Think of the camerlengo and Gabriel Byrne comes straight to my mind. yes, it does not show too much of originality on brown's part, but is that such a bad thing? I'm just coming off Philip K Dick's Man in the High Castle and you should see the characters in that. Dick is so descriptive about each character and their attributes that a seasoned movie watcher who's also interested in kung fu movies can easily come up with a cast for high castle just like that. But does that mean dick is bad or that he has 20/20 vision when it comes to Hollywood. If anything look at the number of his books that have been turned into movies. As to the point that everybody seems to have had a trauma, I think in the context of the story it all unwinds it self out well. At least it's not meaningless. It's like the claasic bollywood formula. Action, drama, suspense, sex, emotion all in one. It kinda makes the story that much more interesting. And as to everybody in angels having a grouse or a 'drama' in life, in the said context it provides every character with a "motive" which I think is the usual case with any book, great or otherwise. In this particular book, all the drama that you so disliked was actually convenient to the author wouldn't you say? Everybody had a reason to be doing what they are doing or did, and are in the place they are right now.   Twists and turns also, aren't bad. It's at least better than the boy-meets-girl formula.  And like I told you the other day, I don't consider the quality of prose or the vocabulary used as an indication of a book's quality or as a yardstick to judge the idea. If both are good, nice. But I think it's the 'idea' that matters. If vocabulary and artyfarty prose were the benchmarks arundhati roy would be kicking rk narayan's ass. But give me an rk narayan any day. Arundhati roy can console herself with the things of small dogs.   Now that I've said all this I'll tell you why I like dan brown and why I've feverishly read 3 of his books. The 4th will not escape my grasp for a long time. Firstly I like his pluralist attitude. And his choice of subjects. His pacing. His twists. To tell you the truth I read da vinci code in 2 sitting all because I was saying to myself "just one more page" "just one more page". More on me later. But I guess I've as usal rambled on enough and I shall in the interests of conclusion, wind up this ramble once more reiterating, dan brown isn't as bad as you make him out to be.  -Shenoy

      They have plans. They make calls. They drive cars or perhaps just modified Bisleri bottles. They do not have lockjaw at this point in time. The easiest lessons are the ones that burn. Even without plans they go places. There are places. There are people. There is a sound. Do you remember when the sound was your sound? Now it is a plastic wafer you cannot savour try though you may to douse it with ketchup and/or tomato chutney.   Sometimes they talk cosmic. When they do this the universe shrinks and becomes real. God leaps up from the old easychair in the verandah at the retirement home and leans in close listening giggling and laughing out loud. Sometimes they feel quite kindly towards humanity.  They will not tell you what a harpy was or who Shoko Asahara is.   On this warm afternoon, neither will I.

      Thoughts on Angels and Demons? A tight, gripping plot. Average-to-mediocre prose. Low information density, considering it's a historical/tech-spec novel. And I feel he lays on the twists a bit too thick - by the time the final twist happened, I just couldn't care a damn anymore.   Oh and check this out, this is the ridiculous review of The Davinci Code I'd mentioned earlier:   WOW...  Blockbuster perfection. An exhilaratingly brainy thriller.  Not since the advent of Harry Potter has an author so flagrantly delighted in leading readers on a breathless chase and coaxing them through hoops.  --Janet Maslin  THE NEW YORK TIMES

      I've started out on Dan Brown's Angels And Demons. The prose is pedestrian - mediocre at best. But the story is compelling and easy reading. I'll probably finish it tonight.   I guess my prose standards are just a bit too artyfarty, but I do find this mainstream-thriller way of writing quite off-putting. For one thing all the descriptions of characters read like they were written keeping in mind a Hollywood casting director's needs. And the depth of allusion is just - it's just not happening. Brown writes for the average, dismally ignorant American reader, I guess.   This is the kind of book I wouldn't read if it didn't have all those history/conspiracy angles. Yes, the plot is very compelling. Still, it's distressing to see the sort of reviews Brown gets, one person actually described it as the most exciting read since Harry Potter or something lke that. This is a sad world we live in and I'm glad I'm not here forever.

      Far too many reviews of Umberto Eco's Baudolino attempt to measure it by the standards of The Name Of the Rose. That was a far more straightforward (or at least recognisable) creature - a Holmesian pastiche, set in a mediaeval monastery and laced with generous dollops of Eco's trademark erudition. It followed the familair pattern of the Doyle-esque tale of detection through ratiocination, it consciously worked around a recognisable and familiar template, which is probably why it went down so well.   Like The Island of the Day Before, Baudlino is far more removed in time, not chronologically so much as in narrative approach. I'm no mediaevalist, but I have read enough legends and traveller's tales from the era to recognise where Eco is coming from on this one. Like most narratives from the era it depicts, this book rambles from one event to the next taking time to detail minutae like the journeys between places, lavish background detail on each new location and so on. It adapts to the content - from Baudlolino's exploits as a Parisian student to high intrigue and manuevering in his mentor and adopted father, Barbarossa's court to tales of battle and the wide-screen traveller's yarn that is the high point of the story. Many reviewers seem to feel that this supposed infelicity of the writing of that era could have been avoided - I advise them to stick with Jeffrey Archer in future. At some point, you have to agree to take a book like this on certain terms - suspend your 'modern' yen for tight plotting and extensive character developemnt, and you will be amply rewarded with a feast of delights both sacred and profane.   Yes, the tale rambles - but why is that a bad thing? It's the story of the life of one person, and our lives do tend to be rather rambling and directionless at times, and considering that the narrator is an expert liar who has ceased being able to tell apart his own lies from reality, fantastic elements are inevitable.   What I would complain about is, on that long journey (with passes through all manner of wonders, including a river of stone - surely both Eco and his translator's central achievement of sheer descriptive prose in this work - and the mountan fortress of the Assassins) Eco is less concerned with developing the characters - who all wind up seeming rather hollow with the exception of Baudolino himself - than with describing the fantastic. The narrative itself is a bit unstable - essentially we are overhearing Baudolino telling the story of his life to a historian whom he has rescued from the sack of Contantinople, but more often, it seems as if the story is being told by an omniscient author who is not afraid to butt in and share his opinions.   But these are minor complaints. Baudolino is an entertainment - and a succesful one at that, which also manages to raise questions about the relation between reality and fantasy, the reliability of history and the like. I could go on about these philosophical questions, but like the endless debate between two of Baudolino's companions on the existence of the vacuum, that's a discussion that could go on forever without any real resolution.

      Another relaxed weekend. Friday went by largely without incident, apart from a rather nice Diwali lunch with the grandparents. I'd been resisting the idea for a while, for no real reason except a sort of carry-over of the adolescent's unease towards socialising with the older generation. Well, I finished adolescing some time ago, and it is time to move on.   In the evening, I met Prem who is finally down from Dubai. He's going to be in India for a while now - so hopefully some good music/movie binges await. Plus Prem cracks good jokes. Prem also had a gift for me - a  urlLink Holga.  Await further developments.  Saturday morning I wandered around Hennur and Fraser Town with Mark, a specialist in 360-degree photography, shooting some buildings for a clients' site. In the evening, my friend Gautham Khandige took a bunch of us out for dinner at a Caribbean restaurant in Indiranagar called Sue's Kitchen. The food was delicious, a lot like our food, but just different enough to make it interesting. I stuffed myself senseless. The piped reggae music, on the other hand, was deeply avoidable.  After that, we headed down to Java City for coffee (iced tea in my case) and conversation. The conversation was slightly hindered by the fact that the cafe had hired a dj for the night, and he felt the need to pump the volume up to justify his presence. The dj was a study in utter redundancy - Java City has a Worldspace connection, and any of the channels on WS could have done what he did - select and play songs from a bunch of cds - without the added annoyance of having this chap hanging around and, as if to compensate for the fact that he himself wasn't actually operating anything apart from the 'play' button, making deeply intense expressions, probably calculated to give the impression that he was somehow making the music happen through sheer mental effort. Bleah. Fuck them and the discs they spin, that's all I can say.   Sunday was a blissfully lazy experience - I never even left home, just wallowed around reading  Eco and Blish. More on that later.

      all this 'recreational reading' business gets me down. what is the term implying?  i am a follower of the written word. and i read because i find no better stimulant than the words (not just for my aging process) ..  so while a lot of the 'recreational reading' material can turn stale, and quite boring, i find meself looking up to arbitrary writings around ..  frankly, i consider all of the opinionated ('critique') stuff to be second-hand words .. but that's just another opinion.  this blog has held my attention for a long (add another long for emphasis) while, solely for the reason that i can appreciate the opinions being posted up here (if not fully comprehend the purpose of some of the repartees) ..  this lone message is a direct result of one line i found in here that really really tickled me .. and in fact, restored my faith in the glory of an individual ..  the line was lost somewhere therein, but over all of the rest, only this matters: "I find that I am less and less interested in logical debate than in exploring my own opinions." - jp  thank you. am going to enjoy today very much.

      Thousands of pilgrims have been flocking to a public toilet in a remote French village, following reports that the face of Christ has miraculously appeared in the limescale in the bottom of one of its toilet bowls. "It is true, the Saviour's face has appeared in the pan of the crapper in the left hand stall of the gents toilets - no matter how much toilet cleaner or bleach you put down there, or how hard you scrub, it always miraculously reappears once the toilet has been flushed," reveals Jacques Coullions, who has been the attendant at the Rennes-le-Chateau public lavatory for over thirty years.

      More fearsome than the the dreaded Dear John, this sinister missive is sent in response to Customer Complaints.   On his site (www.hipiers.com) fantasy punster Piers Anthony recounts the origins of this epistolatory horror:  Once upon a time a traveler took a train ride, and was appalled to find the coach overridden with roaches. He wrote an angry letter to the president of the railroad company. In due course he received the president's response: "Dear Mr. Gleep: Thank you for calling our attention to this problem. We are shocked, shocked to learn that you encountered such a situation. Rest assured that we will do everything in our power to clear our coaches of vermin and maintain the quality of hygiene you have every right to expect. We appreciate responsible passengers such as yourself, and value your business." Well, now; that was very good. But Mr. Gleep noticed that something was clipped to the letter. Apparently it was the president's instruction to his secretary, who had forgotten to remove it before mailing the letter. (Such things can happen when handling hundreds of similar letters a day.) It was a scrawled note: "Send this SOB the bug letter."   You may or may not like Piers Anthony - personally, I wade through his books with great amusement, but no illusions that they have any enduring qualities apart from the ability to amuse me each time. Anyway, he writes a pretty good  urlLink  Newsletter.

      The statement 'Kill 'em all, let god sort 'em out' probably originated in 1209 when the Albigensian Crusade, the genocidal war against Cathar heretics in southern France began.    An officer in the army asked the Papal legate at the siege of Beziers, Arnaud-Amaury, Abbot of Citeaux, how he could tell apart heretics and true believers. He was told: "Show mercy neither to order, nor to age, nor to sex....Cathar or Catholic, Kill them all... God will know his own....".  Ahhhh.   The actual quote as follows:  "Tuez-les tous; Dieu reconnaitra les siens." ("Kill them all; for the Lord knoweth them that are His.")

      Why am I no longer interested in debate?  Consider the fact that I'm a lifelong atheist. My beliefs run contrary to those of virtually everyone I know.   What am I supposed to do? Engage every one of them in an ongoing argument?   For what?   Do I really want to change their minds?   No. I'm not conceited enough to expect people to give up on ways of thinking and feeling that have been dear to them for so long just because I have a few 'rational' reasons why their beliefs are objectively baseless.   An atheist theocracy (if I can use a paradoxical term like that) would be as authoritarian and rigid as any existing system based on religion.   People are varied, and largely set in their ways. I'm not a crusader.   I don't really care all that much for humanity or 'the big picture'.  That's why I'd rather shut up and just pursue my own beliefs and interests without getting into huge sessions of intellectual dissection regarding them.   I don't want to change the world, and I don't want the world to change me.

      It's all just opinion, and I find that I am less and less interested in logical debate than in exploring my own opinions.  I suppose this is the hardening of the mental arteries that precedes the middle-aged phase that awaits me another decade hence.  Honestly though, it is possible to give too much credence to genre. Just to raise the Borwnian sceptre one last time, Pradeep Sebastian, in the sunday supplement of The Hindu, had a line on The DaVinci Code which sums up what I find specious in the praise the lad is getting - it was something like 'imagine finding the concept of the eternal feminine in a mainstream thriler!'. This reminds me of the remark about the singing dog - you are not surprised that is done well, that it is done at all.   Having said that, I realise there are equally questionable sections in my library - all those Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars novels for instance. And I really do seem to forgive HP Lovecraft all the infelicities and ineptitudes of his writing just because those fungi from Yuggoth really do creep me out.   Thank god for differences, and internal inconsistencies. Life would be boring without them, and Shenoy and me wouldn't have the chance to banter (or is it bicker?) like this!!!

      one can only question logic....not personal opinions and another's faith. and in that spirit i can this thing once and for all. i just thought there was a logical argument developing and someone had to take the other side (funny..for a guy who likes authoritarianism, i've always liked 2 sides to an argument) but since it no longer seems to be a logical argument...oh well....  but in the spirit of cleaning up leftovers and wiping off fartleberries, here are a few rejoinders to your rejoinders to my rejoinder to your remarks...  by your own admission your prose standards are a just a bit too artyfarty. by my own admission, as an be seen below, the beatles may have been a bad analogy, but it was just a peripheral point, not the crux of the matter.  NO. nobody actualy has a RIGHT to do anything, rights are all subjective. so it follows that a classical music listener has no RIGHT to criticise bhangra pop, BUT, listening to classical music puts him in a POSITION to criticise songs from the abovementioned genre, provided it is has a sound logical basis. it is so easy to say it's MY opinion, this is what I think and to end it all...because then, another guy just can't say anything. can he?  but yes, on one point i do agree with you, it's a sad world we live in, someone stop it, and i'll log off.....  PS: and this is MY humble opinion

      For the third sunday in a row, I've just stayed at home sleeping reading watching tv. And feeling quite happy with it.  I used to be like this when I was younger, right up until the beginning of my college days, when rock-band and cul-team activities finally sucked me out of my solitary splendor. Then came the pub thing.  This spilled over into my working life, too. At least, until recently.  Lately, a large part of my crowd has more or less dropped out of my life. For one thing, I have a job, and most of my friends from the music crowd don't. So our routines are very different, and mutually exclsive.   Then too, the same applies to most of my working friends also.  I seem quite content with meeting up with people a coule of weekday evenings, and spending my weekends more or less on my own. This may seem odd and somewhat inside-out, but that's what appears to work for me.   It's possible this is just a non-socal phase, like others I've gone through. Only time will tell. In the meantime, no alarms and no surprises, please...

      Well, another week trundles to an end.  I finished two books this week, both very good reads - Greg Bear's Strength of Stones and John Gribbin & Marcus Chown's Reunion.  Strength of Stones builds from a future that that already passed, a turn of the millennium world where people have grown tired of the desert monotheisms and the havoc they have wreaked on the world. Faced with scorn and hostility on all sides, Yehova's children, the remaning Jews, Christians and Muslims buy themselves a desert planet to shift to en masse. They name the planet God-Does-Battle and engage one of humanity's finest architects to build vast computerised mobile cities. These cities are programmed to banish any citizens who fall from the faiths they follow.   Sure enough, in a while, the cities summarily banish all their citizens.   The story - actually three inter-linked short stories - described how humans, human-mimics manufactured by the dying cities and the resurrected architect, returned to to check on his creations' progress manage to find a way to salvage some knowledge from the cities and prevent the people of God-Does-Battle from regressing entirely into savagery.  What I found interesting was the implicit comment on human nature - if we were truly to be accountable to the beliefs we create, we would all fall short. Perhaps these beliefs are meant to be an aspiration, not a guide? Also, there's the question of whether it makes sense to use machines to enforce very human ideas.   At one point, one of the characters reminds a computer in a dying city that it's purpose is supposed to be to serve humanity, and that should override everything else.   What struck me was that the reason the cities had ceased to serve people was because they were trying to follow their initial commands to ensure that these people adhere to the beliefs they had chosen to live by.  Perhaps the real question here is whether religion serves humanity in any positive way. And if it doesn't...  The end of the story left me a bit puzzled though. i'm not sure quite what it meant. The architect, apparently, created a portal back to Earth. And he sends one of the human-mimics through it back to the homeworld. The whole point of this somehow isn't very clear.  The book failed to resolve itself at the very end, but it was still worth the read for the strength of ideas. The story itself worked well, too, except for the ending.   Reunion was another good read. I'll write about that one later.

      Whoa.  I finished Barry Malzberg's The Men Inside last night.  The tech-spec it builds from is one I've come across before -  human miniaturisation for the purpose of entering a livng human body to perform surgery. Fantastic Voyage, anyone?  But Malzberg's vision of the future is drastically different from nearly anything Asimov ever thought up. It's a bleak world where most of humanity subsists in grim, violence-ridden cities Downside and only the elite few can live a better life. One of the few ways out from Downside is to become a Messenger, people who are miniaturised to excise cancers from patients wealthy enough to pay for the procedure.  There is a downside to becoming a Messenger - the process renders them impotent. But this hardly matters to Leslie Blount, who has never had much room for emotion. Although he does seem capable of a fair amount of hate, specifically towards his father, an incessant gambler who keeps thinking up new ways to blow all his money on horse races.   Also, as Blount realises, there is nothing particualrly grand or noble about the Messengers' Institute. By maintaining a stranglehold on the patents for the miniaturisation process, Hulm, the inventor of the Projector, has created an artificial scarcity, ensuring his own wealth and denying treatment to scores of cancer sufferers who are too poor to afford the treatment. Blount decides to declare his contempt for this and walk out on the day of his graduation, but is ultimately carried away by the grandeur of the ceremony and takes his oaths.  Then, when he is a fully-fledged Messenger on his 16th patient, he suddenly discovers the urge to kill his patient.   Messengers who kill are a part of Institute folklore - the proximity to the inner workings of a living being, the ease with which that being can then be made to cease living - surely this is a temptation some would have succumbed to? The folklore has it that such Messengers were not betrayed to the outside world but shuffled off into assignments where they would not directly treat patients.   After a variety of painful flashbacks, awkward fantasies and even more awkward real-life encounters, Blount does the deed. And is caught and executed.   A fairly simple story, in that sense, and written in a sort of breathless, knowing style that manages to be both funny and terribly sad.   But what exactly is it all about?  I think, at some level, it is a refutation of the cozy SF notion that the advance of science and technology will give us all better lives.   To continue with the SF-deconstruction, Malzberg posits a negative equivalent of the bold explorer of final frontiers, an internal astronaut whose feelings about his vocation are as different from that of the typical SF Spacer as is his destination in the tissues of a living human being. Blount seems to be a fairly pathetic person - but not, Malzberg  reassures us, particularly malicious. Finally, his act of murder seems less a retaliation against rich, greedy patients selfishly extending their worthless lives, or a retribution against the venal Institute or perhaps even some long-delayed revenge on his father, as it is an expression of his need to obliterate his own pointless existence. Early on, Blount realises that he cannot really imagine his life as a retired Messenger. As a kid Downside he had no real prospects, as a Messenger, he realises that there are no real prospects.  In the end, he attains the only real 'way out' left to him - his own dissolution.  A terribly negative book then, but not an unenjoyable read at all. I don't know if Malzberg always writes like this - but its an interesting style. A little too intrusive at times, but perhaps more effective in the service of a stronger plot?

      I picked up Ken MacLeod's Engine City, the last volume of the Engines of Light series on Friday. I've been having a great time with it.   Apart from Ken MacLeod's usual dry wit, sly references and vivid visualisations, the whole point of this series is coming together in my head in a rather satisfying way. I'm beginning to see what Jeremy Smith meant by calling his books Gnostic potboilers. The Spider peoples' 'infection' is a source of the sort of personalised realisation of God, which Gnosticism focusses on.  Speaking of the god stuff. There are gods in MacLeod's universe - but they are not God. Theicide is a crime, but one that is very possible and at times even necessary. The gods are perhaps the ultimate 'hidden masters', they are real, we can talk to them, they do not answer prayers, and their sole commandment to us is: KEEP THE NOISE DOWN!  I also enjoy the way MacLeod has tied all the 20th century paranoia about alien Greys, Men In Black, UFOs and abductions into a coherent and even believable meta-story. The man seriously rocks when it comes to that kind of large-scale plot-engineering.   The smaller-scale plot details this time around are a just a little less satisfying - the characterisation just isn't as strong as before and there are times when the plot seems to be folding back on itself in some rather pointless ways.   These are small complaints. Ken MacLeod was the man who pulled me back into rabid SF fandom, and this novel gives me no major reasons to stop considering him to be one of the most important contemporary writers of SF.

      Foo.   I am so busy it's not funny.  There are around four major projects going on in my office, a big presentation today, a shoot on monday and did I mention I was doing a little work on the side, too? I must be some sort of masochist.   However, when i'm happy with the creative direction of at least half these jobs, it feels less onerous. And I am. That was rarely the case when I was in an ad agency, but the virtual medium seems a slightly better place.   Cyberpunk yea yea yea.

      The Prohibitionist must always be a person of no moral character; for he cannot even conceive of the possibility of a man capable of resisting temptation. Still more, he is so obsessed, like the savage, by the fear of the unknown, that he regards alcohol as a fetish, necessarily alluring and tyrannical.  -Aleister Crowley, The Green Goddess

      Quite a weekend, all told. Satruday night in particular developed into the sort of epic drinkalogue I haven't had in ages.   There was also some beer-fuelled Brownian motion among the people at the pub I was in. Basically, this guy lost his balance and fell on me and then I fell on this girl who was standing behind me. Ah, pubs, they're such fun. If I was one of those hot studly rockers you read about wherever it is you read about such things, I'd have wound up pinioned to the woman all night long, but being the sort of soul I am, I merely mumbled aplogies, which were brushed aside politely but with loads of 'metchul attitude' and carried on with my beer. After all, I had only fallen for her in a strictly Newtonian sense.  Sunday Prem and me had a far more dignified drink, but even more enjoyable, followed by dinner at Kohinoor.   I also picked up a couple of good books from the SF Masterworks series - Jack Vance's Emphyrio and Matheson's The Shrinking Man. I'm currently reading Emphyrio and it is very gripping, so far.

      Here are some updates on my recent reading, though:  3rd November:  I've finished Niven and Pournelle's Oath of Fealty. Although it was a decent read, I can't say I liked the book.   It depicts a sort of benign police-state (Todos Santos) in conflict with a fairly normal democratic city ( a near-future Los Angeles), and clearly sides with the police-state. Todos Santos seems to be an embodiment of the more right-wing libertarian ethos. There is great personal freedom, no taxes, but everyone has entered into a contract with the boss. Its a pretty feudal set-up and all the people who live there seem to derive honor from their loyalty to the system and to the chief.   The people who oppose Todos Santos are shown as rather unsympathetic parodies of extreme environmentalist guerillas (including the mandatory burly lesbian, for no real reason) . LA politicians are pulled into the conflict when the son of a leading politico is killed in a raid on Todos Santos. A state of economic warfare between the city and the tower ensues, which is resolved with severe arm-twisitng and skulldugerry by Todos Santos, and also by the nefarious activities of the environmentalists, which clearly show that Todos Santos is right to defend itself in any way, as far as the authors are concerned.   I find the story hard to swallow. I can't imagine that the authors actually want us to think that we should aspire to live in that sort of set-up, in a rigid hierarchy with no real personal liberty or privacy but lots of distracting freedoms and of course the right to get rich. But that, apparently, is what they are selling.   The characters are also one-dimensional and the plot has a variety of inconsequential and even irritating love affairs thrown in.   I've now started on Greg Bear's 'Beyond Heaven's River' and it promises to be a far better read, so far.   Today:  Greg Bear's Beyond Heaven's River is progressing quite nicely. The main character is a WW2 Japanese bomber who is abducted by msyerious aliens and taken to a place where he spends ages living in a virtual world of his own creation while being given info on the world outside. Eventually, the aliens dissappear as mysteriously and he is found by humans of that era. Which is where we come in.  The title refers to the fact that the Japanese call the milky way heaven's river.   So far, the story is quite intriguing, there are lots of questions and the promise of interestingly unfolding answers, although Bear does seem to tend to leave a lot hanging in his novels...

      Oh wow. I've finally regained access to my blog thanks to some rather odd stunts.  Sadly, I've lost track of what I was going to say about the remaining part of trip to Suratkal. Perhaps I shall get around to it another day, but the rhythm has been broken.

      Well here we are again. Back at the grindstone.  But let me tell you all about my trip to Suratkal and Kundapura.  On wednesday, I get to Khandige's house by about 7.45. Olo is already there. I've already stuffed myself silly with a lavish dinner at home, but Khandige's mother offers me more food, so I pig out even more, setting the tone for a very fulfilling journey, stomachwise.  Presently, we pick up our tiny burdens and swagger down to the bus stand, sucking on a clove cigarette and picking up whiskey for the journey. At the bus stand, Olo is convinced that every bus that leaves was actually our bus. Eventually we have to pacify him with a glass of lassi. In due course the bus arrives and takes us on a peripatetic tour of Bangalore. We step out for herbal relief when it stops in Gandhinagar.   Eventually, we leave Bangalore by 11.00 PM. Sleepy and calm after the spliff, I never do get around to drinking that whiskey. I have Iron Maiden on my discman - British Metal is quite the thing to travel to - and soon subside into the mists of sleep.   We reach Suratkal at around 6.30 the next morning, drag ourselves to a cafe where Olo and me forget that people in Karnataka drown their idlis in sambar. The submerged idlis are followed by a rather unique bun, the likes of which I have never tasted elsewhere.  After that, we try and find our way to the groom's house. Several people direct and misdirect us until  finally, we are in the compound next to Ganesh's place, and his neighbours quite gamely makes us jump the wall to get to our destination.  We are greeted warmly and finally get to meet the Ganesh himself. We adjourn to a quiet room upstairs, passing through a chaos of relatives making chirpy birdlike calls to each other. Over coffee and breakfast (yes, more breakfast!) we shoot the breeze.   Later, we walk down to the main part of town to buy film for Khandige's camera and to book a room in a hotel, because we suspect we may want to get a little extra-curricular tonight. We find a room that is both cheap and clean. This is the land of miracles.   Back at Ganesh's place, we loll about as someone fixes up a fan for us. After a while, the Bombay faction arrives - Ravi and Suresh. Much breeze shooting ensues, interspersed with squabbling over who gets to bathe in what order.   In the process, I somehow manage to have my third breakfast of the day.   After breakfast, we head out to visit a beach near Ganesh's place. It is quiet, but not very clean. We are soon to discover THE beach, though. We stroll around the area, meeting several healthy kittens and stopping for some tender coconut water along the way. Then it's back to Ganesh's place.   After that, we all doze off for a while. Wake up just in time for a delicious lunch on Ganesh's terrace.  After that, we head out to the hotel, with strict injunctions from Ganesh to be at his place by 6.00 the next morning to travel with him to Kundapura for the wedding.  Ravi and Suresh are quite pleased with the room, so they'll stay with us, too. I break out the whiskey bottle and Khandige, Olo and I get mildly pasted. Then, we head out to the main beach in town.   Await further details in the next installment, tomorrow.

      'Today I am of the opinion, experientially, that the supposedly visionary aspects of any drug experience, regardless of how marvelous-seeming at the time (or how cocktail-lounge banal) represent no more than a tweaking of incoming stimuli. 'But you're drowning in the waters the mystics walked on,' said a saddened theologian to Leary and Alpert, early on, when they had explained the import of Dr. Hoffman's benison.

      Right now, I'm reading Jack Vance's Night Lamp.  Vance's novels have been described as sci-fantasy. They do not hinge on tech spec or scientific extrapolation but instead paint vivid pictures of the different cultures created by a human diaspora spread across a galactic expanse. They could as easily have been written as straight fantasy.   So why does Vance choose to set his tales in an SF idiom?  I do not think it is because he wanted to tap into the SF market, or that it is a mere case of window-dressing. I think it boils down to the difference between SF and fantasy. Fantasy worlds are entertaining, amazing and often illuminating. But they are only fantasy. By placing his tales in an SF milieu, Vance signals not that he wants them to seem as plausible (or not) as Asimov's Foundation or Banks' Culture, but that he believes that these are stories that relate directly to us. His worlds may never come to be, but he wants us to know that the messages he conveys are as relevant as anything SF at its best has to offer. He is talking to those of us who look ahead and try to discern the shape of things to come, not to those who wish to retreat to some idyllic fantasy land.   In this sense, one of his closest peers is probably Ursula Le Guin.   By the way, he writes beautifully, too.

      There really is a significant amount of apathy in my outlook. I can't really be bothered ranting about the degradation of the media, the death of rock, the loss of harmony and all that bad shit. Guess what? It's all real and I have to live on anyhow.   I am definitely not disengaged from the things I have to do. But I am increasingly uninterested in people and in dialogue. In most cases, it really doesn't matter. I'm usually willing to listen and learn, but when it's one-sided 9 times out of 10 it might be more worthwhile to just stick to nurturng my own subjectivity.   There are things I care about, things that worry me and things that make me happy. But I really don't see them as being earth-shattering enough to want to engage in endless dialectic about them.   So why do I maintain this journal?   So why am I supposed to be consistent?  That's the only point there is really. Without assuming any particualr significance to any of it, I still do have enough of a sense of my own self to want to chronicle some of the things that float through my life. If nothing else, it helps me reflect on matters without expecting any conclusion (people are excessively hung up on conclusions, I think) and it also serves as a rather useful archive of things that have interested me.   Narcissism, in other words. That's really all there is to it. Spare me the drivellings of further profundity.

I had fun with that third part because I wanted to make it a kind of can't-put-it-down joy ride. Because City of Saints generally has a slower pace, some people don't realize I can write that kind of stuff.   JeffV   I would say he proved his point!

Anyone who gets a little tired of it all is obviously far too stuffy and serious and has their head stuffed up their rear end. Fine.

      I've been hearing all sorts of good things about Jeff VanderMeer's Veniss Underground, and now that I've read it I can tell you they're all true.   Perhaps the nicest thing about the book is it's brevity, for a book that broadly falls into the fantasy genre. At just about 200 pages, it's an elegant, economically written tale that sparkles with ideas, images and yes, even, erudition. There are various literary and mythical references, but it doesn't really hurt if you miss a lot of them. The story is strong enough on it's own.  The core story is that most hackneyed of genre devices - the quest. It traces one Shadrach's descent into the underworld to rescue his beloved, and then (literally) into the belly of the beast to avenge the wrongs that were visited upon her.   That's as far as the cliché goes, though. The setting, to begin with, is not some mediaevalist middle earth analog - it's a grim, intricately nightmarish far-future. The dark underworld is populated with ghastly creatures - all of which are the creations of Quin, an insane, brilliant genetic artist. Shadrach's beloved, Nicola, no longer returns his love. Quin himself is not unambiguously evil - he is cruel, sadistic and supremely twisted in a manner that Salvador Dali would have applauded, but it is hard to tell if his basic motivation - to replace the human race with something new - can be described as intrinsically evil.   The story is superbly constructed - it is divided into three sections, each longer than the previous one. First, we hear from Nicholas, second-rate struggling artist and Nicola's twin, in the first-person. Then we meet Nicola herself, in an unusual and unusually succesful second-person narrative. Finally, Shadrach, yes, the third person and in third-person.  It may all seem very clever-clever, but it in fact works quite seamlessly.   The book is quite nerve- wracking at times - certain scenes are not for the weak of stomach - and yet, capable of oddly whimsical invention at others. There are scenes of utter horror and moments of total brutality (Shadrach discovers that Nicola has been captured by Quin when he visits an elderly client of Quin who is wearing Nicola's transplanted eye and hand). And yet, the prose is so smooth and compelling, you have to read it all.   In fact, this was the first book in a long time that I stayed up all night to finish. It was also my biggest lit-kick since Eco's Baudolino.   Go get it and read it.

      Well, I finished the Ramsey Campbell book. The ending was a fairly standard 'the horror still lurks' sort of affair, which I found a bit disappointing. The book itself was rather well written in a very restrained, straight forward manner. After wading through all that King and Koontz in earlier years, it was nice to read some brit horror for a change, though I'll have to read some more Campbell to really form an opinion on him. It does seem worth it though, especially since his books are available second-hand at Blossoms', so it's cheap at that.  I've been going a bit slow on the Ian MacLeod, counting on the more easy-reading Gregorian and the much awaited Asimov memoirs to tide me through the week. Tomorrow is Christmas, and I intend to get back to MacLeod then as I sense it is a book that deserves (and will probably demand) long hours of dedicated attention.  I've been listening to some music too, not new but new to me, thanks to the Prem and the Khandige. More on that later.

      Books. Where would I be without them? Probably just staring at FTV, fondling my gonads and stuffing my face with snacks all evening, every evening. I'm sure it's my bookwormishness that has prevented me from becoming an alcoholic, a drug addict or a particularly social animal. I'd just rather finish the book I'm reading, thank you very much.  So what am I reading?  Right now:  Ramsey Campbell: To Wake The Dead. Horror. A slow build-up, but oddly compelling reading. Lots of erudite back-story thrown in with all the usual occult freaks popping up in various references, Crowley, Mathers and of course the grim, grasping ghoul himself, the one-balled Fuehrer and his bizarre superstitions. My first horror read in a while. Perhaps I shall try some more Campbell after this. They're pretty cheap, second-hand.  Joyce Ballou Gregorian - Castledown. Fantasy. I read and enjoyed the first volume, The Broken Citadel, nearly 4 years back so it's nice to read the continuation. The book was written in the 70s and more or less free of the post-Eddings Tolkien-pastiche that has infested much contemporary fantasy, although the story does use the rather common trope of a person from 'our' world being transported to a fantastic other world. It also has a lot of names of various important figures that I can never remember properly or associate with the right person unless the title is mentioned, a problem I have with a lot of fantasy. Still, a rather good read, though nothing exceptionally breath-taking.  I.Asimov - A Memoir - A volume of autobiographical essays by the good Doctor. A sort of summing-up at the end of a long life. Smooth reading, illuminating and moving in turns.   Ian R MacLeod - The Light Years - I've just started on this. So far, the writing is quite brilliant.   I recently finished The Phoenix Exultant by John C Wright. It did not thrill me as much as its predecessor, The Golden Age. Over a larger canvas, the limitations of Wright's writing and his vision are becoming rather too obvious. The dialogue, in particular, between Phaethon and Daphne is quite cringeworthy at times. Nevertheless, Wright is still a new SF writer to look out for, if not quite the new master I'd expected on the strength of his first book.

      So.  I'm stumbling through everything I have to do. Work is just a shade short of hectic and rather unengaging at that. It seems that a larger than normal percentage of my working life is getting tied up in bullshit corpoRAT manueverings. Perhaps that's the way it plays out as you get on in a profession.   It's just that there is an overdose of the software industry ethos in the place where I work - a system where everything has to be documented and follow a project timeline. I'm sure that works beautifully for the code geeks. It doesn't work for me. All I need is a brief I can build from and a deadline I can miss. Everything else is superfluous.  I'm also disturbed about certain other things at the work front, but nevermind. There's only so much job related whining I can engage in without beginning to feel apathetic towards myself.  It's only a job. It's only a lifetime.

      OK, the new year is upon us and so on. Despite vicious rumours to the contrary, I am still quite a young man and naturally made use of the seasonal spirit to engage in a fair amount of fun and drunkenness.  On Christmas Eve, I met up with my friend Prem for a few beers at Pecos. After a couple of rounds the urge to do a pub crawl came over me. I popped the question, Prem agreed and so it's heigh ho away we go...  We headed down to Guzzler's Inn next. We'd met up there a year back and had a lot of fun parodying Lars Ulrich's facial expressions when the DJ played Nothing Else Matters. In typical I'm-stuck-in-musical-timewarp-this-must-be-Bangalore style, they played that very same song again. We ran through a mug each then headed out to hit the next pub.  In the bike parking outside we came across a drunken woman verbally abusing some possibly innocent bystander. Her voice was loud and very clear and her discourse was peppered with every expletive she knew. She just wouldn't stop. Eventually, the guy lost it and apparently struck her. She lunged back and knocked over a few bikes. Prem and me retreated before any further ugliness could ensue.  We went to Alibi next. It was pretty empty as usual as we perched at the counter and ordered our drinks. We sat through some rather desultory 80s corp-rock (including KISS' 'I was made for loving you' which had Prem visibly squirming) and decided to get out once the first round was over.   Next, we hit Styx. The music here was far more to my taste - they stayed away from the nu stuff thankfully and basically played it safe - Megadeth, Sepultura and that sort of thing, but I like that shit, so no complaints. The evening ended in Johnson Market, with sheek kabab rolls and sudden intervention by Askhay and Amit (who was mentally in Delhi, though).  Saturday night was again fun. I went over to the Totiman's place and we ran through a huge assortment of music (Dead Soul Tribe, Katatonia, Scott Weiland, Sonic Youth, The Pixies, Bauhaus, Jane's Addiction, Kenny Wayne Shephard and Iron Maiden) three quarters of vodka and two and a half Hitchcock movies (39 Steps - very good and Secret Agent - put us to sleep). Aite.   This is where I should proceed to relate the goings on at the big Khandige New Year Bash, but I don't really feel like it right now. All I'll say is, it was good fun, good friends, good music and the Totiman obliged by providing the mandatory episode of drunken brutality.

I've read a lot of good new books, discovered some good music and made a few new friends, too.   I'd like to wax thoughtful here, but you know how it goes. New days, new ways and so forth. it's only a life, but that's really all it needs to be. Cheers.

      An "official" Lost Book is one that is out of print and forgotten or back in print and forgotten. It can be a book written for young adults that is relatively unknown in mainstream speculative fiction (Diana Wynn Jones vs. R. K. Rowling). A lost book could be one that was overlooked by the Hugo and Nebula ballots. Or it could be a main stream speculative fiction publication that was ignored by the general readership. In other words, it has been marginalized in some way.  Interested? Check the site out: http://www.lostbooks.org/

      This morning, I finished William Gibson's All Tomorrow's Parties. The story opens a little confusingly, with the first 50 pages or so given over to introducing a bewildering variety of new characters, some of whom are familiar from his previous book, Idoru. It's only at around the halfway point, when the Idoru herself, Rei Toei, appears, that the story really seems to get into gear. It's basically a sort of millenial tale - info-surfer Colin Laney has a talent for finding patterns in raw data, and sensing centres of change, or 'nodal points'. He feels that a huge nodal point is about to be reached, the biggest since one back in 1911, which apparently is the last time 'everything changed'.   The story is excellently written and once it gets under way, hurtles towards a climax in typical Gibson style. However, too much is saved for last-minute revelations, and Gibson falters and pulls off a rather flat ending. There's an interesting core plot about the future of nanotech, but it's buried too deep and exposed a little too late to really hit home. Pity, because the book could have been much stronger with a bit of revision. Still, I suppose when you're a 'paradigm busting' author like Gibson, editors don't really call for re-writes.  Idoru was a lot better, with it's unlikely but endearing heroine - not the Idoru, but a little girl from Seattle who flies all the way to Tokyo and takes part in all sorts of major events and then goes back home with no one seeming to have noticed!   Major plus points for slipping in a Nick Cave quotation, though - see if you can spot it, if you have the book!

      1. He wrote long, rhyming poems in a sloping hand on sheets of blue airmail paper. Each 14-syllable line was perfectly measured, alliterative and also part of a complex rhyming scheme. He would sketch the premise out in the first few lines and then deploy it across a variety of similes and metaphors until he felt it was time to stop.  At the foot of each poem, he would scrawl his intricate, curlicued signature with its imbedded caricature of a baby vulture.  2. She only wrote poems occasionally.  She would sit listening to 1970s prog rock, framing short quatrains in her head, testing the way they fit the shape of her emotions. She could sing, better than she wrote, and play a little guitar. When she wrote down her poems in her spiral-bound notebook, she would jot down chord names above the lines like asterisks.  The footnotes were the songs she never sang.  3. His poems were scribbled in short, sturdy lines across the pages of an old diary. 4 or 5 syllables to a line. Short and modest, his poems were just short of trite, his emotions interesting only in their intensity. Taken as a whole, his poems revealed a secret misanthropy that his outgoing, gregarious behaviour archly hinted at.   He gave each of his poems a title, something pithy and aphoristic. Read in sequence, the titles formed a meta-poem of terrible grace and power.  4. He never really wrote what he would call poems. As a matter of fact, he never wrote them down at all. He carried these little collections of lines around in his head and occasionally confided them to friends.  Each of these pieces was a perfect miniature, capturing a world of feeling in three or four cleverly formed, lovingly polished lines. Every time I heard them, I tried to sit and write my own poetry. My tired, overwrought phrases always paled in comparison.   He was the best poet you’ll never read.

      I've pretty much decided that I probably shouldn't try and write science fiction, since I read so much of it. It's the old ashtray thing.   So what should I write?  I've always been fairly OK at these little vignettes, these word-portraits of a moment in time or an aspect of a personality. But vignettes do not form a story.   However, I can write stories. I rarely show them to anyone, but when I have they seem to be accepted as valid stories (irrespective of merit).  So what should I write stories about?  The problem is, there are too many options. Too much stuff. Clinging toa genre was actually a sense of safety. But now what?  Oh, boy...

      Oh well. Life goes on. Things are progressing at an even keel, aided by my pay hike. I also seem to be having a bit of fun, unusually so for me. Friday I met up with Shree, Jack and DT for a fairly epic driking bout that ended back in my place with full music and all. Saturday was a repeat with Shree and Jack again and also GK, Sam and Toto.  I would like to say more but perhaps another time.

      I might as well put this up here. A little essaylet on Jack Vance.   I've only read three of his books so far - Emphyrio, Night Lamp and Lyonesse: Suldrun's Garden, but his beautiful prose style and unique world-building already has me hooked.   Style is the first thing that strikes you about Vance - he has a graceful, almost Victorian way of writing, complete with exquisitely balanced sentences, aptly used words and rich, compelling description. In fact, I'd suggest you avoid reading any Vance if you are currently engaged in a writing project - the rhythms of his prose have this very insidious quality!   The next thing that sets Vance apart is his world-building. His worlds are not the complex politico-ecological creations of a Frank Herbert, nor are they based on extensive social or tech extrapolations. Instead, he creates worlds that express ideas, states of mind and philosophical conceits, much like the fantastic metropolises in Italo Calvino's Imagnary Cities.   Vance then goes on to set leisurely, gracious tales in these worlds. His plots seem to be fairly straightforward, as far as theme goes - more often than not, the story revolves around an individualistic protagonist, something of an outsider, who embarks on a journey of discovery and transformation.   His works are both in the fantasy and sf genres, but there is really little difference between the two, except by way of stage-dressing. His SF is best described as galactic fairy-tales.   His books are rather leisurely, as I've said, but if you have the time for them, they can provide you with a truly pleasurable read.

      It's been a while.  I'm having second thoughts on my decision in my previous entry. I think I'll just write and let the stories sort themselves out. Right now I'm tentaively working on new story which may turn out to be a sort of galactic gnostic fable, odd for a non-believer like me, but what the hell, right?   I'm reading a fair amount of fantasy right now, after quite a while. I finished Weiss and Perrin's Dragon Wing after a break, and that has set me right back in the fantasy mood. Fortunately I have some excellent fantasy books by Vance, Erikson and Moorcock at hand, so the reading goes along quite pleasurably.   I also need to re-read Dune now, which should be fun.   The last few weeks have been a bit wild with the whole party spirit prolonging itself and I need to slow down a bit. Time for some quiet contemplation.  I hope.

      It's been a while, yet again.  Honestly, there has not been that much to tell. Work goes on fairly normally - although I need to get a little more into work-head than I have been lately. Been reading a lot of course - some of the authors I've tripped on lately are Michael Moorcock, Jack Vance, AE van Vogt and John Banville. Right now I'm reading a rather cool book of mildy chilling tales by Marathi author Vilas Sarang, called 'Fair tree of the void'. Not much music happening, but on the weekends Itend to go friends' places and listen to new stuff. New to me, that is.   Oh wait, wait. My mother and her husband have finally moved back into Bangalore. Yea. That's some major (and happy) news. Still, I don't seem very locked in to writing about my life right now, so we'll have to see where this leaves the blog. Later, then.

      I have news.   Many moons ago, I joined an online SF discussion forum. Although there were a few literary sf fans on board, the place was more generously populated with movie/tv crowd and fat fantasy followers. However, I did meet a couple of people who were into the written stuff, especially the older stuff. And then, the foremost of these, a Southern Gentleman from the US, whom I shall call Mighty Kveldulf, was banned from the board for playing logic games with the whole notion of Political Correctness. However, he did drop me a mail and we stayed in touch, shooting the breeze by mail or on other forums.   Well, at some point down the line, Mighty Kveldulf ran into a group of amateur film makers from the UK called  urlLink Superteam  and became involved with their activities, contributing inputs on backgrounds, props and so on.   After a bunch of Stargate fan films and couple of smaller-scale films (including a D&D film), Superteam decided it was time to figure out what to work on this year. Mighty Kveldulf suggested a cinematic adaptation of Ambrose Bierce's classic horror tale,  urlLink  'The Damned Thing.  To see if it could be done, they needed to have a look at a possible script.  For some reason, Mighty Kveldulf was under the impression that I could help out, and asked me to weigh in with a script. Always ready for a new writing challenge, I got to work. However, it strick me that my old booze and blues buddy, Jack might be able to help me flesh out the scenes, insane movie buff that he is.  Jack and I went over the story - an excellent, creepy tale shot through with just the right hint of gallows humour - and realised that we'd have to add a few things. Specifically, a frame for the diary entries that make up the climax of the tale, and an opening scene in a shady bar because opening scenes in shady bars are just so damn cool.  Having figured out our treatment, we got to work. Or ratherm Jack got to work. With a modicum of interference from my end, he transformed our ideas and the original tale into a script that we fondly imagine is a worthy adaptation of Mister Bierce's brilliant story.   Then, I sent the script to Mighty Kveldulf and Ian of Superteam. This was an epic undertaking in itself - various oddities of cyberspace ensured that the word document did not reach its intended recipients in a usable form. FInally, I turned to my colleague, The Infragable Ashoka and begged him to turn the damned thing into pdf. He graciously complied, and the resulting pdf succesfuly reached Kveldulf and Ian (who seems to have read it in the tub - good we didn't drown him!)  The upshot of all this is that Superteam are very interested in seeing this project through - with a story as strong as this, quite a movie can be made. The script isn't too bad either!  Of course, there a few things to be worked out. We believe that the story is public domain, but need to be sure. I've asked a friend in the book business if he can figure this out for me. And of course there all sorts of logistics and so forth to be planned out...but it's cool that we've even got so far!  Watch this space for more details. Really.

      That must be me.   I cannot participate in the sorrowful vigils, the touching tributes and so forth being offered to my friend who passed on earlier this week. I feel the loss, and I feel both angry and sad that such a promising life ended so early and - and so stupidly - but I have to move on, you know? Like the old asassin said, (though he phrased it better of course) not all my tears will unwrite a single word of what has already been written in the book of life.   I know that I don't want people moping around when I am gone. It'd be nice if a few of them remember me now and then, but please, just get on with your lives.   All of which makes me wonder - am I actually rather unfeeling because I do not show my feelings - or indeed allow them to dominate my mind beyond what I think is an appropriate, healthy measure of time? Someone recently accused me of living like a man in a bubble. Maybe that's true.   Maybe it's safer and healthier in a bubble.

      A few weeks back, I was fortunate enough to locate a second-hand copy of Cordwainer Smith's only full-length SF novel, Norstrilia.   Smith (the SF pen name of US foreign policy adviser Paul Linebarger) was one of the most unusual writers to ever grace the genre. In my opinion, he belongs to the ranks of SF's most creative literary and conceptual trail-blazers, like Alfred Bester and Theodore Sturgeon.   His entire opus consists of a few dozen short stories and this novel, all of which are conceptually linked within an over-arcing future history of mankind. A future history is nothing unique in SF - Robert Heinlein did it right in the thick of Campbell's Golden Age, and many other authors, including James Blish and Larry Niven have weighed in with their own future histories.   However, Smith's future history is conceptually the opposite of these, even though it shares the same sweeping expanse and sense of extraploation. Rather than chronicling our outward journey to the stars, Smith examines a far-future human race attempting to rediscover its own humanity.   Smith's style is again unique in SF, and elsewhere. He grew up in China, and his knowledge of Chinese writing found expression in a number of unique literary devices, such as the masterfully ironic preface to Norstrilia that outlines the plot - and then adds that the details follow.   So what is Norstrilia about? To give you a complete background, I'd have to summarise nearly all his short stories first. Suffice it to say that Rod McBan has just inherited the biggest landholding in the planet called Norstrilia - Old North Australia - where ten-ton sheep secrete an immortality drug, called stroon. In a world of telepaths, McBan's own mental powers are wildly erratic and largely dormant. Hounded by powerful enemies, he turns to an old family computer for a way out. And what a way out it is! In one crowded night, McBan, aided by the computer, performs a series of financial maneuvers that make him the richest boy in the universe, and the owner of Manhome, Old Old Earth itself.   He now flees to Earth where he finds various forces working to either preserve or exploit him. Anyone who has read the short stories will have a chance to revisit several old friends here, including C'mell the beautiful cat-derived girly-girl.   The story of how McBan escapes his foes and returns to a safe, prosperous life on his home world encompasses a wealth of fascinating details that play on some very large topics, including the ultimate fate and nature of humanity.   Those details are why you should hunt this book down and read it for yourself - there's the sheer inventiveness - at least one whole new idea each page - the marvellously original and idiosyncratic prose style and, most of all, the memorable characters. There are few SF novels that bear such a weight of literary and conceptual excellence - and are still such  fun  to read.   Unavailable for long periods of time, the book is now available in its entirety in at least two current editions I know of - one from Gollancz and the other from the NESFA press.

      The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility) was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003.  During its 2.5-year mission, Spitzer will obtain images and spectra by detecting the infrared energy, or heat, radiated by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 microns (1 micron is one-millionth of a meter). Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground.   It's already sending in exciting new data that's making headlines in the space-related news services I subscribe to. Among other things, the data collected by Sptizer will be used to help understand how galaxies, stars and planets are formed.   Here's the official link:  urlLink Spitzer Space Telescope

      Well, the last half year or so has been quite an interesting time for me, as far as reading goes. I started out quite burned out and contemptuous of the whole epic fantasy scenario, and quite an SF hardliner. Over the months, I've had to moderate this opnion, having read several rather good works in this genre thanks to recommendation from online acquaintances. It's interesting how much the world of forums has made a diifference to my bookwormly ways. I know very few people in real life who read much of either science fiction or fantasy, but online I've found communities with equally dedicated fans of these genres, from all over the world. I've had the chance to trade opnions with readers from UK, the US, Australia, various Scandinavian countries, Australia, and closer home as well - the Phillipines for one, and even Pakistan. Fancy that.   Of course finding a suitable forum that largely gels with my own intersts, or at least the level at which I like to discuss them does take some trial and error, and I've found that a combination of several forums works best for me. I go to at least three broad-based sf/f forums, which have differing emphases between the two genres, and in some cases, a secondary focus on horror as well. Whether they have huge memberships in the 1000s with at least a few hundred active posters or a tight citcle of about a dozen memebers, I've fixed on these communities because they do seem to have members who have funny habit of introducing me to authors I have not heard of, or considered, before. I also go to one sf-only forum which is regularly frequented by only 4 of us, but all 4 are dedicated (obsessed) SF bibliophiles and the level of discussion there is most insightful and informative.   There are a few other forums that I visit only occasionally - either forums centered around a particular author, that I visit when a new book is out, and more general forums that are largely overrun by the franchise-fiction and tv/film fans, but can throw up an intersting post or two at times.   That's a lot of reading - and writing - but it has actually opened doors to new books for me. It's also garnered me a set of online friends, that I shall probably never meet face to face, but have a real sense of connection with. It's heartening to note that I also have an equal or larger number of real life friends, but I do value these faceless contacts through the net - sometimes th ewords we share can be as good as any other form of interaction.  Naturally there have been less positive moments. I have never been trolled on a forum where no one personally knows me (odd, huh) but there have been topics and opinions that have pained or offended me, particualrly the ones that relate to real-life politics or events. I have learned to take these in my stride - online, all you have to do if you don't like what's being said is to close the window.   I've also found that, sitting here in India, I am often as up to date or more so on certain things than people in the West. A number of people I know in the US, for instance, are only just starting out on certain books that reached me much earlier, as India recieves British editions of most books.   Erm...so what is all this leading up to? Not much really. Just rambling a bit on the online forum experience. Do you need a conclusion? OK - tread carefully, and remember to leave time for real life, too.

      Incidentally, I never did mention what I finally thought of  House of Chains  by  Steven Erikson , so here's my post-analysis as posted on the various forums I frequent (spoiler warnings apply) :  I've just finished Erikson's House of Chains. It was quite a read, not the very strongest in the series so far, but particularly notable for its depiction of Karsa Orlong, and the amazing transformations he goes through. This character starts out as a rather despicable barbarian raider, and through a series of amazing reverses and experiences transforms into something much bigger. It is hard to ever really like him, but by the end I felt a certain awed respect in his eventual path.   Other elements of the story followed the more usual course of these books with the Malazan Empire besting yet another adversary. This time however, there was no grand moment of victory for the Malazans but a sense of compassion for the defeated, especially the former Malazan lass who became the leader of the rebellion.   Like the other books in the series, it's loaded with sub-plots and mystification, which is an Erikson trademark. The book delivers a satisfactory resolution as a stand-alone, although I doubt you'd really want to read it without following th erest of the series through. Erikson's handling of romance continues to be his weak point, with the relationship between Lostara and Pearl merely annoying me.   A worthy contribution to this series. I've been on an Erikson marathon for a while now, and I won't deny that I am quite glad to take a break but I do look forward to that mmpb of Midnight Tides hitting these shores sometime soon.

      Well the paycheck just hit home, so I've picked up some new books.   These include:   Michael Moorcock's Multiverse   A comic series from DC/Bertigo. Written by Moorcock himself, art by three awesome comics talents: Walter Simonson, Mark Reeve and John Ridgway. A complex and fascinating story, might be a bit confusing for Moorcock newbies.   Jack Vance -  Tales of the Dying Earth   The Fantasy Masterworks edition, includes The Dying Earth, The Eyes of the Overworld, Cugel's Saga and Rialto the Magnificent. These works seem to be quite central in Vance's opus (and discussions thereof) so I'm glad to have them at last.    Felipe Fernandez-Armesto - Civilizations   A book that suggests that a far more relativistic definition of civilization is required since most existing definitions are sadly biased by the historians' own background. The not-too clearly elaborated premise is that civilisations can be rated or evaluated on the basis of ther erelationship with their environment. Most of the book consists of comparative studies of different civlizations in similar environment, which in itself is thought-provoking and informative enough to be worth the price of admission, although I am not yet certain exactly what the central premise is, practically, beyond what I've already mentioned.Less than halfway through though, so it may become clearer.   Martin Rees - Our Cosmic Habitat   Looks to be a good book on cosmology. Havent yet started on this one.  Now check this out:  urlLink  Real Black Holes Discovered By Virtual Astronomical Observatory

      Oh well. Another weekend gone by. A rather quiet weekend, wherein I slept a lot, watched a lot of tv and read a bit too. I finally got to watch a couple of episodes of  Lois and Clark  (it hasn't aired in this part of world before - 10 years seems to be a fairly standard lead-time for such things) and I must say it was quite entertaining, with more than a little of the flavour of the early Superman newspaper strips. I shall have to watch a few more episodes to really judge though - there is equal potential for it to get more interesting or just turn annoying. Terri Hatcher certainly bears watching, and I find the emphasis on Kent rather than Superman interesting.   I'm progressing towards the conclusion of  House of Chains  by  Steven Erikson  and must confess that it is not quite as compelling as  Deadhouse Gates  or  Memories of Ice . There's a distinct sense that some things will only make sense on a re-read, and at times the interspersion of descriptive passages seems most untimely. Still a solid read though, and I do hope  Midnight Tides  picks up the slack.   I've also started out on  Downtime  by  Cynthia Felice  , an SF novel published in 1985. A fairly interesting story so far, with a lot of potential to evolve into a complex and gripping yarn of intrigue, mystery, war and even romance, oddly enough. The 80s have been a decade I've largely by-passed in my previous SF reading, and in the interests of developing an encyclopaedic knowledge of the genre I've taken to buying and reading everything mildly interesting I find that isn't franchise fiction, but there is usually some reward in most of what I find and this looks to be no exception.

      Sometimes I utterly fail to understand the popularity of a particular book. I can more or less figure out why people enjoy something like the DragonLance novels, or the Gor books, but I must say I am perplexed at the number of SF fans who swear by Larry Niven's Ringworld books.  The first volume, Ringworld, was enjoyable enough, even if Niven failed to create a really coherent plot, or even to fully exploit the sheer visual wonder and sense of place that a contruct like the Ringworld is capable of evoking (take a loof at Arthur C Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama and compare to see what I mean).   The whole sub-plot with Teela Brown and the Puppeteers' program of breeding humanity for the 'luck gene' is a perfect example of what was wrong with the book - more or less arbitrary tangents that seem to serve very little purpose, except to serve as more or less obvious plot devices. Still, the book was fuelled by a very cool hard SF concept, and had a certain racy wit to it. Some say the aliens were well depicted, and I will concede that they were at least more grown-up than the human characters.   My verdict? A mildy entertaining SF adventure, but not even as entertaining as, say, Grant Callin's A Lion on Tharthee or Jeffrey Carver's Panglor, to name two hard SF novels that no one has ever called 'a classic of SF'.   Now we come to the sequel.   It seems to have been written purely as a response to the numerous readers who took great delight in picking at the structural gaps in the Ringworld. Perhaps they should have spent more time remarking at the structural gaps in the novel.   Everything about this novel smacks of sophomore slump, series-wise. The plot is even more meandering and contingent, with the characters engaging in dull technical discussions and coming to rather unwarranted conclusions. I am no engineer or physicist, but I am at least clever enough to follow a logical argument, and I have to say that most of the big conclusions Louis Wu and Chmeee arrive at seem utterly unjustified by the discussions that preceded them.   The most annoying aspect of the book is the contant insertion of rishatra - a custom wherein members of species that cannot breed with each other engage in sex to seal agreements or release tension.   Something just occured to me. Rishatra is the key to what this novel really is.   Ringworld Engineers was written by Niven to shut up those MIT students who marched the halls of SF conventions chanting 'the ringworld is unstable', by deluging them with enough garbled techspeak to keep them crunching numbers for another decade, and enough (non-explicit) sex to ensure that they would be too distracted to ever do so.   Yes, Niven's sequel was a fitting reply to the only critics who bothered about the original enough to respond. But for those of us who are not virginal MIT students - nah, skip it. Personally, I gave up on the book some 50 pages before the end and have no intention of following up on the series (which has just recieved its 4th installment, Ringworld's Children).   So have I really understood why so many people loved this book? Not really, I've just facetiously dismissed them with a string of stereotypes. But they're my stereotypes and I stand by them!

      His name was Gribbl. He was the foremost elf-killer in all the 3 and somethingeth realms of Pie. Each morning he woke up hungover and unwashed in his treetop nest, fell down to the ground with a great rumbling thud and let loose an impressive stream of invective.   I shall gloss over the rest of his morning amenities as they are too sordid for words. Suffice it to say that, once he had breakfasted and attended to his other basic needs (and very basic they were, at that), Gribbl would set forth, cudgel in hairy right hand, troll-skin loincloth wrapped against wart-infested midriff, dwarf-cranium helm affixed onto the top of his pointy head and hobbit-sole mocassins jammed onto his splay-toed feet, a song on his lips and a spring in his step, to slay elves.  The song, by the way, went something like this:   I'm off to slay some elves Coz they won't slay themselves The poncy little queers I'm the one they fears I'm off to slay some elves I'm off to slay some elves  The tune is rather hard to describe, but employs several discordant intervals and is an example of the highly sophisticated post-modern compositional skills many rough woodsmen of Pie exemplify.   The elves were the last of the non-human races forced upon humble Pie by the Elder God Drear, in an aeon long past. The dragons were the first to go, slain by the Knights, who in turn were dispatched by the numerous trolls, ogres and other sub-human creatures of thick skin and bestial ferocity created by Drear and his Dreary Spawn.   By this time, the woodsmen had detected a healthy trend in what was going on. 'Bump off the dreary races, and we can get on with baking our own Pie our own way,' they figured with the succinct, direct thought patterns of their pragmatic ilk. So they hurtled into the fray, sending Skeptic Commandos to wipe out the dryads, fairies and nymphs, Septic Commandos to practise germ warfare against the bestial beasties, rough cavalry against the unicorns, circus strongmen to capture the various chimerae and mythis creatures and inter them in small colorful cages for the rest of their days, and so on.  The Anti-Drear wars were mightily succesful, and at the conclusion of three months of pitched battle, only one race was left standing - the Elves. No one had ever figured those simpering nancies for a real threat, but the woodsmen decided to pick them off on general principle. It proved to be harder than they had anticipated, simply because of the sheer cowardice of the elves, who ran up tall trees, down deep burrows, plunged into rushing rivers or simply merged with their surroundings when threatened. This was not going to be war, then, but hunting by stealth.  And oddly, few were stealthier than Gribbl.  Some whispered that he was a pederaast, and picked up his guile stalking pre-pubescent schoolgirls. Other suggested that he had more than a drop of elfish blood himself. Most said 'let the lad go kill those elves.' And so he did.   All good things must come to an end, but fortunately, so did the elves. In later days, Gribbl fondly recalled his last elf-kill. 'A gnarled old patriarch-elf it was, almost manly in his advanced years. He was too old to run and too fat to blend, so he turned on me with tooth and claw - yes, those elves had claws, and don't let all those stupid tales of long, slender fingers fool you - and fought almost as well as a woodsman. Almost. He died hard, he died well. But he died. And then he went into to my mid-day stew.'   And so the last of the Drear Races passed, unmourned, from Pie. What next for this wondrous land, you might ask, what lies ahead now that the painful critters of a thousand palsied imaginations have been eradicated for all time?  'Well,' Gribbl mumbles, We won't be leaving on a quest anytime soon, I can tell you that...'   My friend George has made a small . urlLink flash film  showing Gribbl in later days, graduated to cave-dwelling and waving  triumphant fist. Check it out!

      As revealed by one of the erudite posters at the RSJonline forums:   Metal Music was created during World War II. `Twas created by the rebelious nature of teens... MEtal Music is a symbol for anger, voilence.... but there is a sub-genre of metal which stands out of these its know as Melodic Metal which unlike other types of metal is much more soothing..  Metal also shows da fight against Gods n stuff like that..   So now you know.  And knowing is half the battle...

      You can never be too careful with words.   Sometime back, I described Michelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel as murals. I was recently corrected - they are, in fact, frescoes. I'd mentally classified both terms as synonyms meaning 'painting on a wall'. In fact, a fresco is specifically a painting made on wet plaster, while a mural is any large painting or photograph applied directly to a wall or ceiling. I could beg off and say that it is the English language's own fault for having so many words in it that mean nearly the same, but I shall instead take this as a stern admonition to Be More Careful.

      In which your humble pal JP waxes profound on Richard Matheson's vampire classic, I Am Legend.  If Matheson's The Shrinking Man put some in mind of Kafka's Metamorphosis, this book reminded me most of Albert Camus' The Outsider. In both, the protagonist pays the ultimate price for being different from the dominant society around him. I'll venture a bit further to say that Neville's experiences in the book are analogous to those of everyone who attempts to follow a path away from the mainstream.   I've spent many restless evenings with the windows boarded up and the music up loud to drown out the endless cries and entreaties to 'come out, Neville'.   Of course, I do not mean to suggest that Matheson meant this book as an allegory for the plight of an outsider in society. But it does relate quite well. In today's increasinly consumeristic (vampiric?) and standardised society, indeed, in any society that has ceased to value originality and diversity, the non-conformist, whether by conviction or nature, cannot help but feel at times like 'anathema and black terror to be destroyed'.   As a book I found it commendably economically written. The beginning is the hardest part, with its slow tracking through the minute details of another night in Neville's lonely citadel. The passages in which his memories of the death of his wife are explored are emotionally painful, as they should be. Neville's faltering quest to understand the vampire bacteria, his relapses into drunken despair, his alternating euphoria and frustration at possibly finding a dog who can be his companion in this terribly lonely state, all ring true in many ways and are depicted in a clear, non-superfluous prose that is a Matheson trademark, apparently.   Also, in a literary world overrun by sensual, seductive vampires it was a blessed relief to see them shown as the creepy bloodsuckers they were meant to be, albeit with a scientific basis of some sort for their condition.    But finally, I think the book's real message, for me at least, is that 'good and evil' are rarely anything more than a layering of social obfuscation over 'us and them'. By the end, it is 'them' who are the majority, and therefore 'good'. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

      There's a sort of battle happening in this marginal world we fans of SF and fantasy live in. Strange as it may seem to you, even this little ashtray has its mainstream and its contrarians. I've noticed that one Gabriel Chouinard has been a rather vocal combatant in this battle for some time, most lately taking the fight to the trenches, as it were, to the forums on SFFWorld, something of a bastion of fantastic mainstream fandom (although the chaps in the SF section seem rather more broadminded and well-read).   Well, that sort of thing is clearly an open invitation to a losing battle. He's stirred things up, and even found a few souls who agree with him (me, for one) but he's no closer to swaying the Masses than before.   Which seems to have lead him, earlier today, to realise (re-realise?) that the battle between mainstream and whatever-else is not one that you fight in the trenches. Evenly matched powers like the Axis and Allies can do that. When you're a member of the resistance, and the lumbering fascist behemoth has taken over your homeland, though, you have to  urlLink take it to the underground.   Vive la resistance?

      The best ideas do come in dreams.  Yesterday, I tallied up the number of books I've read in the last week alone (3 completed, 2 in progress) and felt rather peeved with myself for not dedicating more time to my own writing.   Then, I spent the day reading two very interesting books: 'Civilizations' by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and What Does A Martian Look Like? - The Science of Extraterrestrial Life' by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart.   I suppose the Fernandez-Armesto book got me thinking about the different kinds of civilization that can arise and their relative merits, and the other book set my mind on the strange phenomena than can occur in deep space (I was reading about magnetotori - imaginary creatures, composed of magnetic fields, that could arise on the surface of stars and then evolve to range freely through space, one of many fictional beasties conjured up by Jack&Ian, as they style themselves, to illustrate how life could conceivably develop in non-Earthlike conditions).   Somehow these themes came together in my dreams in the form of a story spark that involved a conception of the cosmos contantly unravelling at the peripheries, while new matter is constantly being generated at the cosmic core, a vision of a Utopian civilization devoid of religious fears and jealousies and the good old explore-and-settle space mission story frame.   Specifically, I dreamed of one particular incident involving three people, woke up, almost instantly remembered or made up the rest and then feverishly scribbled it all down between 5.30 and 7.00 in the morning.  The best part is that the story idea sill seems good to me, and the rough draft reads largely well. All I have to do now is type the damn thing out and start polishing.   And of course, to remember to dream more often.

      Re: the raging debates among us fantasy geeks alluded to earlier, Ursula le Guin recently made a speech at a publisher's convention or somesuch event that bears reading by anyone concerned with the genre at all.   To quote a particularly pertinent passage:   Fantasy is a literature particularly useful for embodying and examining the real difference between good and evil. In an America where our reality may seem degraded to posturing patriotism and self-righteous brutality, imaginative literature continues to question what heroism is, to examine the roots of power, and to offer moral alternatives. Imagination is the instrument of ethics. There are many metaphors beside battle, many choices besides war, and most ways of doing good do not, in fact, involve killing anybody. Fantasy is good at thinking about those other ways. Could we assume that it does so?    Le Guin also adresses issues such as race in fantasy - something that has long troubled me, but that very few Western fantasy fans seem to include in their lists of wearied cliches. When a writer like Jordan inserts a few token races of colour, and gives different races/cultures amusing idiosyncracies barely on a level with the sterotypes of an ignorant racist (Domani wenches are all seductive Mata Haris, all Tairen commoners pepper their speech with piscene metaphors and so on), Westerners seem to percieve a diversity that I find it hard to see, myself. Of course, he at least makes the effort that the majority of genre writers do not seem to bother to. Naturally, a Western writer will tend to set her story in a setting that derives from their own setting in a way. But when that's all that nearly every writer in the still largely Western genre does, it does make one question the supposed fantasticality of it all.   There are writers who really do seem to be adressing this though - Ricardo Pinto has set his Stone Dance of the Chameleon trilogy in a setting that is more Mayan than anything else I know of, while Erikson's Malazan Books of the Fallen span enitre continents - a far more honest way of depicting disparate cultures than Jordan's coy way of imagining they would all pop up in the tiny continent that forms the stage for his novels.   At some level, this issue of race and setting needs to be taken on in earnest, if the fantasy genre is not to ultimately be little more than a collective wish-fulfillment for the western, white-skinned world. If that does not happen, the genre will be woefully irrelevant in the year 4010, when President Temujjin Li of the Larger Sino-Indian Republic takes office as the Most Powerful Man In The Free World...  OK, enough of my mumbling. Over to Le Guin:   urlLink Some Assumptions About Fantasy.

       We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world -- its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world as it is and be not afraid of it. Conquer the world by intelligence and not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it. The whole conception of God is a conception derived from the ancient Oriental despotisms. It is a conception quite unworthy of free men. When you hear people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable sinners, and all the rest of it, it seems contemptible and not worthy of self-respecting human beings. We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face. We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages. A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men. It needs a fearless outlook and a free intelligence. It needs hope for the future, not looking back all the time toward a past that is dead, which we trust will be far surpassed by the future that our intelligence can create.      - Betrand Russell, 'Why I Am Not A Christian'  I'm actually inclined to be a bit less vehement in professing my secular views, but skip the dismissal of religion if it hurts you for any reason, and I do believe that the rest of this passage (from 'We ought to stand up') is one of the most inspiring things I have ever read.   I read a lot of the 'enlightened secularists' when I was quite young, mainly essays by Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell and Isaac Asimov and I suppose that they are as close to a spiritual belwether as I have. Thought I'd share a sample with my audience out there in cyberspace.

      Ah, let's see. What goes on? Well, I seem to be making myself social anathema in certain ashtrays, which, oddly, is something I can live with. Other than that?   Oh, lots really. All in my head, of course. The Fernandez-Armesto book continues to be a fascinating, thought-provoking read. I picked up Greg Bear's Darwin's Children and it is great to see how he has grown as a writer. He is really venturing into Crichton-esque modern-day tech-thriller territory here, but with better science and better characters.   I saw Troy on Saturday. It was an entertaining enough movie, with some visually spectacular moments. However, i think it rapidly slid downhill after Hector's death - somehow, the rest of the movie seemed to loose its narrative kick, relying on common knowledge to tell the story.

      A few days back, I found Jasper Fforde's entire bibliography bundled together for sale at Rs. 525 (equal to the orginal price of each individual book in UKP). I remembered reading good things about the books on Rick Kleffel's  urlLink Agony Column , saw a quote by Pratchett on the cover and figured it was worth a gamble.   A lot of my reading lately has been rather dark - so this is turning out to be a good break. It's a sort of mix of mystery, fantasy, sf and a very British humour (shades of Monty Python, Douglas Adams, and yes, Terry Pratchett). I can't comment on its ultimate literary value yet, but I'm midway through The Eyre Affair right now and I can say that it is dead funny, and hearteningly literate stuff as well.   Which is only to be expected as it deals with one Thursday Next, literary detective. She is on the trail of a dastardly villian who kidnaps literary characters from their books. She lives in a sort of parallel 1985, where the Crimean War still rages, Britain is dominated by a multi-tentacled corporation called Goliath and popular culture is dominated by high literature and art, with gangs of surrealists and pre-Raphaelites skirmishing in the streets, children trading Henry Fielding cards, genetically recreated exctinct species are popular pets, and so forth, in a myriad unpredictable, abusrd and hysterically amusing ways. The story itself is peppered with literary in-jokes, which are sufficiently low-brow for a mere BA Lit sort like me to catch, but do give a nice frisson of intellectual thrills.   The books look like they could be the real deal - good, soiled, intelligent fun. Stay posted for further reports. Or, wander over to  urlLink Fforde Grand Central . Or get yourself a copy, that's always an implied option whenever I post about a book y'know.    PS: Gah, this has to be my worst headline yet. Even worse than the ones I write for a living...

      Starship Troopers is often called a controversial novel. Originally written as a juvenile novel, it was deemed too violent for youngsters and released as a general reading book instead.   The story itself, such as it is, follows the passage of one Juan Rico from a raw recruit, who has signed up more out of boredom and a need for peer approval than anything else, to a proud, competent member of the Mobile Infantry in humanity's ongoing cosmic war against vicious, insectile enemies.   The battle scenes are gritty, utterly compelling and it's a shame that there aren't more of them. However, Heinlein's sole intention with this book was not to create a guts-and-glory sf war tale - this book is very transparently a vehicle for political exposition that may or may not reflect Heinlein's views at the time accurately.   (The book was written in 1959 by the way, and Heinlein's memories of his military service during WW2 clearly contributed to a lot of the vivid atmosphere and the ideals herein.)  One of the first points that Heinlein makes is a stern argument in favour of flogging as well as capital punishment in the context of military discipline. He also goes on to idealise a gruelling training, depicted in loving detail, and its end result in an ideal military man, disciplined and deadly.   However, Heinlein does not just want to turn out efficient killing machines. Rico's rise through the ranks prompts him to sign up for Officer Training school. Here, we get a second dose of exposition. The political system in Heinlein's future earth is militarist meritocracy - only those who have successfully served a military term earn citizenship and the franchise. The system works, Heinlein says, not only because it ensures that only those who proven their commitment to defending the state can vote or run for office, but also because by its very nature it ensures that the very people who are most likely to launch a revolution instead have their energies diverted into military action.   These seem rather weak arguments - what would happen to the whole system if and when galactic peace is achieved? Also, Heinlein had clearly not heard of the concept of civil disobedience as an alternate means to political upheaval. Like any meritocracy, Heinlein's is ultimately flawed because there can be no one universal standard to deem a person to be a fit citizen.   So I don't really agree with all the arguments in this book. But I would not agree with those who call it a fascist work either - fascists empahsise the state over the individual, and even here, it is clear that Heinlein values the individual a great deal indeed, even if that individual has to be a military person to warrant approval.   I didn't really agree with much of what he had to say here, but oddly, I didn't find any of the exposition superfluous - except the three or four pages dedicated to explaining the workings of a combat suit. Perhaps that was just because it is a concept that has since been used much later SF.   To refer back to my nice catchy headline, I'd say this book is both SF and tract - because of the subject matter and the expository passages, it does serve the purpose of building a certain case for the military way of life as the finest expression of human values. On the other hand, if science fiction is supposed to be a literature of ideas, then this book surely qualifies, as a well-crafted vehicle for Heinlein's political ideas at the time. __________________  Addendum:   urlLink "The Nature of Federal Service in Starship Troopers" by James Gifford (PDF)   Heinlein later claimed that he was not advocating a purely military franchise, that civil service also earned the right to citizenship. this essay points out that, be that as it may, Starship Troopers, taken on face value,  does  in fact describe a purely military franchise. So it a case of Heinlein second-guessing himself in hindsight, or is this just a misinterpreted book?

      Reading Stranger in a Strange Land for a second take, I find myself far less sympathetic to the story, the characters and the ideas than I was to Starship Troopers, which is odd, because ST is obviously a book far less in line with my own views. However, I had to respect ST for being a reasonable attempt to portray a particular ideology. And I guess I should give this book the same benefit, but stating that 9 out of 10 rapes are partly the woman's fault,and then placing that statement in a female character's mouth is such a low blow. A writer has godlike powers over his imaginary worlds - and Heinlein is just misusing these powers in an instance like this. Heinlein seems posessed of a particularly nasty chauvanism - he constantly creates women who are incredibly capable and tough, but then spoils everything by making them nyphomaniacs who wait hand and foot on the menfolk. What he admires in these women, I feel, is not that they know so much or are so capable, but that, despite all that, they still 'give'.   Of course I'm open to being contradicted and refuted, in detail preferably, on these perceptions.

      As you can see I've taken a cue from Joey's blog. A little panel over there to the right with covers of the books I'm currently reading or re-reading and links to places where you can buy them. Amazon is not going to be my first choice for this linkage - when it's a small press book, I'll link to the publisher, and when I can find the book on  urlLink Clarkesworld , an excellent independant sf/fantasy/horror store, I'll link to them. Sadly, it is likely that Yamazone will wind up getting most of my linkage.   Incidently, the only user-submitted review of Borges' Book of Imaginary Beings on Amma's Own says that 'the true market for this book is more likely to be found among players of fantasy role-playing games'. Erm...ehhh. Ah.

      They're taking away my city.   Prefabricated theme pubs, which cater to targetted demographics. Fast food and coffee franchises, the same pre-programmed ambience, the same over-priced menu and the same overrrated humanity in every corner of town. Supermarket chains. Everthing is interchangable, everything's the same.   They're bleeding my city dry of randomness, of sweet chaos, of the unexpected.   They're killing me.   Where is my city?   Here it is, here it is, in a creaking, dingy old coffee house, half a century old. The corridor where I smoke my cigarette and drink my coffee. A weekend morning, watching the auditor and the professor playing portable chess. A wednesday evening, watching punters flip through their little booklets, heads filled with horseflesh and numbers. A sunday afternoon, wrapped up in a book. Each time I light a cigarette, the waiter causes another cup of coffee to appear beside me. Lost in a web of words, I suck up smoke and caffeine and keep turning the pages. Two hours later, I realise I've consumed half a dozen coffees, half a pack of cigs. I didn't mean to have so many coffees. At least the waiter has the grace to give me a sheepish grin as I pay up. Once, a girl came up to me here and handed me a piece of paper and darted away. It was a sketch of me, but nude, and had her phone number on it. No, I never called.   There it is again, in a Mexican retaurant that became a Deadhead beer joint and is now a beacon for great music from the 60s and 70s, strange people to drink with, great food and mediocre beer. One day, I was talking to the manager about pubs in general. About the new, swank pubs. He tells me that he thinks a pub is a place for working people to unwind after a tough day, put down a few taps, have some good food, and not go broke. 'The other pub owners are all idiots,' he confides,'they hike up the beer price to pay for their "ambience" and then they have to introduce happy hours to make people drink the beer. In my pub, every hour is a happy hour.' I've met the strangest people here. A Crowley-ish Creative Director who contradicts everything you say even, or especially, if you happen to agree with something he just said. A perpetually stoned software engineer who somehow manages to crack the worst puns you've ever heard, but that's a good thing because the worse a pun is, the better. The manager of a small chemical factory, who organises motor rallies and knows all the best roads to get out on for a real four-wheel drive shock to the system. A heroin-raddled sometime-model, sometime-freelance writer and her string of hapless boyfriends. A chap who organises wildlife treks for bored corporate pajamahs, and spends the time in between trips doing arcane things for Greenpeace. And so forth.   That's my city.   That's the life they're draining out of me.   Those bastards.

      I turned 27 last week. When my maternal grandfather was 27, he was married and already had two children. Two more were born in the next 4 years, including my mother. When my father was 27, he too was married and already had me. My sister came along a little later.   Me, I'm utterly single and, luckily, no little bastards lurking in the corridors. I've been working - for about 5 years now - am financially independant and live on my own. More or less. I do tend to drop in to my mother's place when I want familial company and home food.   What else? It's all fairly nebulous, really. I read a lot, and a whole lot of rather odd stuff. I listen to music, used to play the bass myself and write songs, but that's sort of faded away. I write as well, but I'm honest enough to realise that I have a long way to go in that department. I drink - previously mainly beer, lately more of whiskey. I smoke too many cigarettes and too little ganja. I like comics. I love cartoons, kiddie shows and wildlife documentaries. I have some friends. Not a whole lot, but a really good set.   Most of what makes my life worth living is really in the mind, my thoughts on the various inputs that crowd into my consciousness, this ongoing construct within my head. Sometimes things come together and I have a neat idea. More often, it's just the thrill of the chase.   All, in all not a bad way to be. Here's to the next 27 years...

      (In which JP takes a halting step towards defining his terms.)   Challenging Texts.  OK, this is a rather vague category - Winnie The Pooh was a supremely challenging text when I was 3, after all. I was basically thinking of the notion of books that pose a  challenge to the reader, in the sense of textual quirk, or layers of meaning, or narrative experimentation, and the like. I'm putting this list together in fits and starts - of which this is the first - as a first step towards figuring out what I mean by challenging texts. Step 1: Cataloguing.   William Burroughs has to come first. I've read Junky (hard-boiled reporting, but with all the themes he later expanded upon), Naked Lunch, The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded and My Education: A Book of Dreams. I recently got hold of The Western Lands. I love the frenzied cut-up technique of Naked Lunch and the books around it, the sudden bursts of relatively lucid but utterly surreal narrative that occasionally surface out of the word stew. I treat 'My Education' as a sort of I Ching, to be dipped into at random. I can't comment on Western Lands yet. Although the books are weird reading, I feel that I've gained a lot to think about for my efforts - a certain perspective on addiction as a pattern for the various ways in which power is exerted, a sense of multiple realities, and of the power of the word, of human imagination, to transform.   Then there's Italo Calvino. I picked up Invisible Cities when I was a schoolboy, because I'd enjoyed reading of Marco Polo's travels. Boy, was that a head-trip. It infected me with a certain way of looking at cities that has never left me. I believe the every city is the aggregate of the millions of individual cities that each citizen inhabits. You don't just live in a city - you actively create your own specific city within the urban sprawl. This was followed by Cosmicomics - these would be classic sf short stories in a parallel world - and The Castle of Crossed Destinies.   Lewis Caroll, for sure. Wonderland was fun and freaky - ooh, mushrooms and bongs! But Through the Looking Glass really blew me away, and nearly lured me into learning to play chess.   OK, coffee time, more later. If you have any light to shed, please do click on that little comment link below and give me the benefit of your wisdom. And I say that with no sarcasm.   Promise.

      Jeff Noon's Nymphomation is an incredible trip. I haven't felt this sheer blast of viral word, sexy data and sheer music pouring out of a book into my reeling skull for quite a while. It's a surreal, gritty, whimsical, morbid, frothy, deep ride through a world that makes mere cyberpunk pale in comparison. It's the sort of book that gets me wanking with 'jektifs in attempt to describe it, as you can see.  What really impresses is Noon's ability to propel a compelling plot and cast while delving further and further into freakish literary quirks, with the first chapterlet of the book mutating constantly at regular intervals, through a sort of Burroughs-ish word-stew into a cyber-Jabberwocky.

      A man wakes up in a familiar place, his own bed, his own house, his own world. He switches the geyser on,  boils the milk, makes tea, sits down with the morning paper.   15 minutes later, he puts the paper down, shaking his head. Which world is this? Who are these people? What's going on? A sardonic hiss from the fridge. Water pipes rattle in smug disdain. He ignores these comments, as is the right of any animate being, and goes in for a shower.   Washed and dressed, he fixes himself a breakfast of puffed wheat and milk, makes another cup of tea. He puts the TV on to catch the morning news. He can understand a the words he hears, the pictures he sees, but none of this is really making sense. A flick of the wrist, he turns the TV off, stands up. A deep sigh, and he heads out into the world.  The same strange place he wakes up to each morning. Never knowing how he got there, or where he'll wind up the next day.   Outside, he stands by the curb, hails passing cabs. Finally, one slows down, the rat-faced driver leans down from his perch in front.   'Where to, sah?'  An address is mentioned, the driver nods and gestures the man into the small, high cabin. Inside, two slatternly young women occupy one of the two benches which are placed opposite each other in the narrow space. One of them eyes him appraisingly and pats the scant inches of vacant space on the seat next to her. The other woman seems lost in narcotic-induced torpor, eyelids heavy and pupils dilated.   The man suppresses a shudder, makes what he hopes is a friendly but dismissive gesture and sits down on the other bench, gathering the folds of his long cloak around him. The cab speeds up again, and he looks out of a small, grimy window with a cracked glass, as the winding, maze-like streets flash past. The man looks away from the window, reaches into the folds of his cloak and pulls out a small personal locum. He flicks into life, and continues to peruse the morning's headlines.   'Atlantis rises from Bering Sea. Consternation in Anadyr'  'Wilhelm Tristan Hitler elected Premier of Greater Patagonia.'  'Representative of the Downtrodden People of NorAm presents petition to Emperor Henry Lee of the Greater Sino-Indian Empire'  'ReRolling Stones dominate charts for third consecutive month'  'Patiala-on-Cambridge loses Hussade Tournament to Palghat-on-Oxford 3rd year running. PoO complains about decline in PoC shierls'  Politics, anomalous occurrences, entertainment, sports...all the mundane objects of record, in order. But nothing quite connects. Then again, he reflects to himself, when was that not the case? Some days, some worlds, are just a bit stranger than the others, that's all.  The lackadaisical woman has been preparing a chillum all this while. With a surprisingly graceful gesture, she ties the ssafi to the mouth piece and offers it to the man. He nods politely, accepts the chillum and cranes his neck across the small gap as the other woman strikes a match and assists him in lighting up. He sucks hard, causing great clouds of aromatic smoke to fill the cabin. Coughing slightly, he releases the mouthpiece, exhales further volumes of smoke, and passes the chillum to the first woman, smiling politely.   He returns to his perusal of the headlines. Only, now everything is black and white with thick outlines and flickers from time to time. He cocks an eyebrow, puzzled. Perhaps just the influence of the smoke, maybe something more...  Outside, a distant rumbling resolves into the sounds of a riot. A resounding impact, as if of a very heavy object being dropped from a great height, is heard nearby, and the cab draws to a sudden, jolting halt. The man pokes his head out of the door, yells at the driver.   'What the bleeding, syphilitic fuck..?'

      In view of recent noises from the White House about Iran, I half-seriously commented on a forum I frequent that that I wondered who else was on America's hit-list, and if it perhaps included The Rest of the World.   A friend replied with this link:  urlLink The Project for the New American Century    The Project for the New American Century is, to quote their site, 'a non-profit educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions: that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle; and that too few political leaders today are making the case for global leadership.'   Their  urlLink Statement of Principles  elaborates on this premise, clearly stating that they wish to see a return to a Reaganite policy* of 'military strength and moral clarity'.  Signatories include Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Dan Quayle, Donald Rumsfeld and Francis Fukuyama, to quote the names I could recognise right away.    Game point, nobody wins. Decline, right on time.  What happened to the dream sublime?  Tear it all down, we'll put it up again. Another Empire?     * The policy that brought you Iran-Contra, among other goodies...

      Blogger ate up chunks of my template customisations, so I've taken the opportunity to muck about with my linkage a bit.   I'm a little overwhelmed at work. My own workload is pretty much under control, but our shortage of designers is seriously crippling me. It's hard for me to commit dates to clients, and to get work done in the time it ideally should be. Why are good designers so very rare?   This really troubles me. I've always thought that design is the more important aspect in the sort of marketing communication we do. Sure, I try to keep my copy clean, crisp and correct, and even creative when possible, but I've noticed that it's possible to create an effective communication with good design and average copy, while the opposite is rather rarer. Visual communication is just so fundamental.   Damn. I hope we get one more designer soon.  On the personal front, my mother's husband has just got a great job in a college in Kopa, near Sringeri. It's about half a day's journey away from Bangalore, and the folks will be moving out by the end of the month. I'll be sorry to see them go, but I suppose it is the best choice. Parents - you give them so much and then you have to let them go.

      What fun. I was actually doing a spot of work at office when something exploded and the power was cut. Crashing sounds from outside. Ran out to the balcony, heard a strange hissing. Hooray, apocalypse.   A little while later, it turns out that someone's AC just blew up and fell off the building. In a few minutes, the power was back.   Bah. Another false alarm.

      I finished Will Self's Dorian last night. It was, all in all, a worthwhile read, and managed to be a bit more than a re-telling of the original story in modern costumes. By casting Dorian as a conteporary figure, and setting his story in a period which includes the outbreak of AIDS and the death of Princess Diana, Self brings Wilde's story into a dialogue on issues like the contemporary perceptions of sexuality, anxieties related to scary new diseases and the everpresent cult of beauty and youth.  Quite apart from all that, the epilogue, with its multipe twists, displacing reality in this fictional narrative not just one but twice (but not quite back to its original condition, I think) is just a brilliant literary headfuck. Wilde would have approved, I think.   There's been a lot of critical ink shed and pixel posted on this book, but I'd recommend Self's own  urlLink article  on the genesis and growth of the project. It's to-the-point, and leaves you to derive further meaning from the book on your own.   Oh, by the way, this book goes under 'fantasy' in my personal cataloguing system: it's set in an imaginary version of our real world, where Oscar wilde never existed and the original  urlLink The Picture of Dorian Gray  was never written.

       urlLink Dinesh Rao  has a good  urlLink guide  to second-hand bookstores in Bangalore on his blog.   To which I'd add:  The man who runs the pavement bookstore near Coffee House now has a store in Shrungar Complex, the commercial complex next to Coffee House. He has a pretty good range of books, similar to what you'd find in Blossom, and somehow manages to have an excellent selection of science fiction. I understand that he's been given the floorspace free for a trial period in which he has to prove that his is a profitable venture. So show him some love, if you're in Bangalore and want to pick a good book, cheap.   This brings me to something that's often bothered me: going by the fact that most bookstores in town have a reasonable sf/f section, and that I'm not buying every single book that they stock, there must be someone out there buying genre fiction too. But they never seem to go shopping at the same time as me - everytime I'm at a bookstore, I'm usually the only person at the sf/f shelves (apart from the odd Tolkien-seeker).   So if any of you are the other people out here who buy and read this sort of stuff, stand up and be counted, damnit.

      I've never really bought the argument that things like the Harry Potter phenomenon are creating a real resurgance in reading habits. Narrow crazes like that only feed themselves, not the overall reading scene. Here's proof:    But with the Harry Potter craze still in full swing, aren't more children reading, and isn't it reasonable to expect they'll continue the habit as adults? According to Ipsos BookTrends , children's books had a fairly good year in 2003, with early lackluster sales jolted by the June release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. But despite the Potter phenomenon, Rappaport said, the consumer base for children's books is actually shrinking, with 33 percent of American households buying at least one book for someone under the age of 14 in 2003, compared with 35 percent in 2002.   It's reasonable to assume the same applies in India. I frequent bookstores - erm - frequently - and while I see a lot of kids buying Harry Potter books I haven't really seen them coming in and buying anything else. Stupid brats.

      The other story I've been working on. Somewhat closer to recongisable sf.  I suspect the use of language maybe a bit OTT, but I'm not sure how much I need to rein that in:     Needles of steel, glass and plastic slice through space in every direction, everyday. Many of them wind up lost, broken on the crags of some distant asteroid belt, sucked into the gravity well of a gas giant, or simply absorbed into the furnace of a distant star. Others fetch up on habitable worlds and the seed-crew lands to start a colony; sometimes they die in a few years, felled by unforeseen hazards, sometimes the precious sentient stock takes root and a new world joins the glittering array.    Sometimes, it gets really strange.    There are whispered tales of ships that fall through vortices in space and time into paradoxical rabbit-holes where up is down and left is right. Tales of ships that slip through the trellis to a still place, untouched by entropy where everything blends together in a super-concentrated singularity. Tales of ships that fly far beyond all known stars and galaxies to oldspace, the farthest circle of this bubble cosmos, where the fabric of reality starts to fade and to fray.    My story is stranger still.   It was my first time out as captain. I’d ridden on missions before, to-and-fro trade runs between settled worlds, supply chains to fledging colonies, rescue parties to communities which had run into some unforeseen crisis, recovery crews for the remains of settlements that had failed. I’d worked my way up through the ranks from cabin boy to captain of my own colony-ship, looking for a new world to settle.   We traveled cocooned in stasis, to shelter us from the cold agony of the empty reaches between the stars.From time to time, the computers pulled the umbilici out of my body, injected my bloodstream with quickening agents and pulled me out of suspension to survey the surroundings. I jacked in to the monitoring systems and ran my accelerated sentience through the datastream anomalies that prompted these resurrections.   I was the human agent to make the human decisions to stop and explore. To turn and run or to press forward; decisions which can never be turned over to machines, no matter how sophisticated. I’d already diverted us from a score of dead ends, chosen the more promising branch on a dozen cosmic crossroads, and then subsided back into the ageless dream.     This time, however, everything was different. The data that I was being fed was either anomalously rich or disturbingly empty; I could not make out which. Baffled, I accessed further input streams and found the same paradoxical pattern. At last, I activated the external monitors and gazed, amazed, at a planetary surface where none should have been.     We seemed to have fetched up on some strange new world that was confusing the senses out of my machines. Stirring out of my pod, I drifted through nutrient fluid to the sphincter, which ejected me into the command section. I showered briefly, pulled on overalls (standard grey, with a small seedling-and-stars motif on left chest) and sat down at my console. I pressed buttons, called up surveillance records and guided cameras and samplers through exploratory routines.     Slowly, the flow of data began to subside into intelligible patterns. Gravity: .9. Atmosphere: Present, earth-like with a somewhat higher proportion of nitrogen. Native life forms: single-celled organisms detected. I ran through checks and counterchecks, but the results seemed determined to remain stable after the initial chaos, although much was still unclear. My immediate surroundings seemed to be a hospitable enough terrestrial environment. Beyond a certain point, my instruments failed. I could not discern the overall mass of this world, the star it orbited, the solar system it inhabited, nearby stars, or even the usually omnipresent expanse of space itself.     I sighed, and closed my eyes to distance myself from my confusion and think things through. When I opened them, still confused, the data had increased. They seemed to hint at a planetary mass in the range of a regular M-type planet, some orbital data (tilted axis – there would be the familiar seasons and climatic variations). Still no signs of a star, but the vista outside seemed sunlit. Shaking my head in wonder and dismay, I knew I was about to take a gamble. I slipped on a radiation suit and a breathing kit, and then programmed the ship to take off and retreat if I did not return within a stipulated time. My throat was dry, and there was a fluttering in my stomach as I stepped out of the airlock and down the dozen steps to alien soil.

      This is an overly simplistic point, and one that I myself would argue against in most contexts, but my long streak of only reading sf and fantasy is beginning to seem like a sustained flight from 'reality'. While I'd argue that a lot of what I've been reading is actually a commentary on reality, through a skewed view, I feel the need to catch up on my non-genre reading, which I've shamefully neglected lately. There's a new Martin Amis novel I want to read, a recent John Banville novel that I missed entirely, and several authors including Thomas Pynchon, Arturo Perez-Reverte and, oh, scads more, that I've been wanting to explore but haven't for too long.  In any case, I've often believed that some of the best fantastic literature I've read - Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, Martin Amis' Time's Arrow, Russel Hoban's Pilrgermann and more - lies outside the acknowledged sf/f field.   Basically, I want to read something interesting and challenging that does not partake of the stock figures and settings of sf/f for a while. I guess Jeff Noon's Nymphomation set me off on this trend, and Will Self's Dorian as well. Each of them had enough invention and speculation to satisfy a hunger for the fantastic, but neither would usually be read by a genre fan. Which I think is much of a mistake as the average mainstream literary reader's failure to engage with worthwhile genre material.  So I'm basically taking remedial steps to avoid the ghetto-ization of my intellect. Wee-hawww.

      Here's something I heard of on littlemissattitude's blog: The Rev. Scott Breedlove, pastor of The Jesus Church, Cedar Rapids, Iowa in the USA wanted to hold an evening of book burning and devotion for his flock. The Fire Department weren't keen on the notion, so apparently they just threw the offending matter into garbage cans and lit candles.   As lma goes on to comment,    Apparently, CNN thinks that the story here is that the fire department wouldn't let the church physically burn the books.  That isn't the story at all, as far as I can see.  The story here is that people are still burning books in the United States of America ("Land of the Free and Home of the Brave"?) in the twenty-first century and, further, that the fire department was suggesting alternative ways to destroy materials that the church finds offensive.  Fra Savonarola would be proud.  So would Hitler.  They both burned books, art, and other things that they did not approve of.  Things that would, oh, tend to make people think, make them feel.     "I joked with the guy that St. Paul never had to worry about fire codes," Breedlove is quoted as saying in the CNN article.   Another Breedolian gem: Breedlove said he knows many people recoil at the notion of burning books. But, he said, "I would say that our society has come to a point where there are a lot of things we say we don't do anymore that maybe we should be doing."(From  urlLink here.)

      My friend urlLink  Prem  is involved in something rather awesome: the  urlLink  Place Project . Initiated by Spanish design firm Vasava, the project gives specially chosen deisgners from all over the world about 10 pages in which to create anything at all that encapsulates their relation ship with the environment they live in. 36 designers, east and west, are involved in thios project and Prem's one of them  I had a chance to look at contributions from deisgners in Europe and South America, and Prem's own contribution. There's some fascinating stuff here - the open brief seems to have really challenged the participants into finding uniquely idiosyncratic ways of communicating visions of their surroundings.    The press release says it a bit more fancily: 'PLACE is a creative and audiovisual research project that seeks to extract and bring to the surface the creative force of the individual in a dominant culture that has been homogenised to the point of sterilisation. It is a barometer of contemporary creation and also an instrument for measuring and thinking about how we are building our history.'

      John C Wright, SF writer and semi-pro windbag on the importance of reading the classics, and the irrelevance of Eastern thought to the West, or indeed, the modern world:    The advantage of reading the Great Books, is that you will know where your thoughts are rooted. You will be like a man with memory in an age of amnesiacs. When everyone around you talks as if the present generation invented war and peace, love and hate, and discovered the sexual process, you alone will recall that the world existed before AD 1968. The reading list for St. John's is available on the Internet. Here it is: http://www.sjcsf.edu/academic/curri8.htm Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not.   Should there be non-Western Civilization entries on the list? The answer is no. There is hardly enough room as it is on the bookshelf of a student, or in the brain of a student, to give the works of our own civilization and culture an honest examination. Understanding the work of strangers is a leisure; understanding the work of one's own life and legacy is a duty. We live in an age where our next generation has been raised in appalling ignorance of our civilization, and whether they will be able to pass it intact their children is in doubt. Now is not the time to neglect our forefathers further. Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not.   Take a look at today's newspaper. You might see a debate about the justice of the war in the Middle East. The notion of the "Just War" that frames the debate was invented by St. Thomas Aquinas, based on Aristotelian thought. Familiarity with these root ideas deepens an otherwise shallow understanding of the debate. In contrast, Sun Tzu's theory of warfare did not affect Aquinas or Machiavelli or Clausewitz, and does not influence the theory or practice of warfare in the modern West. Reading the Bhagavad Gita or the Book of Five Rings, the Shahname or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, will add nothing to the student's understanding of the debate. Even in China itself, the main tension is between the ideals of Marx and Adam Smith, two Western men. The student riot and massacre at Tiananmen Square were not caused by a dispute over the ideas of Mencius or Xunzi And so likewise for all the great issues of our day. Our debates are always framed in terms of individual rights, the sacredness of human life, the duties a patriot owes his city. These ideas are from the Enlightenment, the Middle Ages, or from Ancient Rome. The notions unique to the East, Dharma and Karma, the Four Noble Truths, the Middle Path or the Way of Heaven, deepen no understanding of a Western discussion.    I'd say that the situation he describes so well IS the problem. Perhaps if the West had spent less time shoving its own ideas and values on us unwashed pagans, the world wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe it's time to seriously see what other cultures have to offer the overall human discourse. Maybe I shouldn't be wasting any more time reading books by people who think my culture is marginal and irrelevant.   Anyone want to buy used copies of Wright's first two books off me? Real cheap...

       urlLink Michael Dirda  has just written an interesting  urlLink article  that looks at the dumbing-down in American reading habits. It's part of an ongoing dialogue on the 'death of reading' in the US that I won't comment on here.  However, I would like to draw attention to a few passages that resonated particularly well for me. The first offers a definitive, succinct definition of 'literature', a term that is often bandied around and dismissed as subjective or meaningless in debates on the quality of reading matter people are turning to:   A true literary work makes us see the world or ourselves in a new way. Most writers accomplish this through an imaginative and original use of language, which is why literature has been defined as writing that needs to be read twice. Great books tend to feel strange. They leave us uncomfortable. They make us turn their pages slowly.    I couldn't agree with him more. I really don't read to be comforted, to have a pacifier of verbiage jammed into my mind. I look for vivid imagination, of course, but also for something that makes me think, that leaves me with questions that relate to my real life in my real world, that introduces me to new perspectives and new ideas. I also expect to be entertained in the process, but my concept of entertainment does not necessarily coincide with comforting amusement.  That doesn't mean I need every book I read to fundamentally disturb me - I'd say that humorous works like those by Douglas Adams or more recently Jasper Fforde, make the cut because in the midst of all the wit there are real ideas being shared. Whether it's Adams' 'look what jokers we are, really' satire or Fforde's invitation to explore the process of fiction itself in a deeper light, these books have ample literary payoffs, which only adds to the fun.  The sentiment in the next passage echoes so clearly my own reactions to John C Wright's rather blinkered attitudes in the same vein, that I simply have to quote it:     We all need to explore more widely and deeply the truly wonderful books of the past. And there are so many. How is it that I've never looked at Samuel Richardson's Clarissa, the first great English novel, never read Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, never explored Chinese literature at all?  Unless we try to familiarize ourselves with the best that human beings have accomplished, we will doom ourselves to be only half-formed wraiths, scarcely human beings at all.      I also have to agree with Dirda's discomfort with the Internet:    Why persist with Plutarch or George Eliot or Beckett or William Gaddis when you can drop into a chat room or gaze at digitized lovelies ... ? Instead of reading Toqueville or Henry Adams, we just check out the latest blogs. We turn toward the bright and shiny, the meretricious tinsel, the strings of eye-catching beads for which we exchange our intellectual birthright as for a mess of pottage.    Speaking for myself, the net has only furthered my reading - whether through recommendations and reviews posted online or by the act of buying books through e-bookstores. But then again, I've already been conditioned to be a dedicated reader. I grew up in the ambience of books - the rows of books in my parents' and grandparents' houses, not to mention the books in the bookshop we used to run. The fact that both my parents read a lot. The early introduction to challenging and rewarding books that may have seemed beyond my age-group to most parents.  Perhaps for someone who has never been very inclined towards reading, the net can only serve to further reduce that inclination. But the internet is not going away. It's becoming more and more immersive and involving. What can we do about it?  There's something to feel disturbed by and think about.

      I'm scared. Terrified. The hour of my doom grows closer every second and there's nothing I can do to deflect time's arrow. I downloaded a Sleater-Kinney song last night and read an article by Lisa Crystal Carver this morning. I should have known better. I've been infected with the dreaded girl-germ now.  In the Narcognomickon of Abdulla Al-Jazrad, the Mad Arab has this to say of the girl-germ:  'From deathless aeons, in dimensions unknown to mere mortals, comes the direfull girl-germ. It's sigil is the pink heart, and it may be summoned unbeknownst by the most hapless of mortal males with distressing ease. Once invoked, it can not be dismissed by The Conjuration "XILQA XILQA BESA BESA" or any other spell normally efficacious against eldritch powers. There is no cure and no escape. Only pain, madness and the duplicitious release of death...'  Alissthere Crawling, a more recent adept of the black arts, describes the course of this deadly infestation in his Book of Flies:  'The girl-germ passes into your brain through your eyes while you are reading chick lit, incubates for about 6 weeks, sucking up your brain juices and growing in size until one day, with a sickening rending of bone and tissue, your skull is cleaved apart from within and out comes - a girl!!! Her name is BABALON and she is Nuit. Do what thou will!'  I am doomed. Pity me, and learn from my dire fate. I can feel the pressure building, vile forces pressing out from within my cranium...Ssalmani-ia ina bi'sha duri tapxa-a duppira...Ssalmani-ia ana GISHBAR tapqida duppira...Barra!

      This weekend, I also found time to read Jack Finney's 1954 novel, The Body Snatchers, the basis for two movies that I know of. It was a crisply-written, well-paced book that reminded me a lot of works by Richard Matheson and John Wyndham. It has Wyndham's sense of a familiar community being overrrun by horrific events, what Brian Aldiss called the 'cozy catastrophe', and the element of a larger comment being made about an aspect of the human condition within a pulp-sf format that I associate with Matheson's 'I Am Legend' and 'The Shrinking Man'. In this case, the novel can be seen on some level as a depiction of the increasing alienation of modern life, and a dramatisation of the horror of it all. Unlike the more recent movie version, however, the story ends on a positive note, with the ominous pod-people proving to be no match for simple human ingenuity.   Leaving all that aside, it's simply a good yarn, well told. The style is restrained and lucid, and the plot is largely tight and well-knit, apart from a couple of glitches here and there.

      I hate registering with sites just to read content. It's time-consuming, and who wants to remember so many passwords anyway? I certainly don't, and I don't really trust these sites to protect me from spam when I give them my e-mail ID.   The good news is, there's a site that provides a way out. All you need to do it type in the url of the site you want to access, pick up a username and password from this site and browse away.   Pass the word around:  urlLink www.bugmenot.com .

      A good weekend, but very draining.   Firday night, I met up with Prem and hit Pecos. The beer was flat, the popcorn was bland and the music was good, except for an excess of Phish. We saw a surprising number of attractive women - perhaps I need to start frequenting Pecos regularly again. Last I was there, the place was dominated by big, loud, drunken and obnoxious women with no redeeming charms.   Then, Prem's ex-boss from Bombay joined us and we visited Guzzler's Inn as a sort of sidebar to our journey down to The Tavern. That is one grim place. Stag night in the outer circle of hell.  And so we wound up in The Tavern - a far healthier gender mix and a better range of music, extending to some Gomez as well. The Tavern girls had nothing on the ones we saw at Pecos though - just the standard-issue big hair and tiny tops. Somehow the women in Pecos seemed far more individualistic and interesting. These girls seemed like the interchangable starlets from the latest Indy-Pop music video. Yawn.   The next day, after recovering from the inevitable hangover, I met up with Shreekanth, GK, Diku and Satish and generally ambled around Bangalore for most of the day. A visit to Landmark to plan out which books to fling my salary away on next month. Shreekanth picked up a Fripp/Eno CD that was dauntingly abstract. For some strange reason I kept sitting through the wash of nearly incoherent sound, hoping against hope that the riffage would start any minute now. Nevertheless, seems a worthwhile album to explore in the right mood.   Then in the evening, we picked up hooch and snacks and headed down to my place, where my roomie Ralph graced the occasion with his presence. The music was varied a and all good (as they were all my CDs!): Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden, Nevermore, assorted blues and finally Amorphis. The next morning, it was classic rock time courtesy Shreekanth: Thin Lizzy's Jailbreak and some Accept. yearghhh!   So there you have it. A perfect, perfectly pointless and utterly brainless weekend chronicle. Hooray.

       urlLink    Lovers in a Park - François Boucher   &nbsp; urlLink     Brian Aldiss' The Malacia Tapestry is a baroque entertainment, a ribald picaresque. It's an admirable feat of world building, creating a city - Malacia - that exists in a bizarre yet familiar era that closely parallels 17th Century Italy. It's also a social commentary, a fact that might be lost on some, and underscored for others, by Aldiss' choice of protagonist.   Perian de Chirolo is a young, struggling actor seeking to ingratiate himself into a place in polite society, not to mention into the bed of every personable young woman he meets. As the story opens, he seems gloriously carefree and exuberant, notwithstanding his impoverished state. He trades witty epithets with his friends, enjoys an affair with an influential empressario's wife, the acress La Singla, and, apart from some concerns about the source of his next meal, seems quite content with his strivings.   Malacia is a city under a curse, or perhaps a blessing: it is fated never to change, never to progress. A shadowy, anonymous council ensures that all signs of dissidence and progress are brutally stamped out. But you can't keep progress down forever - can you? Otto Bengtsohm, an artisan from the North, has perfected a form of phtography, and is in the process of creating a new art form - Malacia's first photo-play - under the aegis of Andrus Hoytola, a man of prestige and power. De Chirolo is engaged to participate in this pioneering production. In the process, he meets Armida, Hoytola's daughter and pursues a torrid affair with her. They are betrothed in secret, and De Chirolo resolves to find some way to advance himself and be a suitable match for his high-born lover.   That doesn't stop either of them from dallying with any of the other willing partners available, in a situation that closely parallels the play De Chirolo and Armida are acting in - a melodramatic tale of betrayal and adultery. Only, De Chirolo finds himself starting to take things seriously - Armida's love, for instance. At the same time, he is exposed to seditious Progressivist talk from Bengtsohm and his working-class comrades.   As things build to a head, De Chirolo finds all his illusions stripped from him - his ambitions of social advancement, his increasingly idealised love for Armida, even his faith in his best friends. Supernatural visitations and gloomy prophecies by the soothsayers he frequents add to his sense of despair and disillusionment.   The story ends with De Chirolo heartroken and battered, being ministered to by his friend and sometime lover, La Singla. He has been asked to join the Progressivists, who plan a big push in the day ahead, but has not made a decision. We leave him in La Singla's arms as Aldiss draws the curtain on this vivid series of vignettes.   There are some amazing set pieces here - De Chirolo's flight in a balloon above the Turkish camp, his slaying of an ancestral beast, and several visits to brilliant, forgotten artists and scholars, including De Chirolo's own father, in their decaying homes. There's much rich description, sparkling banter and imagination at play in this book.   But what is it about? Does it have a point? I think it does. Not everyone gets involved in revolutions and protests through ideology or even for petty personal gain. Sometimes, the decision is a human one, sometimes you need to have your hearts broken in the most direct way possible before the scales fall from your eyes. We will never learn what De Chirolo's choice the next morning was - but I for one came away from this book with an appreciation for the human stories that underlie the larger current of history.   Parallels - there is something in the tone and flourish of this book that reminded me of M John Harrison's Viriconium Tales. The depiction of a chaotic, smelly city, and the undercurrent of social upheaval reminded me of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station. I know that Mieville is an admirer of Harrison, but I wonder if some of the setting and theme of PSS is perhaps derived from The Malacia Tapestry.
