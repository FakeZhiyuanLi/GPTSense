						                                 Three days to sovereignty!&nbsp; Congratulations,   Iraq.&nbsp; No more dictator, 18 billion dollars pumping into your economy like a fiduciary transfusion, and Coalition soldiers, contractors, humanitarian organizations rolling all over the place getting the water running, lights working, schools and hospitals operating&#8230; No wonder the bad guys don&#8217;t want this to succeed.&nbsp; When Iraq takes off and becomes a viable national entity, it will mean that the spiral of despair in the Middle East will have been halted.&nbsp; The nattering nabobs of nay saying negativity are croaking pretty loudly, but that&#8217;s the natural background noise of gargantuan undertakings.&nbsp; The invertebrates will sit on the sidelines and croak the most while the vertebrates step forward and get the job done.&nbsp; Vote Vertebrate this year!&nbsp;   J        &nbsp;        -- GT        &nbsp;        &nbsp;

						   ( Mandolin ) Pretty straight forward.  By the time I get a version that I'm happy with, my fretting hand is smoked.  I guess it's old age creeping in.  Ha!  Be sure you have  urlLink Macromedia Flash 7  for playback.

						   ( Mandolin ) A rough cut (I'd call it a &quot;mark on the wall&quot; but some of you might call it something else!) at Fisher's Hornpipe in its original key of F.  It's more bluegrass-friendly in the key of D, and more enterprising players jump between keys in more advanced versions of the tune.  Like Ash said to the flying, biting book in Army of Darkness, &quot;Oooo, I'm coming back to you!&quot;

						                                 My favorite essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson is  urlLink Self Reliance .&nbsp; It captures the American character, and places a crown of gold on the Protestant Work Ethic.&nbsp; As we assist the Iraqi people to sovereignty on June 30 th , they should probably give this essay a close read.&nbsp; They should also read this poem:        &nbsp;          Invictus          &nbsp;        O    ut     of the night that covers me,        Black as the Pit from pole to pole,        I thank whatever gods may be        For my unconquerable soul.        &nbsp;        In the fell clutch of circumstance        I have not winced nor cried aloud.        Under the bludgeonings of chance        My head is bloody, but unbowed.        &nbsp;        Beyond this place of wrath and tears        Looms but the Horror of the shade,        And yet the menace of the years        Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.        &nbsp;        It matters not how strait the gate,        How charged with punishments the scroll,        I am the master of my fate:        I am the captain of my soul.        &nbsp;        ---William Ernest Henley    &nbsp;1849&#8211;1903        &nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the grindstone. --GT

						                                 You know, the discipline of having to record a fiddle or mandolin tune does wonders for your technique and phrasing.&nbsp; If you have to hear yourself via an external medium, you catch things that you would otherwise miss just noodling around on the fretboard / fingerboard.&nbsp; Whatever it takes to improve, you know&#8230;        &nbsp;        Another hot day in   Mosul.&nbsp; The Iraqis will have sovereignty soon.&nbsp; Does that mean they&#8217;ll ditch the AK-47s and dynamite for guitars and fiddles?&nbsp; One can only hope.      &nbsp;        The Arabic word for today is &#8220;feel&#8221; &#8211; which means &#8220;elephant.&#8221;&nbsp; As the sage said, how do you eat an elephant?&nbsp; One bite at a time.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get the job done  ,   not miraculously, but incrementally.        &nbsp;        Cheers,        GT

						   Compared to this lad, I'm a Late Blooming Child Prodigal!  Check out  urlLink Josh Pinkham's Website   Dave Sheiber wrote a  urlLink well-balanced article  about Josh in the St. Petersburg Times.  I believe Josh doesn't like the title "prodigy."  It implies not having to work so hard to achieve a high level of performance.  Apparently, Josh has worked like a bricklayer since October 2001 (when he was 13 years old) to master these tunes.  That's admirable, however--having a "knack" for this sort of thing is a big plus.  As for persistence--here's some encouragement for my fellow not-so-young students:  "A plodding enthusiast is more admirable than the sporadic genius."  Not sure who said that, but it sounds good to me. --GT

						        Thanks to some very generous musician friends in  urlLink Olympia, Washington , I've had the opportunity to hand out dozens of tin whistles, harmonicas, ocarinas, and stuffed animals to Kurdish and Iraqi children in northern Iraq.  There are lots of AK-47s on the streets, but not a guitar or fiddle for miles.  That's what I call deprivation.  Maybe after a year of being a "musical Johnny Appleseed," we can make a dent in this problem.

						   In spite of the obvious "Nero fiddling while Rome burned" joke--I'm sure glad my mandolin, fiddle, and boudhran survived the duffle bags.  Early morning and late at night, these cheap old things are a welcome reminder that civilization is worth fighting for.    The tune of choice this morning was "Beeswing," in Bb.  I have a Peter Cooper recording of it, that is helping my intonation.  My $200 Knilling fiddle and fiberglass bow are more than adequate for Iraq fiddling.  I've heard some of the local Iraqi fiddlers, and they tend to stick to the C minorish Arabesque stuff, for some odd reason.  :)  Fisher's Hornpipe in the keys of F (the original) and D (the more popular key) has been a challenge on my Martin Backpacker mando.
