Well Will has to go so it's for girls at home and what are we doing either watching tv or sitting at the comps for 4 hours no one talked lol. finnally the silence was broke at lunch when everyone finally woke up and we had Pizza. It was great we all started singing random songs and stuff it was great lol, we then got back to the tv and comps and stuff ashleys mom then calls and my mom feels bad like shes a bad mom for letting us sit there so she makes us all go water plants lol. After this little project is done what do we do come back in and do the same thing well we had to be quiet b/c my dad was working from home well at 4 my dad gets ff workd and we get so loud it was awesome. We all had dinner yet still watching tv or being on a comp lol. 7:30 my dad starts watching tv and he goes to the music channels lol.

      Hey ok lets see  School started yesterday, same old crap I feel so lonely here it sux I Msr is mad at me ....agian... I stayed on the comp late last nigth but i was the only one who culdnt be brought down it was like i was on some kinda high. Jonah is on vacation Phillip I hope everything ok muahs   v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v The say the world is round, and yet I often think its square So many little hruts we get From corners here and there. There's one thing true in life I've found While journeying east and west, The only folk we really would Are those we love the best   The Choicest garb , the sweetest grace, Are oft to strangers shown; The careless word, the frowning face, Are given to our own. We flatter those we scarcly know, We please the fleeting guest, And deal full many a thoughtful blow To those we love the best  Ella Wheeler Wilcox

      OKays lets see yesterday drove me crazy  Moms new rules for week daysNo phone calls after 8am till like 4 and no phone calls after 10:30...Only comp time when she says its ok and I get extra home work. If I dont change into the person she wants i get everything taken away. =-/  She gives me that BS  Why cant my parents be happy with me? I dont think im that awful of a person. =(  I'm not going back to where I was I'm not gunna kill myself!!! Cutting crossed my mind sadly yesterday but im all good! thank you lord! that alone makes me happy   The scars bring back bad memorys The things I did haunt me The devil was so close I did not know That I pushed God away Each and every day  im nto going back please help me stay on track weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee     haha but yesterday I had Richards silly meeting it hehe    Chasity, abstinence---saving sex for marriageIs not for wimps!...Sexual activity does no make a boy a man or a girl a woman. But sexual activity outside of marriage can ruin a persons life and the lives of others. It takes a real man or women  to make tough choices they won't regret later...to stand up to the presure when i seems like everyone else is "doing it"  Linda Bartlett     But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil its lusts.
