      today i saw : HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE!! it was the shiznite , specially since im harold and parth is kumar. cant wait to see it again. best movie ever . the story of my life. i love it.  after seeing the film we left the cinema and contemplated what we were going to do next. so i made a few calls and we tore the fuck ass out of the cinema lot decided that we had the munchies and kept an eye out for a White Castle. since we didnt know where one was (except the one in cherry hill) so i spotted a burger king and agreed to go there so we tore in to the drive through and orederd pie. it took a long ass time before we got the pie because the lady workin there is an idiot. after chillin in the parking lot and eating pie we burned a little rubber coming out of the parknig lot. i got home @ 12:15 im the morning going to sleep at around 3:30

      the nite before last nite i went to sleep at 5 in the moring and woke up that day at 4 in the afternoon. last nite was great, much better than this nite, i mean WOW. so anyway, yeah me parth and his friend all hung out. i had an experience driving home that day, cuz some moron almost crashed into me while trying to make a right hand turn in the left lane while i was in the right lane. when i got home i just chilled in the parking lot for a while. so anyway i got work tomarrow- i mean today. its both a blessing and a curse that i have to go to work early for a presentation that i get payed to listen to. then i got to work the next 2 days aswell, but then. i get to go to vermont and visit 2 colleges with my friend, will who recently introduced me to wilco again which has been long overdue since they are pretty amazing. so anway it'll be a nice vacation from basking ridge new jersey, especially since its so fucking boring and because of that like half of the kids in this town smoke pot seeing how there is nothing else to do. ANYWAY the song humming bird on wilco's album a ghost is born is pretty damn amazing and addictive. you can listen to it on their site if u have quick time or from me if i like you enough, though i would encourage people to buy it HA. ANYWAY bye bye.

      so yeah. after a  long nite i ended up going to sleep at  in the morning cuz i was tripping over things all nite. i woke up at something like 8 to have breakfast and go back to sleep. i woke up again at like 8:30 'ish to take a shower. we left at like 9:10'ish so we ended up being late and missing the boring information session before the tour. i slept the whole ride over. after the tour, which turned out to be completely useless to me, we left and i slept the whoel ride back. on the way we got some corn, tomatoes, and over ripe watermelon. when we got back home i layed down on the living room floor and slept from about 12-5. when i woke up i had pizza for lunch, then at about 6:30 i had dinner while i watched some dvd's. then i hung around on my pc doing this and listening to Wilco. i feel bad for anyone who has wated their time reading this.
