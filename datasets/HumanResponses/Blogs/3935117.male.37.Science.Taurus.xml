      This morning I was listening to NPR on my way to work. They interviewed a couple that supported George W. Bush. They asked them what they thought about their kids supporting Kerry instead. The immediate response from the mother, the mother for christ's sake, was that they were stupid. Can you believe it?!!That demonstrates to me what I dislike most about many (not all) conservatives. They choose their party over even their own family. They do not try to understand the other side of things. They lack imagination to put themselves into other people's shoes. I'm sure those people would consider themselves christians as well. How is anything the Republicans are doing christ-like? Giving money to close-minded religious organizations has nothing to do with christianity. I am not a christian, but there are some good things that Jesus talked about (or at least the people who wrote the stories talked about) that are being ignored by the same people who "worship" him. It disgusts me.

      It is amazing to me how many people have positions of power, without the knowledge or expertise to hold such positions. If you are anything like me, you have noticed that the people you work for have no&nbsp;clue about how things are supposed to be done. They just plod through their jobs with little forethought and planning and keep the status quo because that is the comfortable path. That is not what America used to be about. We used to be about innovation and constant striving to be better. The climate that our president has created has made it more desirable than ever to try and maintain the status quo. The changes he has made to the world has created a scary place. I am sincerely worried about what kind of world my daughter will have to live in. Unfortunately Bush does not have similar worries. I just can't understand how people can look at that man and say, "yeah I think he is doing good things". It is amazing how people can let political parties (on both sides) turn off their brains. I challenge everyone to put themselves in the position of others, as hard as it can often be, before you make your mind up on anything. Don't just ditto everything your heroes say. Question everything! Be courageous in all your thinking and actions.

      I just discovered blogs today. I plan to use this space for my rants. I am an archaeologist who lives in TX and have several degrees in anthropology. However I often refer to myself as a misanthropologist, because the more I study my fellow humans, the more they disappoint me. Maybe my standards are too high. They are certainly not based on myself as an example. I continue to disappoint myself as well.   Although I consider myself to be a misanthropologist, I am an optimistic one. I actually think things can be changed if people can be taught not to be so self-centered. As anthropologists we are often trained to put ourselves in other people's shoes. Charles Darrow, the famous lawyer gave us the same advice in his autobiography. If more people would heed that advice, we'd be a lot better off.   I don't plan to be always so serious, but I thought I'd just set the tone a little.   Enjoy.
