      I've been spending again this past week.&nbsp; I'm really not controlling myself too much.&nbsp; I bought 3 work shirts already, though I don't buy them if they are over $10.&nbsp; I don't even bother to lookat the new arrivals anymore, &nbsp;just the sale.&nbsp; I've been spending a lot on my prepaid, calling and texting almost everyone back home (and other people somewhere else).&nbsp;  Moving on.... my brother is back here now and he wants to go the casino this Friday. Hay! More spending.... but&nbsp;I just might go. :)  This weekend we're going to go to IKEA and buy a bed frame and bedside tables&nbsp;for me! Yahoo! My mattress will finally be lifted off the floor! I can finally get some sense of having a real room now! Howeve'r, it will be really ironic if I don't get my residency here! HAHAHA!

      Today we started at 630 AM, had lunch at 140 PM then our last appointment will hopefully finish by 615 (if they're not late).&nbsp; This is not a typical work day for me, but it does happen once or twice a month.&nbsp; I really can't complain because this just means we are getting more people in and that's a good thing.&nbsp; I have a 2 hour lunch break now and Dr. Mark is sleeping.&nbsp;  I almost quit my job yesterday.&nbsp;I've been so stressed this past few months that I just could not take it anymore.&nbsp; I ended up crying and telling Dr. Mark to get someone to replace me.&nbsp; He apologized saying that he's has been really stressed too.&nbsp; Anyway, this morning&nbsp;was not too bad.&nbsp; He hasn't found anything wrong about my work, but&nbsp; I guess I'm working better because I got to say things I've been keeping inside for awhile now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's see how long this truce will last. :)

      Almost&nbsp;all my friends here in the coast&nbsp;have either left or are leaving.&nbsp; Their destination.... Manila. The sad part is that not all of them really want to go back home.&nbsp; How ironic is it that I can't go back (even though I'm dying to) and these friends of mine who want to stay here have to? Life is a series of cruel jokes!&nbsp; I swear nothing ever goes according to plan.&nbsp; This week has really been depressing! Even my work is being affected.&nbsp; Not one day&nbsp;that has passed&nbsp;that I didn't do something wrong. It's frustrating.&nbsp;  This is my last week alone at home. My brother is coming back next week.&nbsp; I'm just going to make the most of it because I know the next 16 weeks after that will be really tiring and would try my patience.&nbsp;  I really just wish that my I get a response from the immigration department soon.&nbsp; I don't know what will get to me first...anxiety or loneliness.&nbsp; Oh well, enough of this whining and winging. I just have less than a year till I go on a holiday.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to that!   &nbsp;

      Lately I've been missing home so much.&nbsp; I miss my friends, hanging out in the mall, school, my brothers and sisters and just everyday life.&nbsp; There is so much diversity in our country that everyday is an adventure.&nbsp; I was never bored back home (unlike here).&nbsp; Yet, here I can see the blue sky and the green hills everyday.&nbsp; I can breathe all the fresh air I like and I don't spend half my day stuck in traffic.&nbsp; That is a wonder in itself, especially when you've grown up to the polluted and unsafe streets of Metro Manila.&nbsp; But there is only so much beautiful sunrises and sunsets that can keep me occupied.&nbsp; (A friend of mine who just went home a couple of week ago.&nbsp; One of her first messages to me was that she was dying in the polluted and traffic streets of&nbsp;Manila.&nbsp; I have to admit, I'm not really looking forward to that as well.)  However, another part of me is saying that things back home are not the same anymore.&nbsp; I haven't been home in 3 years (it would be 4 when i get my holiday next year) and a lot of things have changed.&nbsp; Life does go on for everyone, even when someone goes away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, my life would be better if I stayed here and nothing can dispute that.&nbsp; Practically, what I'm earning here now on a weekly basis would probably be my salary in Manila for a month (i'm only on a casual salary as well and not full-time)!&nbsp;Life in Australia is really simpler and easier.&nbsp; But as my friends can say, I was never one to choose the simple and easy way (except when it comes to passing exams! :)).  Well, I still have a few more weeks or months to go to find out what the future holds for me.&nbsp; For now, I'm just thinking that all the options are open for me at the moment and that I really have a say in what's going to happen (this situation can change soon).&nbsp; Missing home is really just normal I guess.&nbsp; But no matter what happens there is one thing i hold on to:&nbsp; it is the belief that my friends will still be my friends no matter how long I stay here and that nothing would change that. For me that is what keeps me going everyday and I'm really thankful for that!&nbsp;

      A lot of people are wondering what i do in the clinic.  Most people have the misconception that i massage or adjust patients.  Well, here is the description. Title:  Chiropractic Assistant Duties:  Reception (answering phones, greeting patients), Appointment maker (book patients in a schedule or call them when they've missed appointments or have to reschedule), Bookkeeper (tally day sheets, wage, schedule payments to creditors), Secretary (i fix the doctor's seminars like plane flights and schedules), Cleaner and I answer patient's questions about chiropractic.      I don't do any adjustments because I'm not qualified to do so. Only the chiropractor can do that.  What is chiropractic?  Chiropractic works on the premise that the body heals itself.  Interference should be removed so that the body could functions at its optimum.  Children are recommended to get chiropractic treatment because birth is the worst trauma that the spine goes through.  Imagine the baby's head and body going through the birth canal with all that pushing and pulling.  Injuries, accidents, not exercising, sitting too long in one position are also causes of subluxation. If interference is not removed it causes the body to develop pains or diseases.  So what does a chiropractor do?  A chiro is a doctor that adjusts the spine to remove nerve interference (called subluxation).  The spinal cord is the central nervous system.  It carries messages from your body to the brain.  If there is a vertebra out of place causing the nerves to be pinched, there is a corresponding effect to the body.  It could be a migraine, ulcer, numbness of extremeties, back pain, etc.  This is the body's way of telling you that there is something wrong.  Instead of masking the pain with painkillers, you should go to a chiro to get to the root of the problem. When a chiro adjust your spine and puts everything in alignment then the body heals itself. The process is long but natural and safe for everyone.  I hope i've been able to explain what i do and what happens to me everyday in the clinic.  It's interesting enough because i get to talk to a lot of different people.  However, it gets tedious and hard sometimes because I can't be friends with the patients due to a thing called "professionalism".  So i'm limited to certain topics and i have to be inventive so i can revert the conversation back to the patient's health. Well, it's thursday night now and friday tomorrow! I can't wait for the weekend to come.... it's just that the weekend is too short.

      This movie was amazing!  A sequel that outshines the first.  I hardly say this about sequels but this one is true.  The story is realistic, special effects did not go overboard and the hero is someone the viewers can relate with.  One of my friends said that Spider-man is a hero who is human.  (Superman is an alien, Batman is psychotic and Wonder Woman is a demi-goddess.)  Money problems, family problems, school problems and love problems are some of the few aspects of the story that almost everyone has experienced and as i said people can relate with.  For me this is one characteristic to really like a movie and recommend it to people.

       I forgot to post this last monday...   Another weekend over and this was one of the better ones. Spending time with a friend while doing much needed household chores was one thing that i never imagined to have fun doing.  Saturday started with me going to the gym, then lunch with sonya at a nice restaurant (yum, yum).  We went home after that and just started weeding my front garden.  Three hours passed without much fanfare then a shower then we went to the movies (the prince and me, though the title is grammatically incorrect,was enjoyable) then mcdonald's dinner (i know it's unhealthy!).  We went home to watch Law and Order : special victims unit (we love this show) then just talked all night and half the morning (we slept at about 4am).  Sunday was spent cleaning the house and then i brought my good friend to the train station so that she can go back to brisbane.  Life is certainly more fun when you have friends around.  No matter how mundane or simple the events.  (Just want to say thanks a lot Sonya!) Another weekend over and it was productive and enjoyable.  i wonder what i'll do this weekend!

      I was talking to a patient today and the subject of looking for a boy came up. She suggested that I put an ad in the newspaper.  Apparently that was how she found her partner.  I thought she was joking but it's true.  They have been together for a couple of years now (isn't that amazing?!).  She said that she got about 50 replies, she went to meet all of them and she found her guy.  I wonder if putting a personal ad is the only way to meet men now.  Are the men all in hiding waiting for an invitation rather than going out there and actually trying to meet girls? Is an ad the answer for all the single ladies looking for a guy?  My friends and i are always wondering where to meet eligible men.  Maybe this is the answer or maybe not.  No matter how hard it is being alone i think i will never muster enough courage to do so.

      Gardening could be very therapeutic. Battling with weeds with one's own strength and winning (taking out roots and all) feels very rewarding.  It's the one of the simplest dynamic one can have with a living species.  It actually seems very barbaric at times with all the grabbing, grunting, bracing oneself and pulling one has to do. The world is centered on that one annoying weed until it is rooted out and feeling very victorious after the deed is done.  However, the chore is not finished till you pull out the next and the next and the one ofter that.......   Life is the same for everyone I suppose. Everyday is just the same as gardening and pulling out weeds.  The weeds that needs to be pulled out may be different or they are in a different spot but the same process is required to pull it out.  We all go through life everyday with little variations but at the end of the day we all feel either one of two things, victorious for a day that has gone well or frustrated that things did not go as we planned that day.  But more often than not, with gardening and weeding a job well done is the more common feeling at the end of the day.  Maybe I should just garden everyday.... :)

      I never thought the weather would be such an integral part of my life.  Everyday the weather would be the first topic of a conversation (or worse the only topic) with my boss, patients and everyone at the centre. Imagine talking about the weather at least 15 times a day.  "The weather is lovely today", "it's cold today", "the sun is lovely outside", "it was a bit chilly this morning" and other variations of the same topic are the words that come out of my mouth or the words that i hear every 20 minutes of my work week.  Is it such a wonder that i look forward to weekends?! :)

      I have recently joined the ranks of the unemployed.  Although I'm in a much better place (Australia is supposedly a better place) to be in this predicament, unemployed is still unemployed.  The thought of not having an income in the next few weeks is very depressing and worrisome.  I have saved some money since I started work, but I was actually reserving that for my trip back home.  Oh well, these things can't be helped.  I'm praying that I can get a job soon and recoup my savings. The funny thing about the whole thing is that even though I'm worried, I'm not scrambling at the moment to look for work (does my lack of focus show now? hahaha!).  I've been cathchin up on sleep, some reading and cleaning the house.  It's actually kind of therapeutic for me at this time, thinking about what I'm going to do with my life while scrubbing the pans or the floor.  I'm going to be actively looking for work next week. Wish me luck. In the mean time, I'm caught up with watching the Olympic Games.  I feel a bit sad that I don't see any Filipino candidates in any of the matches shown here so far.

      Today was such a good day. I haven't felt this happy since I left my landlord last year (she really made life miserable). Today I was laughing and talking and had so much energy. My boss was really so surprised. He was bewildered on my transformation. He told me that he was thinking what came over me. Because that was how I was when he hired me in the start. But as weeks passed, I just became so tired. I also did not enjoy being the receiver of his outbursts. It just became too draining. I did not enjoy what I was doing anymore and I dreaded to go to work everyday. But since I told him that i was quitting, things just fell into place. My PR was granted, then he found me a replacement (i'm training her this week). Hopefully another job will come along as well. However, I really should not feel this happy mainly because I have no sure source of income in the next few weeks. Who would feel happy about that!? I would surely be looking for a new job and praying everyday that my plans will happen. About my residency, I'm still bit undecided about it. I'm glad that I have the opportunity to make a life here, but I still can't see myself here forever. It seems like a part of myself does not want to let go of Manila. But we shall wait and see. I don't think I'm meant to have all the answers now. I'm just being given the answers that I need at this moment and I should make the most of it. I'll be unemployed come the end of the week or maybe next week. It's not sure yet, it really depends o how fast she learns. My boss was a bit sad that things ended this way, and so am I. But it can't be helped I guess. I'll just finish this job the way i did today. That would make it a good ending for both of us. The bad episodes we had could hopefully be left behind and we could part ways in good terms.

      My weekend was very productive.  Friday night was spent at home assembling my bedside drawer. Saturday morning was spent in the gym and the afternoon with friends in Brisbane.  We ate a lot, talked a lot and laughed a lot.  The laughing was mainly due to the movie White Chicks.  I definitely recommend this movie to be watched by "barkadas".  It's a good exercise for the stomach.  Sunday was another day at home.  I finished assembling my bed and bedside table and cleaning my room.  Weekends like this one are rare for me.  A perfect balance of companionship, reflection and pure physical exertion.  I just wish there would be more.  However, it seems like things would change pretty soon.  I just don't know if it's going to be for better or worse.  Just keep on reading my updates.....

      It's been awhile since I wrote on my blog, but I really haven't had the time.  It's not that I'm really busy but I'm finding it hard to put my thoughts into words.  These past 2 and a half months have been really difficult for me.  Aside from my friends leaving, work has been like torture.  I never seem to do anything right no matter how hard i try.  Something always goes wrong.  Maybe it's my fault.  Admittedly, I haven't been that focused.  Having one's life in limbo while being homesick just doesn't help my concentration.  Maybe it's about time that i go home.  How long for is the question... It will really depend on my residency.  Cookie and I were talking one time and we were thinking how stupid we were to want to go back home when almost everyone wants to leave the Philippines and be where we are.  When I think about it, my friends and family are the ones who are really pulling me back.  If they were all here I wouldn't think about going back at all.  My life would have been lonely and unbearable without them, something like how it is now.  All my salary in the world could really not replace the contentment and sense of belonging when I'm with them.  So, should I follow a friend's advice and live here (if given the chance) then just go back home once in awhile to recharge? If I do that will life ever be the same? Would I feel happy and content one month in a year and miserable or just floating along for 11 months?  Or would that one month  a year be enough to tide me over? But if you think about it,  the sense of belonging that I feel  is being part of the everyday life of people that I love.  Sharing life's experiences and adventures (or misadventures) is one of the things that make the bonds stronger.  Being there for only 1/12 of a year to have fun and be a visitor is not really sharing life is it? I don't know.  Maybe this blog is for me to convince myself that I really should go.... I've been dreaming about it as well.  Let's see how much longer I can stand this and here's to hoping that I don't break.
