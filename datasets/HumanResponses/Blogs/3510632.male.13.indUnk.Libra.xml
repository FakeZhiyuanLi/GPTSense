      I create this Blog after reading a series of bile-filled, lying, right-wing, Blogs. At first I thought that this was an unavoidable problem and that Conservatism is always going to exist yet after awhile, I realized that something was seriously wrong.  Most of the Blogs were founded simple out of ignorance and lack of knowledge. They were created by people who believe the lies of Republicans. From politicians such as Bush, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, and other Bush-Administration politicians. Lets also not forget the many Republican Senators and Congressman. All of these Right-Wingers continuously have lied about Iraq, terrorism, Religion, and the Economy. However, the evidence points against them. The facts, the statistics, and the simple truth all go against there lies that benefit their rich friends and themselves. There can only be one reason for this.  The Conservative Media.  They distort the truth and cover up the facts. They are racist, sexist, and largely favor the rich, while masking themselves as people in league with the working class. They talk about supporting freedom and democracy, yet in reality they care nothing about either there of those. They rant and rave about a large liberal bias in the media and how liberals hate America, Flag-wavers, freedom, working-class people, yadda-yadda-yadda. They wear a multitude of different masks, such as:  Fox News, World Net Daily, The Washington Times, The New York Post, The Wall Street Editorial Page, Clear Channel Radio, and Sports in general.  These news sources have large numbers of supporters and people who listen, watch, and read them. They entertain the ignorant, scared, and people looking for simple, political blood. People stomach the rhetoric and lies of the media all the time. The Conservative Media has its knights that it support it. We all have seen them foam at the mouth, screaming and yelling typical conservative talking points. There are many well known Conservative media knight, such as:  Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Mortimer "Rush" Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Brit Hume, Lara Ingrahm, and William Buckeley.   Those are just a few, yet those, along with the others, wield so much political power that they are able to turn the opinions of the public to favor the Conservative agenda. They have created an army of lie-feed, war-mongering, gun-toting, Conservative supporting Americans, many of which who don't benefit from the Republican Party. They are gaining large amounts of control and are taking over the minds of the average media, giving power to the largely corrupt Republican party.  Its time for them to step down.  On my blog agenda, I would move down a certain path in bashing the Conservative Media. First, I would like to prove the Conservative point that there is a Liberal Bias in the Media wrong, because it can be proven that there isn't. Second I would like to prove how the Conservative Media is able to gain such an iron grip over the population and gets such high ratings. Then I prove how the Conservative media is racist and sexist, in which I will follow up were I will tell how the Conservative Media lies, distorts, biases, and does not live up to its values. Overall, I wish to show how the Conservative Media is a terrible concept.  I hope to update my bloc often, yet I might go up to a week until I post my next post, so don't expect speedy service. I also like emails that challenge my points whenever I make a post, and I will try to respond to them.   Well, I hope my bloc turns out a success, and that people realize that the Conservative Media is anything but "Fair and Balanced"  -MC
