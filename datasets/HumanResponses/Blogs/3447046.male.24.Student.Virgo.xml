      So I had my Astronomy 110 final tonight.  I wasn't doing to well in there to begin with.  But, the instructor told me last week that I could pull a low B if i did really well on my final.  So, hopefully, I did really well.  I feel like I passed the final...then again, I felt good on the last 2 exams, and didn't do well at all.  So here's to me hopefully getting a passing grade in there!

      So last night I message my buddy on Yahoo Messenger...I message him with "watcha doin?" and he starts accusing me of hacking his computer.  His excuse was that twice I asked him "watcha doin" while he was logging into his router.  I was laughing for hours...

      Today I had my final exam in History 120...I did pretty good (At least a high B I think).  I don't really like the instructor though.  Bunch of things he does that I don't like.    1.  He requires people to partcipate in class for participation points.  Everyone is required to have 50 participation points.  That means, I'd have to raise my hand 50 times...Or, write a couple thesis papers between 1 and 1 1/2 pages long for 10 points each paper. I chose to write the papers.  2.  He got the class into a few political discussions.  If I wanted to get into political discussion, I take a political science class.  He also got the class into a religious discussion.  Irritating.  3.  He writes his notes on the chalk board, but jumps around too much to follow.  WTF?  I can't remember my 4th reason, but it'll come to me later...

      Well, I went to the neurologist yesterday to see if I have carpal tunnel.  So after sending electrical currents through my nerves, he said I don't have carpal tunnel, but the nerve response in both arms is slow.  I told him I dislocated my left shoulder about 5 years ago, so he starts checking out the nerves higher on the arm.  Then he pulls out this needle.  This needle hooks up to the machine.  He starts poking the needle into various muscles.  I wasn't too comfortable about it.  It hurt for the most part, especially when he started sticking the needle in the back of my neck.  That was the worst.  So, in the end, he found no evidence of pinched nerves, nor carpal tunnel.  The doctor did say that I have slight nerve damage in both arms, and that I should get tested for diabetes.  I don't want to get tested for diabetes.  If it comes back positive, I'd have to change my eating habits, and probably stop drinking Pepsi.  I guess I can change to caffeine free diet pepsi (tastes just like pepsi) cause diet pepsi tastes like crap.  Oh well.  I guess I'll get tested later...hehe

      So I spent most of last week (Thursday-Sunday) working on installing Gentoo Linux on the dual pIII sitting over there ------->  Lots of compiling! =)  Now that its installed, I've been emerging programs left and right, getting the computer just right.    I put Winblows XP Pro back onto the laptop, so now I can run eTools when I game (D&D).  HP does their pcmcia weird.  It wouldn't work correctly in gentoo.  So I've had no wireless until I put XP back on the laptop.  That's ok. I have the dual pIII with gentoo now.

      I've been following the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn.  It has taken some awsome pictures.  It started to map out Titan's surface.  If you like space and all that good stuff, check out the Cassini-Huygens web page out at  urlLink http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm .  After that, if you would like to discuss the mission, connect your IRC client to irc.freenode.net and join #cassini .  JPL staffers show up when they can to talk about the mission.    You can find up the up to date log of #cassini  urlLink here .

      Ok.  So my unemployment extension ran out, so I needed to pick up a job to take care of my car payment, insurance, cell phone, and tivo.  I've put hundreds of applications in, ranging from IT jobs to crap retail jobs.  I got hired at Starbucks.  It sucks but its enough for my bills while I'm going to school.  I've never worked retail before.  This will hopefully just be a temporary thing.  I've got another job I want to get, but am just waiting for it to open up.    I slipped and fell on my ass today at work.  Hurt my ego more than anything.  So now my back hurts (more than it did earlier today).  I've already got chronic back pain...and a bad knee...and nerve damage in both arms.  I'm falling apart.  Oh well...  I'll bitch about something else later...
