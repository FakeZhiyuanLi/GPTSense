      time: 2323   anyone read han4yu3pin1ying1? well, i went to the quan2 guo2 zhong1 xue2 hua2 wen2 dian4 zi3 zhuan1 ti2 zhuo4 ye4 bi3 sai4. that is the national secondary schools computer presentation chinese project competetion. or something liddat. i dun translate well. sry ;P it was boringgggg. especially the judges. hopefully they dun see this. (there's a very small chance anyway. like 0.000000000000000001%?) hahaha. they kept the Q &amp; A session xtremely long. tats y. and as usual my sch (TCHS) would get the prizes >.  i got ep3 today, tat is actually the cca wif a very profound name. Enhanced Pupil Performance Programme. the 3 is actually a 'cube' for the 'p', get it? im in the chinese orchestra. and i 'pon' 2 or 3 weeks the last month or so and the seniors r angry. but, no matter. im back. new and improved too.   i dun usually watch football unless sum kind of international thing. i dun watch s-league or wadeva there is out there. i wonder singapore dun wan go get the tiger cup or sumfin liddat. eeek its so late. i watching soccer now. france sure win. if not i can go chop head liao. so... b4 i go (and do sum stupid hmwk too) here's sum thing to think about: (hey dun take offence at these. these r to put u in sum pple's shoes onli. dun get mad and bcum a cow. lolz)   if u feel damn pissed of wif ur parents after a quarrel, think, there are a lot of kids who are orphans and dun even have the opportunity to have parents or their love in their lives. not all are adopted u noe. u tink wad? happily ever after? nah... this world we live in is such a dark and cruel place... so lets juz thank god for parents instead of going: "*$%^#$%^!!!" and saying hurtful thing lyk i hurt u. and those dumb vulgarities.   u feel so depressed. such that u wanna commit suicide. think. so many pple die everyday, NOT OF THEIR DECISION. for example, lyk accidents or sum idiotic criminal... so, be happy that God gave u a life and treasure it, dude. for life is a blessing, never a curse, its is u, who makes and mould that life, YOU. so make the rite decision.   well, i could go on for ages, for this is juz the tip of the iceburg... haha i also gtg bathe. slept immediately after ep3. which was frm 2 to 6 but i left 1/2(half) an hour earlier. yea! i got my instrument(suona) fixed! haha!  okay, see ya pple!!! ;)   time: 0145

      time: 1938  eeek. the sch term seems so much nearer. and i detest it... hai. wat 2 do bout it? nothing much... church has been much more realistic to me during the hols. thank god for that. i hve found many new frenz in church tat i had nver known. heh. and i used to think satying at home wif e comp was blissful. well my eyes r opened now... >.  today i went to the Singapore Association for the Physically Handicapped. SAVH for short. my teacher was the one who organised the activity called 'lunch in the dark' its basically eating while in an environment of pitch blackness. though it costs a hefty price. the xperience was worth it. and boy, was it filling, like i was eating a buffet. its so dark u cant see anything at all. even right in front of ur eyes. thats y its not at sum kind of other restaurant. oh yah, the money goes to help charity. about 20 or 25 bucks cant remember. there's a mushroom soup + bread... than xcellent fish and chips.the cooks were GOOD. and those waitress are specially trained to memorise the surroundings in the 'dark'. so they can navigate. those pple working there have vision problems. mainly being only able to see straight in front of them(no wide vision). and can see sideways without turing their heads. note: this idea was from a blind pastor. with the help of a swedish restaurant.  dessert was supposed to be chocolae cake but the teacher made the change for it to be fruits. so interesting. guessing wats gonna be in ur mouth next. dun worry, everything is edible ;) than there was ice cream + 2 hersheys kisses. dun ask me got what flavour. i cant see. its all mixed. thats y. we had to pour our own drinks ourselves. in the dark, and yes, there were numerous spills. they were sticky too. than they switched on the lights and we had coffee or tea. the room was in a total mess. that was expected. we had to spread butter on bread in the dark, use the cutlery, etc... in total darkness. most pple didnt bother but used their hands like ancient ways of (cave)men. so much food, that i needed to go to the loo after tat. lolz. only one thing to say about this. to gotta try it, to experience it. no words can describe it...cant miss sumfin liddat, man. its good, really. :-)  well, i'll love to tok more, but im damn tired. now i noe wat i've been missing lastime when did nothing but shake leg at home during the holidays. i shld have did sum useful stuff yea. well thx to the almighty GOD WHOOHOO!!! bbi frenz out there :)  okay i alreadi changed the settings but the time is still screwed and its making me mad... can u pple understand the time that i post? its in 24 hour time format. juz think about it, it is(and makes sense to)  p.s can any1 tell me wat is the meaning of ---> 'w00t'  time: 2204

      time: 2245  aaaaaaahh!! wad to do? i feel like pon(ing) mass jog tomorrow but got attendence and such reasons holding me back... i skipped cca too many times, and got dumb project to do, and another one more important too. haiz, so busy sia. but after tat can slack 1 dae than must study test and bia ACE points... NOOOOOO... so bad, like time management so easy. even the teachers take xtra long periods of time to mark sum lame wksht. and worst of all is that hve to file it...   man. no wonder, its term 3 and end-of-year exams coming soon!! i...cant...get...exempted for any... -_- where r the tears? at least got o humans paper tis year. now i am juz doing tis thing bcoz i dun feel lyk touching hmwk (hve a bit but same as none) or mrp. i hve no idea wat to do. its like piles of info, dunno wad 2 do wif it. well, at least i take time to de-stress myself, and laugh a ton at sch coz e pple there r insane and got all kind of farney jokes (literally ALL KINDS).   church is so fun. i used to think it kinda stinked. used to be a worldly christian (if u noe wat tat means). now i am born-again! thx God if not i'll still be pretty screwed and most propbably worse off. oh ya i gtg soon coz irritating sis wanna plae sum puzzle games... haiz, she addicted but i come home 1st ;P  here's something to think about: i am sure u hve heard of pple who, well, stopped being christian. their reason, coz they tot being one would be a breeze and u would lead the best life ever and it will be yi4 fan1 feng1 shun4. it turned out they led pretty hard lifes and thus eventually gave up. heres the punchline, if they lead harder lives with god around, than what would their lives be if they did not hve Him? well, actually i hve tons ore stuff to tok bout, but i feel so down in the dumps(stressed) actually i put them here so i wun 4get them :)  hope u pple out there will hve peace, coz its hard to find. but i noe how. find God! go 2 ur nearest church today for more information. (doesnt it sound lyk an advertisement? i would feel lyk puking if not the fact that i wrote it. lol)  God Bless! >_  time: 2306
