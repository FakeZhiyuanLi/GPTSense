       one last post to counter my recent commy post-  Sweatshops were probably the creators of the sneakers on your feet.  Some little kid probably spent 10 minutes stitching the sole of your shoe on in sweltering hot weather, and probably got paid about a half penny for it.  The T-shirt and sweatshirt you have on were probably made in some Asian country.  Your pants, probably some supposedly “third world” country in Africa.  All this happens in a sweatshop, where people of all ages are forced to do dangerous and menial tasks, and make as much money in a week as most employed adults in the U.S. make in a couple of hours.  The view taken by most Americans is that sweatshops are horrible and should be stopped immediately.  This seems to be the one time that we take interest in anything beside ourselves.  However, that may be just what world economy does not need.  These sweatshops are revitalizing the Asian economy, and the sweatshops are moving up.  The best way to help is to buy more from sweatshops, not less.  This is not praising sweatshops, or the horrible safety conditions.  Just the way that they treat children appalls me.  But for every bad one, there is also a good one that is somewhat safe, injuries are cared for, and the pay is middle of the line, not just very bottom.  Not all sides of the story are told, just the bad ones.  And, of course, the bad ones shouldn’t be allowed to exist.  But they could be fixed.  And measures could be implemented to make them safer.  They provide a stable basis on which poorer economies can build.  And the money is desperately needed.  TIME magazine interviewed a woman in Nigeria, who had six children.  There was a bad outbreak of malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes.  She had to decide which of her children slept inside of the mosquito net and which slept outside.  But if she had been employed, even just for a day, with her wages she could have probably bought another mosquito net.  Americans boycotting Nike or Adidas apparel to save sweatshops workers could actually kill them, because it would put the workers out of a job that they would desperately need.  These sweatshops are the reason that the slow economy in China has risen, and income has doubled.  In some parts of China, there are even middle classes.  From all the misery that they create, sweatshops can also start new lives for people, and make money for kids who would otherwise starve while attending schools.  Nothing is accomplished without work.  As a Chinese proverb states, "First comes the bitterness, then there is sweetness and wealth and honor for 10,000 years."  Maybe sweatshops really are a blessing in disguise.   i do not agree with sweatshops one bit and i am very pro union, but writing this really got my mind going

           It is only possible for communism to work in theory.  At the present state of our society there will not be a true, scientific and properly functioning form of communism that will be allowed to govern and prosper over a whole nation.      A commonly believed definition of communism is a society ruled by a single party with a monopoly on political power and free speech and suppresses all opposition, and it is an economy controlled by centralized bureaucratic planning.  However, by scientific definition communism is a classless society with no exploitation and no oppression from one from one section of the population to another, no armies or police and no production for profit or exchange.      There has never been a scientific form of communism in our world, and socialism has only existed in infantile form, such as the Paris Commune and Lenin’s Revolution. The ten basic and easy steps to communism are: abolition of property in land (all land is rented from the government) heavy income tax abolition of all rights of inheritance confiscation of all emigrant and rebel’s property centralizing credit to the state by means of a national bank centralizing communication and transportation to the state factories and productions owned by state equal liability of all labor combining agriculture and manufacturing and redistributing the population free public education and no child workhouses       Communism has at one time or another been a popular idea in the many countries where there have been Communist parties at one time or another, including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia.  Many countries have had a communist party or form of government at one time or another. According to Engels and Marx, “Communist theory can be summed up in a single phrase; abolition of private property.”  Communism can also be said to follow the principle of “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.”   One problem with reinstating communism into our world today after the collapse of the Russian and Chinese Communist Parties is called the Crisis of Theory.   The Crisis of Theory deals with the facts that our modern society is ruled by the bourgeoisie (the rich middle and upper classes), and the level to with which they perpetuate our culture.  The fact that they promote women’s bodies as commodities and belongings, that they are pushing at us insincerity and unquestioning belief from so called “authority figures”, and the spend, spend, spend, spend which is pushed at us through television, radio, magazines and other media outlets.   One question presented when dealing with communism is “Can the system function without capitalists?”  The answer is a resounding yes.  “To say that we could not work without capital is as true as to say that we could not mow without a scythe.  To say that we could not work without a capitalist is as false as to say that we could not mow a meadow unless all the scythes belonged to one man.  Nay it is as false as to say that we could not mow unless all the scythes belonged to one man and he took a third of the harvest as payment for the loan of them.”  This is a quote from Robert Blatchford’s book Merrie England. The question of whether we can function without capitalists has been asked in many different forms throughout our history.  Can we function without slave owners?  Yes!  Can we function without feudal lords?  Yes!  So can we function without capitalists?   However, without the capitalists you would be without the competition that is ingrained in their economical system.  Without this competition most communist nations falter or stay at a technological growth standstill, and fall farther and farther behind capitalist economies and nations.   The most obvious and inevitable problem that leads to the failure of communism is the corruption of leadership and power.  While the whole point of communism is to have working class rule without leaders, communism has created many leaders, and some leaders of communism are corrupted by the leadership and power they wield over the trusting middle class.  This sometimes leads to a conversion of the government from a communist government to a dictatorship. Some notable attempts at socialist and communist revolutions and governments are Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the Paris Commune of 1871.      The Paris Commune was an ill-fated attempt in the history of revolutionary coups attempting to change governments to communism.  When France went to war with Prussia in the early 1870s they lost, but this was something that the Parisians were not willing to accept.  The Parisians and the National Guard took cannons left over from the Siege of Paris and transferred them to working class areas.      When the government sent in troops to retrieve these cannons, they refused to fire on the crowd, and the crowd proceeded to force the national government to withdraw to Versailles.  The crowd continued to occupy and control the city, and many fled.      On March 26th a vote was cast and the Paris Commune was voted in.  The Commune then moved to decrease rents, allow up to a three-year delay on the payment of overdue bills, set up unemployment and allowed trade unions to take over the management of factories.  Much was done during these months to improve women’s working rights.      But on April 2 troops began to attack France, and on May 21 reached Paris.  10,000 to 30,000 Parisians were killed, and public executions were started.  One week later, May 28, the Commune had completely collapsed, and more than 5,000 Parisians were transferred to penal colonies.      One major problem with the Paris Commune was the revolutionary violence that was used to transfer the power of the government.  Revolutionary violence when used in revolutions usually leads to retaliation from the victims, and it did so in this case.  However the implements the new government installed in its brief three-month reign proved that Paris might have been on its way from converting from capitalist to socialist to communist forms on a government.       Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution led to the creation of the Soviet Union, which lasted until 1991.  One problem with this revolution was the fact that the leader, Lenin, may have been corrupted.      One statement from him to his Commissar of Justice, who had asked him, “What is the point of a People’s Commissar of Justice?...It would be more honest to have a People’s Commissar for the Social Extermination.”  To this he had replied, “Excellent idea!  That’s exactly how I see it.  Unfortunately, it wouldn’t do to call it that.”      This can be interpreted however one wants to it.  But it might not mean what it seems.  One definition of “social”, according to Webster’s New World Edition Third Edition, is “of or relating to upper classes”.  So this statement could be interpreted as meaning that Lenin wanted a Commissar whose only job was to try to exterminate the upper class.      Lenin also has said, in an order to member of the predecessor organization to the KGB, “You must make an example of these people.  Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people can see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards and known bloodsuckers.”  Again this statement may have been completely blown of proportion, although one can interpret in many ways.      Another problem with communism is the revolutionary violence used to usher in the new government, or the violence that the communist government enacts on its followers.  According to The Black Book of Communism, during the USSR’s regime, there were more than 20,000,000 deaths, and the People’s Republic of China has an astounding 65,000,000 deaths by communist and socialist regimes.  This book estimates that in the 20th century there were between 85 and 100 million deaths by these communist and socialist regimes. Two of America’s biggest enemies of communism were J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Were they wrong or right?  Is communism a totalitarian and oppressive form of slavery?  Or is communism the inevitable peaceful abundant and utopian future of mankind?  One thing to keep in mind when reading their statements and books is that the only forms of communism that they had ever seen were corrupted, as all communism is.  No communism has ever followed its scientific definition and been a completely classless society with one class, working, and no oppression. One rather ironic side effect of the 20th century communists is the leaders it has created.  While communism’s main purpose is to abolish leaders, it has influenced and created many, including Stalin, Lenin, Marx and Castro.      All that communism can do in its present state and in our present capitalist society is provide our society with a better alternative viewpoint and a possible alternative society.  It might be that in the future there may be scientifically correct functioning of communism without corrupt political rulers.  But there are the problems of revolutionary violence, power corruption, bloodshed and the Crisis of Theory .                           my props to anyone who made it this far ( i only proofread the whole thing through once, and that was skimming) and i am hoping the punk movement kicks in soon cause i'm getting really tired of the art rock (zeppelin) writing and the 2000 word blogs-anyone agree?

      FIRE  the fire contained in a metal ring inviting you to talk to the other people sitting around it discussing their day nature and all the other things that matter or happen to them both good and bad confiding in people friends family as they sit and watch the orange and red flames dance over the logs the conversation turning sometimes funny and humorous sometimes being still deathly still and very serious or just filled with silence both kinds comfortable and uncomfortable but still always a good time a time for reflecting and talking to people  THE SHINGLE FIRE  the shingle fire a high fire a roaring fire a bonfire a fire larger than all others one in which old roofing materials shingles that burn high nails that melt insulation that smells as they all burn one that leads to the clear-burning question if shingles burn so well why do I put them on my roof THE LIL’ PEOPLE FIRE  the lil’ people fire one at which everyone is amused by the little people the young the toddlers and babies the conversation of increasing simplicity as everyone tries to decipher the mumbled speak of the lil’ people inconvenienced by a lisp a short attention span and a stutter but still enjoying himself throwing things in the fire the “hot lava” with talk of a T-rex and some dinosaur bones and remarking of the view he had seen that day when he climbed or was helped to climb up the bluff almost a thousand feet looking down somewhat scared but enjoying himself all the more for the danger then being scared some more and refusing to come down without the help of his “Da-ee” and being so tired that he had to be carried home and then had to take a nap but was very energized very well a couple of hours later just in time for the fire playing with his dinosaur toys pretending to be Spiderman and shooting everyone with webs he reflected while playing around the fire dodging the smoke and flying embers and ashes on having the best day he had ever had in the company of everyone he knows and loves  THE SENIOR’S FIRE  the senior’s fire takes on a slightly more talkative tone with the sitters reminiscing and talking about their life to their kids and their grandkids and singing songs that they were taught by their parents who were taught by their parents and so on in turn reciting poetry that they know and love and remember from fires long past what the senior’s fire lacks in physical activity it makes up for it in spirit  THE COOKING FIRE  the cooking fire not much of a fire at which people talk but interspersed with cries of “hot stuff coming through” people at all different stages of the eating process some preparing a plastic plate filled with camping fare recently roasting over the fire some tending the food roasting over the fire some sitting watching over everything watchful of everyone making sure no one gets burned just in charge and knowing what’s going on with everyone nobody talking much until later while just sitting around the fire when everyone is done with the cooking and baking and roasting and burning and scorching of food then it is time to talk and to discuss the day the food and the fire  RAINY FIRE  the fire in the rain one of waiting and hoping and wanting for the rain to stop as you sit under a tarp and watch the rain fall down out of the sky watching the lightning strike and wondering if you shouldn’t be better protected contemplating thoughts of running to the car or to the tent but all of this overshadowed while you watch the fire hoping above all hope that it will not go out running to the fire between downpours of rain and throwing on more wood hoping that it will last to the next stoppage of rain  FIRE W/ FRIENDS  the fire that occurs with friends in tow originally against the whole concept of living outside of their sheltered home but you managed to convert them into the correct the right way of thinking with nature now they are in awe of you as you create the campsite and build a fire and teach them how to make s’mores and roast hotdogs you have successfully converted more to the ranks of the natural people you sit around the fire all night talking at first of stupid things like dating but moving on to the natural world and what you hear and what you see you spend the night around the fire with nature with friends  COUPLE’S FIRE  the fire at which sits the couple too busy in their complete and total infatuation of each other too notice the fire yet it plays a subtle note in the romantic scene of two lovers who like both each other and the outdoors the outdoors which drew them together and will keep them together the fire the focal point the maker of light the cooker of food the one provider all that it asks is some fuel and it provides the couple with their necessities the couple’s fire the provider  NO FIRE  the fire that isn’t a fire the fire that is non-existent the fire that has failed or been rained out or worse abandoned the fire that never happened the fire that is just a memory the fire that was deserted when the rain was too hard and everyone ran and hid or the fire that was forgotten as everyone moved on to their satellite plasma TV’s and their RV’s sleeping in a bed watching the football game in the middle of the woods or the fire that everyone forgets as they go to bed after a long day in nature the fire or the fire that is neglected and goes out because no one cares and they are all busy doing other more “important” things the fire that should not be neglected or forgotten and should always be created first thing the fire that symbolizes and embodies the whole concept of camping of caring and creating for yourself and relying on nature for everything that you could want or need

      he is sittin there right there on his own corner his own space in this bustling city with one of his few personal possessions a glimmerin shimmerin saxophone and he is entreatin and beseechin me for money but he’s not beggin he is a step above the men who step out of the same open doorways in which they slept flashin their discolored teeth “spare change?” “spare change?” and for that he earns my respect he may not be a white collar man or a factory man but this is a job this is his job and he is a great sultry and smooth jazz musician playin the blues one of the few men whose really got ‘em slidin up and down his scales screechin out the high notes with class and the deep reverberating low notes echoin off of the empty streets the facades of the buildings across the street where all the men who are supposedly “better” than him have “real” jobs but this man he’s different for he can evoke a deep and visceral response inside of me the street corner saxophonist is the man I can really respect
