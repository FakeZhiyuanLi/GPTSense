       The night darkens, It darkens the world... Like the poison in my very own, Soul... I'm all alone yet, There are so many people around me. I just can't stand this pain, Anymore I've got to get away...    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... And you.    Seated in silence, Staring at the knife... It's blade so silver and shiny It carves scars so deep in my flesh Releasing my deep crimson blood I let it drip... When will I awake from this nightmare? This nightmare they call my life...    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... And you.    You've treated me in such a way that, (You've lead me to my grave) You've haunted me, screamed at me (You've lead me to my grave) You've hurt me, you're killing me... (You've lead me to my grave)    Silent screams   Realistic dreams   Dry Tears   Forgetful fears... So many fears... And you.

       I knew you better, than anyone else, I’ve ever known... We were so close Shared all of our secrets and dreams, Trusted each other entirely, Our friendship just so strong     Now you’re gone but, the spirit of yourself, Still lingers here It’s stopping me from surviving though, The memory of you is still very much alive, Gloating me and haunting me Tugging at the essence of myself    Never have I felt, So much sorrowfulness and despair There are a million things, I should have said... We may never meet again So all of those words and there meanings, Are lost forever    You died and, I am still living but, Can I live on without you? Fill the empty whole in my heart or Am I lost forever in? Nothingness and loneliness Afraid to love again.

       So it came to be this isolation, I can only look to myself to find the way it, All began... The emptiness, The constant hunger for what I strive for, More than immortality, More than my own life... Answers My mind seems never-ending, I am trapped living in it, Deep down inside... Surviving in the painful silence, So icy cold and fearing being hurt again, I'm too scared to move Frozen thoughts Aching soul Suffocating dreams The sun used to shine on me, I knew and felt about, Something they call happy I always knew just where I wanted to be That sun is gone and, Replaced by night... I only know misery and greif, I don't even recognise myself Losing grip of reality, Slowly letting each drip of blood, Drop and take away... My sanity

       This is stupid. Sick of constantly staring at the computer... Or into space. Which i think is okay since you learn alot from space In science we were doing space, I did this big styrophome universe Whatever happened to that? La la... I am very bored. This is all very boring There are so many words that rhyme with boring snoring, pouring, louring.. Louring. Why isn't that a word? Who gets to make up the words anyway? Is there some over-weight guy sitting in a breaking wooden chair.. Just making up the words on his crinkled piece of paper? I want to. Do you think if the world got waterguns we could put out the sun? Then we would have a nice world of darkness. Cool. But then we're getting back to the whole science thing.. Darkness. Black. I like wearing black. I don't know why my parents are so against it. I mean if I wore white everyday they wouldn't care... Its as if they think black is evil Really black banishes negative evil things anyway So we're all safer wearing black. Like at night time we should all be in our satin black pj's yelling at the top of our lungs: "Stay away evil people I'm in my blackhouse!" That would be interesting. I think I am a very sad person. Deprived of sanity. Hmm.. I wish I had talent. Ja Rule is in alot of movies lately. Ahhmyspacebarwon't work.. its fixed now Cease the moment you only live once Why is that? Why is it that there is no exact answer to how it all began? Why do people waste so much time being racist when all the fighting really isn't going to do anything. Bombs won't do a thing. Pete. I hate that name. I suppose I could be called Peter but theres always that one bastard who'll call you Pete I love my friends. Seriously I couldn't live without them. I am so close with some of them. I wish I could talk to my mum.. The brady bunch is a hoax. What family is really happy? Plus they'd have the day to day stress of having to feed six kids.. Whatever happened to that Scott Cain popstar guy?

       This poem is written by myself (shadowlurk) and my ex boyfriend (lonewolf) we wrote it together to help express some of the emotions we were feeling.        ~Lonewolf~ When I think back. To all that we have I think of all the mistakes. All the mistakes that I could have stopped. And all the fights I could of stopped. Now things have gone too far, Too far, to change. Tears fill my eyes... Another night left to cry. My heart is filled with pain, `Cause I know nothing will ever be the same. Our lives are a mess, Now everything is lost Now your heart is breaking, because of me. Again because of me What is this thing we call, love is it meant to hurt? Is it meant to feel like this? Someone please tell me, is it?    ~Shadowlurk~ Cold tears Running down my blood covered face All I can do is run, run away from your, Living memory... Run away from life As far as I run, the problems, the pain, Follows me. A cold tear falls upon my stomach, awakening me to the reality of being, A victim of heartbreak Everyone knew how strongly I felt of you How you astounded me with your each word, Your soul, the most amazing soul that will ever, Roam this earth. You had the most incredible, wild, Imagination. One of the most precious people in my life, The sweetest flower, In the garden of life.     ~Lonewolf~ Destitute No more words. Emotions too strong for words to encompass, are draining my soul tonight. Loss undermines me Pain overtakes me. I fear to love - and love again. I'm scared to want - and yet I want her. No more, I beg. Please let it end. For fear of losing, I cannot win! Shall my heart be as granite? The hope of love be banished? I cannot resign myself to loneliness The fairy-tale awaits So I choose to believe. Yet a doubt lingers... Once love is lost too many times It's relegated to verse and rhymes, Existing for some, But not all For some appears a bridge, For me a wall No more words. Emotions too strong for words to encompass Drain my soul Leaving me destitute.    ~Shadowlurk~ I feel just so cimmerian, Forever trapped in this unenlightening world I collapse down onto the icy path, Watching other couples pass Being so far away from you is like god damn enslavement People stare at me, as though I am insane Lost inside my state of confusion, They cannot feel this suppressing sting... The happy times we had together, feels like an fantasy Why is it that, I cannot stop thinking of you? Why do your words and thoughts, effect me so? I hate it that our love feels illegal When it's the one thing that is real and pure Now suicidal thoughts are surrounding me, My misery is the result of you Each time I let it be known, that I love you I have to sacrifice my self-esteem I get trampled on and am left in a weeping pile.. . And now I really don't want to see, See another day. Because I’m feeling so alone Looking back, pains me but, I am afraid to look forward.. This is for you, from me These are my final words I love you. And that's why I can no longer be.
