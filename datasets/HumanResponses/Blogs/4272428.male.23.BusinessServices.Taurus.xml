						    I just wanted to take a moment to clarify something, based upon the feedback that I have thus far received.  I really hope that I am not expected to have all of my posts be as enjoyable as the first.  My mind is generally following about ten random and unrelated tangents at any given time.  Sitting down and writing is my atempt to bring at least a few of them together for myself.  So don't be alarmed if some of my posts seem to have no relation at all. . .If I don't know where I'm coming from, how can I expect anyone else to?  :P

						    I just found out the other day that one of the guys that I ride with from the   urlLink  yamahafz1oa.com    message board has his 14 year old daughter hit on her way to school on wednesday. Part of the mail he sent to one of the members:  I just have an hour or so at home before returning to the hospital. Yesterday morning, my 14 yr. old daughter was stuck by a car while walking to school. She is in the ICU of Riley Childrens Hospital - here in Indianapolis. Although her 'signs' for eventual complete recovery are encouraging, she has multiple fractures of the skull at the base of her brain, and her recovery will be slow. Add on the plastic surgeries that will be needed, and I'm afraid that I won't be able to make this trip. This is truly a parents worst nightmare. Please keep my family in your thoughts. I don't have the time to post anything 'public' in the forum, but feel free to do so, if you wish. Mike (hammer)  If you wouldn't mind taking a moment, you can send her an e-card at   urlLink  www.rileyhospital.org/cards/cards.jsp    . Her name is Michelle John. Just let her know that you are keeping her in your prayers, and you hope that all goes well. I am sure that the notes will help her family as well as her. No family, let alone a kid, should really have to deal with this kind of stuff.  On another note, going with today's title is my trip to the Metallica concert last night. I have seen them in concert twice before, and I absolutely loved them in concert. I was expecting much of the same kind of thrill in seeing this show when I bought the ticket. My opinion of the show? About half a step shy of abysmal. I really can't put my finger on why, either. I still like Metallica on CD, and I always stop at the station if the are on the radio, but I just  could not enjoy the show . I don't know if it was the $65 ticket price, the fact that when I spend mondy it's not just mine anymore, the fact that I kind of wanted to study for a WAN final, the fact that they are millionairs and felt the need to complain about people who download music (an entirely different sore point, one that I may share later), or the crowd itself.       I think I spent just as much time watching the crowd as I did the show. For the most part, it was a stadium filled with 30ish year old guys in black jeans and faded Metallica tour shirts. Not to be condescending or to come off as I am "above" these people, but I really didn't want to be associated with them. Setting aside their black-clad, mulleted deameanors was how the reacted to the show itself. In a surreal way, it reminded me of seeing old video of Nazi Germany with Hitler giving a speech. There were more fists pumping in the air and yelling on command than I have ever seen. Strong and somewhat macrabe visual, but I can't come up with a better comparison. I admit, I was yelling along too at some points, but I just really couldn't enjoy this show.      When I really think about it, I don't think I have really thought any concert that I have seen since high school was really good, or even worth the money. I can't put a finger on what has changed in me and my entertainment expectations since then, but at this point, I think I am ready to pretty much swear off concerts.  What has changed in me?  I don't know. . .      Growing up?      Expecting too much?      Tired of hearing millionaire entertainers bitch about anything?      Again, I have no answers on this one.

						        Well, here we are. After much thought and little effort, I finally got around to creating my own blog site. My inspirations for this were my friends, Colin and Penelope Dullaghan. They both have their own sites, and both are a great read. Colin:  urlLink  http://onlikepopcorn.blogspot.com  and his lovely wife lope:   urlLink http://www.penelopeillustration.com   While I know I can match neither of them for their creativity, I hope that some people may come to find the same enjoyment that I get from them. Anyway, about the name of the site. Pretty simple really. The bike I ride is a Yamaha fz6. Come spring, my wife will be getting either a Honda 599 or a Ducati monster. I think all of the "naked" class bikes are some of the most well balanced and beautiful pieces of machinery out there.  Putting this together has been a simple process, one that managed to let me pull up some great memories. In looking through my pictures for one to post here, I got to run through all of the folders on my PC. Finding nothing to worth posting, I started flipping though the books of my wedding day. I think it was one of the most fun and beautiful days of my life. The picture I chose is one that was taken of Val and I leaving the church. Thinking of that day, and the past two and a half years brought one verse to the top of my mind.                       "We never get to stop and open our eyes, One minute you're waiting for the sky to fall, and next your dazzled by the beauty of it all."     Lovers in a Dangerous Time-BNL                   Val and I have both been busy doing our own things, and it's been a little rough lately. I miss her more and more the less I get to see of her, and that verse sums up all my feelings. We both have been busy to the point that it doesn't seem like there is time to open our eyes and look at the world, let alone each other. Top it off with the fact that I've been kinda pissy lately about things ( waiting for the sky to fall ) . . .   Looking at the pictures of her brought it home for me.   Dazzled by the beauty of it all . I have never seen her more stunning than that day, and it made me remember how glad I am that I get to share every day with her. She is the most stunning and fun person I have ever met. I can't imagine a day in my life without her. I needed this. I needed to be reminded of what was important to me. Her. I guess the thing I learned today wasn't so much as something new, but something I needed to be reminded of. The day to day gets to us all. Just take a moment to remember what really makes you happy in life.  I love you, hon.
