      Some people leave a mark in your life.  On my part, these people left me my GREATEST LESSONS. Here goes…the “MORRIEs” of my life and my “quotables”  from them, with a little note on the side from yours truly, since this is anyway, a LETTER album.  My MOM: “Whatever you don’t have now, you don’t need.” ME: Mom, you have given me even those which I never thought I needed. “Thank you” is an understatement. So I don’t have a boyfriend yet because…? Hehe.  TRISHA de OCAMPO: “it's funny how when we were all little, we could not wait for the day that we finally grow up and fall in love, only to realize that it was so much easier to deal with scarred knees than broken hearts.”   ME: Trish, I am no longer little. I’ve scarred my knees more than once and had my heart broken TWICE…but still looking forward to the falling, rising, and everything in between.  – (excerpt from my article “Girl on a Pedestal” published in YOUNG BLOOD of the PDI, April 2003.) My wounds have healed sister. Now look. I only have the scars. Thanks for giving me the push when I once (twice, thrice!) got stuck.   urlLink    With Trisha and Daphne during office blessing (RCBC)&nbsp; urlLink     NANA NADAL: "I hate those moments... when you watch your "life" slipping away right in front of your very eyes ... you can toss and turn all night and come up with all sorts of rationalizations...explanations... justifications ... but you know what will make you feel best? ACCEPTING & LETTING GO." Ang sugat, talagang dumudugo.  Ang sugat, talagang masakit.  Pero, ang sugat, gagaling at gagaling din.  You just have to take comfort in that.  Whether it takes one day, one month, or nine years ... basta gagaling din 'yan.  PROMISE." -October 26, 2002. email. ME: (Yes, these lines really came from her.) You kept that promise well banans. If it's worth any consolation, you helped me nurse those wounds. TANGGAP LANG NANG TANGGAP we said. We didnt need to know or figure out WHY. I miss our friendship. SO much. You've made so much difference in my life and God knows you were part of who i have become. BIG PART in fact. I am sorry for those times i wasnt there; for the many other life-altering moments of yours that i missed; for the different path i have chosen. In time, i know i'll see you again. Do me a favor? Don't wear pink when i see you. winks!  WHO SAID I CAN'T BE A MORRIE? here's the BEST things i've learned from the BEST teacher of all--- EXPERIENCE.  "BIG Faith makes everything LITTLE, literally!" - when my right cystic ovary went back to normal size after 2 months since discovery. NO MEDICATION was taken.  "People change. People change their minds. their hearts. In the end, only one things remains sacred, friendship. They can hurt you, or HEAL you. Pretty much everything rolled into one. No matter where life takes us all, there comes a point when we still find ourselves back at the moment it all started. Back to being FRIENDS. - inspired by relationships between THEA PANES and AIDS DIGMAN, JASON MANLUNAS, AIMEE BARONA, YVETTE dela TRINIDAD and TING MALIKSI.  "Whatever he can't give, GOD will provide." - Hmmmm. I'd rather not say. there's only one in my list anyway.  "What i don't know won't kill me... but i still would rather know." - being a proponent of TRUTH, no matter how painful the truth is, LET ME DEAL with it. And i mean NOW, not tomorrow or after 5 years. - triggered by people who weren't truthful at one point or another. it's ok. it HAPPENS.  "No matter how grave the offense, FORGIVE just the same." It's what sets you free from whatever and whoever's hurting you. BELIEVE ME! it works. REALLY WELL.   (To be continued...)

      My 50 or 15? "FIRST" dates. (because i didnt have reason to go for SECONDS???) well sorta. (with the exception of some who i would gladly go out with, AGAIN! soon.)  Here's a few lines for the dates that 'were....' just FIRST.  SOME ENTRIES with pun intended... on one hand, meant to teach my lil sistahs what kind of species are out there lurking. on the other hand, some others are meant to be appreciative of the so-called "few good men."  (names need not be real. winks!)  GARY - The date that never happened 'AGAIN.' (HEy! taking me to the internet shop to browse your fave porn sites isn't exactly my idea of a date). Thanks for the insights though. You did resemble barry manilow as you said. I seriously hope we don't get to bump into each other again, "somewhere down the road." PUHLEAAAAAASE! it's never complimenting to think what a woman wears under tight pants and actually verbalize your imagination. I'd really rather... hmmm... sit that one out. Standing up again gets ur imagination rolling, anyway. Chai and Ian were nice enough to even just think of punching ur face after this experience. You, however gave me an option on dates. the option of walking out if and when. Hope you have a great life dude..despite all and in spite of.  MARK - chili's. How can i forget? I had nothing less than a FAB lunch. I will forever be grateful for the 'treat.'  I was so bent on goin dutch (as normally practiced in almost all my dates) but you were just persistent, insistent and... generous! It was a nice casual experience. thank you.  F.E.- YOU CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME. yes, as bloated as my ego was over the mere fact of being texted and remembered by a PBL player, i would like to rather think that you served ur purpose well at that time. 5 months. i cannot and WILL NOT forget because there was not a single day during that period that you missed on texting. I was rather on the verge of getting over someone and yes, and you were my diversion. a pleasant one indeed. i hope i did entertain you just the same. really! I was supposed to feel jittery the day you dropped by my office but no... it was like seeing someone i already knew well. I promise to try to see one of your games on tv next time. haha! so... yoga soon? harhar!! hey! was with charry last friday. we really should all gather for coffee or something... in the meantime, hoooy! be good. haha.  KIM - someone finally has the same food preference! ITALIAN! hmm.hmm.hmm. AMOROMA. over prosciutto ham pizza and pasta alfredo, kim and i managed to hit it off, effortlessly. Overwhelming as your friendster invite was, it was nothing compared to the mixed emotions that crawled through my spine (yes, my emotions are part of my 'neurotic' nervous system now!) when you picked me up from rcbc that day. My boss was actually frantic that you were picking me up with your eye-candy GOLD Expedition. She said she wouldnt know where to get ransom if i get kidnapped. A small boy with a BIG toy. (i'd say man, but it doesnt rhyme!) I wonder if you've migrated back to hong kong. I do appreciate you texting me once in a while... at 1am, 2am and sometimes 3am... hahaha. How's business goin kim? I have high regards for your accomplishments... hey! dont underestimate this dude.. franchise of jollibee, greenwich, grocery shops... should i go on and on? the fact that you had to work as "crew" was humbling on your part and remarkable to my eyes (and everyone else who knows that story im sure!) MY favorite memory of you? HAH! easy. when you asked me... "BABY ka pa ba?" suave kim... suave....and "cute" i must say. keep in touch kim. I would like to have you around.  MARCO - YOU were the nicest....and yes, youngest! (24!) the idea that you were into YFC (Youth for Christ) won you a date. hands down. Oh, seeing that OLD and AGED text message of yours saying that you hope to see a movie with me did some greasing as well. I miss YFC too. I actually can't think of a specific reason, well aside from age, why i can't bring myself to responding to your text msgs in as sweet a manner as you use yourself. Hmmm... there is something getting in the way. I'm not sure. That phonecall before you got out of my car was weird. Yeah, gave me cold chills actually. 'Kinda speculated it was a girlfriend (ex or otherwise). My thoughts? eeeghad... i hope i didnt just go out with someone "attached." I wouldn't want to violate my own dating rules. that's a no-no. NO-brainer to be precise. I was kind of worried though how you would be going home. It may sound selfish yes but... in this dating process that's taking eternity for me, i am hopeful that i find my-man-to-be, neither someone i'd be taking a caregiver's course nor be up against a pedophile case for.  Oh!...and someone with an ex-gf tailing is definitely not in my list of pleasantries. (believe me, my list is short!) i wont forget, as i said...you were really, really, ooober nice!  MYKEL - thank you for the enriching asian experience. As i told you before you make up for almost ALL asian identities, having been born in taiwan, raised in malaysia and singapore, and based here in manila. ooops! did i miss a detail? Among all my dates, i would say you were the most profound. The conversations were loved for the mere fact that they can be as intellectual as they can get. I never had a substantial amount of reverence for Buddhism and those other religions until you spoke about them with so much passion. Hey! have you been to davao or boracay again lately? if i get crazy enough to do something spur-of-the-moment and hmm... a lil expensive than usual, i might take you up on that boracay offer.... with the other B's... hahaha. You've met them right? I'll see you when your resto opens okay? Or even before that... must recharge my rusty good ol' brain.   DON - You were actually my first brave attempt to go out with someone OLDER... (hey! i didnt say old!) half-BRITISH, half-FILIPINO. Made me imagine you coming down from a good-looking, well "breed," for lack of a better term. LIBIS. SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE. 7pm. You said you have work at 8pm. That at least gives me an hour to endure whatever was about to transpire. For some weird reason, friends were texting me to call them in case i find myself in ANY trouble. KEY's in. ignition starts. I was actually looking out for more space to maneouver my way out of the space where i parked til my focus was disrupted by a text message. It read... "WANNA GO TO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE LATER?" I was holding my breath while adrenalin rushed up to my brain, almost out through the car roof. Instead of killing you (thank GOD you weren't anywhere near), i killed the engine. oHAHAHAHAo! Now i can laugh about it. We did go to somewhere private. HIS house. My house. SEPARATELY. I thought he needed as much privacy as he can get anyway. In fairness, dude apologized for being "offensive." Hmmmm... smell my feet you BRIT. ;)    MR. ENGINEER - Okay, so i decided to go out with someone older again. No foreign blood this time. You have proven to be the MOST gentleman and couth among all my dates. I mean what is it about older men anyway? well a lot. Professional, sensible and daym! They just know how to take care of their dates. HANDS DOWN. Hey! you even inspired me to write a separate entry for the experience. I hope God makes more of your kind... seriously!  GERMAN - no he isnt of any german origin. It's just the first word that comes to mind when i remember this dude since well, associations! There goes my next leap to going out with someone younger. 2 years aint that too big a deal anyway!? I was only apprehensive about the fact that it had to be another set-up. I mean what are the chances that this date spoils my momentum again? Hmmm... HIGH. Fortunately for me, you didnt give me any reason to regret it. It was apparent that despite the age difference, you were able to level with me. Your principles, those definitely got you the title, "interesting."   more soon...

      13/07/04 DEAR GOD,  This may be the hardest letter to write.  What do i tell Someone who already knows EVERYTHING? How do i play oblivious to the thought that YOUR PLAN precedes even MY EXISTENCE? or this letter?  THANK YOU. That's a good way of starting this letter.... For making me think. For allowing me to feel. To hurt. Then heal. For giving me options. For the freedom to make even bad choices. For making me learn. For giving me courage. To write. To speak. To stand up to my beliefs. And for MORE courage... to admit i'm wrong. To admit i'm hurt. To embrace my weaknesses. To share my imperfection. The courage to be MYSELF, around anyone...around everyone.   I AM SORRY. for being stubborn. for the flamboyant display of arrogance when i thought i knew better. or felt better. i wanted this, YOU gave me that. Sometimes at some point, i was not able to reconcile the difference. Then there were questions. I am sorry, for having raised the untrusty WHYs. In my mind, out my mouth or worse, both at the same time. I always know what i want. YOU always know what I deserve. I am sorry for creating this tug-of-war in between. It takes a while, a longer while than i thought. Until i realized, it was easier to LET GO.    When i said I wanted rich parents, you gave me the most selfless pair. The very little they had, they gave away. ALL OF IT. When i said i wanted to be first in class, YOU gave me honor and dignity in running second. When i was finally humbled by experience, you made me first.  You gave me someone who loved me best and i learned to love back.  You gave me someone who hurt me worst and i learned i can recover. I took health in a stride. Another nerve bloated in my ego, another inch added to the size of my right ovary's cyst. It was a "benign reminder." Everytime i didn't get what i wanted, I know YOU didnt love me less. YOU only missed me more.  What took you 7 days to create, I will have a LIFETIME to appreciate. The plan that you have written in the palm of Your Hands, i may never understand. Nevertheless, I have learned to take comfort in the fact that whatever I receive comes from the BEST HANDS.   When i woke up this morning, it was apparent. Everything i wanted to be, I already am. Eveything i wanted to have, YOU already have given.   So what do i tell SOMEONE who knows everything already? NOTHING. I just thought i should let THEM know.

      1135pm my room  SOMEONE.  I don't actually know who you are, where you live, or what you're doing. All i know is, right this very moment i wish you were here to read this letter. Not having you around this long is starting to take its toll on me. I wonder sometimes if you feel the same way. Writing to you, (to someone i havent met, recognized or remembered), seems a lil worse than preposterous, but as of now, i have no other means. This letter somehow keeps the thought of us together. in tact. Here rests the hopes of finding each other sooner. I'm not even sure if you like letters. I perpetually do, especially now that this is the CLOSEST that i can get to you.  What is it like being longed for? I ask because i am not quite sure if the same questions are running through your mind. Are you still in a relationship or are you just as i am, single by choice? Believe me, more questions will continue to surface as days go by. I am curious. anxious. both at the same time.    I haven't been into any relationship. SINGLE since birth. I've had very few attempts but to no avail. No need to justify why or how things happened. LOVE and LIVE, i continue to say to myself. I do believe that whatever pain they caused me, you will eventually benefit from as well. There were lessons to be learned. How many relationships have you had? Did you get hurt in the process too? I hope that when our time comes, i wouldn't be the one to hurt you but if i do, please do not think that i love you less.   I was driving by myself earlier tonight. Friends were texting me about their plans. it's a Friday. Everyone is supposed to have at least a 'plan.' It made me sad for a moment wondering how long i will have to endure being invited as third wheel (not that my true friends mind); how long i should outline my weekly schedule just so i don't mess up my girl best friends' plans with their significant others. It started to drizzle early. Then i started to miss you even more. There were no stars tonight. It seemed like the sky suffers the same ordeal as i do for the absence of something, of someone in my case. Hmmm.. how comforting. I wasnt alone in that sense.  They say that those things that never YET happened to us, will never fade away. So i always remember you the same way. FONDLY. I dont know when or how we will finally see each other and realize that we're supposed to be together. Did it ever happen that i was too preoccupied to notice you crossing down the street? or that you were enjoying every sip from your coffee mug with your officemates when i was just standing behind you, paying for my order? Hmmm... then again, if and when it happened, i take comfort in believing that it wasnt "according to schedule yet." ;)  Have you eaten dinner? I skipped my meal tonight. I am in fact about to sleep. I decided to write to you today hoping that this gives my day a sweet conclusion. Tomorrow is just 12 minutes away. Without notice, as i continue to type the words, those 12 minutes are diminishing... closing upon dawn. How i wish the days and months and years would unfold without the torturing thought of your prolonged absence.  Patience is never my virtue... but i believe there's a reason why you're not here. Just so you know, i remain positively anticipating of your arrival, or your return if we have met before, whichever applies. If only i could downward spiral my way to you. Then again, i wouldn't want to mess up the moment. OUR RIGHT TIME.  In the meantime, goodnight and sleep well.  WE WILL FIND EACH OTHER SOON.  late cargo: Can i write you another letter next week? ;)  THEA 1202am

      16june04 1621H my desk. (hey! no queues yet...)  Ting, Aimee, Yvette.  It seemed like ages.  I cant actually recall when the exact turning point was. It felt like a dream, and when i woke up, there we were - walking different paths.  Ting. I am so happy to see you happy. There may be too many questions in my mind, but to question your happiness would be far even from the outskirts of my imagination. I wish you more, in fact.  Somehow, i just lost track and i am sorry. It was quite a swell for me when we went out again last saturday. another time of my life. Imagine? we were just out the whole day...watched harry potter at eastwood cinemas, crashed into RCBC for my urgent after-office calls (thanks for the patience dear!), dessert at max brenner (remember who we saw?!my ex-crush WITH girlfriend. whew! tough challenge! glad u were there.) and lastly a tour of the fort to 'go nuts' over our donuts. You prove that despite our long silence, nothing has changed.  Aims. Among all girls, i find you most accessible. all the time. I do appreciate your being there for me as well. all the time. (did i say that already? winks!) I dunno if i am to be cursed because as we usually tell each other, since we got together as friends, you lost (or got rid of?) a bf and somehow never got one again. DAMN. if only for that, i'd rather that we be estranged again. (giggles) from the timid and shy girl i once knew...look at what you've become! hey! thanks for footing the dinner bill tonight. I feel so bloated.   Yvette. Who would have thought...who would have imagined... that you would finally change friendster status to 'in a relationship.' What have i done to you for you to leave me and my status unchanged? hahahah! I so remember the times when we were banging each other thru email. "So what do you do when you find that the pair of shoes you’re absolutely sure is for you has already been bought by somebody else?" - 05 MARCH 03.  Remember this excerpt from ur old email to me? 6 words for you my dear: IM GLAD YOU FOUND 'YOUR FIT.' hello russ! You both take care of each other.  HEY girlfriends! 5 more words for you 3--- BECAUSE SOME FRIENDSHIPS... DO LAST.     urlLink    MY HOMETOWN BEST Friends&nbsp; urlLink

      Delivered last March 2004 High School Graduation Our Lady of Peace School As GUEST SPEAKER. ---------------------------  I never thought I’d be back here for THIS reason.  Nonetheless it is my honor to speak before you Msgr. Rig de Guzman, Sr. Felicitas Bernardo, SPC, teachers/admin, parents and graduates.  11 years ago, I walked in the same aisle, wore the same uniform and waited with so much excitement in anticipation for college. I am aware of the similarities we share.  Back then, I was marinated in the same mixed emotions.  Today I share with you something personal before your minds go on vacation mode.  I was not born with a silver spoon.  Every little thing I dreamed to be, I had to work hard for.  OLPS holds a population of those memories, my values being well rooted in this institution.  Prior to schooling, my home embedded these values, thanks to my mom and dad, then OLPS became an investment.    Things took a 360-degree turn in my Junior year.  I was not, and I repeat, WAS NOT thrown into the pilot section, the cream of the crop as they say, icing on the cake for some. While I consoled myself saying, icing is fattening, it was hard enough to be categorized in such a way.  A very inspiring letter from Mr. Jun Lorenzo my sophomore year adviser, a smile and a hug at the HS library from Mrs. Cruz, my 1st year adviser, comforting chats with Mrs. Myrna Fulgencio, Mrs. Gemma Palumpa and Mr. Francisco most of all, welcoming arms of parents when we got home… those got me, hands down.  Winning isn’t always about who bags the biggest trophy or who wears the heaviest medal.  Victory came on to me in a whole new light. Running 2nd in the race, I was humbled by experience.   My senior year was the most challenging though.  Ms. Lorna de Guzman knew every tear that rolled down my cheeks when I was practically put through the hardest times as SCT coordinator.  There were maybe 7-8 other clubs to supervise, a student body to organize and extra curricular activities like JUNIOR A-FACe, local church choir, catechism in public schools, jazz dancing, DUGSo under my favorite Tita Lolit Garcia, and a lot more to joggle with my 2 hands.  Mrs. Barretto was forever supportive.  She fueled my determination to pursue what I aspired to be.  God works in mysterious ways.  He kept me totally preoccupied until there was no room left for worrying.   At the end of the year, I got the honors I wanted to bring home for my parents, and 13 other souvenirs.  I refuse to call them my medals, only souvenirs.  I went to UP Diliman for college.  Some expected that I will take up medicine.  Others thought I would make a very good lawyer.  Little did everyone else knew, I had a very strong passion for food.  With my parents’ feet up, head rested, and full consent, I pursued a course in HRA.  First day in the university and I had this instructor telling us “getting into UP is difficult. Staying in UP is even more difficult.”  She was not joking.  I crawled my way out of my math 17 and math 100.  I failed and took my chemistry 16 twice.  No joke.  Nevertheless, I chose to enjoy what I was doing.  I was even challenged to fill up the UP theater for a 3-day-GARY V concert, organize a movie premiere to refill the finances of my orgs. then in drought and hoped to do well in class.  You see, it is not so much on where life takes you, but rather what YOU DO when life gets you there.  So did I end up working in a hotel? Am I now the next BIG thing in selling the city’s most expensive dining place? NO. My knowledge on food preparation is rusty in fact.  The closest thing to practicing my course is perhaps eating and that concludes my career in the food industry.  Family and friends consult me for anything food-related but I have another passion, traveling.  I now work for IASA, a regional subsidiary of KLM ROYAL DUTCH AIRLINES, the flag carrier of the Netherlands.  We handle the marine market for KLM in Asia and the Pacific.   Colleagues sometimes ask if I’m contented calling myself “travel specialist.”  “WHY NOT?” is a favorite reply.  I was sent away once to man our office in the UK to cover the whole European market for a weekend.  I was sent to train with colleagues in our HOU office only find out that we have more to share with respect to the system KLM has been using worldwide.  The rest of the time I spend here or in other ASIAN countries which we cover.  So you see, it will never be just about your job title but the responsibilities entrusted to you.  Sept. 2003, after my 26th bday, just when everything seemed to be roses and blooms, I was diagnosed with a cystic right ovary. It was different feeling bordering on the thought of losing one of my organs.  Once again, I had to battle this condition with faith.  The same faith nurtured and developed in this school.  My dad was my pillar of strength, my mom, the epitome of undying faith. I gave God an ultimatum.  TWO MONTHS.  Why leave my condition to chance I said, when there is certainty that God makes anything possible?  1st week of December and I went to St. Luke’s on my own, and without even having to take a single pill or medication, the cyst was gone.  So here’s my two cents worth… Know what you want, and get it.  At the end of the day, make sure you find time to take a short trip --- the distance between your knees and the floor.  I LEARNED THAT HERE.  Whatever God doesn’t give you right now, HE will replace with something MUCH BETTER.  What other people cannot give you, He will provide.  My mom and dad may not be the richest couple now in this city, let alone in our village, but didn’t I tell you they made a very good investment when I was 6 years old?  The person standing in front of you is the product of that investment.  This speech isn’t about me, but about those people in this institution who made me… ME.   Cherish those times when your school is little, you didn’t have to get lost; times when you had to sit through grueling hours of home economics, that you didn’t have to beg  for the food that you put in your mouth; those times when your subjects were paid for by your parents and you didn’t have to line up at 5am just to lose a slot in a subject that’s mandatory to your course; those times when teachers are caring enough to tell you how to pass your subject than chase a professor who tosses class cards in the air to determine your grade.  This is the world out there, a little scary perhaps.  LAHAT NG BAGO NAKAKATAKOT SA UMPISA, pero HINDI LAHAT MAHIRAP HANGGANG SA HULI.  Your faith will define who you will become.  11 years from now, one of you will take this stand and speak before another batch of OLPS’ finest.  Make sure you take them to a refreshing trip down memory lane. It’s always good to be back HOME. Heads up graduates but keep feet flat on the ground and wherever they lead you, be sure to take OLPS with you.  From someone who’s been there, done that and back again, CONGRATULATIONS!

      "BUILD IT and they will come.  When JAM 88.3 pioneered an interactive radio program by opening its doors to an official chatroom (msn messenger: jam88p3@hotmail.com) it was like opening a well-aged bottle of wine - a much too tempting invite to forego. Thus, they now have a special breed of ladies and gents forming a steady niche for that…. chatting. There's actually no word to perfectly envelope what they do. Chatting does sound too lame. It would not be fair to cut their credits short, for they actually are willing to do more, all For the LOve Of Jam.  Hence the birth of the "FLOOJees." These people come from all walks of life and when you get to know them, it's quite amazing how they get along - individually, as the persons that they are, or as a clique, differences bridged and all. These are the no-holds-barred voices behind the chatroom with so much gusto to chat about any topic as soon as the the first "sunny-side up" is flipped, the "rick express" is rolled, the afternoon is refreshed and relaxed in "the lounge" under nice and easy "chill-sessions", road trips turned to "joy rides" even before dawn breaks as "the flight" takes off. Just a bit of warning though:   These people party just as hard as they chat.  NON-STOP.  They provide good company after a long hard day's work; make you laugh with the crazy pranks they pull on each other; crash the station at their own will (with the best intentions, mind you!) like bring food, some grabs… and even just to hang out and keep their fave djs company during boardwork.  As seemingly surprising as it may sound, they do look after each other too.  Needless to say, there is more to them than what you actually see.   Even if there would be a thousand and one ways to describe how wine is aged, there seems to be endless of reasons to hobnob with these people.  When you find just one good bottle that has a distinguishing taste of genuinely harvested grapes, laboured with love and all emotions possible --  you enjoy and savor it to the last drop.  Likewise for this group.  Only in this case, you always get a bottle FULL." --- (composed for the website JOICE initially developed for the group.)   15jun04  0945pm my room  8 months. I never thought i would have to give up my title that soon. SHOP-aFLOOJic. However, I have my reasons which most of you are aware of and i appreciate you for respecting those reasons. Brief but well-spent. You know our friendship goes far and beyond JAM's events, let alone the title. You guys have been my touchstone for quite some time. My break from it all.

      "SORRY." 5 letters. 2 syllables. Sometimes it's the ONE WORD people often find difficult to say. to verbalize. to express.  MY BLOG, so MY FEELINGS on the subject...  WHY DO WE SAY "SORRY"?  Take this scenario. You are walking. You are about to take a turn to get into the nearest bakeshop. Someone whistled and you take a glance back to see who it was. When you looked back straight ahead it was too late to notice this old lady carrying a huge brown bag practically covering her face. You hit her. Without any question, it was an accident. Unintentional. Your buzzer is pressed. Automatically...you utter... "Oooops! Sorry." or "Sorry po."   Most of the time we do things we do without the slightest intention of hurting someone. (You see, i believe that people are eternally good deep down, unless proven otherwise.) We say things we believe others will either laugh about or think about, nonetheless. Unfortunately, different people have varying standards. What's good and within the norm of social conduct of one is not necessarily the same for another. Hence, it is inevitable, even with the most careful efforts that we say or do something that pricks on the nerves of a brother, a cousin, a friend or a stranger. INEVITABLE i said.  So if you hit someone, you don't go jolting her back to reality by saying, your mind was running a 1000 miles per minute; you're out of load; you forgot; you were watching a movie; you were busy.  The last thing that will fill up the shortcoming is REASONING. That comes "secondary" only to saying SORRY.  There is ORDER in discipline. There is order in BREEDING. So dont make that mistake of raising your defenses up by giving a narrative of your "becauses." Whether it was intentional on your part or not, whether your means are not meant to be offensive in any way, if there is decency in your heart, you acknowledge the pain. Repair the damage and let the healing begin. Whether it involves a physical pain or an emotional injury, a co-human being deserves an apology. SIMPLY PUT.  If the person involves a friend or a loved one, most of all, and she seems to be acting out of reason or "OUT OF CHARACTER" perhaps, you don't just abandon them. Even if her reasons for blowing the whistle is BEYOND your comprehension, say sorry just the same that she feels that way but express your sincerity that you had no intention of causing her to feel that absurd certain way.  IS THAT VERY HARD TO DO? I wonder.   Saying SORRY doesn't make you GUILTY OF THE VERY CRIME. It can be taken from a multiple-level of interpretation, the base of which is being the simplest truth that you acknowledge the end result. Someone feels wronged. Saying sorry is dealing with the situation at hand. Someone is hurt so let's at least dust her off and help her recover balance. Saying sorry is an exhibition of remarkable HUMILITY, that you admit that you yourself are just as imperfect as the others are; capable of being offensive be it remotely impossible from the outerbanks of your civilized existence.  SORRY is meant to rebuild what was broken. Repair and reassure.  It doesn't make you less of a macho person if you apologize. IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE OF A PERFECT PERSON IF YOU DON'T FIND YOURSELF SAYING IT EITHER.  SILENCE isnt being apologetic about any situation. Silence only prolongs the torture, widens the gap. Silence never hushes the issues. SILENCE only covers up the issues. A wolf in sheep's clothing. The issues will resurface again in the next opportunity and that will take you back to square one. No amount of flowers or chocolates will equate to the power of this very word, "SORRY." No amount of sugar-coated-pink-cotton-candy talk will make you generally an "afternoon delight" to someone who's been hurt.  No other word or act will QUALIFY as an apology.  It's just one word but no matter how excessive the bleeding, how big the DEBT, how huge the gap caused, or how hard the blow was, SORRY does the seemingly impossible.    It corrects. It heals. It conquers.

       With my FAVE couple of the moment... Ula and Ron  urlLink     urlLink        17/july/04  an email from an old date. a text from an acquaintance at sidebar. marck must be wondering why he never saw me clubbing again. another text message from most recent date. hmmm... that one still proves interesting, only in a very good way. an invitation to go out from a 5'11 half-filipino, half-italian part-time model. i wonder if my gusto to meet him goes full-time. that half-brit, half-fil experience which ended before it began lurks its ugly tail in the picture.  i might as well get it over and done with huh? so what did i choose to do on a friday evening? beat the traffic and headed straight home. i was bummed out after and hour and a half of waiting for traffic to subside. no regrets because i knew if i went out, i would be half-hearted about enjoying it anyway.  besides, i don't think i will be spared enough time to put my feet up and relax next week so i'm sort of bracing myself for it.   angie will start training with amadeus so we'll be one staff short; 'superboy' lee is visiting from london, shower party for millet on friday, and what have i's for the rest of the weekdays.  i'm taking it slow this time. (did i just say THAT?!) so there.   16/july/04   The PRINCESSES AND ME.  I was bent on watching this almost saccharinely-sweet flick, "The Prince and Me" with two of my best friends, ting and aimee.  Little did i know that it would be preceded by hard-core action. hmpf! and i said yesterday i was bordering on being bored again.   Payroll day for most... tootsieroll for me as i curved and swerved going to intersection of pioneer and shaw.  clock read 729. i was running late for the 730 screening at megamall. whew! i hate making people wait...and this time, they even happen to be my best girlfriends. fingers tapping on the steering wheel waiting for the green light to flash before me. ALAS! there it was. so i stepped on the gas....going, going, counter-flowing (put down your eyebrows please?!) and boom. light turns orange, then red. dammit. that was quick! I was caught right at the very intersection with this van turning towards the direction i was coming from. hmmmm.... i swear i knew mat was in neutral then again the slightly uneven surface caused mat to move back a little. that short motion like that of your heel when you move from tip-toe to complete foot rest. unfortunately, dude driving his van halted. so the lil space between mat's bumper and van's side sort of "kissed." so now you can imagine the next picture. it was barely scratched-- his van i mean. however, i would rather "settle" at least for the inconvenience caused. so i did. okay, now off to megamall.  I was approaching richmonde hotel when i sort of felt that freon of mat seemed to have diminishing effect on air-conditioning. hmmmm... smarty pants. i rolled down the passenger's side's window.... okay so i had a fantastic view of the traffic, what now? okay... i said i will roll it back up. pushing... the window switch... hmmm... not moving... hmmm... YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME! what did i do to deserve all these??? eeeghad.. now my mind is running a 1000 miles/minute wondering how i can leave mat  at the parking lot with the window open. STUPID! i know i cant. it took me another gruelling knee-cramping 10 hours to wait to park at the 4th level just to find out there wasnt any space anymore. 5th level then. aims and ting now coming to the rescue, i told them of OUR predicament. Can my thursday night just bounce back to being BORING?!!! whew. I explained to aimee that "we" (mind the sudden change of pronouns from singular to plural HAH! ... thank GOD!) have to unscrew the door and force lift the window glass to come up, look for something to act as temporary support underneath so glass wont slide down and God forbid, do the belly dance and wait till at least 1 gentleman comes to the rescue.  well, we were rather left with 2 security guards, one screw driver and our 6 hands and 30 long nails to do the seemingly impossible. ting was holding the flashlight while aimee didnt waste a second. she just conveniently transformed to MS. AUTOMOTIVE i swear! (should you consider, short shorts and baby shirt as her tights-cape-and-boots-alternates!) one screw after the other until finally mat's right side front door was naked. alright, at least i took it from there. i've seen the men in the house do that before...so we managed to keep window closed using the wheel brush as support.  the rest we have to figure out after the movie that's what we said.  good thing mat didnt get stolen. i think i said the litany before we left the parking lot.  Come after the movie,  we had to  screw back the inside door cover, this time with 2 more men walking around the car religiously "STARING."  they could not believe 3 girls were doin the car fix. oh well, hmmm... what else is there to do. Then got a text. Jason was in makati. What impeccable timing! When he asked where we were and told him of our momentary and spur-of-the-moment portrayal of charlie's angels... he probably thought at first we were kidding. We got out of megamall safely, with mat and 2 best friends all in tact. When we were cruising along valle verde  highway, i frantically tought 1 tire was flat.   AREN'T WE HAVING FUN YET? Went straight to the nearest gas station and good thing, right rear tire just needed air. (maybe not as much as the 3 of us needed water for the experience). Jason, now assuming the role of CHARLIE, was constantly in touch. That was so nice of him. The last call he made gave us all a sigh of relief since we all realized we, girls, were finally home. almost home. If anything happens, at least the proximity of our homes will be comforting enough.  There were no princesses in the story, no damsels in distress.... just REALLY the best of friends sticking it out... no matter what. Hmmmm.... I think last full shows make the BEST screening time.     10/jul/04 Week of another batch of endings and beginnings, of extremes. Yvette left for bangkok. I was left dining in SUKHOTHAI for alex's bday last wednesday with mom. was a blast. Ate Vhie's ties loose at the seams with some people while our rope tightens as cousins. as FAMILY. Down to my last 20 bucks, then payroll comes. Bank account soars one minute and drains the next. Mat's oil needs changing! Slipped into my casual ruggedly looking white cargo capris and white tank top this morning but will need to parade around in a silver blue gown in ai and ryan's wedding later at 4pm. Brain dead from lack of sleep but head is banging to my fave tunes from ALTERNAthea playin on the background (courtesy of edwin leyva records. haha!) Salvation comes when you least expect it. I am back... and so is St. Therese. Tired and bordering on giving this dating thing a LONGER break, then i met a new friend last night. W H E W!  With Karen at Camp Aguinaldo for the reception of Ai and Ryan's wedding. 10/07/04  urlLink     urlLink     Nice to hook up with an ol friend... Karen. Best wishes to ai and ryan!  urlLink     urlLink      02/july/04 My week started on a WEEKEND. FRIDAY. Being swamped with so many things to do, i almost couldn't keep up with time. It was like pushing myself through a huge crowd and when i got out of the clog, POOF! guess what? i was having lunch with LOUISE. It was about time. First EMOTIONAL lunch i've had since we moved into RCBC. I never meant to hurt her. She didnt mean to hurt me. BUT hey it happened. Once issues were resolved, only then you realize how different people REALLY are and how important it is to respect every person despite such differences and the gaps they cause. In the end, only FORGIVENESS fills in those gaps. Nice to have you back in my life lil b!  Okay! so i wasnt really supposed to serve as "PLUS ONE" in the despedida/dinner for mother c. i called chris to tell her we can push through with dinner plans. It's about time we catch up on each other's highlights. First wide-awake recall of the kind of friendship that lasts. There in front of me was a friend whom i haven't seen for decades! Yet, we just took off where we left off. Longer hair and inches added to our girth aside, everything was pretty much the same. Eeeeghad. I'm hosting her wedding with chai in december. a far too EARLY booking eh? december or tomorrow, i really wouldn't mind. Hey chris! You've been too good and TOO TRUE, at the same time. Love you dearly.  Then guess who crashed dinner? another one of those long-staying personalities in my life. JASON M. the picture didnt entirely fit the usual frame of that jason aura. guess the CLOUD 9 smile made a difference. Reasons of which i refuse to divulge in this blog unless i wanna live shorter. haha. it was nice to see someone trying to keep it still and steady after doing boogie for a long time. Is it for real? Is this for good? Hell, i have no idea. I'm only sure it was a nice feeling to be THERE when an old best friend becomes what he wants to be. Or chooses someone. NOT QUITE but ALMOST there-- the moment when he thinks things seem to be HAPPENING for him. That's why i didnt say much when he was doin the tell. i refuse to pre-empt whatever best laid plans he had for himself and his future that awaits. You should know BETTER by now Jason. I dont question your prolonged presence in my life because even to this day, you seem to be the BIGGEST challenge for my capacity to FORGIVE and to have FAITH in friendships. Forgive YOU. Forgive OTHERS. Forgive MYSELF. It all comes in the same package. Quite a challenge if i must say. But you know what? After going through all the humps with you, anyone next should be EASY. a cinch. DAYM. Aren't you just too lucky to have me in your life despite all that? HARHAR. HEEEY! You know it's true. winks!  MIA!! i miss you too! PRADA naman? hmmmm.. you want a shopping companion next time? haha.  FRIENDS either make you or break you; bring out the BEST in you, sometimes the WORST in you. But when you think about it, deep down, and you realize at one point or another they help you KNOW who you really are and eventually help you become the BETTER person you WANNA BE, then you know they served their purpose. Sometimes too, in one of those rare chances... WHO HURTS you MOST.... will also HEAL you best. ESPECIALLY if that person is A FRIEND.  Am i the last person to see SPIDERMAN? I swear, next time.. harry! i will get the chance to see a good film before u do and it'll be my turn to haunt you! haha. Rudy and chy! good couple. good friends to me. now, "good ride!" congrats with the NEW ACQUISITION. hehe.  My nephew walks into my father's room and shares with him his breakfast. My dad goes... "san galing yan?" nephew replies, "TATAY! I dont understand you. It's ENGLISH day today! so... speak english!" KAYA natin yan DAD! HAHA... MY MORNING DELIGHT.  Happy weekend everyone!   01/july/04 i just ripped JUNE off my desk calendar. wow. half the year is OVER. NO BIGGIE. C'mon next half!!! If it's going to be as pleasant a surprise as walking out of the elevator neck being held hostaged by guess who!? PAUL! hahaha... i really wouldnt mind. It was nice to see an ol' friend.  After a seemingly month-long pigging out (literally!) on lechon, lechon kawali, liempo... i feel so bloated. who wouldn't be? time to brush fatty sweater off this glutton heart (yes, it's my heart that really has the passion for such!) and convert to a healthier diet. i'm eating oatmeal and bananas later. maybe for the rest of... the week (weekends excluded) hahaha. well... i'm just being honest. for sure i'll do something nice to myself this month. just "takin better care of my health", as how lambert and i put it. dude! how's ur healthier plan? winks!  Okay so i was an hour shy and short from the 9-hour sleep i was aiming for. 2200H. chris texted. inviting for lunch today, but i didnt think it was a good idea to cut the updates and storytellings short during lunch HOUR. (that reminds me! i still owe reychel a lunch rendezvous!) i texted back dinner on friday sounds better. saturday even. i'll be off laptop duty this month. woohoo! 2215H. trisha texted. bangkok acommodation suggestions for yvette. thanks dear! 2230H. it slipped my mind it's already july and we're supposed to change scheds. texted maritel. she was holding her post for an exam. yeah, training for amadeus (AIR FRANCE uses amadeus that's why) already began. I'm actually excited to learn 1000 plus entries in what? 4 days? wow. i'd be sitting in a classroom again and taking an exam come session-end. i like that. woohoo! (again!) i'll be taking last shift. that means more sleep for me huh? work begins at 0930H then. that's in about 3 minutes.... okay. this ends here. ;) BIG Marketing MAN from LONDON just walked in. Really nice man... so he gets an oreo from me. He said i should "stay slim??!" Hmmm.. i think he deserves the whole box of oreos if only for that. haha.  Hey ai! ill see you dinnertime. later girl. Fingers crossed that i get the EXTRA energy to pass by joice's place for my new cd. Can't wait to take that ALTERNATIVE lift. can i say this again? wooohooo! hah! i just did.  30/june/04 Okay. When i said i love this weather??... i didnt mean that the dark clouds be challenged and pour heavy rain all over. I only meant for the nice winds to stay. Oh well. There goes the compliment.  Yvette is leaving for Bangkok on sunday. Business trip. Gotta pull those connections to make it a breezy-trip for best friend. I think i am more excited than she is. Her first time, that's why i am the one more jittery than anyone else. I just finished writing my novel for her, more like a list of TRAVEL 101 stuff. That will come in handy i'm sure. Thea's reminders. Im so excited for her!!! did i say that already? haha.  TODAY, i want to sleep for at least 9 hrs; eat paquito's arroz caldo; listen to NICKELBACK or Third Eye Blind for a change; meet ula's ronron, yeehee! or angie's MOUSSA; pack for Yvette ( i love packing for trips); go for back rub or head to nail spa; do a lot of stretching; or yoga (it's been a looooong while); meet SOMEONE...oh and i want the rain to stop. Take care everyone.  29/june/04 I love this weather. windy and.... windy! reminds me so much of places out of the country. so to maximize the experience, i purposely didnt dry my hair and decided to wear my knee-length coat today. TUESDAY. mat's banned from the roads so i took the shuttle. guess whose it was. Jojo's. an old friend. husband of rhoda, a former high school mate, a year younger than i am. it was nice to bump into Dodie too right before leaving antipolo. Met 2 new people on my way to work - Hazel and Iban. Jojo's officemates. I see them in antipolo sometimes. They used to be just familiar faces to me, now they have names. Nice. Jojo asked why i haven't been seen around. well i bring mat almost everyday now that's why. I got off 2 blocks away from rcbc. so there was plenty of walking to do. it was a nice feeling. not close to Capetown, Africa but the whole walk to the office seemed a quiet and refreshing experience. (well i dont get to do it EVERYDAY). I was sort of thinking of a good place to go to for a vacation but somehow i was appreciating what i was doing for that particular moment. UCC, Seattle's Best, Oliver's...and the strip of good breakfast hang-outs seemed endless. Weird because i didn't find myself hungry at all. I was just overwhelmed by the walk itself (yes! in my 3-inch stiletto boots mind you! winks!) My mind was apparently preoccupied by the "sights to behold" but was taken away from it when manong guard greeted me good morning at the rcbc tower 1 lobby. i didnt recognize him. they rotate quite often. then again i must have passed by him in one of the other entrances since he said, "ma'am! wala kayong kakupas-kupas talaga." hahaha. that made me smile. apparently too, i woke up at the right side of the bed today-- being delightful at the simplest things around me. Quick and early chat with gerald. Morning greetings from migs and the news that he recently met two 22-year old dudes who both has a crush on me. DAW. Sheesh! I get older, they get younger??! WHeW! Burnt my toasts but i ate 'em just the same. Went well with smoked cheese from amsterdam. (thanks jenny!) I brought adobo to the office yesterday. Tina said there's longganisa (our favorite kind) for lunch today. HMMM! can't wait. No wild river or loop d' loops-kinda thing but... one hella experience. I have my bad days too but you know you're still generally and genuinely happy when you get moments like this. It's nice to be satisfied.  28/june/04 I woke up this morning not feeling well. I had several dreams which seemed vague to me last night. faces of friends and stories loose at the seams. Hmmm.. it seems too like I'm at that point again when i don't exactly know what to do to escalate my day to be at least better than my dreams. Then i thought this may be the best time to write. I know I am compelled to seize this dull moment and transform it to a roller-coaster ride. with double loops-- that which requires a brave shift. A moment that requires more colors like those of froot loops other than regular oatmeal or cornflake cereals. BUT NO. For a change, I just wanna close my eyes and wake up when it's over. TODAY, i don't want to take a leap. I don't want to wear orange. I don't want to transform anything but the color of my monitor screen from sky blue to moss green. I don't wanna do anything other than write. For the first time in a long time, i just wanna sit down and stare at anything blank. No other dramatic action other than breathing... and what a relief it's been so far. I'll do the bunjee-jumping tomorrow. Or the day after that. ANYTIME is good...but not TODAY. I had very brief UNBUSY moments today. THANKS for the short chat karen. Daph, i am ok. i brought mat today. I rarely take the mrt but GOD! i hope no one was hurt in the electrical blast. thanks for checking on me though. so sweet of you. I finally finished reading FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN. i wonder... whose lives i have affected and whose others did mine. SIGNIFICANTLY that is. DULL day turns reflective. Blame it on Mitch. Well, it still is a BETTER ending, not BITTER. Nothing beats bad traffic better than good company. It was nice going home with best friend ting.  The song changed. "wish you would step down from that ledge my friend. We could cut ties from all the lies that you've been living in. And if you do not want to see me again, I will understand." - JUMPER by Third Eye Blind.  Been dying to hear this song for days!!! I heard it tonight, right before getting out of the car. The last song i heard today. LAST. But it had all the sense i needed.  23/june/04 He's been a good friend. Loyal to himself and those he loves...aight nina? ("ninya") winks! He sticks to what he believes is right despite what others think... always hungry at breakfast! HAPPY BDAY JASON BUERA! dingdong! I wish you happiness, good health, fortune, seamless and worry-free wedding preps, and lots of kids to party for! harhar.  19/june/04 HAPPY BDAY TO MOMMY LITA MALIKSI (Ting's mom; one of the many 2nd moms that i have) AND MILLET ZUMEL, my ever reliable GLOBE friend. Well she's more than that. She makes up for all of other's GLOBE's flaws. NANAY to GLOBE colleagues...very good friend to me since high school. miss you letot! WOW. I called her to surprise her with my greeting and guess who got surprised? Antipolo, LAOAG or anywhere beyond and between... i will see you on your wedding day girl. 25th July. Grabe... it really is weng all along.  19/june/04 I got my 1st DRIVING VIOLATION TODAY. Well, almost. I was set on leaving office at 12sharp til i got a call from this PLATINUM PLAN person saying i was chosen to be a lucky recipient of a 100K accident insurance plan with a privilege card to go. I wasnt really bent on going since i knew they would be selling me other products once i present myself to their office. Well, ULA suggested i go to at least avail of the freebie.  urlLink    With Ula (new officemate...new friend!)  urlLink     She had a point. So i went. This officer took eternity to try to sell to me this trust fund scheme they're promoting. in fairness, the concept was good. Unfortunately, he was selling it to someone with 480 bucks between her and poverty. Yeah! that's all my wallet had at lunch time. I was running late, obviously!!! for a 1230 appointment. It's a saturday... daym! who would have expected MMDA to be working their butts off!? well, maybe i never really noticed. EDSA was almost clear... driving. 60kph...80kph...(didnt i say i was running late!) and...VOILA!!! there was this officer hailing me to pull over. darn it. He was giving me his homily w/c seemed threatening for a first-timer, amateur....idiot like me. He got my license w/c by the way isnt the plastic card yet. Then he noticed... i havent even signed it. Did i mention i was an idiot? oh well... there. I retrieved my license and looked at the officer straight in the eyes and smiled coyly. It really was an honest offense. I was turning right to edsa central but i got a lil too advanced sticking to the middle lane i actually crossed over the boundary for PUVs!!! slight and really tolerable offense he said. After ten thousand pleas and smiles... whew! the officer released me!!! he was sooooooooooo nice! He even said if i get caught again along edsa, i can look for him. wheeeeeew! (not that i have any intentions of committing another offense, honest or otherwise.) huhuhuhu! i almost had my license FRAMED today. so that's how it feels...  So dead tired. LONG DAY. HEy! have you guys seen this game called slamball!? i forgot which channel but it's so kewl! hmpf! MMDA officer was waaaaaaaay cooler though! winks!  I was checking out this dude who was having his expedition's glass plates done right next to mat. Carlos Agassi type. I gave up after 2 glances. Along marcos highway, i saw 2 other dudes at this very cozy car wash station. I was gonna have mat washed too but when i saw the mud and dirt uphill, i knew it would be pointless....oh! the better-looking dude was also glued to his phone. Hmmmm... i'm sure he was talking to girlfriend. so, i left and headed home.  told ya... i was tired. good night people! "THE RING" is showing on HBO...hmmm.. pass! i dont wanna be sleeping with eyes wide-open. nye!  urlLink    B in B! (Bored in Banaue)  urlLink     18/june/04 HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAPHNE! What's up with you girl!? Charry... thanks for the chica. At least i was 'entertained' via phone while i was working on MAT's pestering moods. window rolled down by itself!  Macie... you are always free to laze ur eyes (and butt) within my blog. ANYTIME.  It's FRIDAY PEOPLE! I am so i the mood for some groovin' and well even lounging with good ol' friends will do. Now i gotta make those calls. Who wants to join!? haha! I wanna go to peligro.. (spell!?) they play trance music there. i heard. i hope bech and russ tag me along.  My good friend ai (from I3Block) called yday to tell me my invitation is on the way. Ai and Ryan. tying the knot. 10th of july. GOD! how time flies. She was upset...no! freakin out is the term... so many disastrous events during all her wedding preparations. hmmm... feeling kinda guilty i haven't even contributed anything to those preparations yet. well, who knows? i promised to see her next week though. I WONDER WHEN I WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PREDICAMENT. Hmm... one step at a time i told myself. Gotta dredge up the inspiration to write that article to my-man-to-be. then get a boyfriend. then get married... i mean BE MERRY! harharhar! who am i kidding!?!   urlLink    ai and ryan. lovely couple...dont u think!? CHEERS!  urlLink     HAVE A FAB WEEKEND EVERYONE!  17/june/04 Thoughts while driving.  "Whatever makes you happy, whatever makes you beautiful. What you want you already got, but you already died." That was the song i was listening to this morning. morbid i thought. alternative. forgot the artist's name. title is "whatever." Then again, i loved it. I wish i'd hear it again.  So as a note to myself, "Whatever i find on my plate today, i will take time to enjoy like it's the last serving i'll ever have." That was supposed to be metaphorical... but damn. Now i'm hungry.  My bro-in-law was asking me about my dates this morning. Gave me lil reminders and stuff. kiddingly said i should marry someone filthy rich. joke was half-meant i suppose. hahaha. asked me if there's anyone i fancy as of the moment. then approached a black lancer w/o tint with a guy driving. w/o shirt on. tshirt was hanging loose on his shoulder. "brusco," he said. "type ko," was my reply. see? i still know what type i want. that car... w/ a man like that on board. pardon the humor of a 27-year old single woman.

      I am not a writer. Not by profession. I do love living to the point that it never seems enough to just write something about it- pleasant or otherwise. When I write, I live twice. So this is my way of reliving the experience, not exactly as how it happened, but somewhat more like how it felt.  Between you and me, I never really mind being single. Contrary to a reader’s expectations, I am a highly extrovert person that I always find myself in the middle of groups, parties and whatever social function that requires some kind of life to fill up the room. However, when a situation calls for independence, I can easily toss the party hats and high heels out the window and subscribe to the momentary calling. effortlessly. Until of course recently when I realized that ‘momentary’ seems to be approaching infinity.  Give me a little credit. It’s not like I haven’t taken the big leap. I have, although in most occasions only landed with either an empty bank account or a  broken heart.  Unfortunately so. This is one department where my heart seems to never agree with my mind. When my heart tells me to dredge up the courage and give the man-of-the-moment a chance, my brain tells me to run away and just leave things which I will possibly screw up. I don’t even allow myself to be courted. Thus the, “first dates.” FIRST because the counting stops at one. No point of going for my supposedly hearty second serving since I usually know there ain’t gonna be any future after the dinner. I am 27 years and 10 months too late to be writing a coming-out-of-age article. I write now in an attempt to question what I believed all this time.  I went out with someone last saturday, in my greatest desire to escalate from the mere occupation of “dating” (that’s still not paying highly enough), with the eternal hope of bumping into MR. RIGHT in the process. Be he my date, the man next to our table or heaven forbid, the man who grabbed the purse of the woman standing across the street hailing for a cab. He was smart just like the others; can carry conversations just like the others; and polite, generous and much of a gentleman, maybe even more than the others. He did the sweetest thing of following me back home despite the fact that it was unquestionably out of the way, and the fact that I assured him that I’ll be okay driving by myself. He followed, not so much the instructions, but my car until I reached Antipolo town proper. Just like some of my past dates, it was inevitable to be asking about past relationships. This man has been into a real bad break-up. Not a charity case, excuse me but that just got to me. Given the predominant feeling being just casual and not the expected magical, whimsical or head-swinging-and-tummy-upside-down kind of reaction, I stepped on my breaks right away. Then I realized why. WHY I’m still single.   Despite the high levels of confidence and strong character that pump through my nerves in the daily grinds of life, I was never born to take risks on love. Not with someone who is married, in a relationship (steady or cooling off both counted!) or any other category that classifies him as “taken”. I never find it amusing to take on a broken heart as a prey for my FIRST ever official relationship only to rip it open and into pieces once more, only because I was not sure of what I was getting myself into. Being at the ugly end of WAITING preceded by my unlucky 13 years of expecting the better coming out of the good in 2 relationships, I think it’s quite normal to be refusing to take on the role of the one making another person wait and hurt, specifically in that order.  Neither did it suit me nor did the wounds heal easily when they happened for me so I don’t suppose they will to another human being.  It takes too short a time to fall in love yet the longest time to forget. That’s what I am afraid of. That’s what I don’t wanna be taking the BIG LEAP for. Call me coward I don’t even care.  Unless I find the man who I will be certain to love without reservations and questions, then I don’t think I am bound to change my mind, or have a change of heart.  I can’t, so I won’t.  I just don’t think I am capable of hurting someone, so I would normally just give up the chance with all the negative possibilities of being the one to do it, unless I am sure that he is the one.   Even after a first date, I know I’m NOT supposed to feel the grandeur of excitement, wild adrenalin rush right away, but I ought to feel AT LEAST a heartbeat. A tickle under my pulse that would let me loosen my grip to this belief in NOT taking the risks.  I’m so afraid of not getting it altogether soon; of not finding the right one but I am more afraid of being that ONE person that somebody might just regret-- for hurting him, for leading him on, or even for doing it for the wrong reasons. Now, is that a crime?  At my age, I don’t think love is something we can refer to as a game so don’t expect me to gamble.  Or a finish line, so don’t expect me to rush running towards it.  My faith tells me there’s got to be ONE man out there. As long as that faith is alive, I refuse to call the others as OPTIONS.  Not yet.  THIS IS HOW WRITING REMINDS ME.

      Someone.  I am back. I thought for a while it’s been only a week since I wrote you my very first letter. Well. I have my reasons. It took a longer while for the emotions to sink in and the warm responses from anonymous visitors to get my brain out of the loop. I realized I was writing to just one person, and yet a number of others, now have joined the anticipation…of my letters. I hope you don’t mind the “extended visits.” Those aside, these letters remain YOURS. This being my second letter makes it some sort of a "reunion." Frankly speaking, i would never trade off this chance with anything else, not even what's behind door no 2 (although both exudes so much uncertainty.) It makes me less of the adventurous person that i am i guess. I'd choose you. No brainer. So what do i tell you in the course of my brief return? Let's take it from the 1st missive. Only this time, let's inject in a lighter and happier tone.  I've been goin out. Intensively. winks! As i meet more men, i continue to get the pieces altogether. The picture of the man that you are, the man that i want to be with has become clearer over time. You don't really have to live up to the image of Paul Walker. (yea, it is perfectly okay!) I would be untruthful if i say that i do not wish to wake up beside a face like that but at least i hope that the looks would be just as hmmm... what's the word again? SUAVE. You don't have to be as admirable as Nelson Mandala but at im pretty sure you would have your own way of sweeping me off my feet, (esp if i like you, you just have to BREATHE! yeeha!); not as intellectual as to the point of qualifying in MENSA but you are presumed to be able to participate in sensible conversations but will also be able to unleash humor when necessary (like i dont have to nudge you or press ur buzzer just so you would talk) . I would love to be laughing my heart out. It has become an essential past time. Just the same, i look forward to seeing you express yourself, as much as i do my own struts.  I dont like eggplants, tomatoes (served whole or sliced) and anything slimy, slippery and with seeds. I hate pink (was influenced over the years!) or anything barbie-ish! I hate math unless it somehow involves counting shopping bags or incoming cash. I detest looking for directions. I would gladly construct my own geographical map in order to find directions. That or i'd rather be "passenger," unless it's a new destination where i would find myself awed rather than 'lost.' Anything we have in common? Oh! but i love a man wearing pink shirts.... pink is good as long as it's not on me. OR ANY GIRL.  I just gave it away. the basics of thea. No rules. we live it one day at a time. If you want your private space, i will understand. Should you wish to spend time with your other friends, i'll find it under "normal circumstances." i don't expect you to be my shadow so live your day the way you want it to be. I at least hope you to be there when i need a comforting hug or a word of encouragement when my bad days are predominant (they're very rare though!) Isn't that what matters? that we are there for each other esp when no one else is? Relationships should allow couples to GROW, not be restricted. in all sense. Unless it does either of us or the relationship more harm than good, then anything is welcome. No room for pride though. It's the VERY ONE THING i refuse to be up against. Oh yeah, that and indifference. Be mad, be furious, be irritatingly ecstatic...anything as long as it involves at least a single proof of emotion.  How was your weekend? Mine was pretty exhausting. Do you ever wonder when our FIRST weekend will be?  I do.  *have you read the  urlLink FIRST LETTER?
