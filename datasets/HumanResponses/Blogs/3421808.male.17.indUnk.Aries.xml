      And so, less than a week later, the world of sports that had seemed so full of good, so full of positive energy and opportunties for glory to those who deserve it, has turned against me.  The Rangers lost their third straight, the T-Wolves are on the verge of extinction at the hands of the Lakers who I will always hate for all time more than any other team with the exception of the Yankees, who beat the crap out of whoever it was they were playing last night 18-5.  When the Lakers and the Yankees are a distant memory in the cellar of their respective sports, and better yet, when the Rangers as well as all teams from the Midwest triumph over the evil "big market" empires, the world of sports will finally be worth something.  Until then, I will simply have to wait and hope that justice finds a way, and/or that Phil Jackson and George Steinbrenner find a way to kick the bucket in the near future.  In other news, I beat Final Fantasy X last night in a somewhat successful attempt at self-consolation, taking my frustations out on the evil Yu Yevon with a flurry of Ultima Doublecasts, Zombie Attacks, and Banishing Blade Overdrives.  Yeah, I rule.

      I'm not sure what I have to talk about really.  I just wanted to have one more blog than Ki, making me the second-most active blogger and securing my role as the person who honestly has nothing productive to do at any given moment.  Seriously, I have only two teachers who haven't given up on teaching.  We've watched clips of war movies in English, watched Gattaca in Bio, and have finished The Candidate in Government.  We started All The President's Men yesterday in the same class.   Meansterwhilst, phy ed has made me realize how much I miss baseball.  We're actually doing slo-pitch softball, but it's close enough to the same thing.  It feels good playing first base again.  Damn coaches.  Ruined the whole sport for the Evan.  And, of course, the Twins have decided to drop a bunch of games to the Chi-Sox, and then promptly lost to Tampa Bay, meaning even being a fan is being made slightly more difficult.  How does last year's Al Central champion lose to Tampa Bay?  I don't understand how it's physiologically, philosophically, economically, spiritually possible.  Tampa sucks!

      And there the hell wasn't Mo.    The fact that Maury still hasn't posted, much less accepted my invitation to sign up as a contributor, is absolute bullshit.   In the spirit of Mo, I'd like to point out a discovery I recently made.  If you're in dire need of Count Chocula, but none is available, combine Lucky Charms with Chocolate Milk.  The result is a cheap substitute, but one that does the job nonetheless.

      So I'm chilling out last night, talking with Liesel, when I hear my cell phone ringing.  I manage to find my cell phone but don't answer in time.  I see the call came from the family cell phone back in EC, and try calling back.  After several rings, somebody picks up the line, I hear static, then a half second of some kind of screaming noise, then the line goes dead.  The scream kinda sounds like Ki.  I try calling back.  No answer, straight to voice mail.  My imagination does a one and half gainer.  Suddenly I'm picturing Ki being attacked in the middle of God knows where, by God knows who, and she's already tried to call home but nobody's there, so the next number she thought of was mine.  She tried to scream for help seconds after being taken to the ground, the cell phone ripped out of her hands, and she's now being dragged off into the woods never to be seen from again.  The call she'll ever make was to my cell phone and I missed the call.    And I realize, somewhere in the way back of my brain, that I may be in for a bit of therapy.  I try calling again.  Ring.  Ring.  Ring.  Finally, somebody picks up.  Lots of weird noises like somebody dropped the phone and is now fumbling with it.    "Hello?" I say.  Nothing.  "Hello?  Hello?!  HELLO?"  Nothing.  Suddenly the other end crackles to life.  Someone is screaming at the top of their lungs.  "HELLO!!!  HELLO!!!"  "HELLO!!" I scream back.  "HELLO!!!" a voice continues to scream, and I'm pretty sure it's Ki.  She apparently can't hear me.  "HELLO!!!  HELLO!!!"  "HELLO!" I shout back.  And finally she can hear me.  "Oh!  Hi!" says Ki.  "What the hell is the matter with you?" I ask, confused out of my mind.  "Sorry!" she says.  The connections not great, but I hear a lot of noise in the background, and it sounds like Ki is with some friends.  "Are you drunk?" I ask, the only logical explanation that I can think of.  "No!!  Um, can you tape The Shield?"  "Okay.  Where are you?  Aren't you missing 24?"  "I'm taping it.  I'm with company."  "Uh, okay."  The conversation pretty much ends after that.  Then I see a voice mail pop up, one that Ki must have left on her first try.  I then listen to Ki and some random people screaming/laughing/cavorting on the other end for about three seconds, with no intelligible words said.  Then silence.  Okay, so I taped The Shield.  And now Ki, we await your next entry as you explain just what the hell was going on last night.

      Last week I experienced just about every driving mishap just short of an accident or ticket. I don't know if I was just insanely unlucky or insanely lucky, you decide. I'll start first with my trip to Minneapolis. I'm taking my friend Jessica from San Francisco to the Mall of America. We just get on the highway and it starts raining. No huge deal, just a bit annoying. Then construction hits--We're down to two lanes, one in either direction with naught but a row of thin cones between them. So that's a bit nerve-wracking. Now Jessica is scared of storms, this kind of traffic, and as I soon found out, moths. Somehow a moth got into the car and starts flying back and forth in the front seats. I thought I hated moths, but Jessica flips out and starts screaming for me to kill it. There is no place to pull over, I'm in jam packed traffic on a fast moving highway while it's raining. How I'm supposed to kill a moth is beyond me. So I roll down the windows, and resist my urges to freak out whenever the moth comes near me. Finally, the moth disappears. Whew. However, fun is not over. After the Mall, I'm driving back when I run into more construction which causes poorly marked signs and I'm unable to get over to my exit in time for the freeway. So I take another highway going east which causes about an extra half hour of driving time, but that's okay. Anyway, so I call home to find out exactly how to get back using this alternative route and just as I hang up the phone, something rises from the dashboard. "THE MOTH IS BACK!" It's raining, it's dark, it's a winding road, and then let's throw in a ringing cell phone and shrieking passenger. Somehow I answer the phone, but I am laughing too hard at my near-tears friend to say anything else to my father who is telling me to watch out for deer. Lord knows what he thinks is going on. The moth is really crazy this time, too--and consequently so is Jessica. Luckily, this time I can pull over. I pull over, face my fear and throw the moth out of the car. Then I realize, I pulled over into a mess of cow manure. Oh yay. So I pull back onto the highway w/ a stinky car. I'm frazzled. Jess and I both just sit in a frazzled state for about ten minutes listening to David Bowie until I see some flashing lights in my rearview mirror. Oh dear. I have never been pulled over in my life. So I freak out as the officer comes to the car and asks for my license. He's actually pretty darn nice. He asks how I say my name. And then he tells me the town I just drove through has a 30 speedlimit and I was going 45. I explain I thought it was 40 and that I'm frazzled and lost, trying to get back from Minneapolis. He asks if I'm on vacation. I say I live in Eau Claire, yah-dee-yah-dah, and he goes to his car for about five minutes. When he returns, he tells me I'm only getting a warning but "Next time in Durand, 30 all the way." I say okay and thank you and finally get home. Rain, construction, moths, poo, and police--and that was only half of my driving mishaps...(to be continued in next Blog).

      I have finished a long year, full of grueling work, late nights, and occasionally impossible teachers. Now I'm home for a few weeks, and what do I do? Do I recuperate by sleeping a lot, listen to music, lounge, hang out with friends I haven't seen for months, watch movies, or read pleasurable not-text-book books? Well, let's use the events of my day today as an indicator. I got up at 8 a.m., dressed, ate breakfast, and went to American Title & Abstract Co. When I arrived, I did a little filing before proceeding to shred papers for almost an hour. Then I drove down to the Register of Deeds at the courthouse where I made a list BY HAND of all the subdivisions of land in Eau Claire COUNTY. Then I had a lunch break during which I filled a prescription, bought some underwear and a Father's Day card. I ate lunch, did dishes, and then headed back to American Title where I am now. I have been typing at the computer for the past three hours--inputting into the American Title system the names of all the subdivisions that I spent the past two days hand-writing. Hmm... is this what summer vacation is all about? NO. I think I should go up to my boss, say, "Sorry, but this is bullshit" and leave. Well, I probably won't...but hey, that's what a pirate would do.

      I was a film junky this weekend.  That felt so good.  I saw 3 movies in as many days.  It was gloriously unproductive.  The Last Samurai was all right, although I think Moe is more accurate in his retitling,  "Japan-ces with Wolves" and some stuff seemed a little pirated from Glory(i.e. firing a gun at a trooper to show the pressure of reloading a musket mid-battle.)  Then I saw Dawn of the Dead.  That was fun.  Ridiculously absurd, no doubt, but still gruesomely enjoyable.  Finally, Shrek 2.  Roughly as amusing as the first, Antonio Banderas was easily the funniest thing about it.  He was hilarious.  All in all a guilty pleasure movie, though, with all the childish humor.   The Boy was sedentary this weekend, and that's just one of those things that you know is wrong, but feels so right.  In fact, I think I'll go be sedentary some more with an episode of West Wing.  Maybe with a beverage.  Yeah...

      Today, the Texas Rangers came back in the bottom of the ninth to beat the New York Yankees with a walk-off home run.  Is there anything sweeter than the walk-off victory?  Is there anything sweeter than beating the #@$! Yankees?  Is there anything sweeter than Alex Rodriguez, who defected from the Rangers to the Yankees so he could play for a "winning" team, coming back to play Texas and making a critical error in the bottom of the eighth that allowed Texas to tie the game and ultimately led to the Yankees loss?  The curse of A-Rod is real, folks, and I for one could not feel sorrier for the richest player to ever put on a major league uniform.  Tomorrow, Texas goes for the sweep - if they win, I might just have to crack open a cold one.    And if the T-Wolves end up beating the Lakers tomorrow - I might just crack open two.

      I'll bet that no one reading this has ever contemplated the many uses of Jenga blocks.  Sure, you might have used them in the traditional way, as the instructions detail.  However, I have a friend who excels at fun but useless endeavors(you should see him juggle) and has built many an elaborate tower or castle from such blocks.  It is absolutely mindblowing to watch.  He even brought a bag of about 5 sets to the choir pops concert, and we sat there in the band pit and built a really tall tower in between numbers that we were to play on.  These wonder wood blocks also make excellent projectiles when snowballs or oatmeal are not on hand.  Aaah, Jenga blocks.  Is there nothing they can't do?

      This is the first post here on this site.  First one.  Ever.  There can never be another first one.  This is it.  So whatever is said here is certainly going to be something of epic and profound proportions.  With any luck, this site will become the home of many a thought-provoking pontification by either me, Mo, Ki or Ev, essays that promote intelligent discourse and lively debate.  And so it is in this spirit that I give you this groundbreaking item:  I love pastrami.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why I've lived a quarter of a century without being exposed to a pastrami sandwich, but my time of ignorance is now over.  And I must say, it's a full-fledged conversion.  I am a believer in the pastrami.  The merits of pastrami are great and they are many, and most of them concern the taste and how it's really friggin' good.  It still comes in second to bacon, but...wait.  just. a minute.  I have just had a vision, and it is good.  Pastrami and bacon.  Together.  Lying together in sanctimonious union, between two soft pieces of Seven Grain Bread.  Has it ever been done?  If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say no.  Will I be the first to do it?  Yes.  And will I report back on my finding on what will probably be the Holy Grail of all sandwiches?  Probably.  However...there's always the chance it would be better on a slightly toasted pumpernickel.

        I have another day and a half hurr in Yurrp, and I am looking forward to coming home.  I have managed to find present-gift-type things for everybuggy, although it was made more difficult by the fact that the Hi Fi has already been here and covered the beer stein and conversation hat route.     Anywho, Anne's younger sister is back from England, and she tends to Bogart the computer back at Anne's, so using a computer has becoming a little harder.  Luckily, it turned out not to matter because I haven't heard from anyone since Saturday.  But das okay,'cuz I'll be home soon.  Yay!     Now then, as it is the most convenient way of going about talking about my trip, I will present yet another list, this time of things that I'm going to enjoy when I get home.  1)My room.  I miss it a lot.   1a)My stereo.  I've had to make do with my discman, and it just isn't the same.     1b)My bed.  My feet hang off the edge of my bed here, and it's a single.  2)The English language.  Talking requires so much thought here.  Although I did have a cool conversation with Anne's dad about music.  He's a pretty big classic rock/soul fan, so when we went to this Italian place to eat last night, he started talking about Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding.  Anne and her sister are more of hip-hop/pop crap fans, so they looked bored, but Anne's dad was loving it.  I realize I wandered a ways off subject, but that anecdote seemed right.   2a)Also, TV and movies in English will be fun.  I think my host family wonders why I don't watch TV except for soccer games, but it's just 'cuz I don't understand them. 3)Driving.  Specifically on roads and stuff that make sense.  Most streets around here are only wide enough for 1 1/2 cars.  And their stop lights go from red to yellow to green.  And they can't turn right on red.  It's also a little surreal to see speed limit signs that say 130, until you think that it's in kilometer per hour.  And gas here is ridiculous.  It seems cheap when you see a sign that says $1.05, until you realize that's per liter, not gallon.  This leads me to the next thing I miss. 4)The English system of measurement.  I know that the metric system makes more sense, but I can't get used to it.   5)Our computer.  Around here, every so often, the computer gives me some warning that I don't understand.  I haven't made any computers explode, but I don't know how long I can trust my luck.  Also, I miss our keyboards. 6)Milk.  These people never drink milk.  I wouldn't get any if I didn't have cereal in the morning, and no one else here eats cereal. I can feel the osteoporosis setting in.  7)Smoke-free restaurants and other such public places.  I've smoked about 3 cartons since coming here, all in secondhand smoke.   Okay, I think that'll do for now.  I'm sure there are other things, but I still have a bit more time here, and I'd like to enjoy it, at least a little.  Next time I blog, I'll be back in the USA.  Wahoo!  The Boy

      I just sent a long group email to y'all, so I won't bother with a lot of Germany details this time.  However, I do have an excellent story about how I got got in the weirdest way ever. To begin with, let me simply say that disposable cameras can be dangerous.  Or really fun.  Or both at the same time.  We took a coach bus to Sinsheim and Heidelberg yesterday, and people are prone to boredom while riding a bus for 2 or 3 hours.  I'll use their names as much as possible, because it just makes it easier.  Frank had a used-up disposable camera, and one girl on this trip, Mary(who Kila knows), works at Sharp photo, so she knows how to take the film and battery out of disposable cameras.  Once the film was secured, Frank and two others, Ian and Mark, were free to take the camera apart and futz around with it.  This included removing the plastic stuff covering the flash mechanism and circuit board.  They discovered that, by charging the flash, an electric shock can be delivered via the metal contacts on the circuit board.  They accidentally shocked themselves, then, in typical guy fashion, decided to see if they could "get" someone.  I was asleep, and in the general vicinity, so I was it.  They charged the flash and touched about 4 metal contacts to the back of my hand.     What happened next was very surreal, given I had fallen asleep listening to Audioslave.  There was a horrible buzzing noise, the smell of ozone, and the most horrible burning pain.  I thought someone was using an electric razor to sever my left hand just above the wrist.  I jolted up, bellowing, sometimes profanely, sometimes incoherently, sometimes, with threats of castration.  But after I had calmed down, I had to admit that they got me pretty good, I had utterly lost my cool, and I had 4 cool marks where the camera fried my hand.  They do look pretty B.A.  But they're starting to fade, but I might have a few little dot things to remind me of it.     The moral of the story:  electrocution is an excellent way to wake someone expeditiously.  Now I'm off to Frankfurt.  Gurbye!  The Boy

      Okay, contrary to what that last entry may have indicated, I did not just smoke a whole lot of dope.  However, am currently sitting down to blog with beer in hand, a bottle of Sam Adams which I mistakenly took to be a twist off.  That hurt a little bit but I'm okay.  So what's been happening?  Let's see here.  Well, first there's the fact that I won't be coming home for Dad's birthday after all.  That sucks.  I'm going to try to reschedule for the second week of August though, so mark yer calendars.  Also, been doing a little bit of hob-nobbing thanks to being able to bask in reflected glory of my boss.  I am now the proud owner of a VIP pass for the LA Film Festival, which means I can go to whatever I want and go wherever I want, for free, and people must worship me when they see me.  Apparently this pass would ordinarily cost $1000.  Freakin' A.  Yeah, so now I just flash this thing that's hanging around my neck, Wayne & Garth style, and get to feel important.  Monday night Liesel and I went to a Reception hosted by Samuel L. Jackson, and got to drink for free and take home gift bags full of free stuff.  Then we went to a "Secret Screening" that only VIPs can get into.  Plus you sign something saying you won't talk about it, or else you get ruined.  So technically, I can't say what I saw.  But I can say what I didn't see, and that was Spiderman 2, which I was naively hoping it would be.  I can also say that what I didn't see was an American movie, and that I didn't see a musical, so that was good. Also, it is a movie that at least Maury must definitely see - I will say no more in case Big Brother is watching, but maybe more private conversations can be had elsewhere (although they certainly wouldn't be about the secret screening, Big Brother).  Anyway, more stuff is on the way, and I will try to feel as cool as possible while doing it all, up until the moment I realize that my fly has been open the entire night.  One other thing that I never mentioned, and should have.  I met Vincent Spano.  I don't need to tell anybody who is familiar with the film "Oscar" who that is.  He's really nice, funny, outgoing, in fact, he's seems very similar to the character he plays in the movie.  Anyway, he's also into TM and a big fan of David, which means I probably haven't seen the last of him.  This is good, because I still haven't gotten up the nerve to sneak Oscar into a conversation with him, and tell him how much ass he kicked in that movie, especially in the piano playing scene.    Okay, das enough for now.  I am extremely humbled and impressed by the superior quality of everyone else's posts - one of these days we need to get into an extremely heated back and forth via the comments section, something where the comments string for one post becomes 100 long or so because things are being said and nobody can let it go.  Soon, I predict this will come to pass.  I'm finished now, Jay

      Suddenly, Jay thought he could go all auto-mechanic on the blog, and just not care.  Turn his back on the blog, would he?  The Blog would show him.  And show him it did.    Yes, late Tuesday night, as I slept soundlly in my bed, when suddenly BAM!!!!!  In the side of the face....and it was STINGING!  What the hell?  And I turned on the light and looked around the room with my one good eye.  Nothing.  But suddenly I knew.  The Blog!  The Blog had hit me in the side of the face with a slushball!!  In the middle of June!!  In L.A.!!    And I remember thinking, "Damn.  This must have taken some serious planning."    For not only had the blog had the foresight to somehow gather snow from another area of the state, but the blog must have done it during the months of winter, before I EVEN STARTED UP THE BLOG!?  Truly a hair-raising notion.  And so I realized, as the juice from the slushball ran down my side and settled into my underpants, that I had it all wrong.  We don't choose our blogs.  Our blogs choose us.  I forsook my blog.  And I paid a terrible, terrible price.  I fear next time it will be eggs, and holy geez do I not want to take an egg in the face at 3:00am.  So take heed, younger siblings, and learn from my transgression.  You don't want the blog to consider you a Gunky.

      OK. So my summer has been me living the simple life. Books and art, with a 9-11 hour workday of hard construction-style labor. ...woah. theres this hella thunderstorm going on right now, and the lights in the office where I'm typing just flickered. I might not live through this blog.  But speaking of not living. I was roofing today when this dude (and by dude I do mean it.) Tony Navar who is Raney's other guy that works with us took a tumble off the roof. Tony is an alpha male, to quote Joel Raney. He lifts more than he should, just cause, drinks cans of pop empty without taking his mouth away once and in about 9 seconds, tells us to check out his shingling job he just finished and asks us, "isn't that just sexy?" and has shoulder hair. Nonetheless, I can't help but like him since he is always jovial, nice and cheerful, and appreciates people who, understandably, don't act like him. So that's Tony's intro.  But his fall is funnier. At one an a half stories, he was on the tip of ladder under enough stress that is started bending. But as he dismantled a gutter, he remained calm. Until the ladder tips popped off and he went down with the ladder. Now I've wondered what an unexpected fall from 18 feet or so would do to someone on, say grass. Would you be OK? Ribs bruise? Leg twist or break? But Tony managed to fall half on a buncha rocks around some bushes and half on cement sidewalk with bricks on it. He lay in a heap, and just smiled. Refusing to give in that that may or may not have come with paralysis to go with that pool of blood, but also unable to deny that he couldn't speek for lack of breath. In the end  he wrapped his torn limbs and went back to work a bit later. Lesson learned? It's funny cause it wasn't me. And it nearly was me, since I had a Frodo in the Dead Marshes moment. I felt eerily compelled to walk to the edge of the roof and look over.  As I did, I fell into a sort of trance, and felt myself uncontrollably being pulled over it. But just before I tumbled, Gollum grabbed me, and I said, "Gollum?" in disbelief. Well, I didn't almost fall, but I still got a little dizzy and scared myself into sitting down quick before I slumped over the edge onto a lawn gnome.  Boy, it's ever interesting to hear about your Germany 'ventures. Keep on keepin' on. That's fine that you don't like beer, too. I didn't like it until I went to Australia and it was as common place to consume that we Americans consider, oh say, air to be. And way not to conform to the club it up and get wasted everynight thing. A lot of kids wanted to do that too, when I went abroad. So I checked in with them when I felt like it, and otherwise did my own thing. You've chosen bar games (nice shooting at billiards), local townsy appreciation, and ice cream, and I chose SCUBA diving, hiking, and occasional glimpses of "the light at the end of the tunnel".  Ki, you're moron friend needs to stop sucking so I can get my DVD back. Or I need to stop sucking and get some mob affiliations so I can "reclaim" it and get a little "interest" too. heh heh But I'm glad camp is cool. I'd like to pretend I was 8 at summer camp instead of feeling 80 and at a concentration camp (which is very akin to roofing, I figure).  Jay, that sucks you can't visit on the 4th. But Mom told me you get to be Production Manager on the commercial shoot. And that doesn't suck. still, hopefully you can come here before too long.  Hey, know what you could do if you were bored and tired and felt like annoying people one day? You should say "Oh my GOD,...." before everything you say to everyone until people finally feel awkwardly compelled to tell you to please stop. I don't know why that just came to me.   I'm off to kill now. brother lovingly, Maury

      I'm noticing a distinct lack of bloggage.  I'm very disappointed.  But, I'll continue to hold up my end of the blog deal.  Specifically by blogging.  I've decided to compile a small list of pros and cons about Germany, things that are good, and things that aren't...as good.  Hurr goes.  Things That Evan Thinks Are A'ight 1) Ice Cream.  Awesome stuff. 2) Prezels.  The big soft ones.  Oh man, that's good. 3) Movie theaters.  Despite the fact that they're all in German, these theaters are so comfy.  And they have vendors selling the awesome ice cream just before the movie starts.  It's almost like a baseball game. 4) Bogart's.  Nifty pool hall and bar.  Location of my awesome game-winning shot, among others of the billiard room-type games that Evan likes so much. 5) Refering to Evan in the 3rd person.(although this has little to do with Germany) 6) Craaaaazy ping pongin'. 7) The fact that I'm about 8 in. taller and weigh about 60 lbs. more than almost anyone around here. 8) The field behind my house, that I have a view of from my balcony.  It's like something out of old romance movies, where a guy and a girl are running toward each other in slow mo, with swelling, triumphant music in the background.  Things that Evan Doesn't Think ARe A'ight 1)Carbonated Water.  It's like drinking salt. 2)Germans who don't understand said lack of appreciation of carbonated water. 3)The fact that every ceiling and light is too low for me.  I've hit my head on every light in this house, and I always have to tilt my head when riding in most cars. 4)The fact that the majority of Americans on this trip are only here to go to clubs and get trashed nightly. 5)The moron Americans who decided to pick up smoking while here. 6)The constant smell of cigarette smoke no matter where you go. 7)The gi-normous canker sore that's been sitting on my cheek for almost 2 weeks. 8)The fact that every shop I see has the same souvenir beer steins, and little else. 9)The exceeding narrowness of the streets/sidewalks. 10)The keyboards.  But I'm getting used to them. 11)The insistance of most cashiers that I pay in exact change, despite the fact that ATM's here give me a bunch of 50's that are apparently not accepted unless you buy 50 euros worth of stuff.  Things that Evan is okay with, he supposes... 1)Host family.  Very nice people, but parents only speak German, and Anne is an equally shy person.  The problem with the parents is that they say things that I mostly understand, but merit little response, except "okay" or "ja."  Then, when I try to think of a better response, they assume I didn't understand them.  Then Anne translates. 2)The fact that there is no 1 euro bill.  Only coinage, of which I have way to much.  But coins are okay, I suppose. 3)School Day.  I just hang in the computer lab or go to the cafeteria with the other Americans on most days, until we take our day trips.  Not a lot to do, but that's okay with the Boy. 4)Day trips.  Fun and interesting, except when we do something as a class that I just did the previous weekend with the host family.  Also, the buses are super uncomfortable for sleeping.  So there's the Evan's breakdown of Germany.  If I think of other stuff, I'll try to edit this.  Or post a comment-amendment.  Later, blogmeistern!  The Boy

      So I know peeps be mad at me for not keepin' it real with the blog. I'll try my best to keep up with it here in New York.  Okay, I'm at Camp Wakonda. It's really cool-- very beautiful, scenic. The people are all really fun and real and funny and, most importantly, like me. It's been really bizarre though. It's just the counselors right now. Kinda an orientation type thing, so I feel like I'm a camper myself. We play crazy camp games and sports, sing camp songs, have crazy hair days and all this stuff to learn what to do with the campers. I feel like I'm 8 again. It's cool. BUt I'm also planning lessons and such too.  The people are amazing. I've known them for just three days but I already feel like I've known them for a while. The English and Scottish guys are so cool and funny too. There's just an abundance of accents--those and Polish, Russian, American Southern, Bronx, and Brazilian to name a few.   Thus far everyone thinks I'm really funny, which actually sucks. Now I have to keep it up. Makes you feel like you have to keep being funny so you start trying to be funny and I don't want to cuz I never did in the first place. I think these folks just want to laugh though. Good crowd.  Well, the kids come a week from tomorrow and then the real test begins.    Oh, and one last thing. I ripped my pants tonight. HUGE rip. Sucks. I think that's why folks think I'm funny. I'm always embarassing myself. Oh well, I'm glad to make folks happy. I'm just pissed I ruined a pair of pants.

      Hello fambly, or one half of it anyway,   I'm back from the abroadness in Austria and Bavaria.  I'm just going to address the various comments of previous posts here, instead of one by one in the comments thingy.  Rather than tying each to a tree and hitting them in the head with a shovel like the dogs they are, I will simply open fire with an automatic weapon, Charles Bronson-style.  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahaha...haha...hehheh...hoo.     Okay, after a beat of sheepishness, here's the latest from Germany.  I know that all of you are probably wondering this so I'll get it out of the way first.  I can't say I've been doing a lot of drinking, especially compared to the other various Amis here, but I have tried a few beers, and I've come to this inescapable conclusion:  The Boy cannot appreciate beer.  I tried a really dark beer, which tasty gross, a mid-level beer at a club, which was slightly better but still gross, and a weiss-beer, which had a hint of banana in it, so it was easily the best brew I've had, but still not pleasing to the taste buds.  Sorry everyone, I know I'm a disappointment to the fam, but beer just doesn't taste good.  I wish it did, but nope.  No good.  The cocktails Anne makes are not bad, though.  She passed her driver's test while I was away, so she made us lime drinks that tasted like they had more alcohol than lime, but still tasty.  Also, Smirnoff tastes a'ight as well.  Haven't been clubbing it up a whole lot, just one place in Rüsselsheim, but we might do a bit more later, this weekend or next.  Unfortunately, discos hold little interest for me because I don't like to drink, certainly not enough to get drunk(mostly because I don't trust the people I'm with.  Also, it's to prove a point to a few people who kept on talking about how they would get me plastered before we came back) and therefore, dancing would be out because it would take an alternate state of mind to get me to dance.  It's sweltering in these clubs as it is.   Also, Moe, I plan on eating none of my words because I actually completely predicted how things would go.  There has been mopst certainly much awkwardness, mostly because this whole family doesn't talk a lot, and Anne's parents only speak German which limits conversation matter by a little.  Today I found myself in a losing struggle to describe what Dad does.  Also, I've found myself exceedingly annoyed with most of the other Americans on the exchange, because they only concern themselves with going to clubs and getting hammered, especially when we were abroad in Austria and whatnot.  A few even went into a strip club.  However, there have most certainly been fun moments as well, which I also conceded.  Neuschwanstein was cool, the Eagle's Nest was cool, walking around Oberammergau, which is the German equivalent of the Shire, was nifty.  However, all my fears came true.  So there.   Time to go eat now, so I'll be signing off.  This got ridiculously long.  Later, fellow Amis!  The Boy

      As I'm currently too burned out to write cohesive sentences, I've made a list of things that can be screwed according to me.  In no particular order, screw the following:  1. The bastard that hit and ran after putting a dent in the front driver's side of my car 2. Netflix for being greedy and jacking up their prices 3. Adelphia Cable for making remotes that break too easily when you throw them across the room as hard as you can 4. Flanders 5. The Lakers (actually this one supercedes all the rest by far) 6. The Yankees (except this one which supercedes the above plus all the rest) 7. This stupid cut on my hand that started stinging real bad after it came into contact with caustic cleaning chemicals 8. The above use of alliteration 9. Dubya 10. This one girl that almost had a head on collision with me in the Ralph's parking lot yesterday  Yes, LA can be an extremely fun place to live sometimes.  Luckily, there's always option 2...

      Hi fellow bloggarts.  So I am learning what it's like to do hard manual labor again. I can deal with walking a lot, staying on my feet, carting stuff around, or even doing menial tasks such as shoveling dirt from one end of the concentration camp to the other and then going vice versa. But dammit I hate tiling floors. There is so much bending of the knees for extended hours that I can't get comfortable. Oh sure, you could try squating, or just standing and bending all the way over. But any and all options grow ever so uncomfortable after 9 hours. But of course, there is the option of two....hmm..  Luckily Mr. Raney is a good boss. It's sorta like going to war if your captain was a man's man with the men. OK. That could be phrased better. But since Mr. Raney is a guy I respect and find funny, it's easier to work some bad jobs for him over, say, that Nazi testicle who almost fired me last summer for hitting a girl in the head with a rock. Who, just for the record, wasn't winning any beauty contests anyway, so the scar at least added some character.   Since my brain has just told my conscience that I've written something showing poor moral fiber, my conscience has decided to cause me to feel a dull ache in my stomache. Guilt, I think it is. Owww... Luckily, I know how to remedy it. No, Ki, it's not for the man who did the waking to buy a drink for the man who does the listening of the proposition. I will, hereby vow, to pick up any sad looking sot who is walking in a downpour without any rain gear next time I see one. I say this because I was such a sot just today after Mr. Raney dropped me off at my car at the end of the day and I realized I left my keys in his truck. So I hoofed it a little over two miles in a downpour.  So yes. I don't care if the guy knifes me, I'm offering him (or her) a ride home. .....Unless they're ugly.  (kidding).  Ciao for now. ~Moe Money

      As many of you should know, I'm in Germany now.  You should all have gotten an email.  Anywho, not a lot to report right now.  I do have one bit of breaking news, however:  Icelandic people talk funny.  I flew on an Icelandic airline, so the captain had to do his whole spiel in both English and Icelandic.  It sounds really funny, let me tell you.     So yeah, these keyboards are tough to use.  I'm going to type a line as my fingers would normally move on an American keyboard.  Just joking.  I tried a second ago, and this website said, "no deal."  Suffice it to say, this is tough.  Right Ki?  See, I had to stop and peer at the keyboard a second ago just to find the question mark.  So this is, needless to say, a time-consuming ordeal.  And, seeing as I've given you all an update via email, I'll break this off now.  Would you other people get off your rumps and post?  Sheesh.

      All right, I guess I will post my summer plans, where they will be free of interruption.  Tomorrow's the last day of school.  Then I go to Germany on Monday.  And I don't mind saying, I'm not entirely looking forward to it.  I'm sure there will be fun moments, and being on another continent will be all well and good, to be sure.  The only problem is the egregious amounts of people that I will be forced to deal with, of which some will be unable to speak English.  See, I guess I'm the only person who really has this problem, but I find awkwardness to be tangible.  When I'm sitting with some people that I don't know, trying to utilize my underdeveloped-at-best conversation skills, the awkwardness of the conversation/imminent long pauses while I try to think of something to say, squeeze my like a vise and cause me to unconsciously grit my teeth or inhale deeply.  And I know that there will be moments aplenty like that in the "beloffed fazzerland," only they'll also be in German.  I will be suffocated by the severe weirdness of the situation until I pass out.  The times when I'm around the other various Americans (well, some of them anyway) should be relatively okay.   Then I go back to work at M and T.  I should be getting a buck an hour raise, so that'll all be la-dee-da.  The college search will also begin.  I'll probably visit some Iowa colleges and maybe a few in Minnesota or other parts o' Wisconsin.  Sorry Ki, I like the midwest just fine, and it'll serve my college purposes equally fine-like.   Also, to post a movie review very well might kill me.  See, I tried to a while back, when suddenly I collapsed on the computer.  I woke up three days later in the hospital where I was informed that I had suffered an inexplicable combination heart and brain failure.  I was a little freaked.  Imagine what would have happened if I had had time to hit the "Publish Post" button.   Okay fine, I'll post some reviews.  By the way, I will give $1 to whoever can identify where the hell the title of this post comes from.

      RISING! Fading. Fading....gone. OK. So now I can type.  Sorry I haven't been an active participant lately, fellow bloggers. I blame the lack of participation. But I also blame the fact that my computer has been, much to its chagrin and despite its ignored pleading of "no dis-assemble! Nooo dis-assemble!" taken apart since last Friday. But now I have Mom and Dad's to use, so equilibrium between the siblings can be achieved. There. .... .... ... .... ...Ahhhh.....homeostasis...mmmmm.  Well! The summer looks to be chalk full of doing lots of stuff. I have several goals, all big. Mostly: become financially independant AND stable-ish, and get my portfolio and do more illustration work so I'm 100% effective in my field and ready for good and possibly hard job. This is all to serve the LARGER goal of me going to San Diego so I can surf and SCUBA dive and hang with West Coast sibs, which serves the EVEN LARGER ULTIMATE goal of keeping it exceedingly real. My work is cut out to me, but with the help of garden gnomes, which I have classified as G.U.L.D. (G.nomes U.ltimately L.ead to D.ecisive victory), it should be no problem. Also I am making an effort to appease the Gods under whose rule I am governed under. By which I mean I try to help out Mom a lot so I stay on her good and un-nagged side.   So. The Ki goes to the Big Apple, The Boy goes deep behind enemy lines (Nazi Germany) before looking for a place to party till he's naked (a.k.a. checking out colleges) and I struggle to invest in put off happiness. What, then I ask, is Jay's plan for the summer? Huh? How now?  So yeah. Do you have any ambitious goings ons? How's the script coming?  As for doing coding for a website, afraid I can't. I don't know how. That's more a programers domain. I could whip up a dandy flash animation, but I can't html code. But maybe towards the end of the summer I could make a flash website which would be equally cool. I'll look into it.  End of transmission.

      Okay, so the blog has been quiet as of late.  And don't think I don't know what's going on here.  With Mo and Ki back in EC, I'm the only one not currently under the roof of the 109.  And with a mini-reunion of sorts going on, who needs to blog?  Right then.  But before I decide to seek consolation in the bottle (henceforth referred to as "option 2"), I'm going to make an effort to get some kind of sound off going here, in a desperate attempt at inclusion.  In short, here's what the hell I'd like to know:  Ki: When do you quit your job, and what is your glorious exit plan? (e.g. steal motorized cart, kidnap boss and play his/her head like a bongo on your way out)  When do you take off for New York, and again, what is your glorious exit plan (e.g. steal motorized cart, kidnap Dad, and play his head like a bongo on your way out)  And finally, am I still supposed to be taping the Shield for your cable deprived self.  (I have been so far)  The Boy: When is school out, where are you working this summer, and when are you leaving for Deutschland. (sp?)  Also, would it kill you to post a film review on here once in a while?  Two words.  Cut.  Paste.  Mo: Basically, anything.  I haven't heard much since you dropped off the map for about a month, I know you sold most of your wordly possessions and uprooted yourself from Duluth, and I also know that you belittled a student in Mom's class that had it coming.  Other than that, I know nothing.  You need to post, lest you become the red-headed stepchild of this here blog.  Okay then.  Back to work I go, thanks to which, by the way, I will be going home with a handle of José Cuervo tonight, I kid you not.  Option 2 is just around the corner...

      I DID IT!  Yesterday at lunch, and it was everything I hoped it could be.  Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever made.    First, the bread was toasted.  Then buttered, then nuked so the butter would melt and sink in.  Oh but it continues.  Hormel bacon.  Four strips.  evenly distributed amongst a tender handful of thin sliced delicatessen pastrami.  Topped with a a slice of American cheese.  Then nuked one last time to melt the cheese just a little and to make the whole thing warm and toasty.    Then I took a bite.    Holy Lord.    You know, I usually rush through my meals, 'cuz life's too short to waste time eating, much less cooking/preparing.  This sandwich though made me see the error in my ways.  Food can really be a fulfilling life experience if done right.  I was happier in that moment after taking a bite than I'd been all week, which is saying a lot since I was pretty darn happy after mopping the floor with my friend Mark at Madden 2004 two nights earlier.  But anyway, there's something to said for taking the time to put a little TLC into the preparation of one's meal.  I have seen the future, people, and it is good.  So I give pastrami and bacon my highest recommendation, and I envy anyone about to have the experience for the first time.  However, that isn't to say I still won't find myself eating soup out of can tonight when I get home from work, in an effort to maximize this evening's leisure time...

      This next story happened two days after my previous story I posted.   3:30 a.m.--Alarm clock goes off and I stumble out of bed. I slept in my clothes so I just put in my contacts, wake up Jessica, eat breakfast and get in the car.  4:00 a.m.--Took off in wrong direction due to sleepiness. After 5 minutes, I realize my mistake, slap myself awake and turn around.  4:15 a.m.--Driving down interstate. It pouring and even with the wipers going full-power, I can barely see. And the only other people about are semi-drivers.  I don't feel safe.  4:30 a.m.--I feel even less safe when the driver-side wiper decides it doesn't want to work anymore. I can see absolutely nothing and pull over. I try to fix it, but nothing. I also decide I shouldn't alert everyone on the highway that there are two young women stranded here. I start to panick cuz I have to get to Madison by 7:15 so Jessica can make her bus. I call the parents and a police car pulls over behind us. He tells me to go slow and get off at the next exit. I drive about 35 mph down the interstate for about 10 minutes with the cop tailing us so no one rear ends us. We're now in Osseo and follow him to an all-night garage. There a man looks at the car, has me pop the trunk, fiddles w/ something for a second, and the problem is solved. I don't know what happened, but we give him some cash, and take off.  5:00 a.m.--On the road again, but now worried that Jessica will miss her bus causing her to miss her plane and screwing everything up. I have about 145 miles to go, and a little over 2 hours to do it. "I feel the need, the need for speed."  5:15 a.m.--My need for speed is not as great as my need to stay alive. After some scary hydro-planing activity, I discover that I can only go 55 mph w/o crashing into a ditch. I feel like I'm having a heart-attack.  5:25 a.m.--Roads aren't rivers anymore (though it's still raining pretty hard) so I give it some more gas.  6:00 a.m.--Rain finally starts to die down. Luckily, I haven't come across a police car cuz I'm doing around 82 mph.  6:15 a.m.--Jessica and I almost cry after a swallow crashes into the wind shield. Feel like murderous crap as traffic increases.  7:06 a.m.--We pull into the parking lot of the bus stop. Whoa. We did it. But not lawfully.   7:15 a.m.--I hug Jessica good-bye. She gets on bus and I go to the bathroom at a gas station, put in Simon and Garfunkel and sing my heart out all the way so to keep myself awake. I notice three cop cars on the way home looking for speeders. I feel sneaky.  So finally, that was my driving adventure.

      It's been a good long time since I blogged, and I'm feeling bloggish.  So here I go.  Ahem.  Bloggity blog-blog bloggo blog.  Bloggity bloggity blogitty bloggin blogger blog.  Blog blog.   That was great.  I really had to get that out of my system.   So anywho, I've decided to make a post about the people I work with, because they're just so derned inneresting.  Moe's gotten the low-down on most of this already, but I'm sure you other city people are curious about the inner workings of a blue collar hillbilly company. The most interesting person is probably Mike Trubshaw.  Most people call him Mikey or Little Mike because there are a lot of people at M&T Sprinklers who are named Mike.  The interesting thing about Mike is that, when I think about how to describe him, the first trait that jumps readily to mind is that he loves to drink.  I mean, LOVES to drink.  He's currently working through some court business for his 3rd DUI.  He can no longer drink legally, but that doesn't stop him, and is currently up to a $1000 signature bond.  Also, his divorce is final tomorrow, so he, in the tradition of all people when they finally slice the knot, is throwing a beer bash at the VFW tomorrow night to celebrate his divorce.  All this comes to mind before even what he looks like, and he is easy to pick out because he's about 5'4" and always wears black socks to work, so he looks pretty goofy.  He routinely comes to work hung over and can't remember what all he did the night before.  He's the son of the owner of M&T, but was still in danger of being fired because his drinking is so gratuitous that Luke has had to drive Mikey around on service calls because Mike hasn't had a license for quite some time now.   Justin Ellis is the other most fun person to work with.  He's a foreman, been with the company for 5 years now.  He's also not a real big guy, but he still looks tough.  He's the most tattooed person I know, with all the usual tough guy tattoos, including barbed wire lacing his forearms, and then some skull tattoos and a big dragon head covering a bicep from shoulder to elbow.  He's the most likely to scope out women while working and then make uncouth comments.  (His grossest that I've heard him say, and he's said a lot of gross stuff, is, "if they're old enough to bleed, they're old enough to breed.")  This guy is also married and has 2 young daughters.  But he's the easiest to work with, because he's always cracking jokes and doesn't take the job too seriously.  He's also had to regularly carry little Mike out of bars because Mike is drunk beyond the capacity for movement. So there's a taste for the Wisconsin working class.  Fun guys all, and definitely motivation for better education.  Later, bloglings!  The Boy

      I was just sitting here at work, minding my own, when the most random thing popped into my head, so random that I immediately said it out loud:  "What about the Twonky?"  And in that moment I began laughing, not unlike someone who has suddenly gone utterly and completely mad.  And I thought, you know, what ABOUT the Twonky?  Whatever happened to the Twonky?  And furthermore, what would the TWONKY do?    I have no answers to any of these questions, but I felt the questions needed to be posed to, in fact, no one.  So the next time you find yourself really bored, or just want to confuse the hell out of whoever's sitting next to you, ask aloud about the Twonky.  You'll be glad you did.  P.S. - click on the title of this post to discover the origin of the Twonky.

      Okay, time to get back into the swing of things here.  I now have two things that I didn't have since last I blogged.  A coffee maker, and a Tivo.  Used in moderation, these things can bring much happiness and prosperity.  However, if their power is abused it can bring much suffering and ruination.    Let me first just say that Tivo is really cool.  I don't care what anybody says, the first time you pause live television is a real kick.  I actually felt a little drunk on power for a second.  However, what this now means is that shows that I haven't watched in forever, namely Simpsons and Seinfeld, I suddenly find myself watching all the damn time.  I was too lazy to plan my time around Simpsons reruns for example, but now I have five episodes to choose from when I get home from work.  Luckily, with Simpsons being a funny show and all, levels of happiness exponentially increase the more one is exposed to it.  Therefore, a very necessary and formerly missing part of life has now been restored.    However, one can only stay awake and watch obscene amounts of television for so long under one's own power.  That's where coffee comes in handy.  And so it was that I found myself finishing a third jumbo cup of Breakfast Blend with a couple spoonfuls of Nesquik at 2:00 in the morning a couple nights ago.  But it wasn't until about an hour and half later, as I lay in bed restlessly with a pounding headache that I thought to myself "I may have a problem."  For I would soon be going into work on very little sleep, and the only way to get more energy would be...to drink more coffee.  This was starting to dangerously sound like the coffee equivalent of alcoholism.    As is often the case with me, overcompensation seemed to be the solution.  I decided to not drink any coffee for a while, which sucks, but as of this writing I still haven't.  Furthermore, I decided that in the interest of good health, my lunch that day would consist of me sitting down with a plate of vegetables.  Even as I write that, I can't believe I actually did it.  And yet there I was, a glorious spread of carrots, broccoli, celery and cherry tomatoes before me, and nothing else.  I tried to make the best of it by imagining myself as a plant eating dinosaur, and that this would be a tasty little treat for a brontosaur such as me.  Thankfully I had snapped out of it by the time I got home and cooked up a gluttonous helping of chili mac.  Tonight I watched Treehouse of Horror XIII.  Solid.  Favorite quote of the episode - Mayor Quimby speaking to the crowd after Springfield has surrendered and melted down all their guns - "I now declare our town - utterly defenseless!"

      OK. Today I've decided to devise a list of things I'd like to paint a picture of that will probably never sell in the town of Eau Claire.  1. John Menard and the white haired maniacal grinning guy being gutted with their own garden implements by penguins. 2. Brett Favre shooting up with drugs. 3. Brett Favre holding hands with another guy. 4. Dinosaurs ordering drinks on Waterstreet. 5. A worm holding a sign next to the Minnesota state line sign holding up a sign that says "Wisconsin tastes like rotten fecal matter" 6. Chewbacca line dancing with ewoks  OK. that's enough listing. So it's come to my attention that Spider Man 2 is excellent. This could be for many reasons. It could be because of the well placed and wholly appropriate Bruce Campbell cameo. Or perhaps it's because of the rockin'-ness. But whatever the case, I encourage this movie to be seen. But I must issue a side note of warning. The beginning of the movie (witnessed with Mother, Dad, and the Boy) had a commercial that showed a woman slipping out of her clothes and negligee while passionately kissing some shirtless dude. As the heavily shadowed duo tremously made their way up stairs and closed the door, it was pretty obvious they were going to ... fix the cable?  Or maybe sex each other. What, you may ask, was the ad for? That's right. Toothpaste. Dammit I could just shit.  OK. More bloggin later. No wait. More blogging now. Do you realize that if Floggin Molly had a blog site it could be called Bloggin Floggin Molly? Yeahhhh   Moe Out.
