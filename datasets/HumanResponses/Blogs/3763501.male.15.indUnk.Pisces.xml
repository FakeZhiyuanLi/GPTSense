      So now my dad is officially telling people I am working on a car. It has sat in our backyard for 3 years. So I pulled out the seat and vacumed. Very fun. And then while I was pulling out the rear seat, the bolt came off and I skinned my chin on the back of the seat. I got the seat out, eventually, and have a nice strawberry to show for it. Well since i have nothing more to say, Arrivederci!

      My mom was wondering why my eyes were all bloodshot. Go figure. I stayed up till 6:30 in the morning on Photoshop at a friends house. Fun. And then I find his sister's friend is over. She is quite annoying. And then we played more video games and football. People still think the football at a LAN party is ironic. Oh well.  Arrivederci

      Well lets see, I am at a LAN party, and we played lots of video games. Of course, thats what you do at a lan party. But then we played football which one of my friends was so totally ironic since we played football at a lan party. Oh well, I am going to Spiderman 2 on wednesday and I dont have a ride yet. I might hopefully get one from Katie. Then we are going to han gout at Katie's house when we are done. Then Maybe Heather would go to youth group with me and get to see al my friends. Which might not be such a good thing. Since there is nothing else to say I'm going end this blog with a joke.    Top 10 Funny Store Signs    1.Outside a muffler shop: "No appointment necessary, we hear you coming."  2.Outside a hotel: "Help! We need inn-experienced people."  3.On a desk in a reception room: "We shoot every 3rd salesman , and the 2nd one just left."  4.In a veterinarians waiting room: "Be back in 5 minutes, Sit ! Stay!"  5.At the electric company: "We would be de-lighted if you send in your bill. However, if you don't you will be."  6.On the door of a computer store: "Out for a quick byte."  7.In a restaurant window: "Don't stand there and be hungry, come on in and get fed up."  8.Inside a bowling alley: "Please be quiet, we need to hear a pin drop."  9.In the front yard of a funeral home: "Drive carefully, we'll wait."  10.In a counselors office: "Growing old is mandatory, growing wise is optional.

      My mom signed me up for this psat class that is supposed to increase your score like a 100 points, so i honestly didnt want to go. And then guy teacher guy dude said that we were smart in taking this class or out parents were hoping to pay for less of our college. And i laughed. Laugh.  Anyway, youth group was fun, we played elbow tag, and i couldnt catch micheal. That boy can really run fast, and he didnt tag anyone because we liked watching me run like a dork, fo figure. And then the last youth group, Jill got me snuggles dryer sheets. They are soo cool i put them in my window and changed my icon to snuggles. It rox sox. Thanks Jill.  And then after one of my psat classes, since it was in portland, i dragged my mom to compusa and taco bell and i gots a new network hub 5-port combo uplink 100mbps, HA!&nbsp;not like i needed it or anything.&nbsp; But it looks cool connecting my two comps in its shiny silvery fashion. O yeah, and i got a few comp parts. And i built an entire new pc, now i have two, which is two more than you!! And its cool, cuz my site is on one of them, which you can find at  urlLink http://www.force.co.nr   im done talking  au revoir

      Well, lets see. Its 4:45 A.M. Im really tired. I have nothing better to do. Everyone except me and another kid are asleep. The other kid is playing a single player game. I got a new system and have no use for it right now. I got new fans for my case so now its blue and silver in stead of rainbow with silver plus blue bubble bars.&nbsp; It looks really good now. I actually have a good computer now. I've had 3 cokes. DANG thats annoying. Hey guys hows it going. (and gals) today was pretty good, worked for 6 hourin 300 degree weather and all but had a heat stroke. Then i came to the lan party. Bought parts for my new system. Got it going and it looks really cool right now. And then the kid gave me a free version of windows xp pro, and you dont have to register it or anything, its so cool. So yeah, it supposedly cost about 150$ legally. This week has been good but nothing can compare to monday. You'll have to read my other blog entries to find out what happened then. So i guess i'll be talking to yall later.  Au revoir

      Lets see, today I mowed my grandma's lawn. Then I went to the store and got a 50-pack of cd-rs, new headphones, cd wallet, and 16 brand new batteries. I can safely assume im prepared. And I still have to get a few books. Then I checked the ip tracker for this blog and found someone I didn't know, who lives anywhere within the area 30 miles within Portland or Vancouver. Dude! Your ip is 65.122.144.29. Ok, now im losing it. Arrivederci!

      A few of us went to see Spiderman 2. It was an ok movie. Better than the first if I do say so myself. Then Heather, Katie, Nick and I went to Quiznos afterwords. I still don't understand the whole napkin thing. Oh well. Then they went to my youth group. I kind of felt bad because I left them alone a few times to switch something in the sound booth. Sorry Heather. Well I hope they had a good time. Although Nick kinda looked bored without Katie. I'm just not sure. O well. Voy a escribir depues.
