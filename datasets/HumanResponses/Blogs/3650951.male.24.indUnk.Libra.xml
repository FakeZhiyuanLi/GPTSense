       Melvin has been bothering most of the people in the Lean Shift with this song for 4 days in a row now.... so in an effort to rid myself of this  Last Song Syndrome , I have exerted an effort to create this post and hopefully pass the Last Song Syndrome to you, dear reader. Anyway, I don't mind because I happen to like this song. In fact, I'm learning it in guitar so that I'd be able to sing it to my dear Khrisna.  So without further ado, here it is.... This song is by Hoobstank, entitled, The Reason.   i'm not a perfect person. there are many things i wish i didnt do but i continue learning. i never meant to do those things to you. and so i have to say before i go, that i just want you to know  i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be a reason to start over new, and the reason is you  i'm sorry that i hurt you, its something i must live with everyday and all the pain i put you through, i wish that i could take it all away and be the one who catches all your tears, thats why i need you to hear  i'm not a perfect person, i never meant to do those things to you and so i have to say before i go that i just want you to know   i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be a reason to start over new, and the reason is you i've found a reason to show a side of me you didnt know a reason for all that i do, and the reason is you

       I just got off the phone with an old Mexican guy. Apparently, he was having problems with connecting to the internet. He says that Safari Cannot Find the Server.... big deal!  Big deal? Not to me it isn't! But to dumb people with an attitude, it is. I dunno, but I have talked to several old people but they seem to get along with computers fine.   FLASHBACK: Greg Clark: "Computers are rational, humans are not."  In my opinion, stupid people should not go anywhere near computers, nor be allowed to own one. Owning a Macintosh is not a fad, but a necessity. There are more people out there who cannot afford it but definitely need it. Having money doesn't give you the privilege to own a computer. Being patient enough to learn it would entitle you to own one.  A language problem is definitely workable, but a brain problem is not. A warning dung-brained people:  DO NOT BUY OR ATTEMPT TO PLAY WITH THE COMPUTER AS IT MIGHT STRAIN YOUR BRAIN.  You wouldn't want your kind to go extinct, would you?   On second thought, go ahead, attempt to play with your computer. Hopefully, you'd die of frustration with it. That way, you wouldn't be calling Tech Support complaining that it's not working when in fact, your  stupidity  is what is hindering you to go online and play stupid flash games.  EAT MY SHORTS!

       I remember when I was just starting out to discover my eye-hand coordination with the Sony Playstation. I used to either miss class or be late for class (that was back in college). I could never have enough time for myself and my video games. There were times when I considered sleeping a waste time. True. You could never fit in 4 cd's of Final Fantasy within 10-15 hours. Sure you'll get that far but you won't enjoy the game.... and how about the best driving simulator in videogame land? How are you going to get 100% game completion with Gran Turismo? Hmmmm.... Sometimes, sleeping becomes a bad thing. I've even considered it a bad habit.  Look what I am now. Not sleeping enough again because of my gurl's new game console. Yep, I am considering myself a bonafide, die-hard V.G.F. (short for Video Game Freak). If only I was still in college. I'd voluntarily drop out from all of my subjects and spend my sleepless days and nights in front of thew TV (my mom used to complain about the high electricity bills, ha ha ha!).  I realized that I could not get my mind off of that game console. Even at work, with the T1 connection that we have, I manage to fit in some browsing for tips and tricks about the game that I'm playing.  But there is only one thing in the world that would get my mind off the video game madness (except the call of nature). The only thing that could make me swallow my pride. The only thing that could make me do crazy things that I'm not capable of doing. That thing is my love for Khrisna. If there's one thing that I am sure of, it would be my feelings for her. I dot always think about video games but I always think about Khrisna.... in everything I say and in everything I do.  I can proudly say that I am  blessed  to have this gurl in my life. I'm sorry but she's not your regular good-looking-fuck-me-harder type of girl. She's an unconventional gurl, extremely smart and pretty, and creative to boot.  To close this little bitching that I am doing, I would like to announce that I will be getting a  steering wheel  for the console, to make my Gran Turismo 3 and Need for Speed Underground the best  muthfuckingshitangbilishanepanggandaiwishihadthiscar  experience with this game console. Long live Sony!

       John Lopez had a following back in 1984. Back when hair dye was popular, mini skirts were in, punk was not dead, and of course, Marijuana was the craze. Normal muggles would describe John Lopez as one of the most popular, good-natured-kid-gone-bad because of peer pressure and the need to belong. But before he became a rotten tomato, he was a straight catholic. A religious teenager who would hear mass every single day, conscious of breaking the Lord's word.   He was a bright kid, never late for class. In fact, we was a straight-A student. Muggles say that John was influenced by a guy called Lazarus. Quite ironic, being that Lazarus was the man Jesus brought from the dead.   We could say that Lazarus "brought out" John Lopez' dark side, and was successful at it. Muggles could not figure out why, or how, John Lopez became friends with Lazarus. Some say that John lopez was really a rotten tomato, a plague waiting to be released. Some say that he was forced to do it for some obscure reason but whatever that unknown reason was, John Lopez was already marked by society.   He started from a well-known goody-good guy to well-known baddy-bad guy. He once had the hearts of the good guys and the hatred of the bad guys. Now, it's the other way around. Whether good or bad, John Lopez still had a following back in 1984.

       With virtually nothing to do during our shift, our small group, burns the clock away by talking about things around us, the latest office gossip, planned outings or gimmicks, past gimmicks / outings or we keep it simple by just singing our time away.  We have covered almost all popular songs, from the early 80's up to the current hits. Bob Dylan would definitely grin at our version of a few of his songs. Madonna would be flaterred at how we destroyed Like A Virgin. The Black Eyed Peas would kill themselves over our version of Where Is The Love, and Queen lead singer, Freddie Mercury would turn and puke in his grave and kill himself over our version of the Bohemian Rhapsody.  Anyway, who cares? Nobody! we just sing our hearts away in conjunction to our next videoke night out. Practice makes perfect they say....

       Welcome to my new blog....  The internet is getting more and more taxing.  urlLink Internet pages  just seem to  urlLink popup  on the screen over what you are doing. I guess there really are people who profit from annoying other people. I am lucky to be working in Technical Support because I know what exactly happens and how to resolve it.  I now have the ultimate game station at home. Pretty soon, I will be uploading some pictures that we took with it. No longer will I be called a "half-way-gamer" for I now have the power of the  urlLink Playstation 2 .   urlLink Congratulations to me .

       started maxing out Yuna, Auron, and Wakka's stats last night. damn that was a lot of work, i had to bribe and fight and bribe and fight then customize armor, then fight a ridiculously hard enemy that drops the weapon i need, then fight and die, and fight and die and so forth. the reward:     Yuna, Auron, and Wakka's S.Level = 99.    how cool is that.?  fuck.   now that S.Levels are now easy to get, i'm running out of power, ability, mana, and speed spheres. ack. fortunately i know someone who knows how to ger it, and i am sending him a text message right this minute.   muahahaha!

       i've finally obtained these two aeons. kinda hard considering the requirements needed to unlock these two powerful characters. delta force and oblivion overdrive fucking rocks. i can't wait to uberize Yuna and see how much freaking damage Anima makes on an enemy. so far, Valeflor, Bahamut and Shiva are&nbsp;the only aeons that exceed maximum damage. but all in all, i think im too far away from successfully obliterating the dark Aeons. this game's fucking addictive. an expected motivation from Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series.

       i'm down to the last leg of the Final Fantasy X series. it sure is a good game. actually i should've been finished with it a week ago. i just want to obtain all the Celestial Weapons plus all the nice stuff that come with it. problem is, its sooper hard to get it. lots of rare items that only ultra hard enemies drop. plus you have to overkill them (meaning 2 times the normal damage that would kill them). in order to do that, your characters  MUST  be  uberized.  ultra strong, with stats maxed out. shit. on top of that, i'm having problems defeating the dark aeons that guard certain places where imporatnt items are. it gets frustrating but i'm trying to get on top of it.  as usual, i'm not getting enough sleep. anyway, i've no regrets.  this game's a bitch to play, but if you beat it, your one motherfucking gamer, worth to be called a Final Fantasy extremist. that is my goal.

       So today's another boring day at work. Nothing to do except spending hours browsing the web and shit. In chat, Mark (undead freak) showed me a picture of his girlfriend in a straightjacket. It was way kewl! I wanted to steal the photo and post it here but I'm a respectful kid and I wasn't brought up that way. Just look for them  gothic  people in  urlLink myspace . Then, check out their friends and their friends' friends. You know the drill. &nbsp; It's funny how a lot of people are so excited about the web. I dunno but I seem to get bored over it. Maybe because I've been working with the Internet for almost three years now that I just grew tired of it. I mean, I know the Internet is a  big   place, and you will never, ever have the chance to go to   all   the websites out there. If you manage to, drop me an email, imma send you some cash. LoL.  &nbsp; I've got three more hours before I go home and hopefully finish Final Fantasy X. It's going to be tough, I know, but this may be the best game of all the FF series. I can't say for sure until I finish the game. After that, I'm back to Mr. Clancy to finish Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow. I put him on hold because of  urlLink Jay Rex's  blabbing about FF X being the best there is.

       Okay, so I don't have any relevant information or opinion on beheading freaks and other current events....   What I do know is that I found this bad-assed email account wherein they offer a  urlLink free 1 Gigabyte webased email account . beat that!   I still love Khrisna though and she still loves me. We're turning 1 year on the 27th of this month.   What else?   I'm going home in a few. My off is fast approaching and I'm determined to finish  Final Fantasy X  in 2 weeks. wish me luck.

       I have learned countless times in the past the the simplest things always work. I've been working in the computer industry for quite a while now and normally, powercycling the modem, computer, or whatever electronic-state-of-the-art device you have solves the problem.  Sometimes, the devices instantly turns to crap. You can't blame it. Machines also grow old and outdated, just like other stuff so don't expect your Macintosh desktop computer, running os 7 to continue to work and be compatible with the latest software, or your Windows 95/98 to run at maximum speed and performance without getting the  urlLink Blue Screen of Death .  I've just spoken to an Engineer (or so he says). He had a connection problem. His DSL sync was intermittent. He mentioned that he had his inside wiring re-wired, called the phone service provider, called Apple, but still had the same problem. Finally, he decided to call his ISP (I work there). Okay so he goes blabbing about his extensive Engineering, Communications, and computer experience for the good 20 minutes of time (thank you very much). Obviously, I was able to endure those agonizing 20 minutes because I was doing something else. Anyway, when I had a chance to butt-in, I simply asked how his computer and modem was setup. Turned out that our Engineer had his DSL modem hooked up to a Surge Protector (Jeez!!! I thought you were a super engineer!) which was definitely what was causing his problem. So he spent the next ten minutes making a fool of himself, wondering why he never thought of that angle because after the surge protector was disconnected his connection stabilized.  Sir, you have too much on your mind. 30 minutes of your time maybe nothing to you, but 30 minutes of my time is very important. I don't know how to explain it to you, go figure!   Best to be humble, set aside your knowledge and keep things simple. Learn your lesson.

       I'm currently addicted to Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow.  Five stars to this great game!!!  It mimicks most of modern day arms and weapons, save for 2-4 guns in the arsenal. The moves are great, graphics are fine, sound is good, strategy - the best. All in all, this is not a game for dumb people (the kind who go and watch Kamasutra waiting for the sex cut, going out the moviehouse saying it sucked because they didn't get to see any pussy).  *sigh*  I finally got my Final Fantasy X International version to display english text instead of Japanese. Funny thing is, Iit's the only game I fell asleep with while playing. Is it boring me? Maybe because I got to play the first part of the game already in someone's game console. Anyway, I'm proud of my achivement. It didn't take me as long as the Nile river to crack it and traslate it to English to convert the language. I just hope that when I load the game back after work, it defaults to English and not Jap-o. Anyway, its not logical for it to revert to default settings since i saved the game several times to make sure. Machines, computers, eletronic stuff are rational....  humans  however are not.

       When answering an exam, please be sure to read and understand that instructions as well as the questions. I think this one is an exception:    The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term:   "Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."   Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:   First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities.  1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.   So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year "That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.   The student got the only A.

       Just finished Onimusha 3....  Damn that was a good game. my GTA 3 - Vice City is not working fine at all. Error reading GTA 3 - Vice City DVD. Damn, so is my Codebreaker v.7! I think I'm gonna start playing Resident Evil: Code Veronica tonight.   I've lost weight due to obssesive playing, but hey, I think it's worth it. Anyway, It's my way of getting rid of stress, plus I find it quite hard to go to bed without Khrisna beside me. I just wish that she finds someone willing to trade shifts with her so that we'd have same shifts.

       This game has superior graphics, challenging controls, great storyline. Gamers certainly have developed a bond with the Onimusha Trilogy.   Let me give you a synopsis on the  urlLink Onimusha 3  story:   "The story starts in June 2 1582, in the Honnou-ji Temple as Mitsuhide Akechi leads a great number of war flags against Nobunaga Oda. The warring years of early Japan, wherein Samanosuke  Akechi, the warrior possesing Ogre power stands tall in preparation to lay waste to the Demon Lord, Nobunaga Oda.   Nobunaga Oda had been successfully disposed off by Jyubei Yagyu nine years earlier, but has come back stronger and more powerful than ever. He forged an alliance with the Genma, violent, demon-like creatures from Hell.  Samanosuke was successful in fighting his way towards Nobunaga Oda and was hoping to end the battle of all battles once and for all when he is eveloped with a swirl of light and then disappears.  Meanwhile in May 8, 2004, in Paris, France, swarms of deamons lay waste to the city creating rivers of blood. A French officer named Jacques Blanc frantically fends off the demons in desperation when Samanosuke appears out of nowhere and slices and dices the demons for him. After the battle, Samanosuke is still clueless as to what happened to him when he spots Guilderstern, the Genma ultimate scientist on a rooftop. Meanwhile, Jacques suffers the same fate as Samanosuke did and is slowed by a swirl of light.  Jacques wakes up 500 years before his time in Japan, 1582. As he explores the region, he catches an illusion of Henri, his son, being attacked by a Genma demon. Jacques tries to save him but he runs out of ammunition. Suddenly, Jacques right arms shines with blinding light and is shocked to find that he now wears a gauntlet, the same gauntlet on the right arm of Samanosuke, which is worn only by a selected few who are granted the power of the Ogres.  Two men, both in times and foreign countries, united in one goal: get back home and eliminate Nobunaga Oda! (source: http://www.capcom.com/oni3.html)"   Hmmm.... just an observation, some of the characters in the game are quite identical to the characters in another superb game from Koei called  urlLink Samurai Warriors . Characters like Mitsuhide Akechi, Nobunaga Oda, and Ranmaru Mori are a few to mention in the game. Further googling shows that such characters are part of Japan's rich history. So moms out there, please let your kids play video games. They actually learn a lot from them. I speak from experience.

       i discovered this site called  urlLink googlewhack . the object of the game is to run a search on google using two terms that will display only one search result. the catch: the words should exist in the  urlLink dictionary .  one irritating shit that happens is that you cannot upload your "whacked" results (if your're smart enough to find one) because the site uploader will not take it. this is because the google definition links to dictionary.com have been removed.... vanished as the  urlLink googlewhack webmaster  might say. so in turn, the upload tool used for the "whacked" results do not allow you to show the world how smart you are.  frustrating because i've got quite a few results that may be of note! ggggggggggggggggggggg! >=)

       Seen the   Dawn of the Dead   a couple of days ago. I wonder why people are still flocking to the movie houses after more than 2 weeks on the box office?   Maybe because the movie (a remake from a George Romero's  Dawn of the Dead , released last 1979) is different from other zombie movies. Sure Night of the Living Dead freaked everyone out. But the zombies there are slow-moving-mindless-slugs, just wanting to feed on human flesh. In this movie, zombies still want to gorge on our flesh. but they are no longer mindless slugs with impaired locomotor skills. They now have sensitive bodily senses, they move very fast and they have renewed strength. One bite is all it takes to infect you with their filth. Several hours later, you lose your pupils and develop a hunger for human flesh. Kewl!  This maybe one factor that gives this low-budget movie it's appeal. Although the visual effects (makeup and shit)are rather impressive, the movie lacks focus on the script and lacks emphasis on certain aspects of the story. It would've been great if there was background information on all characters.  Anyway, the blood and gore was great, especially the maggot infested food on the yacht (thanks a lot I just lost my appetite).  All in all, no movie is perfect. They all have their flaws. This one was quite good, but it will not surpass Resident Evil. Apart from starting from a video game, the story was good (not far from the game itself), the characters good, the zombies better.

       finished episode 1-10 of Taken by Steven Spielberg. started at around 8 in the morning and finished at around 10 pm. that was one hell of a long movie, but hey, that's why it's called a movie marathon.  i couldn't understand why my PS2 console showed the movie in black and white. there wasn't an option to configure it and convert it to colored. the manual shows that by default the console is in NTSC. the movie is in NTSC. why the heck was it in black and white?  i couldn't appreciate the visual effects on the series because of the specific shit.  anyway, i have maxed out Yuna, Auron and Wakka. I'm now starting to max out Tidus, Kimahri and Lulu. I still don't have any of Wakka's other overdrives (because you have to win them in Blitzball which doesn't appeal to me) and also his and Kimahri's celestial weapons. You'd need to win all of Wakka's overdrives, and finish the Butterfly Challenge for Kimahri. Also, I couldn't get Tidus' Sun Crest because Bahamut is guarding the freaking way into Yunalesca's realm. shit. it would be sometime before I would be able to get it. Tidus' weapons right now suck except for the Durandal.  i'm getting frustrated with the spheres (power, speed, magic, ability) you can't buy them anywhere. you'd have to win them from monsters. jeez. talk about BORING. anyway, i think that's enough. you go fuck yourself.
