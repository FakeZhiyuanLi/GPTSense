      Mood: Cheerful  Music: Roger Whitaker - Ding Dong Merrily on High  Yo, this is just the beginning of the blog; So... I'll talk about day 1.  I woke up, dog was barking.. I had to deal with that. When I was done with that, I watched some show... Starting Over... It's part of my "Lesson", somehow. But after that, of course I went onto the computer. Hell, I LIVE on my computer. But anyways, I went around BHZ's, and Nintendo.com forums, The new N-Advanced, and a lil' bit of KRR and MW's. But anyway, we had somewhat of a party last night, no big deal, same ol', same ol'. Nothing really went on, they left around 10. Which is weird because they were gonna' stay here instaed. Oh well, 24 year olds will be 24 year olds. So... Bye.  Forgot, here's a link to my forum. =P  http://acn.3.forumer.com

      Mood: Achey Music: Truckin' Jam (30 min) - The Grateful Dead  Yep. I'm back. Back in black as they say... I guess I majorly pissed off the people over at BHZ's, so, I'm staying away for as long as it takes... I'm staying off AIM too, so I'll be out of contact. Yesterday went fine, until I smacked my forhead on the ceiling... It still hurts. My cousins came yesterday, and we had somewhat of a party. I turned off all the lights at about 1AM and said that's what it's like inside Marylin Manson's house in braud daylight. But anyway, I pissed BHZ's off, I banged my forhead... Can this week get any worse!?

      Mood: Scared  I just had the weirdest night ever in the history of my life. I woke up on the floor of my parent's bedroom to hear someone next door yelling "FUCK IT ALL!! FUCK YOU ALL!!! FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!FUCK IT ALL!!!" and then heard several loud crashes, and some girl sobbing. The sobbing was sooo loud, my head was pounding. Then I heard more crashing and some more screams... By this I was uncontrollably shaking and about to start yelling. Mom told me to calm down, but hell, I couldn't. Dad was looking out the window and saying "It's over. Let's go back to bed." So... I went to bed, but then woke up to hear people screaming and police cars, and milkshake barking like crazy. They shined a light into my room and woke up.. Walked back into my parents room and asked them what was going on. I fell asleep on their floor.. I heard the police saying "Oh my god, look in the backyard. Look in the backyard!!" The police where kinda' shifty and were nervous, so I was nervous as well. 4:00AM, Heard pounding on the door. I didn't know what the hell was going on. I heard mom say "STOP IT!" but it must've been milkshake growling... i'm still freaked out about this.

It was a blast!!! We went to a big walk-in street shop, and I took some fucking SWEET pictures! I uploaded some to Spymac, got some good ratings.. I guess... I took some pictures of Denver, when we were driving to the airport. It was a really short flight, I guess it pays off having rich relitives. ^.^  So, I had lunch, walked around 'till about 6 MDT, and got back on the plane to Denver, got back here around 8. But anyway, this was a pimpin' day, and I still have eight more comin' up. ^_^
