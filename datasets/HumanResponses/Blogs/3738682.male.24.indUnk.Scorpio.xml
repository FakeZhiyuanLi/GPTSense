        i ate too much yesterday, it was one of those days where i knew that i had eaten too much so i said fuck it and ate again later. It also didnt help that i was eating high fat shit like nachos and cookies (chocolate chip with milk). not that im entirely out of shape or anything, its just that when i overeat i feel down about myself and my lack of control. its a symptom of a greater problem, my recurring inability to deny instant gratification. Its the reason i drink so much when i do drink. I cant imagine saying no to a beer. everything gets better for that short period. I just feel better. Thank the maker that i keep this gratification problem under control and am not a couch ridden obese alcoholic. It just so happens that I do the other things with just as much enthusiasm, things such as working out and going periods without eating. None of these habits are planned, they just work out that way. Im not like this every day of the week either, it just happens once or twice a week.  wow, this is some boring shit, more like a diary than anything anyone might be interested in.

        that sums up the situation. what i should do vs. what im going to do. how come sometimes i know the result of my behavior but still choose to follow thru with it? If i get up and do nothing, then im going to feel down and unaccomplished. If i get up and jog the dog, work on the house and then read some ill feel better. somedays I just slop thru the unattractive schedule and then wonder later why im eating a plate of nachos at two oclock in the morning instead of going to bed. Then theres the inevitable dilemma, when awakening in the morning, do i kill time masterbating to online porn for an hour or two or do I get out of the house as soon as possible. i know the correct answer, but im not so sure if I know how to follow thru. I have had success lately with just getting up and taking the dog outside immediately... but that takes some determination. Im not even sure how masterbating leaves me depressed, I can only imagine that its not what im doing with my time that leaves me unhappy, but what im not doing with my time that leaves me unhappy. I wonder if this blogging thing will end up being an excuse to avoid doing what I need to be doing.    so much potential can be mean nothing in the face of being content. thats a blog for another day.

       this is a blog, where i pretend that my existence is noteworthy enough to be followed or read by my fellow umans. I really dont know if this will last or if I will share it with anyone. perhaps ill just use it as a sort of diary so i can put form to my thoughts. i suppose that if i have given you this address then i have judged you worthy of my trust.  please remember this and follow the code of silence. what you read here is between You and I and anyone else with a computer. thats the secret. what is read is never to be spoken. you may write me at me email address (godslonelyman218@yahoo.com) and i shall reply, but never let thoughts concerning this blog... (sorry, i was choking on my own lack of charisma)  fall upon a living ear. Thank you for taking the time, it has always been worth it i hope. And please, never hold back....

      ive yet to figure what i do this thing for, i only write now to keep some form of perpetuation to it. perhaps itll die within another week. these good thoughts that become short term goals distract me... maybe they dont, perhaps they dont work out to be the thing i envisioned but i may walk away a slight wiser. an experience is valued for its elicited response.  Ive been reading a ton of fantasy football stuff lately, its fun, but sometimes i have to put it down because i feel this eerie sense that ive accomplished nothing with this form of chosen entertainment.

      sometimes things dont fall into place exactly as i had hoped they would, go figure. Mostly my response is in the stoic ballpark of things, but sometimes i just get hung up and cant seem to handle or deal with whatever emotion im lingering on the edge of. It amazes me exactly how much of a choice i really have in my repsonses as well. The initial sway is typically too strong, but if I get tripped up by it then it might prevail for a period of time. This initial emotional response is almost always unhelpful. When im caught up on an emotion i respond emotionally at which point ive entered the emotional league of play. In this league my response hinges on the assumption of others emotions as well (if my emotion is in response to another persons emotion). These assumptions  a: are typically wrong in at least the emotion or the extent of it.  b: come with predictable behavior which may be incongruent with behavior I would exhibit naturally.  These two things lead to a misdirected display which only leads to a more confusing personal interaction.  If I survive the initial emotional attack I may enter the natural response league where im a bit more logical but also influenced by the natural emotions present in the situation. If I make it past this response I get to the desired response of a stoic. this response allows me to react in the most productive and logical way possible. I devise a reaction that will get me the most efficient results to either help me deal with the situation as it has come to me or work to change things so Im not forced to deal with the situation in the future.  I guess this may not make all that much sense. Im just wishing I didnt hit that point where i get stuck on hold lingering on my inability to get exactly what I want.  I was asked a question once by a friend of mine, and i held back on the emotional end to my feelings and ended up not getting to share those emotions and moving on. This left me in a mind numbed state where i just wanted the opportunity to express the emotion but didnt feel that i had it.

        the thing about chicago that i really like is the public transportation. the L and the subway are the shit. you can go downtown and back for three bucks. then retreat to the suburbs to enjoy without the cluster of people and cement and metal. AND theres water. I love H2O. its right on lake michigan and theres the chicago river. plenty of bridges and interesting parks, especially those along the water. Its also a town of music. plenty of places and cool little bars to entertain. Theres a nice art museum, a celebrated field museum, and navy pier all along the water. Its a cool place to take a walk. It also helps to know good people there. thanks to them when i visit the city i have somewhere to stay. I feel welcome in chicago.

      sometimes i try and explain to people why it is that i hate my job. then i get frunstrated and stop myself and give the short answers, too much work not enough pay. True enough, this equation is apparently a necessity. When someone accepts a job they accept this as fact. Yet there are times when the job environment changes and then the employeed must reevaluate this agreement and determine if other options need to present themselves, such as asking for a raise, or seeking other employment within or without of the current place of work. Sadly when an increase in benefits is not available and the job market is as such, the job productivity suffers. This is a natural consequence of the workload overbearing the worker. I assume a greater amount of stress knowing that I am being forced to do more with less. I am expected to take up the slack left by people who rejected the changing equation and left for other options. too late are their gaps being filled. One thing can balance the pay = work equation, and thats support. support essentially lessens the stress of the work or lessens the perception of the stress of the work.  Support can be as simple as an outlet to voice experiences and such about the work. or support can be supervisorial intervention during greater work loads. The point is that support can take many shapes and forms, all of which are beneficial.  At my current job support consists of reading materials and the ability to answer questions to a satisfactory extent. both of these things recquire effort on my part. And as I am the one experiencing stress I should bear the burden of seeking out this support. Yet on any day I can lessen the stress by lessoning the productivity of my work.  There are many meetings that I sit thru on wendesdays to learn more but they usually consist of ego debates about the proper way to do things. I leave these meetings with the feeling that the best thing for me to do is do whats best at the time and use my own judgment.   enough already, this is what happens. I get caught up in ideas about how to perform my job rather than just performing to the best of my ability and valueing my own judgement rather than trying to do what I think they want me to do. There is no answer to the correct way to do things, one piece of advice was given to me that I value above all others and that is "do no harm". if i followed that and my own judgement im sure i would be fine. but i have trouble wading thru the what ifs and who would do whats and what shoulds that i dont get to the simplicity of 'what is right is to'.  hopefully i can break thru this and feel productive. its important to me that the lives im walking thru the day with are affected as best as possible after our time together. Nothing depresses me more than going to work on a day when im depressed and having it affect negatively a whole group of kids as well as myself.

      I want to understand where my feelings come from, I want to understand why i cant say the things i long to say or do the things i need to do. I want to know why i live amongst people that do as they do. Where is the purpose in living amongst this ocean of emotions that guides every conversation or interaction. I can no sooner tell those nearest me how i feel without suffering the wrath of preconceived notions. There is an answer to every question, and i fear i face the ugly response of perception. such an evil word perception is. anything is as i choose to label it and anything is beyond my ability to label and stand outside the relative truth. If i believed i could find the absolute truth to my words and get an answer devoid of fear and insecurity i would feel free. but those i speak to and myself, the great conspirer, have chosen to not rock the boat. We all know what to expect if we stick to the first response, the learned and devoid of any emotion other than the necessary response. my words have to go thru security before they can enter the open field of your thoughts. I love you.
