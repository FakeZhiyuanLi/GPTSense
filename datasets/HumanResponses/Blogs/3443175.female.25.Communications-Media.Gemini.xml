            Okay, has anyone seen these Blythe dolls? I think they are sooooo cool and I want one, now!   I know they probably look all freaky and scary and stuff, but they are so interesting. They were originally made in the 70s and were popular then, but are now making a come back, especially in Japan. Besides their humungous heads and gigantic eyes, another feature of the Blythe doll is that you can pull a string on the back of their head and their eye color changes! Can someone say AWESOME!?! Hahah! Also the popular thing is to make clothes for the dolls and you can sell them on ebay, and some of you know how I BE knitting stuff! On the other hand, I'm gonna be 25 and still playing with dolls, hmmm, how sad Karen, how sad.....  To check out more Blythe stuff go to:  urlLink This Is Blythe    P.S. MY BIRTHDAY IS NEXT MONTH ON JUNE 12th! I'd be ECSTATIC if ya'll bought one of these dolls! HHAHAH!!!!    P.P.S.S. Sorry to all my guy readers who have to endure this moment of Girlyness!  P.P.P.S.S.S. what the hell does  "P.S." mean??? anyone know???!

                So a few weeks ago I finally got to see a band, who I have been obsessing about, at Amoeba Records! I dragged Susan along with me and we had a fabulous time up front and center. Their music is gorgeous and sweet. I guess that's how I'd describe them, sugary sweet. Also the lead singer and bassist are brothers! How CUTE! I highly reccomend you go out and buy their new album "Trial of the Century." The album cover looks like someone's boob, yuck, but their previous album had a really cool looking owl smoking a cigarette.   Here's a little biography info on them that I got from Muchmusic.com:    "French Kicks are not a traditional rock'n'roll band. Although they have elements of snarly garage rock, slick new wave, and giddy classic mod-pop, they remain completely unique. The four of them work together like draughtsmen creating musical architecture - a note is never wasted, a drop is never spilled. Their songs always seem to be on an angle, hovering just at breaking point. They cut to the quick with lurching riffs and palpitating percussion, but they are also cute and coltish and undeniably catchy. At heart, this is simple pop music, with hooks hookier than velcro and disarmingly pretty three-part harmonies."  Check out their website, especially their video for "Close to Modern":   urlLink The French Kicks                             More proof of being there, hahah:       ^yeah that's me chillin with the French Kicks Yo!^

         This is interesting. Came across Wil Wheaton's blog. Used to have a huge crush on him. Now I can stalk him online, but is it really worth it, huh, I don't think so. No offense Willy.  Check it out:  urlLink Wil Wheaton dot net

         So this weekend I rented Live Forever, a documentary on Britpop in the 90s. I suggest any Oasis and Britpop fans rent this movie! Liam and Noel are hilarious!  Actually it was a whole U.K. filled movie weekend! I rented Sliding Doors featuring Gwyneth Paltrow or Martin or whatever. It was alright, I like movies about London, so that was the coolest part for me. And I also watched In America. I didn't finish it, I bet it was fantastic, but there are somethings that people who are stuggling financially shouldn't do, like bet your rent money on a stuffed animal.  Oh Yeah, on another note about Gwyneth and Chris Martin, have you checked you out the video on the Coldplay website in celebration of Apple? It's really funny but totally turned me off of Chris Martin, hahah.

Below is what I posted on the BRMC website after seeing them live at Canes Bar and Grill in San Diego:  "I saw them too!!!! They were soooo unfreakin believeable! And I got to meet them backstage too!!!!!!! And SOOO NICE! If you guys read this: Robert, Peter and Nick thank you, thank you, thank you so much for signing my Screaming Gun cd and being so kind to me, I'll never forget it!!!! I'm still so naturally high from that night! And that was badass when Robert jumped into the audience! I've never seen a band or concert with sooo much soul!   Thank you so much!

         Ahhh, okay, here's a new blog. I've been so bad at blogging lately cause really there hasn't been much goin on! So today I will bring your attention to another freakin awesome band called Delays. Now there is some controversy over if they are called "Delays" or "  The   Delays" oh well, they sound good either way. At first I thought the singers were girls, but they were just young guys with really high voices. I'm gonna be seeing them on July 28th at the Troubadour so I'll let you know if they sound like girls in person.    Their website:   urlLink The Delays

         Alright folks, I have never been so excited by a band, well since, last month I guess, but these guys are amazing! Their music is addictive, danceable, exciting, and will remind you of your synth-popped out 80's childhood! Their album, Hot Fuss, will be out on June 15th, and I'm gonna freakin be the first in line to get it.   Check them out and you will be forever in my debt:   urlLink The Killers

         Ahh! I'm so excited! Next week I'll be in San Diego for the big Comic-Con. Yes some might say I'm a nerd, but its nerd-by-association. Even though I'll be surrounded by hobbits, Stormtroopers, and Jedi, I'm mainly looking forward to visiting Extraordinary Desserts! It's a dessert restaurant that only serves yummy things like cake, creme brulee, ice cream, etc. A lot of their desserts are decorated with Fresh flowers and gold leaf when it's served to you. As some of you know, I'm on a diet, but shoot, I'll make an exception for this place.   Check it Out:   urlLink Extraordinary Desserts
