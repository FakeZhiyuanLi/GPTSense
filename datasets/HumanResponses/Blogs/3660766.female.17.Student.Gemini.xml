Also i have a new celeb crush, well not crush lol but i like Jude Law now, hes hott!! lol hes got those eyes that make u melt! lol well rara is in love with Orlando bloom, krissy will always love Ben Affleck ( i did once! ) lol and i like Jude Law now! o well, we can always dream cant we?! lol Seeing Love movies makes u think about when ur gonna find the right person to spend the rest of ur life with, and i thought i did once, but now i know that i didnt.

      well today was bad in general. Well last night i had this long talk with adam and eli and they both were cracking jokes on greg, cody, matt, and beaner... at first it was funny to hear what they were saying about these boys, but after awhile i was like getting tired of it, so i stuck up for the people who basically made fun of me and told me that they hated me... then i antiqued krissy ( pouring flour all over someone when they are sleeping) she woke up the next morning and didnt know what the fuck happened... it was funny. Then i slept in till 2... heres where it gets good. I went to borders and bought the Book (a fat girls guide to life) and i started reading it and got sucked in bc what this woman went thru is everything i have been thru, and i have had the same feelings about things and its just nice to hear someone else that has survived a weight battle. See it takes me so long to lose weight, then i gain it back, like i have been doing already :( so ive been all down and depressed about it, but reading this book is making me feel better. Then i went to krissys and rara was there, and i was already in a bad mood, and they made comments about me being a princess, and idk why , but it pissed me off so i left, i cried to my mom down at her work and i was crying about everything but what happened at krissys lol it was like i needed to cry about alot of shit. ( ive been a sap lately, ill cry over n e thing lol ) then i went home and got on my pjs (i was in hoochie mamma clothes and didnt want to be n e more lol ), and went back to krissys where rara and heather were and we all decided we would play monopoly, where i was winning by a shit load, and heather was fucking around on the computer, and she wasnt even paying attention and what happens??? i land on her boardwalk and lose  ALL of my money except for 6 bucks! but i came back and got in 2nd place with 8,580! so that and stick it in ur piehole! lol and we played Monopoly for 5 hours, lol which is sad considering it was a friday night lol OH and heather told friggin David that i had sex with Derek! so now David is gonna tell people all this shit, and its just gonna make my life hell.. lol but o well , so yah tonight was pretty much drama and we ended it on a low note... altho now im grounded bc i got home at 3:37 and thats too "late" so poor me... but ill be out tomorrow, u watch and see.. :) Grounded at my house? Nahhh!!

      well tonight kirby and i decided we would go to the Marion County fair, we were having a blast until i was like, lets ride the Hammer! the hammer is a ride that goes upside down and stays there, then spins around. Well krissy and i get front row and we sitting in these seats, well the guy kept going around and checking the other side to see if their seats locked, and didnt check ours. My latch thingy def. didnt lock but everyone elses did, so its like really loose and moving around. I called the guy over and he was saying something when he walked away, i thought maybe he was gonna fix it, NO THE IDIOT started the RIDE! so i was like KRISSSSSSY! and she was like omg omg omg, so we start getting higher and at this point we arent upside down yet but we are close, im holding on to this chest bar thing like its a fucking fudge bar and i aint letting go. Well we get upside down and the fucker decides to keep us upside down for like 2 mins. im holding on, crying, and screaming and other people are screaming too but they are doing it bc they are retards. So n e ways, the ride starts to end and i get off, and my shoulders are like killing me bc i was holding on so tight that the bar was resting on my shoulders so i wouldnt fall. i get home, and look at my shoulders, i have blood blisters on them. thats the last time im ever gonna ride a fair ride that goes upside down!

      Well i just got done watching Euro trip and it makes me wanna go back to Europe so bad! I could honestly see myself living there when i get older.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get to go back to Germany next summer with my mommie, thats gonna be cool. Its just gonna be like a family reunion thing, almost all of my family lives in germany, so i hardly get to see them. ******ok im gonna vent for a sec... and krissy knows what im talking&nbsp;about,&nbsp;bc we endure this shit all the time back in&nbsp;good ole hick indy&nbsp;( Who's gonna smuggle in the beer? man i need beer! i wish i could drink right now! - this is what&nbsp;almost all of my stuck up classmates say, i mean its almost required for them to say that at least&nbsp;once a day!)&nbsp;Whats really fucked up tho when u go to Europe&nbsp;with a group of american teenagers is that they are so fucking dumb that they cant get over the No drinking age limit&nbsp;rule. Its like every where we went it was like, omg i cant believe we can drink, i was like um ok, but what about the CULTURE?! I mean ya i had my share of drunken nights and drunken fights with krissy... HEY KRISSY, MY EYES ARE BLURRY! lol yah her and i actually got into a fight bc i said something then took it back! good times! we were yelling at each other in the middle of a street in Austria! lol And u know ur bad off when ur best friend takes the shaving razor away from u... lol well n e ways back to what i was saying is that, when u go to europe and u see so much culture and things that are 1000's of years old, then u make ur way back to Good Ol`e Indiana, u realize what ur missing. I mean in Indy we treasure the Circle, and omg watch out for the Farmers Market, EVERY WED! i mean come on, these arent things to be excited over folks! People might think im just talking about nothing now and maybe laugh at me, but until u go there and realize how big of a joke the US really is, u wont understand. Its like, we only get Patriotic after something tragic happens ( 9/11) or near 4th of july... its almost like our country is a joke.

      Holy Fuck! I had the weirdest dream ever! whats sad is that i have strange dreams everynight but this one is weird. lemme tell&nbsp; yall about it... first i was at this college campus with like hundreds of other kids and come to find out , we are doing While u were out, for this old house that was on campus, well i was in chase dakotas group and andrew dan jumbo, was sitting right next to me! LOL lemme tell u ladies, he is as hot in my dreams as he is on tv! lmao So ne ways, our group consisted of Andrea Dan Jumbo, Chase Dakota, me , and my neighbor Jess, and thats all. Well we were gonna put this decorative painting on this old desk and it was my job to draw two weiners on the side, and when i say weiners i mean Pigs, Chase kept calling them weiners to make andrew think she was talking sexual, why? i have no clue, lol so i decided i would go to the queen of england who was in the other room so she could help me draw my "weiner" and when i get there, Jess already was there and the queen was like Oh ur drawing is the best, and i was like thats not fair! Then when i get done with my picture me and jess go back to the room, and we notice that NO ONE is in this building n e more and theres blood everywhere, so were like freaking out, so we run back to the queen and shes like, its ok girls, i have protective lions that look after me... LOL so she calls upon the lions but forgets to tell them that jess and i are her friends, so we are hiding from these lions. well we get outside and we notice that EVERYTHING is 1970's as if we went back in time, but then i hear this woman complaining about where her car went and this man was like, what year is it and she was like its an 85 and he goes, its over there with the rest of the traitor cars, so i knew that we didnt go back in time. Well n e ways i meet up with this family that i dont even know lol and they are talking about their grandpas funeral, and i was like tagging along with them, so we are in this room, and i see this old man sitting on this chair, and it was the grandpa, and he was still alive! but they were gonna see if he was old enough to kill him, and i was like wtf and they decided he was old enough so they were picking out a good method for him to die, and they were shooting arrows at this target and no one was able to hit it, except for this 3 yr old boy, and he got every arrow to hit the target bc , and this is what a man said " the got smaller hands and better aim so they can hit anything" then after this family killed grandpa they were singing this alabama song, and it was my turn to sing it and i was like, i dont know it, im from indiana, and the lil 3 yr old boy was like NO NO NO u cant be here ! and i just sat there, while they went on singing the song... and that was my dream!&nbsp; lol i woke up and was like wtf! lol i dont think i can ever watch while u were out, or see a grandpa again, without gettting the willies.lol&nbsp;&nbsp; : )

      well this summer i have been thinking about my whole life, and wondering if im even worth the shit i go thru. prob not... ive been thinking alot about my dad and all the shit that went on with him and wondering what things would have been like if he was around. Him even being around once a year would be so great to me, but he doesnt even care about me enough to do that. Then i think about all the bad shit he has done to my mom and then i dont want him around. I just dont think people realize how hard it is to grow up without a dad and not even knowing where he is at. i remember when i was younger and people would ask me questions about my dad or my family on that side in general and i felt like the biggest idiot bc i had no clue. which all led to many nights of crying myself to sleep, which still go on today... lol yah i know, im 17 and still cry bc my dad isnt here. So i promised myself that i would never have kids if i wasnt sure that my children wouldnt have a happy family and a stable one at that.

      Well Well Well... long time no post. Not much has happened tho, except me and a couple friends fucked up dereks car bc hes an ass and deserved it. Man it felt so good doing it, it was as if i was like getting rid of that part of my life, and going out&nbsp;with a bang lol Rara came home sat. and i felt like the biggest tard. We were going to the airport to meet her there, and we missed her! she walked right passed us and we didnt even see her...only something that stupid would happen to me lol Im so glad shes back, its been nothing but laughs since shes been back. :) ive come to this part in my life where i need to focus on me. Im tired of worrying about others feelings and hurting myself in the process. ive been speaking my mind more often and i know im pissing people off while im doing it but at this point, it doesnt matter to me n e more. Im not even sorry if i hurt someones feelings along the way, bc for so long i was hurting myself bc those idiots where assholes and were bringing me down. well im gonna go and be lazy bc im sick with a god damn chest cold! :(

SO tonight is gonna be a catching up time and idk what we'll do after that. I feel like camping or something, and not the Camper camping bc thats gay, u might as well stay home, im talking about out in the wilderness camping, where u could be tore to shredds by a wild bear or something lol altho i dont like bugs so well see how good that goes. Oh heres a lil recap of what happened to andrea and that whole shindig, Remember how she said i didnt have n e friends and that my friend mel and brianna and everyone was talking shit behind my back ? well i told them and they were like wtf, we dont even talk to andrea, so they got EVERYONE to call her and harrass her, lifes great. ok i gotta go, ttyl i will write later

      Yip Yap! tonight was informational. Derek told me that he loved my thighs and that i had great boobs lol i was like thank u, and i kept telling krissy, "we're leaving" lol i think that pissed him off but o well. he also told me that he liked me last year, i was like thanks lol i mean what good does that do? lmao Hes the most sexual guy i know, he kept touching my legs and shit bc he said they were smooth, and he asked to slap my thigh and ass. I dont really like any of that tho, bc it makes me feel like hes just an asshole and only wants sex, which is prob true but it doesnt matter n e ways bc i aint gonna go out with him. I noticed that im either NOT ENOUGH for a guy or im just a sexual object to another, so either way i suck at what im doing&nbsp;bc i lose every guy i like or the one i love&nbsp;. . . lol its really been a blow to my self esteem. This summer has been an eye opener really, i learned that i should never be in a relationship bc i just end up hurting someone or getting hurt. Im tired of being let down by my feelings..

      *turning over a new leaf?* Ive decided to put myself out there again and just meet new people and not be completely focused on my love life and if something happens it happens. I think that was my major prob. That isnt like me either. Im usually laid back and if something happens it happens and i completely did a 180 and turned into the people i used to crack jokes on, so im gonna stop and let things fall into place, and if they dont, then i was made out to be an old shrew lol Onto my night,&nbsp; Well tonight krissy and i decided to see what the hell was going on with the whole andrea thing, lemme break it down for ya.. 1. andrea made rude comments about me and my friends 2. I fucked up her car with choc. syrup and shit and it ruined parts of her engine and not to mention took forever to wash off lol :) 3. she assumed it was me, without any proof 4. i denied it and was like ur crazy 5. found out derek told her the whole shindig including all the details (hes a&nbsp;NUTSTAIN!) 6. admitted it and made her feel like shit while doing it 7. she came back and said all my friends werent my friends 8. i told them about it and they went crazy on her and now she feels even more like shit 9. im happy :)  There i broke it down for everyone lol  well after that was all worked out, i got to punch the shit out of derek and hurt my hand in doing it, then he was trying to get something from me and he grabbed my wrist and like broke the fucker, it like popped and a sharp pain went thru my arm and i yelped in pain lol then he did it to the other one on accident. So i tried to wrestle him to the ground but i completely forgot he is a tackle on the football team and he took me out and knocked the wind out of me, and at this point im all beaten and bruised lol then we left dereks and got mountain dew, my forbidden fruit! lol and we strolled meijer with these grandma sunglasses on and then came home, not too shabby for a thurs night. Tomorrow night tho is gonna be another story and I cant even explain the fun we are gonna have sat night when rara comes home, She called today and she was telling me how she got fucked up and woke up in her own vomit, THATS MY GIRL! :) k im outtie! tootlez!!

      Well its 12:08 and im watching Bad Boys 2. This movie is soo funny. I love Will! hes so cute plus hes funny. and we cant forget about martin! I used to watch that show... Martiiiiin, im&nbsp;the man! lol well n e ways, today was a&nbsp;pretty slow day, i went shopping with my mom at the&nbsp;Old Time Pottery store. She loves that place.. lol then i came home and just helped her clean and all that&nbsp;good stuff.&nbsp;I think this is the first time i stayed in&nbsp;all summer lol i&nbsp;have been usually out and about, but tonight it was low key for me.&nbsp;I wanna go see a movie so bad, im thinking I.Robot, or Anchorman, idk i just wanna see something good. I wish there was like a horror flick out, a really good one, i feel like being scared shitless. i REALLY wanna be on fucking scare tactics or something, i just want someone to scare the fuck out of me LoLz me and tony ( moms bf) were talking once and i told him that when i die, i wanna go out like Texas Chainsaw&nbsp; Massacre people, i wanna be scared shitless and then skinned alive! lmao jk on the skinnin alive part but i do wanna be scared soon. Idk its like the feeling u get before u go into a haunted house, its like ur scared and anxious, yah i love that feeling. I also love the feeling of Fall where u know Halloween is coming up. wow i completely started rambling here lol Well lets see what else happened this week, OH OH OH dereks gf came into town and i got to meet her and lemme say this, she is like a spokes model for Progeria lmao she was talking about how she aint easy or whatever and the next day she lost it to Derek, LMAO i was like&nbsp;yah fucking right ur easier than shit, and whats the kicker to the story would have to be, THATS THE 2ND TIME IN HISTORY THAT THEY HAVE EVER MET!!!!!!!! now u cant sit there and say she aint easy. im so glad im over him, i think he was a rebound, bc now i look back on it all and&nbsp;laugh, i mean this was the kid&nbsp;that i basically tore up with the&nbsp;jokes and then all of a sudden i liked him, oh hell no!! LMAO &nbsp;I just need to get my life rolling again and be who i was a long time ago. Recently i havent been me and that bothers the hell out of me, ive been all self conscious and what not and just being a baby. I mean yah i trashed someones car, which would be something i would do, but the real me would have taken&nbsp;a shit on her seats , LMAO omg im soo slap happy now. Well Rara is coming back in T minus 76 hours 28 mins and 3 sec... Jk on all of that , but my partner in crime is coming back on Sat, and i got her a gift, a jesus fish for her car, bc it will keep her safe (inside joke). I dont think people realize how much she hates those fuckin things, its like when she sees one she goes anna nicole smith nuts on them. She better like it tho bc i had to go into a friggin Catholic store to get one of those, and if u know me, Catholic people drive me BANANAS! and guess what? im catholic lol i just cant stand the whole, Save us jesus talk they got going on, its like , Do u fucking believe in the Easter bunny too? Thats what the whole God thing is to me. See god sits right next to santa claus and the easter bunny, and they are&nbsp;all waiting for the tooth fairy to show up so they can fuck her in the ass. and OMG i just cant believe i said that lol See ive been programed so that when i say shit like that i feel as if i gotta go pray for my sins now, its so fucked up, the whole thing is fucked up. but not as fucked up as our president, altho i kinda feel sorry for him. Idk i just have pity for someone who tries so hard, and fails at it lol Altho i dont like Kerry either, his droopy eyed self can eat shit too. I want CLINTON BACK! i hate the rule about how many terms u can serve. I still think CLINTON was our Hottest president, and he sits right up there with Kennedy. Ok enough of politics bc this shit is making me mad lol Ok onto another subject i wanna get out, Greg. Now alot of people can laugh in my face and say shit about me bc i honestly dont think ill ever get over him. I dont care how many people leave me notes in this blog saying "HAHAHA" CODY! bc honestly ur opinion doesnt mean n e thing to me when it comes to him, now i do respect ur opinions on other topics tho so keep on ranting about shit that matters. Ok back to greg, i dont think he realizes how much he really does matter to me. i think he always thought that i was like oh i have a bf and shit and thats completely not true, and i feel bad bc if thats how he really felt and that i didnt really show him affection then im sorry. I think thats the first time i actually apologized about the whole thing, i mean yah i said sorry for shit i said but u gotta remember i have been to hell and back with the whole mess lol and whats so strange is still after what all happened i still want him, now i am willing to except the fact that he has a gf and i bet shes great but its kinda like i got the disadvantage to the whole shindig bc she was there when he visited his friends and i wasnt. But hey some people need constant affection from people, and i guess it had to be physical, i mean idk, thats just how i look at it, but im cool with it. I am just simply stating that i still love him and even if he doesnt love me n e more thats ok, i just wanted to get that out there. and hopefully he will always be one of my good friends. Ok thats all i got to say at the moment

       theres something wrong with me, i feel as if im missing something in my life. I dont feel complete. I was driving home tonight and alls i could think about was how something isnt right and i was thinking about my life and what i didnt have. idk maybe im a baby for complaining alot about my life..who knows.. Ne ways tonight was filled with randomness. Krissy and i went to briannas party which when we arrived was already filled with the most random people from Eamon to Adrian, so i was like um ok, then brett and zach kyle showed up and mel said something about Dustin coming, so krissy and i were like ok we're leaving, besides alls i heard people talking about was how they are gonna get drunk, even Ross Sergi puked before hand so he could hold more beer. i was like ur so dumb. well we left and went and checked out matts new car which is nice, except it reminds me of a mommy car, it needs tinted windows or something, then krissy and i just drove around and when we were doing that we saw nooner and he waved us down, and we sat in a BP parking lot chatting with noone, hilstrom, and other boys, then we were like ok were leaving, and noone was like. STAY SAFE lol then we went and drove some more and some more, and now im all driven out, and then i went over to dereks alone, and he said soemthing about the sore on his dick bc of what his gf did and i was like um ok, it was like he was trying to make me jealous so i left ... and now im alone and on the ride home is when i was thinking about what is missing in my life and how i dont feel complete. I dont know if this is a father thing or something else, i just feel like my life is empty. Or this could be a greg thing... idk .. i just know something is missing in my life, and i hate it...

      Well tonight was going great till derek called greg up. Perfect huh? Then they were both threatenin to kick each others asses. and i felt so helpless bc i could get derek off the phone and it was basically a fight over who has the biggest dick , or thats how it felt like. Now all these feelings are going thru my head again, about shit that happened and why it did and just stupid shit i should forget about. I thought i was gonna be ok and i was ready to move on, but obiviously not bc if i was i wouldnt be thinking about this shit n e more.

      Well tonight i was basically in my car the whole time, which wasnt bad considering who i was sitting next to lol Well ill break it all down for ya... Tonight kirby came over and we decided we would go buy Rara a Jesus Fish bc she hates those fuckers and it would be a sweet gift for her for when she gets back home... I miss her so much! Then we went to heathers but heathers sexy ass was still in the shower so we decided to go to Manual and pick derek up from night school , he basically skipped it to be with us :) then we went back to heathers and decided to chill awhile, and heather and i got into the old rap music that she was blasting thru out her house lol good times lol then we went driving, and i made krissy drive my car so i could sit next to derek, it was FuN! lol Then we went deep into the ghetto to pick up Sarah, shes like this knock out italian girl who should be on like the sopranos, BADA BING! LoLz! then we just drove around and yelled at people and just chilled and had fun! I have the most fun when i just relax with friends, idk its like i can be so lazy around them lol i mean i didnt even drive my own car lol Now tomorrow i think krissy and i are going out, she has a college class at 6 but when thats done, we are heading out into the town. but tonight was alot of fun id have to say, and whats gonna be even better is when derek comes over tomorrow to pick up his books, *wink wink* lol i dont know why i like him so much now, its like when i look at him or am even around him i just wanna start kissing him as if he is my bf ya know? ever have that feeling? i just wanna hug him all the time and never let go, ok now i sound corny lol but thats how i feel. I havent felt like this since i dated greg, not even around dustin did i feel like this, so basically it must be a greg/derek thing, who knows...

Yah if u didnt know derek is a nosetackle for Roncalli, and he said that before every game the guys would name who they wanna fuck and shit, and me and krissy got all the juicy shit lol Then we all started talking about like who we liked and what we look for in a rship.

Idk where i got these feelings from all of a sudden, but its really nice to start having feelings for someone else. lets just hope this isnt a rebound. altho i dunno what i would be reboundin from?

      from a really good Norah Jones Song... i love her, she sings about things that really hit close to home...  As I sit and watch the snow Fallin' down I don't miss you at all I hear children playin' laughin' so loud I don't think of your smile  So if you never come to me You'll stay a distant memory Out my window I see light doing dark Your dark eyes don't haunt me  And then I wonder who I am Without the warm touch of your hand  And then I wonder who I am Without the warm tough of your hand As I sit and watch the snow Fallin' down  I don't miss you at all I don't miss you at all I don't miss you at all

No one knows what im talking about, but i havent told n e one, bc its none of their business. lol Im thinking that maybe im holding on to the wrong things in my life. I need to focus on myself and stop thinking about things that happened in my life and just move on.

      Last night was so kickass, I almost blew off my hands! Muhahaha lol krissy and i went over to Phils House and hes like the most dangerous guy i know lol Well first off, phil decided that it would be cool if krissy and i got in the bed of the truck and he drove like 100 thru his streets, and being the retarded we are, we decided to do it, but first we got a lil pep talk from his brother who basically said that we werent thinking bc i was drinking a beer, standing in the bed of a truck while someone without a liscense goes about 100 mph. lol he just started laughing and we went on our merry way. So here we are flying around corners and im just drinking my drink and krissys like Man were smart! lol Then after we did that, which was SO MUCH FUN! we decided to set off fireworks, and i had this bright idea to put the firecrackers in this can and i would be the one who put the lid on, so phil lit it and im just sitting there holding the lid and slowly putting it on and all of a sudden it goes off, and i ran so fast, i almost blew my hands off lol kick ass huh ? Then we watched Steve-o's dont try this at home dvd, and i have to say that steve-o is fuckin aweeeesome. Then we all went to heathers and gave her back her alien, lol lonnnng story lol then us three saw this nice car and these boys came ot of it , so when they went inside steak and shake, we threw shit on it lol and we saw them run out of the steak n shake lol it was sooo funny. We had a very destructive night lol U know what i give our night? an F PLUS ! it rawked so hard! lol now Wed night we are cutting phils hair into a mullet, cant wait for that!

      By the title im sure u know that something big happened.. and OH it did! Ok tonight i went to the movies with Heather, rara, derek and phil and we are all watching Predator VS Alien and when we leave we go grab some dinner, after that we go to phils to hang out. Well Derek and i were walking around the house, when i get this urge to just kiss him. So i stop him and just lean in and kiss him, NO TONGUE OR N E THING, just innocent. : ) Well after that he was shocked that i actually made a move or whatever, so all night hes like touching me and holding on to me, which felt great! lol i love it when guys just hold on and hug u and all that good stuff. So n e ways, i went into phils kitchen and i was looking out the window when derek comes up behind me and im cornered in the kitchen and he just leans in and kisses me, but this time i push him away. it didnt feel right, it was as if i was trying to make myself think he was someone else, *cough* we all know who! lol Well then i think i hurt his feelings, but i told him flat out that i didnt want him and stuff and that i know i was basically a tease lol and i told him that my heart belonged to someone else. and he goes.... WHAT IF I LOVED U ?! ( and he was serious!) and thats when i was like omg , so heather takes me into her car and her and i talked about the whole situation which made me think about things, but my feelings for derek still dont come close to what i have for someone else. So n e ways, derek doesnt get the hint and hes like touching me and laying on me, thats when my mom called and was like, its 2 AM where the fuck are u ! lol she prob thought i went to CANADA or something lol so i jumped up lol and i went home lol and that was my fun filled night. Very informative!!! i never thought that derek pendley would have utter the words I love u , to me, none the less to any girl! LOL good times i know.. now i am gonna go to bed and think about everything that happened tonight and make some kind of sense out of all of it...

      I really like that song, i just cant figure out who sings it. Well lets see, Tomorrow is my moms birthday and shes gonna be (shhhh 42) To me that seems so old. I dont even wanna think about the day when im 42. Her birthday made me wonder if im gonna be able to do and have all the things i wanted in my life before i grow old. Im always scared that im gonna get older and never find someone to spend the rest of my life with. That scares me to death. Im also afraid that im not gonna make alot of money. Growing up me and my mom never had alot of money and i dont wanna go thru what my mom did with my family( if i have one lol) Idk i look at my mom sometimes and i wonder if shes happy with how her life turned out. I feel so bad , my mom would have been able to do alot more if she didnt have me, and i feel like i held her back. I know shes not happy, and i wish i could make everything better. To see my mom laugh and smile would be the day. and with her birthday tomorrow shes even more depressed. Ok im done with that topic, its making me all sad lol I got my hair chopped off everyone! Hoooooray! lol My ends were fried bc of my dying habits so i had them hacked off and now my hair is all pretty again! : ) well i am gonna go and tidy up my room so i can have some people over.  :)

Good times i know! I just need to get this whole thing moving. Well my mom today said i could go to Chicago if i wanted to, ( for college) so now i have to choose, whether i want to go to Kent State, or Chicago. Chicago is gonna be so much different than Indy!  but i think i might choose that one just bc its in a bigger city and all that good junk. Well lets see, on the guy front, im doing Really well! theres this one boy named david, and hes sweet and funny, and idk what else i can say about him. he makes me laugh, hes friends with phil tho so hes crazy.

      Well i have been having good convos with people i havent talked to in a while. Last night i chatted with David B. and he basically kept telling me he was hard and masturbation and him and i having sex lol , and i mentioned something about him and i NOT dating and he was like oh why not? and i was like shocked, so idk whats going on there,I do know that if him and i do date, the whole seeing each other naked thing is out of the way! he stripped for krissy and i and when we were leaving he jumped on krissy car and she went in reverse really fast and it burned his balls! lol funny i know. He can be so sweet but i do know how he feels about women having power and hes very, Im the man and ur the woman, so u better listen to me, type of guy and im not that type of girl,lol so idk.. i guess we'll see. And tonight i had a LONG convo with Amy. Now if u dont know who amy is , amy is one of the members of the fudgesters, and if u dont know who they are, lol they are a group consisting of me, sarah, krissy, and amy. Everyone at hns wanted to be in the group but we were like no! and we were all best friends and it was kickass! well i remember hns graduation and i remember crying bc i knew i wasnt gonna ever see them again and i remember amy saying, we'll always be close and hang out, and guess what, that shit didnt happen. Sarah and amy grew apart and they basically forgot about krissy and i. Well amy and i chatted about everything that happened in our lives , like old bfs, sex, drugs, friends, drama and all that good crap. it was nice just opening up with her again.

Last night was almost too much for me to stomach! lol I was riding the roller coaster Face Off, and steve Martin was next to me, and instead of the safety bar, they had a chain holding us in! I was like UH HUH this aint gonna hold my girth, and this geeky guy with zits was like here this will help, and he put twisties that hold ziplocks closed on my chain! i was like UR CRAZY! lol then we took off and i was safe lol, so i praise those twisties! Then my mom being the sweet heart she is, she was like its a sign ur gonna die on that ride lol and she thought it was funny, but im scared now lol I think im gonna keep my fat ass on the ground and stay away from rides this sunday. Alls i know is that rara and i are gonna be having a kickass time at the water park! : )

      *Breathe in, and let it all out* why do people fight over simple things? whats the point? isnt life fucked up enough without peoples insignificant problems just to cloud our minds even more? i mean theres more things to do than fight over stupid shit but yet peoples time and energy goes toward fighting over nothing. ive come to the conclusion that im not gonna let peoples "problems" or their "short-comings" get in my way of having a great senior year. Ive been thru so much stupid shit with Andrea, Deidra, Derek, Phil, Matt and the rest of those people to last me a life time. They are the only ones i know that start a fight with people over something they read in a NOTE, oh yes i said it, a NOTE! i think i went thru that shit when i was like 12 but no they are still doing it at 17 and 18, so i decided i would just seperate myself from them, bc im not gonna stress myself out over their child like behavior. Now i know what ur thinking, " Tatji is just like that!" Well alls i have to say to that is, Oh buddy ur so wrong. Im DONE with all of that. They only thing i gained from them was my stress level and my weight lol i need to put my body and MY life before their games bc im not gonna be the goofy 17 yr old any more after this school year. Im gonna be on my own, and i need to mature, i mean ya ill be the goofy 18 yr old but hopefully ill be more mature and maybe take things more seriously. i think at this point in my life, im really ready for something serious to happen. Ive always been the person to goof around and just take life as a joke and not as a gift and as corny as that sounds it is a gift and im gonna use it to my full advantage. Theres so much i could be doing and i should be doing it, rather than messing around and just being mixed up in stupid fights and seeing who said what and who fought who. Life is more than drama, its more than fights, its more than "who fucked who", its more than how much money u make, its a G-I-F-T, DONT WASTE IT!- *pillow* : )

      Me and rara went to go see the Village last night, and i give that movie 5 stars! i love movies that make u think, but i thought too much and figured it out in like 30 mins but it was awesome n e ways. Plus it had one good looking actor in it, Jaquen Phoenix ( idk how to spell his first name) I think hes gorgeous, hes got that mysterious look to him. Then rara and i were craving milkshakes so we went to SnS and greg called me which was surprising, i was like wow ! lol So he called me when i got home with was around 1:30 and we talked for a lil bit. I swear that kid confuses me to death. I dont know what he wants or what hes thinking. At times i think i got him figured out and then he changes on me. i wish i could just get some clear cut answers to my questions but he always leaves me with more lol like he asked me to come up there today , which made me think why? why should i drive all the way up to bfe and for what? i mean yah him and i are good friends still, but honestly theres no reason for me to drive up there, so i can just hang out with him. bc then im gonna be thinking about things and im gonna be wantin to do things, and thats not my place, so its just easier if i say no. Its almost as if he knows im gonna say no, and he only asks me to come up there, so i think about everything.  idk whats going on n e more, im just about to give up trying to figure things out. He knows i love him, and hes told me that hell always love me, and im starting to think if this is all another game, or whats going on. ... well im gonna go and spend some money on good ole Torrid.
