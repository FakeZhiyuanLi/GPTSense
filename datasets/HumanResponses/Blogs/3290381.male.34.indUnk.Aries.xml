      It's not often you get a  urlLink triple play  of news - especially one that tags the top bushies out.    It's not often that  urlLink atrocities like those committed within Abu Ghraib  lead to good things, but maybe we'll see the neo-cons booted to the curb and jailed as  urlLink war criminals .  The best place for criminals like Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz is jail.  Specifically Abu Ghraib with Iraqi prison guards.  Any jail, however, will do for thesewar crimes.

      Yes, we did indeed spend our weekend in lovely  urlLink Carroll, Iowa.   Best part of Carroll - I bought 2 rounds of drinks for 6 people that included 2 quarts of Bloody Marys - total cost $20.  Of course, our car keys now reside at the Carrollton Inn.  They were not much help on our return home Sunday night.  Great thanks to our Metrocars driver who had pity on us and took us home and then back to the airport, with the return trip being free!  It was a long weekend.  Many drinks consumed, much Iowa scenery observed, and many trips to the airport made (I lost count after 6). It was, however, a great time - especially thanks to many of Carleton College's finest and the new friends we met. (Hard to believe that a) I didn't do anything offensive and b) that people would like me at first meeting)  And we got to go for a run.  Who would have ever guessed that there is a paved, multi-use trail running between a drainage canal and a cornfield.  It may not sound impressive to many of my loyal readers, but they are scarce in Michigan and thus I would not expect to find one in the middle of nowhere.  While not the Central Park loop, it was not a bad run.  Word to the wise - after a long night of drinking, do not listen to your partner when she freaks out early the next morning and insists on getting ready to leave in 15 minutes.  It results in an $80 metrocar ride.

Yes, that Rummy is doing a bang-up job.  No need to fire him.  His oversight of Abu Gharib and his lean and mean army of mercenaries has been exemplary.

      I'm not sure how accurate he is, but here's a link to a blogger that thinks there is an emerging  urlLink democratic majority.   Sort of contradicts this morning's  urlLink Brooks column  in the Times.  Though I find Brooks to be a one-dimensional columnist - beating the polarization horse to death - his piece today was interesting not because he revisited the polarization theme again, but because he brought up the Bayh-McCain proposal for voluntary national service as a way to bridge ideological gaps in our culture.  Why not take it a step further and require either national service or military service.  At least the rich would have to do national service provided there are no favors that can be granted ala Bush and his national guard "service".  Would people really object to having to spend a year rebuilding cities, upgrading rural infrastructure and planting trees?  And if they object, should we abandon the idea?  Hardly.  Remember JFK, "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country".    Sadly most of us do nothing, but  we can and should step up.  And since we can't entice anyone to serve except those without opportunity, perhaps it is time to require service.  Maybe then we can reinstill a civic ethic in our citizenry.

      I'm so tired of David Brooks.  Isn't it enough that the venerable Times has the evil William Safire writing 2 columns a week?  Come on - Safire worked for Nixon - you would think that's all the right-wing writing they could ever need.  And I certainly wouldn't call Maureen Dowd or Tom Friedman, the star columnists, liberal.  I guess they think Safire and Brooks balance out Bob Herbert and Paul Krugman.    But this article about  urlLink Brooks' new book  illustrates why he's become boring and irrelevant.

      These moderate Republicans deserve support and kudos for their vote against the Bush-Santorum hate amendment:  Lincoln Chaffee, RI Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Maine John McCain, Arizona Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Colorado John Sununu, NH*  * Our support of Sununu should be measured, he is usually a real zealot, and I'm not sure why he joined with the rational wing of the Republican party on this vote.  And while we're at it, let's boo some of our democratic senators who voted for the hate amendment:  Robert Byrd, West Virginia Zell Miller, GA (we all know he's really a republican) Ben Nelson, Nebraska  yuck.  It makes sick that any of these men get money from our party.   And it is also worth noting that when running a spell-check, the computer wants to replace santorum with sanatorium.

      From  urlLink Maureen Dowd  this morning:    Mr. Bush, by contrast, took full personal irresponsibility. Still pressing the preposterous case that he has made America safer, even though we are inundated with threats from Al Qaeda, and that he is winning the war against terror, even though there are more terrorist attacks, the president had to go farther afield to find a sufficiently enthusiastic audience.   Her new colleague, Barbara Ehrenreich (who is sitting in for Tom Friedman until October) is also  urlLink right on this morning .  Americans do tend to engage in "groupthink" and since we are showing how ignorant we are (Americans give Bush a 55% approval rating for his war on terror, but overwhelmingly reject the idea of the Iraq war), I suppose we're getting what we deserve for being a nation of fat, lazy and mean-spirited people.    We need to change the debate in this country.  It isn't about right versus left anymore, the right has turned policy-making into a religious crusade.  Religion is bad.  I maintain that aside from helping individuals cope with grief, it has not contributed in a positive way to society. What religion does is divide our nation and our planet and results in war and death and hatred.  All this for the concept of one vision of "god" being superior to another.    What we need now is a return to pragmatic civic duty.  JFK's words have never had more meaning, and today I put them forward to the three people who follow the blog,  "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"

      We have all sorts of bad news today... Enough to make you sick.  And more than enough to be ashamed to be a citizen of our great nation.  1. Bush still thinks the world is safer thanks to his Iraq debacle.  urlLink Unbelievable .  I always thought the sign of intelligence was being able to admit when you are wrong.  Guess this proves that theory.  2. Satan's apprentice, Secretary of Agriculture Ann Venneman, announced the administration is trying to  urlLink scuttle the Clinton-era ban on new roads in wilderness areas.   To the layman, this may not seem significant, however, this decision will serve to fragment habitat, further threatening species, habitats and ecosystems. Morons.  What won't they do for a buck.  3. Roger Clemens is starting tonight's baseball All-Star game.   urlLink He is a jerk.  And he's fat .   4.  This is perhaps the most disturbing event -  urlLink Congressional extremists are attempting to politicize our constitution by adding an amendment prohibiting rights for a group .  I'm sure Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA)is perhaps the least qualified individual ever to be in a position to influence a change in our nation's constitution. Are those in the religious right so insecure about their own marriages that they feel the need to prohibit same-sex couples from getting the same benefits that traditional married couples receive?  Ridiculous.    Last time I checked, the Constitution was a document that guarantees rights to the citizens of this country, not one which takes them away.    And what's the deal with members of the Congressional Black Caucus supporting this proposed amendment? It seems so uncomfortably ironic that while the Constitution was amended to eliminate the evil institution of slavery, members of the CBC are now supporting Santorum's proposed change which would guarantee that same-sex couples can never have equal rights.  The CBC members supporting this amendment are clearly showing their ties to religious doctrine instead of historical precedent and logic.  It is time once and for all to get the damn church out of government.  Nothing good has ever happened because of religion!

      I have long advocated (and mentioned in prior posts) a national service initiative - a   required   national service program. David Brooks parrots my idea in his column today:   My own instinct is that we need an ambitious national service program to demystify the military for the next generation of Americans. It also seems clear, looking at our history, that combat heroism is not an essential qualification for a wartime leader. It's much more important to have the political courage that Lincoln had and Kennedy celebrated. But don't listen to me. I never served.  Just because he is agreeing with me does not mean I like him. And he's not totally agreeing with me as he equates "service" with military duty. I do not - In fact, I think there are plenty of other ways to serve ranging from teaching to community design and construction.

      Not only is Kerry fighting the Republicans for the White House, he has to fight the media as well.  urlLink Krugman's  article today is brilliant and points out the right-wing bias of the cable media. I think everyone should boycott CNN (naturally, you all should be boycotting Fox as well, though my No Fox rule is frequently broken in my own home by a partner that shall remain nameless).  Make sure you bookmark these sites and promote the truth:   urlLink campaigndesk.org   urlLink mediamatters.org   urlLink dailyhowler.com   And instead of cable news, opt for PBS or CSPAN. Or, if you must, the broadcast networks.  Don't let yourself be hoodwinked!

      Perhaps that explains my lack of outrage the last few weeks. Speaking of the convention - what a great one it was. It's an absolute shame that nobody covered it in any meaningful way - except PBS. And while the PBS ratings spiked at about 3 million, those three million were probably already going to vote for Kerry.  Anyway, we spent a long time in lovely  urlLink Taylor, Michigan  yesterday afternoon waiting to see Senator Kerry  urlLink speak and play a little softball . The speech was almost identical to his acceptance speech in Boston, but considering many probably never heard or saw it, it went over well with the crowd.  Hard to believe that, in my world anyway, the campaign took on more importance than the Nomar blockbuster.
