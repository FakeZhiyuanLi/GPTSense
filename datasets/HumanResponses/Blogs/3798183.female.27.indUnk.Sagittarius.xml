      Tonight is my first entry. I have spent the night in downtown tasting the best Chicago has to offer as far as food is concerned. What a city this is. Full of diversity and creativity. But amongst the crowd, there are people that are hungry and alone. I saw a lady today in a light purple jumpsuit that had such a look of complete disarray. As I drove past her today, she noticed me noticing her. I saw her crack a smile. I connected with her on some remote level. Life is so interesting sometimes. It was such a good day. I love this city.

      I am back in Nashvegas working with other people and situations. I still have a coating on Chicago over my skin. This is really strange to me. I am affected by this city is such a negative way. When I went there I noticed that it took me a day to adjust spiritually and emotionally to this place. And yet, when I arrived back here I am still affected by this city. I am under spiritual attack and I am fully aware of it. I think that if I acknowledge it- it will someone how go away. Whoever reads this today, I pray that you would lift up the team there. It is thier week off and yet they are not able to rest and have peace. Pray that the coating I have on my skin will be diminshed and I will be able to fully be here in Nashville. The situations here are serious as well. I need you HOly SPirit to led and guide me today as I sift through what has happened and what should happen. Lead me.............

      here in the city- i am in complete sensory overload. as i sit here and type i hear cars, people screaming and the ring of just noise. i have had a million calls today. i am realizing that my life revolves around a cell phone and the internet. what happened here? but in the midst of the noise, i love city life. how can one person be so craving silence but yet love everything in which the city has to offer. i am looking forward to the silence of a plane i will take to west palm on saturday. life is very busy right now. i pray that God quiets my spirit and speaks to me. i really need to hear his stilling and calming voice. i am asking him specifically to show up in a tangible way during the next two days. a friend of mine has lost something. Father, i want so much for you to show up in the bushes very much like you did for moses. we believe you hear us. we want to see you here in this city. please intervene.

       It is so interesting what comes to the surface when you are completely honest with yourself and with others. As I have blogged earlier, the issue of trust has come to the surface. I have realized that because of my lacking of understanding about what God is doing in my life, I have allowed unbelief and distrust to saturate my life. This is not a place I have ever known. Through the simple fact of realization, I have begun the healing process. God, I desire to respond to you out of the intimate relationship I have with you not out of my flesh. I want so much to trust you with everything. I can not do this on my own.

       Even though today is sandwiched in the middle of a week-it is unique. My body, mind, and spirit are refreshed and rested. It is amazing how I savor the quietness of today. My mom is in town and is such a blessing to me. We are like bffs. I really don't know when this happened-but I am so glad it did.      I am looking forward to another weekend of spontanity. I just like to have nothing on my plate and it just turning out to be incredible. no plans until the minute of............... I am glad that some parts of life can be this way. It seems as if everything is already planned out. I know my upcoming months are....meetings, interviews, trips......      I am savoring today.

       What an oxymorn today is. It is August and it feels as if the crispness of the fall has somehow crept in. I do not think it is here to last but I welcome it with open arms. Fall is my favorite season. Leaves changing give such a beautiful picture of how sweet it is to die. I do not think that in any other situation does death look so beautiful. I am excited about a weekend of rest and reflection. I will breathe in the air and think through the past few months of craziness. I have enjoyed the people and places so much. What a wonderful job to ministry across the world and see the hand of God change lives. Do I really get paid to do this? I am blessed.      I really like life right now. I like the people in my life right now, I have a family that lives close enough to come visit. (I adore taking my nephew swimming) I am amazed that God uses me in a ministry that connects with students and provides a way for them to put flesh to their relationship with Christ. I live in a city that is familiar but yet full of exciting things to learn and do. I thank you Abba for continual guidance...........This was not what I would have chose but it is exactly where I am suppose to be.   You presence is my constant longing.

       august is in and things have actually slowed a bit down. i am so glad. it has been a worldwind of a summer with new experiences, boundaries and places to discover. i can look back as the hand of God was guiding throughout the summer. i am now processing everything that happened. some good, and some difficult and challenging. God has blessed me with a close inner circle that i can be completely real and transparent with. this is so important. i learned a very interesting fact about myself. self-discovery is always a good thing. through another person, i learned an interesting tidbit.   before seminary, i trusted everyone. completely. you had my trust until something happened to break it. now, i come into a relationship with people and things very distrusting. therefore, if you choose to enter my life now know that you have to earn my trust. how did i get like this? is it healthy and Christlike? Does God call us to be trusting or simply loving? i am asking God right now how i should be and knowing that only He can get me to where i need to be.
