      THE WORD: But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of this world to shame the strong; He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things - and the things that are not - to nullify the things that are. 1 Cor 1:27-28 WHAT DOES HE TELLS ME: Not to be proud of my own wisdom. My wisom is made foolish in the eyes of the Lord. My strength is made weak in the Lord and all that i am is nullified in the Lord. That i have to completely surrender to him and rely on his wisdom, strength and providence. Also this tells me that i am never wise in my worldly wisdom. If i think myself wise i will not be chosen by God. God will not use me. I need to consider myself foolish, weka and lowly for God to use me. For only then he displays his power in me. WHAT I SAY AND WHAT I SO: I will humble myself before the Lord. I will empty myself of all that i am and surrender to him. Ask him to provide me wisdom and strength and to raise me up. PRAYER: Father, thank you that you do not choose the wise the strong and the famous of this world otherwise i would have no place in your kingdom. Please continue to work in me to remove the things i consider myself wise and strong. Help me give up my all in you and surrender myself to your will. Help me look towards you for my daily sustenance. In Jesus name. Amen.

      THE WORD: For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1:18 WHAT HE TELLS ME: That the message of the cross is the power of God. If i am perishing then i dont belive the power of God and the gospel is foolishness to me. If i do not value the gospel, if i do not value jesus, if i do not value God's power i am perishing. The message of God elaborates and demonstrates the power of god. The death of Jesus is the demonstration of Gods power that he was able to reach into the kingdom of darkness and pull out my soul. It is a demonstration of Gods power that he is bigger than Satan and has power over Satan. If i doubt that God by letting Jesus die on the cross for my sin, is able to reach into the kingdom of darkness to save my soul and if it sounds foolish to me i am perishing.  WHAT I SAY AND WHAT I DO? As a saved person i need to value and treasure the message of the cross, which is the message of why Jesus died on the cross for me. I must realize that i am no longer a person who is living and going towards death. I will not perish beacause of the promise of salvation and eternal life. PRAYER: Father thank you for saving me and making me your son. I am thankful to Jesus for dying on the cross for me so that i can inherit eternal life and not perish. Help me esteem the value of Jesus death on the cross for me. I treasure the message of the cross which has given me a hope for eternity. Amen.

      THE WORD: Because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you. Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 1 Cor 1:6-7 WHAT HE TELLS ME: I do not lack any spiritual gifts WHAT I SAY AND I DO: To be confident of myself in God that i do not lack any spiritual gifts and to pray for my growing in spiritual gifts. That we do not lack any spiritual gifts is confirmed by the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives. So i should pray for the revelation of Jesus in my life. PRAYER: Father, i pray for the revelation of Jesus in my life for the release of spiritual gifts. Help me realize that i do not lack in any spiritual gifts. Give me the wisdom and understanding needed to use these gifts in my life and to help others. Amen.

      THE WORD: I always thanks God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. For in him you have been enriched in every way - in all your speaking and all your knowledge 1 Cor 1: 4-5 WHAT HE TELLS ME: To be thankful that God has given us much grace through his son Jesus Christ. Because of this grace we have been provided with all heavenly riches, the gifts of utterances and knowledge. Only through Jesus Christ we receive the grace and the heavanly riches. WHAT I SAY AND WHAT SHOULD I DO: Focus on Jesus Christ. Remember that i cannot approach God through my merits and only through Jesus Christ. I should stop trying to rely on my abilties and rest myself in him. I should be thankful to God that he has provided me much grace to approach him through his son. When i am in Jesus i will be blessed with all spirtual riches as promised in these words. PRAYER: Father help me to let go of my efforts trying to make myself correct with you. Let me rely on Jesus to receive the grace that you freely offer. Thank you that you are such a loving father and thank you for the grace that you offer me inspite of my faults. Help me to be in Jesus so that i may receive the blessings of the riches of heaven. Help me put my faith and efforts in stroring up riches in heaven. Amen.
