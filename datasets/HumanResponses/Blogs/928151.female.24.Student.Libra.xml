      tooo wierd.   Dear Sarah, here is your Horoscope for January 31, 2004  It is not necessary to smother your loved ones in order to let them know that they are loved today, Sarah. More than likely, they will appreciate your presence more if you simply give them some space to breathe. Step back a bit in order to give others the room they need to spread their wings. A slightly detached attitude is best since it will give you room to develop your own personality instead of being so reliant upon others.

       urlLink Match.com   About this report  We've customized this report based on your answers to the test. Some results will be very accurate while others may miss the mark.     Who You Are  You have a special zeal for life  You're a very balanced person. You have a talent for seeing beyond the details of day-to-day life. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way. Despite your natural charm, you can't pretend to care for someone if you're missing a deep connection. You're a secret romantic, even if you'd feel too silly to admit it. You're ready and able to experience romance and a powerful "spark" with someone special. Your biggest challenge may be finding time to connect given your busy (and often frantic) life.    What's dating all about to you?  You believe dating and life in general is about learning and growing as a person. You have a great skill for connecting with people, so dating comes relatively easily to you. However, it's hard for you to have a real intellectual connection with an attractive man. Hopefully, you've found a way to "go with the flow" in dating as you already do in other parts of your life.   You face two major challenges in finding the love of your life. First, because your mind is so busy making sure you say and do the right things on dates, it's hard for your deeper and caring self to come through. It feels risky to share this part of yourself. Second, although having a vision of what you want can be helpful, the risk is that your high standards can get in the way of loving a real-life imperfect man.    Here's how you compare with other women your age            How unique is your type?  Your personality profile is similar to a number of women your age. Looking at over 10,000 women who have taken the test, about 5% (or 1 in 20 women) have very similar beliefs, values, and habits. Of course, the way these qualities are expressed in you is what makes you so unique.   How many other women have personalities like you?    Quirks men notice  Like all women, you have your strengths as well as your quirks and shortcomings. Ultimately, you want to find someone who will love and accept you "warts and all." Though you have lots of friends, it's important to have at least one person in your life who understands.   You have a pretty even-tempered personality and may not have any especially annoying or quirky habits. Of course, seeming to be "perfect" could be seen as a flaw by some, in which case you may just want to pretend to have a bad habit!  Do men like your type?  Notice that 41% of men are generally attracted to your personality type. 3% say they are VERY attracted. With the millions of people on Match.com, that translates into lots of potential matches.   How many men are attracted to your type?       Who You're Looking For   He'll be an enigma  You're looking for a man who can be your soul mate AND playmate in life! He has a wide variety of interests and an insatiable curiosity about life. Though he has both close friends and a broader group of buddies to hang out with, he's also very independent. So it may be a little hard to get to know him, especially emotionally. But it's worth the effort! You'll never be bored, since he stays busy with outdoor activities, community involvement, and hobbies and will encourage you to be active too.   You don't expect your partner to be in a good mood all the time. You understand that sometimes your partner will be down, get pessimistic or worry too much. These days are balanced by the many good days the two of you will share. In fact, you share a number of positive qualities, including:    No strong similarities were detected, which suggests that you may be more attracted to certain "opposite qualities." Please read the next sections to see if you may be seeking someone with different or opposite qualities to balance your own habits and style.  Here's how you compare to your "ideal" partner           Number of men your type Men with the exact type of personality you prefer are rare gems. Looking at over 10,000 men who have taken this test, only 10% (or 1 in 10 men) have the exact combination of similarities and contrasts in personality you find extremely appealing.   However, there's a larger group, 34% (or 1 in 3 men), who have most, but not all, of the qualities and habits you like. These subgroups are charted below.   Approximately two-fifths of the men have at least some of the traits you find attractive.   But you'd have a negative reaction to 5% (or 1 in 20 men), who have some or many of the characteristics you clearly dislike.   How many men are your "ideal" type?    Finding someone like you  You want to share your life with someone who has the same values, goals, and style you have. Research has shown that couples who have more in common tend to stay together longer. The qualities you find attractive (and unattractive) in men suggest you would certainly be happier with a man who's more like you.   No very strong opposites were detected, which suggests that you are most attracted to men who are very similar to you. This is good news since similar couples tend to stay together longer.  Quirks you can tolerate  The truth is that everyone is potentially "high maintenance." We all have our quirks and shortcomings. The key to long-term harmony is finding a man who can tolerate (or maybe even enjoy) your "quirks," or the little personal oddities that make you unique. You seem okay with several common quirks that might come along with your "ideal" man:   You described a pretty balanced person as most attractive to you, so no strong quirks were noted. Watch out for quirks during dating, since they may indicate a strong quality that is hidden at first.  Downside of your "ideal"  In addition to his quirks, your "ideal" personality type may have other qualities that are more frustrating or challenging to deal with. Under stress, his quirks can become serious "flaws." But remember, these quirks are the "flip side of the coin," or the extreme end of qualities you otherwise find appealing. So, be prepared if:   Because you're most attracted to men with balanced personalities, no troubling differences were noted. Nevertheless, remember that too much similarity can lead to conflict as well, especially when problems call for very different perspectives or actions.  Deal breakers  You seem ready to adapt to the good and frustrating qualities of the men you're looking for, but there are types of men you clearly do NOT like. Men's habits and attitudes you'd have a hard time putting up with include:   Your responses suggest that you are pretty accepting and tolerant of shortcomings. No major personality "deal breakers" or reasons to rule out potential dates were identified.  Trade-offs you'll face  Good Qualities Challenging Qualities  Tries to balance spending time with a few close friends and going out with a big group of friends.  Given the demands of family, friends, and activities, it's hard to find time alone together.   Comes up with lots of great ideas about how to do things better or improve the world.  Creative ideas are often impractical or unrealistic.   Tries to balance an objective view of problems with compassion for the people and feelings involved.  Competing drives from your rational vs. compassionate points of view can stand in the way of making decisions.   Not afraid to make tough decisions and move ahead.  Jumps too quickly to make decisions, because waiting is so hard to do.      Sex  Romantic sex  Good sex is important to you, but it's only one of many ways you connect with your partner. To you, life is about finding balance, and a romantic and satisfying sex life is a key part of your vision.   Among women your age, your particular combination of sexual drive and interests is similar to about 1 in 10 women (10%).   Is he sexually compatible?  You're looking for someone just like you, who values the quality of sex over the quantity. You want someone who would never pressure you about sex.   What's ahead for you sexually?  A good sexual match plays a key role in your "ideal" relationship. If you can bring your natural creativity and imagination to the bedroom, your sex life will never be boring. It may be so good and seem so natural that you'll be shocked when sexual miscommunication or lack of interest occurs. You're prone to worry and read a lot into situations. Don't panic! You're very intuitive, so you're especially sensitive to bumps in the road. Fortunately, you also bring good problem solving skills and rational thinking to the relationship. A good man will understand your need for reassurance and may be willing to meet you half way sexually.   How you and your "ideal" partner compare         Attraction Science  What is personality? Personality is the set of traits and characteristics that make each of us unique yet relatively stable and consistent over time.  - People see and interpret the world differently. - They want different things. - They make decisions differently. - They get excited and energized by different situations. - They structure their careers, social life, and private time in different ways.  What does personality have to do with attraction? The way in which people are similar or different in personality strongly affects their attraction to one another. Two people with similar values are more likely to become (and stay) friends or a couple, indeed part of compatibility is having "common ground." However, for many people, compatibility may also involve a balance between each other's quirks and differences.   Where did the test come from? The test you just took is the most scientifically grounded and customized personality assessment on the Internet. It's a "smart" test because it can tailor specific questions to you based on your earlier choices so no one gets exactly the same questions. The content of the tests and the game-like way the choices were presented are the result of over 15 years of research by the scientists at weAttract.com, Inc.

       urlLink Match.com: Millions of possibilities to meet your match : Top 12 ways you sabotage your love life  Dr. John Gray, MarsVenus.com  Nearly all of us have bounced back from bad breakups or decided to date again after a death or divorce. Reentering the dating scene is just a natural part of growing into our emotional maturity.   Some of us, however, make recovering our love lives much harder than it should be. We run after romance because we think we should, and not because we're ready.   Sound familiar? Here's a list of a dozen other ways you can potentially sabotage your starting-over process.   1. Being too picky  While it's important to make sure that your potential partner shares your values, don't make your checklist of desirable qualities too long. Becoming overly protective of your heart may make you overly judgmental, ultimately disqualifying quality suitors.   2. Associating dating with sex  Because she worries that she'll be pressured into intimacy, a woman is likely to avoid the situation completely. Pearl of wisdom: Date around, don't sleep around. Avoid the fear of getting hurt by saying no to sex, not to dating.   3. Glorifying the past  Quit comparing each new romantic opportunity to someone in your past. Your past partner wasn't perfect; otherwise, you'd still be together.   4. Grieving, grieving… and grieving some more  It's healthy to mourn the loss of relationship. But holding onto your pain too long only keeps you safe — and alone.   5. Not giving ourselves permission to love again  When your partner's passed away, opening yourself to the possibility of happiness may feel like you're betraying a sacred trust. You eventually have to recognize, though, that letting go does not make you stop loving him or her; instead, it frees you from your grief so you're finally able to feel the love again.   6. Sleeping around  You may try to fill the void left by a breakup by seeking fleeting intimacy outside yourself. Remind yourself that you're merely repairing low self-esteem caused by rejection or lack of affection.   7. Expecting immediate passion  If you're expecting the earth to shake as soon as you meet someone, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. In fact, a red flag should wave when if you do feel intense attraction right away. You could be responding to your idea of what someone's like — not the reality.   8. Maintaining unrealistic expectations or over-romanticizing  Thanks to box office moneymakers and randy romance novels, you might get the idea that your true love will come knocking at your door. The truth is you need to be an active participant in making your dreams come true.   9. Attracting the wrong type  Holding on to unresolved hurt from past relationships? Bad idea: You'll only attracts people to repeat the pattern.   10. Focusing on the negative  By floundering in negative feelings and pondering the pain of past relationships, you can convince yourself not to bother trying again.   11. Becoming overly self-sufficient  When you start sending out the message that you don't need anyone in your life, you sabotaging your ability to attract a match. Having needs is not the same as being needy.   12. Taking on too much  Losing yourself in taking care of others and putting the needs of your family before your own are additional ways you can close off availability.   Getting started is the most important part of starting over. Move forward with careful thought and understanding of what you need. Realize that the mistakes and losses of the past are actually badges of wisdom to carry into your new life.   Search for local singles today. Make a date for the weekend!

       urlLink Representations of Kingship in Shakespeare's Second Tetralogy : REPRESENTATIONS OF KINGSHIP AND POWER IN SHAKESPEARE’S SECOND TETRALOGY OF HISTORY PLAYS   Amanda Mabillard  Since it is impossible to know Shakespeare’s attitudes, beliefs, and play writing methodology, we can only present hypotheses, based upon textual evidence, regarding his authorial intention and the underlying didactic message found in the second tetralogy of history plays. In constructing his history plays, Shakespeare most likely relied upon the chronicles of Froissart, and, primarily, Holinshed, but he altered and embellished the material found in these sources. Through an examination of both the plays and Shakespeare’s sources, we see that many of the changes are implemented to promote the following political philosophy found in the plays. The plays make the statement that the best possible ruler must be both anointed and politically shrewd. A monarch’s license to rule is not based simply on his or her divine right of succession, but also on his or her ability to shoulder the responsibility that comes with being divinely appointed – to lead the people wisely, placing the welfare of the nation above personal desire. This philosophy seems to be a combination of Tudor and Machiavellian theories on the nature of kingship and power. Moreover, it is possible that this didactic message linking all four history plays in the second tetralogy was constructed as a reaction to the succession problem and the potentiality that Elizabeth and her council might choose an heir lacking in one or both of these areas. Thus, the plays, to a large extent, can be read as a collective guide to help Elizabeth select the next ruler of England.   In order to assess the credibility of the argument that the plays contain the didactic message that a ruler needs the combination of divine right and leadership qualities, we must examine the three main characters, Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V, as found in the chronicles and in the plays.   Overall, the Richard II found in Shakespeare’s play differs little from the Richard in the histories of Holinshed and Froissart. The historical events of Richard’s reign are kept in sequence and no significant changes are made to his character. However, it is the small and subtle changes to the chronicles that so effectively reshape the focus of the play from a simple report on history, to a dramatic lesson on the responsibilities of monarchs.  Many of the embellishments Shakespeare makes to the information he found in Holinshed’s Chronicles are directed towards stressing and reaffirming Richard’s status as a divinely sanctioned king. The first and most striking example is the way the character of Gaunt changes. Shakespeare’s portrayal of Gaunt is one of the few instances where he dramatically alters the source material of Holinshed1 . In the Chronicles, Gaunt is a disorderly and rapacious magnate. However, in Richard II, Gaunt is the voice of reason, wisdom, and, above all, patriotism. It is likely that Shakespeare relied on the Chronicle of Froissart for his characterization of Gaunt. The following passage from Froissart’s Chronicle shows the similarities:   The duke of Lancastre was sore dyspleased in his mind to se the kynge his nephewe mysse use himselfe in dyvers thynges as he dyd. He consydred the tyme to come lyke a sage prince, and somtyme sayd to suche as he trusted best: Our nephue the kynge of Englande wyll shame all or he cease: he beleveth to lyghtly yvell counsayle who shall distroy hym; and symply, if he lyve longe, he wyll lese his realme, and that hath been goten with moche coste and travayle by our predecessours and by us; he suffreth to engendre in the realme bytwene the noble men hate and dyscorde, by whom he shulde be served and honoured, and this lande kept and douted . . . The Frenchman are right subtyle; for one myschiefe that falleth amonge us, they wolde it were ten, for otherwise they canne nat recover their dommages, nor come to their ententes, but by our owne means and dyscorde betwene ourselfe. And we se dayly that all realmes devyded are destroyed; . . . in lykewise amonge ourselfe, without God provyde for us, we shall destroy ourselfe; the apparaunce therof sheweth greatly. (John Froissart, Chronicles [London:, Macmillan, 1899], vi, 335-36).   "So also we are told by Froissart that Gaunt did not attempt to avenge the murder of his brother the Duke of Gloucester, but ‘wisely and amiably he appeased all these matters’. . ." (Peter Ure, ed. Richard II [London: 1956], p.xxxiv). In these passages from Froissart is a Gaunt who greatly resembles Shakespeare’s character, but Shakespeare further enhances Gaunt’s patriotism and loyalty to the king in order to place the emphasis on Richard’s divine right to rule. In many of his speeches in the play, Gaunt emphatically expounds the importance of the Divine Right of Kings. The first of these speeches comes at the beginning of Act II, as Gaunt speaks with the Duchess of Gloucester. Gaunt knows Richard was an accomplice in the murder of Gloucester, but still he refuses to support any action that would put Richard’s crown at risk:  Gaunt. . . . To stir against the butchers of his life!  But since correction lieth in those hands  Which made the fault that we cannot correct,  Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven . . .( I, ii, 3-6)  God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,   His deputy anointed in His sight,  Hath caused his death; the which is wrongfully,  Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift  An angry arm against His minister. (I, ii, 37-41)   Protecting Richard’s position as God’s vicegerent is extremely important to Gaunt. For whatever crimes Richard has committed, it is the responsibility of God alone, not Richard’s subjects, to judge and punish him for his offenses. Gaunt’s condemnation of disobedience to Richard because of Richard’s divine right to the crown exemplifies the Tudor political thought of the sixteenth century. The Tudors adopted the theory of the Divine Right of Kings in the attempt to maintain a strong government, and to counter the Papal authority as the state attempted to break away from the church. The theory became the foremost doctrine of the time regarding the nature of kingship, and rests on four main statements: (1) Monarchy is a divinely ordained institution. (2) Heredity right is indefeasible . The right acquired by birth to rule must not be forfeited through any acts of usurpation. (3) Kings are accountable to God alone. (4) Non-resistance and passive obedience are enjoined by God. Under any circumstances resistance to a king is a sin, and ensures damnation. (John Neville Figgis, The Divine Right of Kings, [London: 1923], p.8). The vehicles for the expression of Tudor propaganda were usually homilies and sermons. For example, in 1547, under Edward VI, a collection of homilies was produced that included An Exhortation concerning Good Order and Obedience to Rulers and Magistrates. It declares the following:  It is intolerable ignorance, madness, and wickedness for subjects to make any murmuring, rebellion or insurrection against their most dear and most dread sovereign Lord and King, ordained and appointed by God’s goodness for their commodity, peace, and quietness.(As quoted in B.L. Joseph, Shakespeare’s Eden [London: 1971], p.176)  Turning our attention once again to Richard II, we see that Gaunt’s words to the Duchess of Gloucester match the sentiment found in the following excerpt from a sermon by Hugh Latimer, the famed Bishop of Worcester, written in 1551:   God hath sent us a noble king in this his visitation; let us not provoke against him. Let us beware; let us not displease him; let us receive with all obedience and prayer the word of God. . . .I hear say ye walk inordinately, ye talk unseemly, otherwise it becometh Christian subjects: yea take upon you to judge the judgments of judges. I will not make the king a pope; for the pope will have all things that he doth taken for an article of our faith. I will not say but the king and his council may err; I pray daily that they may not err. It becometh us, whatsoever they decree, to stand unto it, and receive it obediently. . . . (Hugh Latimer, Sermons [Cambridge: 1950], p.148)  Gaunt’s speeches in Act II, scene i, are (as any theater-patron at the time would recognize) foreshadowing the actions of Bolingbroke and the suffering that will occur as a result. Bolingbroke will make countless other English men and women feel the repercussions of his act of deposing the rightful King Richard.   Gaunt’s transformation from Holinshed’s greedy aristocrat who cares little for the commonwealth into Shakespeare’s patriotic voice of Tudor England is the most significant example of Shakespeare’s additions and alterations implemented to stress the importance of Richard’s ordained right to rule. However, there are other additions in the drama that also work to this end. In Holinshed’s Chronicle, it is reported that York is left in charge while Richard is in Ireland, and that he raises a small army to confront Bolingbroke and his men. But it is in vain because York’s army refuses to fight against the beloved Bolingbroke. York then "came foorth into the church that stood without the castell, and there communed with the duke of Lancaster"(Holinshed, Chronicles [New York: AMS Press,1965], p.102), and he listed as one among the many who came "flocking unto him eueire part."(Chronicles, p. 102). York’s feelings are ambiguous in this passage. He clearly obeys his orders and tries to fight Bolingbroke, but he seems to change sides and join Bolingbroke without compunction or hostility. In Richard II, however, York’s dislike of Bolingbroke’s actions is clear:   York. Tut, tut! Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle!  I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word ‘grace’  In an ungracious mouth is but profane. . . .  Coms’t thou because the anointed king is hence.. .  York, in the play, is outraged that Bolingbroke would consider rebelling against Richard. His speech draws attention to Richard’s anointed status. Having no choice, York goes along with Bolingbroke, but he is bitter: "It may be I go with you./But yet I’ll pause/For I am loath to break our country’s laws."(II.iii.166-168).   Another addition Shakespeare’s makes to the drama not found in the sources is a speech given by Richard. Richard’s brief initial confidence before Salisbury brings the news that his men have joined Bolingbroke is mention briefly in Holinshed. However, the speech Richard gives is created by Shakespeare, and further illustrates Richard’s divine right:   [Bolingbroke’s] treasons will sit blushing on his face,  Not able to endure the sight of day,  But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.  Not all the water in the rough rude sea  Can wash the balm off from an anointed king.(III. ii. 51-55)  It is obvious that all of the additions Shakespeare makes to his play, discussed so far, are primarily intended to show how terrible the crime of rebellion is against a legitimate ruler. But the additions also illustrate the importance of legitimacy itself. Richard has gained the throne by the law of primogeniture, and has license to control England because he is a divinely-ordained king. Although Richard, as we will see, is grossly incompetent at managing the affairs of the realm, he is legitimate; he has right on his side, and, therefore, he has one of the qualifications that make a successful ruler.   What Richard is lacking is the ability to make shrewd political decisions. He is ordained and has the rightful authority and obligation to lead his subjects, but, being weak and self-absorbed, he cannot fulfill his duty. His ineffectiveness is shown in the Chronicles, of Holinshed, but to a far lesser extent than in the play. Many additions Shakespeare makes to Richard II are designed to emphasize Richard’s divine right, but so too are many passages added that bring to light Richard’s flaws in the area of governance. Subsequently, the additions illustrate that Richard is not the best possible ruler because he does not have the combination of legitimacy and political savvy.   In the Chronicles, Holinshed reports that Richard II banishes Bolingbroke because Bolingbroke cannot solve his quarrel with Mowbray peacefully. It seems a necessary decision in the Chronicles – Richard desires to end the argument, and no other motive of Richard is implied. But in the play, Richard makes the following speech after Bolingbroke is banished that impugns his motives behind the removal of Bolingbroke:   He is our cousin, cousin; but ‘tis   doubt,  When time shall call him home from banishment,  Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.  Ourself and Bushy here, Bagot and Green,  Observ’d his courtship to the common people—  How he did seem to dive into their hearts  With humble and familiar courtesy; . . .   As were our England in reversion his,   And he our subjects’ next degree in hope. (I.iv.19-36)   It is apparent that Richard’s motivation in the play for banishing Bolingbroke is jealousy. Although severely punishing a man so beloved by the people for a minor offense is political folly, Richard does not seem to take this into consideration. He shows his weakness as a ruler by allowing his emotions to shape his decisions. This passage also illustrates that Richard has not been able to interact effectively with the English people; he has done nothing to gain their support. This estrangement from the common people is politically disastrous. The necessity of having the support of the common people is the basis of several chapters in Machiavelli’s The Prince (Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince [New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1988], Ch. VIII-XV). In both the play and the Prince we see that the ability to influence public opinion is the key to political success, a concept that Richard cannot grasp.   Holinshed’s Chronicles recount how Richard had to ‘farme the realm’ and impose blank charters on the people as a source of revenue: "And the charters were sent abroad into all shires of the realme, whereby great grudge and murmuring arose among the people . . ."(Holinshed, p. 90). Holinshed does not say for what purpose Richard used the money. Shakespeare, however, adds the following passage:   Richard. We will ourself in person to this war;  And, for our coffers, with too great a court,  . . .We are enforc’d to farme our royal realme,  The revenue whereof shall furnish us  Our affairs in hand. If that come short,  Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters . . .(I, iv, 41-48)    To take the money of his already poverty-stricken subjects and use it to finance the war in Ireland is a politically-disastrous decision.2 Machiavelli writes that confiscating the property of his subjects frivolously is the worst mistake a ruler can make(Machiavelli, p. 64). It is likely no coincidence that Shakespeare chooses to emphasize Richard’s use of the money for a cause so unacceptable to the people.  Richard’s lack of political ability is also the basis for the inclusion of a speech by York in the play. In Holinshed’s Chronicles, it is reported that York was displeased with Richard, but the reason why he was displeased are not given. In Richard II however, Shakespeare’s provides us with this information, giving a detailed account of Richard’s faults:   York. [Richard’s ear] is stopp’d with other flattering sounds,  As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,  Lascivious meters, to whose venom sound  The open ear of youth doth always listen—  Report of fashions in proud Italy,  Whose manners still our tardy apish nation  Limps after in base imitation. . . .  . . . there’s no respect how vile—  That is not quickly buzz’d into his ears.(II.i.17-30)   A few lines later, Gaunt reaffirms this description of the effeminate king:   . . . Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land,  Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;  . . . A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,  Whose compass is no bigger then thy head . . .  O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye  Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,  From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,  Deposing thee before thou wert possess’d. . . .(II.i.93-107)    It is possible that these speeches were added by Shakespeare for purely dramatic purposes, but, more plausibly, the lines spoken by York and Gaunt were inserted to illuminate the political foibles of Richard, a ruler led by self-serving flatterers, and more concerned with fashion than public opinion or the good of the realm. These passages echo the words of Machiavelli:  What will make [the ruler] despised is being considered inconstant, frivolous, effeminate, pusillanimous, and irresolute: a ruler must avoid contempt as if it were a reef. He should contrive that his actions should display grandeur, courage, seriousness and strength . . . A ruler who succeeds in creating such an image of himself will enjoy a fine reputation; and it will be difficult to plot against him or to attack him. . . A ruler will effectively protect himself from this danger if he avoids incurring hatred and contempt, and keeps the people satisfied with him. It is essential to do this . ..(Machiavelli, p.64).   Richard believes that his status as anointed king is the only attribute he needs to govern successfully, and so he makes no effort to display those traits that both the Prince and the play deem vital. Through greed, complacency, and naiveté, Richard loses the support of the populous and incurs their contempt, and subsequently, leaves himself vulnerable to plots and attacks.   In Holinshed’s Chronicles, Richard steals Bolingbroke’s property, and Holinshed mentions that "this hard dealing was much disliked by all the nobilitie, and cried out against of the meaner sort; but namelie the duke of York was therewith sore mooued . . ." (Holinshed, p. 102). Shakespeare, however, embellishes what is found in the Chronicles and creates a speech by York designed to forewarn Richard that his decision to confiscate Bolingbroke’s land will have dire consequences:  York: . . .If you do wrongfully seize Herford’s rights,  Call in the letter-patents that he hath  By his attorneys general to sue  His livery, and deny his off’red homage,  You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,  You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts. . .(II.i.200-206)   Richard rejects York’s warning and superciliously replies:   Think what you will, we seize into our hands  His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands (II,i, 208-210)   Once again, Shakespeare adds passages not found in any of his sources; passages befitting the didactic purpose of the play, intended to illustrate Richard’s political mistakes and his lack of concern for governing properly. York’s warning is a reiteration of Machiavellian doctrine: "What will make [the ruler] hated, above all else, is being rapacious and seizing the property. . .of his subjects"(Machiavelli, p.64). According to Machiavelli, above all else, the confiscation of property is the worst action a ruler can take. Richard, playing perfectly the role of an incompetent ruler, does not even give it a second thought3 .   By Richard’s insistence that he need do nothing for the good of the nation except sit on his divinely-appointed throne, he has committed the crime of gross negligence against his subjects. The effect Richard’s behavior has on the country is evident in the garden scene, unique to Shakespeare’s play:   Servant: Why should we in the compass of a pale  Keep law and form and due proportion,  Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,  When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,  Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok’d up,  Her fruit trees all unprun’d, and her hedges ruin’d,  Her knots disorder’d, and her wholesome herbs  Swarming with caterpillars. (40-46)   In this extended metaphor for England, we see that just as a garden must be tended continually with loving care by the gardener if it is to grow and bear fruit, so must the country be tended by its ruler to ensure it functions properly. Thus, this passage captures both the central moral message of the play, and the deep sadness that Richard’s subjects feel as he allows his England to deteriorate. The servants, in keeping with the play’s message that the deposition of a king is always wrong, do not condone the usurpation by any means – they simply wish things had been different:  Gardner: . . . Bolingbroke  Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it  That he had not so trimm’d and dress’d his land  As we this garden! We at time of year  Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,  Lest, being overproud in sap and blood,   With too much riches it confound itself.  Had he done so to great and growing men,  They might have liv’d to bear and he to taste  Their fruits of duty.(III.iv.53-63)  The only recourse for the Gardner and Servant is to ponder how life would be different if Richard had put the needs of the people before his own. Richard’s selfishness and lack of Machiavellian political sophistication have thrown the country into crisis, and will cost him his own life. Thus, we see that Shakespeare’s changes serve to illustrate both the importance of Richard’s status as an anointed king, and the disastrous consequences that result from his inability to make shrewd political decisions. Richard has only one of the facets that makes a successful ruler.

The two extended emblematic passages concerning proper governance of a state in the Richard II-Henry V tetralogy, i.e., the garden-allegory in Richard II (III.iv) and the beehive emblem in Henry V (I.ii.187-206), may derive from Shakespeare's knowledge of Mum and the Sothsegger, which contains a passage about an allegorical garden, followed immediately by a description of a beehive as figure for a perfect state (lines 976-81, 999-1009). Richard the Redeless and Mum were both apparently in the possession of the noted antiquary Nicholas Brigham, whose library Shakespeare may have used. Bale considered the two fragments one poem, as did the fifteenth-century cataloguer who wrote 'The lyff off kyng Rychard the ij' on Mum, even though that fragment, unlike Richard the Redeless, makes no allusion to that monarch."

       urlLink Richard II: Commentary (4) : The "Garden" Scene I want to jump ahead in the play for a moment to look at two other scenes that are especially important in looking at the issue of order and good government.  The garden scene (3. 4) is especially interesting in that it is so isolated from the general drive of the plot. In Romeo and Juliet you will remember that plot is not always Shakespeare's priority--there is always time for a lyrical aria like Mercutio's, or a comic scene that does not advance the plot. But so far in Richard II each scene has advanced the plot in a material way. The gardeners appear only in this scene, and even the Queen is a minor character (we will discuss Shakespeare's marginal women characters in the next module).     Why introduce the gardeners at this point?    The scene is clearly emblematic: the garden is treated by the gardeners (and hence the audience) as an extended metaphor for the state of England. [Note 3]  Read through the scene, and note the careful comparison the gardeners make between the cultivation of the plants under their care, and the need for good government to discipline the ambitious in order for the state to be fruitful and healthy.     What effect does the "rustic" accent of the actors have on your response?      Is the scene intended in part to be comic?      Or are the gardeners choric figures, voicing the response of the audience, and even of the play as a whole?      An Elizabethan garden. The use of symetrical "knots" makes the image of a garden more symbolic of order than a modern garden. From Thomas Hill, A Most Frief and Pleasant Treatise, Teaching How to Dress, Sow, and Set a Garden (1577).   The Queen sees the gardener as "Adam's likeness" (3. 4. 73), making again the parallel between England before the fall of Richard and Eden before the Fall.    Do you see her as a figure simply of pathos, self-pity, even, or a figure of anger, of strength?    England itself has been figured as female in the play.

       urlLink RII: The Garden Scene    KING RICHARD II: THE GARDEN SCENE (ACT III, SCENE IV)  The Garden Scene in Richard II is an important and pivotal moment in the play, fulfilling a variety of textual and dramatic requirements for both reader and audience. I personally found this scene to be one of my favorites, and when I examined just why I enjoyed it so much, I discovered that it had worked on me on a number of different levels, providing plot update, allegory, exposition, and character contrasts.   The first question to ask oneself in analyzing a scene, any scene, in Shakespeare, is "Why is it there?" What does it contribute to the overall flow and development of the play? Has it been inserted for purely practical, stage-oriented concerns? In the case of the Garden Scene, I see a number of things happening. Firstly, it occurs between two scenes in which Richard, Bolingbroke, and others are present, but between which some time has passed. This implies a costume change, and this little scene provides just such an opportunity. But this is far from the full measure of the scene's worth. In addition to its practical necessity, it also provides a much-needed respite from the increasingly mounting tension of the play; we are allowed to dally for a moment in the royal gardens before being thrust back into the action. We observe, for the better part of the scene, two humble gardeners, welcome company after three acts of nothing but kings and queens, lords and ladies, dukes and duchesses; particulary for any groundlings watching the play back in 1597, this was a pause in which to reflect and relate.   The gardeners in the scene provide not only menial services such as binding up the royal "apricocks," but are in fact far more valuable to the audience in their roles of, as it were, allegorical troubadours, offering a colorful and effective update to the plot thus far. This is made all the more delightful in that such high-flown metaphorical speech is unexpected; the queen has already announced to her ladies in waiting that the two men are sure to "talk of state, for everyone doth so/Against a change," (27-28) but our expectation, if we are not familiar with the play, is to hear some low, prosaic talk of politics from the point of view of the common man. Perhaps it was the convention in Shakespeare's day for menials in the service of the crown not to talk plainly about affairs of state, to shade their meanings in codes and circumlocution; in any case, the use of garden metaphors to describe recent events in the kingdom winds up being more effective, in a dramatic sense, than would be the case if the gardeners had engaged in casual conversation.   The first metaphorical reference is to the apricocks, which I took to refer to Richard himself, while the tree symbolizes England. His handling of the kingdom has caused it to "Stoop with oppression of their [his] prodigal weight." (31) Next, the main gardener instructs his man, "Go thou, and like an executioner/Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,/That look too lofty in our commonwealth:/All must be even in our government." (33-36) Here we see the first blatant reference to the state. These lines, at first glance, might seem to continue to refer to Richard, to his impending doom, yet the last line reveals that it is, in fact, the first of many references to the king's favorites, the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, and Greene. The gardener continues to speak of these three, shifting his allegory from sprays, shoots of plants or flowers, to outright weeds. Here the image changes from unruly flowers sprouting up beyond their uniformly growing neighbors, to rank weeds, growing out of control and damaging the surrounding soil.   The gardener's man replies with a rather lengthy, eight-line question, basically inquiring why the two men should bother with such labor when the whole kingdom, "our sea-walled garden" as he says, is "full of weeds," "chok'd up," "unprun'd," "ruin'd," "disordered," and "swarming with caterpillars?" (40-47) He seems to have picked up the gardening analogy and run with it, using it to its utmost potential to rail against the deplorable state of affairs in his country. His use of the term "sea-walled" echoes Gaunt's speech in Act II Scene I, in which that hoary nobleman refers to "the silver sea/Which serves it [England] in the office of a wall." (45-46)   At this point, the gardener tells his assistant to "Hold thy peace--"(48) and returns to further contemplations of Richard. This time, in the gardener's reflections, Richard has become a tree himself, but a tree which has not only suffered a "disordered spring," but is now encountering the "fall of leaf." (48-49) These seasonal allusions illustrate the gardener's mentality, as well as point to Richard's misspent tenure as king and his current, autumnal hour of rule; winter and death are not far off.   Next, the gardener resumes his previous weed analogy and links it to that of the tree. He speaks of the weeds "That seemed in eating him [Richard] to hold him up," (51) and then proceeds to name said weeds, i.e. Wiltshire, Bushy, and Greene, as well as Bolingbroke, whom he goes on to make the gardener in his metaphoric scenario. This last bit doesn't quite work, for it portrays Bolingbroke as a gardener that would thoughtfully pull up weeds damaging a precious tree, only to chop down the tree itself! In addition, for the remainder of his speech, the tree metaphor tends to shift from symbolizing Richard to symbolizing Richard's court. The parallel is drawn between the pruning of "superfluous branches" (63) and the need to rule, not indulge, unworthy members of the royal entourage.   It is here that the queen, hitherto concealed, springs forth to question the gardeners more closely regarding the alarming news which she has overheard. The gardener tells her more plainly of what he knows of recent events, she laments for a bit and finally exits. The last thing she says to the gardener before departing is "for telling me these news of woe,/Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow," meaning, I suppose, that his forebodings should never come to fruition.   It is interesting to note that the gardener seems to know more about what is happening in the kingdom that the queen herself. It is my suspicion that the historical Isabel would have been kept appraised of everything that everyone did or said pertaining to herself and her husband. Medieval rulers were far more shrewd than what we are led to believe, and it seems to me that Shakespeare portrayed her as ignorant to achieve a certain dramatic dynamic.   The last speech of the scene is the gardener's, in which he plants "a bank of rue, sour herb of grace." (105) He plants the rue on the spot where one of the queen's tears has fallen, thus supplying the final gardening metaphor of the scene. The quibble on "rue" is the link between nature and the queen's sorrow.   There are, to be sure, many other points in the play in which metaphor is employed, but no scene where it is put to such potent and poignant use. The continual use of nature imagery is the key to the impact of this scene; it is significant as a symbol to contemporary audiences, but it was even more so to those who went to see the play in Elizabethan times. Nature was so much more a facet of the lives of English men and women 400 years ago, it held a sense of wholeness and order. Shakespeare often linked the violation of order within the realm of kings and kingdoms with a congruent dissolution of order in nature. In the Garden Scene, while no horses turn and eat one another, no hurricanoes blow, yet the basic concept of an interconnectedness between mankind and nature is deftly and effectively utilized.   The Garden Scene is Shakespeare at his metaphorical best, a deceptively simple little scene which yields so much more than simply an opportunity for a costume change. It provides perspective on the cyclical nature of the machinations of man.

But mostly, Shakespeare gives the Gardener an opportunity to expand the idea of England as a "blessed plot" or garden. A close study of all the imagery in the scene should be made, but some ideas can be noted here. When the Gardener instructs the Servant in his task, we may already note the ambiguity of his orders: he likens the ripe fruit to "unruly children", while the servant is to be the "executioner" (we know that Bushy, Green and Wiltshire have just been executed by Bolingbroke's servants). The garden is a "commonwealth" in the Gardener's "government" and the weeds are "without profit" in sucking fertility from the flowers. In case we miss the point, the Servant now spells out the analogy: Richard has neglected his "sea-wallèd garden".  Back to top This gives the Gardener, continuing the Servant's metaphor, the chance to explain that the garden is now being tended by Bolingbroke: Richard is likened to a tree sheltering parasitic weeds which "seemed in eating him to hold him up"; the image is developed as the Gardener likens Richard's nobles to the boughs of a fruit tree: these need regular pruning (cutting back) while in extreme cases, "superfluous branches" (useless or disloyal nobles) are lopped away. Hearing this provokes the queen to join the conversation rebuking the Gardener who in "Adam's likeness" describes the expulsion from Eden of "cursèd man" in the person of Richard. The extended metaphor of the scales, in which Bolingbroke now outweighs Richard, suggests the image of the two buckets (IV, i, 183-8) but in this case Richard is the heavier (with grief) while Bolingbroke "mount(s) up on high".

Everyone needs room to move and express themselves, and by removing any mental projections of them, you will help them to be more authentically themselves.     --- Love Horoscope     Sun Sign: Libra   January 26, 2004 Email to a friend         Today|Tomorrow|This Week|This Month            The first two weeks of the month is when you will feel strongest in the game of love and romance. This is the time when you are feeling like you are holding the most valuable cards. Actions will speak louder than words, from January 1 through January 7. After that time, make sure that you mean what you say before you say it. Your words will mean more to others than you may realize. January 15 through January 21 marks a bit of a low point for you. This is a time to turn inward. The pace of your love life will pick up after January 21.     ---------- Chinese Compatibility     You: Goat  Your partner: Horse      Two perfectionists, united in concentration, make this relationship succeed. You make the exciting mutual discovery that your cool exteriors mask dynamic passion. As a couple, you may rarely disagree, but when you do, words are intellectual, but the criticisms can get out of hand. Your work with checklists and budgets ensure financial success, because little slips through the cracks. And, you are over-achievers.

        Aries & Libra    Two signs which naturally attract and complement each other. Tactful Libra tones down the Ram's fury, and redirects his or her individualism towards a partnership whose logical conclusion is the marriage which matters so much to Libra. The Libran harvests the Ram's vigor, but is sometimes rebuffed by blunt language. Aries must be careful to give Libra time to express him or herself. Otherwise, the magnetism which attracts them may turn into mutual repulsion.

      Find Your Sun Sign Profile     Libra    Charming Libra - the seventh sign of the zodiac. Libra stands for harmony, fairness, equality, and balance. You are considered to be the most civilized and polite member of the zodiac, because you always display an even-tempered and composed attitude.   Your ruler Venus - the planet of love, sex, and beauty - influences you to strive to create harmony, to express and show affection, and to accommodate and please others. Its romantic, sensual, and seductive energy makes you a suave and relationship-oriented person.   Libra is the second of the air signs, giving you the ability to stand back and look impartially at all matters, always seeing and considering both sides before arriving at a decision. You are sociable, tactful, and have great empathy for others, which makes you a much sought-after mate, especially since you are so refreshingly energetic, loving, and honest.   Your sign rules the seventh house of the horoscope, the sector associated with other people who act as your mirror. Therefore, it describes the nature of your relationships, both business and personal, as well as your experiences with marriage and partnerships.   Your sign's mode is cardinal, meaning that you actively try to improve and work on your relationships by reaching out, making compromises, and inspiring trust in them.   Your strengths, dear Libra, lie in your diplomatic approach to dealing with others. Your strong sense of fairness makes you the perfect mediator and peacemaker, because you always manage to stay objective and consider all points of view before making a decision.   But even you have weaknesses, dear charming Libra! For example, you can be frivolous and decadent, and place value on the superficial. Sometimes, especially when you are indecisive, you can be vague, shallow, and insincere. In certain situations, you are tempted to define "fairness" to your own advantage.    -----------------------------  Find Your Sun Sign Profile     Aries    Dear Aries your sign is that of energetic Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, the sign that is associated with Spring, and the symbol of rebirth and all beginnings.   Mars, the planet of action, is the ruler of your sign, and provides you with an extra portion of activity, assertiveness, and willpower. This makes you the fighter and the pioneer of the zodiac, who faces challenges with courage and bravery. If you do something you do it with passion and determination! If something bores you, you quickly move on to more interesting things.   You are the first of the three fire signs, an ambitious and charismatic individual, cheerful and enthusiastic in your undertakings. Others see you as outgoing and self-confident, and like to be around you.   As an Aries, you rule the first house, the section in the chart wheel that describes the outward behavior of a person, the disposition, appearance, manners, and the sense of self.   You are a cardinal sign, which means that you don't wait around until others take action. In other words, you initiate action immediately, forcefully, and directly.   Your strengths lie in your qualities as a leader; you inspire and motivate others with your enthusiasm, honesty, and straightforwardness. Since you are competitive, you need challenges like others need air to breathe. You are known for pushing any obstacles out of the way, and trust your instinctive nature. Your independence and power allow you to achieve your goals easily.   However, you have your share of weaknesses, too; for example, you can be impatient, and run the risk of acting too impulsively. At times, you can be self-centered, and tend to overlook that others might have a different point of view. When they do, you can become stubborn and intolerant. Also, since you are slightly unorganized and unsettled, you are capable of driving others crazy

       urlLink MSN Encarta - 10 Words You Simply Must Know   1. Defenestrate: "throw somebody or something out of window: to throw something or somebody out of a window (formal or humorous)"   It is quite entertaining to defenestrate paper airplanes.   2. Garbology: "study of waste materials: the study of a cultural group by an examination of what it discards"  Garbology might be a good career choice for dumpster divers. Recycling may make the job of future garbologists extremely difficult--they'll have less to study.  3. Digerati: "computer experts: people who have or claim to have a sophisticated expertise in the area of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web"   Not too long ago, computer expertise was considered nerdy. These days, many people strive to be among the digerati.   4. Antipodes:          1. "places at opposite sides of world: places at opposite sides of the world from each other, or the areas at the side of the world opposite from a given place"          2. "opposites: two points, places, or things that are diametrically opposite each other"  One could say that Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli and Warren "Potsie" Weber are antipodes.   5. Hallux: "first digit on the foot: the big toe on the human foot, or the first digit on the hind foot of some mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians (technical)"   The ballerina had her hallux insured for $10 million!   6. Otiose:           1. "not effective: with no useful result or practical purpose"           2. "worthless: with little or no value"           3. "lazy: unwilling or uninterested in working or being active (archaic)"  Will e-mail render traditional letter writing otiose? Let's hope not.   7. Cullet: "glass to be recycled: broken or waste glass returned for recycling"  Don't forget to take the cullet out to the curbside, and be sure to put it next to the trash, not in it.   8. Pellucid:          1. "clear in meaning: easy to understand or clear in meaning (formal)"         2. "transparent: allowing all or most light to pass through (literary)"    The police officer's warning was pellucid: drivers must go the speed limit in the school zone.   9. Borborygmus: "stomach rumble: the rumbling sounds made by the movement of gases in the stomach and intestine (technical)"   If you lay your head on someone's stomach, you are likely to hear borborygmus.   10. Embrangle: "perplex somebody: to confuse, perplex, or entangle somebody or something (archaic)"   As Lord Needlebottom attempted to explain the rules of cricket, his American friends became more and more embrangled.

       urlLink Karma Astrology: Your Sun Sign's Karmic Tasks - astrology.com :Libra: Karmic Life Lessons Ruled by lovely Venus, Libra is all about sweetness and romance, art and beauty, balance and charm. As the Sign of the Scales, one of Libra's great concerns is justice and equality, but this Sign may be even more concerned with partnerships. Friendships and romance feed Libra's soul; a social butterfly (and always a delightful host), Libra hardly ever finds itself without a lover. Those born under its influence truly prefer togetherness to being alone and tend to feel distinctly uncomfortable when single. They even have a hard time when they simply find themselves on their own for an evening without companionship. This marks Libra's greatest Karmic task: To stop looking to others to fill the perceived empty parts of the soul. Librans truly believe they're better off with others' constant support and companionship, and in many ways they're right: Team efforts can often get much more done than an individual, and an evening out with friends can be more fun than spending it home alone. It's the driving need for support and reassurance behind the urge for companionship, however, that is Libra's puzzle to solve.  Librans simply haven't learned -- or don't trust -- that their souls are complete as is. They don't need to rely on others for support; they have themselves. However, they often don't realize this and instead commit lots of energy to seeking and securing others' approval. The trouble is, seeking approval can actually be considered a procrastination device. It can certainly inhibit progress if the approval sought isn't found. As a Cardinal Sign, Libra has lots of energy to start new projects and get things going, but its commitment not to proceed until everyone is working together smoothly is unrealistic and may be the very thing that stops the project completely. Libra needs to realize that not everyone can, will or even should get along all the time; when dissenting opinions make tempers flare, Libra would do well to push ahead, even if that has to happen alone.  Differences of opinion and arguments can be very difficult for diplomatic Libra to handle. When disagreements occur, Librans tend to react in several different ways: They might become indecisive, refusing to take a stand as that would be akin to taking sides. Alternatively, some Librans will use their natural charisma to try to charm others into "good behavior." This is fine -- to a point. Sometimes Librans take their yen for harmony so far they're willing to lie or manipulate just to keep things running smoothly. In the end, of course, this kind of behavior rarely pays off; in fact, it may only further upset that balance that Libra is trying so hard to find. But why place so much important on balance in the first place? It's impossible to make everyone happy and one could use up a lot of energy trying, and all in vain.  Libra must learn that keeping everyone happy isn't the most important thing in life. Furthermore, others' approval is fickle and not to be counted on; Libra would do well to realize that when getting too caught up in wanting to be liked by all. Libra can learn from Aries's brash approach to life about placing less importance on outside opinion. Libra can look to emotional Cancer to learn how to confront feelings, even when they're frightening or uncomfortable. And Capricorn can teach Libra the importance and success of hard work done solo, carried over the long-term.

       urlLink Love Compatibility: Libra and Aries : Libra and Aries Part 2 of 2  Aries is a Fire Sign and Libra is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it grow and spread. Aries can have a very positive effect on Libra's growth, ideas and progress; Aries can help Libra put their ideas into action. Working together can be challenging at times, however, due to their polarity. Aries's fast-paced, impetuous approach to projects may conflict with Libra's more balanced, intellectual approach. However, both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and at the end of a long, active day, Aries can come home full of interesting stories to tell the more cerebral Libra!   Aries and Libra are both Cardinal Signs. They both have a lot of initiative -- but lack in follow-through. They both tend to start things they're never going to finish, whether it's a job, a project, a relationship ... Aries will appear to be the leader because of their energy and forceful nature, but Libra leads from an intellectual standpoint. Both Signs want to be in charge, but Aries uses force and sometimes intimidation to get what they want while Libra uses charm and sometimes manipulation. Compromise is essential to this relationship's health. Diplomatic Libra has a much easier time with compromise than does Aries, who strongly dislikes yielding to another person, viewing it as submission. Libra may have to give in more often to Aries's wishes in order to keep the peace that they so cherish.   What's the best aspect of the Aries-Libra relationship? The harmony resulting from the union of Venus and Mars. The balance between self and other represented by this polarity is a great learning experience for both Signs. Each brings to the relationship what the other is missing, making for a wonderful balance.

       urlLink Friendship Profiles based on Sun Signs : "Aries Friendship Profile As fire can be a fleeting thing, so can be the friendship of a Ram. If you want to call an Aries up for a night on the town, you'll have an exciting companion for the evening -- but don't try to make plans for next week. This Sign needs variety in their friendships. If one group of people can't keep up with their constantly changing interests, they'll move on to new friends. Not that they ever lack for companionship: The Ram is well liked for their edge, so making new friends is never a big problem. Friends are nice, but not exactly necessary for independent Aries, who doesn't need a big group to have fun. When they are in one, though, their competitive nature is liable to get the better of them. Don't try to borrow even a cup of sugar from this one. Ruled by the First House of Self, selfishness can sometimes take the upper hand when it's a choice between people and possessions. On the other hand, the Ram can be very warm toward their friends. As long as Aries feels that they are the number one friend in your life, you can count on having an exciting, albeit brief, whirlwind of fun.  Best Friend Bets: Gemini, Aquarius "

It's not that the Scales enjoy being late, it's just that they take their time to decide anything in enough time to make it anywhere. They may make you wait, but Libra is a great friend to have. They can charm the socks off even the stodgiest of people, and, as their friend, you'll never be able to stay mad at them for very long. Libra hates being alone, so expect your friend to be a bit demanding of your time and attention. They'll make up for it, though. Libra will be able to talk their way into the swankiest restaurants and hottest clubs. If you ever need anything, they know exactly who to call, and the person on the other end will feel honored to help them out. Even if they do need to stand in front of their closet for hours, whatever they wear will be in perfect taste, and you can count on them to help you look just as chic. Don't worry if your Libra buddy seems a little down at times. They'll leap out of that soon enough, ready to take on another fun adventure. Best Friend Bets: Leo, Sagittarius "

If your partner meets your needs, however, you are extremely loving and nurturing in long-term relationships. You treat others with tenderness and care, making you much sought-after and adored. The past is very important to you; you remember anniversaries and touching occasions which you celebrate with loving remembrances. That same remembrance of the past is your downfall, however; you may remember past hurts too keenly and be reluctant to be vulnerable. Love requires that vulnerability and you'd be wise to remember the lessons you've learned from past hurts but to remember that it's important not to guard your emotions with an iron fist and to be a little less sensitive."

illusions about you Guess what I never did And when I said When I said I'll take it I meant I meant as is  Just give up And admit you're an asshole You would be in some good company And I think you'd find that your friends would forgive you Or maybe I am just speaking for me  When I look around I think this, this is good enough And I try to laugh At whatever life brings Cuz when I look down I just miss all the good stuff And when I look up I just trip over things  I've got no illusions about you Guess what i never did When I say When I say I'll take it I mean I mean as is      Willing To Fight  Lyrics  The windows of my soul are made of one way glass don't bother looking into my eyes if there's something you want to know, just ask I got a dead bolt stroll where I'm going is clear I won't wait for you to wonder I'll just tell you why I'm here  'cause I know the biggest crime is just to throw up your hands say this has nothing to do with me I just want to live as comfortably as I can you got to look outside your eyes you got to think outside your brain you got to walk outside you life to where the neighborhood changes  tell me who is your boogieman that's who I will be you don't have to like me for who I am but we'll see what you're made of by what you make of me I think that it's absurd that you think I am the derelict daughter I fight fire with words words are hotter than flames words are wetter than water  I got friends all over this country I got friends in other countries too I got friends I haven't met yet I got friends I never knew I got lovers whose eyes I've only seen at a glance I got strangers for great grandchildren I got strangers for ancestors  I was a long time coming I'll be a long time gone you've got your whole life to do something and that's not very long so why don't you give me a call when you're willing to fight for what you think is real for what you think is right     Used To You  Lyrics  I'm still here because I've got nothing else to do you're an asshole but I'm getting used to you I like the fact that you talk incessantly I got a thing for assholes who tell good stories  I think that drinking is the only thing that you do right you're gonna self-destruct I think that's what I like you like me so you try and make me feel like shit I think it's kind of funny yeah I kind of enjoy it  if you're gonna do it, overdo it that's how you know you're alive go ahead, take yourself a coma nap take a puddle dive  you said, this is my bedroom window you said, this is my view you said, lie down here with me and see the things that I do like you were trying to tell me something about the way you live like you would give me something if you had something to give  and for all your talk you don't say much that's real I think I know more than you about the way that you feel I understand your anger and your apathy I think if I was you, you're who I'd be  I'm still here 'cause I got nothing else to do you're an asshole but I'm getting used to you I could love you, yeah I've entertained the thought but I could never like you so I guess I'd better not     The Waiting Song  Lyrics  your basic average super star is singing about justice and peace and love and I am glaring at the radio, swearing saying that's just what I was afraid of the system gives you just enough to make you think that you see change they will sing you right to sleep and then they'll screw you just the same  but I will wait yes, I will wait for the truth  they think I make a big deal about nothing but they still think I'm kinda cute they joke about the staus quo to break the ice once the ice is broken I hope they all fall through 'cause this is no joke to me they don't fool me with their acts of sensitivity they too shall pass just like everyone who's only here for my ass  and I can't wait oh I can't wait til they get their due  baby I've only got a minute baby I have to go a minute is all my life will ever allow let's grow old and die together let's do it now because you'll do all the jobs no one else will do and you'll step aside and you will let me come through you have all my respect I'll leave it here when I go maybe I never told you, baby maybe you don't know  but maybe if we wait if we wait things will improve maybe we just wait and things will improve you know, they've got to improve  your basic average superstar is singing about justice and peace and love and I am glaring at the radio swearing saying that's just what I was afraid of the system gives you just enough to make you think that you see change they'll sing you right to sleep and then they'll screw you just the same  he says I know you have to go you have gone before we are fighting on two different fronts of the same war but no matter what else I will do I will wait for you

       urlLink Free Love Test : Inter-planetary aspects  These concern the possible relationships between two charts: especially the emotional relationship , but also those on the social, intellectual and spiritual levels.  -346 Opposition Sun - Sun  Negative aspect: Certainly enough conflict to ruin a whole day, if not a whole life. If at first the relationship is charming and agreeable, it will quickly end up disharmonious and life together will become unbearable. If one of the two does not make an effort, or does not find a compromise, it leads irrevocably to a breakup.  -178 Square Venus - Mars  Negative aspect: A love that is particularly based on physical understanding, a passionate love with all its negative sides: possessiveness, jealousy, aggressiveness. Such a union is unlikely to last.  143 Conjunction Sun - Pluto  Positive aspect: It's love-at-first-sight, the great passion; they will be drawn to each other like two magnets, they will always have to see and touch each other. Very good sexual understanding, typically very passionate. It must be said that this type of relationship won't last forever, it won't develop into a quiet and tender love and even less so into friendship. One will suffer when the passion of the other dies, it will be a very difficult time to live through.  -108 Opposition Mercury - Venus  Negative aspect: Their relationship will sometimes be agreeable, sometimes disturbed. They will like to share their ideas which are not always to the other's taste, so that they may have interminable discussions in order to convince each other of their mistakes, lack of judgement or lack of taste.  -91 Opposition Mercury - Venus  Negative aspect: Their relationship will sometimes be agreeable, sometimes disturbed. They will like to share their ideas which are not always to the other's taste, so that they may have interminable discussions in order to convince each other of their mistakes, lack of judgement or lack of taste.  82 Trine Venus - Jupiter  Positive aspect: This union will be completely successful. A couple that is happy to be alive, and to live together, with a pleasant family and home, total confidence in each other (and with reason), intellectual understanding, similar tastes.  81 Trine Venus - Jupiter  Positive aspect: This union will be completely successful. A couple that is happy to be alive, and to live together, with a pleasant family and home, total confidence in each other (and with reason), intellectual understanding, similar tastes.  -73 Opposition Venus - Venus  Negative aspect: A union unlikely to last.  -58 Square Saturn - Neptune  Negative aspect: Unlucky union.

I'm going to hang up this phone and then show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules or controls, borders or boundaries.

All they really want is to be maintained in the good opinion they have of themselves.  * Albert Camus    How can sincerity be a condition of friendship? A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing.  * Albert Camus    Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship--never.  * Charles Caleb Colton    What a wretched lot of old shrivelled creatures we shall be by-and-by. Never mind--the uglier we get in the eyes of others, the lovelier we shall be to each other; that has always been my firm faith about friendship.  * George Eliot    A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.  * Ralph Waldo Emerson    It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them.  * Ralph Waldo Emerson    The only way to have a friend is to be one.  * Ralph Waldo Emerson    Real friendship is shown in times of trouble;  prosperity is full of friends.  * Euripedes    It is in the thirties that we want friends. In the forties we know they won't save us any more than love did.  * F. Scott Fitzgerald    No man can be happy without a friend, nor be sure of his friend till he is unhappy.  * Thomas Fuller    Your friend is the man who knows all about you, and still likes you.  * Elbert Hubbard    My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, you've had a great life.  * Lee Iacocca    A true friend is the greatest of all blessings, and that which we take the least care of all to acquire.  * François Duc de La Rochefoucauld    However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship.  * François Duc de La Rochefoucauld    The most deadly fruit is borne by the hatred which one grafts on an extinguished friendship.  * Gotthold Ephraim Lessing    It's no good trying to keep up old friendships. It's painful for both sides. The fact is, one grows out of people, and the only thing is to face it.  * W. Somerset Maugham    We know our friends by their defects rather than by their merits.  * W. Somerset Maugham    If a man should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because it was I.  * Michel de Montaigne    Love demands infinitely less than friendship.  * George Jean Nathan    Women can form a friendship with a man very well; but to preserve it--to that end a slight physical antipathy must probably help.  * Friedrich Nietzsche    Hold a true friend with both your hands.  * Nigerian Proverb    To me, fair friend, you never can be old  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,  Such seems your beauty still.  * William Shakespeare    Friendship is constant in all other things  Save in the office and affairs of love.  * William Shakespeare    The proper office of a friend is to side with you when you are in the wrong. Nearly anybody will side with you when you are in the right.  * Mark Twain    Friendship is the marriage of the soul, and this marriage is liable to divorce.  * Voltaire    Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.  * Oscar Wilde  --- Classic Friendship Quote by Alexander Pope  Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspir'd.   Classic Friendship Quote by Robert Browning  Over my head his arm he flung, Against the world.   Classic Friendship Quote by Walt Whitman  I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love.   Classic Friendship Quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson  A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature.   Classic Friendship Quote by Benjamin Franklin  You and I were long friends: you are now my enemy, and I am yours.   Classic Friendship Quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson  The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it.   Classic Friendship Quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson  The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one.   Classic Friendship Quote by Alexander Pope  Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe, Are lost on hearers that our merits know.   Classic Friendship Quote by Alexander Pope  Cursed be the verse, how well so e'er it flow, That tends to make one worthy man my foe.   Classic Friendship Quote by Alexander Pope  A generous friendship no cold medium knows, Burns with one love, with one resentment glows.   Classic Friendship Quote by Francis Bacon  Cosmus, Duke of Florence, was wont to say of perfidious friends, that "We read that we ought to forgive our enemies; but we do not read that we ought to forgive our friends."  --  1) John Greenleaf Whittier For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, 'It might have been.'   2) Jim Rohn How sad to see a father with money and no joy. The man studied economics, but never studied happiness.   3) Psalms They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.   4) Winston Churchill Solitary trees, if they grow at all, grow strong.   5) Marcus Aurelius Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.   6) Malcolm X, Malcolm X Speaks Usually when people are sad, they don't do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.   7) Voltaire He is a hard man who is only just, and a sad one who is only wise.   8) Olive Schreiner My feeling is that there is nothing in life but refraining from hurting others, and comforting those who are sad.   9) Wizard of Oz Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable.    10) W. M. Lewis The tragedy of life is not that it ends so soon, but that we wait so long to begin it.  --- Trying to forget someone you love is like trying to remember someone you never knew.   It takes a couple seconds to say Hello, but forever to say Goodbye.   Nothing hurts more than realising he meant everything to you, but you meant nothing to him.   Moving on is simple, it's what you leave behind that makes it so difficult   I dont miss him, I miss who I thought he was   There's this place in me where your finger prints still rest... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me.   If someone you love hurts you cry a river, build a bridge, and get over it.   I miss you a little, I guess you could say, a little too much, a little too oftern, and a little more each day.   Never be sad for what is over, just be glad that it was once yours.   Here's to the men we love, here's to the men that love us... Since the men that we love, aren't the men that love us ... screw the men... here's to us.   I’m going to smile and make you think I’m happy, I’m going to laugh, so you don’t see me cry, I’m going to let you go in style, and even if it kills me- I’m going to smile.   There's a girl in my mirror crying tonight, and there's nothing I can say to make her feel alright.   You don't die from a broken heart - you only wish you did.   The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love is having to wake up.

       urlLink Assessing Your Skills: What Makes You Different : "Assessing Your Skills What Makes You Different from All the Others? by Carole Martin Monster Contributing Writer      Gina had recently been laid off after working as a marketing manager in a high tech company for the past five years. She was distracted as she walked through the aisles of the supermarket. She was thinking about ways to market herself into a new job. She stood in front of the cereal selection, overwhelmed by the number of brands to choose from -- more than 100 varieties.  Suddenly, it dawned on her: This must be what it's like for hiring managers to look at all those resumes received in answer to ads and postings. How do they choose? What do they look for? How does one get selected? How can I make my product stand out?  The Packaging  The packaging on the cereal box is certainly the start. Eye-catching colors and descriptive words will draw attention -- low fat, energy boosting, added vitamins -- all the things consumers are looking for. But what are employers looking for? The words you choose will be key. Using words that will interest the companies will grab their attention.  The Ingredients  The list of ingredients -- the skills you have to offer -- is also important. Gina couldn't wait to get home and write down her skills and what made her unique to the position. She had a new slant to explore.  She remembered reading in a book that skills can be grouped into three categories:  Skills learned through past experience and education (knowledge-based skills).  Skills you bring with you to any job (transferable or portable skills).  Personal traits, the things that make you who you are.  The Assessment Tool  Gina divided a piece of paper into three columns and labeled them with 'previous experience,' 'por"

       urlLink FAQ Question #117   Someone broke into my LiveJournal account! If someone broke into your account and changed your password, you can still usually reclaim control of your journal. You need access to an email account that you had previously validated for your LiveJournal account.   If your email address has also been broken into, you will have to solve that problem before dealing with getting your stolen LiveJournal account back. Security of users' own email accounts is beyond LiveJournal's responsibility and ability, and you may wish to talk to whoever is hosting your email account.   Your LiveJournal account's security is based upon your email account's security. If you believe that your email account is secure, but are not positive, you should always change your email account password before changing your LiveJournal password.

       urlLink LJ Security   How do I make all my journal entries Friends-Only or Private? To make all of your past entries Friends-Only or Private, you must edit each entry individually (http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=2) to change the security level on each one. LiveJournal does not provide a way to change all of your past journal entries from Public to Friends-Only or Private with one command. See http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=24 for details about the various security settings.   Many clients available for download include the ability to edit journal entries. This may speed up the process of converting your previous entries to Friends-only or Private. For more information on your preferred client, consult its documentation or its menu options. See http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=158 for information on downloading a client.                       *   LiveJournal does provide the means to set a minimum security level on all posts you may make in the future. Setting this option will prevent you from slipping up and posting a public entry that you meant to post as Friends-only or Private. You will still be able to post an entry with a lower security setting by posting it with the minimum security you have set, then editing it to change the security setting.   To set the minimum security level of all future entries in your journal, log in (http://www.livejournal.com/login.bml) and go to the Admin Console (http://www.livejournal.com/admin/console) and execute the following command:   set newpost_minsecurity     Do not enter the   symbols; these are only for reference purposes. To set the minimum security level to Friends-only, replace   with "friends". To set the minimum security level to Private, replace   with "private". To turn off the minimum security level, replace   with "public".                       *   If you maintain a community, you can set the minimum security level to "friends only" by executing the following command:   set for   newpost_minsecurity friends   Do not enter the   symbols; these are only for reference purposes. Replace   with the username of the community.

      this question:    In the past century, fiction authors and entertainment media have joined forces to present a ficticious culture with its own beliefs, rituals, and alleged traditions. Select a ficticious culture and analyze the ways in which the authors and media directors have tried to make the group seem plausible by giving it a package of synthetic myths.

       urlLink Lord of the Rings - Credenda/Agenda   {excerpt} Their shared love of myth was at the foundation of their friendship. It was also the basis of Lewis' conversion to the Christian faith. One night Tolkien and Hugo Dyson had a lengthy talk with Lewis in which they showed him that "myth" need not be equated with "false." As a result of this talk, Lewis came to see that the story of Christ was true myth. But this introduced an important difference between the men. Lewis rapidly became an apologist for the Christian faith, but he did so as a Protestant. Lewis had been brought up an Ulster Protestant—his nurse had once warned him against stepping in a puddle full of "wee, nastie popes." As Lewis grew and matured in his Christian life, he grew increasingly committed to the Protestant faith. What had been his default position became a matter of deep conviction. Tolkien later said, "He would become again a Northern Ireland Protestant" (Tolkien, p. 168).  Let's turn to Tolkien's great work, The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien argued in multiple places that while all of life has allegorical elements, his story was by no means formal allegory. Such distinctions were very important to both Tolkien and Lewis. The Pilgrim's Regress by Lewis is allegory. The Great Divorce is symbolism. But The Lord of the Rings and the Narnia stories are subcreated and mythopoeic realms, not allegory.  However, the mythopoeic themes of The Lord of the Rings, although not allegorical, did involve certain key meanings. In developing this world, Tolkien attributed it to linguistics, his passionate love for growing things, and "the deep response to legends (for lack of a better word) that have what I would call the North-western temper and temperature" (Letters, p. 212). In other words, we have a world made up of words, life, and northern nobility. The combination was and is potent. Lewis put it this way: "Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart" ("On Stories").  With this said, what connections can we make within the story? "Elves and Men are represented as biologically akin in this `history', because Elves are certain aspects of Men and their talents and desires, incarnated in my little world . . ." (Letters, p. 189.). In short, Tolkien saw them as the incarnation of nobility—beauty, sorrow, wisdom, authority. They represent "beauty and grace of life and artifact" (Letters, p. 85). They are a representation of a part of human nature (p. 149). If "I were pressed to rationalize, I should say that they represent really Men with greatly enhanced aesthetic and creative faculties, greater beauty and longer life, and nobility" (Letters, p. 176).  Another important theme in Tolkien's work is the relationship between art and machinery. A very interesting contrast is found here. True magic for him was not a matter of wizards who "chirp and mutter," to use Isaiah's taunt. According to Tolkien, Gandalf was an angelic being, one of the lesser Valar, not a wizard in our sense. For Tolkien, the machinery that clanks and smokes was always wicked. And power-seeking magic did the same. Frictionless technology was not really magic, not science, but rather art. Authority and dominion in the world through art was noble, and domination through machinery and raw power was ignoble.
