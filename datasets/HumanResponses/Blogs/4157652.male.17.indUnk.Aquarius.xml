        Rise and shine!!!     Hi blog its me again… lolZ who else excepts me rite? “-     Man its basic science ut once again!!! arGGh… guess science not my cup of tea… but still need to like science to do well in it. Hope I do well in it… cos the l@st one I think I had flunked it. muahahaHa =) but I had tried my best in doing the test… yeAh  Hmmm it’s really ridiculous now trying to find the uncle khoo’s son. I wonder why I am not his son but really shared love and concern for him. Hope to find his son so as that he can attend to his father’s funeral matter… I still kinda sad over his death… cos he jus passed away like tat… although he had some illnesses.. sometimes death bring forth pain as someone we loved so much had left us  I really think that all of us as lights should shine for e Lord even brighter in the end times as the 2nd coming of our Lord. Isn’t it pitiful when u can’t see Ur loved ones being saved into the kingdom.. His death also reminds me that I should seek His face more and more.. I should also embark on His promises cos He is the only way, the truth and the life to all souls in this world. Indeed the war is approaching and the rapture will be a tormenting 7 years. It’s really a test of faith in us to be a conversionisT for Him.. no weapon formed against me shall prosper in His name.  It’s really sickening to have classmates teasing about me!!! gRRR kinda pissed off by them… gosh to think that they claimed to be my “friends”. Hai2 hai2… reallI feeling pissed lorz… hope God will change the whole situation around for me.. =)  hehe… today have ministry helping out for the church 15th anniversary!!! Weee…so happi that can be a part of this whole celebration.. gonna head down to church at ard 7.30 to help out for the making of the props itself… feels like home when I reached His house… hope to do the stuff nice nice leh… cos as his disciples, we must have e spirit of excellence in His name!! yeAh  hmMm… today lesson quite ok ba.. lotsa codes flying aLl ard.. hehe… kinda wat lor… I understand e prob tod@e but no mood to do lorZ… hai2 hai2… maybe yesterday chat make me realize sumthing important that I must do…  buT overall is quite good todae as my faV band is coming real S00n !!! rofl… hehe (shhh hIllSong UniTeD is coming to my ChurCh close to 12 days from now) finally can see them in person once again… feel so m0tivaTedd listeninG to their songs. reallI waNNa thank them for singing their best for our Lord !! yeAh I think all of us are serving for a greater purp0se in Him.. all of Us will bE all out for Him as fishing boats. Indeed all of us will speak off words of wisdom as the eyes have not see and the ears have not heard of it.  hmMm… my blog today kinda long today… hehe but who minds right? ; ) I hope that today’s stuff that I am going to do. I make a covenant with Him and He will show me the way and a sound mind to do the props later on.  Lastly, indeed obedience is greater than sacrifice. i also wanna lift up the missions team in ur hands bless them as they carry out ur signs N wonder in ur name!! yeAh bless them wif divine health and prosper eir family like never before... gtg liaozzz need to do work le! Ciaoz =) God BleZZ

       oh oh.... i forget to blog yesterdae!!! .. but who cares rite???? "_  kinda sian today... cos of wat happen this weekk... begin to qn God of His promises... Indeed, there's a season for everything " )  iN EcclesiaTes 3:1- 8    here is a time for everything, a season for every activity under heaven.  A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest.  A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to rebuild.  A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.  A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to turn away.  A time to search and a time to lose. A time to keep and a time to trhow away.  A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak up.  A time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace   after reading this, indeed God's timing is not our timing.. God do this for a purpose.. i realli sensed an urgency to be a fisher boat for Him to win more souls b4 His 2nd coming... i pray that i wun let another potential so be slipped down my hands =)   for today.... kinda happi went some shoppinG... bought one new shoe... so comfortable... N i luV it!!!
