      This past weekend was the Pride festival, which actually was probably my most fun pride yet (well, two years ago when I hooked up with the tennis pro was pretty good, i have to say).  This time I ran in the Pride 5K through Grant Park on Saturday morning, volunteered for Marriage Equality Georgia that afternoon, and still found time to drink myself into oblivion on Saturday night.  A nice, full day if I say so myself.  Though you see the strangest things at Pride.  Including tatoos.  It never ceases to amaze me what people will permanently ink on their bodies.  I just don't trust myself to make such a lifelong decision, since I know I'll probably change.  I've changed so much since high school, since college, hell, since two years ago.  Plus over time they bleed and get all fuzzy looking.  They can be kind of hot on other people, but I don't think I can handle one.  I'll just have to wear necklaces, bracelets, and armbands.  Or get highlights in my hair (which I did last month, very subtle ones though).

      Okay, will someone please explain the difference between Marshall's and TJMaxx?  They're owned by the same company, have the same merchandise, and are frequently in the same shopping center.  The only difference I can see is that Marshall's is blue and the Maxx is red.  Either way, they're still both better than ROSS.  Why do I care so much?  Well, I've developed a nasty little addiction over the past few months of perusing these off-price chains every time one is in sight.  I ALWAYS seem to find something to buy, even if it's just socks, belts, or undershirts.  Yes, it's off-priced, but that adds up after a while.  I need to quit going into these places so I can give my credit card balance a little smack down.  I'd love to have that thing eliminated by the time I go to Europe this fall (which, by the way, is virtually impossible unless I quit leaving the house when I'm not working).  It's not an unreasonable amount, but still nothing to take for granted.

      Well, people tell me that I am funny.  They say that I have a lot to say.  I hear "you should start a blog".  But why?  Why do people care what I write on the internet?  Don't we already have enough people posting their thoughts and pontificating here in cyberspace?  I have always wanted to keep a journal, but I hate writing (physically writing, not the craft of writing, mind you).  I'm a much better typer (trust me, have you seen my handwriting?).  So here goes nothing.  I'll write in here from time to time and will at some point start telling people about it.  I'm keeping in step with my 50th percentile achievement on trendy web things.  I was hardly the first person on friendster, but I was probably the half-life.  Same with this.  Lots of folks will start their blogs after me, but probably half of those who will ultimately start a blog have already started theirs.  And what does blog stand for?  Who thought of that word?

      I've always been interested in politics.  I memorized all the Presidents, in order, when I was in fourth grade.  I've seen Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton speak in person.  I majored in political science in college.  I'm a member of Young Democrats of Fulton County, Georgia Equality, Marriage Equality Georgia, and the Human Rights Campaign.  I contributed to the 2004 campaigns of John Kerry and Georgia Senator Mary Squires (in her failed attempt for the democratic nomination for U.S. Senate).  I have countless political blogs, news websites, and advocacy groups bookmarked on my work and home browsers.    What does all this mean?  Well, I keep toying with the idea of one day running for office myself.  I'd love to start off in the Georgia State House.  I'd love to craft policy and law, advocate for my constituents, and really be a leader in installing progressive values into mainstream Georgia culture.  So many legislators, in Georgia as well as other states, just pander to their constituencies and act in such a way that they think will ensure them re-election during the next go-round.  They care less about being a true leader and helping to educate why we need to take certain steps and more about their simple job security.  Yes, keeping one's job is vital to continually advocate for the causes about which a legislator feels passionate; but there's a nice balance than can be struck there, I'm convinced.  Many legislators think only of their little district that elected them.  Yes, one of the charges of a legislator is to represent the people in his/her district, but I'm also of the mindset that thinks that a legislator has to look beyond his/her district and think of the consequences that all actions will have on the state/country.      I could give countless examples to illustrate my philosophy on political leadership, but this blog entry is already huge enough!  I just think that "Senator Taylor Brown" has a nice ring to it.  Now I just have to start behaving like a mature politician, which means curtailing my odd habits in public (screeching like a howlermonkey, putting my hands down guys pants, etc.).  I'm not worried about my past catching up to me; look at all the things that have been trotted out as ammunition against Clinton and GW Bush to no avail.  I just need to mature before I make that leap into campaigning.  I can do it, but it won't be tomorrow.  One of these days ...

      I've always been a travel nut ... I got my first Rand McNally Road Atlas for Christmas when I was only seven years old.  Each year, Santa brings me my atlas.  I love to just look at it and memorize the names of cities, their location, their population, their counties, the malls and colleges located there, and their proximity to other things.  I also love memorizing the rank of each state population-wise and size-wise.  I know the highest points of most states, and I can name off every county in South Carolina and most in NC.  I love area codes, ZIP codes, and consequently get called out at parties, etc., to show off my freak talent.  My love of demographics and travel operations is probably one of the weirdest thing about me, but I've learned to accept my talent and wrap my loving arms around it.  I'm always the go-to guy for directions, etc., which makes me happy, since I know my friends at least keep me around for that.  Then there's travel operations ... hotels, air, car rentals, etc.  I really should be a travel columnist instead of a fundraiser.  I get so jealous when I read these columns by Chris McGinnis, Peter Greenberg, and Clara Bosonetto.  I know, given the resources and the time, I could become as good as if not better than all these travel experts.  Chris McGinnis has his own company, the Ticket Portal, here in town, and I'd love to go to work for him doing research, reports, lectures, TV shows ... basically everything he does.  You can frequently see his work on CNN Headline News and at CNN.com's travel section.    When I was younger, and before the web was everywhere, I had memorized all the reservations number for all the major hotel chains.  In fact, I can still rattle off many of them.  I used to do all the calling and rate-hunting for all our family's vacations, as well as research for friends.  Consequently, as I got older, I always seemed to be the travel coordinator for all trips, which I rather enjoyed.  Especially once I entered college and began taking trips without my parents and sister, I mostly call the shots in trip planning, and it makes me so happy when friends make comments about how much they enjoyed the trip or -- one of my favorites -- "I can't believe you got this place for this price; it's awesome!"  I'll frequently write about travel and trips, since I love going just about anywhere and doing just about anything.  Even in the most boring city you can find fun with the right people and the right mindset.

      Oddly enough, I'm not talking about hunting for a mate ... I'm literally talking about fruit.  I have developed quite an affinity for oranges this year and usually eat one daily as a mid-morning snack.  Though it's tougher to find good oranges than one would think.  Sometimes I'll pick them out individually out of the big stack of oranges in the produce section of a standard grocery store (like Kroger or Publix), somtimes I'll buy a bag of oranges from said grocery stores, and a couple of times I've paid high dollar for big, beautiful oranges at Whole Foods.  It's been hit or miss from Kroger and Publix; sometimes I get good sweet ones, sometimes they're sour, sometimes they get mushy too quickly, and sometimes I mistakingly buy the juicing ones that you use for squeezing orange juice and I make a mess in our work kitchen.  Whole Foods, surprisingly, has yet to provide me with a good orange.  Very dissappointing once you consider that I've paid around $2 a pound for those little buggers.  Most oranges that are in the stores come from California, not Florida, which surprised me since I'm much closer to one than the other.  However, I bought a bag of oranges last night at Kroger and realized this morning when I was preparing my lunch that these oranges are from South Africa!  I don't believe I've ever consciously eaten anything from the dark continent, by pure chance of course.  Today I did slice into one of these beauties, which are slightly smaller than the average naval, and pleasantly discovered it to be perfectly sweet, juicy, and delicious!  Probably one of my favorite oranges so far!  What amazes me even more is that this bag of nine oranges cost $2.49 ... and that the company still made profit after growing, harvesting, and shipping these oranges all the way from South Africa!  And Florida oranges usually are similarly priced.  I guess in Florida they ship them first class, like Michael Jackson does for his dolls.
