						   I am the little panda, therefore there is a big panda.  You can't have one without the other.  Of course, the big panda is my boyfriend.  We don't get to see each other as much as we want to, the big panda has a job that requires travel and for some reason also requires him to have an apartment in Kansas City.  For the next two weeks, I will be going to the lovely city of Kansas City.  He is the second major relationship in my life.  The first one ended disastrously with a dear john letter and I'm very glad that it did cause I wouldn't have met the big panda and I wouldn't be so happy now.  I don't believe in soulmates but the big panda is the closest thing to one that I will ever have.

						     Here is probably my favorite Ranma fic,  "Hearts of Ice" by Krista Perry.  It can be found at www.akane.org.  It continues along the lines of canon while writing a beautiful story focusing around Akane who is one of my favorite characters.  She's stubborn and pig headed  but she's also kind and cares about Ranma.

						   I've got my story, Buffy/Ranma crossover.  Buffy and Dawn are traveling around the world and end up in Japan.  They mistake the antics of Ranma and Co for slayer style stuff.  I've even got the big bad backed up by japanese myth.  Now I gotta do a search for fics that are out there like this.

						   After typing fan fiction and grammar into google, I started thinking.  I've been reading for so long, and I just read that readers make the best writers so why don't I write something.  First thing that comes to mind is what do I write?  Do I start with an original story or do I try my hand at fan fiction?  I guess inspiration will come to me.

						   I'm obsessed with a lot of things. First of all is reading. I've always been the girl who would take out 20 books from the library and read them all within 3 weeks. This obsession lead to fan fiction. Fan fiction lets you live out a fandom to the fullest. It can also seriously warp the subject of the fandom itself. The best site to look for any fan fiction is of course fanfiction.net. But you have to shift through lots of bad fics to find the gems. There are two things that stop me from reading most fics: bad grammar/spelling, and fics that are not reasonable e we're going to take out buffy because we don't like her and we're not gonna explain why she's not there. What I would like to see more in fanfiction sites are places that sort fics by rating or number of reviews. The twisted hellmouth (www.tthfanfic.com) offers a listing of its top fan fiction by number of reviews. I like fanfiction.net because you can sort by length, but I wished it sorted by number of reviews also. I love long stories, the more chapters the better.  For me it all started with Ranma 1/2. My love of anime started in 98 when I first started watching Sailor Moon. I soon discovered, at the local mall, a store called Suncoast. There they had many videos and that included Ranma. Ranma is a romantic comedy/martial arts fest. What made it great for fan fiction was the range of different characters within a series, a world that was wacky and real at the same time, and how open it was with who could be together. For excellent Ranma or any anime fan fiction, I've always gone to the ffml, or the fan fiction mailing list. It's losing it's steam nowadays, but it's also part of my waning interest in anime.  Next came Harry Potter, this one's a given. Who wouldn't want to explore the all the possibilities of a world filled with magic and with characters that could develop into so much. Places that are great for HP fiction are www.schnoogle.com and www.sugarquill.net.  Lately, I've been readin Buffy fan fiction. Both Buffy and Angel have been favorite series of mine since they started and since both are finished series I'm still craving for more. Two of my favorite sites are www.tthfanfic.com for crossover stories and www.watcherscouncil.com, which is a virtual series.  Recommended fan fiction of the entry:  Bridges by Tassos: This is a Buffy/SG1 crossover. Jack O'neill is Xander's father. It makes it plausible by it's great characterization and the nicely paced story line.
