      Current obsession: My audition     Yes, that's right I actually have an audition tomorrow; for a shoe commercial. They called my place of work, they need someone flexible. I thought it might be fun. But..... there is a reason I stopped the whole acting thing.

      Current obsession: What to do with my life; part 2        Just as a decision is made, the powers that be decide that I can't do that, and everything has to be rethought. Right now, I'm leaning toward School Counseling/psychology, or possibly Marriage and Family counseling. Grad programs are very competitive, and the fact that my Bachelor's is in a completely different area doesn't help.   I'm too friggin' indecisive.

      Current obsession: Makena'lei Gordon Carnahan  I think it's a very beautiful name. I'm all for unusual names, as long as they are actually names. Using your child to make a statement, that ain't right. Makena'lei I like, it's unusual w/o saying "look at me. I came up with a f***ed up name." Knew she'd be gettin' her father's name in there somewhere. Total daddy's girl.

      Current obsession: none (shocking!)   So, I've done a little research into the local community college. Good news! They have a partnership with several 4-year schools; you can earn your Bachelor's or Master's w/o leaving the area. How great is that? I don't know if that's common; I hadn't ever planned on going to a community college. Still have more research to do. But, I was happy to hear that; already have a Bachelor's, kinda wanted to go beyond that.   Weird factoid: The sports teams at said community college are called the Cougars. My alma mater? Also the Cougars.

      Current obsession: CPR        I was just certified for the Job. Found out a few things I didn't know. The whole purpose for chest compression is to pump blood to the brain - minimize brain damage - until the paramedics arrive with their wonders of modern medicine; about one in one thousand cases, chest compression actually starts the heart. Didn't know that.     When a person drowns, the throat closes to prevent water from coming in. We suffocate ourselves. Didn't know that.     The best place to feel a baby's pulse is in the arm.    Movies and TV show CPR as five compressions and a breath - the procedure for a child. Adults need fifteen compressions then a breath.  Interesting

      Current obsession: what to do with my life.  I must educate myself. And I may just have enough of a break in my sixty-hour work week to do just that. What to study and where to study it? Aye, there's the rub. What do I want to be? There's the four P's:  Paralegal  (certainly would make a decent living; could afford the education; could I afford the stress?),  Photographer  (love photography; would I love to cost of the education + cost of starting a business? Would I love the work BEHIND the work; I'm not one to sell myself),  Psychologist  (specifically, child psychologist, a "kiddy shrink", lots of work; lots of time; lots of years; lots of rewards; not the most affordable option), or  Personal Trainer  (also with kiddies; basically what I am doing now - but more money; could afford the education; if I wanted to continue what I'm doing now would I be looking at other options?)  Right now my brain is locked onto the psychologist (even psychiatrist) thing. Whatever that means.  Don't just do something, sit there.....  Closing thought: Isn't it funny how they all start with P?

      Current Obsession: Work   Here's how it works at my place of employ: if you ask for a raise, you have to take on more responsibility. In other words, you could go well above the call of duty, take on multiple projects, grow in a thousand different directions, THEN ask for a raise as compensation. You won't get it. However, if you sit on your butt all day, barely lifting a finger, then say you'll work if you're given more money, you'll get the raise. I think I've just been screwed.    Ya really think I've got a raise comin'? Puh-lease!

      Current obsession: Application  So, I've officially started on my little Quest of Education. I've decided to jump start my brain by taking an English class and a Psychology class from the local community college. It's been 3+ years since I've been in school, and about as many years since I last wrote a paper; I want my brain to be prepared for the onslaught. I'll also be preparing for the GRE while taking these classes. I'll have a better idea of what program to apply to after I get my scores.   But, I want it all done NOW! Oy.

      Current obsession: Computer worms            I had two of them. Apparently for quite some time. Lord knows how many people I infected. Very annoying. My mother, the one most at risk, has chosen not to worry about it. She decided her computer hasn't been affected. Mom, that isn't really a decision that you can make.    Why do I still worry about her?

      Current obsession: School   So, I'm officially registered for the fall semester. I'm just taking an English class and two math classes. I'm kinda anxious to just get on with it, but I'm not really sure which way to go, so it may just be for the best. And I can't seem to sit still. It's not good for me to make decisions when I'm so involved in my feelings.

      Current obsession: Crazy people   I got a complaint from a client at work that doesn't like me. That's fine with me. Like I really care what other people think. But, she doesn't seem to understand that it's her problem; and proceeded to tell me that everything is wrong, and how I should be doing my job (which she is completely clueless about). My boss defended me. I was told by a co-worker that he doesn't take said crazy woman seriously. And yet, I cannot get rid of it in my head. I think that I am angry at the fact that I didn't stand up for myself. I was expecting a normal adult conversation and I was attacked. I can't switch gears that fast. Now, I don't know what to do with this woman. But, I have to see her again.  The other crazy person that I can't get out of my head is my mother. She told me today that she is living with (and will marry) a man that she's been dating for THREE WEEKS!!!!! What the F@*%?!?!?! Well, at least the house is hers.   Crazy people.

      Current obsession: Work.   We are severely understaffed, and one of our most valuable workers got injured today; she fell, hurt her wrist, chest, back, and neck. I got to do one of those really fun last minute substitutions. She was supposed to fill in for another young lady who is going on vacation for three weeks. Now we're out BOTH of them. We don't have enough people as it is. Ah, well... God bless time and a half. I just hope it doesn't mess with my school plans this fall.   Oh, and I did get that raise.

      Current obsession: New phone   I got a new flip phone!! Wooohooo! I have to admit, I live in the dark ages. My computer's six years old. I have Window's 98. I still have a VCR (no tivo). I still use film. So a flip phone that can SEND E-MAIL is pretty nifty to me. It has a color screen, screen savers, wall paper, all that fun computer stuff. Me likey.   Fun.

      Current obsession: Responsibilities       I've taken on quite a few of them, feeling very overwhelmed. There's this project, at work, that I said I'd do. Unfortunately, I haven't the slightest idea how. There's school, which is kinda moving along. I have to take assessment tests. Assessment tests -  at a community college - I already have a bachelor's. Whatever. And, (also at work) things have been going wrong left and right.    I'm in a really good mood.
