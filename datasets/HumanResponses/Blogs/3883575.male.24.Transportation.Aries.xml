      While Jack isn't quite  urlLink "Jim" the wonder dog , we like him anyway.  Jack Jackson was curious about the camera this afternoon.  I think his ears picked up all sorts of insect-like buzzing noises from the lens zooming in and out while I was snapping pictures.      As asses go, Jack is affable when he's not amorous.  When Jack is "in the mood," or rather when the mares are, Jack can be something of a pest.  All hell can break loose.  Not a problem for Jack.  He's usually willing to take a couple of kicks in the head before the mares yield to his affections.  Ah yes, the thrill of the chase.  I guess when the mares have a headache, they have a headache, but Jack has never been known to take a hint.  In the end, the most persistent ass wins.

      Yesterday's high humidity was broken today by clouds and rain, which made it much more pleasant to fence, but I didn't contribute much to today's fencing.     Like the true delinquent I am, I wasted time which could have been productive by instead playing wrong notes on the piano. In the back of my mind I'm thinking I'm preparing myself for a concert at the local nursing home, but like so many of my good intentions, time may run out before I get there. So I play wrong notes for my own pleasure and as an excuse not to fence.    The dogs are still hating all the flies that summer brings. I should see about finding grease to put on their ears as a fly repellant. Farm flies are barbarous like winged leaches.    Some relatives from a neighboring town came by for a visit this morning. We went out to look at the horses, mule, and donkey whom we call "Jack Jackson." Jack gave his standard greeting bray which was greatly enjoyed.     Earlier in the week, we had a neighbor stop by and tell us that one of our animals was out on the road. Leave it to Jack to make an ass of himself. Hopefully Jack will take this new fence as a hint. The new fence does look pretty darn good from the window while I play the piano. Who knows, it may even keep our little white ass in!

      There's a lot going on in the skies over Lower Gulch.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is wind and weather and air currents even on clear sunny days.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like a totally different world in the air.&nbsp; All problems seem to stay grounded where they belong. &nbsp; I haven't been able to see&nbsp;Lower Gulch&nbsp;from&nbsp;the air yet, but that's only because I've been flying close to the airport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when they let me take out the plane by myself I will be able to fly over it sometime. &nbsp; Hazy skies this morning while flying.&nbsp; Evidently there are forest fires in Canada causing&nbsp;smokey conditions.&nbsp; I take more note of the world above the ground when I go sailing in it. &nbsp; A parade today in Lower Gulch, as well.&nbsp; Lots of trucks and tractors, but not much music.&nbsp; I did&nbsp;my community service and played with the only band there.&nbsp; We were pulled&nbsp;on a trailor by one of the trucks there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other music was from a "Christmas in July" float by a local radio station and the staticy Darth Vader march from the trailor of a Lions Club float.&nbsp; Nothing beats live music. &nbsp; It was a parade weekend.&nbsp; There was a parade in another town yesterday we played at, too.&nbsp; "Su Fu Du," a drum-line from South Dakota marched in the&nbsp;parade and in the town square afterwards.&nbsp; They had heart and crazy green exercise uniforms.&nbsp; I thought there was something almost primatively tribal about the way the crowd reacted to their rhythms.&nbsp; As all the hairs on my arm stood on end, it was like I had been transported to the middle of a forest.&nbsp; Luckily their crazy green exercise uniforms kept me grounded in the knowledge that I was on a street in a small midwestern town.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing beats live music.&nbsp; And not much beats flying.&nbsp; To be able to fly away from the grounded concerns of Lower Gulch is at times a&nbsp;soul's delight.

      I started an exercise program.  Ran around the section.  The dogs took the day off and slept in the shade at home.  I was surprised to discover that I sweat a lot when exercising.  My sweat seems to taste salty when I run.  I taste it on my lips when it drips down my face.    Today I came to the revelation that sweat tastes salty because it has salt in it.  I'm more tired after I exercise than before I start, even after I drink water.  Part of the reason I think is that salt is an electrolyte and that the body needs electrolytes in order to transmit electrochemical signals.  Because the body after exercise is short of electrolytes, the muscles don't operate as effectively as they could.  Evidently, there's a fine line to be drawn between  urlLink a proper level of fluid electrolytes  and becoming a  urlLink pillar of salt .  A balance must be struck to keep the body's chemistry in equilibrium.  I'm no doctor, I'm just making all of this up including sophisticated-sounding words to impress myself.

      A lot of rain in Lower Gulch this year.  The mosquitoes and grass love it, much to the dismay of people fearful of West Nile and those with large lawns.  Large, green lawns are better enjoyed when well-groomed and absent of encephalitus-bearing pests.  I guess some people use aromatic candles to keep them at bay.  The dogs don't like the winged beasts much either.  It's not only mosquitoes, it's blood-sucking flies.  The dogs have been down to the crick several times to make themselves mud shields.  Whether a man or dog, when it comes to mosquitoes and blood-sucking flies, you have to do what it takes to protect yourself.

      Hello.  My name is Daniel Francis.  I also write a blog called, "Bad Essays Written Poorly."  I decided to start this site to warehouse commentary even more inane than those for "Bad Essays Written Poorly."  This concludes my premier entry.

						    SAVED FROM THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR   I have sometimes doubted the usefulness of prayer.  Maybe it's futile.  Why waste time murmuring inane well-wishes that could be better put to things such as mowing the lawn or clipping toenails?  At times it sounds pointless to me.  Spending time on an idle activity has no appeal, unless it brings personal pleasure or profit, which some fairly worthless idle activities which need not be named here are actually capable of.  But I don't think prayer is so worthless.  Perhaps life is nothing more than a really great film, (or one really bad, depending on your station in life).    Scott Adams wrote in his book,  urlLink  The Dilbert Future ,   of an idea where our consciousness serves as a bottleneck which chooses reality from millions of possible alternatives.  According to Scott Adam's idea, our existence is analagous to a motion picture, composed of an infinite amount of frames.  Unlike a standard motion picture, there are parallel reels running at the same time, each a slightly different unique variation from the reel next to it.  Our consciousness takes all these reels and makes a coherant story out of it.  Our minds have the ability to switch between reels, but only to the extent that the next scene goes with the story we have already seen.  In this case, our consciousness is nothing more than a bottleneck of a projector to censor the next scene.   urlLink One of Einstein's theories  may lend credibility to this idea.  At least, that's what the producers of the television show,  urlLink  Sliders    hope.  Maybe that's why we love going to the movies, because it takes us out of the driver's seat.    If that makes any sense at all then perhaps the entire world collectively chooses the next frame every instant of our lives.  The next slice of reality is the combined choice of every living being on the planet.  If that is so, then perhaps prayer really does work.  Perhaps focused concentration allows us to choose a next frame that is more appealing.  The more people that focus their concentration on the desired next frame, the better.  Or maybe it's that prayer simply works because there really is a higher power that loves us and hasn't forgotten about us.  Either way, I think prayer works.  It doesn't really matter how, only that I accept that it does.  Whether Scott Adams is right or wrong, I think praying is an activity worth spending more time at, because it works.

						    CUBBIES IN THE PLAYOFFS   A friend notes a curious trend in restaurant dining: the claim of authenticity.  "Authentic" Mexican fajitas, real Chinese General Tsao's Chicken, baklava imported all the way from India are more and more common.  This trend, it seems to my friend, is part of a larger crisis of authenticity in America.  Like the narrator of J.D. Salilnger's  The Catcher in the Rye , we've realized, if only subconsciously, that the world we've created around us is now artificial and fake.  The whole of our economy is centered around feeling better than the next door neighbors.  God bless the Chicago Cubs.  They've finally made it into the baseball playoffs.  The Chicago Cubs are one of those n'erdowell teams that always seems to fall short of expectation.  They're the proverbial bad news bears team of the major baseball league.  Though the Chicago Cubs never win, they endear because they manage to balance diehard persistence, and yet don't lose their sense of proportion.  They maintain their lighthearted charm.  The Chicago Cubs are the real deal.  They're a class act of underdogs.  A recent opinion essay in  Time  magazine made note of this very lack of proportion and lighthearted charm in another losing team, the Detroit Tigers.   Hailing from another Midwest industrial city, the Detroit Tigers have ecclipsed the 1962 New York Mets to become the losingest team in major league baseball history.  Unlike the 1962 New York Mets, the players on the Detroit Tigers seem to have the attitude that they've been dealt a raw deal and a bad hand, that they somehow deserved better.  They take themselves very seriously.  The Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers are lightyears apart in authenticity.  It's much easier to be a fan of the Chicago Cubs.  That's why I like restaurants like Taco Bell.  You know very well when you walk into a Taco Bell that you're getting Americanized fast food.   Even though the chain has in the past used a sales slogan which encourages you to "run for the border," Taco Bell's authenticity is only parody.  There's little real pretense of them being something they are not.  That's why I shy away from restaurants that have joined the latest trend of marketing authentic foods.  You can't buy class.  You can't buy character.  You can make artificial attempts, but you can't buy the real thing.  As profound as it sounds, "Only the real thing can be real."  Which is why I love the Chicago Cubs and will eat at Taco Bell.  They don't put on aires they aren't entitled to.  They seem more real to me than any imposter labeling itself as "authentic" could ever hope to.

						    AUTUMN IN THE AIR   The brisk air of the fall weather that has come is refreshing.  Its coolness is almost a pleasant change the lazy days of summer.  In the fields, it's time to harvest what was sewn.  The cool air seems to promise magical healing properties of the cryogenic winter to come.  Like a sigh after a night of long dreaming, the cool air represents the natural, and inevitable conclusion of a God-given year.   Drops in temperature signal a biological change in the trees.  The sustained drop in temperature tells the trees that the summer season is over.  On the branch of every tree in the all homesteads, wooded areas, and ditches, thousands of leaves have played in the sun.  It's a partnership. Both leaf and tree benefit from the other.    Communication is the lifeblood of any relationship.  Cut the communication and the relationship slowly fades away.  If there is no communcation, there is no relationship.   Because of its high surface area, water is constantly evaporating from the leaf, which draws water from the moisture in the soil through the roots, the trunk, the branches, and finally into the leaf to replenish its loss.  Each leaf survives only by the moisture and nutrients which the tree allows it to have.  The leaf, in turn, does for the tree what the tree cannot do for itself.  It converts solar energy to chemical energy for the tree.  As the tree gives the leaf water, so the leaf gives the tree food.  So long as the tree gives the leaf water, the leaf gives the tree food.  When the weather seems to cool and it seems to the tree that the leaf is no longer useful, the tree decides its relationship with the leaf is finished.  It dispatches woody cells to block the artery carrying moisture into the leaf.  Moisture continues to evaporate from the leaf.  Without replenishment, the leaf begins to wither and becomes brittle.  As the environment drains the lifeblood out of the leaf, the leaf displays the valued shades of orange and red and brown that were there all along, but out of sight.  This display of beauty is too little, too late for the leaf.   Because the leaf is now brittle, it tenuously holds to the tree.  It waits for a brisk fall wind to sweep it from its former home and carry it to another, ready for transformation into another life-giving leaf for another branch in another season.  Lesson to be learned?  A relationship is like the partnership between the leaf and the tree.  If you want to keep it, communicate.  Nearly all relation maladies can be healed by the act of open communication.  But... the moment you cut off communication, perhaps influenced by a new environment, woe be to your relationship. The relationship begins to wither until it is no more.  The leaf's connection to the tree severs and soon it leaves to join with another tree.    For a tree and a leaf, the lifeblood is moisture.  For a relationship, the lifeblood is simply communication.  If you would keep a relationship alive, you must communicate as frequenly as possible in whatever forms available.    To end relationships, cut off the communication.  They will fade away from memory nearly as quickly as they came.  That's life.  It's fall, so thousands of trees all over North America have already made their decision.  Thousands of men and women all over North America  today have reached a similar decision in their relationships.  In the end, it's not all that important to the grand scheme.  Nature can be resisted but not held back.  Winter comes to us all.

						    BEER GUTS ARE NOT ALL BAD OR WHAT I LEARNED FROM SITCOM DADS   When faced with a difficult decision, the cliche advice from nearly every sitcom father to his son is to, "Go with your gut, son."  The advice is to follow instinct.  How true this is.  And yet how difficult.  We humans are given free will over our actions.  Because some instincts may warn of things benign, we can train our instincts away.  Eyelids blink repeatedly when foreign objects are placed near to protect the eye.  Thousands if not millions each year excersise their right of free will by training their eyelids not to blink when putting in contact lenses, because contact lenses are virtually harmless and are not a threat to the eye.  Triune brain theory suggests that the reason we can do this is because our brains are really composed of three layers that evolved over time.  These layers are the reptillian, limbic, and neocortex.  The reptillian brain, situated at the base of the brain stem, is responsible for life support and survival reflexes.  The limbic brain, a mammalian development,  is responsible for emotional development and explains why dogs and cats can tell when you're having a bad day and why your lizard cannot.  The latest and greatest development is the neocortex, which humans share with primates, those apes and monkeys and chimpanzees that are strikingly similar to us.  The neocortex is responsible for logic and other higher-order skills.  The exact mechanics of how it all works together, scientists are still not certain.  The human brain is a puzzingly complex organ.    Our limbic brains allow us to live in communities without killing eachother and our neocortex brains allow us to create wonderful things like contact lenses. Somewhere within this tangle of neurons, the gut feeling that sitcom dads talk about comes in.    Much of the time, going against our gut instinct is relatively harmless, like putting a finger in our eye to deposit a contact lense, but not always.  Our gut instinct is sometimes alerting us to a danger in our environment that is very real.   In a local establishment, listening to a "beer gut" may steer you away from the reef.  According to Gavin De Becker in  urlLink  The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence  , almost every victim of a violent crime had a gut feeling that some danger was lurking prior to the actual event.  Hairs rose on the back of their neck and there was a sense that something was wrong.  And in nearly every case, utilizing training they might have gained repeatedly sticking fingers in their eye, they ignored it.  Motivated by social skills rooted in their limbic brains, they rationalized with their neocortex brain that there was no danger or that to take action based on the urgings of their reptillian brain would be impolite or rude.  Balancing the intuition and logic of the limbic and neocortex with the "gut instinct" of the reptillian brain is a skill that requires cultivation.  Sitcom dad's advice is right in many situations.  If ever you go to such a place as a local establishment, you might do well to go with the advice of your favorite sitcom dad and follow your gut instinct.  This might be wise even if it means leaving said local establishment earlier than polite with present company.    Did I leave the local establishment early this evening for no good reason?  I don't know.  Sitcom advice and a gut gained from beer might just have saved my life.

						    IGNORANCE IS BLIGHT   OR   STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES   I got a whiff of true evil this evening and it wasn't pleasant: ignorance.  In my book, ignorance differs from everyday stupidity.  Your everyday stupid is just due to a lack of knowledge, a general lack of awareness.  Your everyday stupid accepts his or her limitations and is grateful for those that have been given greater gifts, because they benefit all.    Ignorance is different.  Ignorance is true ugliness.  Ignorance is jealousy.  Deep at its root, ignorance knows that it has been judged and found lacking.  Ignorance seeks to tear down what it doesn't understand.  To the ignorant, virtue makes them ashamed of themselves.  Their only defense mechanism to a feeling they cannot cope with is to lash out in violent ways.  Virtue makes the ignorant feel their wretched ugliness.  What the ignorant do not understand is threatening to them, and what is threatening, they must kill.  Beauty is knowledge of the universe.  Beauty is virtue.  Beauty is truth.  We the ignorant destroy beauty because we do not know better.  We destroy beauty because we are jealous and ashamed of how ugly beauty makes us feel.  If only the ignorant could appreciate beauty without finding it threatening.  If only the ignorant could understand that this beauty is a gift from God...  that God has not judged those with beauty in all its varied forms as more worthy, but has rather given them a gift for the benefit of all.    If only the ignorant could be made to understand.  If only jealousy could be converted to admiration of gifts differeing.  If only vindictiveness and violent tantrum could be converted to cooperation.    There's some truth to the old tongue-in-cheek expression, "It's not easy being beautiful."  Truth be told, it's downright dangerous.

						    CONCRETE AND LOCAL ESTABLISHMENTS   After getting a busy signal earlier tonight, I drove out for the night to visit a couple of old friends at a local establishment.   With my partial loss of wisdom last week, I obtained, albeit only temporary, a more concrete reason not to partake.    While on the subject of concrete and local establishments, if you want to see bad drivers, a local establishment is a good place to start.  It's not that a local establishment creates bad drivers.  I think it's just that a greater-than-average number of bad drivers accumulate there.  These bad drivers are not necessarily dangerous drivers in the physical sense, though that often results from activities at local establishments.  Drivers who are bad in my sense of the word are bad at driving on the road of life, an abused metaphor.   urlLink Some  want  to make life a highway and ride it.  At local establishments, everyone wants to ride it all night long.  But often, and often as a result of partaking, they don't ride it well.  Too often they crash.  To reach any goal worthy of achieving, we must stay on the road.  Some think staying in a committed relationship is a worthy goal.  The road is high, the gutter is low.  It takes little distraction  to veer off the road and crash into the gutter or to take out another car.  It takes little effort to be unfaithful.  I think greatest in danger to staying safely on the road are the other drivers.  When they drive dangerously, their example can cause us to get involved in a crash, and never to reach our goal.  Applied to relationships, when we see others who are unfaithful, we too are affected. We distrust our partners, and we start to think that it's not so bad if we, too, are unfaithful.  We become jealous and think that we too could be having fun being reckless with our driving.  The more careless driving we see, the worse we drive, and the more likely we are to crash.  Every action we take affects those around us.  Being around bad drivers can cause us to crash.  Our bad driving can actually cause others around us to lose faith and to crash.  The examples we set can cause other to leave the road and fall into the gutter.  In relationships, faithfulness is faith to eachother.  It is faith that the other person is as committed to you as you are to them.  I saw things tonight I would rather not have seen.  I saw others bound for trouble.  When we see others who are unfaithful, it can make us doubt the faithfulness of those we are committed to.  Bad driving causes accidents.  Thankfully, I think I'm still between the white lines and headed down the highway.  Displays of bad driving did not spook me too much tonight, although I'm still not sure whether I've developed a sudden urge to take up sculpting as a hobby.

						    PYGMALION   You're perfect.  Now change to be just like me.  This is a phenomena in relationships called the "Pygmalion Project" by some after the greek myth of   urlLink Pygmalion .  In this myth, a sculptor chisels in ivory his ideal of the perfect woman, who is later brought to life.  Men and women do the same thing in relationships.  We find people who represent to us  urlLink diamonds  in the rough, just waiting for us to polish them into a perfect form for no one but ourselves.  Although  urlLink Professor Higgins created a fair lady out of Eliza Doolittle , men and women are not diamonds in the rough waiting to be polished by their partner.  Men and women are not blocks of ivory just waiting for the right partner to sculpt them.  Many attempt to polish their chosen " urlLink diamond ."   Many play the game.  Few win.  Few are happy after winning.    When meeting frustration and resistance in their efforts to sculpt and polish, many decide that they have chosen the wrong block of ivory and the wrong diamond.  We can't ask people to be what they're not. We can't ask from people to give of themselves what they have not  been given.  We can't ask an eagle to be a lion, or a man to be a calf.  If we say we love someone, we don't try to push them into changing into something they're not.  If we want to do this, we might as well say, "I'm not too fond of you as you are right now, but I'm wild about the person I think I can turn you into." If this be our case, we might as well drop the love bit, buy a bottle of brandy, and drink to oblivion, because we're not going to win.  Leopards can't change their spots and zebras can't very well wish away their stripes.  Given the choice, I'd like to stick with the love bit, please.

						    JAZZ AND LIQUOR MADE ME DO IT.   I awake this morning with a slight taste of blood in my mouth from the tooth removed yesterday.  As I pass a mirror going to the bathroom, I see that the area around the site of my now-gone tooth has swelled some during the night.  I decided to stop taking painkillers last night and this morning, surprisingly, the pain is still nothing like that of lovesickness.  It seemed fate wouldn't let the last night pass without my seeing "Chicago."  My parents ended up waiting for me to start it.  To me, "Chicago" almost is painful to watch, not just for the memories it stirs up.  In the end, the three "good" people in the movie get punished and most of the less scrupulous get rewarded.  The prosecuting lawyer gets implicated by the defense lawyer in court for falsifying evidence that the defense lawyer later admits to his client.  Katrina Helsinki, the only innocent woman on death row becomes the first woman to be hung in Chicago.  Ironic.  Amos Hart, faithful to his wife to the end, albeit naively, is left alone in an empty court room, invisible to the world.  The phrase repeated throughout the film is, "That's Chicago."  What does "That's Chicago" mean?  It seems to represent the never-ending, never-satisfying search for the latest glitz and glamour.  "Jazz and liquor" is the excuse given by Roxie Hart as the reason she got into a situation where she had an affair and committed by murder.  "Jazz and liquor" is the excuse given to her by her lawyer, but she ever becomes self-conscious or remorseful of it in the movie, seemingly because she really likes the "Jazz and liquor" of Chicago.  Roxie Hart describes her husband, Amos this way:  "Sometimes I'm down  Sometimes I'm up  But he follows 'round  Like some droopy-eyed pup  He loves me so  That funny honey of mine!"    The verdict from Roxie Hart is in: She likes jazz and liquor, not "droppy-eyed pups."  Roxie Hart believes that it's more important to be flashy than to be faithful.  It's ironic.  Roxie Hart says at the beginning of the film that if Amos ever fooled around on her, she'd throw him a "party" and at the same time, she dismisses him because he doesn't have "the smarts."  Roxie Hart makes this statement hypocritically in a scene where she shoots a furniture salesman she herself was having an affair with.  Though Amos is faithful to her to the end, she leaves him alone in the courtroom at the end of the movie.    Amos Hart, invisible to the world, seems most satisfying as an ending.  True good is good for the sake of being good, not for any flashiness or reward.  Because there are so many flashy distractions in the world, it seems that true good often goes unnoticed.  Even flashy things are quickly discarded for the newest sensation to catch the eye.  That's Chicago, we're told.  Anything hot today is just a quick "flash in the pan," and quickly forgotten.  This morning takes me down the road to the Living History Farms.  The forecast:  a little less jazz and a little less liquor.  The question yet remains:  Is she in another castle?  I'll be thinking of this search for a queen while going down the open road.  ...To be continued...

						    CHICAGO   It waited for me on the rental rack of the local small-town convenience store.  Strange, because my father had been in search of it for several weeks.  Both my parents had made clear to me that very night that it was the movie they wanted to watch this lonely Friday evening.  "Chicago."  I paid for it at the counter along with a full tank gas for the car I drove in.  As I left out of town, the gray Dodge "Sports" Dynasty I drove told me with rumbles from its  transmission that there were serious problems between it and I.  Things like this always seem to happen to me.  I invest fully of myself just to have the whole works break down before my eyes.    The night is thick with memories.  I drive the very car from our first date.  Laying on the passenger seat is the movie, "Chicago" that we saw in the theater another one of our early dates.  And, not unlike our relationship, the car is all but  broken down.  The gray Dodge "Sports" Dynasty  is gracious and limps home to the house on the hill.  Thank God!  I drop the movie off at my parents' request for them to watch and then head downstairs to type this blog.  I don't feel like being around people right now.  On the telephone, I called her tonight.  I could bear no longer the absence of her voice.  The answering machine picked up.  My heart sank as I listened to another guy's voice explain what "fun" she and her two roommates were having.  Selfishly, I could only imagine where the "fun" would lead.  Charitably, I was glad she had found a place where she could have a good time.  Tonight I am a little less wise.  What am I doing in on a Friday evening?  This afternoon I had a wisdom tooth removed.  It is interesting to learn that getting a tooth removed is less painful than lovesickness.  You can take pain killers for getting a tooth removed, but nothing cures an aching heart.  There is no anestesia for that.  My cousin who is in town visiting, tells me that women just do not like the lovesick puppy.  Perhaps pain is my reward for waiting.  He also told me that we needed to play Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo.  More memories.  One of my secret mottos used to come from Super Mario Brothers.  Whenever I was having bad luck in finding good women, I would tell myself, "It's ok, our princess is in another castle," just like in SuperMario Brothers at the end of every kingdom.  When I met her, I was ecstatic, because finally, I told myself, I had found my princess.  Perhaps I was looking for the wrong thing.  I'm not looking for a woman to be my princess, I am looking for a woman to be my queen.  And as the night goes on, I will continue asking myself the question, "Is my queen in another castle, or have I already found and lost her?"  ...To be continued...

						    ONE FOR THE ROAD   In a long automobile trip, the autombile becomes a steel and glass manmade cage.  Drivers long for that moment when the trip comes to an end and they can escape their chosen exile.  Automobiles are wonders of technology, but not always.  They're not wondrous when necessity requires spending excessive time in them alone.    Automobiles are much more enjoyable with a partner, preferably a partner you can hold hands with and perhaps even steal a kiss from at a red light or stop sign.  Woe be not unto the driver with more than time on his hands.  Of course, buses and trains are preferable to automobiles, provided you're not playing chauffer or conductor.  If your lips get tired, you can talk to friends on the bus, or play exciting games like Egyptian Ratscrew, War, Go Fish, Crazy Eights, Kings in the Corner, Ukre, Yukon, or even Uno.  You can get up and try the padding of different seats in different locations.  I'm told that some trains even have sleeper cars which are all the better for kissing.  Unfortunately, the commercial sleeper bus is still a luxury for all but rock and roll rockers and sports announcers  If you're shrewd, you can convince a friend to drive you in your automobile, even if you're not a rock and roll rocker or a successful sports announcer.  If this be your case, automobiles are indeed wondrous after all.  You can go more places in an automobile: places off the layed down track or highway, away from the Circle K.  You can go to exciting places like parks and country gravel roads.  If you've a friend to drive you, it's all the better.  You don't have to steal your kisses at stoplights.  Lonliest is driving alone, with nary a soul to hold onto.  Drivers do themselves a favor when they find a partner for the road.

						    A COOKING LESSON   A watched pot never boils, they say.  That's not true.  The water in a watched pot will boil.  They should say that watching a pot and waiting for it to boil is a waste of time.  It will boil when it damn well pleases.  There are better ways than watching to bide time while waiting for a pot to boil.  Kissing is always good while waiting for a pot to boil.  Kissing is preferable to household chores like sponging the linoleum or dusting the ceiling.    You can kiss for a short time or for a long time.  You can kiss anywhere.  And because kissing is such a pleasant way to bide time, when the pot is ready to boil, you will forget whether you were kissing for a short time or for a long time.  You will only remember that you were kissing.  When the pot is boiling water, you can throw in whatever it is you need to throw.  Spaghetti is preferable to potatoes.  Potatoes cause a mess when you throw them at the wall whereas spaghetti is neater.  There's also a clever rationalization for throwing perfectly good spaghetti at the wall: when it sticks, it's ready.  If you make spaghetti with a pot of boiling water, you need to make a sauce while waiting for the pot to boil.  Sauce balances spaghetti very well.  Without balance, the universe becomes unhinged.  The spaghetti is bland, the sauce is the flavor.  The spaghetti is the firm and unyielding substance, the yin.  The sauce is the warm and receptive spice, the yang.  The spaghetti is unimaginative, the sauce begs for creative license.  Some people are creative enough that they should not be allowed to cook without a license.  It's possible to become so creative that the meal becomes unbalanced and the universe comes off hinge.  This would lead to abolute chaos.  For the sake of the entire universe, it's perhaps preferable to make potatoes with your pot of water, even if they do make a mess when you throw them at the wall.  They also free up your time for kissing.  Melted butter takes much less effort than sauce.    In my opinion, the best way to bide time while while waiting for a pot to boil is to kiss.  Kissing is certainly better than watching a stupid pot, and it's good for the universe, too.

						    CHICAGO STORY   Only a team from Chicago could lose this way.  The Chicago Cubs led the Florida Marlins in the National League Baseball pennant and were four outs away from the World Series when victory was seemingly snatched out of their hands by a greedy fan who grabbed over the railing for a ball, preventing the third out of the eighth inning.  Instead of a ticket bound for the world series, the Florida Marlins came back, ready to fight another game.  And in the next game they full advantage of their opportunity and smote the Cubs.  So close... and yet so far.  It's much easier to blame the thoughtless fan who grabbed for the ball than to blame the team.  He's also a lot easier for retributing frustrations that were palpable from Wrigley Field.  Emotions ran high this week.  So much was hoped for and the reality didn't live up to so much that might have been.  It's a common tale.  Funnycide, another underdog, won the first two legs of the Triple Crown, but lost it on the third.  A hundred thousand people at the horserace that day were witness to another self destruction so close to the finish line... and yet so far.  It's disappointing when you get so close to something, only to see it fall apart before your eyes, but it happens everyday.  Real life is a disappointment to our expectations.    Nothing's perfect.  And if it was, would we really want it that way?  Fighting battles that we may lose is part of the interest and intrigue of this world.  If the end was guaranteed at the start, we could sink back in a mindless apathy knowing that we had really missed nothing at all.  But it's the uncertainty that keeps us playing the game, the hope that maybe next year, the Chicago Cubs will go to the World Series.  If you want a game that has a decided outcome, watch Professional Wrestling or a Soap Opera.  If you want a game where either side could win, go to Chicago, look for the bad news baby bears, and maybe there you'll find a Cub fan who can tell you all about the virtue of persistance and unfailing optimism.  Maybe next year, Chicago.

						    KEEPING UP APPEARANCES   A fair number of people belong to religious groups because it looks good.  They're there because it's necessary to be there to play the game.  When asked their religious preference (because it's a preference now), they proudly proclaim their membership, like belonging to a club.  It doesn't matter that they go to this "club" infrequently, or or that they look down at people who go more regularly as one would look down at sheep led into a corral, it only matters that they belong.  It's only about keeping up appearances.  Why this need to keep up an appearance of being good?  In today's anonymous society, no one really cares about anyone else anyway, so why the need to keep up pretenses of being "good?"  What is the draw?  This brings me hope, because there must be good still remaining in the world. Deep down (way deep down in some cases), these people that are concerned only with keeping up the appearance of having a religious "preference" must know that good exists in the world, even if they choose not to practice it.  And where people still know good, there's still hope.  God once destroyed an entire city because he could not find as many as ten good people living inside it.  These people keeping up appearances need to be prayed for, because there is still hope for them... and because our survival as a society is in some small obscure way, linked to them.  It's not just about saving their skin, it's about saving ours as well.  It's written that God didn't agree to one good person, he agreed he wouldn't destroy the city if he found ten good people.  We're all in this boat together.  These people working hard to keep up their appearances are missing a forest for mere trees, but all is not lost.  I'm hoping eventually they remember seeing enough trees in their life's travels to realize there's a forest hidden in there, too.

						    THE ANSWER TO PAULA COLE'S QUESTION   Paula Cole asked in her hit song, "Where have all the cowboys gone?"  After reading about the  urlLink ladder theory , I have seen the light.  Women don't really want nice cowboys.  The legendary cowboy is noble but has nothing but his horse and saddleblanket.  Most women are looking for rich, drunk alcoholics who will abuse and ignore them.'  So, if a nice cowboy wants a nice girl, he must absolutely become a rich, drunk asshole and then mistreat and ignore her.  In this fine country we call the U.S. of A., I guess the lesson learned is that I as an American male must mistreat and ignore all women around me before they will find interest in me.  It doesn't make sense to me, but I guess that's the way the biology works.  This will leave another woman like Paula Cole wondering where have all the cowboys gone.  Actually, it leaves women like Paula Cole wondering where have all the straight cowboys gone.

						    MANHANDS   Sometimes it's hard to concentrate on something, but it's damn near impossible  not  to think of something.  The harder we work at pushing a thought out of our minds, the harder it works at pushing back in.  In relationships, I call this the "Seinfeld Syndrome."  In the comedy television show,  Seinfeld , the main character Jerry Seinfeld goes through a revolving door cast of women who would seem perfect for any other man, but just seem to have small quirks that drive Seinfeld crazy.  The more he tries not to think of what disturbs him, the more he is disturbed until finally he breaks up with the proverbial great woman because he is  obsessed  with the thought that her hands are too much like a man's.  It's a vicious cycle in relationships.  If we don't say anything, but try to push it out of our minds, we just think of it more.  If we do say something, the more we pick and nag, the more that particular aspect of a person's character or appearance or behavior disturbs us.  The more it disturbs us, the more we pick and nag.  I think the solution is to acknowledge the thought, but to accept it and not make a big deal of it.  It will leave as quickly as it came if a big fuss is not made over it.  And through this patented treatment system, even you can date a woman with manhands.

Take inventories of perceived faults. 2.   Trumpet your own perceived virtues. 3.   Reject affection.  Focus your own affections elsewhere. 4.   Focus on being the center of everyone's attention, all the time. 5.   Avoid personal responsibility. 6.   Don't listen. 7.   Don't be available or supportive. 8.   Don't be honest or straightforward. 9.   Cut off communcation. 10. Don't accept differences.  Don't accept or like them as they presently are. 11. Boss. 12. Make attempts to change people other than yourself. 13. Insult and belittle, often. 14. Become dependent.* 15. Don't be faithful.  *Actually used in the movie.

						    BLIND INTERSECTION   We have built a disposable world around us.  Convenience is the driving force and building lasting works is lost art.  Unfortunately, we are directly affected by the environment we construct around us.  Infrastructure not built with a future in mind causes us not to think with the future in mind.  Things we build not thinking of the future will in a short time leave behind a stink we wish not to be witness to.  The way we build our infrastructure has a direct effect on the kind of relationships we cultivate and the way in which we care for them.  Like the infrastructure around us, relationships are built a brick at a time, day by day, and week by week.  We are what we build and leave behind us.  When we build carelessly, we live carelessly.  Building only for the short term causes destructive effects in the long term.  When the future is discarded, why bother building lasting relationships with those around us?  Of course there is today, and today is the only moment we live in.  The past is gone and the future is intangible.  We cannot waste time worrying about the future, but planning for it is a task for today.   If there is no hope of a future, there is no use planning for it or building anything that will last into it.  To believe in a future one can live in, one makes hope real by planning for it today.    It's a trick to balance planning the future and truly living the present.  The future, if we believe there is one, will supply only more present moments.  If we only plan and never enjoy, there's no more advantage than living only in the moment.   When there is no future, there is no sense in putting passion into our life's work.  Passion is the wind that fills the sails that provide the power propelling us to the next moment.  Without passion, the sails luff and  we drift aimlessly with the current.  Quality is of no use because in the next moment the present will be swept away without memory.  To not plan is to declare that one lives in a world where there is no hope, where there is no future, where everything that a life is filled with means nothing.  Planning is the rudder that controls our direction.  If there is a future, our lack of a rudder will catch up to us eventually as the ship that is our soul runs aground on the rocks.  We bear witness to a past future whose crumbling institutions I hope predicates not our very own.  Were we to lose hope, we'd stop fighting and live only for the moment, but believe we must and in doing so we plan.  In planning we introduce passion to a work filled with building quality relationships meant to last.  In protecting passion and minding the planning, we work to keep on course and avoid running aground on a hostile shore.  In protecting passion and minding the planning, a bearable future able to be lived in can still be hoped for.  At the blind intersection that is the present, it's a coin flip whether fate will judge all our planning null and void, completely futile, but to not to slow down and listen and look both ways invites pain and misery for all involved.

						    VALIDATING TICKETS FOR THE LOVE TRAIN   A recently published book called,  urlLink Who's Looking Out for You?  by Bill O'Reilly advocates filliing your life with good people.  It advises people to be careful who they associate with.  The decision, it's noted,  can bring you much pleasure or much sadness.  By Bill O'Reilly's logic, if who we choose to love is not looking out for us, we set ourselves up for perpetual pain and misery.  There will be no forseeable end to the agony of choosing a partner who does not love in return.  Conversely, if we choose a partner who loves us in return, what joy is there to be had.  Saint Francis de Sales says that in an effort to please that which we love, we gradually become more like the object of our affection.    By choosing a partner who truly loves us, we love ourselves.  We invest in that who we love.  When we love another who loves us too, that love is doubled in its return.  When two people truly love each other, there is no end to the good works which they can accomplish together.  It is said that all the world's a stage and that we are merely players.  This is true, but no mortal is cast in the role of director, nor can everyone be a star of the production.  When we cast ourselves as the star of the play, we can be tempted to criticize the performance of those around us.  This may lead us to a desire to cast ourselves in the role of director for other people's lives when other's acting does not suit us or benefit us personally.  Doing so, we unconsciously create resentment in those around us and we are quite surprised when they unwittingly retaliate.  An actor or actress casting themselves in the role of star and snubbing those around will soon find themselves starring more and more alone after the supporting cast in their life mutinies.  By choosing to love people who do not love us back, we set ourselves up for a life of pain and sadness.  If we choose  to love people who truly return our love, we just might have a shot at happiness in this lifetime.  Of course, nothing is guaranteed and without pain there is no pleasure, but there are magnitudes to suffering.   And, if all of this is true, was Mother Theresa any less true when she said, "I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts, then there is no hurt, but only more love."  It has also been said by the eminent writer, Kahlil Gibran that for those who would choose only love's pleasure, it is better for them that they not love at all.   It has been said by the psychiatrist M. Scott Peck, author of  The Road Less Traveled  , that the measure of a man's greatness is his ability to withstand pain.  Perhaps both Bill O'Reilly and Mother Theresa are right at the same time.  Mother Theresa, now canonized, is on the fastrack to sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church.  She set an outstanding example of humanity, but the majority of us other humans cannot live up to her example.    So, for those of us with lower thresholds of pain, perhaps Bill O'Reilly's advice is somewhat wise.  Find people who love and accept you.  Find people who aren't using you as a means to their own ends.  Find people who don't compile lists of your flaws and imperfections.  Find people who enjoy your company.  Find people who like giving to other people as much as you do.  Perhaps it all depends on the size of our love train (meaning our capacity to love, not a part of the male anatomy).  For everyone we let on our love train, someone else is excluded.  Why fill a train with rude, obnoxious passengers who speak harshly, criticize the decor, complain about the route, and destroy the interior when you could instead fill it with more pleasant company?   While spending your time on courteous people may not lead you to sainthood, it might just lead you to sanity.

						    BRACE YOURSELF   Brace yourselves for a shocking truth:  No matter how hard we try, we are not God.  Unbelievable, I know.   But it's true!  Before we knock ourselves down too much for not being able to live up to the lofty goal of perfection, we must admit to ourselves that we are not God, nor that as hard as we can try, we will never be.  We must settle instead for God's presence, God's company, and the desire to do God's will as best we can.  God doesn't expect us to be God. God doesn't feel insulted when we don't live up to God's perfect expectations. We're only expected to admit when we fall short to ourselves and to God.  The only penalty comes when we try to hide the truth... and when we work to prevent others who seek it from finding it.  Shocking truth, granted, but it's true!  You were forewarned.  I hope you were braced.

						   What has been learned here thus far?  Hunters hunting male deer use scent bombs which mimic the scent of female deer.  Luckless male deer are drawn to the scent bombs, looking to mate, but only finding themselves to be sacrificed to the tastes of the food chain.  Human males, with their reckless behavior to impress, and their instinctual draw to the female form can be just as luckless as hunted male deer.  Human females, if they target a human male, can be every bit as cunning and seductive as deer hunters, although they don't necessarily need to be.  Males have not gotten stereotyped for their seeming inability to resist seduction for no reason.  Is any of this bad?   No.  It's just the way things are.  Perhaps more time should be spent writing bad essays.  It's safer than getting lured into a trap by a hunter's scent bomb.

						    FEAR AND LOATHING IN MINNESOTA   There's a certain apprehension involved with getting into or getting back into a relationship.  What does the future hold? Are we ready for the future?  Are we ready for all the situations and possibilities and decisions this relationship might lead us to?  Fear is lack of faith, a lack of belief that the world will be just as it should.  Fear places that belief instead on worry, as if with our worry we could will an entire world to be not as it should.  We all fear the future and what it holds in store for us.  With morbid curiosities we look and try to discern distant smoke which signals times of misery we'd rather avoid.  But the world will be just as it should.  With all our will we cannot hold back the force of the world.  Events will take their course on stage.  We are not the directors of this play, we are only actors.  For us, it is not our assignment to direct the play but to act our role, to know our lines.  The script is written, whether or not we bite our fingers or chew our toenails.  We can choose how we deliver our lines, but we cannot choose the lines that have been given us by the director.  So we should trust, fear not, and seek only to play well the roles that have been given us.  Paraphrasing Kahil Gibran's words from "The Prophet," we can't direct the course of love, for if love finds us worthy, it will direct our course.   It is not possible to make a mistake.  The writer long ago scripted and approved our actions.  We only need listen for direction from the director.  We've already passed the audition.  Developing a case of butterflies in the course of delivering our lines is as fruitful as chewing our toenails.   It's time to stop chewing toenails and to dive back in.  The future does not belong to us.  Will there ever be a better time than now?

						    FAIRY TALE ENDINGS   Once we had fairy tales.  Now we have Hollywood.  Hollywood is our fairy tale land.  Unfailing belief in our fairy tale land has left many of us adults with child-like beliefs.  One perpetuating fairy tale of our Hollywood is that for every man and woman in the world, there is a perfect romantic soulmate.  It's just a matter of finding them.  This romantic fairy tale has become an ideal.  Myths are by definition false, and when the false is taken as true, the stage is set for pain.  In Hollywood myth, if your partner is indeed your true perfect romantic soulmate then you will live a blissful fairy tale existence and never encounter hard times.  If your relationship isn't blissful, too bad, "You must have screwed up!"  "Better luck next time!"  Myths are false.  What's false causes pain.  A relationship in which two people never disagree is false.  A relationship in which two people never disagree with eachother only leads to pent-up resentment and delays disagreement to another day.    Disagreement is inevitable.  If we spend enough time with someone, it will happen.  The key is in how we move from disagreement to agreement.    Argument is a key part of resolving disagreement.  That a couple argues is not a crime.  That a couple fails to respect eachother through argument is.  Respect throughout an argument is the key to solving disagreements constructively on solid ground.  This is the basis of true love and not romantic fictional fairy-tale love.  This type of love takes self-discipline.  It takes love not to face the argument as a war in which the objective is to win at all costs.  The objective of an argument is to hear the view point of the other person and to respect it as valid.  The objective of an argument is to solve a difficulty so that two people can continue to get along.  Forces of the world balance eachother.  Without pain, struggle, and sadness, we lose our very ability to experience joy in good times.  We forget to recognize good times as truly good.  If we stay open and respect the good intentions of our partners, even when we disagree, then just maybe we can have successful relationships built more on the solid ground of true love and less on the false love of fictional fairy tales.

						    THE CULT OF REVERENCE    Teach children to revere that which they cannot understand. Teach them that to doubt is sin. Teach them that faith is superior to reason. Teach children these things if you will, but do not be surprised if they eventually replace your brand of irrationalism with some other. Without the guidance of a sharp, disciplined mind, they will be easy prey for whatever cult can capture their emotional fancy.   -- urlLink Ayn Rand   *****  This is a tale of four little pigs.  A litter of piglets were weaned from their mother.  After a touching baccalaureate service, they were sent out into the world by their father to make something of themselves.  The first little pig got swept up in the latest fad and built his house of  urlLink light straw.   Light straw was very popular with the other piggies, especially the lady piggies.  The big bad wolf came to visit one day and easily blew the house down to eat the little pig.  He owned a textile mill down the way and sported an attractive pullover.   Lesson:  Those who do not know why they believe what they do will become slaves of those who do.  They will buy what they are sold without question and will easily be led by anyone appearing authoritative, good or bad regardless.   The second little pig talked to a couple of friends and followed their advice to build a house of weightier  urlLink sticks.  When he asked whether sticks were big-bad-wolf-proof, they told him to trust them.  So he did.  The next day the big bad wolf came along and blew the house down, and ate the little pig.  He was seen shortly thereafter talking to the friends that had convinced the little pig to choose sticks for building material.   Lesson:  Be careful of those who tell us not to question, and just to do it!  How can we detect false prophets except by thinking?  We can shut our eyes and ears to anything new, but we can only keep out the rest of the world so long.    The third little pig thought and thought and thought and decided not to listen to anyone else.  He decided to build his house of brick with no windows.  The big bad wolf blew and blew, but couldn't get in.  It didn't matter to the third little pig, though.  He died of an lung infection caused by mold, which because there were no windows grew plentifully from the damp conditions inside.   Lesson:   If you live in isolation, you'll get sick and die just the same.  The fourth little pig thought and thought and decided to follow Mahatma Ghandi's advice:  I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides, and my windows to be closed. Instead, I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.  -- urlLink Mahatma Ghandi  He built his house of brick, but added windows and shutters to the third little pig's design.    The two friends of the second pig were last seen talking to the big bad wolf.  They'd set up an agreement where they wouldn't be eaten in exchange for advising other little pigs to build houses of straw and sticks.   When the big bad wolf came to the fourth little pig's house, he blew and he blew, but he couldn't knock the fourth little pig off of his feet.   Lesson:  Think for yourself, but don't think you know it all and shut out the world.  Of the four little pigs, only the fourth little pig succeeded in living happily ever after.  Because the fourth little pig's house was clean and dry, he lived a healthy, happy life and was able to attract a pretty young pig who hadn't been suckered by friends of the big bad wolf. And what of mother and father pig?  They lived the rest of the remainder of their shelf life as Farmer Brown's bacon and lard.   THE END

						    ENERGY WASTED ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING   We devote to our children a huge amount of our energy and resources.  If they are important to us, we want to see them do well, because at the end we want to know that our lives meant something.  We want to know that it was not all in vain.  But it is all in vain.  It says that in Ecclesiastes.  All is vanity and a chasing after the wind, it's written.  We are incapable of doing good.  It is only by the grace of God that good results from our actions.  At the end, our lives will mean something, but we are incapable of attaching that meaning.  It is God who attaches meaning to our lives.  Anything else is vanity.  We can devote to our children only the love that God has first shown us.  Glory be to God.

						    THEY´RE LIKE PETS, ONLY BETTER!    "Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but are not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.   You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.  You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, nor even in your dreams.  You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you."  --Kahil Gibran  How proud we are to see our children's hands become those of capable adults, but how arduous this process.  Guiding and imparting wisdom, it is easy to place to much restraint or not enough.  The only guide we have is our own experience.  Not trusting our children signals that we do not trust ourselves that we have raised them right.  When we lose trust in our children (and by default extension ourselves), we confine our children to the prison of our past.  We bind their hands to prevent them from making mistakes.  Like eyes that go blind in darkness, muscles that atrophy and bones that deform under constant pressure, we risk harm when we narcissistically appropriate our children's lives for our own.  Our children must be trusted to discover their own rules.  To deprive them this denies them love.

						    WHAT DOES IT ALL MEME?    "You have no choice about the necessity to integrate your observations, your experiences, your knowledge into abstract ideas, i.e., into principles. Your only choice is whether these principles are true or false, whether they represent your conscious, rational convictions – or a grab-bag of notions snatched at random, whose sources, validity, context and consequences you do not know, notions which, more often that not, you would drop like a hot potato if you knew."  -- urlLink Ayn Rand   Every time we talk to someone, watch a movie, listen to the radio, go to church, attend a class, or go to the store, we are presented with a seemingly infinite number of memes.  What are memes?   urlLink Memes  are cultural ideas that replicate.  Fashion can be used as an easy example.  Imagine that one person in a college decided to wear only underclothes to class.  Imagine this one person was a very popular person with a lot of influence.  If other students were to follow the trend, the cultural idea to only wear underclothes to class could be called a meme and could be tracked mathematically with vectors through a process called memetics.  The idea to only wear underclothes to class and other students' imitation could be tracked like the propogation of a virus.  The faster the spread, the more virulent the meme.  Memetics is the study of this spread of memes (ideas) from person to person in a society.   urlLink Content analysis  is one sociological tool which can be used in memetics to help track the spread of ideas.  Content analysis takes a work of text or film or other media and objectively categorizes the themes of ideas presented therein.  The frequency of recurring ideas are then recorded.   urlLink John Naisbitt  wrote in his book,  urlLink Megatrends  that the public conscience can really only can deal with a finite amount of issues at a time.  For instance, if an issue such as the price of gas rises in predominance, another issue such as human rights will decline in predominence.  If large newspapers were used to track the spread of ideas about a topic such as environmental waste through newspapers, memetics could use content analysis to discern how fast and in what quantity the ideas were spread.  Through the tracking of memes, content analysis could be used to track the extent to which a topic was registering on the national conscience.    It can be difficult to know why a society behaves the way it does.  Memetics can help by tracking the virus-like spread of ideas.  If memes can be tracked, their influence can be predicted and potentially corrective memes introduced.  In the information age, ideas become cheap and and the amount of them generated vast.  This can make tracking them potentially difficult.  In studying the spread of an idea somewhat obscure, it would seem that the physics Heisenberg uncertainty principle might apply.  The better known a state of an idea is, the less that can be known about its movement.  The more that is known about its movement, the less that can be known about its current state.  Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, it would seem common sense that that the movement of ideas being studied could easily be affected by a society's conscious knowledge that these ideas were being studied.  Memes can be good or bad.  There are good memes such as the cultural idea that boiling water prevents illness.  There are bad memes such as making dust masks out of asbestos material.   This principle can be used to advantage by people resisting the virulent propogation of destructive memes in their lives.  If television or radio or other influences are found to be negative, they can be shut out as a source of vector transmission.  This is the basis of the cultural idiom, "See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."  Common sense holds that if we block out vectors for bad memes to enter our minds, we help prevent ourselves from doing and spreading them.  If we cannot escape a meme's reach, the simple act of being aware can help us negate their influence and develop some immunity to their effect.  Like the immune system, it takes time to develop the skills to fight off memes.  If we start teaching children early how to analyze the things they see and hear and observe, their immunity will grow.  Going back to the introductory quotation, every action, word, and observable thing has an idea, constructive or destructive, behind it.  We form our life philosophy by ingesting countless numbers of memes throughout our lifetime.  If we study the effect of memes in our lives and whether they lead us to the truth or to the false, we are better equipped to pick up the good and reject the bad.  We need only to continue asking ourselves the question, "What does this meme?"

						    THANK GOD WOMEN DIDN´T WANT TO SEE HIM NAKED   What do women really want?  Some men think good looks while others consider the importance of meaningful jobs, money, personality, power, prestige, popularity, sexual prowess, or just being nice. Others think women prefer the guy who is the the classic asshole.  What do women really want?  Mel Gibson explored the theme in the movie,  What Women Want .  The conclusion there seemed to be that women want men who understand them and yet are trustworthy.  In  Shrek 2 ,  urlLink reviews  say that looks are indeed important but that but that the internal measure of beauty is more important than society's convention.  A friend of mine once said that women themselves don't know what they really want until age 22, if then.  Perhaps this is true.  It might take that long for women to discover their internal desires.  Maturing is not an overnight process.    It might take women even longer to learn to trust internal standards which might clash with the opinions of friends, family, and the social convention prescribed by advertisers targetting the naive young.  Indeed, advertisers work hard to set standards which are both flashy to catch attention and at the same time hard to reach.  The advocation of elite standards such as appearance, hairstyle, clothing, and build can be lucrative in their ability to get both women and men on a financial hamster wheel in which the goal is ever more ridiculous.  Current social convention is to buy what we're sold.  We'd probably be a lot happier if we took the time to decide what was important to us and ignored the pressure of social coercion.  It takes time to learn that the mob isn't always right.

						    WHERE IS JOHNNY APPLESEED?   Relationships most easily form when two distinct egos collapse into one.  Inevitably friction in the relationship will occur when the boundaries between two people re-establish themselves.  This is the proverbial end of the honeymoon.  Whether the relationship survives the inevitable return to normalcy will depend on whether both parties are willing to accept the unavoidable boundary between hate and love.  Hollywood gives up at this point.  Hollywood says that if two people cannot share one ego, they cannot possibly love eachother.  How sad.  When graviational attraction has eased to again allow separation, it can take real work to bridge the distance.  The gift of falling in love may be as simple as a comet descending from heaven, but to enjoy the fruit of love requires the work of planting a garden.  The harvest of concerted love can be every bit as intoxicating as the Hollywood variety.  Johnny Appleseed went around the country planting apple trees not out of humanistic altruism, but to provide the raw materials for the manufacture of cider.  Had Johnny Appleseed or others like him not planted the garden, there would be no apples to ferment.  Likewise, the karma of love dictates that we harvest what we plant, but that not everything we plant grows.  We have to do a lot of planting and be patient before we start to see orchards spring forth.  But the more we plant, the more fruit there is in the world to harvest.  If the entire world looks to rely on Hollywood harvesting, sweet apples for intoxicating cider will be in short supply.  If everyone wants to fall in love but not to love, true love itself will be soon be rare.

						    APPOGGIATURAS AND THE SEARCH FOR RESOLUTION   Human souls like human ears demand resolution to meaningful periods of time.  It is difficult to leave any span of time detached from all else.  Like time and musical notes, we are defined by our relations.  The people we associate with and spend time around define our place in the grand symphony.  In music, appoggiaturas are leaning or grace notes before the main note of a phrase.  Appoggiaturas highlight the human need for harmonic resolution.  These notes can show us what is missing and give us the thrill of appreciating harmony when we hear and feel it.   In order for an appoggiatura to be an appoggiatura there needs to be a note of resolution.  If some sense of resolution can be found, discordant notes can turn into the introductory notes for delightful passages.  If we can find some resolution to relationships that cause our souls discord, we can use them to highlight our longing for harmonious relationships and better appreciate the sweetness of good times.

						    HUMAN BEING, NOT GUINEA PIG   A big part of growing up is learning that we have no right to place demands on or to otherwise play games with the lives and actions of other people.  For some of us, and actually for most of us, this can be a painful lesson to learn.  As profound as it sounds, human beings are not guinea pigs to be experimented with.  This sounds so basic, so much like a kindergarten lesson, but so many adults are loathe to follow it.  Adults like children have difficulty with ethics.  For example, take drug testing.  Medical companies take human beings who happen to be poor and then use them to run drug studies.  After the study completes, it doesn't matter whether the drugs were helpful or not, the study is done and the drugs are transferred from those who can't afford them to those who can.  It doesn't matter that the poor payed for them with risk.  Drug company actions send the message that human life is cheap.  As another example, look at reality television.  Television companies bait people with money, romance, or fame in order to manipulate them into situations where the greater television audience looks on like so many ancient Romans at a gladiator spectacle.  Humanity is gone in a frenzied spectacle of "I win, therefore you must lose."  And it holds true with relationships.  When we fail to accept the autonomy of our partner, when we fail to see them as a real person with hopes, dreams, desires, motivations, and wishes all their own, we are prone to treat our partners as less than human.  When their choices conflict with ours, suddenly they can become like guinea pigs that we experiment with in order to discover better means of manipulation towards our own ends.  It can be important to occasionally take the time to remind ourselves that the people in our world are human beings and not guinea pigs to be experimented on.

						    FORGET IT!   It's been said that humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.  When we think of ourselves less, we are more open to think about other people, more specifically to think about what we can do for other people.  It is easy to fall into a pit of thinking about aspects of our lives that don't meet our warped expectations.  An antidote to the pit of despair is to stop thinking of ourself and to start thinking of the troubles of people around us, more specifically, what we can do to ease the troubles of the people around us.  What could we do to make their day just a little bit better?  This is easy with complete strangers.  It is more difficul with familiar friends and family.  Friends and family might seem to be less appreciate of any attempt we make.  But try we must to make the antidote work.  We don't help other people just to help them.  We help other people to save ourselves.    Humility is not thinking less of ourselves, it's thinking of ourselves less.  If we think of ourselves less, we're more able to forget our troubles and maybe we just might have a chance to be happy.

						    I LOVE YOU, TOO    We are never so defenseless against suffereing as when we love, never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our love object or its love. --Sigmund Freud  It seems almost unfair to say, "I love you."  It was written by Kurt Vonnegut once that saying, "I love you" is really pointless because the only expected response not hurtful is "I love you, too."  How true.  If the other person doesn't say, "I love you, too" then everything is lost.  There's not much more to be said at that point.  One person is left holding an empty paper bag and the other with the incredulous look of a motorist caught in an auto accident they didn't cause.  As Garrison Keillor might put it, the mood after giving an unreturned "I love you" is like the low feeling experienced after ordering the tuna fish sandwich when steak is on the menu.  Saying "I love you" to an unreciprocating partner is like the blind chess move that unwittingly brings the game to an sudden end by stalemate.  No one wins, but the game is over.  Time spent wondering afterwards brings to mind the Leo Tolstoy quotation from Anna Karanina that "All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."  So much was right, what ingredients were missing?  It's too late now.  This game has ended.

						    INTERSTATE TO PERDITION    Tis man's perdition to be safe, when for the truth he ought to die." -- Emerson   In trying to avoid future pain, I find my present self immobilized by it.  Have I gained anything?  I think not.  I lose what I attempt to save.  I break what I work to fix.  When I avoid pain, I only find more of it.  Such a tragedy are we who choose to lose our lives for the folly of seeking out elusive safety.  We who choose safety sacrifice passion for mediocrity.  We trade lucid reality for a monocrome existence.  We are in peril until the moment of our passing.  Any chosen exchange of truth for safety is a fool's bargain.  The price of knowing life and love is accepting the imminence of death and loss.  As the wheel spun, I stacked my chips on safety, on not feeling more loss.  My priceless fortune squandered, months of brilliant life together spat upon flashed before my eyes squinting in denial of the rising sun.  As the day burned away, my ached body limped home, away from her, away from life, away from love.  Tis my perdition.  Life and love are worth death and loss.  What suffering to learn this truth.

						   ATTRACTION AND ANGST  If we had a chance to erase bad parts of our past, would it save us any heartache?  In the movie, "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," a character played by Jim Carrey and his girlfriend played by Kate Winslet get a chance to erase the memory of their troubled relationship, but in the process discover that the memories are poignantly bittersweet and are tempted to fall back together.  A kind of psychological gravity-like attraction seemingly draws us near to people around us.   In this light, it wouldn't matter if we forgot all of the past, because we could not rid ourselves of our attractions.  It is only memory that permits us to move on without remorse.  Grief in our life is predestined.  It would happen no matter what we did.  It seems that we will refuse to grow and move on until a psychological threshold of pain is experienced.  If we would refuse to submit to pruning, we accept growth in age, but not in size.  To be human, it is impossible to live without mistake.  There are those who say one mistake will lead you to misery.  There are those who say you won't end up in misery if you try hard enough.  It is denial of our true nature that leads us to misery.  We will make mistakes and be imperfect.  If we accept our nature and admit our nature, we can move on with our strengths.  If we accept the nature of those who people our lives, we are better enabled to deal with them kindly and lovingly.  Only in a superficial world can we fathom the arrogant notion that we can live a sinless life on the planet Earth.  We will hurt and be hurt by those we love.  We can only confess and ask for mercy.  The ones who can do this have truly been given the gift of grace.  We pay for experience with our time.  If we had it to do over again, we would.  Our memories, even painful ones, contain within them the remarkable ability to equip us for growth.  If we do not hide them and accept the natures that led us there, perhaps we have a better shot at getting it right the next time around.  Maybe with a little grace, we just might make it.    Either way the story ends, we will be who we will be until we aren't, and no amount of angst will change that.    Even if we could erase the painful past from our minds, we'd only return to where our story began.

						    STAYING HERE TONIGHT    Throw my ticket out the window Throw my suitcase out there too Throw my troubles out the door I don't need them any more 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.  I should have left this town this morning But it was more than I could do Oh, your love comes on so strong And I've waited all day long For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.  Is it really any wonder The love that a stranger might receive You cast your spell and I went under I find it so difficult to leave. -- urlLink Bob Dylan   There are always other things we could do with our time.  Always.  What we do with our time is very important because we have so little of it.  Why follow schedules which are used only as a vehicle to accumulate more stuff?  I don't want to waste my time on stuff.  Why not throw the ticket out the window?  If it's important, I'll be staying here tonight.

						    PAIN IN PRIVATE     Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.   -- urlLink The Princess Bride   Of all ways, the easiest way to deal with problems is not to deal with them at all.  If we ignore them, we don't have to worry about suffering their pain.  And life is pain.  It says so in the motion picture, "The Princess Bride."    One specific way of not dealing with problems is to cut out of our lives the people who we see as causing us pain.  You'd think that by adulthood, most would have outgrown this "take my ball and go home" philosophy, but no.  Many don't put it away as a childish answer to an adult dilemna because isolation is so effective.  In the short-term, not communicating does exactly what we want it to.  With isolation in our toolbox, we don't have to face the things that trouble us.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Adults don't use isolation, because adults have a longer experience with time.  They know that troubles put away today cannot long be hidden.  Children think they can accidentally start a fire and hide in the closet until it goes away.  Adults don't.  Sadly, there are many such children in adult's bodies.  Only if two people are able to talk to eachother are they able to resolve their differences and put out the fires at hand.  Cut off the communication, go into isolation, and the fire will grow until it burns down the house.  Out of sight, out of mind, but not out of existence.

						    BALLSY BURT BACARACH  OR MAN WITH HUEVOS   By existing, we affect that which we love.  We cannot experience the richness of those we love without changing them and in the process being changed ourselves.  An assessment of risk is in order.  Could the intrinsic beauty of who or what we love survive in our company, or would we destroy it in the process of loving it?  If we would risk destruction, did we ever love?  Perhaps it is arrogance to consider selfish pleasure worth the destruction of that which we hold to our heart.  To love something is to care for its preservation.  Life changes of its own accord.  At the same time, it is also naive to think that the focus of our love will not grow and change of its own.  When more people who love someone or something, changes exhibit themselves more rapidly, because mere presence has effect.  Who is to say how much love is good and how much love is bad?  Can love be bad?  Take for example, a picturesque place with an enchanting, unpretentious culture which is easily loved.  Many people love this place and move to be near it.  In the presence of so many people drawn to its pituresque unpretentiousness, the physical, photograph appearance might still be preserved, but its culture may well be destroyed.  Everyone drawn to the picturesque place carries with them their own preferences and their own history.  Their preferences influence and dilude the culture.  Thus a soul might be destroyed by the very people who claim to love it.  When loving, we can easily damage the integrity of that which we love.  It is hard not to, because we affect by our very presence.  By existing we can't help but to affect that which we love.  That is the price we pay for living.  As a result, it is nearly impossible to experience the richness of love without affecting and in the process being changed ourselves.  There's a lot of risk involved in loving something.  Perhaps if we fear too greatly the risks of destroying our love, we best not love at all.  Burt Bacarach sang, "What the world needs now is love sweet love."  What kind of love was he talking about?  If love can be bad, maybe Burt was wrong.  Perhaps the world could now use less love, and not more.    That Burt was a ballsy man.   More love in the world might wreak the havoc of soul destruction.

						    IF THIS IS TIMBER CREST, WHERE ARE THE TREES?   Mysterious forces surround the creation of community.  As much as real estate developers would like, community cannot be manufactured.  In an information drive which seeks to know everything about everything, how communities grow is largely unknown to the greater masses.  Real estate developers give newly manufactured individual buildings happening to inhabit the same area the title of community, but this is all a lie.      Community cannot be manufactured, because communities are organic.  Organic things must be grown.  The average American farmer now grows enough food to feed  urlLink 130 people .  Because so few are growing for so many, the concept of farming organic things is unknown to many people.  There is a whole art associated with farming, which unfortunately too few Americans are familiar with.  The food in grocery stores wasn't manufactured, it was grown.    Whether you buy beef or beets, it all started with a field.  This is how things are grown in fields.  First you must find fertile soil.  You have to remove the stones.  You have to prepare and fertilize the soil with nutrients before you plant in the right season.  Next you have to monitor your crop every day for potential pests and parasites.  Lots of praying helps and if God is willing at the end of the season, you can harvest enough to make it through the winter.  None of this is easy, and this is all considering you plant in a fertile area.  Real estate developers don't make good farmers.    For those looking to create community, most real estate developers sell a fool's bargain.  While communities can spring forth from the collection of houses real estate developers sell, current fads make this occurance unlikely.  The current fad is not unlike expecting a bountiful crop from rocky soil in an arid environment.  Most current real estate developments are bad places to live and even worse places to cultivate communities.  In order for people to form communities, there must be safe places for them to gather.  This means public places like parks and private places like coffee shops.  Then they must have time to spend in these places.  In addition, there must be incentives to visit these places.  Most suburban real estate developments don't offer any of these things.  Suburban houses are in defacto isolation by the large distance between houses.  Because of the sparse population, walking between neighboring houses is discouraged.  There is no incentive to visit gathering places.  There is no time, either.  Because people in suburbs have to drive everywhere--to work, to school, to the store, to the library, the vet, to the doctor's office, or anyplace that is not their house, they have less time to spend in public places.  In addition, because they have to drive everywhere, their isolation from their neighbors is only increased.  Nothing says isolation better than a metal cage on wheels.  And as an added bonus, because everyone is driving, there is even more traffic everywhere.  So that's two strikes: isolation in the home and isolation traveling from home to elsewhere.  Because the people in suburbs have less time to spend in public spaces, there isn't much demand for public places.  Who needs a park or coffee shop that you can't walk to and don't have time to visit anyway?  So three strikes and the real estate developers are out.  The homes they build are isolated, the transportation system they peddle only perpetuates the isolation, and because everyone is isolated, it's difficult to get people together in public places that become the nucleus of true communities.  Most real estate developers would never make it as farmers.  The solution?  Walkable communities which are good places to live: places where you can walk to the library and a corner store or to the church or park.  Being within walking distance of common places is the foundation of a community.    If people are prohibited from getting together, it's very difficult to form a real community.  Modern real estate developers instinctively feel the longing for community as a need to fill, but it has been so long since they have had experience with the living, breathing thing that they no longer know how to cultivate them.  To people who yearn for the smell and touch and sight of the real, they sell an artificial buquet.  Communities cannot be manufactured, but they can be killed.  We could stand to have a few more farmers to show real estate developers how things are grown.

						    GENERAL THEORY OF DATING POWER   Most women find men who are unavailable attractive until about the age of 25 to 27.  During this time, the ball is in the women´s court for men who are basically good.  Men who are basically good are available to treat them well and therefore unattractive.  Much more attractive are  urlLink the men who blow them off  and treat them poorly.  About age 25 to 27, most women (if they have sense) grow tired of the chasing-after-unavailable-men game.  Most women at this point find relief dating the men who call when they say they will and do what they say they will.  Suddenly these men become more attractive than the men in their past who repeatedly blew them off or only used them for sex.  Women now realize that men who are basically good, men who will cherish them, men who will make time for them, are hard to find.  Women at this age find that the old adage, "a good man is hard to find" is true.    At this age, the paradigm suddenly shifts due to several market phenomeneh.  The concept of supply and demand kicks in.  As each year passes, more and more women grow tired of playing games.  At the same time, good men are taken off the market with increasing rapidity as they are snatched up by women who know good deals when they see them.  Good men, who were formerly under-valued by the dating women, are now both in high demand and at the same time in increasingly low supply.   In terms of dating power, the men who are basically good and who treat women well at age 25 to 27 now have the ball in their court.  The balance of power shifts and good men at this age now have the advantage.  They now have their pick of women who in their more youthful days would have blown them off.  Women find themselves competing amongst themselves for a hot commodity: men who are nice to them.  The forecast for dating power among good men age 25 to 27 is excellent.  The dating power of men at this age only continues to go up with age, because the number of women weary of the chase game only increases at the very same time the supply of good men continually dwindles.  Women who don't mature early may well find themselves settling for the man they desired in their youth: men who don't call, men who spend each night at the bar, and men who treat them like they mean nothing to them.  Good men are, after all, hard to find.

						   Most cultures have a concept of universal justice.&nbsp; Some call it  urlLink karma .&nbsp; Some call it the law of "what goes around comes around."&nbsp; A friend of mine believes in this, but from his experience, he thinks he needs to do about three good things for every bad thing he does.&nbsp; I think this is a half truth.&nbsp; It's true in a way, but it's not the whole story.   The law of karma says that forces are balanced.&nbsp; Every good thing will return to us and so will every bad thing we do.&nbsp; The bad thing we&nbsp;do to our neighbor today will return to us tomorrow.&nbsp; Jesus tells us to follow the golden rule of doing to others as we would have them do unto us.&nbsp; Perhaps Jesus tells us to do this because he loves us and&nbsp;what we do to others (even the bad stuff)&nbsp;will be done to us.&nbsp;   I think my friend's belief that he needs to do three good things for every bad is a half truth because it denies karma which holds that there is balance.&nbsp; The reason he needs to do three good things for every bad thing is because he is not even aware of the other two bad things he does.&nbsp; And even then he probably does not know the true extent.&nbsp; He&nbsp;knows not what&nbsp;he does.   The law of universal justice holds... for everyone.&nbsp; The bad that we do will return to us, and because all humans are to some extent bad and to some extent blind, bad will return to us whether we see it or not.&nbsp; Whether it comes back to us one for one, threefold, or tenfold depends upon how good our vision is.&nbsp; Everything in the universe is balanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;   We should be less quick to find fault in others.&nbsp; We're told in the Bible's New Testament not to point out the splinters in other's eyes when we can't even see the planks which cloud our own vision.&nbsp; Like my friend and his unbalanced karmic belief, most of us are&nbsp;unable to see&nbsp;all the bad things we do.&nbsp; In addition we are unable to correct them because we do not see the set of ugly bias and ignorance that guides our decisions.   And yet we appoint ourselves judge and juries over the decisions that other people have made.&nbsp; We are quick to find fault and slow to find merit.&nbsp; We are fast to hold a grudge and cautious to forgive.&nbsp; We are hypocrites.   In myth, Diogenes went around with a lantern during daylight hours claiming to be looking for just one honest man.&nbsp; Diogenes is said to have died without ever finding one.&nbsp; People&nbsp;in the world able to maintain&nbsp;the most critical&nbsp;voices without drawing choruses of laughter are probably the most dishonest.&nbsp; They weren't necessarily any better at not making mistakes,&nbsp;they&nbsp;just more&nbsp;shrewdly hid them from view.&nbsp; There are people in this world very good at disguising their past for other than what it was.&nbsp;&nbsp; They try to fool people into believing that they are divine, sinless&nbsp;gods.&nbsp;   These people who think themselves gods are probably some of the weakest the human race has to offer.&nbsp; I think God protects some people from seeing the effects of their own actions.&nbsp; Maybe that's what hell is reserved for.&nbsp; Or perhaps he gives the gift of grace to protect them from reaping the results of their transgressions.&nbsp; If either of these be the case, it is true gift because most humans could scarcely&nbsp;go on&nbsp;if they experienced the measure of pain they created in life.&nbsp;    (Digression:&nbsp; If we saw the true amount of&nbsp;suffering caused by ourselves, we would likely fall to the ground like dead men.&nbsp; If God chooses to save any of us for heaven, we should truly be thankful, because we know not what we do.&nbsp; As human beings, it is not in our power to earn our way to heaven.&nbsp; That power is held by something greater than ourselves.&nbsp; What human misery arises from humans who think it is their responsibility to earn a ticket to a heavenly afterlife with God of their own efforts!)    People born without noses might grow up thinking that their bowel movements don't stink.&nbsp; Their product wreaks, they just aren't conscious of it.&nbsp; It seems to me that the people most critical are either those that are born without noses or those that have the least experience because they have done the least with their lives.&nbsp; It's easy to point out imperfections and mistakes made by someone doing&nbsp;something you couldn't do yourself.&nbsp; (That's why it's very easy to blame our parents for things that are wrong in our lives.&nbsp; We couldn't have raised ourselves!)&nbsp;   Those with the clearest vision are more softspoken and less critical than the ignorant because they know that they don't have all the answers.&nbsp; They've usually also done the most because in order to get where they are, they had to take some risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth is paid for with the inevitable&nbsp;mistake.&nbsp;   Advancement of civilization depends upon how much truth can be handled and at the same time how much respect can be shown between citizens.&nbsp; There's a balance to be reached.&nbsp; The Constitution of the United States was&nbsp;successful because its framers recognized this, hence free speech and&nbsp;protection of citizens from cruel punishments.&nbsp; There needs to be enough self-criticism to improve and at the same time enough compassion to accept that humans are by nature not perfect and should not harshly be held to such a standard.&nbsp; The more highly a civilization thinks of itself, the less it sees because there are always problems that need to be corrected and things to be improved.&nbsp; At the same time the more harshly a civilization punishes its citizens for being human, the more it sinks into the depression that&nbsp;accompanies hypocrisy.   Most cultures accept the concept of justice, but they vary in balancing the seemingly paradoxical values of compassion and accountability.&nbsp; The truth is there in the world whether we&nbsp;accept&nbsp;it or not.&nbsp; Our growth stems from being able to&nbsp;see and&nbsp;handle&nbsp;it and yet not to lose our sense of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more successfully we hide hard truths&nbsp;from ourselves, the&nbsp;more we fool ourselves into believing that the world really is  urlLink the way we see it .&nbsp; While we can't earn our way to heaven,&nbsp;if we're truthful yet compassionate perhaps God will let us&nbsp;make this life just a little bit better down here on earth.

						   Women read romance novels and people in Los Angeles watch car chases.  These are two things in life which must be accepted.    According to one  urlLink report , over half of paperback fiction books sold in the U.S. are romance novels. Over one third of all fiction published and sold are romance novels. And according to another  urlLink report , approximately 93% of all romance novel buyers are female. Who the 7% of male romance novel buyers are, I don't know. Perhaps they are, in  urlLink the words of Governor Arnold Swarzenegger  urlLink  of California , "girlie men."    The plot of a romance novel generally consists of two lovers separated by an obstacle which must be resolved before they can consummate their affair. In the end, everyone who worked to keep them apart must be justly punished.     When you start a romance novel, you can almost guarantee that lovers will unite and the obstructors will be punished. The difference lies in how interesting the tale is and with what skill it is told. It makes a difference how complex the obstacles are.     A bad romance novel is not unlike a bad car chase. This is a transcript of car chase coverage aired on KCAL 9, an independent television station in L.A. on August 31, 2001:   "The suspect ah still driving ah well within the speed limit, in fact slower than the speed limit, driving very reasonably right now through the streets of southern California ... there's nobody else behind him right now. Everybody has pulled off including ah the LAPD, Hawethorne, Englewood, they are not there, nowhere to be seen. ... At this point the officers are saying that they have a really good idea of who he is, they have a pretty good idea of where he lives even, so at this point ah they're going to go ahead and let him drive home if that's what he wants to do." (According to Episode #248 of National Public Radio's "This American Life")  Later on they this was reported by KCAL reporters:   "That's one thing we've, we've certainly learned, this is a fuel efficient car, I guess just the kind you want to have in a pursuit, and ah, forgive me if I am making light of this situation, I'm not trying to do that ah and you guys know that, but for goodness sakes this has gone on as you say for four hours now and ah he has not run out of gas yet so that says a lot about the vehicle he is driving." (According to Episode #248 of National Public Radio's "This American Life") The viewer, like the romance novel reader, knows how the chase will end. It doesn't matter. No matter how calm the chase, no matter how inevitable the capture, a chase is still a chase and as evidenced by the KCAL 9 transcript, people will tune in.    Why do people read and tune in when they know what the results are going to be?   Stephen Pinker in "How the Mind Works," says that music is composed of chords which progress from stable to unstable and then back to stable. This is probably the same draw of romance novels for women and car chases for the people of Los Angeles. Initially things are good, then there's a problem, and finally we can relax again because the scene is calm once more.     Maybe this cycle of stable-unstable-stable is a human need. A small majority of romance readers are from the Midwest. Perhaps there is a small majority here because life is more stable here than elsewhere in the country. There aren't any earthquakes or hurricanes here, just a few tornadoes every once in a while. Perhaps women who are otherwise in safe, stable relationships crave a bit of instability (this was actually a subplot in one of Arnold Swarzenegger's movies, "True Lies" where a used car salesman hits on Arnold Swarzenegger's wife for that very reason).  In addition to the bored Midwestern women majority, half of all romance readers are married, a third are single, and only 10% are divorced. Married women are in generally the most stable of all relationships, marriage. Divorce women don't need instability, they've already had their fill. Why a third of romance readers are single, I don't know. Women still don't make complete sense to me.   Nevertheless, humans want to experience instability when short of it, but not really to have instability itself in their own lives. What better way to safely shake things up than reading a romance novel where the ending is certain or watching a high speed car chase where a driver has so little chance of escaping that he's driving the speed limit. Through vicarious living, the brain's desire for instability can safely be met without leaving the comfort of home.

						   So many people are searching for a soulmate and so many people are lost and disillusioned in their quest. Do people ask too much? Many people are looking for soulmates because they feel incomplete. To complete them, people look for someone to fill in their emptiness.  Soulmates, our supposedly perfect match, are often seen as our other half.    In seeking a soulmate, I think we do sometimes ask too much. No one else can complete us. If we are basically unhappy, it is not in another person's power to bring happiness to us. If there is something missing in our life, no one else can fill it. We have to take charge of being a complete and happy person in and of ourselves.    Commonly held beliefs see relationships with soulmates as supposedly effortless. If a relationship is perfect it shouldn't require any work, right? But no relationship is perfect and all relationships require work to sustain them. You can't just show up. You get out what you put in as the old cliche goes. The idea of a perfect soulmate relationship is unrealistic.     All happiness starts from within. You can't give when you don't have. Because of that, the partner who gives more in a relationship is generally happier than the partner who gives less. Being able to give is a hallmark of internal happiness. It is also a sign of being ready for committment.     Karmic laws control the universe. We can't expect to harvest flowers if we don't plant gardens. Candide learns this in Voltaire's work. In  The Optimist , Candide discovers a great solution for happiness. It all involves tending the gardens before us. Our garden is whatever life work we've found to do. Candide learns after much traveling and thinking that tending our garden keeps away the threats to happiness of idleness, want, and vice.    It's great to seek an ideal partner and companion, but we should be careful not to avoid placing our happiness upon imaginary soulmates. We get what we are able to give. Everyone likes attention. It's why so many people want to be famous movie stars. In real life, if we crave undivided attention, we must be prepared to give it. If we come off as attention deficient, we come off as desperate.     Desperation has a strange way of turning people off. If someone wreaks of desperation it sends out warning signs, because it says that they are needy and have nothing to give.    We can seek ideal partners and life companions, but we should first do a reality check that we are well and balanced. No one can do that for us, not even a soulmate.

						   In one story from the bible, Lot and his family are told to get the hell out of Dodge and not to look back.  If they look back at the raining destruction of fire befalling a city no longer good they will be destroyed themselves.  Author Kurt Vonnegut makes mention of this story in his book  Slaughterhouse Five .  Unfortunately for Lot, Lot's wife does look back and is turned instantly into a pillar of salt.  Lot can't help his wife because that would mean looking back, which would bring down God's wrath to him as well.  It happened to Lot's wife, but maybe the same thing can happen to us.  Maybe it's not best to know what happened after we left.  People have a certain amount of salt in their bodies.  If we look back, we too can be consumed by it.  Salt has been used for thousands of years as a preservative for food.  It helps shrivel meats and vegetables and keep out the bugs. Salt can do the same thing for people.    When we look back, we are inclined to question things we shouldn't waste time questioning.  As Tom Hanks' character Forrest Gump philosophizes, shit happens.  And sometimes, no amount of human reasoning can explain why the shit had to happen, it just did.  When events of the world require us to move on, it is a human desire to look back, to see if anything might be salvaged, to question why.  But it's no good.  Sometimes shit just happens, and we have to accept it and move on without looking back, not taking time to ask why.  If we look back, we are inclined to turn ourselves into pillars of salt-shriveled meat.  We can't always salvage the past or make ammends.  Sometimes it's best to leave the destroyed cities of our past to themselves and God.  Sometimes it's best to move on with the activity at hand, namely getting the hell out of Dodge and finding safer places to live, places where it doesn't rain fire.

						   What do women want?  What does anyone want?  In this essay, I continue on a  urlLink previous   urlLink blog subject  which began with the Mel Gibson movie,  urlLink What Women Want ."    Evidently Freud didn't have a clue, either.  Eminent writer,  urlLink Kilgore Trout , once said, "Sigmund Freud said he didn't know what women wanted. I know what women want. They want a whole lot of people to talk to."  Kilgore Trout might have been onto something, but he might have been right about more than women. Men may not be looking for a whole lot of people to talk to, but there are certainly a fair number of men seeking another part of themselves.  Don't believe me?  I think Tom Cruise's line, " urlLink You complete me " in Jerry McGuire didn't only strke a chord with women.  Even if Jerry McGuire is discounted as a "chick flick," it can't be denied that a fair amount of guys in Lower Gulch listen to country music, which is filled with such emotional sentiment.  Everyone who is sane is inherently lonely because at the end of the day, there is only one voice inside your head, and that's your own.1      Disregarding the supernatural, sane people are lonely because they can hear only one voice in their head, their own.  To solve this great dilemna, Hollywood seems to love the idea of two souls merging into one.  Psychiatrist, M. Scott Peck, author of  The Road Less Traveled,  says that at the start of relationships, ego-boundaries collapse.  Basically, two personalities merge and two people are able to see the other as a part of themselves.  Inevitably, this boundary eventually re-establishes itself and he says that's where the real work of a relationship begins.  M. Scott Peck says that ego-boundary collapses are a useful falling-in-love trick to coerce two people to start a relationship with eachother.  The idea of two souls merging into one is quite romantic, but often quite disappointing.  I enjoyed Colleen's  urlLink poem, The Beach .  I'm writing about it because it made me think.  I left this comment at Colleen's  urlLink blog :   I prefer to think of it not as two bodies becoming one, but as one body becoming two. Two bodies becoming one implies the temporary collapse of an ego boundary. It's often disappointing when that same collapsed ego boundary re-establishes itself and you realize that you are still alone in your own skin. When one body becomes two, it implies the true creation of a relationship whose existence is no longer intangible.    I think M. Scott Peck was probably right in his mechanics, which is why the ideal of two souls merging is so romantically appealing, especially to a Hollywood able to turn appeal into profit.  Colleen's poem is like a good dream.  At the end of the day, we don't want to be alone in our skulls.  We want there to be someone else there with us.  We like the idea of finding a long-lost part of our soul to talk with.  Some of us are lucky and find something very similar.  For the other less fortunate percentage of the population, any fleeting merger is only mirage.    Two people often are just that: two people.  This concept of one-into-two additionally helps us to think of the other person as worthy of being looked after and cared for, even if there's disagreement.  That's an important part of keeping a relationship alive.  If I were to think that the other person were part of me and I wanted to do something harmful such as being unfaithful, than by the two-into-one logic it wouldn't realy be wrong.  Why?  Because, if they are part of me and I want to do this, then they want me to do it as well.  After all, by the logic of two-into-one, we're the same person so what I want, they want.  When two souls merge, they should agree with eachother perfectly because there is no separation.  They are the same.  I think one-into-two is a much better deal for all concerned than two-into-one.  One-into-two relationships are much more likely to look out for eachother.  So why not two souls out of one?  Romantic replication instead of merging and sticky pulling apart.  We might be happier considering ourselves to temporarily be two people instead of one.  Two instead of one, not one instead of two.  *****  1.  Some might say that you should have God there as well and some might even say three to include the Devil.  Comic,  urlLink Flip Wilson  loved to deliver his line, "The Devil made me do it."  Some people like saying the same thing about God.  Fewer people confess to saying that they made themselves do it.

						   In a previous  urlLink blog entry , I questioned what women look for in men and didn't come to much of a conclusion.  What do men look for?  The following essay synopsizes a February 2000 article in  urlLink Discover  magazine.  Evidently, the definition of beauty for males is abnormal normality.  In studies, the most attractive faces are made of a composite image of hundreds of faces averaged together.  It turns out that the faces most attractive to the human brain deviate from the norm the least.  Babies look longer at "attractive" faces than at "unattractive" faces in studies as well, which implies that part of the hardware that comes with a baby's brain is to create an average of every face it has ever seen.  The closer a face is to the subconscious average, the more attractive it is considered.  Allowances are made for deviations which accent femininity and age.  Deviations which accent that the face is female increase attractiveness.  These adaptations include arched eyebrows, bigger eyes and lips, and a smaller nose, jaw, and chin.  Age also makes a difference.  According to the February 2000 article, the average age of  Playboy  centerfold models from 1953 to 1990 was 21.3 years.    Women are attracted to the average as well, but less to hyper-masculinity.  The  Discover  article mentioned that the face women are attracted to seems to vary with the day of the month, literally.  During ovulation, women find Brad Pitt types more attractive while at other times of month less so.  Characteristically masculine features include bigger jaws, mouth, nose, eyebrows, brow ridges, and sunken eyes.  When women are not ovulating, these features are less attractive, supposedly because women are now looking for a male to help them raise the children and the overly masculine face is seen as a indicator of poor parenting traits.  This may explain why many women seem to be turned off by the extreme of male body-builders.  Men preferred a face up to 20% feminized while the more masculine face preferred by women in the study was only 8% masculinized.  Indeed, male attractiveness in terms of women is more attached to wealth and status and because of that is less dependent on age, though male physical attractiveness, according to the February 2000  Discover  article, peaks in the  urlLink late twenties .  According to one study, women found average-looking and unattractive, but high-paying doctors to be more appealing than very attractive, but medium-paying teachers whereas men in the study never prefered unattractive women.  In a nutshell, men are generally attracted to young, fertile, nubile, and average.  Some might go so far as to say any.  Meanwhile women are attracted to wealthy, powerful, and supportive.  The great writer, Kilgore Trout, was probably right when he summed up men and women by saying, "Men are jerks. Women are psychotic."  How true.

						    HIGH MAINTENANCE   On the "reality" television show,  urlLink Outback Jack , women brag about being high maintenance women.  High maintenance implies that interested men, in order to keep these high maintenance women interested, must be willing to bend over backwards for them, do cartwheels, and give them expensive gifts just to keep them happy.  It's not just "reality" television, though.  There are women who brag about being high maintenance in the real world as well.  I don't understand this.    A fair number of people value German and Japanese cars because of their quality and high reliability.  Women bragging that they are high maintenance is not unlike an animate automobile bragging that it is a  urlLink Yugo , which I doesn't make sense to me.  For God's sake, if I was a Yugo, I certainly wouldn't brag about it.    A woman bragging that she is high maintenance is a woman bragging that she is disposable.  Things that are not well made are generally disposable, because we're not willing to pay the cost of maintenance.  Perhaps this high maintenance boast is really a cry for help.  It's entirely possible that the said women suffer from low self esteem and in that case I guess we should feel sorry for them.  Of course, I feel sorry for Yugo's too, but at the same time I'd much rather date a BMW or a Lexus.  Call me heartless.  I like things that are built to last.

      What images mean to us depends upon the way they are conveyed to us.&nbsp; In John Berger's  Ways of Seeing , one of the essays presented discusses image presentation.&nbsp; The context images are presented in affects our perception of them.&nbsp; Captions and surrounding pictures affect how we interpret an image.  &nbsp;  The face on the left is clearly not my own, but that of Jake Gyllenhaal.&nbsp; Use of Jake Gyllenhall's picture&nbsp;lends a certain amount of anonimity.&nbsp; Jake is also much better looking.&nbsp; At face value, it's obvious that I'm no movie star even though I don't have Jake's advantages of makeup and lighting for my appearance.  &nbsp;  Does our perception of people's appearance change based upon what we know about them?  &nbsp;  Would the profile image be perceived as less disingenuous if I added that the picture was from a movie where Jake Gyllenhaal played a character who changed his name to Holden after the author of "The Catcher in the Rye," the main character of which hated the world's "phoniness."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My use of the character "Holden" and by extension Jake Gyllenhaal's likeness is a statement of implicit conformity with the world's demands that likeable people look like movie stars.&nbsp; At the same time it is also a statement of protest against the same demands by implication of the values which the character "Holden" represents.&nbsp; Holden represents the notion that most of the world is concerned with appearing good and not being good, of appearing good looking, but not being good looking.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Perception is all in the presentation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;
