       1.  Never do anything to prevent another man from getting laid.    This is the foundation for The Code.  Failure to adhere to this Rule results in: a severe beating, public ostracization, and/or temporary or permanent suspension of membership in The Club depending on the gravity of the infraction.  The offended man must serve as judge, jury and executioner and it is not the responsibility of the offended man’s friends to defend his honor.  Please note that women have a similar foundation for their Code and when it is broken the penalties are much more severe!  See Rules #2-6.     2.  Exceptions to Rule #1 are:  he’s after your woman or he wants to fuck another man.   Punishments for infractions of Rule #2 are self-evident.    3.  If another other rule contradicts Rule #1, Rule #1 takes precedence.   After all women are convinced we think only with our dicks and there is no fighting their opinion or genetics, so why pretend otherwise?   4.  Do everything in your power to help another man get laid.   This is also one of the pillars of The Code.  You are required to flirt with her bitchy friend (4 hour limit), loaning of up to $200.00 (one time), letting him use your car or apartment (twice only), and provisioning him with condoms (unlimited).  Again, women have a similar rule, which explains the propensity for matchmaking innate in the female species.   5.  Treat women with respect.   This is the most important rule concerning women and also one of the pillars of the Code.  It is a simple thing, it’s the right thing, and it is essential to your survival in a world dominated by women.  If you are foolish enough to believe women don’t rule the world discontinue reading and turn gay.   6.  Be honest.   Note that I didn’t say don’t ever lie.  As a man, you know that you’re faced with situations that call for a little shading of the truth.  See Rules #7 and #8 for specifics.   7.  Don’t lie for the sake of deception even if it means you don’t get laid.   Be forthright with women.  Rules #5 and #6 demand that you tell them upfront you are not interested in a long-term relationship.  Failure to recognize that women are sexual, sentient beings capable of adult relationships greatly under-estimates the female sex and is indicative that you are still 12 years old and actually do think with your dick.   8.  Don’t cheat.   Men are not cheaters.  You are in no way obligated to lie for another man cheating on his wife or girlfriend when confronted directly and when you have firsthand knowledge that your idiot of a friend is committing such an egregious act.  Men do not cheat at work for profit or promotion.  Men do not cheat at sports or poker.      9.  Keep your word.   There’s an old saying: My word is my bond.  Every man should live by it.  Just think about every time you did not keep your word didn’t you feel like you crap?   10.  Don’t be a bully and stand up for the weak.   There comes a time when toughness, strait-forward brute force, and the defense of principles are necessary.  Men can fight verbally, mentally or physically and never back down for the sake of convenience or fear.   11.  Put family first.   Girlfriends (not wives), jobs and habits come and go, but family is forever.  This includes your mother-in-law.  Call your parents and grandparents often.  A committee comprised of our most esteemed members has not been able to find the right solution as to where to spend Christmas this year.  You’re on your own bud.    12.  Take responsibility for your actions.   Whether you fuck up at work or home, just admit 100% of your screw-up, learn from your mistake and beg forgiveness.    13.  Take a stand for something or you will fall for anything.   A line from a Country song, but oh so true!  Country music is cool – have you seen the women?    14.  Thou shall not rent the movie "Chocolat"  (fill-in-the-blank for any other such similar “chick flick”).  Self-explanatory.  If you do rent “Chocolat”, return your jock strap and take up interior decorating.   15.  Allowing your wife or girlfriend to sleep with, flirt consistently with, have cyber-sex with or otherwise have a sexually based relationship with another man is indicative that you are incapable of satisfying her.    May I suggest Viagra, Cyalis, Enzyte or a penile implant?     16.  Own, understand and use tools.   It is inconsequential if you know how to work on cars, with electricity or plumbing, or with medal or wood.  You must, however, be capable of safely operating machinery designed to cut-off, injure, burn or otherwise mutilate body parts.  Women dig it and men respect it.       17.  Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.   It’s a little fucking rain – get over it.    18.  Read the books your father read and listen to the music your kids listen to.   These actions keep you in touch with both in the past and the future.  If your kids, however, listen to gangster rap you are authorized to beat them senseless until they understand the beauty of 70’s Rock.    19.  Any man who brings a camera or hidden microphone to a bachelor party may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.    There are some things that must remain a mystery to women.    20.  Learn to dance.    Dancing is one of the things women love the most (hence helps you get laid) and must be considered as “sex training” (after all it’s all in the hips).      21.  What another man is doing is nobody’s business.   When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, boss, priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts.  You are permitted to deny his very existence providing he is not cheating and you are confronted directly.    22.  Work out.   It is your obligation to take care of your body – after all it is the support system for your dick.  Women like men with firm butts (don’t ask why!), broad shoulders, strong biceps and flat bellies.  Keeping in shape does not stop when you get married.        23.  Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.   Men are obligated to repay bail loans within 90 days.   24.  You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without recrimination.   Beyond that, anyone within earshot is allowed to call “bullshit”.  Exception: When trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent.  Men are obligated after establishing a relationship with a woman to tell the truth about any exaggeration told in a bar (or any other place) before a proposal for marriage.    25.  There is no such thing as “women’s work” with the exception of suckling a baby.  Men change diapers, clean the floors, use the washer-dryer without assistance or screwing up the whites, can iron silks and do not balk at cleaning the toilets.     26.  If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits forever unless granted specific permission from the man and consent from the father.   Think about it, would you want any of your friends screwing your sister?   27.  Be on time.   The maximum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who is running late is 5 minutes.  For a woman, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.  Moreover, your boss expects it and since he gives you the money you require to get laid………..    28.  Actually have sex in the kitchen, on the dining room table, while in the shower or any other such place your mate thinks is exciting.   All I can say is “Duh” if you don’t.   29.  Remember anniversaries and birthdays.   Again, all I can say is “Duh” if you don’t.   30.  No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man.   In fact, even remembering a male friend’s birthday is strictly optional.   31.  Enjoy what you do for a living.   A great deal of your life revolves around your work.  Enjoy it or find another profession.    32.  Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy’s refrigerator is forbidden.   You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable for consumption.   33.  Be able to tell a good joke.   Every man should have at least five funny unused jokes (preferably dirty) at any given time.  Understand that most women like dirty jokes too and no man should be fearful of using the word pussy in front of women.  Just to make sure – ask first.     34.  Agreeing to distract the less than stunning friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying to hook up with is your legal duty.   Should you get carried away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to speak of it, even at your bachelor party.    35.  Be talented at giving oral sex to women.   First of all, most women have their strongest orgasms when receiving oral sex and hence will actually want to have sex with you more often.  Secondly, it is unreasonable for you to expect her to suck your dick if you’re not willing to eat her pussy.  Please note that both parties must observe personal hygiene – keep the smegma to a minimum, wipe your ass and be open about the need to douche.       36.  Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission and he, in return, is required to grant it.    Listen knucklehead, you gave up on this fine young thing so don’t go off the deep end.  The ex-boyfriend is required to inform the suitor of the reasons he willingly chose to leave or why she dumped him.  It is the obligation of the suitor to find out more than “she’s a psycho bitch who couldn’t fuck to save her life!"   37.  Men watch sports.   Football, and I don’t mean soccer, is the preferred sport of men.  NASCAR racing, boxing, baseball, hockey, and basketball are all acceptable forms of sports television.  Bass fishing, golf, lumberjack competitions, and rodeo events are only acceptable in moderation as they are suitable sports for actually doing but not watching on a consistent basis.  Mens wrestling, gymnastics, swimming, and figure skating are not acceptable except during the Olympics and a USA team is involved.      38.  When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.   If you don’t know who the hell is playing and what significance the game has you need to watch SportsCenter more often.  Impersonating Chris Berman is gay.   39.  Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a buffalo wing clean.   Self-explanatory.  Women who can eat more buffalo wings and consume more Jack Daniels than you during a sporting event must be seriously considered as marriage candidates.   40.  The only acceptable position for the toilet seat is down.   Hundreds of millions of man-hours have been wasted arguing this topic.  Just put it up when you pee and put it down when you are done.  End of discussion – let’s all high five, claim victory and get a beer.    41.  If a man’s zipper is down, that's his problem.   You didn't see nothing.    42.  Be known for your character.   Whole volumes could be written on this topic.  This is your business card, the determining factor for women when they are deciding if they want to allow you to sleep with them, and foundation of your reputation as a human being.  See Rule #43.   43.  Live according to a defined set of values.   The U.S. Army has a damn fine list:  Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.  This is known as the LDRSHP Principle.  Defend your values, whatever they may be, to your dying breath.  The defense and adherence to your values determines your character.         44.  Learn to cook.   First of all, man cannot live on fast food alone (I’ve tried).  Secondly, unless you are Bill Gates, it is too damn expensive.  Thirdly, it is unreasonable to expect your woman to cook every meal for you.  Finally, women love men who can layout a fine spread and hence will have sex with you more often.  Cooking involves helping with the dishes regardless of who is the chef.  Please note most of the great chefs in the world are men.  Why many are French is still under study.           45.  The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer and pizza.    Men are obligated to help a buddy move particularly if recently divorced (don’t worry he wont have much left).  If you own a pick-up truck you must volunteer your services before being asked.   46.  Men like dogs – big ones that can hunt and slobber on things.   A single man must never own a cat or initially like his girlfriend's cat.  If, however, you marry a woman who loves cats you must learn to accept the beast as part of the family and give it a proper funeral even if you were “accidentally” involved in its demise.    47.  Plan for your retirement.   No woman wants to be old and broke.  You worked your ass off for 40 years and if you can’t live comfortably in your golden years you are a fucking loser!  Men start putting money away no later than age 25 and don’t count on an inheritance.    48.  Buy cheap cars and expensive houses before the age of 50  (unless you make a shit-load of money and can afford both).  A car loses value the instant you drive off the lot, but your home is your castle and always grows in value.  After the age of 50 it is wise to scale down the house and buy that luxury sedan you’ve always wanted.  Jaguars, BMW’s and Mercedes are cool cars for older men.  Balding old men in convertibles are pathetic.   49.  Have plenty of insurance and know how loans work.   Life, home, medical/dental, personal property and auto insurance is a must.  If the phrase 5 year ARM has you confused you are doomed to financial ruin.     50.  Your girlfriend/wife must bond with your buddy's girlfriends/wives within 30 minutes of meeting them.   You are not required to make nice with her male “friends”.  Low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.  Understand that even her gay male friends want to sleep with your woman deep inside.    51.  Men are not matchmakers.   When your girlfriend/wife expresses a desire to fix her whiny, overweight, bitter friend up with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood, being in a committed relationship or gay.      52.  You are what you drink.   Men drink, in precedence, beer, whiskey, scotch, bourbon, gin and vodka.  It is permissible to consume a fruity drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach... and a topless supermodel delivers it... and it's free.  Men do not drink white wine spritzers - ever.  Tequila and schnapps should be reserved for special occasions and every Friday night is not a special occasion.  Men do not drive home drunk – that’s why there are cabs.    53.  Men know how to use a gun.   You are a macho asshole if you take pleasure in killing things, but if you don’t know how to shoot you are a mama’s boy.  Stuffing things you kill is just sick.  Women give men bonus points for knowing how to shoot a cannon, use a tank, or fire a naval gun.  Think about it – big guns that go boom-boom-boom.   54.  Size matters.   If, unfortunately, The Lord has not endowed you with His Blessings then learn how to give a woman really good head.     55.  Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.   Need I say more?    56.  Read the Bible.   The Code and the general life of men necessitates breaking some of the 10 Commandments.  If you do not understand absolution, you will be damned to Hell (defined as getting butt fucked for Eternity by 15-inch dicks made of near-molten steel).    57.  A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight for her, get an erection and have sex when they come home.   Self-explanatory.  Otherwise said hot babe is fair game.    58.  Do not abuse homosexuals.   Remember just because they are fools there are more women for us!  If your mate has a female friend who is a lesbian do not encourage a ménage a trios – you may end up getting more than you bargained for.  Women kiss better than men and it is impossible to compete with a vibrator.       59.  If a buddy is outnumbered, out manned, or too drunk to fight, you must jump into the fight.    Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have caused you to think, "What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin", then you may sit back and enjoy.    60.  Get over being bald.   You’re bald because you have too much testosterone in your system (TV commercials confirm this scientific fact), so get over it.  There are a significant number of women who think bald men are sexy.  Attempting to hold on to your youth in desperation by combing your side hair over is pathetic.  So is wasting money on transplants and miracle cures.      61.  Locker Room/Gym etiquette must be observed.   Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while weight lifting: "Yeah, baby, push it!", "C'mon, give me one more!  Harder!, "Another set and we can hit the showers.", and "Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?”.  A minimum of one showerhead separation is required and never check out another man’s goods.        62.  Men are simple.   The world is black or white, good or evil, and right or wrong.  This is not to say that men are incapable of complex thought and see interconnected relationships.  We do it all the time, but don’t let minutia get in the way of making a clear decision.  After all, Einstein was a man.  Side note:  it has been confirmed that Einstein’s tongue and not his brain was the reason Marilyn Monroe found him so sexy.         63.  Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but not both.  That's just plain greedy.    64.  Listen – really listen.   This is the biggest mistake men make when talking to women.  I know you don’t give a shit about how well the shoes complement her favorite dress, but if you blow her off you will be discussing accessories for hours.  This is closely related to Rule # 5.   65.  If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his beer.   Same thinking goes for compliments on his “buns”.  Self-explanatory.     66.  Your parents get proportionally smarter as you get older.   Men are required to send their parents to an all-expense paid vacation to Hawaii for all the shit they caused their parents while a teenager.   67.  Never join your girlfriend/wife in dissing a buddy.   This is very dangerous territory for most men.  Sometimes you got to subjugate your need to get your Willy wet to honor the Code.   68.  Let her use the remote control.   Most men have an unhealthy fixation with the remote similar to that of a 13-year-old boy who recently discovered masturbation and how to unscramble the dirty movie channel.   69.  There are lots of good TV shows besides sports.   The History Channel, the Nature Channel, PBS, The Discovery Channel, and the Comedy Channel are places to find common ground when she is operating the remote.  A word on television – don’t watch too much.  Your social life with your mate should not consist of vegging on the couch night after night endlessly flipping through channels in the vain hope of finding something you both can agree upon.  If it is then expect to hear about it - often.  Men do not watch soaps, Oprah or Dr. Phil.       70.  Bringing reading material to the bathroom is just plain wrong.   Get in, do your business, and get out.  And for God’s Sake turn on the fan.      71.  Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing :  either you are both urinating (look strait forward) or both waiting in line (look away from other men urinating).  In all other situations, a nod is all the conversation you need.  Urinal spacing is also important – never purposely stand next another man when there are plenty of others to use.     72.  If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not join him.   Exception occurs when you are in the back seat of a squad car after being picked up for public urination and the cops have Led Zeppelin cranked.  You’re fucked so you might as well enjoy the ride.     73.  Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt one intervention.   If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye and deliver a "Fuck Off!" you are absolved of your responsibility.   74.  Women like men in uniform.   Military, policemen, firemen, and doctors all enjoy the bonuses of wearing a uniform.  If these professions are not for you, then get a uniform for special occasions and why you’re at it get her a nurse uniform (trust me on this one).   75.  Be inventive in bed.   Hey the two-minute missionary drill on a twice-monthly basis is unacceptable.  Get creative and openly discuss techniques/options with your mate.  Let her get on top (much more pleasurable for women than the missionary position), dominate from behind (doggy style), and be willing to incorporate vocalizations, light bondage, blindfolds, foods and “devices”.  Sexual decisions must be made mutually.     76.  Date your mate.   Take her out regularly like you did when you were in hot pursuit.  Treat her like you did when you first met all the time.  Open doors, pull out her chair and use table manners.  You must take your wife out at least monthly to a place she actually wants to go.  Also related to Rule #5.     77.  Learn to give a good massage.   Is there anything better than rubbing oils over your mate’s naked body?  Besides giving a good massage leads to increased frequency of sex and is indicative of your ability to use your hand tools.     78.  Don’t put your woman on a pedestal.   It’s uncomfortable and after 40 her butt will likely be too big to fit on it anyway.  Seriously, this is not fair to her and you will always end up disappointed, abused and manipulated.   79.  Be a cultured human being.   Learn about the world’s cultures and customs.  Bonus points for learning a foreign language (do you know that the US is the only civilized country where multiple languages aren’t regularly taught to the young?).  Most couples get stale because the man’s idea of culture is going to Red Lobster.           80.  Fear of commitment is mans greatest weakness.   Yeah I know there are plenty fish in the sea, blah, blah, blah………  Listen knucklehead, if you want to fuck her then you must be willing to commit to her.  The consequences of being the Lone Wolf on the prowl are masturbation and loneliness.     81.  Men Ride Harley’s not Japanese Crotch Rockets.   If you don’t get this, start over at Rule # 1 and read slowly.    82.  There are definitive periods for wallowing in self-pity after getting dumped.   Anything less than 3 months = one hour.  3 to 6 months = one day.  6 months to 2 years = one week.  Over two years = one month.  After that it is the duty of all a man’s friends to kick him in the ass, get him drunk and take him to the nudie bar.  Men who go to women for advise on how to recover from being dumped are still suckling on the teat and should be shot.    83.  Long distance relationships never work.   Listen here Long Dong Silver your dick ain’t that big nor is your will that strong.  One or the other of you will stray from the relationship.  Better to cut it off early than to prolong its certain death.  You can begin a relationship over long distances (internet romances), but you must be prepared to travel often.  If she is the right girl a time will come when you can be together full-time.     84.  Never break up with a woman and have her hate you.   Just because things didn’t work out doesn’t mean you need to be an asshole.  Not only is this related to Rule #5 but you must understand that every other woman who sees you two break up is watching you very closely and the women’s chat network is very strong.  Since your future sex life depends on finding another woman be a gentleman.      85.  Know and follow Clint Eastwood’s 10 Rules.   1.  Call your own shots.  2.  Be fearless.  3.  Keep moving.  4.  Love your job.  5.  Speak softly.  6.  Don't be predictable.  7.  Find a good woman.  8.  Learn to play the piano (not so sure about that one, but hey it’s Clint).  9.  You are what you drive.  10.  Avoid extreme makeovers.   86.  If you get lost ask for directions.   Again the man-hours wasted arguing over men’s innate sense of direction are in the hundreds of millions.  That said, remember Christopher Columbus was lost and managed to find something pretty damn cool.    87.  Never look in the rear view mirror.   I’m not talking about when driving you idiot, but about life.  What was, was.  You can’t change it and you can’t go back.   88.  Be faithful.   This is very difficult because it is contrary to nature.  Understand 95% of the species in the world do not have monogamous relationships and that 60% of married women have an affair at some time in their lives.      89.  Stuff doesn’t make you happy, only you can.   I know plenty of very unhappy rich bastards.  Happiness is found within and is shared with those you love.  Yep, I know, but we all got both X and Y-chromosomes.  Got problems with that take it up the Big Man upstairs.    90.  Solve your own problems.   If you are expecting the world to treat you fairly, make right again what once went wrong, and hand you the winning lottery ticket you are a fool.     91.  Don’t be a complainer.   Women bitch, discuss, and then solve problems.  Men solve problems then discuss how they should have solved the problem.   92.  If owed an apology stand your ground.   Forgiveness is mandatory but the offending person, regardless of sex, is required to meaningfully ask for it.  If offended in a public forum a public apology is required.   93.  Be persistent.   Your success in life depends solely on how much you work at it.  Give up easily, fail to give 100%, and not staying the course results in mediocrity.  No true man settles for being average.  If you get bucked off the bronco, dust yourself off and get back on for the ride of your life.  Gold belt buckles come in endless forms.   94.  Don’t do drugs or be a drunk.   Firstly, it’s stupid.  Secondly, it’s expensive.  Thirdly, it kills you.  Fourthly, and most importantly, it decreases your sexual performance.    95.  Listen to your inner voice.   Every time you are about to screw-up, make the wrong decision, take the easy way out, or put the keys in the ignition after too many drinks a little voice goes off in your head.  This is God’s way of telling you to stop and think.  It takes years of training to listen to your inner voice.  Sometimes the message isn’t clear or loud so you must train to listen.          96.  Travel.   Traveling does not consist of going to your parents house every Christmas.  See the Grand Canyon, go to Paris and Rome, and bask in the Caribbean sun.       97.  Invest in your kids and relationship.   Failure to sit down with your daughter and help her with her math homework, teach your son to throw a baseball, and do things she likes to do results in regret later in life.  When your kids are born start a college fund.        98.  Take risk.   I’ve learned more from the mistakes I’ve made because I was willing to stick my neck out than I ever did by playing it safe.  When you take risk the rewards are always great.  Taking risk doesn’t mean being bold – boldness alone gets you killed.  I’ve been to three combat zones and have seen good men die because they were bold, and trust me their deaths weren’t necessary, heroic or pretty.     99.  Be able to drive a stick shift.    To be a man you don’t have to own a 5-speed Ferrari, but being able to get behind the wheel of any car with a manual transmission is.     100.  Don’t quibble over the check.   Tallying-up who had desert and the extra cup of coffee is pointless.  Here’s how it works whether you are with another couple or a bunch of friends: split it evenly.  The only acceptable reason to ask for separate checks is when you are on business and must present meals claims.  No splitting the check on a date!   101.  Be Generous.   This has to do with Rule #100 (tip at least 15% no matter where you eat) and so much more.  You work hard for one reason:  to share your wealth.  Generosity is more than spreading a few dollars around.  Allow people to make mistakes, open your mind to new ideas, and give of yourself.    102.  Always use “Miss” and never use “Ma’am”.   My mother taught me this one and boy am I glad she did.  The 10000’s of smiles and brightened eyes I have received from observing this simple rule have made my life better.  No woman wants to be called ma’am because it makes her feel old.  I know ma’am is big in the South and with the military, but cultural lines are disappearing and ma’am is increasingly unacceptable.      103.  Buy flowers for no reason often.   It is easy to buy her flowers on her birthday or your anniversary, but if you want her to know how much you really love her bring home a couple dozen long-stemmed red roses on a Tuesday night.   104.  She is always the most important person in the room.   Whether she spent hours getting ready for the gala ball or is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt at the barbeque she is the most beautiful creature on the planet – after all she came in with you!  During the course of the evening you two are going to drift away (don’t be like Saran wrap), but catch her eye from time to time, give her a wink and a smile to let her know you are thinking of her – and you are watching her flirting with the cute younger man!   105.  Diamonds.   Enough said?   106.  Learn from John Wayne.   Despite having the real first name of Marion, the Duke became the icon for all that is male.  He epitomized the cowboy, the soldier, the cop and every man because he showed what a single man can do if he is determined regardless of the forces against him.  The Duke was not some macho braggart – he backed up his words with action and, more importantly, with compassion.       107.	Back hair.   Again, enough said?    108.  Be a sharp dressed man.   ZZ Top got it right otherwise a bunch of scruffy guitar pickers from Texas wouldn’t have such a bevy of beautiful women who love their music and want to be in their videos.  Get a good suit, shine your shoes, and be neatly groomed.  Have you ever noticed those old men who seem to have their own unique style (even if it looks ridiculous to you) have the old women beam in their presence?  Find your style!  Men dress themselves and buy their own clothes.   109.  Tattoos and earrings should be limited to a select few.   If you are a biker they are an absolute must, but if you work in an office shuffling papers the earring doesn’t make you look like Fabio.  Come to think of it – does any man really want to look like Fabio?     110.  Let her have whatever side of the bed she wants.   This is another one men have wasted a lot of time on.  The only side of the bed I care about is the middle when I’m naked, having sex with my mate, and I’m on the bottom because I need the rest!   111.  Lead - don’t follow.   This is a very old truism.  If there is a problem to be solved, a decision to be made, a challenge to be overcome be in front.  Being a sheep or lemming in the background criticizing the action is like being a eunuch in a harem – you don’t have the tools to do anything so just shut-up.  Now it is impossible to lead everything – if you try you are a micro-managing asshole – so it is imperative you know how to lead and be part of the team.  In my business, being a solider, being a leader comes naturally to many and is instilled in all of our training, but being a team player is just as important.   112.  Be a gentlemen.   Whether you are with your mate at home or out in public observe simple rules of etiquette:  give her your arm when walking down the street, hold her hand in public, hold the door open for strangers, and walk with her not in front of her.  Say please and thank you.  Recognize the cab driver as a human being.  Say hello to the tollbooth operator.  You get the idea – be a human.   113.  Have a firm handshake and look people in the eye.   This is old business adage, but it applies to life as well.  A lack of either indicates you have a weak mind and low self esteem.   114.  Observe Colin Powell’s Rules.   1.  It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.  2.  Get mad, then get over it.  3.  Avoid having your ego so close to your position that, when your position falls, your ego goes with it.  4.  It can be done!  5.  Be careful what you choose, you may get it. 6.  Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision. 7.  You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours. 8.  Check small things.  9.  Share credit.  10.  Remain calm. Be kind.  11.  Have a vision. Be demanding.  12.  Don't take counsel of your fears or nay Sayers.  13.  Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.   115.  Don’t be afraid to piss people off.   Try to placate everyone and no one will be happy.  More importantly, you will stifle the best and brightest around you.  Take “outrageous” stands, expect people to do the impossible, and demand high standards of performance – you will be surprised at the success you will achieve.  This Code pissed off some of my dearest female friends – why I’m not sure as it is intended to be humorous and insightful, but I sleep very well at night living this Code everyday.  At least I know who I am, have nothing to hide from, and have no reason to be ashamed for “being in touch with myself” – even the darker sides.               116.  Find your own Code to live by.   Hey these are just the thoughts of one man.  Find your own rules and live by them.  If you come across one that would be beneficial to other men please share them.  We are in this together and it is our duty to do anything to help another man get laid – what you forgot Rules #1 and #4 already?    117.  Take the hard right over the easy wrong.   This is the final pillar of the Code.  I put it near the bottom not because it isn’t important, but because I want you to remember it.  Everything you do and say tells others who you really are.  People are not stupid.  When you take the easy way out, fail to stand up for your values, show less than honorable character, take advantage of the weak, fail to be honest or cheat we all see it.  We may still be your friends but we will always think less of you.    118.  Share the Code with Women.   I know many of you are saying this is sacrosanct stuff and moreover you have surely offended some.  How can we give out our best secrets to women or risk the wrath of half the planet’s occupants?  Listen, men have nothing to hide.  We are who and what we are.  Go back over the Code as see if there is anything in it that every woman doesn’t already know about us.  Sure, women are a mystery.  Men will never understand the Women’s Code.  They should remain a wondrous mystery otherwise life would be boring as hell!      The Major
