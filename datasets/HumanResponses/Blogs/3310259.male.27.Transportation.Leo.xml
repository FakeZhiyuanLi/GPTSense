      Quick Tips on Methamphetamine Methamphetamine is also called “meth,” “crystal,” “ice,” “speed,” “jib” and “crank.” Methamphetamine is a drug that stimulates the central nervous system. When people use methamphetamine, they feel alert and energetic and often have no interest in food or sleep. Users may experience any or all of the following negative effects:  -rapid and unhealthy weight loss (under no circumstances should this drug be considered as an aid to weight loss)  -sores on the skin, or itchy skin that can lead to scratching and sores and infection  confusion, irrational anger, paranoia and irritability  -damage to the inside of the nose from “railing” (snorting) the drug  -out of control rages (violent and aggressive behaviour referred to as “tweaking”)  -problems with thinking, memory, concentration and movement  -brain damage — there is evidence that brain damage occurs in some users  There are ads on phonebooths in NYC that says that one effect of using Crystal Meth is having unprotected sex and the result is transmitting the HIV Virus or AIDS.   A LOT of Gay men in NYC are FIERCELY addicted to Crystal Meth and the above facts need to be known.

      Noone is in charge of AA.    If you have the desire to stop drinking than you have the requirement to have a seat as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous!  NOONE IS TO KEEP YOUR FROM YOUR MEETINGS!  That includes yourself or any chairperson!  The only leader of Alcoholics Anonymous is your own Higher Power!  MAKE YOUR MEETINGS!!!  YES!  Days will come when people will make you mad.  PRINCIPLES OVER PERSONALITIES!  People will let you down but THE PROGRAM WON't!  One day at a time!  THIS too shall pass!!!

      Life has always something to challenge me accepting when I am powerless. Yesterday I went to the DMV to get my ID replaced than go to the SS office and get my SS Card replaced too. The DMV now require you providing your SS Card to put in thier system. I am powerless because I didn't have my SS Card and I need my ID to get my SS Card.   I didn't overreact but feel so not able to do anything but do the next right thing. I have to now call the SS Card office to see if I can get them to send me a new SS Card. Well.  I have to keep my Grateful List and keep up a the best attitude about things no matter how challenging they can be.

      "What the heck - give this guy a thrill and visit his site. He is homeless in NYC."  "Give him a thrill"?  Ok.  Don't know how to take that.

      I had to make the 5:30p meeting at The Rainbow Room.   There was a 90 day celebrant who Qualified(shared his story).  There was Double Peanut butter cookies!!! The meeting was relaxing.   One thing I know, if I speak about my fear(false evidence appearing real), than something my just change it.  I left the meeting and went str8 to work and prayed on the way.  I left it in God's hands because I had to realize I had NO control over that night.  All I knew I had to do was get to work on time and stay until 1am.   It was a great night of work!  I stayed awake and the job gets easier and enjoyable.  It was a nice evening!! I slept at Penn Station at the Long Island Waiting area.  The cops didn't bother me once I showed them my train ticket. I am chairing the 8am and 10:30am meeting today.  Not sure about the 12p yet but will have to stay for that.

      We progress.  We will NEVER achieve perfection in any way. When my "Ranter" sees that I am moving up in my life he is moved to post anything.  That is amusing to me.   I made some meetings today.  I haven't called Allen this morning and I should have.  I have to call him before work tonight. I am about to hit The Rainbow Room. I am tired and had little sleep.  I hope I won't be too sleepy tonight. I am pushing myself to work.

      This will be my first full week of work.  I am excited. I still have to get my ID and SS Card resent.  I just haven't had the measly $8 to do it. Well.  I had did the 4th and 5th steps today with my sponsor Greg.  It was a breakthru. Today is a bit warm and humid and hopefully tonight won't be so much.

      I have 2 sponsors.   I had asked Allen to be my sponsor but his time was not available to sit down and work the Steps(of recovery) with me.   I than asked Greg to be my sponsor but I kept Allen because I did not feel I needed to let him go. Greg is working the steps with me. I am about to hit the 4th Step with Greg and start Step 1 with Allen. Allen and I met today at a Big Book meeting on W. 16th near 7th Ave.  It is a 6p Sunday meeting. After the meeting we discussed things and he gave me things to do.  I am to call him every day morning and night.   It is a hot and humid day.  I did not go to my Sunday Service because someone made thier 90 days so I went to a meeting.  I chaired that meeting because the chairperson did not show up.  It is good to chair.  Good service! I had a good day!

      What is it? It is a recovery program for alcoholics. The ONLY requirement to be a member is to have a DESIRE to stop drinking. It is a program of suggestions.  People are NOT to TELL you what you need to do. It has the original "12 Suggested Steps of Recovery".   It is a SPIRITUAL program.  You lean on YOUR OWN Higher Power.  It is like Detox or Rehab.  It is TRUE RECOVERY! The fellowship is amazing and needed. I have a lot to say about it but this is good so far.

      I got lazy about posting again.  It happens. This week was good.  I didn't work many days due to it being a training time.  Next week I am to work a full 30 hours.  I need to get some good clothes. I feel good about my 90 days of sobriety.   I have 2 chairing commitments and maybe looking for more. I have 2 sponsors and both are great. One sponsor is sitting down with me and working on the the steps(of recovery) and the other is one I am calling to check in everyday. It is HOT DAYS!  It is humid and my skin is nasty! EW!  I have make sure I am showering more. I hope that when I start getting paid I can keep myself in more better condition than I am now. But things are better and in progress. Tonight I am chairing a meeting at 9p.

      I have to say that Mr. Cheng does not have a reason or gives in to negative comments him.  He does not swear or post rude remarks AGAINST ANYONE! I did post an accusation of him being homeless and I should NOT have. But I do know that Mr. Cheng DOES NOT act out in anger but with calmness and serenity. Do not think that any of the past comments(that appear rude, slanderous or outrageously nasty) are from him.  Everyone here knows of my "ranter" and HE STILL has done nothing to deter what I am doing and about.  He is nothing to me and I will allow his postings only because he CAN DO NOTHING against me to affect me in a bad way.  LET HIM RANT!  He is a weak individual who is lonely, sick and tired.

      On day 91 of my sobriety was turn in a new direction.  No longer counting days meant something.  It meant more work and living a life with meaning and purpose.  I think I will stay with THIS blog until I leave homelessness.    I feel more at home with Blogger.com than anywhere else.  Today I start a FULL week of work.  I am happy for a job.
