      Started off a new leaf. At the W India office. Seems very professional. The entire atmosphere. Meetings and presentations!! TOO MUCH! Me impressed.   Evening got introduced to everyone in the office. And at last I get to know her name. The sweetest person in the entire office, without a doubt.

      I don’t believe in writing my own blog. Never believed in it. But you know what. There is a reason for it. The reason being I think I am MAD. :D. Ha ha… I never knew when Irfan told me about the association with W India, I would be this MAD! And why?! Well, I walked into W India office to conduct an interview, for marketing guys for CITY.com… and guess who I see. This girl… gee!! Did she have a smile to kill for and face to die for. Looks like I am gonna love working here. :)  And apart from that being the main reason to start writing the blog, my second reason is, poor Tariq doesn’t have any friends now to talk to. Goldie listens to me, but when he’s sleepy he just puts his head on my laps and snores away. Lucky dog! Wish I was like him, eat & sleep. No worries at all.  Indu sends me a mail today, saying she would be in Manali for a longer time. Guess this is completely it. Was I wrong in being a lil more practical and getting priorities right for both of us. Or maybe I right. Dunno. Anyways, I suppose this is how it had to end.

      See, didn’t I tell u I was bad at maintaining this blog. I haven’t written for close to a month. Guess its cause of a) me being lazy b) lots of work c) lost in love :D. Ha ha…    I sent her a message today, asked her out for dinner. Was very scared to press the send button. She didn’t reply until around 7.15pm I get a call… “Hello, Tariq, this is S here”… I could have jumped up and down in the car itself. And that is exactly what I did. Soon after she told me we could make it for dinner some other time, I went MADDDDD! I was jumping and jumping and jumping in the car and people around me were obviously thinking what’s wrong with this guy. Guess what, I stopped and gave a kid some money… now why did I do that? Tariq Salaam… U R A GONE CASE!

      Irfan quit. And I slowly get to know the dirty tricks he was up to all this while. He was not a person to believe or trust. I think I need to speak to Harish and tell him everything else. Need to be clear if I have to work here.

      Design of the paper looks like will never get done. Arrgh!! Why don’t I just leave this place. But, what about her? Would I loose contact with her? I can’t do that. Not now! I wait to get into office to see her, I try and get back into office in the evening just to see her. And how do I leave this place now. But what’s happening at the other side as well. I rest my case with you, GOD! HELP me out!

      Being more than a month and still the paper’s not out. Irfan has been telling me a lot of stuffs about the company. Did I join the wrong place? What’s going to happen to the paper I have started, ran around, and sacrificed my life for this paper. Is it all going down the drain now?

      YIPEEEE!!! She called me in the morning. Got to speak to her first thing in the morning. The damn line was not clear. She said she’d call me later. Haven’t called till now. Hope she would soon. I am tired looking at my mobile every now and then for it to ring and hear that sweet voice.   What do I do, should I tell her that she means everything to me? Should I tell her that I really really LIKE her?

      THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!! Yes without a doubt, today was THE day. It could never have been better. I spent the whole day with her. YIPPEEEEEEEEE! And how I stopped myself from telling her that I really really really like her, GOD alone knows!  Why can’t I tell her? But what if she doesn’t like it. What if she never looks at me after this, what if she never ever talks to me after this. Is it worth taking that risk? NO WAY! I rather just be happy that she talks to me and that she calls me sometimes. But for how long Tariq?!   She left y’day to meet her friend. I just watched her go. I didn’t want to leave her. Wanted to be with her as long as I could. Standing there, I could have told her. Hmm… you have no hope Tariq. Give up!!!

      Its her B’DAY. Can I go and sing in front of her house? Can I go wish her? Can I just be with her? Office was horrible today! She wasn’t there. I tried to stay out of office the whole day. Was hoping she’d call me sometime. And she did… evening. Wanted to meet her. But she had plans. Of course you fool! Who wants to spend their b’day with a looser like you. You go back and play with Goldie. At least he will like me spending time with him.

      We went for coffee again! Or rather to have chat this time around. Spoke quite a bit! The more I speak and be with her, the more I want that conversation to go on. Tariq my dear, you are cultivating a BAD habit! But tell me what do I do? Forget her??? Take it from me – IMPOSSIBLE!

      LAUNCH!!! CITY.com did launch after all the hurdles and after all the hiccups. I never expected to see this day. But at the end of it was I thrilled or what!!! Waiting out for the rest of the guys to turn up, there I saw her coming. I would have gone down on my knees there and told her right there. She was beyond what words could explain. GOD!!!!!! Why can’t I just tell her?   All I could think of was to be where she was present. Got to tell her at some point that she looked awesome. But is that all I had to say? You are such a coward Tariq!  Sitting on the dais, looking at her make those announcements, I forgot everything that I had to speak. Hehe… managed to say something at the end of all that.  I just could keep my eyes of her the whole night. Tariq look away look away!!! But hey, what do you do when your are completely lost and gone because of this girl.  Stayed till 1 that night, with the guys. But was that what you wanted. Didn’t you want to escort some one back home? So much for chivalry? HUH!!

      Trust me on the fact... "a lot can happen over coffee" :) or at least this would be the right excuse to get a conversation going on. And MAN!!! Did it work!   I suppose this was our first interaction. The first one-on-one. Must have been one of me 'happier days’. Sounds pretty ironical isn’t it... close to 3 years with someone and here I am... this one person sitting in front of me... sipping good 'ol filter coffee, has driven me nuts beyond imagination.  And the best thing out of it is, I seem to be so much at ease with her. Like we’ve known each other for a very very long time. Where would this end, I really do not know? But I am very sure about one thing. I would do anything to be with her as long as I can.
