      Not in such a good mood. Am starting to realize that a lot of my friends will call me when they have problems yet when I need to talk to them I seem to be SOL. Maybe I just need to get new friends.....ha ha ha just kidding.   I decided that I really do want to move. To somewhere warm. I need a change from this crappy weather and think I am at the point in my life where I really can do it. Cali is first on my list and Florida after that. I also do really want to move to New York but really, climate still similar to here. Although if I find some sort of job in NYC at a great place, then I would take it. But for right now I am searching CA jobs and am really thinking about doing AmeriCorp. I think it will be a great experience. Plus they have a lot of organizations in California which is good.   Related to my last reality filled post, Bob the Bachelor was on Eric and Kathys Morning Train Wreck (which yes, involved the band Train). He sang two songs. Not going to lie, he actually has a good voice, however, like I said before the songs suck. And no one really cared that he was there because the main reason people were there was for Train.   Anyways, nothing exciting planned for the weekend. Maybe going out to dinner with Stef and Amy and maybe going to Kincaids but not sure if I am in the mood for that. Thought maybe about going to Roscoes with Sean but my fabulous mo friend is in the I am not calling anyone mode. Sometimes actually wish I talked to K more because I bet I could hang out with him. But it would be weird to call him before 11pm. Plus, the last time I talked to him was like two weeks ago at 2am when he sent me a text. Also talk to AS but really, nothing is going to happen with that. I do have to admit that he is fun to hang out with though. He told me to call him tonight, so if I do end up going out, I will probably call him. Tomorrow night I am going out with my sister and maybe meeting up with our friend Angelo. Sunday is the SuperBowl, which I have zero interest in watching, other than for the commercials. But have a huge long chapter to read for my editing class so will probably be doing that for the majority of the weekend. And I really need to kick my ass into high gear for that class cuz it's A LOT harder than I thought. Ugh.   More later.  Song of the week: Evolve-Ani DiFranco & Curb Side Profit-Jason Mraz Book: Chicago Manual of Style (which is all I will be reading for the next month) :( TV Show: Sex and the City (4 episodes left) Wish of the week: a pair of Ugg Boots....my feet are cold!!!

      Bob the Bachelor has a cd out. Actually I think that he might have a few more out but only hit it big cuz, well, he's the bachelor. And really, bring me my girlfriend and a bottle of wine....those are some mighty fine lyrics Mr. Guinney. But he and Estella broke up (of course) and according to US Weekly she is selling her promise ring on e-bay and taking her family on a trip. You go girl! Personally, the only reality couple I am actually sad about breaking up is Andrew and Jen. However, things might not necessarly be over between them.  OK, this is really sad that my post is all about reality television. But when that's pretty much the only thing on tv, well it's hard not to watch. My two new guilty pleasures this year are Average Joe Hawaii and America's Next Top Model 2. And American Idol starts tonight. Although I think that I am only going to watch the first couple cuz the tryouts are the best. And then the last few. And of course the last Real World/Road Rules Challenge of the Gauntlet is on tonight...and new newlyweds on wednesday. Wow. I really need to get a life. Or at least stop watching other peoples! hahah I will not allow myself to watch My big fat obnxious Fiance though. I mean really. Fox reality tv is always a little bit shady!  Anyways, on a non-reality tv note, meant to get a lot more work done this weekend than I did. I guess I will just have to work extra hard this week. I need to email my independent study prof and let him know that I am working on things, he will just not have them til next week. My plan is to start my essay tonight. But first, my apartment needs some cleaning, especially the bathroom.  Welly, welly, welly, welly, well....that's about all that's going on in my life right now...  Book of the week:   White Oleander by Janet Finch Song of the week:   Toxic by Miss Spears :) hahah gotta love the pop princess Album:   For the ride Home...Josh Kelley, not new or anything but the cd is good. And he's pretty damn hot.                                    Check him out: www.joshkelley.com

      I don't even want to retype for a THIRD time the hilarious post I did last week because apparently I am a blogger moron and then some. And damn it was funny....so let me get everybody up to speed...me and Angelo are now dating...I would explain more but due to my own idiotness it just ain't gonna happen.  Anywho, just realized yesterday that project for editing class is actually due in TWO WEEKS and not in four like I originally thought. Well, I mean it is due then but we have to turn a draft into the class. What fun. So now I am in crunch mode and can hopefully get a lot of it done this weekend. Acutally, I have to get the whole freaking thing done this weekend. Why you ask, because I thought it was now due March 11 and really it's due March 4. Which is NEXT WEEK. AHHHHHHHH. Then something else is due the next week (we have to edit someone elses). OH MAN. Not. Going. To. Panic.

      Ahhhhhh!!!!! Angelo came into work today and called me a firecracker! hahah I am assuming that is a good thing!! :) Talked to SB for a little while on the computer. He was in a bad bad mood. And for real think that I am over over JS. For real. Like I think that I will always have a little thing for him, but not like it was before and not to the point where I am jealous when he tells me about other girls. But I think that I have been that way for a while about him anyway. Just thought i would write about it now so that my whole post is not about reality television once again.  Wanted to leave work early yesterday and of course the second I am about to leave I suddenly have all this work to do! But still managed to leave kind of early. But was way to tired to work out. So am going to go for sure on Thursday. Hmmmm, maybe I will even make a new cd. I am addicted to Napster. Eventhough you have to pay for it. I think that ebay is taking over my life and i don't even buy anything.  Things to do this week: get Jess a birthday present, find a valentine...just kidding. Think I am going on some sort of bar crawl for the big bad V-day. Ohhhh make cookies. I should do that and bring some into work. Good plan.

      Am so bored. Julia and Sarah are not at work today and neither is my boss. I think I might leave kinda of earlier today considering that I have already made stuff for next week. Just a matter of filling in schedules and stuff.   Hmmm need to do really really well on the editing quiz this Thursday. Am planning on studying tonight and tomorrow and Thursday since I am not going to work. Hopefully that will be better. V. Good plan.  Very tired too. Was hard to get up this morning and I am feelin kinda groggy. New Plan: must try to get to bed earlier and stop playing on ebay. I am addicted to looking at stuff not actually buying or bidding on anything.  Anyways, should probably go eat lunch. More later. Well, maybe I will wait to write when something exciting happens to me!!

      The weekend was good. Friday night decided to stay in and not go out in the freezing cold. Stef and I ended up ordering foord instead of going out and then she went to the party at Kincaids, and I ended up watching the movie the House of Yes. Which was very disturbing. Although Parker Posey was hilarious. The actual idea of twins sleeping together is just gross.Very Gross.  Saturday night went out with my sister. The plan was to get dinner, but we decided to just get drinks. We went to Tavern and then were rushed out of out table by these obnxious guys who claimed that they always sit at the table we were at because it is their lucky table. They were being SO annoying and kept asking us when we were leaving. And kept hovering over the table. So finally we were like screw it and left. Went back to her apartment for a little, then went and met some of her friends including Angelo!!! at Hugos. It was kind of funny to see him outside of work. But he is sooooo hot. Yum. We had a really good time, and I actually ended up getting drunker than I wanted and of course saw K. I know I know I am such an idiot. I need to figure out how to actually go out with Angelo just me and him. I think that he would be fun to hang out with!   Also, really need to figure out a way to convince Australian Steve that he should come here. However, it's so cold so it's a little hard to tell somone to come visit when it is snowing every five minutes. Plus he likes to snowboard and surf and not so much of that going on in the midwest. Hmmm well, maybe he likes to do artsy touristy stuff. Haha I could bring him to Springfield but that would probably be really boring.  Also, I decided that I need to send him a more recent pic of myself because the ones he has from when we met in Germany are like 3 years old. And plus I had been traveling for like two weeks and no one ever looks good after that!! :). If he did come visit though, it probably wouldn't be til March/April anyway, or maybe not til the summer. Which I guess is better because at least it will be nice out.   Ok well now that I have talked about the weather for this post, gee my life is so exciting!

      Oh man it has been a while. Got the editing project done. Well, done enough for the day it was due.   Also, I am totally stealing this idea, but on the website www.televisionwithoutpity.com (TWop), Kim, the girl who does the Real World recaps, does this thing called the "Most Awesomest thing she saw on TV last week" and it is freeeaking hilarious. So I am going to try and do that too. Only I am giving her all the credit and am openly admitting that I am totally copying her 100%.  So, the grestest thing that I saw on tv last week, well, actually I only saw like 15minutes of it but it was still great. It was this Lifetime Movie (on lifetime, not the move one) and it starred Laura Ingalls (Melissa Gilbert) and Maria Conchita Alonso, who I believe is famous for work out videos. Anyways, so the basic point of the movie was that Laura Ingalls and Maria Conchita were coctail waitresses (and totally white trash) at some WT bar. And Laura Inglass's boobs were popping out and she had really big hair. Anyways, basically she (Laura) has all these visions of a serial killer and who his next victim will be. So she is at work and has one and totally falls down and has a fit and then just pretends that she tripped so that the customers wouldn't get freaked out. And Maria, who was apparently suppossed to be her best friend, was like maybe they are not real and all this stuff implying that Laura Ingalls was crazy. I only actually saw up to that part but it was great!  Ok, nothing really else to report. More later. peace out.

      Sorry sorry sorry. I have been very neglectful of you, my poor blog. Nothing really exciting to report. Why is it that all guys SUCK?? Just been stressed out lately. Have lots of work for my classes and am graduating and need to find a real job but have until September but would like to find one sooner than later. The wondering if I don't find a job by the fall then I might go BUNAC and go to London or Australia but that's so far away and expensive to get to and no one will come visit me! Well, maybe they will. Ugh. Yes, I know, I could have worse problems. But right now everything little thing is stressing me out. I think the alignment of the planets is all funky or something.   I went to the Cubs game today...they won! yay! It was fun--but cold. Espeically cuz we got to watch Farnsworth practice pitching for a little while.   Hmmm, what else? Alias was KICK ASS tonight. Like sooo soo SOOO good. And the fact that I am actually writing about it in this thing just goes to show how lame and pathetic I really am.  Anyways, am trying to figure out a game plan. Hopefully things will fall into place and everything. And also, my plan invovled AS. But that part is going to be tricky. Very tricky.   So the awesomest thing I saw on tv this week...hahah TRISH from the bachelor. Seriously, I can't stand her but they way she acts and everything she says is just...awesome!! Also, for more TWoP stuff go here:  urlLink    aight. good night.

      Blah. SO bored. Don't really have a lot to do. And I need to ration my work so that I have stuff to do tomorrow. BV actually chatted with me for like a minute. Like he offered us these coupons for McDonalds milkshakes but I gave it back cuz it was for some orange shake (which is just so gross) but then he was like no, I think that you can get any kind. So I was like, "oh, you don't drink milkshakes?" and he was like "well, no, I mean I don't really go to McDonalds" and so of course I told him I didn't either. Then he gave me a high-five for coming to his show and for bringing friends. So I was like well, yeah, thanks for NOT coming to my birthday party! haha And he pretended to be all upset and then was like you're welcome. Then like 10 minutes later, I realized that I should have been like oh, thanks for coming (because he didn't) but whatever.  Anyways, he just walked by like two seconds ago so I had to pretend to be busy. Not that he was really looking, but whatever.   Ok, back to finding some more work for myself!

      Oh lots of things....went to the BV thing. He is SO cute. But he barely talked to me afterwards. Well, he thanked me for coming and touched my arm twice....ha ha. I guess that he is really shy from what other people have told me. Invited a bunch of people from work to happy hours at mcgees and no one came!! :( Didn't really think that they would. Not sure what I am doing for the 4th yet cuz everyone is going out of town. Maybe going to the taste to see Counting Crows/TMBG but not really sure yet. Anyways, lunch, but more later...

      crap crap crap crap crap. So now I am really thinking that he is going to think that I am stalking him if I go. Maybe I should stop looking at thim when he walks by. Well, I have been better about that today. But you know. Plus I don't really talk to him ever so maybe it isn't so stalkerish. I mean if I was in a band I would want people to come and see me and stuff like that. I wonder if Ed is going...that might actually make things better...or at least anyone from the office. Oh man. I need to stop freaking out is what I need to to. Bugger. Easier said then done.

      Ok part 2 of the first post. So BV has still not said anything to me about the band thing so I kind of feel stalkering going. BUT there is a sign on his door so I am assuming that he put it there so people would see it and then come to the show. Plus, I think that other people from the office are going. Well, I at least hope that they are!  Alright, less to add then I thought!!

      My birthday is tomorrow!!!! BV is in the office today, and I had to go ask him something nad of course I was all flustered and stuff and felt like an idiot even though I was totally trying to act all cool. It was just not working for me. Jill is going with me to hear his band tonight. Although I don't want to look like a stalker, but then again it's nice to support people you work with. I think we are going out to dinner before hand which is fine cuz then I can have some drinks before I acutally go. Just don't know what to wear!! Cuz you know I have to be cool/casual/look like I don't care but really actually put in like SO much effort. hahaha The joys of being a girl!

      Ok so BV is in the office today. Yesterday was the recruiter luncheon, and he was all dressed up in a suit and looked so hot. hahah Yes, I am both insane and a loser but at least I can admit it. So I posted something on tv withoutpity that had already been posted and feel like such an idiot cuz I totally got warned. Oh well. Probably won't be posting anymore!!  Anyways, reading this hilarious book (sort of trashy) called   One For the Money   but Janet Evanovich. There are ten of them all about Stephanie Plum the bounty hunter. It is seriously laugh out loud funny. I love being able to read books and enjoy them for face value as oppose to what the deeper meaning is. Maybe I am just burnt out from my English major days.  Okay, not much else to write. Figured that this would help me pass the time at work but I really have nothing much to say. Am most likely not going to Key West.

      BV is at the other office again today. Although he might be coming here but who knows. Tomorrow I am helping out at the recruiter luncheon so I think that he might be there. I am such a loser/borderline stalker. Seriously!! So I am waiting for my boss to come back from Kinkos so that we can make these things for tomorrow. Then hopefully going home. Not so much to do today. Anyways, hung out with JS this weekend. Was fine. I think I am for real for real over him. Like he was commenting about other girls and stuff and it didn't bother me at all. All though he dragged me out and I was so not in the mood to go out. But it was fine. Saw some people I haven't seen in a long time.  Ok, I will write more later! Bye!

      BV is not in the office today. Well, he is just not at the loop. He's at the LP office. Usually he splits his time up, but I guess not today. Hmmmm maybe I will run into him when I am walking home. Riiiight. Yes, thank you, I am fully aware that I need help.  So Kurt and I went out for drinks on Wednesday night. I gave him some shit but it was pretty much fine. Even though he doesn't think so...he is totally shady. Not the same shady as BC but still shady. And I really do think that we are going to be friends. He just needs to get over the I only hang out with my work friends situation. Like seriously they are all attached at the ass. Like, for me, personally, I would not like the people I work with (the exception of a few people who are pretty much on the same level as you) to know everything that's going on in my personal life. But he knows that. And I guess most of it is attributed to the fact that he moved here and didn't know anyone. But anyways, we might go out next week. And I was telling him about BV and he was all you should totally go for it...and it's like ok, I get that you just want to be friends but if I wanted to go out and mack on some guy, I will. Like I don't need him to urge me to do it. Like, get over yourself! heh. Plus, I don't think that BV looks at me in "that way." Although for like 5 minutes today I was like maybe I shouls send him an email and ask what he's doing this weekend. Or something. But I shot down that idea, because, emailing him, would not be good. My thoughts, he needs to make the first move. If said move is ever even going to happen.  Anyways, not sure what I am doing this weekend. Father's Day is on Sunday but my dad is still in Florida. So no big celebration for us. Also, one extra week to get him his present!!   Another great website to check out:  urlLink www.imdb.com  Although I am sure that most people know about this one. It's pretty popular.  Ok, back to work....

      Ok so maybe this time I can actually put in a website that will show up and that you can acutally go to. I am so technologically unadvanced sometimes, and I am not even that old. Not sure if I posted this earlier or not but Angelo are no more. Not that we were really ever but you know. 99% sure that he cheated. Because condom in the garbage that was for sure not mine...paried with his elluding to the fact that he used it alone while he was wanking off...pretty much equals bogus excuse to try and cover up cheating. At least if you are going to do it...cover it up better dude. I was so Nancy Drew that day. Plus when other people ask you about other girls in front of me...I'm going to put two and two together. So now he calls me way more then he did when we were dating or whatever you want to call it and always acts as though its such a huge deal that I never call him. I mean hello get a clue. I don't ever want to talk to you again ever. You know, not even sure why I dated him...  Anyways, have new secret work boyfriend :) My friend Sarah and I call him BV which are not his initals in any way but instead the initials of a character from a Nora Roberts book. I was reading the book at time of necessary making up code name in which case, that is what our not-good-at-making-nicknames asses came up with. We are SO original! heh. BV was on vacation for a few days but is back now so at least there is something interesting to do in the office. Well not so much as do as look at but whatever.  Alrighty, should probably get back to work. More later.  urlLink www.televisionwithoutpity.com  for all you people who are just as obsessed with tv and snarkiness as much as I am!

      I am such a stalker. Found his profile on this one online dating thing. Of course it hasn't been updated since last year and he hasn't even been logged in for like a long time. But it was still funny cuz I was certainly not really expecting to find it. I mean I was looking purposly to find it but didn't actually think that it was there.   So yes, I am officially a stalker. Well, not really since I don't like follow him around and stuff.   So bored today. BV is at LP for like this whole week. Which kind of sucks.   I am so bored I don't even have anything to write! I think that I am going to go home soon and start my new book. Then go to the gym/crunch training and then come home and watch I Love the 90s. Wow, so much excitement I can hardly stand it!!

      He was in the office before and is either at lunch or just gone for the day. No fair!! And I had a sort of do you want to go get Starbucks plan that only 1% was actually going to do...but still!!  Hmmm maybe I should email him. But what the hell would I say, seriously. Like hi, ok, I know this is really forward but do you want to go get a drink sometime. Yeah. Maybe not so much. I would rather not get shot down!!!  My plan is to go home and then go for a walk by the lake. I was going to go to the gym but figured that this would be more fun.   It is two degrees in the office.
