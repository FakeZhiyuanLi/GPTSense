      imagine the guiness commercial (if you haven't seen it check out  urlLink this site ).  -beating the lakers by 20.... brilliant -listening to all of the jack ass espn and abc announcers, anchors, analysts and radio hosts eat their words.... brilliant -holding the lakers to their lowest point total in the playoffs ever (again - it must be them - not our defense - funny how that happens every series - every game).... brilliant -holding kobe to one point (on a bs technical foul call) in the first half after he made 'the shot that would break detroits back'.... brilliant -having a chance to win the whole thing in detroit.... brilliant -not living in detroit when they burn it to the ground next week after we win.... brilliant -not drinking six beers at the same time.... brilliant  if you're not on the band wagon yet - its not too late to join. we'll even let you friends from colorado hop on... because the only thing better than watching us beat kobe will be watching him go to prison in your state next year.  :: cory

      my wife shelly turned 25 a couple days back and i hope she enjoyed herself.  she is one of those who reminds you 6 months before her birthday that she is having a birthday and then continues reminding at least once a week until it comes - so needless to say the expectations were high...  i suprised her with flowers at work and then suprised her again with some ear rings on our car ride over to dinner.  we ate another great meal at  urlLink san chez  - which in our opinion is one of the best tasting and most fun restaurants to go to in grand rapids.  --  :: cory

      well i've had this blogger account for a couple weeks now mainly in an attempt to get a gmail account (thanks to a gracious friend that goal has been accomplished).  usually i blog to  urlLink ideashift.net  but i thought i would give blogger a try today.  i'm thinking i would like to incorporate my blogger blog into me personal site  urlLink cdvander.net  (which is currently undergoing some major rennovations)...  if you are reading this and don't know me - that will (eventually) be the spot to find out pretty much all you need to know.  but for now to summarize - i am sys admin and programmer living in grand rapids michigan...  i love tailgating in ann arbor at university of michigan football games, watching the lions and pistons at the bar, camping, fishing, playing golf, and most of all - house music.  i have been quite distracted from working today due to the huge pistons lakers game back here in auburn hills tonight.  i haven't been this excited about a basketball game since i was about 10 watching the pistons and u of michigan championship runs...  it is also a blast beating up on the lakers and all of those obnoxious los angeles fair weather fans who don't understand why having 19 team blocks is so much better than anything shaq or kobe have ever done in any game...    enough on that for now - i don't want to get too worked up 8 hours before the game...

       urlLink  Pistons Rip Lakers 100-87, Win NBA Title (AP)  -  AP - Without a superstar among them and without being given much of a chance, the Detroit Pistons humiliated the Los Angeles Lakers 100-87 Tuesday night in Game 5 of the NBA Finals for their first title in 14 years.   [Sporting News]  a nice summer night, a bunch of friends gathered on the back porch with a half barrel, a television, and the pistons absolutely humiliating that JV squad from los angeles.  i don't think life can get much better.  thank you pistons.  thank you for dispelling the myth, for giving a collective finger to the laker hype, and for playing like we knew you would.  now i know why you didn't foul at the end of game 2 - you were giving us one more game - one more chance to spank the mighty lakers on your home floor - and one more chance for us fans to go nuts watching you do it...  thank you for a great series and a great playoff run.  you have brought some class back to the nba and another world championship banner back to the palace.  :: cory
