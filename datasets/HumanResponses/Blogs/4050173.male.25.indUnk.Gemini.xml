      So last night, I had every good intention to clean up my "flat", do some laundry and basically just get some stuff done.&nbsp; This did not happen, my friends.&nbsp; I, once again, got sucked into Lifetime... I need to stop.&nbsp; I thank God that Jess called me to discuss the happenings of Miss Courntey Love's trail... it took me away from this movie where this teenager is accused of killing some chick.&nbsp;   Anyways- just when I was about to get some shit done, "Amish in the City" premieres at 8pm.&nbsp; I HAD TO WATCH IT... and it was a 2 hour premiere.&nbsp; Can I just say that reality TV has totally lost thier screws and marbles, my friends?&nbsp; These 5 Amish kids between the ages of 18-24 are thrown into the middle of LA and live with 6 city kids... if you can call LA a city.&nbsp; It was freaking hysterical...&nbsp; One didnt know what a parking meter was, the other didnt know how to work a mailbox, and the other one I have to say, was kind of hot.&nbsp; I want to be Amish.&nbsp;   Speaking of LA, I am going on a little mini vacation in October.&nbsp; I got a hot deal on a flight and Im gonna go hang out with my friend Courtney for a couple days.&nbsp; I cant wait... I just may pee. My mom think I want to move there... Simmer down, Sue.  I was also talking to Matty Boombastic and we decided that we want to paint a mural of ourselves in the hallway in our Spaha apts.&nbsp; Do you think the neighbors would appreciate it?&nbsp; I think it would be rather shabby chic and basically, who wouldnt want to look at a mural of 2 gays skipping in a park setting?&nbsp; I think its fab.&nbsp;   I want to buy new curtains this weekend and possibly go shopping for some paint colors for my walls... my place totally needs a paint job.... Im thinking a beige color on the wall by my windows and a dark marroonish color on the couch wall, around the bathroom and closet and then only my overhang in the kitchen area... this will be a project my friends.&nbsp; However, I have all the supplies to paint thanks to hot Robs in BRAHLAAHHH.

      These blogs are only created for Christina, Mel, Robin, Sam and now me.&nbsp; Does anyone else look at these?&nbsp; When did these come about?&nbsp; Who created them?&nbsp; Mel- I suggest you do some research for me on this matter and send it to me from your job before Oprah online comes on.  Speaking of Mel, she just calls me to tell me that she just saw STONED HOBBIT AKA JOAN RIVERS!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; We discovered Joan's plastic face resembles that of a stoned hobbit when watching the Emmy's was it?&nbsp; I can't remember... All I know is that we strive to know that little hobbit better....&nbsp;   I also have the urge to go to Brother Jimmy's.&nbsp; I have not been there since the Blackout Incident about 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; Im a little scared.&nbsp; But I shall march proudly in there soon sporting my "Free Courtney" T-shirt while the bartenders scream "Here Comes Courtney Love"... God, I miss that place...  I wish it was Friday, my friends.

      What the hell are we really supposed to do on these things?&nbsp; Do I just sit here and blab on about what I am doing?&nbsp; If so, I am sitting here.&nbsp; I am completely surrounded by all this crap that I have to do and there is no desire at all to jump into it.&nbsp;  I hate the friggin rain... yet again, I get caught in the heavy rain when I leave work last night.&nbsp; Umbrellas are pointless and the architecture of this building really does not aid in wind resistance, so its like tornado winds within a 4 block radious of this friggin eye sore.&nbsp; As my friend Jess and I ran to the subway, I lost her somewhere in a puddle.. I am also becoming more and more addicted to "Lifetime, Telvision for Women....... And Jim".&nbsp; Last night I got sucked into this drama entitled "Going Underground" starring Mrs Seaver AKA Joanna Kerns... An abused wife who runs from her husband and takes her children with her.&nbsp; I was so enveloped in it that when Melissa knocked on my door, I almost fell off the couch.&nbsp;  Mel and I were talking about how we hated swim class in high school&nbsp; And if you were a boy like me, you TOTALLY hated swim class.&nbsp; I remember trying to think of all these excuses not to swim.&nbsp; There was this love/hate relationship with the changing room.&nbsp; I hated getting undressed in front of people, because those of you who knew me during puberty knows what a mess I was.&nbsp; I also couldnt trust myself in there, cuz you know I was sneaking peeks at the hoo hoo diddle diddle's that were flopping right in front of my face.&nbsp; And HONESTLY there were guys in there struttin thier shit and smackin each other on the bare ass getting boners... GOD I HATED HIGHSCHOOL....  What are we doing this weekend?&nbsp; I hope it does not rain, my friends.

       This has happened by accident.... I went to Christina's blog to view my witty advice that will guide her to a successful ending to her job.&nbsp; I go to post a comment in regards to whether it applies to all people in thier current job and all of a sudden, my friend, I have my own blog.&nbsp; I am utterly confused on how I got to this point.&nbsp;    First we all discovered text messaging, and then next thing you know we all have blogs...    Oh, and the main point that I was trying to make was this:   EVERYONE can tell all fellow co-workers to "take a shit".&nbsp; Its healthy I feel, if you deliver the line in a correct manner.&nbsp; I thought that it would be successful for Christina, because I know she can nod politely while looking up with the big blue eyes and casually utter that phrase... people would just simply think they are hearing things... hence, Christina wins.&nbsp; I do it all the time and everyone just thinks I am kidding because I deliver "Take a shit" in such a joking matter that everyone almost always expects it now... I am "The funny guy".&nbsp; What's your role in the office?

      Yes, my friends, I have not blogged in like 14 days.  However, today I went out to grab a sandwich and when I got back to my desk, I decided not to continue locating what specific mechanical equipment belongs to North Residential and how many man hours are put into each system quarterly, annually etc.  I made the choice to eat my lunch and check out the friends blogs.  Yes, I got some crap for it yesterday over email, but yet again, I give in.  I read Mel's interesting post on her friends religion vs. evolution which led me to Robins website on religion and dealing with the death of a friends mother.  I decided to take the test and share with you all as well- Here are my results on what religion best suits me: 1- Mahayana Buddhism (100%) 2- Neo-Pagan (97%) 3- New Age (93%) 4- Hinduism (87%) 5- New Thought (86%) 6- Unitarian Universalism (85%) 7-Theravada Buddhism (77%) 8- Scientology (76%) 9- Christian Science (Church of Christ, Scientist) (67%) 10- Taoism (60%) 11-Liberal Quakers (60%) 12- Sikhism (59%) 13- Mainline - Liberal Christian Protestants (55%) 14- Jainism (50%) 15- Reform Judaism (48%) 16- Secular Humanism (48%) 17- Orthodox Quaker (30%) 18- Bahá'í Faith (25%) 19- Orthodox Judaism (23%) 20- Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) (17%) 21- Jehovah's Witness (17%) 22- Non-theist (17%) 23- Mainline - Conservative Christian Protestant (14%) 24- Seventh Day Adventist (12%) 25- Eastern Orthodox (10%) 26- Islam (10%) 27- Roman Catholic (10%)  I found it very interesting that I was raised Roman Catholic and it least likely suits my belief system as an individual.  On that note, I've decided to try harder and blog at work during lunch.  I need to stop working while I eat and check out what is going on with the network of friends.  Today I learned about your interests and thoughts on religion and that Christina is at her first day of Law School.  You go girl!  This is hamishmyfriend signing off.

      I know I haven't blogged since Thursday, and Jen says I suck at it.  So this is for Jen's pleasure.  DONG.  This weekend was rather mellow for me, my children.  I did, however, reunite with Brother Jimmy's on Friday evening.  I did not get kicked out, cut off, or even blackout.  Mel and I are proud of ourselves for not letting ourselves get out of control.  They must of missed us because my bill was either $14, $16, or $18... Im not sure exactly what it was because apparently on my cab ride home on the phone with Matt i quoted many different prices... Oh well, it was a deal and Im all about that.  I have painted my apt. my friends.  Mel and I braved the humidity on Sat. and went to B, B and B (Bed Bath and Beyond).  Mel needed an AC and I needed some hoot new curtains and a dish drainer.  People in stores are annoying... they are even more annoying when the humidity outside is more than 90%.  All I remember is some old bitch in lime green pushing our shit out of the way to get to the ATM machine which she didnt even know how to operate.  We went to Gracious Homes and picked out a hot color for my walls, I helped Mel put the AC in her window and miraculously, she is back to her normal self.  Im not sure how much longer I could have tolerated sweaty, bitchy Mel... she's scary.  I woke up early Sunday morning to begin the paint project.  I got up at like 8, had a cup of coffee and decided to take the garbage downstairs before I began moving my furniture around.  So, yeah... I had the automatic lock on my door and before I realized it was locked, the door slammed... There I was... Stranded in my pj's in a humid hall with no keys, no cell phone... nothing.  Of course I hoped that neighbor Melissa who has a spare set of keys would be home, but no... she's at the boyfriends getting boinked.  At least someone was happy.  I debated on knocking on doors to see if i could climb out a neighbors window but it was 8am and I didnt want to wake anyone.  Then the genious in me struck-- "Go to the roof and climb down, Jim... thats a grand idea..." I say to myself.  I did just that.  Its pouring at this point and I have hardly any clothes on and really bad shoes...  I heaved myself over the ladder on the roof and began my descent down to my second story window.  I think people saw me pass their window, and I simply told myself they were lucky to see an ass like mine first thing in the morning to make myself feel better in the situation.  Finally, I got in.  Then I began to paint... ALL DAY.  It was a project, but it paid off.  I think Im going through paint fume withdrawl today, though.  I'm debating on going home and licking the walls....
