      Allison and Kate ended up coming over.  Meggie cudnt bcuz she has her behind the wheel tomorrow at 7:30.  Well we watched About A Boy it was good but a little drawn out, I fell asleep a few times but I got the general idea.  Then we played charades which is rele funny and then Drew came and picked up Allison an Kate.  I didn't do my spanish reading, i read about 3 of 15 pages.  That swing is too comfy, and it rocks a little so it's like ok u cant read like that.  The story I'm reading is boring too.  But i decided i will finish reading it tonite and do the questions tomorrow.  even if i have to stay up rele late. i mean how long can it take? 1 hour at the most...if it even takes that long (hopefully not).  who gets homework over vayk neway? cmon ppls.  and ok y is it getting hot out?  it was like in the 80s today!  isnt january sposed to b cold? sheesh.  cmon, pls b cold. cold is good. i promise!

      Hi.  Well today was pretty boring, my friends went to see Catch Me If You Can and I already saw it.  I would have gone anyway, but I was really sleepy and I would have had to get up right then to be ready on time, so I didn't really want to.  Well so far I've done chores and showered and watched TV, and after this i will have blogged.  I'm listening to this awesome song in Spanish that we played yest in the car.  It was great cuz it was me with my 4 guy cuzins and they were all singing along, and theres a part where it goes "VIDA!" (Means "life" and its talking to a girl like saying shes his life) and its like, the music builds up to it and then he like shouts it, and they wud all shout it with him.  It was really cute and funny, my cousins rock.  :( No one can do anything today.  We got a swing in the backyard, one of those long bench ones, so I wanted to have people over so we could hang out back there, it's awesome.  But yeah no one can...well maybe Alyssa can come chill for a while after church I'm going to call her and see, but my guess is she cant.  That's about it for today.  I'm still putting off my HW, maybe ill go out on the swing and do the rest of my spanish reading. That works...

      :( my cousins just left... I know it's late but they had to go cuz my uncle has to be there at 5am.  I'm sad...we were *bonding* :'(. Well my youngest guy cuzin (hes like 2 months older than me) came in and we were like talking about like...just a lot of stuff and then my next youngest cousin (just turned 20 but duznt act it....hehehe) came in and laid on the bed and added a few things to the convo and sometimes just grunted and made weird noises lol funny funny.  but yeah finally we got to talking and stuff and now I'm not going to see him for like 6 months.  gosh i love my cousins though.  they are so great...i'm really going to miss them.  what I said before about feeling out of place...yeah its kind of true, but when its just me and them its really nice and i feel really loved.  still though i think what i said about friends is true..theyre the ones i can totally be myself around and not worry about sounding stupid and stuff.  but still...theres something about these guys that makes me really happy and now im so sad because theyre gone and who knows when i will c them again?  im glad i have my friends :) though, i guess cousins and friends are both good in different ways.  gosh i swear im so corny but i gotta say wut im feeling so... it feels like this is a good ending though, like before i was kind of disappointed as u cud tell, like i was like why do i have so much fun with my cousins when most of the time i feel left out?  but now this time i remembered why i have such great memories of them, because they really are great. im glad, bcuz i was rele sad about that.  hmm. i think thats all for now.  g'night ppls (yeah at 3:16am.... ooo John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that none would perish but have everlasting life.  OK that doesnt sound right but i got the main idea. good verse tho.)

      I think I'm in a better mood now.  I'm going out to dinner soon.  Why do I still care about what's going on with X?  He's such a dumbass but for some reason I still waste time on him.  I just needa like see him and figure out wtf is going thru his head.

      Why does it seem like no one in this family really cares how I feel?  I mean I don't want like everyone as my servant but it just seems like my opinion never counts and I'm always putting up with sh!t so other ppl have fun and do what they want to. Bleep that, man.

        TRYING TO DECIDE ON TODAYS MOOD    Good things: I had a ton of fun at the party.  It's January 1st, 2003.  I have awesome friends.  My family is cool.  I have a job, very fun and easy (taking care of a puppy).  I smell good (So Pink from GAP).  I'm wearing my fav pants.  I like my hair today.  I laugh like I'm insane, and it's FUN.  We scare people.  It's warm outside.  My room is clean.  I'm stupid. And so are my friends :-P.  The doorbell just rang.    Bad things: I feel stoned or wasted...or both.  I'm sleepy.  I'm bored.  I must have gained 10 pounds last night. I look pale enough to be a ghost.  I did my makeup before putting in my contacts so I have to wear glasses today.  I can't find my bunny (aka my cat).  I didn't have neone special (a guy) to spend the holidays with.  I have homework to do (Spanish Lit and World Lit...agh its like all reading). It's warm outside.  No one's online.  I have time to make this list.

      WOW...I'm like so wasted right now.  And all I had was junk food.  We are so good, we went to sleep at like, 8, 8:30-ish!  We went outside and watched the sunrise too.  OK here is how the night went.  I got to Island's after everyone else cuz of my crazy insane day I talked about already.  So I get there and had my BIG WAVE BURGER i had been craving like FOREVER and wow we had some problems figuring out the bill but thx to allison our smart math person we did alright.  then we walked to starbucks (with kate talking about random things making me crack up "i dont eat pumpkins...they dont fit in my mouth") and then we got frapps and my daddy picked us up.  then we came back to my house and just hung out and had all these "deep" talks not rele deep hehe but more like just talks but it was kinda "stuff i only say in a close group of friends" talk but yeah it was just weird but interesting.  i found out lots of new info yay go me.  then we went to watch DUDE WHERES MY CAR (kate thx so much for taping that!) and I AM IN LOVE WITH ASHTON KUTCHER meg can totally have Sean william scott ill take ashton over him any day. ("...all rugged like ASHTON KUTCHER..." Meagan on Wakeup Wakefield-SNL).  Well that movie is like hilarious but incredibly strange.  Then we just hung out for a while, watched the MTV performances (avril!) and looked at magazines, went online, all that good stuff.  Then my poor kitty ran out of the room and I realized that him being the biggest scaredy cat ever he must have been terrified with 6 screaming girls in the room so I went and got him and put him in my sweatshirt and just hung out with him for a while.  poor little boy!  and then like i went back to the room and they were like "oo its 11:54!!" and i was like no that clocks ahead its not that late (cuz we have a clock thats an hour ahead) and theyre like no this is the tv clock and i was like WHOA how did time fly so fast?  so me and diane went downstairs to get the Martinelli's (pshh can u say trouble opening a bottle?? lol) and she served it up being the excellent bartender she is and we took it upstairs and counted down like the dorks we r.  then we screamed HAPPY NEW YEARS (feeling rele stupid, well i was neway) and "kissed" and YES the quotes r there for a reason. then we watched tv a little more (THIRD ROCK!) and all that good stuff until my parents company left and my parents went to bed, so we went downstairs.  we talked like forever, and then got bored and started playing things like monster chase, piggy back and horsey back races, watch diane pretend to be a guy and hit on arleen (haha we had a good time with this one), and all these random things.  ok so by now its like...4 maybe?  so we're like ok its late but were rele not sleepy so we start playing charades and its like were so insane and we're horrible at it! (sleepy sh!t, haha) like we wud say things that wud make NO sense and it was...rele entertaining.  so around 6:30 we decide to head out and see the sunrise but its pretty much already risen so we just froze and huddled under one blanket and watched the sky get brighter.  we came back in and decided to "chill" a little but by then laying down felt good.  so diane, kate and allison keep on playing charades and me and meg and leslie r watching some of them and guessing and sometimes just laying there, and around 8:30 i fell asleep for a couple hours but from what i hear, kate, diane and allison had a BIT of fun while we were asleep...lol. so then we wake up and them 3 r coming downstairs and theyre all ready to leave :( so i say byebyezies to them and we decide to head on upstairs.  then meg and leslie got picked up and that was the end. ooo..and SO much eating went on last night...im hungry but i feel too sick too have breakfast.  so yeah, now we were sitting around like all stoned and wasted (from sugar haha) and like my voice was SO deep and i was so like expressionless and out of it..wow. ok the end...happy new years guys.  i havent had a chance to try out my resolution but i already know one person im going to try it wth...so yeah.  i will let the blog know what happened so he can tell all of u :).  well this is like way long and u r all bored to death so yeah...i will let u ppls go. *STONED*

Then we went off to the shopping center even though it was freezing and starting to get dark.  On the way allison was being weird and riding in the grass and even up a hill she wasnt sposed to..i LMAOd.  Then we ran into Chris and his ex tina (i THINK its his ex..) they were out for a walk in the park (how lovely) ooo never mind meg just told me they went to Baskin Robbins and yeah so we talked for a little and it was weird like awkward bcuz we have all been mean to her online because she was mean to our friend roni.

      Haha ok, what I said about X blocking me...maybe not true.  Just now this other kid signed on and it showed that he had blocked me too, only my friend asked him and he said no, and I could still IM him, so it's probably some weird computer thing going on.  Go me!!! lol. Props to Allison and Meg for the evil old man laugh!  GREAT STUFF! We r funny no matter wut neone (aka some bleeps with with sticks up their bleeps...) says even if we're the only ones who laugh! HAHAHAHA!

      OK so i lose the bet i didnt come back last night.. but this morning waking up was like a horrible start.  well not morning, afternoon...but ok whatever.  Well it started out good, I got a call from a friend telling me that a person (lets call this person X..just cuz..) well X was online and I had been waiting for X to come online because I had a really important question.  Well, the program that I use lets me be on two screen names at once and because of that I figured out that X had blocked me! And I am like WTF I'm sorry but like I never did anything to this kid and now I am just mostly pissed because well yeah and kinda sad i mean i wish i at least knew why!  well ok, bleep X.  ok my other complaint is WHY ARE GUYS SUCH CRAPHEADS?  I mean ALL my friends are having guy problems and i am too.  it's hard enough finding someone worth my time (I'm not like stuck up saying I'm too good for people, but these days guys are only thinking of one thing and i dont want a guy like that) I wish you could just like read people's minds (well except people cudnt read mine hehe new rule) but ok no, i wish you could be like totally open with people.  like you meet someone new "hey youre pretty hott ur a cool kid i like u" "o well i dont like u like that sorry" THE END you dont even waste a minute on them!  or u know it turns out u both like each other so u dont go thru that whole "::giggle:: he looked at me" crap!  OK, if some of my guy friends read this it's not meant for you, because you guys are cool or else i wud like smack u :-P i think thats all i have to say for now...and a huge crap on X

      Hmm..I finally got a blog. I always thought these online journals were pretty cool and now I have one. Gooo me.  Thats ONE good thing this weekend.  This weekend has been pretty crappy, but I'm not getting into to much detail with that..just family stuff.  And its not even big problems, so if I say why it will be a big waste of time and everyone will think I'm a spoiled brat.  But I'm really not, just when a ton of little things build up and I'm already in a crappy mood I just feel like life sucks.  Well, my cousins were visiting last week, which was fun, except that my younger one tries to act like shes way older an she duz sometimes but then she's really immature a lot of the time.  My other one is my age but he always hangs out with my bro...he's still super cool though.  My cousins are all pretty great except that younger one, and thats because she's done stuff to me.  But thats all in the past so I'm not getting into it either...I've just learned not to trust her.  Well but then my cousins left and my brother went with them (to my other cuzins house for the next week), only I'm not allowed to go bcuz theres too many guys over there and my parents are weird about that, so I'm the only one on that side of the family whos left out.  Well, me and a five year old...but that doesn't make it any better.  And my parents are treating me like the servant girl or somtin today, so that just did not help at all.  And ok, my mom asks me whats wrong, why I'm in a bad mood.  I tell her, and she refuses to believe its her fault...somtin must have happened to me.  Of course mom, cause youre the all knowing one and im just a stupid little girl.  I mean if youre going to ask me then believe me, if not dont ask!  And my parents always do that.  OK, I said no detail but it's a little late...sorry but that's what the blog is here for i guess.  So yeah, like I said it's not a big deal, just a lot of small things making me feel like I dont really matter.  But you know what I realized?  My cousins are fun, my parents are OK usually, but my friends are the people I can really count on.  I mean this week I had fun with cousins and all, but a lot of the time I felt left out and like I didnt belong, and they were all leaving without me and it was like they didnt really care.  And then yesterday I went out with my friends and it was like...coming home. Like I was where I belonged and they never make me feel like left out or anything.. Geeze, I sound so corny, I've been kinda emotional lately...i guess.  I just wish people could understand what i feel...especially the ones making me feel that way.  Well...I think I'm done for now but I can bet I'll be back later today...or very early tomorrow (aka after midnight) so until then, have fun reading... *ME*

Me: y shud he b able to? lol ok well im done with that.   o SNL tonite with avril performing! MUST watch it, unless im like asleep by then but i probly wont b. mmm i have some hw to do too, i dont think ill be going out tomorrow at least not the whole time so ill just leave it until sunday night as usual (im rele trying to change this but i dont think its possible..lol) mmm...well i think thats about it *THE END*

      Gosh...I'm getting closer and closer to my younger cuz, the one who i said before i cant trust.  And I'm thinking about that the whole time but at the same time its nice to be close with her so i kind of ignore the voice in my head telling me to remember what she has done. I'm hoping shes not like that anymore...but I kinda hope that every time I c her and im proven wrong.  The only thing im doing right is only telling her what i want her to know. Sarah weren't you supposed to fly down and slap me or something if this happened? i think it was in an email or something but i think you promised me. can someone remind me how mad i was please?...........im so torn between just wanting to forgive and forget and move on...and wanting to hold a grudge and keep it between us forever so she cant do that again. advice neone???

I almost fell asleep in math well I didn't pay any attention near the end of the period cause I was half asleep and I was scared to fall asleep cuz this other chick was sleeping and he woke her up just to have her solve a problem and she was all lost an stuff. well, so then i was like falling over walking to core and there I pretended to read but rele fell asleep (it was planned, i lay my head next to the book and held the side up with my hand so it looked like i was reading that page...lol) and so i got rele good sleep but had a totally weird dream, i think i was smiling too cuz i woke up smiling i think..o an dont even ask about the dream, the last thing i remember was someone going "show me the love making!" or somtin it wasnt dirty tho somehow in the dream that meant someting else? wow yeah, and elizabeth like shook me awake an she was kinda laughing so i opened my eyes to her laughing at me so i laughed too, it was good sleep tho, core is pointless neway, 30min of reading? bleep that. so yeah i was better in spanish cuz of my little nap.  after skool i got to play with puppy and then i came home and slept a little which was good but wont b tonite when i cant sleep.  o well. then i can get some of my chem homework thats due friday done today so i dont have hours of HW tomorrow... so yeah, thats my totally interesting day im sure ur all happy to hear about it right lucky u..well chem hw is calling my name so i might blog later if theres anything to say if not g'night ppls

      First day of back to school. Ergh, very crappy.  SLEEPY.  Puppy was cute.  YAWN.  X sucks.  No homework tonight but I'll probly do some spanish reading so I don't have as much tomorrow.  SO TIRED.  Ohh I saw Anthony today after 2 WEEKS and he is on crutches :( Poor Anthony, I know how it feels! I hope he gets all better soon.  Ok, my little sarcastic comment today is why do people have to go everywhere in groups? I mean, in some places it's safer, and its more fun, but some people are like, NO, YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME OR I WILL DIE BECAUSE I CANT BE ALONE FOR MORE THAN 3MIN AT A TIME!  Sheesh. Well maybe I'm exaggerating but c'mon ppls be a little more independent.  Explore the world around you.  Ok maybe not but that but yeah, if you depend on other people that much what will you do when you're alone?

      wow, i hurt my back really bad in PE, it was already a little hurt but we were playing court hockey and i kinda got into it and from all the running and leaning over an reaching with the stick for the puck i hurt it so bad i can barely bend over, like, SITTING DOWN is painful... fun stuff.  so i iced my back for a couple of hours and then i was sitting up to see if i was any better when i got this HORRIBLE leg cramp i havent had one it a couple years right and all of a sudden i get it an its SOOO bad like i can feel the knot of muscles and the empty spot where the muscles shud rele b and im massaging it but it hurts like hell, and after a few minutes it hadnt gone away and i started crying (not like WAAH but like tears coming down my face) and i cudnt even sit up from the pain and u kno how ur sposed to pull back ur big toe when u get a cramp? well i was wearing slippers, an taking them off hurt way too much, so i just had to wait it out...it was so bad. mmm that test in chem wasnt so bad, i know for a fact that i didnt get 100% (i forgot nitrogen is a diatomic particle...who caaaares...lol) but im like pretty sure I got a high A. Like ill probly get a couple points off for the nitrogen thing but other than that i think i got everything right. in drama we performed our play, it went ok except we both had to call line a few times, i understand her cuz she had a few monologues but i just had short lines so i shudnt have had to...mm ppl said we needed to talk louder and show more...mmm im trying to think of the word it starts with a D...i think...but it means like the purpose for saying what were saying, i had them but i guess they werent real clear so yea. well good thing it was only first runs cuz we have a lot to work on... mmm i think that was my day..well everything interesting (or not) that happened....

      ok quick blog wutever i can write in the next 10min cuz the rest of my day will most likely be devoted to studying and puppy walking. ok well yest after watching the puppy i came home and sat down in the living room and studied until like 6 when my dad came home and said lets go jogging. i said ok let me just finish this up so he went and changed and ok comes back an turns the tv on an i mean ok yeah i kinda camped out in the living room but sheesh theres a tv upstairs and then he keeps talking to me about wut hes watching an im like mhm..yea...so then i finished up wut i was doing and went an changed an went jogging. then came back, kept on studying and then had dinner. then chelsea and leslie called (at different times) so a lot of my night was gossip/study cuz we wud go off talking about stuff an then come back to math. so ok my bro calls around 7:30 an says hell b home at 8:30. around 9:30, hes still not back. my parents r so worried or mad or somtin that they take it out on ME, like yell at me over incredibly stupid things an then my mom made me call like every person he ever met in his life to see if they saw him today and its like 9:30 ish an im waking ppl up, im like why dont u do it? i mean its not like i have freakin finals to study for or anything... so yeah then he came home finally and leslie called about the same time an i was trying to help her an my mom was like HANG UP AN GET DOWN HERE an i was like wut y? an shes like JUST DO IT NOW so i did cuz i figure it was important an my dads all "wut time did ur brother say he wud b home?" an i said 8:30 an then i stood there for like 5min wondering wut was so important i was called down an he finally turns to me an says ok u can go if u want. THX FOR BEING SO BLEEPING CONSIDERATE. and then i washed my hair (rele late by then cuz it took me a while to finish studying hmm wonder y) and my mom comes an yells at me to go to bed and then i was online for like 10min an my parents were liek WHAT ARE YOU DOING GO TO BED an i did an like a half hour later my bros still up an my parents r like dear its time for bed. i mean WTF the one who spends all day first earning money, then studying, then trying to not bleeping yell at them for being jerks (and succeeding) gets yelled at like shes a bad kid and the other one whos out all day, doesnt study, comes home way later than he said with no explanation an practically made them crap their pants gets a lecture, no punishment...an thats about it... wow life is awesome isnt it? and ok this morning i had to make my own sandwich, i wudnt even give a crap except my bros lunch was already made an packaged (and not by him obviously) i mean yes i think its wonderful my parents love him and treat him great, but why do i get the crappy end of the stick? (i think the expression is short end but mine makes more sense) and ok so after like 4 or 5 hours of math studying i think i bleeping didnt get an A on the test so i wont have a bleeping A in the class an there goes my 4.2, probly even my 4.0 cuz i dont know if ill have As in every other class EEEEEERGHHHHH ok time to walk the dog. maybe ill tell him all about my piece of bleep day an he can sniff me an make it all go away. ok there u go theres my crappy day sorry if i bored u byebyezies

      ok im gonna start this off in a good way bcuz...well read on the one good thing that happened today is i got an A+ on my drama final (a scene i did with anu) and its the only A+ out of 3 classes now...the bad... ok well im rele not in the mood for details plus i dont have time bcuz i have about 50 craploads of HW..so just in general this is wuts going wrong well first ive just been rele feeling like im only here for other ppls entertainment or wutever and i dont rele matter..like ok an example (maybe a little detail but trust me theres a LOT more) last night i guess my mom had hurt her hand so ok, im doing HW and my bro is playing soccer with my dad after having friends over and its like 10, and my mom asks me for help with the laundry. ok, do u bug the kid whos doing HW or the one whos playing soccer? and i was like ok sure but i told her all this and she goes o but hes gonna fold the clothes..(guess what. he didnt. she did.) and so i kinda rolled my eyes cuz i knew that wud happen an i did it neway, then i go back to HW, chatted online for about 10min, then went to bed. not even a minute after i turn off my light, my mom asks me to get her a hot pack for her hand.  ok, my dad is in bed next to her watching tv, my brother is still up doing HW, but nooo, she waits until I turn off my light (and u can tell when my light is on or off from her room) and then asks ME to do it. by then i didnt even bother i just did it. ok this might not seem like a very big deal, but this is one small detail in a whole line of things, and its not just with family. the next thing thats getting to me is the whole meggie-kate deal and even tho i decided not to take sides it seems like they both think im siding with the other (ok i just talked to kate and it looks like this is getting a little better) but yeah when we have all this drama going on u cant do nething without at least one person being upset with u and its so....i dunno sometimes all this seems so petty compared to other ppls troubles. ok, next thing is HW. it seems like 2nd semester all my teachers decided to pile up the HW and give me some more stress. like, no joke, now i have at least 2 hours of HW a night (even on my 2-4-6 days when i have PE, chem and drama and my only real HW is chem, i start on my hw for other days so i can like..not die.) i dunno this is all rele getting to me and im probly PMSing too or somtin but like ive been trying to blow it off an focus on the good things that happen but its just getting worse and i dont know how much longer i can handle it.........i dont mean this in a suicidal way or anything but something has rele got to change here...

      hey guys well yesterday was really fun, after lax me and meggie were going to go watch the guys lacrosse game (since we wud both be off practice at 4:30 or so, her from track and me from lax, and the game was at 5:30) well, there was a baseball game going on while i was at practice, and it wasnt over for a while after, so me and meg decided to watch the game until the lax game started.  (more like i begged her to so i cud, as brandon puts it "watch man ass"...those pants are very nice fitting on certain people :-P) well, after a couple innings we went to the stadium to get her stuff and to tell dylan (her lax friend) that we couldnt go to the game because her parents wanted her home earlier.  we saw him on the way down an he was holding the string they use for lining the field, and it looked like he was um...having some fun..with himself ;) lol, it was great, soo funny. well she told him she cudnt go an he said "i hate you" (joking) so she was like well...i watched you set up... an he goes ooo thats arousing and im LMAO thinking "you have NO idea.." LOL, it was great well we went back up but we didnt wanna b like o we cant watch the laX game, but we're gonna watch the baseball game so we sat by this pole and talked until the game was over (watching from far away) her parents were gonna pick us up at 5:30 so we were just waiting until we had to go to the front (and hoping some more man ass wud walk by ;) well i was, anyway) one of my baseballer friends walked by, an he always makes some comment about me hitting ppl in lacrosse and he was like "how come your name wasnt in the paper for hitting ppl?" an i was like "how come i dont see YOU hitting anyone?" (lol, yeah, cuz u hit ppl in baseball..) but yeah it was funny or i thought it was anyway, lol well then i went home an went online for a little but then i took a nap, then my mom woke me up since i was on her bed and i just flopped down on my bed and fell asleep again, i woke up a few times but i pretty much slept until 5:45 when i woke up, and it did me a lot of good to sleep that much.  today i had an ok skool day, went to christian club (i wanna b an officer next year so i needa start going again, an i picked a good day too cuz they took care of that stuff, nominations an all, today) and then after skool i had lax, it was fun but we did wraparoud drills which i dont like bcuz theyre not realistic, things are way different in a game, and plus thats not how i play and i dont wanna injure ne of my own teammates, and i just get bored with it. sean taught me how to really launch the ball, which i need because if i get the ball i wanna get it as far up field as i can.  when we did wraparounds, i played mostly defense (since thats wut i play in games) and i got hit twice when ppl shot, once in the ankle (and now my shins, ankle and feet hurt and i have a little bruise) and once square in the chest.  the chest hurt more at the time but its totally gone now, but like right then i was like "o mother--" and i like walked off a couple steps cuz i had tears in my eyes but like a couple min later i was ok well, after that i came home and then i ended up talking to kate for a while, we started out being pretty bitchy but then she said she wanted to just have a serious convo so i agreed and we like talked it all out, except shes insisting that our being friends just wont work and i cant get her to change that, and i did say i would leave this up to her so i guess this is pretty much it. thats about all thats going on as of now...i shud go do hw soon since i cant fall asleep like last night until i get it done geeze it looks like its like...5 and its 7 g'nightz kids luv, arleen

      Well, my birthday is in 14 days and I have no plans for a party.  My parents refuse to do absolutely anything cool or even make an effort to do something I want to do, it's just like if they don't feel like it, then NO.  I'm sorry but you would think when you have a good kid (not to sound conceited bcuz its not that great but its good for parents) you trust them more and try to show your appreciation?  I mean, seriously, like so many people go and get drunk or high and I'm the one preaching to them about how bad and how dumb it is, but they have WAY more trust from their parents than me.  I'm also the one insisting on taking 3 AP classes when even my parents are telling me it's too much.  I know it sounds like I'm talking about how good I am, but there are downsides to it.  I can't go out and party because what's the point, everyone's just going to get drunk.  I'm gonna have like no life next year but I know it's an important year.  It's just so many people are horrible kids and their parents let them do anything, even after they catch them doing something.  It drives me insane, especially lately.  Also, this whole week ive been sleeping on this crappy futon in my brother's room because my grandma was sick and what she had was contagious (i forget the name of it) and she was sleeping in my room.  Yesterday I was doing HW in my room and my dad comes in and yells at me about how I have to change my sheets, I mean thanks for caring about me getting sick but yelling at me over it is kind of pointless and stupid, since I didn't do anything wrong anyway.  This morning I was wearing these shorts (ive worn them before, they're really cute) and he was like no way you're going to school in that, you know better than that, blah freaking blah... I mean, he was there when I bought them.  I hate when my parents buy me something and later on tell me I can't wear it to school. ("You can wear it to the beach"-my mom.) Um, thats wonderful and all except I go to the beach about 5 times a year, if even that much.  I really don't need 5 pairs of shorts (3" inseam! thats like as long as they get unless I buy guy shorts!) for the freaking beach!  GOD my parents drive me insane.  Yeah, the thing with my birthday party is we can't get a hotel room for a sleepover unless my parents get one next door (because we're going to....what? get drunk off martinelli's like at new year's?) because we're "underage".  Most overage ppl would do a lot more than I was planning on doing..(especially since I wasn't planning anything).  Sorry I'm sure I'm boring most people but I am just SO sick of this, WHAT can I do to get some trust?  It's not like I can stop doing something bad or start doing something good because I'm already there, and I'm sure when I'm 35 my parents will let me have my own hotel room without them next door but IT WONT MATTER THEN.  ERRRGHH, it's like ever since i was little my I've been "too young" for stuff, and I guess that was understandable, except now i'm not too young for stuff and my parents still think i am.  well im pretty much done here but yeah i thot i wud let everyone know that being good dzunt pay off *Arleen*

      The lacrosse game yesterday was super awesome, we played JV and lost (which is kind of a relief considering theyre next years varsity) but it was close, 6-4, and for once i got kinda beat up but its ok im fine, and i gave out some nice bruises so its good.  my friends came to the game too and cheered for me "101 is #1!"-kate. lol.  then we went to pazzos for dinner and ended up sleeping at megs.  then this morning i had to go to this college fair at UCSD which was a total waste of time and getting up early bcuz i wudnt consider ne of the colleges there except UCSD, but i knew that before i even went.  then i wasted a whole afternoon doing nothing an then ppl came over an we watched the hot chick, which is super funny.  it was a good day. i still dunno wut to do for my birthday party, so if u have any super cool ideas let me know! lol *Arleen*

This morning, my parents gave me a teddy bear, balloons, and a card when i woke up, then Kate took me to Starbucks and bought me a caramel frappuccino...yummm. Then I got to school and Christina came and gave me a teddy bear and a cute card, and then Alyssa came and gave me a card and HOME MADE choc chip cookies yummmm.  Then I went to PE, yay yay.

(For example, a "Look" bar, then "Arleen, you're Sixteen!" haha).  The balloons had a card from allison apologizing that she cudnt b here (disneyland) and the poster was from chels, and there was a card on the seat from kate.  the card was of a kitty coughing up a hairball-lol, a lot cuter than it sounds.  well, then i went to chem and everyone i saw in core, during passing period, and in chem, had to read the poster, lol.  then at lunch i got B&BW stuff from heather and a hug from my baseballer friend.  then, 6th per, i got pink roses from my "boyfriend" meggie...haha, it was rele cute.  then josh drove me home cuz my bro had to go to the dentist and meg an kate came over and we went to the shopping center. lol at baskin robbins the guy asked if i wanted sugar or cake cone and he asked me weirdly tho, like it was a huge choice, so i did this weird face at him and said "shhhugar" like....well i dunno, just like dramatically and i guess kinda like suggestively, lol.  it was pretty funny.  well then we came home an my parents took me to dinner at black angus (yuuummm) and i came home and did hw and the end!!!

      Hi.  To let you all know how my wonderful lovely morning went...well I wont go into too much detail about the beginning but I was woken up like 5 times by my family for like no reason at all.  Then my mom went to breakfast with her mom, and my dad woke me up to yell at me for not having done anything for Mother's Day.  First, it is 9am, how duz he know I dont have a dozen roses hidden in my closet?  I mean I didnt, but still, if i had...lol ok thats weak i know.  But ok, second, he asked why I didnt get her anything and told me how disappointed he was.  I mean I went shopping WHEN? And I am HOW broke? (Not in the last couple weeks and VERY) And I mean, yeah I could have planned on going, but its not like i can drive anywhere.  ("Hey mom, will u take me to buy ur present?") But, being half asleep and not rele wanting to get into it, i nodded and did this weird "mmmm" sleepy noise.  THEN, my dad goes off on me about talking back to him bcuz hes right an blah blah, and i was like no i wasnt saying anything besides mmm... sheesh.  Then my dad was about to leave and thot of more to say so he turned an came back and i got another round of it.  I swear, my dad shud b a preacher.  He has these total sermons.  Its like even when I agree with him on somtin he has to explain why and go on and on and on.  Oh, and my last complaint on this is, how much duz he think i care that hes disappointed?  I get a 4.0 and he asks why I got a B in one class(i have AP spanish), I clean my room and he asks why my desk is still messy, its like theres no way to please him so i stopped trying like 10 yrs ago, so his disappointment is kinda just there not rele affecting me.  I'm still "good" but its for me not him, bcuz im the one thats gonna get into college with good grades, etc. Anyway ya that pissed me off.  Other than that i went to the mall with my bro to get my moms present (We got her estee lauder makeup she wanted and even tho i didnt buy enuf for the free gift the lady gave me two for being "such a nice girl" haha!) I know I said i dont care hes disappointed, an i dont, but i know my mom wud b rele sad if we ignored mothers day, so i figured we shud get somtin.  Other than that I've been doing HW, i have this project on Guatemala (where i was born) and omg I had to do history of it and its sooo horrible, they had this rele bad civil war and this dictatorship and so much stuff, and this is around when my parents were alive, its no wonder we moved here.  Yeah, and mothers day dinner tonite, where were gonna surprise her with her gifts and roses and card yay how touching... back to homework *Arleen*

      OK, its been a few days since i wrote.  not a lot has gone on tho.  my weekend was fun but nothing too special happened, just the basic movie night, homework day crap.  yesterday in spanish me and rita made darren a license plate that said "DARBEAR" and then the frame said "I'd rather be a bear" haha i taped it onto his license plate, it looked rele great.  then today skool sucked as usual and then afterskool was our lacrosse fundraiser at islands and i got my bro, josh, and tim to go (except i ended up paying for most of it) but it was worth it, those kids are sooo funny i swear. lol.  then i hung out with the lax chicks and we handed out flyers in front of islands.  ok, our approach to most ppl was "excuse me? would you like to help out our lacrosse team? it wont cost you anything, all you have to do is show this flyer to your waiter and we get 20% of the proceeds. thanks SO much!" (this was once i got good at it, my first ones were more like "um, excuse me, um, if you show this paper to your waiter, we get 20% of your, like um...bill" haha) but yeah that was only a couple ppl, except some ppl with sticks shoved very far up their asses complained that we were "soliciting" and "being pushy" and i mean sheesh i cudnt have been more polite and sweet, so it ended up being we cud stand outside but we cudnt even greet ppl, the only way we cud give em flyers is if they asked about it, so it kinda sucked.  the good thing is some ppl from skool showed up which is cool cuz most ppl dont give 2 craps about their skool teams.  still i think we made a lot of $$ bcuz we put stacks of flyers (we only had a pile like 5 inches thick, lol) in the movie theatres, in oscars, and in islands by the desk where u go to get seated.  then i came home, went jogging (got shinsplints dammit), an did all that other stuff u do after skool.  i think thats about all thats going on for now.  exciting life huh.  tomorrow is the spanish field trip to some restaurant, and then after skool the spanish class is gonna come over and were gonna shoot this video for our project.  ahhh so much to do.  im SO glad, my english teacher moved back this big city project we have due soon. 3 day weekend coming up.  who else loves hallmark for making up random holidays as a way to make money?  maybe memorial day is a little less random than most, but who actually cares wut the reason for a day off is??? well, i shud go...g'night all *Arleen*

      ok, well it is tuesday night...i got some more hw to do but i'm taking a little break.  omg i drank 3 bottles of water straight down, like all in a 15min period and i got a stomachache but im a little better now.  lol just thot id share with everyone. this weekend was sooo scary, we were out at like midnight bcuz we were spending the night at someones house (it was me, christina, meggie, allison, kate, chelsea) and we were walking to...cause some "mischief" (haha, im keeping this vague on purpose) so we're walking all over and we see this blue explorer (beginning of license plate is 3X) go by like 3 times so we were like wtf but wutever and we kept going.  so then we were maybe a block or two from the house and 3 of them decide to turn back so then only 3 of us kept going, and OMG all of a sudden 2 police cars drove by and there we are with all our "materials" stuffed up our shirts but i guess they had someplace better to be because even tho we're breaking curfew and all then ignored us.  well, right behind them comes the blue explorer so were all like hoooly sh!t right only this time they pull over and one of em goes "heyyyy baby girl, wassup?" and we were like ooo SH!T SH!T SH!T right so we went into the doorway of a house and just kinda hid in the darkness but omg i was sooo scared they wud get out of the car and come over, but i guess they figured we cud wake up the ppl who lived there so they didnt.  they kept calling but we wudnt come out so the guy growls like sooo evily, he was like "GRRRR" and he took off, so we all look at each other and meg goes 1...2...3... and we take off sprinting for the house and meg's ahead of me and kate bcuz i wasnt too scared, i figured they were gone. well, they turned around and came back and kept calling at us as we sprinted into the house, and when we were all inside, they squealed off again.  it was weird, i mean we were all really scared and breathing hard (not bcuz of the sprint rele, but mostly from being scared), but i was really not that scared. like it scared me cuz the 3 who had turned back said they did bcuz they had a bad feeling, and then the 2 who were with me said yeah somtin felt off, and we were talking about how women...or girls...females wutever, have a rele good sense of when things arent right, so it scared me that i was just totally confident and just having fun, ykno? Chels was saying it might just b bcuz im Christian and i know God is there and all, but bad stuff still happens to Christians....i dont know. yeah, it rele duznt sound as scary retelling it, bcuz i remember when chels told me wut happ to her (got chased by a truck) i was like ooo..that sux, but it didnt sound as scary as it rele is.  but yeah, at the time, ur thinking about all the things they cud do to you (not to make a list but rape is an example...and theres many more with all the sick ppl there are) and it was so weird driving down that same street the next day and its all sunny and i have nooo idea what was so scary the night before.  gosh, i dunno...but i do know im rele stupid for putting myself there, not to say i wont go out at night or something but if you see a car drive by a few times thats a good reason to go home.  well im about done...just wanted to share with everyone... g'night all

      Hey grrls and guys!  (haha) well my stressed outness is going down, except my 4.0 went down to about a 3.5 (maybe a lil higher, doubt it tho) but im over it, theres nothing i can do but kick myself in the ass, which ive been doing for a while now.  still, with getting all the bleepin skool stuff over with im a lot happier, i took my math and pe finals today (ran the mile for pe, lol) and tomorrow i have spanish (its AP so our final was the test back in may) and chem but i studied for that and i feel confident enuf...sorta :) except theres no way i can get an A and it wud b rele hard to lose my B so i think im good.  I'm mostly stressed about my Drama final, as weird as that is...i have to do two monologues and it has to be the best thing ive done all year, esp cuz we've been working on them for the past 6 weeks (of course, me an tara m. sneaking out of class every chance we got didnt help much...) but i think ill do...alright... its a pass/fail grade (either 200/200 or 0/200) and i doubt ill bomb so badly i'll fail. 2 more days of skool, actually one since theyre both half days, lol.  and then on saturday....SARAH GETS HERE!  It's insane, I havent seen her in TWO years!  AHH I'm excited :)  I text messaged her today just to say "3 more days!!!!!!!!!!" lol cuz im a loser like that.  i went swimming at chelseas today, i went home and fell asleep first and then around 1 they called and asked if i wanted to go so i made brudder drive me and then i went home around 4:30 or so, and my dad was home from the hospital (surgery) so i went to talk to him and stuff for like a half hour, then i went and made him soup and signed online for a few minutes, and it was insane bcuz it was only 5:30! i know that sounds weird but on a full skool day i cud never have done all that and had time left to study, after that i made my cheat sheet for chem and did this coin 3 thing, then watched like an hour of TV and had dinner, then washed my hair and here i am. and yeah im sooo tired and my back hurts.  just two more days.........ill make it... night all *Arleen*

      wow, bbsitting again from 10-5 ($42) which is good cuz of the money and stuff and its not like i do sooo much besides hang out, but im getting a little tired of the one 2 yr old for 7 hrs routine, lol. well, this time sarah is coming with me and even tho she duznt think so, shes really good with kids, and even tho shes just coming so shes not home alone for 7 hrs, im sure it will work out pretty well.  i think the whole paying thing might be weird bcuz they might feel like they have to pay us both but i think if anything, we shud split it bcuz its 2 sitters and one kid, so its not like the 2nd one is rele necessary and stuff, but yeah i hope that works out ok.  so yeah, just thot i wud post some new and exciting stuff on here...lol.

      well, its about two weeks into summer and so far its had its ups and downs.  sarah got here the day after skool let out, and we went to the mall that day just for some shopping.  i got a cute little sweat-vest thingie from Forever 21 and a cute roxy tank from pac sun...ON SALE... haha im all proud :). then sunday was my cuzins grad from college and then we left for camp.  it was good but pretty miserable, with tons of mosquitos and 4 kids (with 3 of them crying most of the time) to take care of...mornings were good bcuz we had day camps and we wud work with 3rd and 4th graders and they were fun.  still, it ended up being a rele good experience, like not to be corny but just it was a good thing to go thru.  then we got back and the next day sarah went off to sea camp for a few days.  then sunday...umm, as weird as this is i dont really remember sunday... well then monday i had my driving test :) but right after i got my license i had to go look for this place where i was gonna get my physical done the next day so my dad (who was with me) cud b sure i knew where it was an stuff but we cudnt find it and it took like 2 hrs so we were both rele irritable and he started yelling at me cuz i was getting rele confused with turns and stuff bcuz i was sick and my head felt about 2ft wide and i was rele tired and sleepy...so then i went home and i was rele not happy but then i went to islands with meggie, heather, chris and gino but i guess was a misunderstanding bcuz of ppl who didnt go and that turned into a big thing but it got better and later that night i had to go get gas and kate had to go to Vons so we met up for ice cream :) yummy... then tuesday my bro took me to my physical (my dad didnt want me going by myself since i didnt do too well the day before) and then...umm actually im kinda blank on what i did tuesday, too.  actually, i...ooo i went to meggie's house w/ kate and just chilled.  wednesday i had to babysit all day but after i got off i went to chelseas and there was some more drama but thats all cleared up now too. went to oscars for dinner with kate and then home.  then thurs had to babysit again and got off while the kid was napping to go pick up sarah, then came back and finished the job.  ($78 total, with 6hr shift wed and 7hr shift thurs...lol) then that night me and sarah went to islands for dinner and then she was still hungry so we went to in'n'out for fries (and it was a total adventure getting there, lol) ooo and the whole time we had the windows down an we blasted backstreet boys, and as we were leaving in'n'out, there were like 20 guys outside, and i drove by at like 5miles/hr and blasted it (and sarah danced, haha) and they all started dancing only it was like...how u wud dance to rap..LOL it was great. then today we were stuck here all day bcuz we didnt have a car to go anywhere but then my dad came home and i was happy to have a car, except it turns out he was going jogging at the lake so he just dropped us off at meg's an we hung out for a while with her and brandon, and then my dad picked us up and we changed and went to in'n'out for dinner, and then the ice arena w/ meg, heather, jerrin and gino.  it was fun except we CUDNT skate (got the hang of it by the end) and the others were pretty good at it.  then since i had to be home at 10, we left at like 9:30 and stopped by Vons to get ice cream (yummm) and then came home and watched monty python and the holy grail...OOOMMMGGG the MOST random movie ever and now its over and here i am and you are all caught up on my life. and since u just read this whole thing, maybe u shud get ur own. :) night all Luv, Arleen

      wow its been forever since i blogged, and now ive been commanded to do so.... well a ton has happened so i really dont feel like going into all of it.  summers had its ups and downs but its been overall really good.  I went back to forest home last week and i had a really great time, i had good kids and i worked with the same 3rd and 4th grade day camp which was fun, and plus the leaders are really great.  we got tile flooring put in downstairs (which is why i was at camp, so i wudnt wander around in PJs w/ workers in the house, ew). umm what other big stuff happened... o alyssa's bday party was at disneyland and it was a lot of fun.  ooo and Pirates of the Caribbean came out and its SOOO good and johnny depp and orlando bloom are sooo sexy.  at disneyland me and chrissy bought swords, earrings and eye patches and had a great time being pirates and swordfighting all day.  and today is chrissys bday so we went and decorated her room all birthday-y and left a weird pirate note for her since she had to work 9 hours, we decided to make her bday a little specialer.  my brudder came home from camp today, he was at this aviation camp in alabama and although it was rele cool having a car for a week i did miss my brudder and im happy he's back. (savvy?) mmm wut else.. well i signed up at 24 hr fitness so i can work out n stuff. mmm i dunno wut else there is to blog about.  ooo alyssa got her license and car, awesome stuff right there.  i hate summer reading, its stressing me out, i needa finish Last of the Mohicans so i can move on to my other 5 books.  actually, i wudnt mind it AS much if i didnt have to read america at 1750.  that is the most horrible book ever written in the history of the world!  mmm wut else is there to tell.  i had one little summer crush that i dont really want to go into detail about because im paranoid, lol, but he is really hott and cool and all that good stuff.  i dont know when ill see him again and as lame as it is im gonna miss him, besides the whole crush thing like he was just a lot of fun, and yeah i probly wont see him for a year. ummm i dunno wut else to say.  shud i get a perm?  let me know what u think, i really want it either like crimpy waves or like how jennifer garner has it in daredevil.  ooo speaking of movies, the texas chainsaw massacre is SO gory, ew! its the one scary movie ive ever turned off in my life.  oh and hand massages feel SO good, they totally relax you.   i think thats about it for now, u all are up to date an all that good stuff....goodbye and goodnight!

      well we went to see freaky friday (me, chels, chrissy and allison).  its cute and funny but not that great overall, lol.  i drove chels and on the way home we discussed parents and how much they can get on ur nerves. i was just saying they dont take me seriously at all, like if i try to discuss somtin with em and compromise, theyll sit there and nod and agree and absolutely nothing will change. i just feel like their little barbie doll bcuz i mean, ok ill admit im pretty spoiled, but i get new clothes bcuz they like "dressing me up".  its just when it comes to taking me seriously no one takes a doll seriously.  and it pisses me off that ive worked so hard in school just for them to decide where i go to college.  i mean the whole stanford harvard thing, i know that sounds totally bratty but its not about the actual skool, its just the fact that my dad is basically forcing it on me. i guess i sound rele spoiled but its just so frustrating.  o well, i have a year or so to work things out.  summer readings calling my name.  night all

      wow, my parents crack me up and annoy me at the same time.  my dads been bugging me all summer for dressing too "casual"-as in shorts and a tshirt.  well ok, lets take into account that this is NINETY degree weather.  not exactly a good temperature for dressing up.  now lets look at the fact that i am SIXTEEN.. and most (normal) people my age wear shorts and t-shirts daily.  like today, for example, i was going to alyssas house, and i'd been shopping, at the pool, and at the gym all day.  so i came home, showered, and i put on my light blue comfy shorts with my blue lax tshirt.  besides the fact that i was just going to her house for like 3 hours, i was tired and just in the mood to be comfortable. of course my parents were like freaking out and having cows bcuz i wasnt wearing a prom dress.. my dad was like "you dress like you dont own anything better..." and im thinking ooo no alyssa will think all i own is some comfy shorts and a tshirt, bcuz thats OBVIOUSLY what kind of fashion statement I'M making.  so i just kind of ignore it and wear it anyway.  lol, i thot it was funny cuz alyssa was like "you look really cute" about my outfit, so i told her about my dad wanting me to dress "elegantly".  (geeze...) well when i came home both parents were here and got into the whole dress nicer thing, so i told them alyssa thot my outfit was cute, and they roll their eyes an go well alyssa dresses like you. and i think thats the funniest thing ever bcuz their attitude was like "what does SHE know? her opinion doesnt carry too much weight" umm, except between what THEY think and what she thinks, i'd take her opinion.  i mean no offense to them, but considering shes my age and actually knows what looks good nowadays... AND she does realize that pants pulled up to your waist are not too cute.  but if i ever do need advice on dressing like they did back in the 80's (which wouldn't be too surprising, considering ive been a cat, madonna, and captain jack sparrow in the past year...lol) ill be sure to listen to all of my parents brilliant comments on fashion. till then, ill take the advice of someone who knows more about fashion in '03...

      gosh i hate all this end of summer stress.  i still have 5 books to read, and i know its mostly my own fault for putting it off for so long but thats just such a crapload of stuff for summer.  it totally kills the whole thing were u forget how much skool sux over the summer and you almost kinda wanna go back.  i remember back before summer reading was invented when the last week of summer i was actually somewhat excited to see everyone and all that.  now i just dread losing the little bit of freedom i do have when im not tied down with all this crap.  my goal is to read the awakening and do my essay before i go to forest home, which is by this sunday.  good luck with that.  this bleeping essay for US hist...man.  and its on the last of the mohicans, which by the way was rele long and drawn out and waaaaaay to descriptive.  i mean, NOBODY cares about how a river winds thru trees for one sentence, let alone a whole freakin chapter.  ugh i hate being stressed in summer. i can have such a better skool yr if i just totally relax over vayk.  ughh, i rele dont wanna b stuck at home for the last week of summer, doing all this.  AND i still have a 300 pg book "America at 1750" which is ALL statistics about population and no one really cares.  i dont even know if im gonna read it, maybe i can just get cliffnotes or somtin, cuz i mean wuts the point, im gonna forget it all neway.  erghhh.  summer assignments suck ass

      well everyone is telling me to blog and ive finally got something to write about besides wut i did today... im really pissed off at my parents right now.  they found out my bro was ...doing somtin pretty bad... so they grounded him and took away his car and stuff.  well that was two weeks ago.  along with HIS punishments, i wasn't allowed to go out as much and i had to be home earlier "so you wont get in trouble" well now, he is ungrounded and he is able to use his car again, and his curfew is 11.  mines 10.  which is always a good idea, ykno, making the good student and good little Christian girl be home before the ..bad kid... you know what really makes me mad about it too? besides the whole unfair and unbalanced thing bcuz my parents are SOOOO easy on my brother and SOOOO hard on me... they are so unwilling to be reasonable about it.  last night i actually thot i was getting somewhere because i was talking to my dad and i was like thinking ok im gonna try to talk to him rationally and show him how unfair it is, so i was like telling him its understandable that he doesnt want me in like, mira mesa in the middle of the night, but if we're watching movies at someones house we're pretty unlikely to get into trouble.  so we kinda agreed on 10 if im out somewhere and 11 if im at someones house.  well tonight i was going to eat dinner at alyssas an then go to christinas to watch from hell (planning on being home by 11).  well i let my parents know where im going and my moms like "be home by 10, no later!" and so i look at my dad thinking ok we talked, we compromised, all that good stuff... except now hes like agreeing with my mom, and now im not even allowed to call and ask to stay a little after 10 like before.  well today i was thinking ok i just gotta get to christinas before 8, bcuz the movies 2 hrs long.  wel my bro calls me at 7:50 cuz he needs me to pick him up and take him home and of course being the little retard i am i do it, and so now i get to christinas at like 8:15 so i had to leave like 20 minutes before the movie was over.  woohoo for early curfews.  i guess thats what i get for ...getting good grades...going to church...NOT smoking or drinking... whoo i am one evil kid.  guess im getting wut i deserve eh.  i love how everyones curfew is 11, including most freshmen.  holy crap i am pissed off.  i know it seems lame but its just like, name one more f-ing thing i can do to make my parents trust me bcuz i really dont know.  and they wonder why i dont wanna go to UCSD.  "you could even live at home!"  YAY for me, so i can set the record for the earliest curfew a college student has ever had.  my dads like saying "dont say we dont give you freedom, you were out all day!"  uhhh lets see, i spent all morning looking for a church which i never found, so instead me and alyssa sat in a park and (tried to) read our Bibles, and hung out (definite delinquent behavior). umm, then went to mira mesa for drinks (jamba juice and fruit punch, not DRINKS) and came to my house.  then i went to the gym with chelsea, and came home to shower and get ready.  then i went to dinner at alyssas and to christinas for a movie.  so, i was out all day being Christian and improving my health, then i went to dinner and a movie at people's houses (who by the way live less than 5min away).  wow, i am definitely a wild one. ok, my other thing is college.  my dads top choices (for me) are stanford or UCSD, while mine are Harvard or UCLA.  ok, if i'm going for stanford, i might as well go to harvard since ive wanted to go there forever (its cross country which is a total plus at the moment...).  if im getting into a skool THAT good, i might as well go ivy league.  but my dad thinks im too young and whatever bs (and im pretty sure this is all coming from the whole thing with my bro, only of course i get shitted on bcuz my bro is their precious little angel).  ok so i let that be for the time being and move on to my second choice, UCLA... and my dad says well UCSD is almost as good AND its close to home.  well im sure u all can imagine how big of a party i threw when hearing THAT one... i mean who WUDNT want to have controlling parents not just through high skool, but all thru college too?! man i sure am excited to do all this hard work just so my dad can decide wut college i go to... rele inspiring and all ykno. someone email me this in 20 yrs so i can have a nice little guide on what not to do to your kids

      whoa, fun bbsitting night i had a 3 month old and a 2 yr old, and my dad was all worried about me taking care of a baby.. telling me to carry her as little as possible, etc etc the only problem is the 2 yr old wanted to be outside all the time so we were in the garage and i was sitting with her, and the lil boy wanted to go sit in these chairs by their front door well as soon as i get up to walk over, my parents drive by (its like 2 houses down) and my dad rolls down the window and tells me i need to get inside RIGHT NOW.  and of course that totally gives me authority with the lil kids, having my daddy come up and tell me what to do over something that stupid. well its not over. they drive off but i guess change their minds because they turn around and ive put the baby in her little bassinet thing but the kid wants to go outside so im standing at the front door while he's talking to his friend (so i can still hear the baby) and my parents pull up (this is like 1min later) and my mom gets out and makes sure the babys inside and not in my arms and that i know its dangerous to carry her.  i was like yeah mom but im in the middle of a job.  u dont just come up in the middle of a freaking job and tell me what to do. so now that ive had both mommy AND daddy come and "scold" me, the 2 yr old thinks im just the coolest person and he must obey everything i say, dont ya think?  ever little kid obeys their bbsitter if her parents come yell at her.  my mom was like "dont get mad, ur dads super pissed" an im like cuz i give a shit? didnt say it tho, it came out more like "ok whatever" of course i had to carry the baby, she cried if i just left her there and what kind of babysitter leaves a little 3 month old screaming in her bassinet just on the off chance that a friggin piano will crush her or somtin if she picks her up? well i came home an my parents *apologized* (well that just undoes EVERYTHING of course) and i was like wutever its ok.  but then they tell me they dont want me bbsitting for babies nemore.  WUT THE HELL.  nice f-ing apology.i got rele mad an my dad was like "dont let ur anger cloud ur judgment, blah blah" and im like wtf its not like i have a choice, even tho i kno i can take care of a baby (i mean what the hell did u pay for bbsitting classes then, so i cud learn how to watch tv with a 6 yr old?) i cant, bcuz u wont let me.. so i rele dont know y they care if i disagree. all i know is they need to learn to trust me and they need to know im rele not as retarded as they think. heres an idea, maybe they shud focus more on the kid thats living here but ignoring every rule bcuz "he's 18" and they legally cant do anything about it anymore.  on that subject, i was just thinking the other day about how all my life ive tried to be a good sister and not annoy my brother.  i wudnt follow him and his friends around (i sometimes talk to them or watch movies with them if they come over here but thats about it) n i try to be rele nice and lend him money and help him with anything he asks me for and all that good stuff.  but u know what, all that's led to is him knowing he can take advantage of me for it.  he knows he can make fun of me all he wants bcuz ill always let it go and be nice again, the most ill do is yell at him or not talk to him for a while, but duz he rele care? he laffs if i yell and is probly happier when im not talking. even when he got his car taken away an it was both of ours i wud for the most part give him first dibs on it and try to compromise and act as if it was still his. even when he was "doing bad things" i covered up for him to try to...i dunno wut exactly i was trying to do but im sure it was something.  "earn his trust" or something stupid. well in return, he's made fun of me, been an ass to me, taken advantage of my always trying to help him, never helped me significantly, made me mad, made me cry, etc etc... i am so f-ing sick of it, i rele dont care anymore. i dont care if i annoy him or if he gets in trouble bcuz i dont cover something up or if he duznt have money or a ride somewhere...and now that ive cheered up everyone reading this, im gonna go. night all

      well, to add to my fantastic night, my hair is basically straight again, except it has just enough curl left to be grossly poofy wavyish.  the only way it stays curly is if i get it wet and then wait until its dried a little but still wet enuf and put just enuf mousse in (too little duznt hold, too much weighs it down) then adding gel and hairspray where it tends to not hold the curl in well and yeah, so basically i have like 1 day a week where it looks alright and the rest of the time its a wavyish mess. fantastic, im glad my parents blew their money on that. the one good thing right now is...ive got a plan :)

      gosh sometimes i hate my brother so much i go so out of my way to be nice to him and stuff, but he just does not give a shit today i guess my mom called him and asked him to park the car in the garage bcuz she was coming back and needed to b able to park (bcuz he had parked it in the driveway so they cud play garage soccer) and he didnt do it so when she came home my dad was rele pissed at him.  well he decides to b a jerk and i hear him in his room talking to his friend and he's totally trashing ME, i cud only hear little bits but id hear "i dont know why SHE cant do, the only time i get to drive the car is when im doing something for them" well 1st U friggin moved the car why wud i move it back? and 2nd if u hadnt gotten in trouble u cud drive ur car whenever u wanted and do anything u wanted pretty much for not doing anything. then i hear "one time she started crying when..." ok bj, bcuz its all my fault, lets be pissed at me and make me look bad. and like i just kept hearing little parts of sentences but it was all about trashing me down, i think i even heard him say somtin like "shes fat anyway, she needs to get off her ass and do something" and grrr, im just rele pissed and i guess sad bcuz its not like i did anything to him, its not even like he asked me to do it for him and i said no, and its not like i dont do a ton of things for him just to be nice.. examples: lending him $20 when he already owes me $25, letting him drive home twice even tho im not sposed to, letting him take the car to go see a friend,  waiting like 10min in the parking lot to make sure he didnt need a ride home, giving him the clicky key thing before i went to class bcuz i knew he needed his soccer stuff (even tho shudnt it have been him looking for me to get it?), and this is all since last friday. i mean i know its nothing that great but its definitely not worth him being that mean. gosh it seems like all of a sudden the skool year isnt going too well, bcuz before it was a lot of hw but a lot of things seemed to b going my way...now it seems like its just a lot of hw and nothings rele going my way. well...gilmore girls is on...night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeen* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      i definitely just told my brother off and now i dunno where he is ok, he calls me into his room to ask if i think hes been acting like a jerk and i said well ya like not necessarily walking around cussing everyone out but he duznt listen to anyone, is never home, and honestly, as lame as it sounds, i usually just dont feel like i have a brother nemore, not in a sad ive lost him movie kinda way but just that hes never around and basically i only see him when we go to skool in the morning and sometimes if he comes home with me, and this is the first time we've talked in a long time, so i mean yeah i know i have a brother but he duznt affect me in any way for the most part (even tho i didnt tell him that last part) and i guess he an my dad had some dumb fight where my dad got suuuuper pissed over somtin rele little but i told him well its probly not about the fight, its about how hard hes worked for u and how ur so ungrateful and dont give a crap about anything or anyone.  and i just told him how he had EVERYTHING, freedom, money, a car, and anything he asked for, an the one thing was that my parents had to have some idea of where he was. well then he got everything taken away but he agreed with me that if he were my dad he wudv done the same thing. still, he duznt think that means he shud b nice to my dad bcuz after all he did get everything taken away. wutever, well after arguing i pretty much told him off about being selfish, not caring about anything, being spoiled, having screwed himself over and how he shudnt blame neone else for that, and that i know he didnt stop (being vague on purpose). ok well after all this he agreed with me at least partly and said he wud go apologize to my dad...and i went to shower.  i went downstairs afterwards and no one was there, so i figured they were upstairs even tho i thot only my mom was there.  well my dad walks in with his jacket on (i heard the front door open too) and i was like where r u coming in from? an he said "from the street" and left it at that. o geeze, well i guess hes in his room cuz my mom just went in to c y the door was closed (i figured it was my dads trick so me an my mom wudnt kno he was gone) and hes there but sounds like things didnt go over very well ok i just realized this sounds like i thot my dad had killed him or somtin, i just kinda pictured my dad getting rele mad an throwing him out of the house, an my bro saying well where am i gonna go w/out a car? an him being like fine ill take u where do u wanna go? and yeah... i was feeling rele bad bcuz i thot the last thing i probly said to him before he left was somtin about how friggin spoiled he is... God i rele hate this, and if my bro tried to apologize an my dads just being a jerk, then whos side am i rele on?  im not gonna help my bro ne by helping him get away with things but if i give him advice and try to help just to have him shot down for making an effort, shudnt i be on his side? can i be on both sides? i cant rele stay neutral, thats what started all this to begin with. why the hell are there sides here? ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeen* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      gosh today has been really boring.  i woke up, finished bio notes, then kate came over and we did math.  then i watched tv for a long time, and then i got bored and decided i wanted to do something.  kate was at ambers party, so i called alyssa bcuz we were planning on booing tonite.  well it turns out she had forgotten she already had plans, so i came online and talked to meggie.  dylan was on his way over so i called allison and talked to chels online.  chelsea explained why shes been so antisocial lately but i still feel just like, rejected.  i dunno its just weird bcuz we were really close up until like a week ago and now i just feel rele unwanted. allison had a lot of homework so she cudny go.  i finally called chrissy but she had homework too.  first before i go into anything else, the order i talked to ppl isnt at all preference, it was more like ok i had plans with alyssa, she cant go lets go online and see whos on, and then i figured allison wud b more likely to be available than chrissy.  ok moving on from that, its just so no one feels unloved or anything.  it just got me thinking, i really need more friends.  like i have friends at skool but friends as in the ones i hang out with, bcuz im sure this isnt the first time this is gonna happen and i just got into that kinda mood where u dont feel like doing anything but youre hoping someone will call so you have somtin to do, so i went and returned this movie and drove around for a couple min, then went home an watched what a girl wants on PPV..   and, i dont know but i just felt all deserted i dunno.  im sure it being "that time of the month" helps and i know everyone cudnt bcuz they had stuff to do, im not like blaming them for my being a loner tonite but i just decided i need more friends.  i even looked thru my cell address book to see if i cud find anyone to call and im sure i cud have called one of them but i wasnt in the mood to be outgoing and call someone i havent seen in a long time.  i was but i wasnt, if that makes sense.  so sunday was a total waste of a weekend and tomorrow im gonna b kicking myself knowing i shudv taken advantage of it to get ahead on HW as long as i wasnt doing anything.  and now i have a headache.  funnn. night all, hw time ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      ok well today nothing huge and dramatic happened for me to vent about... but its halloween and it was pretty fun so i figured i shud write at least a little.. well to begin with it was a calm and boring day but turned out to be rele hectic.  i woke up (thx alyssa, calling me at 9:40-crack of dawn hehe) had breakfast, then went online for a bit and did my bio hw.  then i looked thru my yrbook, showered an watched tv. then kate came over an we left for scary movie  3.  after that we were gonna go to sav ons cuz i was sposed to get candy for trick or treaters.  well she had to get somewhere so she just took me home an i drove myself to sav ons rele fast cuz i was sposed to hang out with alyssa for a bit.  well sav ons didnt have a lot so i got hte best stuff i cud for the best price an went home.  it wasnt enuf tho so i went to wal mart looking for mroe and got a lot more.  well by the time i got home and set out the candy it was 5.  ppl were sposed to come to my house at 6 for trick or treating.  well i went to alyssas for about a half hour and raced home to change an do my makeup.  wel i went full out pirate johnny depp (mustache an beard an all) and then we went trick or treating.  i kno it duznt sound so hectic but it was cuz i was like ok i was sposed to b at alyssas at 4 but it ended up being 5, then i had only a half hour to get into costume so i had to finish while everyone was here...it turned out to b a lot of fun tho, so yeah. i got a crapload of candy too. lol  well im gonna go play some addicting game brandons sending me...bye all, night ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      ok so today, we took megs out to dinner at island's and then went back to her place for a little... ok, i have my dad's cell (mine isnt working) and im checking it every 5min well they call me just as im parking in the driveway and i say im right here.  so i go inside and theyre like omg we were so worried where were you? and they were SO suspicious of me and i was like well islands took forever and then we went to meggies for a little and they were like u shud have called to tell us where u were we were worried blah blah and i was like well if u were worried why didnt you call me? i mean i totally didnt mean it in a rude way or anything but, honestly, duznt that make sense? i mean its really not that difficult, and how much sense does it make for me to be like hmm, i've been gone for two whole hours, parents must be worried! ill call and check in. i mean seriously.  so my mom got mad an was like thats NOT the point you need to tell us where you are and my dad was like yeah we just need to know where you are.  then my mom came into my room later an was like r u ok? you seem so down lately, and youre talking back so much.  um, ok, since when is "why didnt you call me?" talking back? i swear theyre frigign lucky im so nice to them, half the time i wanna rip my hair out they frustrate me so much.  i started to explain that i wasnt talking back but i stopped an just said i'm not even gonna bother. lol yea out loud.  but ok, anything that disagrees with them is considered talking back. so whats the point? and even if i nod and say yeah you're right the wrong way, it's considered talking back bcuz they think im being sarcastic.  and yeah, i got home at 9:30. so its not like im coming home at midnight half drunk, not having answered my cell all night... not even close to that. 1 1/2 more years of being treated like a 5 yr old delinquent...i swear, what do i have to do to be trusted? i know i write about this at least like every week but someone really needs to tell me, bcuz if this is all based on age then somethings wrong here. i cant at all help being 16 but i can definitely help the things i do and if the things i do arent enough for my parents then what the hell is. i mean duz it make sense that when im 18 (if im still living at home) theyll trust me more even if ive gotten caught drinking or somtin than they do now when the last horrible illegal thing i did was sneak into an R movie?  "i think UCSD would be a good college for you to consider"... except its within 30 miles of my house... yeah, sorry but no way am i gonna be the only college frosh with a 10 curfew... gpsh and i thot THAT was bad, but now my parents are freaking out even when i come home a half hour early ok well i cud go on venting for a while but im sure i bored anyone who bothers reading this already so im gonna go... night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      i'm wondering right now what is wrong with me.  i feel so weird like here i am sitting in my nice little room and people out there are at places like qualcomm and high schools and i mean God bless everyone who is helping out there but its so impersonal and its such a last resort and like its insane that i know people there.  at the same time tho, theres ppl crying, homeless, with nowhere to go and im doing what? my homework? blogging? i havent cried all day, well i did a little when i talked to meggie and she said her house had burned down (the first time..before it actually did) but i just feel so...like nothing, like emotionless that ive gotta wonder what it takes to get to me.  i mean my town is burning down around me and im calmly typing this out.  and its weird bcuz my biggest worry is how my hair smells ashy, or how halloween is most likely ruined, and how our plans to go to the football game dressed alike are probly dead too. i was talking to kate about how maybe that bcuz its too much to deal with the big stuff so we focus on the little meaningless things instead.  i guess that makes sense. or maybe its bcuz im thinking about the extent of damage caused by this stupid fire.  like its not just a house lost, its everything inside it and all the memories in it and then it makes the ppl who lived there sad so it makes the ppl they know sad so then for at least a while things are really messed up and like im wondering when we're gonna b able to laugh again like we used to, like when you get really hyper and run around and throw things at each other and crash into things, and just laugh like nothing funnier has ever happened.  it was so weird, last night i was being a little weirdo an i didnt sleep till like 3:40 so i was watching tv and i saw the thing scrolling across the bottom saying ramona was being evacuated for a brush fire but i didnt think much of it cuz ramona isnt exactly my neighbor and "brush" makes it sound like its small for some reason.  wel this morning i woke up and there were super dark rain clouds in the sky and insane winds and my first thot was hurricane (lol) but then i was like yes its finally gonna rain.  too bad my "rain clouds" were actually smoke.  yeah, so plans of going to UCLA kinda died... well i think im kinda done here but im praying for all of u, and if you need ANYTHING call me anytime and if you need a place to stay im here for you, i love u guys  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      wow, i just had the best talk with my parents, now i understand everything, and we all hugged and now we're just one big happy family.  or something.  their idea of a discussion is pretend they listen to me talk, then ignore the points i make that im right on and go off on their explanation and all that bs.  so they come in an r like so y r u mad an i was like ok and i told them that my bros not even paying for the car yet but he still gets priority and its like nothing i can do is enuf to get trust and to gain stuff...like its insane but im like extreme good girl and my bro is extreme bad boy, and i doubt they know how extremely opposite we are on that, but its insane bcuz its like it duznt matter if u deserve somtin or not, they just decide what u get by age.  and gender too, since they think that not having a penis makes me an invalid.  and my dad said that he thot i was being selfish and ungrateful because i was lucky to even have a car to drive, but im like thats bs bcuz thats totally not what im saying... if all we cud afford were rollerblades, then im fine with that. but i dont get why my brother gets a car and a later curfew and precedence over anything he wants just because hes older. i mean i have NO control over my age obviously so why am i being punished for it? an theyre like, you may ahve a car when ur 17 too, but if youre going away to college then you might not. oo ok so what is that? incentive to live at home? screw that, id rather crawl everywhere. and theyre the ones who want me to go to stanford, how is that encouraging me at all to even bother? its like being punished for working hard. i know i write about this a lot, but i dont think ive ever been this pissed over it, i guess im only now realizing that theres nothing i can do about it besides count down the year, 6 months and 22 days until i turn 18. you kno whats weird? when i was little my mom wud talk to me about how kids move out as soon as they turn 18 and what a bad decision that is, and u know how when ur little your parents are the smartest ppl ever an stuff, so i wud actually think wow that so dumb. now i understand though, why would you wanna keep living like this? then again im sure my case is a little more extreme than most...like i understand y my bro hasnt left, he gets everying and all he has to do is have a part time job to pay for part of his car and for spending money...  and i know my other option is to go all out and rebel and show them how bad i CUD be, but thats rele not me and i think it would be stupid to ignore all my morals and everything for them.  also, it pissed me off that my dad kept saying "i know ur mature and ull understand this" and i was like BBBBSSSS. i mean that just proves he thinks im stupid.  it was so obviously his way of making me be like "o wow they think im mature, i should live up to their expectations" sorry guys but im rele not stupid.  gosh i hate sounding like the worlds biggest brat, so i hope im getting my point across. im just so incredibly frustrated at the fact that the only thing that wud make a difference would be growing a penis, and obviously thats not happening anytime soon.  well im starving cuz i never had dinner so im gonna finish up here.... night all........ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well let me start off by saying that for the most part today sucked.  this morning i woke my bro up at 6 and asked him to pleeeease for once get me to school by 7 so i could join in with all the sr vs jr stuff.  we got there at 7:15-thanks a buttload brud.  so basically as i walked into the quad they were all running into the parking lot where the sr's were and i got pulled along by alyssa, then we went to class.  wooo f-ing hoooo. i missed parking cars in a circle to keep the seniors our, putting up signs, tearing down signs, rallying in the quad, and all this other stuff.  so yea my day got off to a bad start. well math was alright, after math was marketing and then we went to the rally, it was pretty funny.  it ran late and we were already having a late lunch so i was like starving, and i go to get the keys from my brother an hes like o yeah i ate your lunch, you can have mine. and i was like ok well my lunch is diff than urs bcuz i dont LIKE yours so i said i dont want ur lunch an he was like fine an walked off...i mean way too feel bad at least.  so then i went and bought lunch cuz what else was i gonna do, and then history was pretty boring but wutever.  after school i was just so pissed at my brother, i mean ok i know it seems rele stupid but its just that i can never do anything because of him and he either doesnt realize it or doesnt give a damn but yeah, its not this one time its all the time, and now i missed this when everyone was like omg it was SOO fun and stuff.  so on the drive home i just sat there and stared out the window, and on top of it all i was getting a headache.  so my only thought was at least my moms not home today because she was home all week because she was sick but she was sposed to go back to work today, and ok im cool with my mom usually but she ALWAYS makes some comment about my appearance, like makeup, clothes, just something.  like yesterday i walked in an she was like whoa, are you tired? an i was like mmm no.. an she was like were u taking a nap? and i was like well great to know i look like i just woke up mom thanks for the encouragement.  as as little as it seems, after getting it every day and especially today when i was already about to shoot the next person who looked at me, i was not in the mood.  so i was relieved when she wasnt anywhere i cud see so i went upstairs and laid down. well i was half asleep until i hear her screaming my name.  i was like whoa she must need me...so i go down and shes like why did u go upstairs? did u wanna change so i wudnt c wut u were wearing? and i was like i didnt see you so i went up. an shes like but my cars there! an i was like but u werent. so shes like well u shudv said hi.  so yes, ppl who read my blog, she woke me up, called me downstairs, and got mad, all because i didnt say HI. i dunno about you but that put me in an even worse mood, so i was like ok an i was gonna go but she was like whats wrong? are you mad at your brother? an i didnt wanna go into it bcuz yeah, so i said no mom im just sleepy.  an shes like did somtin happen? no mom im just sleepy.  whats wrong? mom im just sleepy.  ok this like x5.  then "why are you in such a bad mood?" "BCUZ I WANT TO SLEEP" (i didnt yell it)  ok so then..."whats on your eyes? why do you have that on?" (red glitter) "its CLASS COLOR day mom" an i turn to leave...and ooo here it comes "you need to iron those pants before you wear them, the cuffs are messed up, have you noticed?" and wow, i was just so not into dealing with it at the moment, so i muttered yes and went upstairs.  well ok so then i went to the football game, nothing too exciting but i was having fun and not thinking about it.  well i check my cell an i have 2 missed calls from home..so im like wtf wuts the big deal. i call back...and BRUDDER needs his car.  bcuz he cant drive the camry, or the montero, nooo he must have his corrolla.  even tho hes not paying for it yet so its not rele his.  so the rest of the night i kinda stared off into space and thot about how unfair it all is...gosh i hate sounding so self pitying but its just like (like ive said before a million times) i dont know WHAT more i can do, i do everything i can to be a good kid but no matter wut he always comes first.  so i say screw it.  well we decided to leave cuz we were pretty bored, and we ended up having a lot more fun.  that was definitely way more exciting than the football game...muahahaha.  ok well gtg, parents wanna talk....funnnn bye all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well tomorrow is the homecoming rally... then at night is the game, and saturday is the dance.  im excited it's definitely going to be fun.. we went to alyssas to make our shirts today.. wow, i should never be allowed near puffy paint again.  i had sooo many problems with it, but it turned out alright.  it says "juniors" on the front and the back says Ponce 05 like a jersey... lol.  kate (when she saw me getting mad at the puffy paint) "well, at least now people will know you made it..."  haha, thanks for the support kate.  and then we realized we had no way of putting our last names on the back because the front was still wet, so we ended up putting each others shirts on (me an alyssa, everyone else was gone) and bending over holding on to a chair so we cud write our names.  wow, did that look wrong at times...hahaha.  and it was definitely amusing getting "stuck" in the shirts trying not to smear anything as we took em off...and alyssas shirt gluing to my back. wow, that was just one mess after another.  guys, how bout next time we pay the $12 for a school-designed shirt??? :-D

      ok, well a little over a week later i decided to explain my bad mood last weekend... well, friday i waited for my bro afterskool for like forever cuz he hadnt said i needed a ride home.  so finally i call his cell for like the millionth time n leave a msg saying i went home n whenever he needs the car let me know an ill take it wherever.  so later on he calls an i go get him cuz i guess he had soccer and he like goes insane n cusses me out and TAKES AWAY MY KEY and im like f u ur not even paying for the friggin car, who gives u the right to take it away? (i got it back later) and, ok it sounds rele gay retelling it but i swear thats the maddest ive ever been, just cuz its his fault i had to take the car to begin with, and then he didnt have his cell fone but i mean why the hell is he making my dad pay for it if no one can ever reach him bcuz duh the point of a cell is to avoid things like this and so im put in this position by him, but i still get yelled at for it.  and anyway, who the hell is he to yell at me or take my key away? and the weekend didnt get any better... after the game i got in a fight with my parents about cleaning the litter bcuz my mom was like its ur turn n i was like yeah it is bcuz its always my turn an she was like blah blah i dont like ur tone so i said this is y i dont wanna go to knotts berry farm with you (they had been trying to get me to go) and shes like thats fine (pretending she dzunt care)  2 secs later...you cant use the cars all weekend.  and im like umm, for telling u that i dont wanna spend a whole day fighting with u? an shes like for giving me attitude...so im like fine wutever.  then later she comes in my room an asks if somtin bad happened (whenever they piss me off, they decide im in a bad mood bcuz somtin else happened bcuz noooo it cant be them) and im like no nothing happened so she gives me a hug an is like i love u blah blah an im just like ok wutever but i didnt think i was rele grounded bcuz my mom says a lot of things when shes mad and its usually dumb like that. well the next day i played ice bitch all morning bcuz thats about the only thing i can do without giving them "attitude" lol an they went to the mall and i was telling kate o i kno theyll bring me back somtin cuz thats wut they do when they piss me off an i was saying theyll probly buy me a bag...well they get back and sur[rise i got a bag n some makeup. so even tho i was still pissed its hard to be an ice bitch when someone gives u somtin so i was like ok wutever ill let it go.  well later on im on the fone with kate an were about to go to meggies an i mention it to my mom on her way out..an she looks surprised an is like "how r u gonna get there?" and i was like "um...drive?" an shes like "u cant, remember?" and i just looked at her openmouthed like are you being serious, bcuz honestly like it takes smoking pot for my bro to get grounded for reals, and this is wut it takes for me, wttffff.  so kate drove me, but then she had to leave at 10 cuz thats my curfew. gotta love my parents, making me leave before everyone else AND making someone else drive me.  and kate aka eduardo thank u sooooo much i swear ill be ur chauffer starting dec 23 and ill be ur driver juan and take u everywhere.  well so i had to do my little ice bitch thing all weekend (and trust me, i RULE at that) until they finally decided being grounded one day was enuf (i was still mad bcuz i wasnt sposed to b grounded at all) but wutever, so i finally got the car at night but it was a skool night so i cudnt b out that late neway.  well monday, math was alright boring as usual but wutever.  marketing i had my interview cuz i wanted to be VP and i thot i did rele well but i didnt get the job bcuz the other girl going for it had worked in it before...i guess it was ok tho cuz i talked to the rest of the ppl interviewing and i usually dont and they were all rele nice but still, i rele wanted to be a VP sooo bad.  and that day brennan transfered out of my marketing class too and he like makes me laugh all period so that day definitely killed marketing as my fun class.  then, lunch and history were ok i guess nothing bad or good... but yeah basically friday-monday sucked, like i know its nothing big but its like all weekend i didnt even wanna look at my family bcuz i was so mad, and then marketing, and wut sux about that is that its ongoing and i have to be there all year.  well, tuesday and wednesday were ok and the 4 day weekend was a lot of fun, im so glad we had it.  i had a lot of time to relax and i got a lot of hw done so im not stressing right now.  well thats about all...haha i love how i go on and on about the bad parts and just barely mention the good parts, but i guess this weekend was fun but nothing huge and amazing and great happened so yeah.  well night all... ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      i wonder wut it takes to make it to 16 and never have had a bf, never have been kissed...never so much as like..i dunno holding hands i dont think for some reason around the holidays i especially want a boyfriend or at least a potential one i know i dont NEED a guy, like im definitely a happy person and i love my group and all that..its just i always figure oh eventually i'll meet someone but it's like, ok I'm a junior in high school and of course i figure by the time I graduate ill have had at least one boyfriend but hey, I always thought I would have had a boyfriend by now what's gonna make senior year any different? i gotta admit this is bugging me...new years is coming up and no one to kiss at midnight... (especially not the person i would want to the most) i dont really know where im going with this, i mean writing about this isnt going to change anything. well then again neither is writing about my parents and how mad they make me or writing about my brother and how spoiled he is and all those little unfairities of life. but still, this is probly the only one i have some control over...except i dont really know how to control it i guess.  do you ever just feel like life is going on all around u and ur kinda stuck in the cycle of it struggling to stay in? its sort of like that for me right now, so hectic with school and i feel like no matter how hard i work i have very little impact on my grades...and with vacation, no matter how hard i try to make it last its zooming by...and my family, my brother...i just dont even know with him anymore and it seems like my parents will always be a lot harder on me than him just because im cool like that and theres nothing i can do about it... i guess thats about all for now... later ppls nighty night ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well i just drove my mom home from work cuz i had her car so i wudnt b rideless all day... we got into this talk about college an shes like im so sad y do u wanna go away to college? an we got into how incredibly little freedom i have (which she considers a lot of freedom..) and its that type of convo where i say one thing and she somehow hears something totally different (aka she duznt understand or hears 2 words i say and thinks she knows wut im takling about) so her responses had nothing to do with wut i was saying and ughhh finally i was just like ok forget it, im not even gonna try cuz we're not getting anywhere. i mean, we were into like...how later on "more freedom" for me is gonna b moving in with a boyfriend and im like ok at that age i wudnt ask ur approval but either way i wudnt have sex till marriage so thats not the issue at all! ergh. so yes it was a very productive ride home...*yay ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      ok, now im not allowed to sleep over at allisons while her family is out of town... because we're "two underage girls" which is extremely gay... what does age/sex have to do with it? well obviously age ya if i were 5 but i think most 16yr olds are capable of spending a night without adults. geeze. an then theyre like well u cant on a skool night but thats bullshit too bcuz they were like just have her over here.  (way to be understanding about the fact that she wud rather be at home after being gone for like 2wks) the worst part-as usual-is of course my brother was allowed to before, and hes given my parents a reason to not trust him. the worst thing ive done is like...come home 15min after my VERY early and gay curfew. and yay, skool started again today after a niiiice 2 week break.  math was extremely boring, no idea how im gonna survive the rest of the yr an not fail. marketing sucked cuz we had to do busywork instead of company stuff, an history was OK but i was falling asleep by then. well....bedtime after my long fantastic day *yay* ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Sometimes you wonder why new things come A wind sweeping over a sleepy village Bringing with it the unwanted And tearing away those familiar things we cling so tightly to Fully awake now, and unhappy We survey the damage; what is gone, what is new And with the wind in the distance carrying off what we desire so much A silent thief at sunrise We resign ourselves to make the best of things Never knowing when a breeze will stir things up Or when a tornado will turn our worlds upside down And in the meantime, growing fond of the new things in life  Poem that I'm submitting to the magazine Scripps is doing...feel free to leave comments please and be honest, if you think it's really gay or if there's something I should change let me know.  And leave an idea for a title thats not corny... i need a title sometime before tomorrow :) thx! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      wow, feeling extremely betrayed at the moment. im not gonna go into it, and dont ask me about it cuz i rele dont wanna talk about it. im just soooo pissed off. U dont have the right to talk about or give UR opinion on my life or what i do with it. who the hell made U all knowing queen of the world anyway. im sorry if UR stressed, bitter, tired, overworked, etc etc. we all are dear (except for bitter). dont take it out on me when its UR own fault. im so incredibly sick of this. my life wud b so much easier if i were a guy-less drama and more trust from parents. why cant we be like guys? girls are so friggin petty, and im not excluding myself. i hate myself for caring but it makes me SO MAD. erghhh. oh and yes, we might not have a lacrosse team this year. between those two and dealing with my family (college stuff, me being treated like a 10 yr old stuff, my bro being a jerk...) im having a BAD time. its weird how all the big stuff like that is going on but i get by with a smile on my face with little things. sunday was fun, church in the morning and then alyssas for a movie, then HW (not so fun) and then today well skool was boring except for marketing and now im just waiting to go to the premier of Win A Date With Tad Hamilton (for free! hehe) tomorrow night with Kate-o (even tho she hasnt gone to see LOTR with me yet, grrr hehe) and everyone else, its nothing personal that im taking her and not you, mostly its shes gonna c LOTR with me so im gonna see Tad Hamilton with her, if it werent for that i wud have had no idea who to take. (well i might have eliminated ONE person who wud have been to busy talking sh!t about me to go or even care) but ya, no one take offense or nethin. ok well im done here... bye all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life?  Like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math?  And you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why.  Then you realize how amazing existing is.  And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic.  Ever had that happen?  I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules.  Who would ever come up with that idea?  Anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment.  Oh sure, it's illegal for coldhearted criminals but no one thinks twice when innocent students are subjected to it.  Thank you, America. That's the end of the list though.  The list of things I hate anyway.  Other than that, I'm pretty easygoing. I can feel my head starting to throb.  I blame block schedules.  And possibly my cold.  I hate being sick, and walking around looking like Rudolph, and sniffling every two and a half seconds.  OK, I guess the list wasn't quite over, but who doesn't hate colds?  I think block schedules help spread colds.  Thirty-five kids locked up in a stuffy, overhead room for hours on end?  I bet germs love block schedules.  They get to eat student for two hours.  Maybe we're like germ caviar, like a delicacy.  Then again caviar is really disgusting look.  Oh well, who knows, germs are weird. I don't think I'll ever understand parents.  Even if I ever become one.  Why do they ask their kids to "see things from our point of view" but then they can't be bothered to take one peek from the kid's perspective.  The book we read in French, Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince), talks about how exasperating adults are because everything needs to be explained to them.  At the time it was funny but I've realized how true it is.  In fact, parents probably invented block schedules.  If I ever become an adult, I hope I'm not like that.  I'm not too worried though, I'm not really planning on becoming one. I really think its a conscious choice.  Like a day comes and you decide its time to take responsibility for things and to be an adult.  Now I have no problem taking responsibility, but being an adult entails so much more.  So when that day comes, I"ll just go and do something childish, like pudding someone's car.  (Pudding-ing cars is something my friends and I invented.)  That'll keep me from getting sucked into this adult thing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well thats it.  im sick and tired of fighting over college with parents, so im giving up. UCSD here i come. yaaaaay. i just wish they had told me since i was starting high school so I didnt waste all that extra time doing HW. i mean back then i was still thinking east coast. but hey those dreams were crushed and now im left living my dads dream for me: stanford.  of course i like the older, classic college look so i give up on east coast and go for UCLA-but no, i cant live my dreams 2 hours away from home any more than i can 5 hours (on a plane) away. but u know what, i dont care anymore. im over it. i want my car that ive been waiting two years, and im sick of these battles where my parents rele think im incredibly stupid just bcuz theyve kept me locked up in here and that the second i have an ounce of freedom im gonna go insane and do everything i can.  well first of all, thats NOT part of the plan at all and second of all if i rele wanted to do somtin i wud find a way to, no matter where im living and whether or not i have a car.  so u kno wut, im sick of staying up the latest and waking up the earliest in the family, struggling to get good grades, striving to graduate in white, and all this while trying to maintain a normal social life and not drive myself crazy with all the crap ive yet to do, in addition to recently working my ass off with trying to save the lax team and finals.  so i decided i give up. happy mom and dad? its awesome having my dreams taken from east coast, possibly ivy league, to UCSD. right now i really dont care. UCSD, SDSU...mesa..its all the same. in fact im incredibly tempted to just drop all my APs and coast for the rest of the year. except i still believe that somehow God has something for me and right now im relying on him to help me out, because my parents sure arent doing that great of a job at it. until then, i want my car and im done trying to show my parents im not gonna go wild the moment i get freedom.  who knows, maybe ill meet those expectations just for the hell of it. but probly not. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      crime: going out to dinner with bro one night PAST CURFEW (GASP) reasons: felt kinda bad for how much trouble he was in, starving, no food in house punishment: grounded till next sunday (the entire 5 day weekend *yay*), cant drive to or from school for the next week (rides with parents *yay*), dont get a car (ive only been waiting for it for 2 years, no biggie) the up side: if im good, ill be allowed to use my brothers car eventually (luuucky me) why it sucks ass: its the one bad thing ive done in at least a year and im getting totally screwed over for it, in addition to having the entire soccer team hate me, missing out on the 5 day weekend and getting driven to skool by MY MOM (i can walk down to class with the froshies, no prob)  i hate life so much right now.  and it seems so trivial when everyones still mourning my uncle but i hate this so much. ive worked my ass off for so long and the main things that kept me going are the thoughts of going to a good college and getting a car.  well my parents destroyed both.  the one positive thing that can come from this is that i prayed for God to give me a way to be able to go away to college if it was something i shud do, an since i had to pick between a car or going away i guess..prayer answered. unless my parents decide that this one mistake, in addition to showing how incredibly irresponsible i am at the moment, shows that ill never be responsible and force me to stay home. hmmm, in that case i think ill go neway, ill be 18 and i can get a job and pay for my own college even tho ill have like a million in loans to pay back.  wutever, its worth it. leaving in: 1 year 7 months and 23 days ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well, after last night i think its pretty safe to say at least half the senior class is gonna hate me soon. but thats ok, i cud get over that.  except tonite i was stupid enough to go out past "curfew" (7 while my parents are gone) an the only reason why is cuz i was starving and i went to dinner with my bro partly cuz i felt bad for how much trouble i got him in.  wel the thing is my uncle wanted to come an check in on us an talk an stuff and he ended up not leaving till 8, which is ok cuz we had a good talk n stuff.  the bad thing is i was still starving and theres not really food in the house.  we were gonna get fast food but ended up going to fuddruckers (the curfew thing kinda faded in my mind) an next thing i kno my parents are calling my cell and flipping out cuz we went out late.  i mean, ok im truly sorry i did it and i wish i had thought it through but its insane, my dads threatening to take away my not yet existent car and im like... they are SO much harder on me than me bro.  i mean it takes this for them to flip out, be extremely "hurt", and be like "dont start too" and its just... its not that big a deal, i mean its not as incredibly huge as ur making it out to be. it sux bcuz last time we talked its like theyre all like saying how much they miss me and stuff and it takes this to make them do a total 180 and jsut like hate me. thats just faaaantastic... and i can forget about broomball, hopefully my parents will be lenient about my huge bbsitting job this weekend tho cuz it goes late. ughh.  all i can do now is pray my parents will realize its not as major as theyve made it out to be. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

        You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly  ANGELIC . Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Chapter1 Once upon a time Chelsea owned a chappy named "I plead the fifth".  She called him fifthy for short.  One day she forgot fifthy at her awesome fantastic friend Arleen's house.  Arleen was going to return fifthy the next day, after lacrosse practice, but forgot because she had to run some errands.  By now fifthy was very sad because he missed Chelsea so much!  Arleen and Chelsea didn't see each other all day, so poor Fifthy had to stay at Arleen's house for another night.  The next day, tragedy hit: Chelsea left for the river.  Fifty was stunned, and had no idea when his beloved owner would be back.  He packed up his things, thanked Arleen for her hospitality, and left.  He was going to find Chelsea. Chapter2 After almost a week of hitching rides with snails, Fifthy was at the river.  He made a beeline for Chelsea's river house, and was stuneed to find it empty.  Brokenhearted, he began to weep in heartwrenching sobs.  He wondered if he would ever see Chelsea again.  All of a sudden, he felt a tap on his shoulder.  He turned, and looking at him was a kangaroo. "Hello", she said.  "My name is Poneloosa.  I was wondering why you're crying, maybe I can help." "My Chelsea!" Bawled Fifthy.  "She's gone!  I don't know if I'll ever find her!" "Well," Said Poneloosa. "I saw a Chelsea leaving a few days ago.  I think she said she was going home to San Diego.  I'm on my way there, so why don't you ride with me?" Chapter 3 Chappy peeked out from Poneloosa's pouch.  They were in front of Chelsea's house.  He climbed out, thanked Poneloosa, and turned excitedly towards the house.  He saw Chelsea's car and smiled.  He was so excited to see her.  As Poneloosa spread her wings and flew into the sunset, Fifthy hopped towards the house.  Just as he was about to ring the doorbell, Chelsea opened the door and scooped him into her arms. "Oh my Fifthy, I've missed you so!" She cried as she smoothed down the folds of her dress.  "I love you Chelsea!" Cried Fifthy.  And so they walked hand in hand into the house, overjoyed to be together again. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      wow, so yeah, i definitely love lax but it has its downsides.  like how i strain the same muscle on my left leg every time we run sprints.  but how pathetic and strangely coincidential wud it be to tell my coaches i cant run sprints? so yeah.  and definitely being tired 24/7 blows.  its like...i cant concentrate during practice but i kill myself trying, and then im too sleepy to do hw.  like wednesday night, when i took a homework break by laying on my carpet "for a few min" and woke up a half hour later on the fone with chels.  now im not sure how exactly i answered the fone and managed to have a convo without being awake but..i did.  and then yesterday night i just totally refused to do homework.  i seriously did NO homework.  it was great.  the downside is...now i have a ton more catching up to do.  but its ok...im taking it slowly.  well today we had practice and i actually played like someone who deserved to make the team, unlike the past couple days.  man wed an thurs practices, i sucked SO much....like i was seriously wondering wut ever made me think i cud play lax and how on earth i made the team bcuz i dont think i stick checked neone in those two days, i dropped most passes an made bad throws, i cudnt cradle and just...aghh! so today definitely made me happy.  we got our goggles too, which arent too bad. everyone hates em and cant see that well with them but they help me, maybe cuz of my contacts but before if i ran, wind got in my eyes and my contacts got fuzzy so now thats not a problem, and i dont rele get like twisty magnified vision or nethin scrimmage tomorrow at RB, whoo im way excited. cept im the only returner on JV cuz roz is at a volleyball tourney, and bri and janelle got pulled up to play on varsity.  so we got me at point, i think giolzetti at cover point..im not sure whos third man.  we got megs at first home.  thats all i know.  we better have a good center.  but its ok, ill enjoy getting shut down...lol.  well, rb is insanely good to begin with.  haha ashely (our coach) was saying we're known as the "rough girls" so RB is gonna b bitchy to us, an thats not good considering theyre mean to begin with.  lol, when ashely was explaining rules an going over shooting space (rule that u cant be in front of someone who is shooting) me an bri acted out WHY the rule is in place (aka me almost getting a black eye cuz i went to stick check her as she went to shoot...hehe) we had mad fun at practice.  then i ran home, jumped in the shower, went to islands (w/ megs, chels, natasha, matt, danny, ken, katie, heather, linda, missy...i dunno im probly forgetting some ppl, sorry guys, big grp!), then went to alyssas bcuz she is sick and she slept on me while i read a magazine and then i left a little before nine cuz i was falling asleep and it wud b bad if i totally passed out and missed curfew... so homies, heres the rundown.  my back hurts. my eye is a little bruised, not too noticeably. there is a bruise on my arm. there are at least five big bruises on my shins and a couple scratches.  the back of my shoulder has somtin quirky goin on cuz when i lay down it feels like im laying on a pen or somtin. im so tired that even tho im a little insomniac im sleepy before 10. my hw is piling up.  i have a lax game tomorrow thats going to be impossible.  but ykno wut? i love it.  i wudnt trade it for anything.  lacrosse just is able to make me really happy or really sad, and when i feel like im playing well it makes me happy.  so lets hope playing-well streak lasts till tomorrow for my scrimmage.  i heart u guys! nighty night ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      hey hey all! whoo i had a good day!  in the morning i talked to Chris a bit cuz i parked next to him, then tyson came over and sat in the car with me while everyone showed up.  linda and natasha parked next to me an we all jus chilled.  when matt got there him an tyson did rele cool dances to my rap cd, it was cool to watch.  matt kidnapped juanpepe (my cars mascot) for the day but its ok cuz he took good care of him and gave him back :-P all day i was getting more and more nervous to find out if i made lax, by the end of psych 4th per i was sitting completely straight clenching my textbook so tight my knuckles were white, as i watched the last couple min go by and thought about how the next 5min wud determine how good the end of the year wud be (as dramatic as it sounds...so true) then bri grabbed me an we went over to the list.  i did a quick once over and almost fainted cuz i didnt see my name, but then i saw it and screamed madly.  right below it was meagan powers and i jumped up and down as i kept screaming madly.  i felt bad for bri cuz she was put on jv when she shud b on varsity, and a couple ppl wud probly b better on jv for now... but, well we'll see, hopefully she gets pulled up.  course having her on my team is always good.  after skool i cudnt go to practice cuz i had an eye dr appt an my mom was like U CANT MISS IT so i went an then slept on the way home cuz i was so hungry i had no energy...i kno it sounds dramatic but i was seriously drained.  so yea, considering i napped most of 2nd per, zoned out most of 4th, an did a semifun lab all 6th, plus having an amusing morning and an AWESOME lunch...whoooo smiles everywhere. the funniest thing was when i was walking back from checking hte list trying not to have too huge a smile on my face cuz i walked back alone an i wud look sooo strange strolling along with a huge grin.  well meg shows up and i leap on her an yell "MEGGIE! WE MAAADE IT!" she was SO shocked, her jaw drops an shes like "EVEN ME?" (haha, hence "we") an im like "YES!" an we spend the next 5min screaming and hugging, calming down an then screaming and hugging again.  so ppls watch out, lax thug on a rampage, just wait till u see how prettily my legs will be scratched and bruised...i dont care, battle scars homie! i heart everyone!!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      hey hey guys, guess its march now.  i havent blogged in a week so here i go.  all last week we had lax tryouts, they are SO fun! today was our last day of tryouts and teams are posted tomorrow...so keep your fingers crossed for me.  friday a whole big group of us went to islands and to see "50 First Dates"...its SO funny and cute, and she has a lax stick in the movie! me n megs high fived when she whipped it out-lol.  saturday we went to the mall, it was fun.  we stopped by mickey d's on the way there cuz i needed a massive dose of caffeine (42oz soda=96 cents hehe) and these little boys (middle skoolers) came in and hit on us! it was sooo amusing.  we took a pic, check out meg's picture trail thingie to see it...the little guy decided to throw his arm around me in it (i let him for the pic but then i had to like shove him off me...) sunday i went to get my hair trimmed, then off to the gym, and back home. showered, went to dinner with megs n rachell, an then my parents called to see if i wanted to go see the passion of the Christ with em so i did and it was SOOOO good, its the only movie thats every made me cry.  it was so graphic and kinda scary (with demons and stuff) but i thot it was well done, like the demon/satan parts were like...i dunno its hard to explain, just not overdone like a horror movie or somtin i guess my parents thot it was overexaggerated and it was kinda (the whippings...he was sposed to be whipped 39 times but they did like...i dunno, i lost count...way over 39 tho) but other than that i thot mel gibson did an awesome job, im totally gonna watch it again.  after the movie i came home an did hw till 1, went to sleep an was up by 5:30.  we had our last lax tryouts today...i drove elisa an janelle home, we had the best time. first we went to mcd's to the drive thru an like our order got totally screwy cuz they both wanted big macs with diff stuff an they were like telling me an i was telling brandon (tantoco) and he was so confused finally i was like ok can we start over? an they like DIED laughing (elisa an janelle) and so we finally got the order straight and we pull up to the window, an i guess everyone with a headset can hear the drive thru ppl (aka everyone who works there) so they were all gathered around the window to see who we were...it was soooo great.  then we were driving back from skool where i dropped off elisa an theres that part going up the hill where if u stop at the red ur car goes back before going forward cuz its kinda a steep hill, an it took my car longer than i expected to start going fwd so i did the weirdest like screech cuz it wudnt go...we died laughing at that one too.  then i came home, watched tv, did hw, showered an now i smell good.  i am SO nervous for lax...i wanna make it SOOO bad. it is seriously going to make or break my rest of the year....so here goes nothing, im trusting that wutever happens God is behind it an he knows wuts best for me.................. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

"And they all say 'I just sat on it and it went up my ass!'"  "bud eye-b sid yoo wer a podee tay!"

      well we just got back from our lax game and we kicked bonita vista's ass but im still in a horrible mood...so here i go from the beginning tuesday period 4 i go to see if i have any change..but i cant find my wallet.  well i figure,  hmm, i must have left it at home. at lunch i go out to my car to get my food and walk back to where everyone is.  chrissy n chels walk towards me n ask if ive lost my wallet.  i say maybe, i thot i just left it at home.  well it turns out joe deignan let them know, cuz he cudnt find me, that he had seen my wallet in a toilet in the boys bathroom.  lovely.  so i go to the office, talk to rodriguez, get a janitor to get it out.  turns out the wonderful loser who took it also decided to make it untouchable by peeing and crapping on it.  they put it in a bag until my parents decided wut they wanted to do with it bcuz it was a "biohazard" (exactly wut ive always wanted to hear my wallet called) so, to sum up, i lost: $20, my license, all of my high school ID cards, ALL of my wallet pix (dating back to middle school), my insurance card, library and blockbuster cards... yeah its gonna be fun straightening that out.  ok then this morning me n megs were playing lax in the parking lot and i go and hit her on the head, i mean wtf was that. then i cudnt find my goggles all day and i almost went insane cuz... well theyre like $50 goggles n geeze wuts wrong with me i lose friggin everything.  after skool i had to go home and get money and my cleats, cept i forgot my cleats an had to turn around and go back n get em.  well then we went to in'n'out got food, went to jamba got hinah her smoothie.  then we left for bonita vista and since i had the yahoo directions that are all detailed i led n megs followed...well long story short i got us all lost cuz the yahoo directions were f'd up so we got directions and megs led this time and got us there but we were late by then so ashely said there wud b consequences bcuz we didnt call (cept megs called a bunch of times an left messages but wutever...) and we left our teammates pretty much screwed so they had to play w/ 7 ppl vs 12.  i mean we still totally killed but thats not the point.  i do feel bad for leaving them like that, but its not like we did in on purpose.  well now everyone who was late has "consequences" tomorrow and i know theyre all saying its not my fault but its like...i got the bad directions, i was driving, i was leading, and they cudnt do much besides sit there and help me look for wut the bad directions said to. some ppl on the team bitching at me when its none of their business (actually more like one person but hey) didnt help much either. ooo and yes i found out some news today that i rele dont care to publish but that pisses me off like hell.  goody, i wonder what wonderful surprises tomorrow shall bring ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well yest the scrimmage went RELE well...we lost, but that was no surprise..lol.  i played most of the game cept the first 5min of each half and then i felt i played pretty well. i was able to clear the ball (aka throw it rele far down the field away from our goal) a couple times and i actually ran with teh ball a bit too, as opposed to just smacking the people who have it. :)  Rob, last yrs coach, was reffing and he kept calling me for "dangerous stick checks" but i was like...dude, ur the one who taught me! lol.  but its ok he wud just make fun of me and tell me to stop looking like i was gonna chop someones head off.  then him n the other ref were saying i looked like a helicopter (my stick swinging around up the air) but thats ok cuz i got some good stick checks in and then i get a rep for being vicious so the girls are scared to go by me :-P.  i think its funny how i never get rele hurt during the games, like ill have bruises later on but nothing that rele hurts...yet i injure so many ppl.  maybe its offense that mostly gets hurt? i dunno.  wutever..the game put me in a great mood cuz even tho we lost, our team did pretty well. i mean first game ever, most of the ppl on the field on our team have never seen a lax field before and here we are playing a decent game! our team looks like its gonna b pretty good this year.  Thursday @ Bonita Vista, 3:30 Vars and 5:00 JV...be there! ull see me at skool in my sexay skirt! :-P ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well, today school was pretty boring and all that... i was hyper in history for some reason, like VERY hyper...i was just acting stupid and cracking up over nothing.  then after skool we chilled for a bit and i hung out with kate n allison while the girls i was sposed to drive to the game went to get stuff from their gym lockers.  then tyson asked me to drive him home and ryan asked if i cud take him too, so matt came along with us and i took them into the future.  i kinda forgot about our plan tho, sorry me-gay im working on it!!!! (no more detail bcuz its a SECRET!) then i brought matt back to school cuz his car was there n i had to pick up the lax chicks and then we went to my house to get some stuff, an then we left for fallbrook. man, that skool is seriously in the middle of nowhere. 1hr 10min drive there, 40min drive back (rush hour traffic, considering it was 3:30 when we drove there and 10 when we came back) we got there at 4:40 so then we asked some guys there where we cud get food an we were directed to a jack in the box. yummmminay we were all ready to eat our own arms off dude. so it was good we got food considering we had a lax game to play-lol.  i called megs to see if she wanted me to bring her somtin but they had already gone there, so we met up at the field.  i did bio and then taped my ankles and changed my shoes (during the vars game) and then it was our turn to play yaaay.  man this fog had slowly rolled in, so by the time we played it was dark and SO foggy, plus our TINTED goggles kept fogging up. it was sooo bad, everything further than like 3ft away was fuzzy.  the only way i cud tell when the ball was coming down was by watching the girls i was defending, like when they ran and put their sticks up and id watch wut direction they were headed n stuff, but man it was hard cuz i never knew for sure who had the ball.  this one time, a girl dropped the ball as she went to shoot so i picked it up an she like...ran at me just as i cleared it, but she still slammed into me and knocked me over...as well as trampling my foot...and no ref called it! i was like ok lets call me on stick checks bcz they "look dangerous" but not call the girl who knocks me over. cool cool. well wutever.  so in the end we won a VERY close game, 6-5 so it was a good night.  my back hurts...i have a couple new bruises, pretty small tho. and im sleepy. so nighty night ppls! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      I think math class is good at making me think creatively.  Kind of an oxymoron, considering it's boring as all hell.  Yet for some reason math is when I most feel like writing or doing something creative.  Maybe it's like my brain's final attempt to entertain itself before it shuts down completely or like, implodes.  So what you are currently reading is the reason I can still function despite hours of math drilled into my skull like nails.  Well, this and my water.  There's just something about water.  Like that old commercial with Lisa Kudrow where she talks about how water is the "perfect nothing".  So weird but so true.  I could use a DC right now though-I need my caffeine to get me through the day! Lacrosse is an awesome outlet for my anger.  Not that I have a lot of it-most of my friends would tell you I'm not much of an angry child.  But still, everyone needs to let loose sometimes.  Sadly, the result of this is... a lot of bruises, mostly on me.  Can't say I mind all that much though, they're "battle scars". ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      mmm so what has happened since i last blogged.  well lets see, that was a week and a day ago.  sheesh it seems like so much longer than that.  ok well lacrosse-wise, nothing too major happened on thurs or fri.  saturday we had a touney and we ended up 1:2:2 (wins:ties:losses) and we got cool shirts, awesome tan lines and had a lot of fun.  cept me an megs were discussing a few things which got on our nerves, but a public blog is not the place to get into it because drama i do not like!  i got back from the tourney and went to see "secret window" with kateo.  sunday morning i went to church w/ alyssa, this church in el cajon that was sposed to be good but we both got bored.  cept this one guy in the choir was like "bopping out" as we called it, cuz everyones singing all serious an there he is like dancing around and mostly...well bopping.  then i ran a couple errands, did HW, and left for the gulls game.  man we had some fun at the in'n'out drive thru on the way home! haha. car surfing, wut? haha. monday and tues were normal days, wednesday we played La Jolla and tied!!!!! that was awesome bcuz they are supposed to be SO good. o and also i knocked this girl over (more like she decided to leap into my foot, sliiiick) and as she tumbled down she rammed into my knee and i only played part of the second half cuz i cudnt run after that, ergh! and then no practice today cuz i went to the doctor even tho its getting better, an x-rays showed everything was ok so the doctor said she thinks its a large internal bruise.  first home game vs serra tomorrow! yay! :-P i hope i can play! ive been icing the hell out of my knee. ok, off the topic of lax, there is this frosh child who looks like a 10 yr old who humps my car and duz everything possible to annoy me...i think he thinks were friends? even when i go after him with my lax stick, tell him to go away, yell at him, insult him, etc...he will not get the message to go away!  he asks y i hate him...and i dont hate him..it is a very strong word.  i dislike him and if he bothers me again i will beat him down with my lax stick.  i dont like being mean to ppl but when they go out of their way to annoy me then i will do so. i think im too much talk no action, ive threatened him enuf times but ive never rele hurt him (well i threw him off my hood and reversed into him and ran into him when he wudnt get out of the way, but it wasnt enuf to injuer him).  i dunno, im scared to break him or somtin. child, understand that i am nice to everyone except ppl who annoy me ceaselessly even when i ask em to stop. so STOP, or i will be mean..er.  ok well it is bedtime for me ppls so ttyl! nighty night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well ive been told to update by several people and im also feeling somewhat creative at the moment so here i go writing last game was against coronado and we beat em! exciting stuff considering they were undefeated before us..muahaha! ooo and i got my pink lacrosse stick, its sooo adorable.  i didnt get the shaft i wanted but thats ok ill live, it was friggin $40 (not including the head)! i was like it wont mkae that big a diff... wut i liked was that the back of it was kinda U shaped while the front had like 4 diff sides, so u cud tell which way the stick was facing without looking at it, which helps cuz it sucks so much when u go to scoop or catch an its facing the wrong way.  and its the thickest and heaviest stick available for women so i cud hit a hell of a lot harder...but i mean, the best stick in the world wont do much if the player isnt any good..so im over it, im super happy with my stick :-P i was gonna write a poem or somtin cuz i felt inspired..but i think my muse is gone now..off to bed like i shud be soon anyway no one wants to hear me ramble this week looks like its me n allison cuz kateo is in jersey, chels and chrissy are college hopping, and megs is off to hawaii. im goin to 6 flags on wednesday but thats all im doing.  i hope it gets sunny...i wanna do spring-y stuff like swim and tan.

      gosh i gotta say...i cannot stand being bossed around by girls who are younger than me.  being bossed around in general bothers me, but if the person is older than me and has some authority over me, i can deal.  girls-i get to a place when i get there, i dont go home and take a nap and then decide to leave 5min before i needa be there.  some of us have stuff we need to do before games, and yeah i have a license but that also means i have to do things for my parents and cant devote my life mind body and soul to lacrosse-even though i do devote a good portion of those.  gosh, i was just pissed yest cuz like...i kept getting yelled at for getting "shooting space" calls but i wasnt IN bleeping shooting space after the first time.  sorry the ref hates me, i wont ever do it again.  i love lax so ill deal with all the crap that comes with it, all im saying is some people needa learn their place (hint: it isnt in my face, riding my ass, or any other place that involves bossing me around) ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      well today we had lacrosse pix at wind'n'sea and it was fun, i took a buddy pic with megs n rachel g. and its cute!! however, lisa an rachel marino were whining cuz i never mention them in here ;) so i promised them an entry. man those girls crack me up-and theyre friggin full of sh!t! the thing is that one of them tells some little lie, an i think mmm im not sure i believe her.  then the other one agrees and joins in an makes the whole thing so convincing! i am starting to realize that after years of being twins, those two probly have a few tricks worked out that they pull.  but ooo i am catching on chicas!!! haha, lisa amuses me like no other by how openly she says everything and asks stuff...like asking megs wut she did w/ her ex and whether she likes having her ass grabbed! lol ive noticed rachel gets shotty a lot more often than lisa.  im not sure y.  care to explain ladies? well, now they have been fighting for it more cuz sometimes ill let em steer for me, but then they fight over whos a better driver.  too bad they both suck. haha jk! we are gonna kick Uni ass tomorrow, and it will be SO awesome!  sweaters r coming in next week and just...yay..lax rocks my socks in case u didnt know it! and i love my new pink stick im still working on breaking it in but its awesome! nighty night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      so yeah. im depgry.  lacrosse games used to make me so happy but now they suck.  offense-STOP FRIGGIN YELLING AT DEFENSE.  I want so badly to just shout shut up but i think its retarded how our team falls apart the second we start losing.  if nothing else, try to ACT like were united on the field guys.  anyway, who was offense to yell at me today when they barely managed one f-ing goal? last game im not stick-checking enough and this game im checking too much.  guess wut.  im over it.  ive played longer than most of u and i know what im doing and hey sometimes i dont get the ball, but hey sometimes u dont get the goal.  thats how it works, deal.  wutever happened to playing lax cuz its fun? i miss my team from last year.  well, theres a few ppl i wud want to have on the team from this year, but just last year we had fun and yea sometimes we lost hey thats how it goes.  im just so sick of friggin underclassmen yelling at me, ESPECIALLY when theyre doing worse! and ok, i can take constructive criticism.  but there is a difference between "defense try to spread out some more guys" (which is something we cant really see too well) and "defense step it up!" (sorry if my defensive skills arent to ur liking, but in case u didnt know were all a part of the team and care just as much about winning so were doing our best) or "hey watch your shooting space ok?" (im already kicking myself for it, the ref has kindly pointed it out to me as well, so i think ive got it covered k? sorry if when me and a girl are sprinting at each other and im trying to figure out how im gonna knock the ball out of her net im not also calculating the angle at which i am between her and the goal, esp considering if i look back to see shell run past me). basically, it comes down to this: im doing the best i can out there, and sometimes i make decisions which go bad and sometimes i make decisions which go good.  same as everyone else.  if you have CONSTRUCTIVE criticism to offer, please feel free to do so.  however, please stop and think before you say sometihng and make sure it is not something i already know because then its just you yelling at me, pissing me off, and just not accomplishing anything positive overall.  its like me being like "try to make that ball go in the goal next time k?" or "hey next time try not to let the defense get the ball". i am SOOO sick of this, its such bullshit, but i love lacrosse wholeheartedly so im just gonna have to deal now arent i. well a wonderful night to everyone, please i beg u, enjoy it because i sure as hell am not. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      soooo. the game today. was bad.  we lost to serra by ONE again.  actually we tied, but their scorekeepers suck. oh well, im over it.  i think we shudv just given it a rest after kyra said there was nothing we could do because.. otherwise we look pathetic, begging for points, and its just lame. oh well.  gosh i played SO terrible today, like im used to being in the entire game even when im not doing all that well so i know if i get taken out its BAD. and yeah. i got taken out.  i did a lot better after i went back in though, cept too bad that was late in the second half already.  its weird how some games our defense comes together so awesomely and other times it falls apart.  not pointing any fingers-im definitely part of the problem.  its not rele anyone doing something wrong... its more like when we all run down the field with the person who has the ball, leaving like 5 ppl open.  thats the worst cuz..who backs off? and if u say i got it go mark people, an then u dont get it, everyones like ugh i shudv stayed on them i wudv gotten it, and no one wants to assume that responsibility so no one says it.  at least thats wut i think is going on.  its weird like when i get rele into the game i move more instinctually, and everything goes so much better.  when i think too much i know im not gonna do too well cuz i overthink everything.  ok well im done boring u all with that. after the game i drove leeva and megs drove hannah, becky, lisa and rachel and we went to B&BW and then Oscar's, it was so fun!  i got a piggy back ("pony back") ride from megs n when we ran in, a bunch of kids started laughing and cheering..haha.  it was great.  then leeva talked to random ppl in line and told them blonde jokes, lol.  we went home an leeva went with me to barnes n noble to get a review book for AP U.S. and then to Vons cuz we needed bread.  then i took her home and came home, watched the OC..which is getting pathetically soap-operaish but is still good! then i showered and now im bloggin n now its bedtime! night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      gotta love how i dont write in here for like..10 days and now i write twice in one day.  im just not sleepy but not awake enough to do homework.  so instead im gonna ramble in here and write one of those weird entries thats gonna make chrissy shake her head at me.  mostly ive been thinking, is there rele a point to life? i mean yeah the point right now is to get good grades, have some fun and get through high school so i can go to a good college so i can get a good job so i can retire etc etc. its like a neverending chain.  its kinda weird too how wut i do today can impact what i do 50 years from now (aka vacation in florida vs make fries at mcd's) so of course theres the material point to life, which is of course due to the desire to live comfortably and have enough money for everything you want.  then of course another point of life is to have fun because nothings really worth it if u arent having some fun.  so far, the point of life is to have money with which to entertain yourself. basically, anyway.  but honestly, when youre 60 years old looking back are you going to think "YES! i aced my math test back in 11th grade" no youre going to think geeze i locked myself up studying rather than go out and have fun.  which is more important? is either one really all that important or is there something else that makes you look back on everything and be happy you experienced it? the psychologist erikson theorizes that humans go through different stages of development and each one has two possible outcomes, one positive and one negative.  almost like a video game where you have to pass the next level and sometimes u barely make it but you dont have as many lives or gold stars in the next.  well, the last stage in his theory is shame vs integrity.  shame is when u look back on life and realize it was a waste and integrity is when you are able to look back on life proudly and accept everything in it, the good and bad, as an overall experience, and appreciate it.  so what does it take to reach that stage and attain integrity? i always wonder.. if God knows beforehand whether we are going to choose him or not, and therefore whether we will go to heaven or hell...why not skip the whole "life" part of it and just go straight to wherever we're going to end up? i mean obviously God has his reasons because its not like hes going to realize o thats a better idea let it be so and poof its like that but i mean, i cant help but wonder..  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      sheesh.  actually a lot worse wording than that is going thru my head at the moment. ok so it started yesterday, yes i didnt get a lot of sleep at allison's (so my mom thot i was moody cuz of lack of sleep) but that doesnt affect my mood cuz i never get that much sleep to begin with.  i went to church with alyssa and i was fine.  well, i get home an pretty much the first thing my mom notices is that my toenail polish (which is so light i cudnt even see it) is chipped, an that i shudnt wear sandals if my nails are chipped.  ok wutever.  second thing she notices is that my pants are see thru...well theyre white but if its all the same white u cant rele tell how see thru it is.  then she proceeds to tell me to vacuum about 5 times within a 10min period.  i say ok i will each time, but im rele trying to get my part of the history project to chrissy cuz i know she wants to finish it up early and get to bed early cuz she has AP Eng in the morning.  well for some reason my parents dont realize that the next two weeks will pretty much determine whether this year has been a complete waste or not (even tho with being forced to go to UCSD its pretty much a waste already).  so my mom DEMANDS that i do my frickin chores right then, at that instant, and in addition since me n my bro cant remember whos week it is to clean the cat crap, she decides that it is my week.  PERFECT TIMING!  so i get up in a pissy mood bcuz somehow my bros screwing around is more important than me doing hw, an my mom gets MAD cuz IM mad! erghhh. so by then im pissed off and i finish my chores and close my door and do hw.  ok, to most ppl closed door WOULD equal leave me alone im busy and would greatly prefer not being disturbed.  well, they were gonna go get my bros gorgeous new car and invite me along.  (of course im DYING to go, considering im the one who shud b getting a new car) i say no, i have hw.  my mom asks again.  i say no, i have hw.  she opens the door, walks in an goes cmon lets go get the car! so i say rele coldly NO, i have HW.. an she gives me this sad look an says oo ok.. and im like ok thx for the guilt trip but ur the one who made me mad and now ur pretending everythings just great.  well they go an get the car *yay* and my parents have explained various times that him having the cute new car n me having the crashed reject (yes i kno its cute but its pathetic that ive got my bros old corolla w/ a screwed up bumper and a taped door handle, AND a velcro'd compartment, when hes got the fixed up new mustang) isnt a reward for him bcuz he has to pay for it all himself etc etc and its hard to drive stick blah blah and im like... wutever, it boils down to hes got the cute new car and i have to settle for wut he left behind, when i thot id b getting the cute new car esp considering ive worked my ass off this year an hes basically smoked/drank it away.  so as u can tell my day wasnt going too well and i was in a bad mood towards my mom the rest of the day.  she asked me wut was wrong and i said well i was fine till i came home an u got on my case, an shes like well if the prob is when u come home, maybe u shudnt go out at all and then u wont have that issue! HAAAA HAAA HAAA im very amused at this point (or somtin). well my dad tells me how childish im being an telling me im not a child nemore an to act older but its like...ur treating me like a kid by saying that, cuz kids react to that cuz they wanna look older, and my mom is treating me like a kid by bossing me around, so if i am treated like a kid i shall act as such.  well today i walk in an say hi to my mom trying hard to pretend im over it.  first thing she asks "r u in a better mood now?" ERGHHH.  i roll my eyes and say sure to avoid starting nethin, but its so stupid cuz whenever she pisses me off she assumes theres some other reason for me being mad cuz she cudnt have POSSIBLY done that, nooooo.  well i get over it n come here to chat an she comes and asks if somethings happened lately cuz ive been in such a bad mood blah blah.  so i tell her to accept that she made me mad its not nethin else an she keeps asking all these random scenarios that cudv made me change my attitude (r u doing drugs? did a guy do something offensive? ARRGHHHH!!!) and im like...no?? an shes like i KNOW you, what happened? an im like well obviously u dont cuz nothing did... so shes talking about how ive been attitudey with her lately and im like well ur so rude to me how am i supposed to respond? an shes like ooo ok im rude, how am i rude? n i give her a couple examples.. an shes like well im ur mom and if u keep giving me attitude ur gonna get privileges taken away like curfew (uhh..10:00 is a PRIVILEGE?) and ull have to do ur own laundry, i love u n ur brother both the same and i also punish u the same.  so im thinking...ok, he has to do his own laundry after being caught smoking and drinking various times, but she pisses me off an im already being threatened with it? yeah thats loving and punishing us both the same for sure.  but hey maybe ill get a new mustang then right? haaa haaa im fuuuunny.  and then after all this her threatening me crap shes like u need to spend time with me cuz im ur best and only true friend blah blah blah and im like...riiiiight.  all my best and truest friends yell at me, demand things THIS INSTANT, dont listen to me, and treat me unfairly.  duuhhhh thats wut a friend is!!! so yes, i am so set on moving away at the moment...ergh! my moms also saying that she needs to b stricter or else im gonna get worse and im like.. nooo, if ur stricter ill get worse cuz im only rude when ur rude and shes like blah blah blah of course again not listening.  thanks besterest and truestest friend! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      So, yes, it is, as Chrissy put on the bag with my delicious choc chip cookies "quince de mayo, dos mil y quatro" (aka May 15, 2004) I love my ladies and guys that wished me a happy birthday and made my bday awesome as usual!  I woke up, read, Kate-o called from journalism and then Alyssa screamed HAPPY BIRTHDAY from across the room and I was like awww... an then Kate came over and we chilled an then went to Allisons to swim but we just talked.  Then we went to Oscars to get me breadsticks and as were in line kate comes in an shows me her surprise...SWITCHFOOT TICKETS!!!!! YAY!  JUNE 9 CONCERT WUT WUT!!! but Chrissy showed up with a bag full of Choc chip cookies so i just got a water cup an kateo got some breadstix.  Then we went to see Troy and i was excited cuz I wud get to flash my ID and be like why yes I am 17...but they didnt ask for it! And I went to both sides too...cuz me and Kate had to get the young'un's tickets..hahaha.  But I got a free small soda with my movie card so I was excited!  Troy was SOOOO good! And then I went home and we went to Black Angus for dinner and my family wanted to go see Troy but I was like...its good but not enuf to watch twice in a row, considering its almost 3 hrs long.  And dude I peed 3 times during the movie, dunno y!  I didn't even drink all that much.  Hahaha I know u wanted to know that.  Anyway I came home after dinner and went to Alyssa's for a bit and we talked a lot but I had to be home by 10 so we cudnt talk too much and she had snickerdoodles for me (I swear they wanna see me gain 20 pounds) they are sooo yummy! And then I came home and talked to ppl and Chels an Megs came home from Linda's partay and we talked and now I was about to go to bed but I was like...I needa blog on my BDAY.  And ooo, my parents woke me up this morning to give me my present...this super PIMP watch but i think I'm gonna exchange it for one thats not as fancy looking cuz i like it but like... in the summer when Im in shorts and a t-shirt or somtin it's gonna look weird.  So that was my birthday... and oooo, go JUNIORS!!! We won Powderpuff yesterday! The cheerleaders were awesome...juniors AND seniors!  Night all! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      yeah, so the school week is over and there are 20 days till summer whooo!   i guess tomorrow im not allowed out past 4 cuz the girls (best chicks ever!) have some surprise planned for me.  check out my first clue:  ***************** Arleen- Kate is with me and she gives u permission to stay at home from 4:00 on-because we have something sneaky planned for you.  Beware!  Be showered by 4:00 and have all make-up applied.  Love, Hippo   P.S. This is Kate-O you owe me bigggg. I'm missing two things for this so you better treat me and my snowy good looks, even though i am white. P.S. This is Chelsea, come discover what is just around the river bend, but beware, I can be savage. P.S. This is Allison, and I was created by drugs.  However, I am running very late and must be leaving. P.S. This is Meggie, and I am your maid for the night.  However, I am very beautiful and you will notice that at midnight. P.S. This is Lauren, and I want to be part of your world, however, please buy me some feet.  Our next date should be at the beach. P.S. This is Christina, and I love books.  I should really be Alyssa, but I am not.  I really think you are ugly, but I'm sure over time over time you will get handsomer.   P.S. This is Alyssa, and I am scared now that I have turned sixteen....please don't kill me!  I live in Europe and have no love life, but I won't worry because I know you're coming for me. *****************  ...notice it says have all makeup applied but says nothing about being dressed.. heh heh heh... lol jk  theyre crazy chicas i swear.  they say i have the best princess but so far it looks like im the prince.  wut dorks. lol.  i bet im minnie mouse or somtin.  well, im going out for the night in a little so thats wuts new, bye all! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      so i havent even been 17 for a week and about the only thing ive managed to accomplish has been starting up going to the gym again now that lax is over and working on rele being in shape next season. other than that ive slept too much, been lazy, slacked in school.. plus no guys and a little too much drama for my taste. right now i have no incentive to wake up tomorrow, get presentable, go to school and endure 6 hrs of that.   looks like its time to get over myself...night all. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      period one...we did nothing besides busywork. stupid math. i napped instead.  marketing we had a sub and a worksheet to do but we went walking instead and chilled with kelseys bf jon and tennelle. we had alex mcneil bring us fries when he went to get food. then lunchtime was fun, and per 5 we watched last of the mohicans...and now we gotta do a critique of it. afterskool i read for a little cuz i was tired an then i went to the gym and worked myself.. i guess not all that much but since we started slacking off at practice so much im not in too great of shape.  i havent been at the gym since lax started so it was different but fun.  then i went to the library and looked for these 2 books for an hour, only to find one of the two and then not b able to check it out cuz my library card barcode was smeared...thanks to the jackass who stole my wallet a while back.  well now i gotta sign up for a new one so im like f this cuz they wanna charge me for a new one too.  uhh, sorry my wallet was stolen wont do that again. an then i came home and turns out i cant do nethin for my bday cuz my moms work might go on strike and its just not a good time cuz everythings so up in the air.  and i feel bad cuz i cant rele be like wahh not fair an then get my way cuz i understand why its like this but its just...stuff always seems to happen around my birthday.  i dunno if i wrote this before or not but i remember i was just like...im not even looking fwd to my birthday for once. i think it was around the time after my parents were out of town an all that. then for some reason i was excited the last few days cuz it looked like it might actually be cool (even without a few major things id been looking fwd to since forever...) but...just goes to show i needa stop getting my hopes up cuz then if somtin good happens then yay and if not o well i wasnt expecting it neway. thats not just me tho, i try that but at the last second i get optimistic. wutever, im over myself. i need gas badly.  ill probly stop on my way to skool just in case.  thats about it..night all ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      ok so on saturday, here is wut happened i was ready by 4 so i went to watch TV until 4:30 when i was sposed to be ready.  at 4:30 i got a call from alyssa to make sure i was ready.  i was instructed to: unlock the front door, change into my black dance pants and a white cami, close my blinds, and sit on my bed with my eyes closed.  so i did all that and lay there for a while, until alyssa called again to make sure i had done that.  then i heard them come in, giggling and going SHHH and then giggling again.  they came upstairs and stopped in the hallway, where alyssa called out, "are your eyes closed?" so i said yeah and they came in.  they dressed me in a button up shirt and then allison leaped on my bed to put my hair into a bun.  i was confused but then redid the bun lower as instructed. then a big hat was put on my head.  my mom was videotaping the whole thing.  finally, they drew a moustache on me and i was allowed to open my eyes.  i was dressed like a man!  and all of them were disney princesses, so I was prince charming and had 7 dates for the night.  they were all who I had guessed and alyssa was sleeping beauty, why i didnt figure that out i dont know! so they tell me were going out to see a movie and then dinner.  we go out to the cars and theyre all decorated with streamers and stuff is written on the windows in pink and blue.  alyssas car said "Aurora and Prince Charming" on one window and "Snow White and Ariel" on another (actually Swow White cuz kateo is a dork hahaha) and then the back windows said Royal Chariot and Princesses Inside.  Then the back window said "Honk for the Birthday Girl!"  Chelsea's car was similar, one of her windows said Arleen's 17! And the others said who was inside.  The back window said HONK in big letters.   So off we go to see Shrek 2 which was SO GOOD!  And on the way we had tons of fun driving in random parking lots to get ppl to honk and waving at ppl and catcalling some of them! haha.  the cooler ones were the guys who wud get all pumped up and jump and pump their fists..haha.  then after the movie this guy was with his mom an shes like whos birthday is it? an im like mine! an the guy goes want a present? and points at himself! hahaha. then we went to farrells but the wait was so long we went to dominos next door and ate out of the back of chelseas car.  then we went to farrells for ice cream.  they told our waiter it was my bday so he made a huge scene like they do there.  it was sooo cute and fun.  omg the best moment of the night HAD to be when we decided ok were going to Dominos.  so chelsea, since i guess she had the money, walks in alone with her pocahontas outfit and uggs, an this other lady in there gives her the weirdest stare, an all of a sudden it kinda hits us that o yeah were dressed up so we shud stick together...hahaha.  so we went inside and joined chels.  but it was still hilarious watching her walk in alone an all of a sudden realize how weird she looks-LMAO.  i love u guys :-P this was SOOOO fun!!! cant wait for pix-theyre SO going on my binder! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      its amazing and incredible but yes it is finally summer, junior year is over and this huge weight has been lifted from me.  this year seemed like it would never end, yet at the same time it flew by.  its hard to decide whether it was a long year or a short year but i think were all agreed it wasnt the best year... way too much work in addition to s lot of other poopy stuff.  christina and chels thanks for the comments :-P at least two people love me this summer ive babysat a lot so im pretty well off financially for the time being.  nothing too amazing has happened, well one girl i babysat i shud mention cuz i was so amused/scared.  we were in the garage an i wudnt let her play outside, so she raises her arms at me and starts speaking another language (haha gibberish most likely) in this rele deep voice...i was like uhh lets go inside.  other than that shes adorable though. i dont know what else there is to say about summer...weve gone to the beach a couple of times.. thats fun. thats about all weve done, besides that its been movie nights, getting food, an jus chillin.  well ill write when something more interesting happens... ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      ok so i am being told to update so...here i go. i actually have a story to tell about this weekend...i had a pretty bad headache.  like it started fri and it was rele mild and then saturday i thought it was a migraine except i wasnt rele sensitive to light and sound, but then sunday i woke up at 5 cuz it hurt so bad and every time i moved it hurt and when i walked my entire head would start pounding.  i felt like brain in pinky and the brain, where his heads all big and swollen. when my parents woke up my mom gave me tylenol and i slept till the afternoon.  i woke up n thot i was better and had some subway, but then it slowly started coming back. finally by like 10, after watching hours of TV and movies, my mom got rele worried at how much pain i was in cuz the tylenol wasnt doing nethin to help, so they took me in to the ER.  we waited for like an hour before the doctor cud finally see us, so by then it was like midnight. then he decided to put me on an IV and I HATE NEEDLES IN MY SKIN so that sucked an so they gave me a painkiller IV and a nutrition IV just in case my headache was like vitamin deficiency or somtin.  while that was slowly going into my bloodstream *yay* i got to go get a cat scan.  it was rele scary cuz ive had one before but i didnt remember how much the thing ur on moves, so i thought it might pull me through and yank the IV out of my hand.  it was also freezing in there and i had to sit there in a hospital gown with nothing but a sheet covering me.  then when i was done they took me to this little room outside where the next patient was and i sat there for so long i started thinking they had forgotten about me, an they were gonna close down the hospital and i was just gonna b sitting there, hooked up to a stupid IV and freezing my ass off.  finally they got me an we went back to my little room.  the doctor said my brain looked fine, and by then the IV was done.  it hadnt helped at all so he gave me this migraine medicine. that didnt do anything either, so finally they were like ok...this isnt working, were gonna give u some morphine.  the guy came in and it was a shot but they just did it thru the IV so not as much pain thank God...but omg, my entire arm was like frozen on the inside, and this rele weird sensation went thru my entire body. my stomach also started turning cuz morphine makes u nauseous and it was rele hard to breathe.. my parents were like "are u ok? how do u feel?" an i was like "its just weird" and they were like "weird how?" an i was like "well i know this doesnt make sense but i just feel, like purple" they got a huge kick out of that but i swear...i felt purple! lol.  well after that my headache faded a bit and i got the IV taken out so i could get dressed and leave.  it was 5 when we got home, and i threw up cuz the morphine made me so nauseous.  then i threw up in the morning before i ate anything, and then i had cereal and threw up again. yummm. i didnt eat anything besides broth and crackers and then butter toast much later that night. they had given me vicodin but the headache didnt come back strongly enuf for me to need it, and by that night it was gone.  hooray for me.  the end! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Good afternoon readers and gentlemen. This is your host, Meggie. I'm updating Arleen's blog for her because she isn't "in the mood." So I'm just gonna do it this once!! Woo! Anyhoo Arleen's been really busy lately. Babysitting, throwing up, feeling purple, reading a book called TTYL, and soon she'll be off to lacrosse camp. She hung out with me the other day we went to go see Stepford Wives with Chelsea. Weird movie but I think Arleen liked it. Tomorrow she and I will be going to the gym around 9...depending on when her majesty wakes up. She might be coming to Six Flags with us on Mon/Tues/whenever!! Haha. Well, Arleen is better now she isn't sick and she isnt throwing up. Morphine made her feel like purple was going through her legs. It was a bad purple though, mind you. She is talking about a sleep ovarie aka Spending the Night dealy. Now she's telling me about Switchfoot so I'll cut this short but hey...get ready for entries cause I'm gonna pester her! Yahoo! Signing out, I am Sheldon...I mean...Megan...wait....ah dammit! Goodnight Wakefield. *.(meggie).*

      hmm, so i'm all packed and ready to go.  tomorrow...well today since it is thursday morning now, through sunday I will be in laughlin, california which is basically like going to "the river" only on the cali side of it.  then sunday on the way home I will be dropped off at Forest Home, so I will not come back until the day of Alyssa's 17th party.  woohoo, happy early bday bestest hippo ever! so, its been forever since i wrote in here. well, not too much exciting stuff has happened really.  Allison's friend katelyn from AZ was visiting last week, so i met her.  she is a lot of fun.. the first day i met her we all went to see mean girls on base, but since chrissy had to get us in an there were 6 ppl in a 5 person car, chels rode in the trunk.  it was sooo funny listening to her back there.  mean girls was hilarious, who cud ever NOT love tina fey? she is a genius.  then i went home and didnt do anything cuz i was in a bad mood cuz i missed out on this huge babysitting job in san clemente where i wudv made a ton of money cuz my parents thot it was too far away.  on thursday for allisons bday we made her soffe shorts that said "Birthday Girl" on the butt and made her wear em to the del mar fair.  we had a LOT of fun cuz it was wristband day so we went on a lot of rides and yummm funnel cake.  there were a few ppl frm skool there too, a bunch of seniors who i kinda knew, an then another group of seniors i knew thru my brother, and some underclassmen from lacrosse who said another girl from the team was there also, even tho i never saw her. after the fair we pretty much jus chilled at allisons.  the next day i dont remember wut we did. that was pretty much the more exciting part of the last couple weeks, since then its been pretty routine stuff going on.. we watched the shining last night, only not the real one but the super long super bad made for tv one and it was pretty boring. today i took my car in to get fixed cuz one of the compartment doors had been broken and two door handles were peeling and it turned out they were all under warranty.  so i waited for an hour and a half just sitting there people watching, daydreaming, and half listening to a tv drone on and on about john kerry who by the way i do not like. haha, sorry but hes just two faced and bleh. and i think its funny that him and edwards are both named john.  but that wud b my weird ironic sense of humor.  well, i decided to go look around at all the car stuff they were selling and the guy who was helping me with the car came in and told me there was a part missing and it wud take an hour to go get it so i said ok thats fine and i walked to walmart (about a 15min walk) and bought pringles and a diet pepsi and then walked back.  other than that my life has been all about sleeping, going to the gym and doing major college research and i think the hardest part is narrowing down the colleges im applying to, but i think its fun reading about them and stuff. its weird cuz this trip is going to pretty much set everything in motion, because ill be gone for a week and a half, then ill have a week at home and then im off to camp with alyssa and the week i get back is the lacrosse camp im going to, but at least its not a sleepaway camp so i wont really be gone.  then i have another week off and im off to camp again, and i will be back aug 21.  well, im off to bed, so goodnight and goodbye to everyone...cu all when i get back! i heart u all... ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      OK,&nbsp; so im exhausted and was planning on leaving this till tomorrow but i know i wudnt get around to it so ill try to do this fast. 9:30 chrissy picked me up and we went off to pepperdine.&nbsp; we got there about 20min before our tour started (12:40) and sat around until 1.&nbsp; then we went on the tour which was just a little over an hour, but it was rele good and i got to see the campus which by the way is gorgeous.&nbsp; after the tour i had a meeting with one of the couselors so i did that and i asked her a lot of financial stuff and talked to her about my major (communications) which was also her major so we talked about wut kind of job she went into after she graduated.&nbsp; the meeting was probably about 10 minutes because what i was mostly interested in was finding a way to pay for it and she doesnt really handle financial stuff.&nbsp; so then we went around the campus and filmed some nice places and stuff for my parents to see (with the beach in the background of every shot haha) .&nbsp; so then we finished that up and went to santa monica promenade and shopped for a bit, then went to beverly hills and shopped on rodeo drive (no celebrity sightings tho, boo).&nbsp; then we went to bel air to see nice houses but the&nbsp;street we were on was actually pretty crappy.&nbsp; it was getting kinda late by then so we headed to hollywood for dinner at the hard rock cafe.&nbsp; we were out of there by 8:30 but santa monica blvd (or road or wutever it was) was so packed, it took us forever to get on the freeway.&nbsp; then the freeway was totally backed up and we were going between 0 and 4 miles for a long time.&nbsp; finally it cleared and we even got to go 65 occassionally.&nbsp; then, whooo finally we got on the 5 and not only was there construction but (as i later found out from my dad) there was an oil spill on the 15 so traffic was terrible.&nbsp; finally it cleared, and as we got to where the 5 meets the 805, chrissy went on the 5 but then decided 805 would have been better cuz she cud get off in mira mesa, so we got off on the next exit an turned around but missed the sorrento valley exit, so we went on 56 east (crossing our fingers it was finished) and joined to the 15 and finally got off, whoo!&nbsp; so we ended up getting home at 11:30 (2 and a half hours later that we expected) but it was awesome, and fun, and it was definitely an adventure, and i think the tape shud turn out pretty well.&nbsp; and now..im ready to collapse into bed so g'night! ~~~~~~~~~~~~  *RLeeN*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Wow...its been forever since i blogged.&nbsp; Well, thursday the 9th I left on vacation to Laughlin, Nevada.&nbsp; I said CA before but my mom was distracted when she told me that, cuz later on she said NV.&nbsp; well, it was soooo fun, and i got to jet ski for the first time ever but no tubing :(  then i went to forest home which was a lot of fun and was probably one of the more eventful and drama-filled weeks ive had up there but as always fun.&nbsp; the girls in my cabin were pretty cool, all a little younger than me but still fun girls.&nbsp; sunday was alyssas bday party and it was so fun!&nbsp; we had a scavenger hunt all over scripps and had to take random pix.&nbsp; it was me, alyssa, kate and katie vs. chels, chrissy, lauren and kimmy and we won! woohoo!&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; then we went back and had a gingerbread house-building contest and my team was me an chels.&nbsp; our house was the messiest but the coolest-3 stories high!&nbsp; then we ate some of it but it was waaay too much so we threw the rest away and then we did presents!&nbsp; me an christina had (well, mostly done by chrissy cuz i was gone but i helped plan, and i got her anchorman paraphenilia to make up for the extra work) a huge box in which was a smaller box in which was an smaller box in which was the actual present.&nbsp; the present was a 3 story maze through which she had to bring a small metal ball all the way to teh end in order to be able to read the note inside telling her what her present was.&nbsp; then she had to find a map which told her where various gifts were hidden which were connected to her bigger present.&nbsp; the big surprise was wild rivers so we had bought flip flops (that said "princess training camp" haha), a waterproof camera, candy (for the ride up), a mix cd (also for the ride up), maps (so she wont get lost haha), and a big bird inner tube.&nbsp; then we talked and messed around with candles (flower and stem, right chrissy? lol) and finally watched some SNL and went to sleep.&nbsp; it was sooo fun and i cant wait for wild rivers.&nbsp; tomorrow is roadtrip to pepperdine which should be fun.&nbsp; got snacks, music, magazines, videocam (so my parents can see the place), all ready to go!&nbsp; nighty night all, ill let u kno how the trip goes.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  *RLeeN*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
