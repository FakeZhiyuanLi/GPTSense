      Hello. My name is Krista J. van Eps. But tonight you can call me "Just Krista." HAHA! Some Will & Grace humour for you all!  What is new in the life of me! Well...everything! I'm currently in Pinocchio! And, for like the 3 people, that read this. Please go and see it! Unless your name is Patrick..then you don't even have to buy tickets. Why, aren't you the lucky duck!  Pinocchio is going well. Except for the fact that I'm just a tad bit overwhelmed by it all!    "Can I do this........? Or Have a bitten off more than I can chew?"   All I know is that I must keep on going and try my very,very best.     "This is it kiddies..this is the big time! Am I scared? Terrified. But I think..fingers crossed...I can actually do this!"        I'm happy that the aforementioned Mr. Patrick is in Pino. too! It would be weird and even more scary without my lil TOTT buddy. That's Tales of the Troll for you first comers to KristaLand! "Trolls", as it later became known, was my first really big show. And if actually the reason behind the madness that is the title of this entry. The director Edward J. Williams...or Ed...or Edwardo to me was in the show Hello Dolly at the same theatre I was at some many years before.   Oh, how I miss my darling Edwardo. Actually it's quite sad how much I miss that hyper,lovely, balding,twently-something year old man.  Nevertheless. Life is great! Much better than it was several months ago!   I think my acting career is trying a new direction!!! FORWARD! HAHA! Lol.   Well I best be off. I just thought I'd share a lil bit of my life with all of you! Aren't I nice!  I'll be sure to write soon with more news on the developing cirque(circus) that is my life.   And I'll be sure to pass all the dirrty details regarding the lovely Pinocchio. This is sure gunna be an adventure. But I'm sooo thankful and blessed to get this opportunity. I'm not gunna let any of the memories slip away. Until our next meeting. Much love and props to ya Mother!         WORD!  Love always &amp; forever,  **Krista**  (The TheatreBugg)

      Testing 1...2...3........  My morning has be riddled with computer problems! I had to get up super early to help our dog, Emily. It ws not fun! The very cold morning air at 9 AM! Brrrrr. Not fun. Seriously it's super cold out! Why? It's still summer!  Right?  Anywho, life is good. Except for my stupid computer! Ugh. It is so stupid that I had to delete two blogs.  But don't worry I'll be sure to give it a talking to lata!  Thanks 4 all the help Patrick!  Lol. More news later!

      It's offical. My computer and I are not longer speaking with one another.But I think we are off and running.  It's kinda weird actually. My blogs work..but not really..I believe that they are in all different places in the vast world that is the world wide web.  Whatever. I surrender!  That is that! ~~~~~~  I still don't believe that I'm actually in Pinocchio!! It's just so surreal. In the time of about a month my life flipped upside down..in a good way!  But things are just gettin' started! I start school in 24 days! Call me a geek if you wish, but I'm actually excited to start school! Long has it been my dream to attend an arts school!!!  I best go. The dog needs help...again! Back to the bitter cold I go! Wish me luck.

      Ugh. I feel very ill this afternoon. Must be the heat!   Recently I have been thinking about life post-Pinocchio. What will happen after the long-nosed one is no more? I made the nearly fatal mistake of not thinking about life after Trolls. I was just so caught up in the moment that is being in a show. The outcome was that I was not in a show for an entire year! Which is an eternity. I cannot let that happen again. The time between August 3, 2003 - July 15, 2004 was, well, horrible. I would not wish the worst of those days on anyone.   I'm thinking of doing more Stages Shows after Pinocchio. I will also train. And I have school, of course.  But I need theatre constantly. It's almost like an addiction. And if I have to go through one of those one year periods again......well,I honestly just can't.  I must remember to keep my chin high and wait for the right opportunity to present itself. Until then, on with the show.   Till later, Krista

      Hello friends! LOL! I'm talking to myself..ignore me.  Pino. is going well! We are almost to my scene! It's kinda scary.....but ok. I'm kinda excited. I just hope I do ok.   Ha! I promised myself that I would wrote in every two days about news..e.tc.,etc.,etc. But it's been 5 days since I last wrote. Oops. But what can I say? I've been busy. Pino. is off and running! I can't believe that we are already in the 3 week of rehearsal before I know it I will be on stage..in costume..on opening night! YIKES!  I was praying and hoping for some challedges in my acting career that tested my mind and ability....I got it! Working more with the body than the face is a challedge but it is oh so much fun!!! I like my mask! It's..well.....cute...kinda.  I kinda look like an old man.  I think deep down I'm really stressed about the whole thing.....Pino.....I want to cast in more of their plays.....  Seriously though...not a 20 minute time span goes by when I don't think about "Cchio". Even when I'm with my friends...like I was like all of this weekend..well not now......lol.  But....I think everything will be great! The cast is excellent.  I best go. More news lata! Krista (the Fox..lol)

      That is right visons of Pino. do dance in my head! Why? Becuz it's always on my mind. We are to be offbook...already! That's just creepy? Isn't it amazing how time flies? I mean I'm actually some what busy! I'm never busy!   I love it all though. But it is still a bit on the surreal side.   I'm having fun. For instance, on the way home from rehearsal last Friday. (I ride with Emily and Stpeh...castmates.) We had like sooooo much fun. I like couldn't stop laughing! We listened to "old school" music. What can be defined as "music from a different era or point in time. Usually, a song that is very memoriable or just so weird and "old" that the only way to define is with an out burst of "OMG, this is old school." Old school. O-L-D- S-C-H-O-O-L!!!!  That was a great defination, huh?  Webster is turning in his grave. LOL! That was fun.  I'm so scared but sooo excited.  Today we went school shopping....me and Meem! Meem and I. It was fun. Kinda. I was kinda out of it. I got the shoes that I have always wanted!  Tomorrow, Meem and I will probably go and look for shoes for "Cchio."   All in all life is good. Scary,yet good.  I best go. I must sleep.  Sleeping is good.  Nighty-night.
