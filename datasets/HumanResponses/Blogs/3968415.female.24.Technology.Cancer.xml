      It is another 6-7 hrs before i set off to my first open water dive trip to Tioman.  I am totally excited !!&nbsp;   Then i received an email....  --------------------  Subject: EXXON MOBIL - BLOOD DONATION TODAY FROM 10 AM TO 4 PM  Hello all: The above service is at HarbourFront Atrium from 10 am to 4.00 pm today. Do birng your NRIC (Passport for non-Singaporeans) or Donation Card if you wish to donate blood. Regards, Judy  ---------------------  I used to be a pretty regular blood donor. NUS was just next to NUH blood centre. But since i started work 2 yrs ago, i think i have only donated blood once. Hence, my inital thoughts was "Let's go!!". &nbsp;  My chain of thoughts were if nitrogen narcosis was to happen,&nbsp; by giving blood,&nbsp; it would reduce the amount of nitrogen that can possibly be infused since there&nbsp;would be reduction of the amount of blood in my body,&nbsp;ya?  Nonetheless, i decided to ask the wise one --  urlLink www.google.com &nbsp;:o)   from  urlLink http://divermag.com/archives/april2000/divedoctor_apr00.html   Diving after Blood Donation By Dr. Sawatzky  How does donating blood affect diving?   For the first few hours/days after donating blood, the person will be more susceptible to fainting and will have a reduced exercise capacity. After the blood volume that was lost in the donation is replaced, the person will no longer be prone to fainting and might actually have a slightly improved exercise capacity. There are theoretical slight increases in the risk of oxygen toxicity and DeCompression Sickness but this change in risk most likely has no practical significance. You should never dive (nor do other strenuous activity) the day of a blood donation and should be sure to drink lots of nonalcoholic fluids after donating blood. It should be okay to do conservative dives the next day but if you want to be absolutely certain you have recovered from the acute effects of donating blood,  wait 72 hours.    &nbsp; The CONCLUSION  Think i will give this donation a miss.&nbsp; Afterall, I already have a buddy to look out for.    The last thing i need is to feel faint during my dive and to look out for him at the same time.    *hahahhah*  :o)

      It has been a while.   I took a 5.5 weeks break from work.&nbsp; Came back to a retreat. Another 2 days off. In addition, there were some birthday celebrations in between. That is like a 6-7 weeks break.   It took me a while to get my engine started! After today's meeting, I realise that I am in trouble! And my blood is boilling.   The new project I am thrown into is in ridiculous shape. Everything is in a mess. I suspect the initial testing wasnt done properly, change mangement wasnt in place,&nbsp; the project wasnt managed correctly and the people in the original team were clueless!&nbsp;   Below are my observations,   1. How can a system go to LIVE when it has evident bugs?   --> Someone actually said this, "Nah.. User wun use this one.."  *Scratch head* I mean why the hell provide the function when u know the user wun use it. And since it is provided, this means it is in the URS! Bloody hell!! Then someone must have wanted it and&nbsp;this will be used!  And if it is NOT going to be used,&nbsp;&nbsp;why did u spend time working on it?  And since you have already spent time on it, why&nbsp;did u produce a lousy piece of work?  There is no professionalism in this. This is so half-***ked!   2. How can someone make changes to the source codes without knowing what the hell is going on?  --> When we ask for some documents to explain what the system is all about. The only answers were,  " We made changes to it overnight."  " Existing ones are very outdated."  " We dun know what the actual logic is all about. The person who has made changes to it has left."  " Let's read the source codes."   I mean *duh!* We need the logic!! Do you mean u changed the codes without knowing what&nbsp;the change is?? And there must have been a triggering point to the change ya? No documentation, no email, no flowcharts?? *applause for making it this far*   Read the source codes!?? I mean what we see on the UI is the result of the codes ya? And the fact that we are asking for supporting documents is that the UI is grossly wrong and we need to find out what the hell it is sposed to be, so we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;make the correct change and to provide a solution.   3. How can we build on top of something so shaky?   The foundation is so weak! It is goin to CRUMBLE on us! I suggested to print out the entities in the memory to do the necessary comparison to make sure our foundation is correct first. I mean that should be the first cut to sieve out BUGs!! There needs to be a thorough clean up before we even move towards tracing real time updates and all the other good-to-haves that are built on top of this.&nbsp; Although they agree with me, they decided to move on cos they wanted to identify the bugs and then solve it ad-hoc whenever we encounter it. GREAT eh?   So in conclusion,   We are going to build on top of a system, which nobody knows what the hell it is sposed to do!!   :o) We are goin to be in for a good time.   Cheers

      This is unbelieveable!!  &nbsp;  I mean if u had slogged ur ass off for the last 2 years, happened to be damn unlucky to miss ur first pay increment in the 1st yr cos of wage freeze, and had delivered 2 succesful projects one after the other, you would think your bosses will reward you with a fat pay increment..  &nbsp;  Noooooo.. it has to be a small little token of appreciation , 14%!!  &nbsp;  i mean with such a small base pay.. any tiny amt will add up to 14%. Comeon! Who else you know is an IT professional takes home less than 2K! I am disgusted! And now with a 14% increment, it tips it slightly over 2K!  &nbsp;  *gasp* thanks.  *rolls eye*

      "Tug-O-OKW "   Background.   OKW is&nbsp;a man covering many duties. He has his hands full.  With so many responsibilities and only 9 hours of available meeting times, there are often tug-o-OKWs. Today, i happen to withness the most verbal and balant!   Contestants  On my right: Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me On my left: Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U   Round 1, Fight!    &nbsp; Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp; : " Hey, can u release OKW for this meeting i have at 4&nbsp;pm?"&nbsp; Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : " I cannot. This is a very impt meeting with Mr HIT-man, we have to decide and commit deadlines, so we can go talk to Mr Big-Shot-User on Monday"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp; : " But i booked him so long ago, u cannot just barge in like that."&nbsp; Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : " We need to look at the importance of the meeting. Can't someone else stand in place of OKW for your closure meeting?? "  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp; : " No. No one can stand in for the almighty OKW. Can someone else like Mr Probably-Know-Not-What-To-Say stand in for OKW on ur side then?"&nbsp; Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : " Of cos cannot, he will not know what to say!! "  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp; : "&nbsp;Can u help me out on this?"&nbsp; Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : " If i help you, who will help me?"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp; : "&nbsp;This is really important and it is very difficult to get everyone. " Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : "&nbsp;So yours is high priority lah... Must give in to you issit?"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me&nbsp;gasped in desperation and picks up the phone to call the secretary of Mr Hit-Man to try to push the meeting back for Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U.  After which, Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U called the same secretary NOT to push back the meeting and&nbsp;made her remind Mr Hit-Man to be on time for the meeting.   Till the next time of "Tug-O-OKW ". Stay tuned.     *man.. I would hate to be the secretary*  &nbsp;

      Suddenly hit me today&nbsp;over a meeting why i have been feeling&nbsp;less motivated at work these days.   ONE WORD: Ownership   I dun feel i own any portion of the current project.   In my previous projects, I owned portions/ modules of the project.  My first project,&nbsp;I was the APL and owned 3 modules.  My second project, i owned another 3 modules.  And this one, i basically owned nothing. In this phase, I have no role to play. I am not in a position to push the messed up project. I dun feel that i am contributing to the progress. I am not used to take on such a passive role. This is driving me mad.   Feeling a little lost. I am basically working on MISC items.   Should i "jump ship" to another project to take on a bigger role?  I feel like i am stagnant-ing here.&nbsp;I might just rot and vegetate.  I mean what am i to write in my appraisal next year.   I dun want to be like those forgotten workers -->Swept under the carpet and FORGOTTEN!    *I DUN WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN*    ~fear~     &nbsp;

      Many times, i question myself, how can it be possible that the bosses do not know that some people are obviously sucking up to him / her?&nbsp; I am totally grossed out here!   I mean time and again, i withness these "SUCKERS"&nbsp;at work. "Suckers" are people who practises SUCK UP. I mean they huddle around the boss. Say nice things to make him laugh and make him feel wise / important. This is a recurring exercise!&nbsp;Frequency: At least once a day!   And it doesnt help if these SUCKERS work in a team. You will withness a bunch of low life suckers grovelling at that one man's feet. "Ohhhh!! Not worthy. My great one."   *gasp*   bimbo SUCKER goes, " there is no right or wrong answer what...", batter eyelids and flings her hair backwards  boss goes, "of cos there is.. Need to see the way they think..blah blah blah..." beaming with glee that he has managed to "outwit" her yet another time. Both laughs.   *duh*    Save me...   ~cringe~

      So, we were in Tioman.  What's next?!   Sat 24/7/2004 1200hrs : Gathered at Fishermen's Diving Sch. Had to rig up the equipment.  *Huff puff* Oh man..   Confusion.   "Regulator is to come from left or from right again? "  "PPppppsssss... What is that? Is my tank leaking? "*panic* "Hello!!! I think my tank is leaking!"   "Oh man.. Why is it the tube to my BCD doesnt fix in nicely? "*tries again and again* "Hello!! I think there is something wrong with my BCD.. the tube doesnt fix into it..."   My mask looks like it is goin to snap, got a replacement with an attached snorkel. Gosh!! There was algae all over. I refused to get into the water until i scrubbed it clean.. I went over to the common wash area&nbsp;in attempt to clean it.&nbsp;Eekks!! i think the algae has sunken its roots to the core of the silicon. *sigh* Have to make do with it. *gulp*"WHY ME??!!"   Sat 24/7/2004 1230hrs : Finally all rigged up. Went&nbsp;to the shore for my entry.  Goodness!! IT WAS soooo&nbsp;DIRTY!! It was as if i was walking into the bowl of seaweed soup! Only that is was green and murky. There were floating&nbsp;seaweed everywhere. Man!! i am DISGUSTED! G.R.O.S.S.   Sat 24/7/2004 1240hrs : Everyone struggled into the water. We commenced class.   Revised mask clearing and emergency air sharing. Hmm.. noticed that my buddy has improved somewhat.   Man.. Saw fishes!! It was as if I was in a HUGE fish tank. Where the jetty was, there was this huge shoal of kuning. *gasp* There must have been at least a thousand little fishes. I was exhilarated!   Sat 24/7/2004 1400hrs :&nbsp; Class ended. Clumsily walked out of the water and unrigged.   Sat 24/7/2004 1405hrs :&nbsp; Had a pretty good lunch. Gosh. The sambal sotong was solid!   Sat 24/7/2004 1410hrs :&nbsp; Hmtan persuaded me we should try some local fare after he caught a glimpse of the most delicious looking goreng pisang.&nbsp;   Sat 24/7/2004 1411 hrs : Decided not to, cos those&nbsp;were unwanted carbs   Sat 24/7/2004 1412 hrs : Lost to my evil self. What the heck! Let's jus eat!! :)   Sat 24/7/2004 1415 hrs : Bought and ate the most gorgeous goreng pisang. Note --> it was G.O.R.G.E.O.U.S.   Sat 24/7/2004 1445 hrs : Was sitting around Fishermen and was observing the divers.   And my attention was drawn to the common washing area. People simply huddle around the area. And to my HORROR, I saw someone stuck his feet into the water for a quick wash. *puke* All of us clean our equipment there, like our regulator, snorkel, etc. I MUST HAVE INDIRECTLY kissed a thousand feet *VOMIT* i felt the pisang turned in my stomach.   Sat 24/7/2004 1500 hrs: Couldnt get over the disgust. But it was time for my Second dive. Went further out the sea. Saw a lot of dead corals. Felt a little sad. Not to mention disgusted with the&nbsp;dirty-feet-contaminated regulator in my mouth.&nbsp;   Sat 24/7/2004 1545 hrs: They taught&nbsp;towing. 2 types. Pull / Push.  Pull involves the tow-er to fin on the back and drag the tow-ee on his/ her back.  Push involves the towee to put his/her fins on the shoulders of tow-er and the tower simply kicks on the front.   Oh man!!  Push tow was so awkard for me.&nbsp;No explanations needed for this.&nbsp;It is jus&nbsp;erm&nbsp;*duh*   Anyway,&nbsp;buddy was too weak. He feels tired after every 10 kicks. I ended towing him 3/4 of the way.&nbsp;"Think it was a blow to his&nbsp;ego."   We went out further. Dive to abt 6-7 m deep. Saw almost nothing. Only white coarse sand. The corals&nbsp;we saw were dark grey. And very few small fishes. Disappointed.   Sat 24/7/2004 1630 hrs: Class ended. We struggled back on shore. I asked Matt (Dive Master) if the corals we are going to see are all going to be like that. His reply was that there is no sun. Essentially the corals will need the sun to reflect its colours.    *really??!!*     &nbsp;  &nbsp;Sat 24/7/2004 1700 hrs: Shower.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Awful tan line. I was wearing a short suit and now i have 1. arm line 2. shorts line 3. bootie line.&nbsp; Nooooooooooooooo.. Not 1 awful tan line, but 3!!   Sat 24/7/2004 1900hrs: Met the rest up for dinner. Went to this Chinese restuarant for pretty good Chinese food. :)&nbsp; Saved stomach space for Ramly burger.   Sat 24/7/2004&nbsp;2000hrs: Ramly was closed. Darn. They went for coffee and ice cream. My evil twin stole 2 spoonsful of ice cream and pancake from HMTAN and OKW.   Sat 24/7/2004 2100hrs: Met at Fishermen for test. It was an open book test. But guess what, they left all of us in the room unattended. We did what university taught us best. COPY! *hahahah*   Sat 24/7/2004 2145hrs:  Had 50/50 ! cool! hahah so much for studying huh??! Was told to meet at 7 am for our open water dive tomorrow.&nbsp; *SHOCKED*   Sat 24/7/2004 2200hrs: Washed up and zzzzzzzzz   Sun 25/7/2004 0645hrs: Saudi woke us up. Washed up and&nbsp;quickly left. (Saudi was one of my roommate. Stout funky gungho gal, attending the course with a girly chick, Yvonne. Saudi had a tatoo on her back. *ouch*&nbsp;mmmmm....&nbsp;)&nbsp;   &nbsp;Sun 25/7/2004 0705hrs: On the boat, human-chained the bags AND the TANKS on board.  oh man the TANKS!!   Sun 25/7/2004 0715hrs: Off to Rengis!   Sun 25/7/2004 0730hrs: Giant stride entry. WWWHHhhhhheeeee..  Dive to 9 m depth.. Man!!   Sea Urchin colony. Couldnt land. Kept finning. Followed the Matt everywhere. Kept hitting everyone. Everyone was doing the same. Everyone was slamming into each other and trying to stay afloat so as not to end up as a sea urchin needle pillow! It was hilarious.   Highlight of this dive: I saw Nemo's cousins! They were hiding in some wavy corals. Matt kinda poked at some corals and I saw 2 heads popped out.. They were so cute. *clap clap clap*  I&nbsp;dare not touch them thinking i might end up hurting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Saw plenty of small colourful fishes. Some which i can recall off hand were neon blue, some geen, some neon pink, and some zebra stripped fish.   Sun 25/7/2004 0820hrs: Out from the waters. Climbed on board. Cool stuff!!   Sun 25/7/2004 0830hrs: Breakfast was disappointing. Some fusion Malaysian-Tioman-US pancake with Honey. *puke* But i was hungry, so it will do for now.   Sun 25/7/2004 0910hrs: Second dive site. Soyak! Depth of 10.5 m. Cool stuff. I swam in a school of fish. Not sure what its name was. And i was told after i came out of the water that i had a sucker fish nibbling at my bootie all the time. *hahaha* I was a swimming happy meal. At least i knew between the 2 of us that one of us is fat/fed and satisfied.   Well, the corals still appeared mostly dull grey. So&nbsp;Matt's theory dun hold.&nbsp;So much for the sunlight reflecting the corals huh?! *duh*   Sun 25/7/2004 1030hrs:&nbsp;Surface from my last&nbsp;dive. Climbed out from the sea.&nbsp;We unrigged and was busily packing when&nbsp;Matt told us to&nbsp;gather upstairs.&nbsp;   Sun 25/7/2004 1035hrs:&nbsp;GRADUATION JUMP.&nbsp;   Matt&nbsp;wanted us to dive from level 2 of the boat into the open sea as to celebrate our graduation!! heheheh.&nbsp;I was contemplating to do a&nbsp;backward front flip&nbsp;dive to impress the entire cohort. But oh well, humility took over. I did a simple plunge and won a round of applause!  :o)   Sun 25/7/2004 1220hrs:&nbsp;Packed my bags and gathered onboard.  We are taking the dive boat all the way to Mersing. *GOSH* As it is a huge boat, it&nbsp;couldnt go as fast as the speed boat. It will be traveling slow and steady. Estimated number hours of travel --> 4 hrs! My jaw dropped.   Sun 25/7/2004 1235hrs:&nbsp;Lunch. Some packed fried rice with egg. Not fantastic but edible.   Sun 25/7/2004 1305hrs: Logging our dive in the dive log..   I hear Matt's voice in the backgrd..  Remember what i said abt moving vehicle&nbsp;almost 100% equates to sleep. It happened again. I totally dozed off.&nbsp;Not sure&nbsp;how long, but i felt someone&nbsp;snug at my dive log.&nbsp;OKW took the dive log and &nbsp;helped me fill in the details. *thankie you*  I&nbsp;was in la la land. I was swimming admist sucker fishes nibbling away from my regulator as they like the feet contaminated taste. *gulp* *puke*   Sun 25/7/2004 1505hrs: Brother 2.   I was awakened by laughter. hmtan, okw, ckaren and one of her friends were in a game of Brother 2!! I joined in. Man. I think Feng-shui for me was terok! I lost 7/12 games. The odds were against me. I decided to open the door to change the wind(feng). And guess what. I still lost!! hahaha so it has nothing to do with Feng-shui!   Sun 25/7/2004 1610hrs: Arrived in Mersing.  Think they found their conscience. They actually said, "Ladies can stand aside while the men helped with the bags" I think they have lost their marbles in the Tioman. But what the heck! Oh rapture! No heavy diving equipment mesh bag for me.. WHooohooo!!   Sun 25/7/2004 1620hrs: Horror! One of our buses had a broken air con. They have decided to drop us of at sme Chinese resturant for an early dinner while they attempt to change a new big bus for us.   That was their story. But i was thinking that the bus company must have been paid commission to bring tourists to the resturant. Cos i heard that they have been encountering problems everytime they go back. "First to arrive in Mersing and last in Singapore." *duh* Change the bus company??!!   But lunch wasnt all too bad. Had a seafood feast for 10 pax for only RM 180! It was almost FREE!! hahaha.. not to mention, my EVIL twin returned. I had no part in the raveneous gorging! * sheepish look *   Sun 25/7/2004 1710hrs: The bus convieniently arrived&nbsp;to drop another cohort of tourists to pick us up. (Man!! dun these people see&nbsp;it?)&nbsp;It was a luxurious bus! Plenty of leg room.   Sun 25/7/2004 1720hrs: Brother 2 continues. We figured an ingenius way to form a table. We turned a back pack the other way where the back faces the sky and hooked the shoulder strap to the arm rest to form a table. 4 of us OKW, HMTAN, CKAREN and myself played the trip away!!   Sun 25/7/2004 2100hrs: Arrived in JB.   Heading towards the checkpoint. All the pushing and hussling. Cleared the Malaysian immigration. Was walking with my buddy amidst the crazy weekend JB crowd to look for our bus.  Spotted the bus. Was impossible to cut thru the crowd...Hmm.. Saw a little opening from the bus platform. And i suggested to my buddy why dun we quickly cut across from the bus platform. And we did.  Next,&nbsp;we heard a series of honks!! And saw plenty of angry bus drivers raising their hand, questioning what the hell we are doing...?   Man, we could have been killed. I mean what a shame it would be to tell pple u died on the way back from JB to Singapore from a diving trip to Tioman. I took off and buddy followed. We dashed to our bus! HONK !! HONK!!"  Sun 25/7/2004 2130hrs: Had to carry the dive bag cross the Singapore immigration! *huff puff* Man!! My arms are breaking!!!   Sun 25/7/2004 2140hrs: Byes everyone, not a bad trip at all!! See yaa!!!&nbsp;    I made it there and back alive!   :o)&nbsp;

Excerpts.&nbsp;   Fri  23/7/2004&nbsp;&nbsp;1900hrs: Rushed off from work to meet the rest at Kranji MRT at 745 pm.   23/7/2004&nbsp; 1915hrs: On the train. Got an SMS that the bus&nbsp;will be late. Will arrive at 2045hrs! Oh man!! What am i going to do for 1 hr!?!   23/7/2004&nbsp; 1945hrs: Arrived at Kranji. Called Keng Wah. He was sitting on some stairway, reading the manual for the test. The test! Sudden realization that i havent read the manual or watched the VCD. Okay, so i am going to fail the theory test.  And hmtan forgot his divelog/ card and all. Turned back from Bishan MRT to home. Lucky bugger. Spared from the long wait.   23/7/2004&nbsp; 2045hrs: Finally! Bus came. Hmtan nowhere in sight. Went onto the bus, waited.   23/7/2004 2050hrs: Arrival of Mr HMTAN. Off to the Check point.   23/7/2004 2120hrs: Cleared immigration. On our way to "pitstop" Projet !?? Question: What / Where is Projet?&nbsp;   23/7/2004 2200hrs: Answer: An upclass kiosk, selling all sorts of tidbits, munch, hot food, drinks and all in the middle of some highway to Mersing. Had the most sumptous dry cupa-noodle~ Maggie Mee Goreng. Havent had something like that in&nbsp;a long time!! Happy food.   23/7/2004 2215hrs: Fat/Fed and Satisfied. Driver sped on, &nbsp;to Mersing.   SAT  24/7/2004 0020hrs: Woke up to find out i was in Mersing and a sharp pain of the right side of my head. Think the rocking motion of the bus + digestion of the 30g of carbs and fats put me off to sound sleep. Headache must have been from the constant knocking against the window. Lugged all our bags up to our room. Washed up and more zzzzzzzzzzzzz..   24/7/2004 0645hrs: Wakey wakey. And makan! the hotel breakfast was not too bad.. YUMMOS.   24/7/2004 0715hrs:&nbsp;Onto the hotel bus to Mersing jetty.   24/7/2004 0717hrs: Got off the bus. Lugged the bags. Oh! The heavy diving equipment!!&nbsp;&nbsp;To the jetty.   24/7/2004 0718hrs: WHERE IS MY HANDBAG?! MY PASSPORT!! MY WALLET!! MY IDENTIFICATION! Must have left it on the HOTEL BUS!! OH NO!! ARGH!! Must missed that bag out in all the the hussle!!   24/7/2004 0725hrs: Hotel bus returns with my handbag. *sheepish grin* Hanging on to my handbag&nbsp;with my DEAR LIFE!   24/7/2004 0745hrs: Right in front of the queue. BUT! Boat came. Boat left. It is never our turn.&nbsp;"What??!! Not again?! This is the 3rd boat that is not OURS?!"   24/7/2004 0800hrs: Finally. On the speed boat. "Human-chained" the bags onto the boat! OH THE HEAVY BAGS!!   24/7/2004 0805hrs: The speed boat took off. "HFRRrrrrmmmm.....HHHHRRRRMmmm!" Realised that most of the windows are closed. Thought it will be nice to have some wind in my hair. Opened the window. Indeed, the wind was refreshing! And so was the splash that came along with it! Ok.. maybe that was why they closed the window. Followed likewise. Stuffy enclosure.   24/7/2004 0810hrs: Took my text, Attempted to read.   24/7/2004 0815hrs: Closed the text. It was impossible. Getting DROWSY. I am beginning to think&nbsp;moving vehicle will almost 100% equate to sleep   24/7/2004 0915hrs: Engine ceased. The silence was deafening! And the boat was rocking!  Have we arrived..?! Doesnt seem like it. My&nbsp;Dive Master was sitting still.&nbsp;Some villagers were trying to get off. Our boat was parked alongside another boat that was along the the jetty.   Another boat came next to us. An Ang Moh family&nbsp;were trying to get on. It is hilarious to see these Ang Mohs wrapped up in black trash bags to keep themselves dry. THE TRASH BAG FAMILY! *hahah*   Heard some commotion. Apparently, the villagers threw their bags on board the boat next to the jetty to get on. However, that boat had&nbsp;pulled off and were leaving with them. Oh man! For the next 15-20 mins, the boat men were simply screaming at each other to figure out how to park their boats so as to 1. retrieve the bags 2. to let the villagers onto the jetty 3. to let the RUBBISH BAG family on 4. to let the boat with the bags out. Note that the sea was really choppy and our speedboat rocked in crazy manner. I was turning GREEN. I felt my stomach churned.   24/7/2004 0930hrs: We managed to get out of it. The engine started and sped off. *STOMACH churning*   24/7/2004 0940hrs: Another jetty. Is it our turn yet? Nah.. *STOMACH churning harder*   24/7/2004 0950hrs: Yet another jetty. Is it our turn yet? Nah... *STOMACH churning. Think concrete mixer*   24/7/2004 1000hrs: YES!! we are at SALANG!! HUMAN CHAINED the bags off the boat. Stepped foot onto SALANG. Breathe hard. Caught a glimpse of the village. It was not the resort i imagined. But what the heck! the only thought right now is to "RELEASE"!!   Dashed to the toilet!  *AAaaaaaaahhhhhh* Relief from the release.    I MADE IT TO TIOMAN&nbsp;ALIVE!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Found this interesting article on the web.  Hmm.. identify with the inner voice, screaming in my head. I think that is why i am feeling depressed?!  -------------------------  My shameful secret is out: I cannot write. I have been sitting for two hours now, my pen idling over my page. My mind is barren of fresh ideas, my thoughts are cranky and resistant. I have been calling to the winds for inspiration but it hasn’t come. It’s almost noon and my writing boat hasn’t even left the shore. A secret voice hisses in my ear: “Call yourself a writer? Ha, you have nothing to say, everything you want to say has been said before. You got assigned this column because you smart-talked your way into it, but now you’re caught. Your time’s up, you fraud.”  But I have hundreds of very flattering e-mails in my inbox, I plead. I have been writing for almost two decades. The ominous voice hisses back: “You fooled all those people, but it can’t last. You may have written a few good pieces but that’s all you’ve got in you. It was all a fluke.” It’s familiar, this voice. It comes every now and then, especially when I have a creative block as I do now. Or each time I start a new job. It says: You’re not good enough. You don’t really deserve this job. It’s only a matter of time before you are found out. It first came years ago when I got admission into one of the world’s best universities: “You managed to get in somehow but now you’re sunk,” went the voice. “All those other people out there are much smarter than you.” Since then I’ve heard it each time I’ve had to handle a big project or have landed a top job. The more senior the position, the louder it whispers: “Imposter.”  Thank goodness I recognise it because now I can tell it to shut up.  Researchers says that these vague feelings of self-doubt, intellectual fraudulence and anxiety are so common among people, it’s almost an epidemic. The “imposter syndrome” strikes people everywhere, especially high achievers. It makes them discount their success attributing it to luck, not real ability. Along with it comes the fear that anytime they could be found out. The more successful you get, the greater the inner stress. Now people have expectations of you that you may not be able to meet. Now each decision you make should be perfect because there’s much to lose.  Success. It can come with handcuffs.  Research into the “imposter syndrome” first began in 1978 by two psychotherapists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes who studied a group of successful, high-achieving women. They found that these women had high levels of self-doubt and an inability to internalise their success. They believed they were “fooling” other people, that they got where they did because of contacts or luck — even when a reality check proved that the exact opposite was true. External proofs of excellence — academic degrees, awards, promotions — were routinely dismissed. As researcher Dr Valerie Young put it: “Rather than offering assurance, each new achievement and subsequent challenge only serves to intensify the ever present fear of being...found out.”  Often it’s the smartest people who suffer most. As children they are told how intelligent and exceptional they are. And then, as they grow up, they invariably encounter tasks that are not so easy, where they don’t have all the answers. Suddenly they have to accept that they aren’t so special, that they may actually be only average, even dumb...an imposter. It’s the dirty little secret many smart people share — and no one tells.  I personally know dozens of “imposters”. Like this man who worked very hard to become CEO of his company, got the job — and is now panicking because suddenly he thinks he’s not really good enough for it. Or another friend who sings beautifully but thinks he’s a fraud because he doesn’t sing as well as Bhimsen Joshi. Or this young woman I know who started out as a secretary and who at age 29, is now vice-president of a very successful company. A hard-working, determined woman, she has also managed to build her own home, one of the youngest people I know to have done so. And yet she too feels like a fraud. But if she is a fraud, then who was it who achieved all those successes?  A few weeks ago I reconnected with an old friend, a gifted journalist, via e-mail. She has done remarkably well for herself in the software industry, spearheading a project that was good enough to survive the dotcom typhoon. She sent me an e-mail and these are her exact words: “I can’t believe I make my living as a techie. I feel like such a poseur until I remind myself I’ve successfully delivered projects more effectively and quickly than guys with advanced degrees in computer science. But I still feel like I’m going to be shown up some day.”  A long-time teacher posted this message on the Net: “Often I have felt the ‘imposter syndrome’ as an academic — that sooner or later, someone somewhere is going to figure out I don’t know what the heck I am doing.”  Interestingly, real imposters never suffer from these feelings. Nor do people who are struggling to survive have the time to luxuriate in such thoughts. I can’t imagine my driver thinking: “I’ve been driving for 20 years but I’m actually a fake. One day they’ll know I can’t really drive at all.”  The good news is that once you figure out how this Imposter scoundrel operates, you can get him before he gets you. You know he’s hovering around when you find yourself thinking such thoughts: “I give the impression of being more competent than I actually am.” Or “I’m afraid people will discover how much knowledge or ability I really lack.” Or “Everyone else is smarter than I am.”  The Imposter lies. You can defuse it by doing a reality check of what you have actually achieved. It also helps to know that sometime you’re good and sometime you’re not (helps to also know the same about Sachin Tendulkar. Sometime he scores a century, and sometime nothing at all). Helps to know that a creative block is just a creative block — a small bump on the road. Not a signal that you’ve been in the wrong career for years.  Helps to know that the Imposter can feel like a psychological anaconda, but is only a mere mosquito. Shoo it away when it comes and get back to work.  And it sure helps to remember the joke: “What do you call an imposter ten years from now?” Boss

      Went to see the company doctor this morning.  I had a budge on my wrist for a while now. I had gone to another doctor earlier and he did say it was ganglia. So i told this doc that I have a problem on my wrist and the last doc said it was ganglia.  So this company doc took my wrist and poked at it TWICE. And said, "Ok, so u have to go Ocean Bldg to get it removed. It is goin to be a day surgery and U will be on MC for a few days".  Come on, he only took a glance at it ONCE, poked at it TWICE and he is sooo SURE it was GANGLIA!! And he is sending me to the op table.  How can u be sooo SURE??!!  I refused to go TODAY ( comeon they actually wanted me to go TODAY!! ) and decided to get another opinion!   No way am i goin in without an X-Ray or detailed examination!    ===================  Cysts - ganglion cysts  ===================  A tendon is a tough band of connective tissue that joins muscle to bone. Tendons and joints have a covering of membrane that produces a lubricating fluid to assist their function. A ganglion cyst is a benign (non-cancerous) ball of fluid that grows on the membrane or sheath that covers these tendons and joints. The backs of the hands and wrists are most commonly affected, but ganglion cysts can sometimes grow on the feet, knees and ankles. A ganglion cyst is the most common lump on the hand, and tends to target women between the ages of 20 and 40 years of age, for reasons unknown. As tendons anchor muscle to bone, a ganglion cyst on a tendon may cause muscle weakness. Depending on the individual, there may be just one large lump or a collection of many smaller ones attached to a single 'stalk' deeper in the tissue. Around one third to one half of ganglion cysts disappear on their own without the need for medical treatment. However, it is best to consult your doctor to make sure the swelling is not a symptom of some other type of illness.   Symptoms  The symptoms of a ganglion cyst include: Noticeable swelling or lump. The lump is able to change its size, including going away completely only to return. The lump is usually soft and immobile. In some cases, the lump is painful and aching, particularly those at the base of fingers. The ache and pain is made worse by moving any nearby joints. The affected tendon may cause a sensation of muscular weakness. The back of the hands and wrists are most commonly affected. Other sites include the back of the knee (Bakers cyst), ankle, foot, palm and fingers.  The cause is unknown No one knows what causes a ganglion cyst to form. Some of the theories include: The body responds to injury, trauma or overuse by forming an internal 'blister'. Small tears in the tendon membrane or joint capsule allow the contents to squeeze out.Ganglion cysts can disappear Around 30 to 50 per cent of ganglion cysts disappear by themselves without the need for medical treatment. However, it is always best to consult your doctor to make sure the lump isn't a symptom of some other disease. If your ganglion cyst is painful, or if it interferes with your mobility or causes sensations of numbness or pins and needles, see your doctor.   Diagnostic methods   Ganglion cysts are diagnosed using a number of tests including: Medical history Physical examination Ultrasound X-rays Needle aspiration (a fine needle is used to draw off fluid, which is then examined in a laboratory).   Treatment options   Ganglion cysts used to be treated by slamming them with a heavy book such as a Bible - which explains the term 'Bible therapy'. This isn't a good idea, as you could cause further injury.  Medical treatment options include: Close monitoring - if the ganglion cyst isn't causing pain or interfering with movement, some doctors prefer to wait and see. The cyst may simply disappear on its own. Needle aspiration - one of the tests to diagnose ganglion cysts involves drawing off the fluid with a fine needle. In many cases (around 75 per cent), this treatment empties the cyst and no further action is needed. Surgery - the cyst or cysts are surgically removed, usually by a specialist such as an orthopaedic surgeon. Ganglion cysts of the feet will usually require surgery.Joint mobility after treatment. Whether your ganglion cyst is aspirated or surgically removed, you will be fitted with a splint for around one week or so. Depending on the location of the excised ganglion cyst, full recovery can be anywhere from two to eight weeks. Be guided by your doctor or health care professional, but generally it is best to get the joint moving again as soon as possible. Using splints for extended periods of time can actually hamper joint mobility. Your doctor will give you specific exercises to perform.Ganglion cysts may return. Ganglion cysts may grow back after treatment. This is less likely if your cysts were surgically removed rather than aspirated with a needle. Some estimates suggest that around half of patients who undergo needle aspiration can expect a recurrence. Since the cause of ganglion cysts is unknown, prevention is impossible. If you suspect your ganglion cyst is recurring, see your doctor for further treatment. A ganglion cyst that is aspirated three times has a better than 80 per cent chance of being cured.   Where to get help  Your doctor Orthopaedic surgeon

      Think i am pretty accident prone. Dinner over Thur nite, i was accidentally jabbed by a old, rusty nail. It was a pretty small wound, so after the bleeding stopped, i kinda ignored it.  Nonetheless, the area around the wound became a little red and puffy on Fri. And at the back of my mind, i was thinking about the possibility of infection and even worse, tentanus.  Did some reading up on tentanus, ====One of the questions=====  Was the cut or puncture from dirty or contaminated objects, such as rusty nails or objects in the soil or did a puncture go through a shoe, especially a rubber-soled one? (Note: you will need a tentanus shot if you have not had one within 5 years (for a major wound) or if you had not had one in the last 10 years (for a minor wound).) If yes to one of these symptoms described above, please see your doctor. ======================  Was feeling ok till abt 9+ pm at nite, when i started feeling weak and a little feverish. I mean a lot of thoughts were running through my mind.  Will the doctor laugh at me cos the wound is so small? Am i over-reacting? Am i jus sleepy? Will it be too late if i dun do something abt it soon?  In the end, i decided to pop over to the docs anyway. Afterall, better be safe then very sorry.    ~jab~     *ouch* and no.. the doc didnt laugh at me

      Met up with my sec sch gal prefect gang on Sat. It was on the pretext to celebrate Seri's marriage. Was good to meet up and to catch on what's happening.  Seri - Flying with SIA, married. Alicia - Masters in Material Sci, seeing an Indonesian Shawn - Masters in Chem, unattached at the moment. Simin - Masters in Archi, seeing a Brit Cheryl - Working with a startup, enjoying her job, heading to India this yr end on a pilgrimage, seeing a Msian.  Suddenly, i realise a trend. A growing female proportion are not seeing local Singaporean men. I mean outta that 6 females, 4 (including myself) are seeing men from other countries whilst 1 is unattached and the other married to a native Malay.  That is pretty interesting.  Cheryl was telling me that there is such a thing called a Working holiday visa, where u can be employed over ur holiday. And she is thinking of applying for one since her Msian boy is currently in UK.  *gasp* me too.. so i can be with my dearie in Melb.  I looked up on holiday visa to Aust ... ============================================================ Nationals of some countries (who are under 31 years of age) are able to obtain a Working Holiday Maker visa that allows short term employment combined with visiting Australia for up to one year. At this stage, Singapore nationals are NOT entitled to working holiday visas. Check Fact Sheet 55 at  www.immi.gov.au  for more details and a list of eligible nationalities. ============================================================  to my disappointment.................... *sigh*
