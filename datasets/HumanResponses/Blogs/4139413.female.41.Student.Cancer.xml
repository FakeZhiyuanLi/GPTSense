						       I know, I haven't posted in a few days (like anyone cares but me!). Things have been a bit busy. Even things at work have picked up. Tonight, though, I have been working on Spanish notes trying to get ready for the new semster. Only a few more days!       I had a scare tonight. Mike IM'd me and told me that Dennis had been in an accident. Scared the shit out of me. He's ok, and the truck is still drivable. I got to talk to him briefly but I am not sure about what really happened.        it's about time for me to go home. More later.

						   It has been a wonderful weekend! Today is my son's 17th birthday. It is still hard to believe that my baby is all but grown up! I think he has had a good birthday, too. He spent yesterday with his girlfriend. Today we all met at Becky's house for a birthday lunch. We made enchiladas and Mexican rice and baked him a chocolate cake. Everyone but Jimmy was there. Dennis and I (mostly Dennis)  got him an accustic guitar, I got him some Zelaznay books, Becky and John got him a new (used) amp for his electric guitar that has special features on it, and Jessi gave him $10. Plus John got his car on the road and Mike got to drive it briefly. Insentive to get his license, I think! Dennis and I had a wonderful weekend, too. Friday night we just watched some movies at home, and cooked on the grill. Nice and relaxing. Saturday, as I said, Mike took off, so Dennis and I had the day. We took Mike out to his girlfriends, then did a little bit of 'road farming' (taking off down country roads which we have never been down and have no idea where they lead). When we got back into c'ville we went to Woody's for lunch and sat for a while just talking. We headed back home to do some housework and yard work. We made it as far as to pick the remaining green beans from the garden and walk over to the next door neighbors to give it to them. Russ offered Dennis a beer and you can about guess the rest! We all sat talking for about and hour or more, until I finally said I had to get my shower to get ready for our dinner that night. I left Dennis there and that's where I found him 45 minutes later when I came back! So I sat down and joined them. By this time Dennis was feeling pretty good. Every time Dennis would say we have to go, Russ would open him another beer... By the time we left Dennis was talking with his eyes closed and was barely able to stumble home. But he was in a very good mood. I got him to get into the shower and I fixed him a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches to eat thinking some food in his belly might slow down the alcohol a bit. He was so funny! I laughed so hard my cheeks hurt. We did finally make it to our dinner at the American Legion, where surprizingly enough he ate dinner first (some very fine catfish, btw) and during the course of the evening only drank two more beers (at least until we got back home!). It was a wonderful day, I haven't laughed as much or as hard in more time that I can remember.

						      Only two things in this life are truly difficult to live with - boredom and loneliness. Boredom generally goes hand in hand with lack of productivity and purpose. Without purpose, why do anything? why get up in the morning? why go to bed at night? why do the dishe? take a shower? brush your teeth? Most of the same questions can be asked when you are alone. Not just alone, but lonely. I have been alone yet not felt lonely. and I have been in a room full of people and felt utterly alone. Although I never wish again to be so completly and totally dependent on another person that they are my sole purpose in life, life without someone to share it with - I mean truly share it with - is pointless, empty, and hollow. But my life does not hinge on just one person. For the first time in my adult life, I truly have a mass (a small mass, perhaps better called a cluster) of people in my life. Although he gets angry (defensive?) when I say he is number one in my life, Dennis is number one, the center of my cluster. Not that long ago, my children where, and should have been, number one, but that is no longer needed or appropriate. Just as John and her kids are the center of Becky's life, and Dominic and Jimmy the center of Jessi's life, and Mike is learning how to develope his own life and support system, Dennis is my center. Not only my center, but my best friend and he keeps me grounded, focused, and happy. Of course, though, next come my children, grandchildren and my son-in-law. What a wonderful family they make! I am so proud of them all, and they have just barely begun their lives! Becky and John and their wonderful crew. I am so proud of how hard they both work to provide a happy home for those kids and for each other. And Jessi! Working hard to better herself and not allow herself to fall into the easy outs available to young, single mothers. She could have so easily sat back and let herself became a welfare mother, but she refuses and continues to be the best she can be! Michael, what can I say? I am so glad to see him finally happy and acting like a semi-normal teenage boy. He has so much potential; if only I can figure out how to make him see it for himself! But my life is no longer just my family. It is a new experience for me. I have friends! Iryna, Glenda, Ginny, Kevin, Stacy and Eric, Mike and Roxie, even Sally, for that matter! Last Saturday night was so neat... Dennis and I going over to Kevin and Ginny's for supper and an evening sitting with friends on the patio in the warm summer night, just relaxing and shooting the breeze. How do I explain what it means to me to do something so simple that other people seem to take for granted? What it means to me to know that I have friends, female friends, that I can call up - or who I know will call me - when I am disgusted with Dennis for doing some fool 'man' thing? After so many years of isolation, of no real friends, of thinking that no one would ever like ME, I can not believe that this is truly my life.        Not only do I never have to be alone or lonely, I have purpose in my life. Granted, not every day do I have wonderfully important things to do. Especially right now, often I wake in the morning and wonder why I should get out of my bed. But it is a temporary thing. It is a waiting thing... and it is a summer thing. I have a job! Yes, right now it is extremely boring due to lack of people on campus during the summer. But the job has potiential, and it gives me the opportunity to sit in front of a computer for ungoddly number of hours and do what I want on a top of the line computer and high speed internet access AND GET PAID FOR IT! And it gives me something to do while I wait for classes to start back up in two weeks. Only two more weeks! I love learning! and I have so much to learn still. I love the classrooms, the discussion, the exchange of ideas. Though granted, often in the classes I am in there is little change of ideas, I manage to find some exchange with my friends and with my teachers.        This coming semester is going to be a tough one. Working 20 hours a week plus taking 15 credit hours (5 classes) will not be easy. They are tough classes, too. Spanish II, Math, and three computer classes. All of them will be lots of work outside class. Usually I have at least one class that I can BS my way through - mostly theory type classes, for example my philosopy class and the History class. All of my classes this semster will be long hours of reading and work at the computer. But I can not wait for it to start!        Ok, these ramblings have been going on long enough for tonight.        Later!

						   Yesterday I spent the day cleaning house and watching sappy movies on the Lifetime Movie Channel. Actually I watch one that was pretty good, but the rest were just sappy. I didn't go anywhere, do anything, was barely on the computer at all. Today I have felt like crap. I have been dizzy and light headed all day. I went in for physical therapy, but didn't finish it all. When I got home, in the mail I found the letter from SSI finally. The day has gone down hill from there. I knew I was going to be denied. I don't have a problem with that at all. I am no longer disabled! I am happy that I am no longer disabled! I want to be able to take care of myself. BUT! I can't get any straight answers out of the SS department about what the bottom line of my status is. The paperwork sent me today said that I was a possible canidate for continued benefits under the 301 program. But in another place it said that I AM elegible for continuation under the 301 program. I went in to talk to someone about it. I called twice about it. No one can tell me for sure if I will have an interuption in benefits or not. I HAVE to know and beable to provide documentation so I can have my HUD refigured and apply for food stamps. Between this, my bank account and Aarons, the problems with getting my Voc Rehab vouchers in, and waiting for my Pell money to come, I'm about to go nuts!

						   This day has sucked, big time. I had to deal with Aaron's about causing my bank account to overdraft. He as was a total asshole, but eventually I made him understand that I couldn't afford the $100 in overdraft fees for THEIR mistake. So he credited my account (my Aaron's account, not my bank account) with $100. Of course, although that means I haven't got to make but a $16 payment next month, it does me absolutely no good now. My account is overdrawn by $142 and it will take most if not all of my paycheck on Thursday to put me back into the black. Which will leave me with nothing to live on for the next two weeks. Then I called about my meal ticket with the school only to discover that the voucher that Beth sent from Voc Rehab is $32 short, and then found out that Traffic hasn't even received any paperwork yet. AND Beth was not in the office today, so I couldn't get anything done about it. However, the Bookstore did have my paperwork and I was able to get my books for next semester, plus some basic supplies for both me and Michael. Pens, paper, pencils, etc. And I still have plenty of credit left to go back and get whatever I or Michael might still need. I tried to set up the new bed frame I bought, about killing myself in the effort, only to find out that the damn thing is too small for the full size mattress. So I had to get it back apart and set the old one back up. But I left the headboard where it belongs. I also discoverd that the thing has a horrible musty smell to it. I cleaned it as well as I could with some wood polish/cleaner. We'll see how it is tonight. Now I am at work. Been here 55 mintues and taken one call. FUN!! The guys leave at 9:00 and I am here alone from then until 12:00. Long and boring. My web site is looking pretty good, I think. I still have my "Kathy and the Unicorn" story and "Choices" story to put in, and an "about me" page. But I haven't got those stories ready yet. I might work on one of them tonight. Then again, I might not.

						     Here I sit at work again. One hour and 37 minutes into the shift and not a single call. I will try not to complain, but it is difficult....          My weekend was wonderful! Dennis was home by 4:00 on Thurdsay evening and we spent two hours up at Woody's, then took home supper and sat at home with Mike - a quiet evening at home. Then Friday, Jessi, Mike, Amber and I  (and of course, Dominic) spent the day at the mall. It was fun. Mike bought some school cloths. Then that evening they went to Jessi's and Dennis and I had the evening to ourselves. We sat up at Woody's again - I won $17 playing Ship Captian and Crew! The he took me to eat at Applebee's, and the to see I, Robot. He was so tired, though, he slept through the whole movie. But at least he didn't snore!      Saturday, though, he didn't have to work at all - first day off in about 6 weeks! We drove up to Lafayette and he got new glasses and we went to the Mall. He bought me an outfit to wear to Stacy and Eric's wedding next month. Then we came back into town, relaxed a while then went to Kevin and Ginny's for supper. It was so nice to spend some time with Dennis. It had been so long!     Mike is at his dad's until Thursday. The house is so quiet without him home.     I have a money problem - Aarons took out twice as much as they were supposed to from my checking account, causing me to overdraw. Now not only am I overdrawn by $87, I have no money for the week except the $3 and change I have in my pocket.  I am, of course, going to call them tomorrow and yell at someone and see if I can not get any resetitution, but I am not holding my breath. I really am not good at yelling at people!

						      And I survived the night. Oh, what a wretched night it was! Long and boring at work, very little to do. Then an even longer night at home alone in bed. I could not sleep. At least not for more than an hour or so at a time. Up and down, tossing and turning, dreaming unsettling dreams, reaching for the unreachable. But now, at least the long night is over, and I can head back home to my family and friends. I will see my love tonight!

						     My daughter hurt herself at work last night. Messed up her ankle pretty bad, but she will not go to the doctor and have Workman's Comp take care of it for her. She can't - without risk of losing her job. The idiot smoked pot the other night, and of course they will require a pee test. Considering her boyfriend went through the same thing less than a year ago, you would think she'd have learned and stayed away from the stuff. Of course, though, the folly of youth is that 'it can't happen to me'. So now it has happened to her, and if she seeks treatment, she will have to pay for it out of her own pocket or risk losing her job. STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!

						   As usual, I haven't a clue what I am doing, but of course that doesn't stop me even for a moment! I love writing, but I don't do it often enough. Maybe, if I can figure out all this Blog business, this will be a way to get it done! I have read some of my sons postings, and it seems like a pretty cool way of getting my thoughts out there (like anyone is really intersted!) But I might surprise you all with what I will  have to say - once I figure out what I am doing and how this all works! Later!
