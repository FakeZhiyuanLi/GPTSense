      The purpose of this blog is to track my progress as my life takes a new direction.  After a few years of drifting I've set a new path; new life goals.  I will also use this blog to reflect on current events and my reaction to them.  I've been reading blogs for a couple of years now so it I've decided to take the plunge.  Hopefully I will not bore anyone to tears.

      Here it is the beginning of the third week of my shortened Summer Semester at City College of San Francisco.  I am taking Physiology as the first of 2 prerequisites I need to apply for a Masters of Nursing program.  If anyone reading this blog does NOT find this interesting I don't blame you.  But for me, out of school for over 10 years its a HUGE shock to my system.  I'll reflect more on this tomorrow and start working in some politics!

      So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But, for now, I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater, media, science, athletic or something else.  However, shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them.
