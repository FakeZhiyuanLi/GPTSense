          Yeah its about that time of year where we are told what to do, what to learn, what to teach, wear, speak of, do. Its sad that we all fall for this shit. Society puts such emphasis on education that we learn shit that we'll never use. Since when do we need geometry to be a Network Administrator? I seriously think we should become apprentices of what we want to be when we grow up. Not taught every damn subject under the sun in hopes that we do ourselves some good by picking one to follow. They've fucked up my schedule. I dont know what classes im supposed to go to this year. They've told me that they gave all the parking stickers to the kids that have been to my school one year less than myself so now i cant park. I mean for christ sake, i should be able to park in senior parking. I HAVE been there for 4 years. Just because i stayed back means that i dont get to park up front. Seniority doesn't work out at school. Freshman think they own shit. They don't. You get alot less slack than the freshman cause you are expected to set a good example. What i do doesn't effect anyone at my school unless they are directly related to it. Whats gonna make a freshman be a good kid if i try being one?      Mom is starting to think that im getting depressed and shit again. She knows that i at one point in time thought about killing myself so now she is all spastic if i get worn out from work and the band and start becoming tired all the time. Shit, ive eaten more in the past month than i have in the past year..when i get depressed i dont eat. Wake up! Im not depressed! The only depressing thing in my life right now is the fact that I start PTI pretty soon, im a Junior in high school with braces that wont come off for another year or so, and the girl that i find i could actually have a relationship with lives 700 miles away.     Im going to bed so i can be able to "get up for school tomorrow", oh yay...not. -Mike

          So they werent as bad as i figured they would be. Jenna tried talking to me and criticizing my work. I was like Shut up you fuckin hippy. Who went to enoree for graphic arts? me. thats right. so i know more about this shit than you do. I hate when people do that shit. It pisses me off soo much. Don't tell me how to do something. Ill figure it out for myself. Im very independent. Mom doesn't think i can live on my own. I think she might be true. How would i pay for my crazy meds. I would be one hell of a depressed kid without em. I hate Greenville. I guess i would hate other places as well if i had to live there. Its just the fact that Greenville is nothing to me now. Its just a place i live.  Theres no one to hang with. Nothing to do even if there is someone. Girls down here suck.     The show was actually bad in a sense. We screwed up a few times but we kept goin and it rawked. Half the people left so we turned it into a jam session. We were just like whatever lets just screw up and start over. We got about halfway through back in black which we had never practiced together in our whole bands career and we screwed up so we were just like NEW SONG! and started playing somethin else. It was a practice in a sense. It was totally worth it tho. I mean if you just get 5 mins to play a song on stage its the best feeling in the world. Nothing can touch it. Nothing can bring you down. Its soo much fun.     The ugly...well...i dunno what that would pretain to but hey, i get to go to a show tonight so i might see some ugly fat chick. We'll say its that. As for now im off to celebrate dads b-day over some dinner and then head to the show. Peace. -Mike

          Finally i can get away from all the bullshit that went down with my xanga blog. Its a long story. I just need somewhere that my blog isn't seen by people that I dont want to see it. It's been too much over the past summer. Everything has come falling down ontop of me. Relationships. Life. Friends. Foes. All of it. With the blink of an eye my whole life has changed forever. I've lost friends due to car wrecks and mental wrecks. I soon will become reclusive. Fuck being social at school. It never got me anywhere.  I spent so much time on certain things just to have them blow up in my face. Its like creating a bomb thats so beautiful yet its destruction is horrifying. Its funny how life works. Once you think you are out and clear of the disaster it comes creeping up behind you to slit your throat once again. You fall to the ground and gasp for air as it laughs in your face and then by some grace of whatever the hell it is that put us here, you get up, the cut is gone, you can breathe find and you walk again. This time you are more concious as to what might be behind you. I have good friends. The ones that have been with me for 5 years through thick and thin. Even after my arrest they didn't think differently of me. Yet all the ones that i thought were my true friends couldn't trust me, they couldn't see me the same way. They thought that my arrest made me change for the worse. It made me change for the better. Never once will i do that again. Never once will i step foot in another jail due to my arrest. Never once. I got a job today but yet today has been a relatively shitty day. I am tired, i've been torn apart emotionally, i dont know where anyone is, no one has the time to hang out at the moment, and i need to get the fuck out of this place. Purgatory. Thats all it is. A Purgatory. -Mike
