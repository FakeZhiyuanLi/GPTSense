      german vocabulary lesson of the day: teil - part or segment    finished reading  11 minutes by paolo coelho . well alchemist was better. it wasnt enlightening, but it did bring back some beliefs of my own, which just goes to show i aint some genius bringing new amazing philosophies into the world. damn you paolo coelho for making money off it!  but it did raise a few interesting questions. now why would having sex everyday be so hard? it feels good, it keeps the blood pressure down, why not have more instead of less? on the premise it does only take 11 minutes to finish the act, pero kala ko ba 15 minutes ala  grease , or tipong 7 minutes, like the party game, so ano ba talaga, did paolo time the friggin thing like an experiment.. isn't that so small a teil of time that can easily fit in our daily schedules? a person can easily spend 2-3 hours with a book, others can work 12 hours a day, or commit to 1 hour of exercise, yet not have enough sex with their husband/wife. once again on the assumption sex is more satisfying than a heck of a lot of things. ich kann nicht verstehen. but on the other hand we are still animals, and animals in general have estrus which signals the need reproductive activity. or tipong season to mate, or live only one day and must copulate as many times as possible in that given day to keep the species alive.   on the other hand, who cares anyway?   oh, read  da vinci code by dan brown . many interesting facts. i like the way it doesnt have emotional scenes. it was informative and entertaining, couldnt put it down actually. also another great book is  the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by mark haddon . emotional dissociation was very readable, and refreshing. and just for the romantics, i like the  'slighty'  series.  slighty married  and  slightly tempted  were good. i have to read  slightly dangerous . there are 2 more i think, but i dont feel the need to read the others.   i have  new diet book. called curves, free from cosmo. interesting. its really a good summation of all the popular diets. i will try and lose a few pounds with it.

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: manchmal - sometimes  long day? yes of course. i have 2 weiners and rice.   no matter how suave, handsome, rich and intelligent a guy may be, geht nichts, when he talks about himself in the third person. total verruckt! ne ne ne ne ne.  living in another country is something else. everyday new faces, everyday new words, definitely a thrill.   now what would be a great idea for home is latin night in the discos, well halos wala naman na nagdidisco, pero ok pa rin yun. dancing that way with someone you feel a hormonal connection with. maybe they should bring back that sort of dancing. with steps, not just the gyrating dances of today. and the physiological aspect is when a man dances with a woman smaller than him, he can get a whiff of those pheromones (the are released from the top of your head) and see whether that woman is a possible mate. of course for those who are searching. and for those just having fun, at least you get an endorphine jolt from being with someone who is genetically compatible.    most romantic movie moment : during the final dance in  dirty dancing  when johnny looked at baby and mouthed 'i had the time of my life, no i never felt this way before, yes i swear, it's the truth, and i owe i all to you' and lifted her into the air. aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh   best no-this-is-not-a-rebound song : you got it all (forgot the artist)   sexiest song : crazy for you  madonna    best women-feel-good song : most beautiful girl in the world  prince    most playful song : sweet sexy thing  nu flava    best im-über-infatuated song : crazy in love  beyonce´    coolest dance song : california love  2pac    best it's-the-memories song : times of your life  paul anka    best chill song : crush  dave matthews band    cheesiest yet very effective song : your body is a wonderland  john mayer    best i-want-to-irritate-farty song : morning noon and nighttime (forgot the artist)  our song!! sleep all day  jason mraz

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: böse - evil, wicked, naughty   memoirs of a geisha by arthur golden  is very interesting in the fact that it gives us a glimpse into the closed world that geishas move in. but i dont see it as something very special. why? its just another story of human struggle wrapped in a beautiful kimono. no matter how beautiful the kimono, it is still always just a person inside. the fact of the matter is, the story was sort of like 'the little match girl'. but more exotic. but i enjoyed the historical info. but then i watched a discovery channel special on geisha life, so a lot of the information wasn't very new.   also 1 mills and boon medical romance (they sub-classify romances now. medical romance?? oh well) was a fun light read. i cracked up over the tingles part! its true though, but it also perpetrates a false notion that love is at its most exciting when it begins through some unusual event.  in all honesty fights and disagreements (not out and out shouting matches)really help bring out the best in a couple. it helps the pair grow, and when you have that 1 or 2 day silent period it really makes you miss one another.   and 2 more sci-fi books. now those were good reads. its funny because the whole time i was reading the books i felt i should have been reading them in a different language. maybe its the effect of learning german. in europe you in the proximity of many different languages, in countries which are not even that far from each other. and reading about a whole other planet or other galaxy makes me feel i shouldn't be able to understand a word of what the characters are saying. next one is a 1000 pager by tad williams. he is supposedly a good scifi writer. i will be reading the last of the otherworld series.  i won it! hopefully i'll be getting mg copy of the princess bride in a week or so. i can't wait to watch the movie again.

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: regnerisch - rainy   the sun decided to take another feiertag today. its rainy and cold. down to 13° in the daytime! it's supposed to be june already!  the title is so tita jr! i can imagine the pavpeeps sitting in the econ lobby, mario singing that song as the intro song to our 'radio play' all for fun of course. these people are all so busy with their lives! no one is jobless anymore and all of us are either in school or working. amazing. one of my h.s. barkada has a baby now. i don't know why i wasn't so suprised. maybe its because it had to happen to someone, and im glad it didnt happen to me. that is such a self centered statement. damn. bad trip yun ah.

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: die zeit - the time  german everyday phrase of the day - wie spät ist es? - what time is it?  is death really all that bad? think of armageddon, why do people fear it so much? because we dont know what happens next? well if everyone is gone anyway, then it doesn't really matter then. even typical death. an accident, suicide, getting old. why is it so important? as i see it, it isn't because we are going to miss the person, we are going to miss how the person makes us feel. once again it comes down to how important we are to ourselves. see, if the person who dies doesnt make us feel anything, do we really care? we are sad because the person who dies cannot make us feel happy anymore, cannot share those lonesome moments. but life goes on. we find others to make us happy, we find others to share our lonesome moments. and all we have our memories. people are selfish selfish selfish. so does that make God the most selfish of all? to create and destroy billions and billions of lives? show everyone that he is the ultimate?   sometimes i think its great to be here but sometimes i feel really really homesick. my days are filled with school and whatever other things that i have to do but it really isnt enough. now i just want to read and read to escape. strange, even if i really enjoy my classes and i have good friends, never hungry, have better skin now (my skin is an obsessioN! ive never had good skin!) i think its the absence of a companion. how am i going to make it through the next 4 years? i need prozac! nooo i probably just need a really large dose of chocolate. but then im on a diet. argh! haha. crazy

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: die braut - the bride  just read  the princess bride . i came across it at the local bookstore and just had to read it. it was a favorite movie of mine and my cousins when we were a lot younger. i can still remember inigo montoya saying 'my name is inigo montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.' over and over and over. and when westley fell down the cliff yelling 'as..you..wish..' one of the movies that made an impact on me as a child. how can you not love a movie with robin wright-penn. actually one of the 2 movies i will never forget. the other is  about last night . yup brat pack movie. first time i saw a movie with adult content. i remember seeing the scene with rob lowe in his underwear suddenly falling to the couch with demi. unforgettable.

      german vocabulary lesson&nbsp;of the day: endlich&nbsp;- finally   na klar. heute war schön. das wetter war wünderbar! die sonne scheint, und die luft war kuhl, überall total nett. endlich sommer. wirklich soll den sommer früher zu sein, aber juni war ganz besonders. die leute hat mir erzählt, dass letztes jahr erstaunlich war. trotzdem alles klar. es gefällt mir.   finally some time to myself. i've been writing this blog for sometime now, yet i haven't really said much about myself (height, weight, physical things) . but then who cares? what's important is im in germany. away from everyone. discovering myself? well not really. i know who i am and what i want. i just want to fill my mind with more and more experiences. expand expand.        &nbsp;     in der Ruhe liegt die Kraft  &nbsp;   that is the most powerful expression i have ever heard in my life. loosely translated that would mean "in&nbsp;rest lies strength" or "in stillness lies strength" that is my motto now. i have finally found it. because life kann end in a rush, but most of the time it doesnt. most people live 60, 70, 80 years. and living day to day crazily and without thinking of consequences is just plain doof.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   another thing about people waiting to say 'i love you' and regretting it left unsaid. i don't understand the romanticism in people saying live your life as if everyday was your last. why is it so hard? not because of the meaning of it, but because we are afraid to get rejected. then we should just come out and say it then! do not fear rejection. if we don't get reciprocation, then so what? if it gets thrown into our faces, so what? it's not like we are going to die if we can't have a certain person. it is the romanticism that we let rule our lives. a perfect picture which others write, but we don't need to follow to the letter to prove what we have now is love. my best memories of love weren't the candlelight dinner or the roses (but i really really do love flowers) but the small things that may not matter to anyone else. the things that seem so obtuse and insignificant are the real tells of love.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   what do i remember... when he let himself be pushed into a pool, just so he wouldnt seem a spoilsport in front of me, when he came in a sleeveless shirt even if he looked extremely dumb, because i said it was cute on him. when mr. vain came with his hair parted the other way, looking like a dork, because he was trying to somehow impress me (he was really late pala for school that day, probably in shock from my saying 'yes' over the weekend, haha), when he made&nbsp; stupid chopsticks up his nose to make me laugh. when my baby always remembers that i get sleepy after eating in kobachi, so he brings me home even only after 15 mins in atc, which would irritate the hell out of most guys. all these great great memories. and i can really say it was because i was brave everytime love could come my way. i didn't wait for 6 month courtships. i wasn't necessarily in love before committing. i just knew it would come eventually. definitely decisions made with the mind,&nbsp;though sweeter with whisperings of the heart. they were possible because i opened myself to each and every experience.    &nbsp;

      german vocabulary lesson&nbsp;of the day: wichtig - important   when we walk around, a lot of us are vey oblivious to other people on the street, we look and judge the clothes, the hairstyle, the shoes. but do we really see what's going on? we think the woman with the healthy flushed cheeks&nbsp;is so lucky, but what if she is actually coming from a clandestine meeting with some loser just to get away from the hell of a marriage she is in? but then what if those few stolen moments are the most of exciting of her life? should we also begrudge her that? ahh the constant paradoxes of life.   random events all add up to very important parts of our lives. hmm example? the usual volleyball practices in cuenca, which lead me to notice him, which lead to the short relationship, which lead to interest in fußball, which leads&nbsp;to the pain of the last break-up, leading to an excrutiatingly embarrassing&nbsp;e-mail to my mom, yet it made me realize how much she does care about me and it gives&nbsp;me the confidence, plus the fact it all comes in handy&nbsp;now that i live in a fußball crazy country and is&nbsp;always a good conversation starter, which makes me more confident to talk to my classmates. also from the volleyball in cuenca from the mediocre trainer which lead me to the love of my life now. amazing. too many coincidences that can lead to highs and lows of life. yet another example. my doing so-so in school, which made me want to rise above, which leads me to wanting to study in europe, which leads me to an international degree in medicine, which leads me right now to this exact moment in time, sitting at a computer in germany passing away the scheiße weather.   other examples. my middle brother almost flunking out of college which leads him to going to csb, which leads to him joining an org, which leads him to the girl he is with now, which leads him to finally having a relaitonship, which leads him to realize just how much he is like my dad, which leads him to realizing yes, my dad is human, more than he realizes, and yes he can share and be selfish at the same time. my mother falling in love too early, having me out of wedlock, moving to the US to be with my lola, separating from my father, and meeting a really good guy, whom she is content in life with, which could not have happened if she didn't feel so shitty over what my father did. now she knows contentment. my baby's disappointment over the college ball thing, moving to csb,&nbsp; breaking up from a long time girlfriend, disappointed again over the basketball career, finding me, me constantly being away, making him find a good job which he enjoys now, and helping feel better about himself plus making me very happy to have a stable boyfriend, and making more money than most of his friends, which leads to him being able to go the US and see me in december. wow.   God you are really something else. thanks for giving us this chance to feel both ends of emotion.

      Es gibt keine Vokabel für heute, weil ich diese ganze Blog auf Deutsch probiere zu schreiben.   Man. Heute war schön. Wir haben einen Ausflug durch Köln gemacht. Es interessiert mich die Geschichte der Köln. Romänisches, Mittelalter, und so weiter. Aber war schlimm auf dem Schiff, wenn ein Mädchen auf der Brücke einer Flasche zu uns runtergeschmeisen hat.   &nbsp;

      german vocabulary lesson of the day: der schatz - treasure , darling  &nbsp;  read  the travelling hornplayer &nbsp; the book tickles my sense of happiness and sadness all at one time. shortlisted for the whitebread award pala.  &nbsp;  it's been month. disappointments, ups and downs, yet as they say life goes on. people must once again leave. its so sad how you spend so many hours a day with someone knowing in the end you have to say goodbye, a lot of the time permanently. especially here where i know i will have to leave eventually, people pass through my life (and i theirs) like a ghost passing through a human, it may be brief but you never forget that feeling of contact. prost to all the friends that have come and gone.  &nbsp;  hopefully going to Spain soon! keeping my fingers crossed i can get a really cheap flight soon. have to fly into bilbao pala. kasi yun ang malapit kila elena. so much too write. so little time.  &nbsp;  Sylt war langweilig. Die Insel ist schön, aber gar nichts für junge Leute zu tun. Nach dem Urlaub hatte sie mit mir gepsrochen. Nicht zufrieden?&nbsp;Also.&nbsp;Aber jetzt ist besser. Ehrlich.&nbsp;Die Prufung&nbsp;der Grundstufe III ist endlich vorbei. Ich hatte Angst, aber es war nicht so schwer. Die Mundliche Prufung habe ich gut gefunden. Hoffentlich bestanden alle Leute.&nbsp; Also muss ich bald&nbsp;nach Hause, weil schon 415 ist. Tschhüß!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
