      I've come down with a what I think is a mild case of the blues the last couple of days. The main source of this, I know, is work. When the bosses take vacation, people with vendettas seem to let loose.  Tuesday was the real big blow up between a couple of people. Somehow, I managed to get caught right in the middle. Same thing today. It's also really frustrating that after nearly two months of work, the project I've been working on had a major flaw in it that wasn't expected.  It helps to have someone to talk to, but seems like everyone has someplace better to be tonight. Or someplace happier. That frustrates me more. I don't want to say anything because I don't want them to feel obligated to me because they aren't. I just don't want to be alone either. It really sucks being down like this.  I'm also all mixed up about some feelings I'm having. Just.... wondering why things happen when they do, you know? Why do we always find something that fits our lives only to find there's some major catch to it?  Frustrating......

      May you live all the days of your life.         - Jonathan Swift  My all time favorite quote. It says so simply what I try to do each day. If we all did this, how much more would we get out of life? Would we spend so much time worrying? Would we waste opportunity so liberally? Would we let our friendships slip away so easily? Would we always be so passive in expressing our care to those we love?  There's a lot on my mind of late. I have so much in my life that I've gained new respect for in the last two years. I suppose divorce will do that, but then maybe that's what I needed. Maybe I needed to wake up to the joys and blessings in my life. It's strange to think that something so traumatic could change into something good for you, but I look back, not even a year after my divorce was finalized and I can see how much good the change did for me.  My divorce began n Jan of 2003 and was finalized in Sept of 2003. It's amazing how much has changed since I began the divorce. When things started, I was barely 'treading water' so to speak and barely keeping my head above the water financially and emotionally. Yet the further I got with school, the easier things seemed to get. I could deal with things much easier and stress wasn't a problem. I had things, creative outlets, to pour everything into.  I look at where I am today, with a new job that I love and am doing well at, a degree and a little more financial stability, and I can't help but smile.  I'm on my way. No specific destination aside from providing a good life for my kids. I'm ready to enjoy life, to watch them grow up, to see the  world through their eyes and to show them the joys I remember feeling when I was a kid. There is so much promise in our future.....  What a feeling that is! To know that I've come through such a difficult period of my life and managed to come out of it not only okay, but a stronger person and for the most part, on top of my game. It's amazing. It baffles me, thrills me, excites me, and humbles me. I wish there was a way I could put all of it into words, but words fail miserably. There's nothing that even comes close to explaining how overwhelmed I am with the possibilities now available to me and my kids.  I'm on my way.

      It's strange to me, that friendships are so much like romantic relationships. Before you write me off based on that single statement, let me explain.  I view my friends as precious commodities. They are something to be treasured, but not like those silly little knick knacks your grandmother puts on her shelf. They're more like that favorite toy. You know, the one you took everywhere and couldn't live without.  I've made a couple of friends just in the last couple of months that I can't imagine not having now. I am amazed at just how much more enriched my life seems with them around now. Now, these aren't the casual friends most people have. These are the down and dirty, there for you when you need them no matter when or where, and honest as hell.  They are the kinds of people I can go to with anything, even stuff I wouldn't tell my family. It's strange to think that a friendship can feel as strong to me as the relationship I once had with my ex husband. Stranger still is that often the bond of the friendship seems stronger. I guess I had some image in my head that said that marriage relationships were always the stronger. I'm quickly finding this not to be the case.  I'm finding that friendship is a bond I value more highly than love sometimes. It just seems that the other person is more honest. They seem to understand that it's okay to open up completely. Society seems to instill into us that we should only act a certain way when we're in love. Of course, all of this could be the scorned wife speaking. Love is difficult to discuss when you've been burned pretty harshly and left with two kids to raise. But that's beside the point.  I realized when I was in middle school that I was afraid to make close friends. Why? Two words: Military Brat. You hesitate to make close friends as a brat because you know you'll only be moving in a short while. It just didn't seem worth the effort and investment that friendships required. And as I've heard said, admiting you have a problem is often the first step to recovering.  So, friendships suddenly became a dear thing to me. I could appreciate them in a different light. I think my friends through high school knew that I valued their friendship in a different way. I hope my friends now understand that. I value each and everyone of them for their unique qualities and treasure each one dearly. I treasure their companionship as much as I treasure the smiles or ring of laughter from my kids. A gift far too precious to simply sit on a shelf to be looked at.  Never let a friendship grow dusty. Never let a friendship fade.  Still think I'm crazy for saying a friendship is like a romantic one? If you simply let a romantic relationship stagnate, the friendship eventually dies. You have to work to keep it alive. You have to keep fresh air in the mix, keep things interesting and encourage growth. So many romantic relationships fall by the wayside for lack of effort on the part of the involved parties. Guilty as charged, but never again.

      Yeah, I'm a sucker for great quotes. Here are a few on my long, long list of good ones.   Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome.  - Booker T. Washington  Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.  - Berthold Auerbach  Life is the art of drawing without an eraser.  - John W. Gardner  Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.  - Mark Twain  Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.  - Mark Twain

      Where to begin.....  My name is Heather and I'm a divorced mother of two absolutely wonderful children. I've taken to putting together an online journal of sorts as I've lost many things in life, but found that I've gained nearly as much. This blog will probably end up being a creative outlet for me as I used to dance and found it to be a form of comfort not only physically but spiritually, if you will.  So why choose the name OnyxMyst? Well, first it's a name I use when I attend Renaissance Faires. Second, it implies an impenitrable mist, one next to impossible to see through. I have often found in the last couple of years that my life hs some dark mists around it, and decisions, major decisions, sometimes have to be made when you are completely blind.  The topics of posts on this blog will probably be many and varied, ranging from daily personal rants to old journal entries taken from my personal journals at home, or even an inside look at some of my vaired interests. But then that's what a journal is. :o)
