      So, I go to the bank today during lunch, and while the teller is helping me, she says, "I have to ask, where do you work that you have to wear steel-toed boots?"  I laugh and tell her I'm an engineer at the GM plant down the road and not only do I have to wear steel-toed boots, I also have to wear safety goggles when on the factory floor.  The goggle are prominently displayed on my head as if they were sunglasses.  I then tell her it's really hard to find anything that goes decently with either item.  I became an engineer again why?  I thought it was for the money but I'm not making nearly enough.....

      I don't want this blog to be a personal diary or anything, but I feel like I have to comment on the events of Saturday night.....  First, I have a friend from work, Michelle, along with her boyfriend, Brandt, and his best friend, Bill, out to Ann Arbor with me. Now, for the record, this is the first time I've been out with Michelle outside of work and the first time I've met Brandt and Bill. So, we go out to dinner, and by dinner, I mean drinking as much as possible with a few bites of food thrown in between. After dinner, we go to the restaurant bar and have some shots for dessert. Now that we're good and liquored up, we go home to get my roommate, Luc, before we leave for the bar. Shockingly, we were smart enough to call a cab. While waiting for the cab, Bill &amp; Brandt start showing me a trick where they take an empty beer bottle, drop it, and catch it in between their feet. I love it. I want to try it. Luc, knowing how I am, says, "I wouldn't let her try that, I forsee disaster." Luc's smart. I should've listened to Luc. But since when do I listen to the voice of reason? I immediately grab a bottle and start trying to catch it. It's not working. It hits my feet about 10 times. At this point, Michelle wants to try also, so she goes to grab the bottle off my feet right as I do. Unfortunately for her, I reach it first, grab it, and then manage to slam the thing right above her eye. Almost immediately it begins swelling up. I feel horrible. She runs to the bathroom. We tell Brandt his girlfriend just got hit in the eye. He doesn't really comprehend. I try to console her, Luc tries to console her, Bill tries to console her. Brandt still doesn't get it. Finally, she comes out of the bathroom, he goes up to her and ends up accidentally hitting her in the face, so she hits him back. I start to feel like the situation is completely out of control and wish the cab would come already. Brandt and Michelle are fighting more now. I decide we need more cigarettes so I run next door to buy some. While I'm there I see 24oz Miller Lites which I have to have. I go back home and everyone makes fun of my "impulse buy". I like my impulse buy. At this point, Bill decides he needs to take Michelle and Brandt home. I feel really bad b/c I feel like I scared these new people away too quickly. The cab has STILL not arrived so I say fuck it and tell Luc I'll drive. I grab my "impulse buy" and get in the car.  We drive by Rick's and it has a line. Are you kidding me? There's all of 20 people in town. Rick's just wants to look cool. We go to the parking structure down the street, pull into a spot and get out. Just as we start walking towards the exit, Luc says he sees a cop, and by cop, I mean UofM department of public safety aka rent-a-cops. I hid my bottle behind my leg and the RAC's drive by. We are almost to the exit doorway when the RAC's come up behind us, turn on some flashers and sirens and motion for me to come over to the car. Are you fucking kidding me? I walk over, with the bottle still in hand, b/c by now I know they know I have it. The jack-ass then says, "I assume by the fact that you're trying to hide it that you know alcohol isn't allowed in the parking garage." No shit sherlock. Well, I thought it was allowed outside and I was just hiding it til I got outside to the street. My god. Obviously it doesn't take brains to become a rent-a-cop in Ann Arbor. So then I get the usual questions, "How much have you had to drink tonight" (my response, "A few"), "Did you drive here?" ("of course not"). He then tells me they've been having problems with drinking in this parking structure and gives me a ticket which tells me I have to appear in court. Are you kidding me? The RAC's have nothing better to do than patrol a campus parking structure for people with alcohol. Honestly, I'm sorry for your life.  We went to the bar after that, but I was really too mad to have any fun. Plus it was like after 1am by this point. The only good thing that happened was on the way back to the car, I found the bottle that the cops had dumped out. A sovenier from the night, so to speak. I just have one question, Does this shit happen to other people?

      Now, I am no fire marshall, but I'd like to think I understand the basics of what causes fires.  That's why I can't fathom why the workers in this factory are allowed to smoke ON THE FACTORY FLOOR.  I mean, are you kidding me?  These machines are covered in oil and grease (I should know, I am writing them a book on what grease to use on what machine... and no, I'm not kidding), yet these workers are allowed to smoke ANYWHERE they please out on the floor.  I don't get it.  This place smells more like tobacco than Philip Morris where they actually produce cigarettes...... but Philip Morris makes their workers go outside to smoke.  Now, does anyone else find this disturbing?  Philip Morris, the largest cigarette manufacturer in the world, the company that gives their employees FREE cigarettes, encourages becoming addicted to their product, and even lets people smoke in their offices; doesn't let their employees smoke on the factory floor.  Yet, GM does.  Scary.

      I actually wrote this in an email to Kat earlier today:  "I think you should play fantasy football though, it is fucking awesome. I can't WAIT to start my team!!!! "  Maybe one of these days I will get a life......  But, in the meantime, FOOTBALL SEASON IS ALMOST HERE!!!!

      One of the most common things people tell me is something along the lines of, "You're the most unlikely engineer I know" or just plain laughter when I tell them what my job is, followed by, "No, what do you REALLY do?". Now, most people would be upset by this. Not me. I'm glad people can't believe I'm an engineer. I mean, I look at my boss, who can barely hold a normal conversation, and looks like the pimply, glasses-wearing nerd from college but with gray hair and a bigger belly, and I think, what the hell am I doing?  And people wonder why I can't find a boyfriend....

      Note to self: Going out til 2am and getting drunk is  probably  not the best idea when you have to work at 6:30am the next morning....... Maybe one of these days I'll learn that I'm no longer in college.  Or maybe not....
