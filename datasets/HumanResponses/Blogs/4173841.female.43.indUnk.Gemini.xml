      before Gito was shot last week I was standing in a queue waiting to pay for subversive literature when the instore radio played an ad so loud it went right through me I could hear how  much the actor was paid to say the words because he didn’t breathe once in the whole 45 seconds it was a lot especially in comparison to most people’s money  the ad was encouraging me  to SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH MY FAMILY THIS WEEKED I listened because that is what I felt like if you felt me you would know all I needed to do was  BUY THE VIETNAM WAR PC GAME  and play it WITH MY LOVED ONES THIS WEEKEND VERY LOUDLY  with spit flying out of the corners of his mouth and  THEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALRIGHT like Jesus Christ Superstar  started puking in the C N A one day last week  because it smelled like napalm and I can’t stand that smell in the morning disgusting bits, blood, body pieces, came flying out of my mouth, with gob, you could smell the green bile from halfway across the mall pieces of wet vomit made like a projectile, stuck on the plastic stationery oozed down page-a-day diary covers, derms and offal the passion of Christ had nothing on this filth that flowed, out my every orifice, until the C N A succumbed  to my own intensely private chainstore massacre  shook my head found my balance paid for the Noseweek thanked God for my friends and family left the C N A suffocating with snot stood on its head pressed down hard before I left

      1. Savings fathers' Life x 3 times at 2am in the morning over three months.  2. Mother threatens to hit father with knobkerrie (South Africanese for Zulu cultural weapon) and runs away to unknown destination for one night during which I manage to embarass the entire family in desperate search. Quite proud of parents' passion afterwards considering their age and physical condition. Mother approached to explain why she has never apologised to me in whole life. Answer (to be expected) "Because I am always right."  3. Doctors get hold of lover's father and operate endlessly for no (all intense and) purpose other than to inflict misery on sweet man. God get's hold of lover's father who is buried with love and sadness and without great collection of stamps and coins which have all been sold to defray.  4. Own father not breathing so well and smoking like chimney  5. Lover's mother-in-law rises from bedridden status (2 years long) to drive car, only to be struck down by unknown forces and then, after recovering from serious medication addiction (as a result of a decision to leave her finally to be with just a morphine patch and love for comfort) opens death's door to walk back into world but immediately finds herself with minus one leg and therefore inability to walk and no gees (soft 'g' - South Africanese for 'heart' or 'spirit') anyway.   6. Earning less than have in many years as a result of being over ambitious and seriously fucked over by government department responsible for developing small business who I should have known better (I did know better) are not capable of same.  7. Phone cut off.  8. Water and lights not cut off God knows why.   9. Oh. Lights cut off anyway often because neighbourhood transformer suffering from neurosis and everytime this happens it's when I am bleeding like there will never be a menopause and freezing cold and want my bath, my hot bath, my hot bath, my solace. Also, everytime it happens we have to phone to check it's the whole neighbourhood in case my neurosis is real and we have actually been cut off because the bill looks like old biltong with green growth.  10. Magician Housekeepers Brilliant Mother Dies. She had a great life but the sadness is deep sad.  11. Great friend musician dies of murder. Great friend musician's wife leaves for An Other Country. No comfort.  12. Child requires promised most expensive addictive toy and no way of backing out without appearing completely treacherous so buy on tick and get black mark.  13. Immediate work superior behaves like Most Important Bully On Block on Daily Basis. She does not have a moustache but you can only tell by looking at her.  14. Nobody cares so new puppy constantly gets out and races cars along main road. Gets inevitable hit. Operation. Survives. More moolah required. Thank God our vet is powerfully reminscent of childhood sweetheart so at least get to flirt in the midst of mania.  15. Electric gate has nervous breakdown. Area bad so have to fix or get mauled at front door. Fix. Big - very big - bucks. Week later, wake up at 5am to see three men at bottom gate (open) in dark, talking. Think it's our friends - the guys who live at bottom of our garden in The New Improved South Africa so wave and go back to sleep. They are young. We think they must have been partying. One even waves back. In daylight it becomes obvious gate motor has been stolen by deserving fiends. Fix again quick. This time fix so can't be stolen. Why didn't we do that in first place? Can't answer that. Next: Week later, big truck arrives to fetch rubble and reverses out of gate straight into intercom system. Breaks. No money left to fix. Son sings Gladness costs you not a thing and he who is happy is a king. So we sing loud here in the inner city and stick a sign on the intercom next to the fancy electronic gate to say phone us when you get here. Only phone is still cut off so if you don't have cell no, you have to leave.  16. Memory fails. Shit flies. Amnesia a blessing.  17. Funny how you can love your life. I went to visit my boba and she asked me how's it going. I said "Boba I am praying for the Messiah". She said I should start by putting out that cigarette.  I love Pablo Neruda - "love is short, forgetting is long". Goodnight Sweet Netwit

      The 12th of August. I decided that seeing as how it is currently obvious that shit is flying in my direction, it would seem most appropriate to accept the fact instead of freaking out at the mess. Therefore I defy the universe: let it fly! I am not going to behave as if I'm the one living in a urinal. Nor am I of the opinion that I am guilty of some strange karmic manipulation that has purposefully attracted this chaotic compostic. Fuck that. Nevertheless, I am prepared to take 100% responsibility for the outcome so have decided to wrap myself in plastic. Hence the latest pseudonym - Ms Cling Foil. Aka The GladWrap. No shit on my skin. No smell up my nose. No matter how much sewerage. Bit challenging to breathe I must admit but at least I'm transparent. I fight with love and laughing.

       I come from a long line of people we escaped into the desert we wandered for forty years we were looking for a promised land  we got commandments we broke we got manna from heaven we ate we got the land of milk and honey we’ve been fighting over it ever since maybe our mom was not at home so much  there is blood in the mud in my Jerusalem my Joburg where Gito died like Israel some mother’s child someone’s boy maybe two kids they were not the pharaohs maybe brothers it was not Goliath maybe there were three and maybe they weren’t such kids maybe they were older they could have been the philistines someone or more than one someone sure was their mother maybe she was not home so much maybe she was not enough  they shot Gito no one knows what happened but we all know they cut us to the quick blood flowed from our neck the sound of it was not like a fountain or Gito chanting it was the sound of Gito’s lover, screaming she is the one who wants to think about justice so I think about Gito’s mom because she is also someone’s mother she is the mother of the shot child shot by the son of another mother who was not at home or enough  Jerusalem is everywhere you go down President Street Gito knew that and he knew we all know the arbitrary mayhem intelligence officials use those sharp pointer spikes to finger terror three days after they shot Gito one more shot was fired close to our house and Rosie said she saw police cars and someone else got shot but we don’t know him if it was a man If we did we would have heard about it by now  some people get shot and just lie there and noone comes. Not even anyone’s lover and noone’s mother. someone else gets it in the neck and the world mourns stricken, while the lone body lies there still, loved ones surround some other spirit. Arbitrary mayhem. Arbitrary love.  Gito was shot everyone is crying and making soup people come from everywhere they are phoning and we are trying to find them in the dream your legs can’t move when it’s your time Erika wants to think about justice but I lost my confidence I will drive up and down President Street Jerusalem late at night looking for my promised land, eating my manna, breaking my commandments but I can’t also be expected to speak crevices in my character where terror creeps in to stop my tongue from turning we can’t hold our faces straight Before Gito died it felt like everything was ok because we weren’t lying in the street shot in the neck dead and waiting for someone’s mother to come but she was not at home  AND WHERE IS THEIR DAD?

      We are having smoked salmon in times of hardship and famine. This is our way of defying the water and lights bills. My life is not really a series of one-liners. We have so much death and destruction around us, you need to have a quip with you wherever you go. Hey I love my city. We live in a house with no burglar proof and a view so fuck you if you think you can use this to justify your fear.

       There's an alarm going off in the house on the hill. It is not a very loud alarm but it has that madness to it that comes with never having heard the sound before and it's half past 8 and it suddenty went off. And we don't have an alarm. Unlike most of the rest of the nation who have laptops to blog around in bed with. Was that a split infinitive? Do you know how many times I have been shown how to avoid splitting infinitives? About the same too many times as I have forgotten. The alarm has stopped. As I wrote that it just stopped, like it began. Joburg has its maniacal moments. Often. I'm sure there are peaceful spots but having lived here all my life, never having left for more than six weeks, ever, (can you sense the self-pity?), I am reasonably sure that they are not close by. The mayhem is so normal now you just keep on typing. Hurtling slowly through Africa.
