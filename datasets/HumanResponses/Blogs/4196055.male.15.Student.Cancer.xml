      Well let's see, monday sucked as I said, the rest of the week sucked until Friday. Ira came over and we watched movies and shit all night. Hmmmm today I went to the movies with a few people. I didn't talk much to anyone, kind of sucked because I felt pretty left out, travis had sam, sam had his brother, and travis h was with rachel, and then there was me... so yeah. I think I made things right with Steph finally. This day has gone on the list as mediocre in general. No matter how much I did I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something. God I feel so depressed right now, I really want to talk to someone but no one's on... whatever goodnight.

      Well today started off shitty, I went to the auditorium since I had no first period. She finally got to me and sean at the end of the period, and when I went into her office she told me to go back to the auditorium. I went to chem it was alright, had no 3rd so I went back to the auditorium. This time I really didn't feel like not having a class so I waited at the door and was in the second group to go. I had to call my parents about whether I wanted to drop band or drop german. This is where my day started to fucking blow huge mother fucking ass. So I'm forced out of band and into fucking WELLNESS. WHAT - THE - FUCK. So then I get my new schedule and I have Algebra II and Chemistry 1st and 2nd period oh joy. I go to fourth which is study hall and had an alright time with Will and Connor. Go to lunch and have my money stolen by two different coke machines. By now I'm in "Fuck this lame ass school" mode. I then get to spend my whole lunch period wandering around because everyone wants to eat somewhere different, I guess my whole anti-social side had a part in me wanting to eat somewhere no one else was eating I think tomorrow I'm just going to "disappear" at lunch, I really don't feel like talking to alot of those people who don't understand me and won't back off when they can see I'm pissed. After lunch the rest of the day was fine had 2 hours in world studies then German and got on the bus to go home. Bus was fine got home talked to my mom for an hour about alot of things, school, drugs, my siblings ect. After dinner I went to apply at the library and was rejected so right now I'm sitting down here writing the stupid thing about how much my day sucked balls and how much this school year is going to suck. So umm yeah... today sucked, tomorrow's going to suck and chances are the day after that is going to suck.

      I know my last post said I was depressed, don't get me wrong, I'm still depressed but you can have good days and be depressed too. Today was pretty cool, I got to go to andrew's party with ira which was pretty fun, a bit awkward at times around steph, and a bit boring in the beginning. After that we went to ira's where I actually learned how to stand on a skateboard, note I still suck ass but I got better. Oh and if you're this far into reading the Say It Ain't So midi has started, please don't hate it's a keyboard portrayal of the song I think it's pretty good for having none of the actual instruments. Anyways I can skate down a portion of ira's walkway and I can stay on, start off, and finish alright with the minor mistakes such as fucking up a stop and basically landing on my foot backwards my left knee hurts a bit right now but w/e I'll get over it. It's 2:30 so I'm going to bed or something, later to all my readers (like 2 or 3 tops).  Edit: I changed the song to the zephyr song because it's alot more depressed then the midi version of say it ain't so and depressed is my mood of choice of the current time. P.S. Lyric of the Moment: Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me)Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering)Cutting up my words before I speak (Cutting up my words) This is how it feels to not believe Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (feels to be alone and not believe)Feels to be alone and not believe anything. Band: Yellowcard Song: Way Away.

      Yeah... I'm starting to get depressed again. You may notice all the emo lyrics in my away messages... yeah. If I don't talk to some people at school this year it's because you really fucking got on my nerves last year, so if anyone's reading this they can inform them. I've decided it's time to stop being something I hate and start being myself for once.This includes not hiding it when I get pissed off at someone, I'm tired of sitting there and taking the shit shoveled at me. Call me an asshole all you want, I really don't care anymore, I'm depressed right now, no it has nothing to do with me breaking up with stephanie, it's deeper then that, like a cut that can't quite heal, except it's deep down inside. So to all the people I've ever hated,  F    U    C    K        Y    O    U

      Yesterday was the same as the day before... woke up got out of bed (no im not writing the lyrics to A Day in the Life) ahhhh Andrew's party is tomorrow and I don't know if anyone is even going. Anyways today started off the same as every day except for the fact I set my alarm to ten. Yeah.. why else would I be writing this at 10:30? I've still got my english and german homework to do I should probably start that today... later anyone who actually reads this.  Lyric of the Moment: So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away So let me slip against the current So let me slip away.  Song: Vindicated Band: Dashboard Confessional. (Yes Dashboard does suck but I happen to like this part of this song.)

      Ira has this in his blog so I decided to post some pictures too. First one is The Strokes   Hmmmm A-F   Stereophonics, brit band kinda like a mix between the strokes and incubus.   This one speaks for itself.   Hard enough finding a picture of him without a joint in his mouth.    More to come when I feel like... adding... more.

      Let's see... I woke up about 2 because some cock waffle wouldn't stop calling my house... got on msn talked to rose for a while then went and took a shower and fucked around until dinner. Dinner sucked as usual, any time i spend with my family sucks. Came downstairs and fucked around some more listened to music talked to people on aim talked to people on msn yadda yadda it's 12 am now and i spent my whole day talking to people, how socially productive.  Lyric of the moment: "Now I'm lyin' on the table with everything you said it will, all catch eventually, will it caught up, and honestly, the weight of my decisions were impossible to hooold, but they were never(they were never) they were never yours!" -Band: Taking Back Sunday; Song: I Know you Know
