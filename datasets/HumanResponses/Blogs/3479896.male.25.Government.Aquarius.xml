						   Friday 28th May 2004 hi there everyone, this is the first time i'm writing this, well it's Friday here in the UK and it's an extended weekend as it's a bank holiday on Monday.  Very busy at work, meeting Clients, meetings with Ministers, colleagues and managers.  Bit fed up in my current location, it's a small office in Greater Manchester and just haven't seem to settled in.  I have to say some people are great whilst others....  So it's a long weekend, painting the small room at home and then maybe spending time with my wife and newly born baby, i have to say i saw the British National Party's election broadcast, it was a load of s****.  It was full of inconsistencies and falsehoods, it spread hatred and racial diffences when we should be celebrating our different diversities.  We need to vote on June 10th to keep them out.  Celebrate our different cultures and beliefs, speak soon, have a good weekend all.

						   Well it's the weekend again, it's only been a four day week but so glad it's friday.  Well i'm attending the Sunni Seal of Prophethood International Conference in Birmingham on Sunday.  It's a conference about Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) as the seal of the Prophets.  We in the Sunni group believe there will be no prophet after him and that he is the seal of prophet, anyone claiming to be a prophet is a imposter and liar.  Over 200 Muslim scholars will be there, can't wait.  Work is great, I'm on a Management Development programme in Work and have been chatting to my Mentor, she's quite high up in the Orgnanisation and i'm looking forward to her help, support and friendship.  The hard work now starts!!!!  That's it really for now, will post my comments on Tuesday as i'm in meetings all day on Monday, have a good weekend

						   Back to work  I've come back to work today after the bank holiday, for those of you outside the UK this our spring holiday when we have an extra Monday off.  So where do I start; my wife and beautiful daughter have gone to stay with her brother for a few weeks, empty house and peace and quiet!!!!  Have been busy putting posters up for our memorial event for our father who passed away 15 years ago; it's a Muslim religious event to remember him and the great Muslim saint Hazrat Khawaja Zindapeer (May Allah be please with him).  It's happening on Saturday 12th June 2004 in Rochdale, see my website for more details on www.mohammedshafiq.org.uk  Work is great at the moment, got a couple of new jobs lined up, will let you know the outcome soon.  I have to say something very important, the elections on June 10th are a great opportunity for those of you like me who opposed the illegal war in Iraq and the continued illegal occupation to give the sitting Government a bloody nose; a vote for Labour is a vote for their action in Iraq, please vote for Liberal Democrat candidates as they were the only mainstream party to oppose war and continued questions on Iraq are still been asked by Charles Kennedy and his team, vote for Lib Dems in local, European and London Mayoral elections, thats Simon Hughes MP in London, the best man for the job of Mayor, a vote for Ken Livingstone is a vote for an illegal war in Iraq, do not be deceived by Ken's insistence that he opposed war and that a vote for Labour is a vote of confidence in Blair actions in Iraq.  My colleagues in America please vote for John Kerry to oust Mr Bush, he is so out of touch with reality.  More on this soon.

						   It’s super Thursday, when millions of people in the UK have the opportunity to vote in local Council, European Parliament, London Mayoral and Assembly elections.  Today you have an opportunity to register your anger at the situation in Iraq, please vote for the Liberal Democrats.  No post over the weekend as it’s the grand conference in Rochdale, for further details check out my website on www.mohammedshafiq.org.uk

						   Hi there, where do I start, it’s quite cloudy and windy in Manchester, suppose we will get some rain.  The weather or lack of sun is the only thing that gets me down in Manchester.  Been successful in getting an interview for a Team Leader job at work, it’s this afternoon, not enough time to plan for the interview as I was told only yesterday afternoon, will have to wait and see how I get on.

						   HELLO  It's seems like ages since i put anything online for you to read, let me begin by apologises, it's been very hectic at work and home.  Hope you are all well and that wherever you are the weather is better than here, it's so not right having so much rain, cloudy, feels like autumn!!! and it's bloody July. In my local community we have a massive problems of the prostitutes hanging around on our streets for business, this has brought kerb crawlers, pimps, drug dealers, drug users into our community.  Old age pensioners, our mothers and sisters are unable to walk on the streets alone any more and a mad sex attacker is playing cat and mouse with the Police.  We in the community have taken it upon ourselves to clear the prostitutes and kerb crawlers off our streets.  For the past five days we have marched into the red light district and pushed the prostitutes and their pimps off the streets, we've threatened to take action against kerb crawlers and are working with the community to clean up our streets.  Recently 2 Ladies were beaten up by the pimps and the Police took 6 hours to arrive, last night when a prostitute was pushed they arrived in 2 minutes, i kid you not this is what is happening!!!  Direct Action to clear our community is the only option left to us and we will do whatever is necessary.   On the work front I am pleased to announce I have just recently been appointed the Jobcentreplus North West Regional Diversity and Equality Officer, despite the stiff competition I pulled it off and can't wait to start the new job.  look froward to hearing from you all soon.  Have a great weekend

						    Hi there, it has been an eventful weekend, it was my niece’s birthday on Saturday so a full family get together, really enjoyed spending time with the family.  Then it was laying about on Sunday.  My interview on Friday for the Diversity and Equality Officer went well, I started bad, as I was confused as to what the question was about, but I did ask her about it at the end and she said she had sufficient answer to cover her concern.  Should find out this week.

						   What have I done to deserve some sun!!!!  Well where do I start, yesterday the Chancellor (British finance Minister) announced his spending plans for the next four years.  In it he increases Health, education and Home Office Budgets, which I welcome.  After many years of under investment in our vital public services the extra resources are welcomed.  He also announced 100 000 Civil Service job cuts, the proof of this is in the pudding.  It’s not an additional 100 000 announced on top of the 40 000 already announced in our department the DWP.  It’s on top of them.  It makes me really angry when politicians just recklessly announce these job cuts when those of us in the Civil Service are working so hard to deliver better Public Services for our customers, whether it be a benefit customer, someone looking for work using the Jobcentreplus service or a person claiming tax Credits from the Inland Revenue.  The vast majority of Civil Servants work with customers face to face; you cannot increase the workload of staff and then cut their numbers.  It does not make sense.  We are very happy to make efficiency savings and recognise there will obviously be some job cuts as a result of newer IT equipment, they will have to make the systems work before cutting staff, as the Government does not have a good record on computer systems delivery.
