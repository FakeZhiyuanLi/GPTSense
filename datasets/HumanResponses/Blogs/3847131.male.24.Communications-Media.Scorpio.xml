      Sometimes we have to give an answer or make a move under pressure. One thing i've tried to do lately is learn to relax. Don't let myself be forced into doing anything. Usually when we do such things we either make ourselves look bad, let ourselves down, or just plain make stupid mistakes. Things can always be put on hold, we are all only human!

      The blog you are reading is in no way, shape or form associated directly with the life of Gray, however all bits of advice, information and happenings are remotely influenced by daily occurances and observations relating to and about the life of Gray. That is all.

      Understand that if things come easy, or happen too fast, its only a matter of time before they end too quickly, or end before you want them too. Good things take time, but far less thinking. I find it funny how I worry about someones feelings when they say they like me so much after only knowing me for a short while. I should realize that first impressions may be good, but they are only first impressions. Easy come easy go. Women can change their thoughts and feelings from one day to the next.

      I think I just realized what a blog is for. Its cathartic for the soul, it gets things off your chest. I type a lot...I delete it later. I'll keep this short. I hate to hurt people, the last thing I ever want to do is look into the crying eyes of a sweet, nice, and innocent girl and know that I was the cause of the tears. Its the worst feeling in the world. I can't say that I've been a good guy. Even though, every day I try to be the best guy I can be. I never want to hurt people, I never do anything if my feelings are in it... Can things be really bad if it was a never was? Apparently so. I've seen lots of girls cry. &nbsp; So what have I learned. Well, there is no such thing as a nice guy, thats for sure, and no matter how good of a person you ever will try to be, you'll always end up hurting someone. And no matter how much trust you put in people or someone you care about someday...someday your trust will be broken.

      Being tired is like feeling pain.  Sleeping takes time, so does everything else.

      Punky Brewster, breast reduction, still a pantene girl.  Britney Spears, breast enlargement, pantene girl? Never.  In case you are wondering, I only mentioned britney spears because she gets a million hits a day on google. So now all I have to do is sit back and wait. Ohhh yeah, I can feel them rolling in already.

      I was suprised to hear that not many people know what a pantene girl is. When someone asks me if I have a type, I usually say I want a pantene girl.  So for anyone that doesnt know what a pantene girl is, its something completely and utterly superficial, and granted I don't limit myself to just pantene girls, but if I were ever to think of marriage...Pantene girl all the way baby!  Long shiney straight dark dark hair. Granted, some pantene girls are the fairest of the fair, but only a lucky few can be considered a pantene girl. Dark, arched, long eyebrows, olive shaped deep dark eyes, long slender nose, and a smile that has the top lip squeezing into the high cheek bones.  Yup..like that pantene.

      Often I hear the question, "Are you serious?"  Today I have a response.  No. No I am not.  You just got citric acid in my eye. You'll pay for that.

      If everything were a sure thing, would life be so exciting?  Girls don't know what they want.  Women know what they want - but won't tell you.  And so it begins.

      If you fart in a forest and no one is around to hear it, is it still funny?  Yes. Yes it is.

       Well. I've made 2048.00 to date for my class. And I continue to work hard when I can to sell these calendars. If you are interested in buying a beautiful 2005 calendar featuring paintings of vancouver, check out  urlLink http://www.idea05.ca/  for more information and to see the paintings.      I'm having a good summer. I've finished my internship, it went great, I learned so much. I've been spending some time with this great girl who i will miss very much when she goes back home. But things have been great.   I am contemplating on what other projects I will set for myself to keep myself busy before going back to school in sept. I do believe a new website for my own personal enjoyment is on its way...

      On my mind... Crazy psycho bitch  still harassing - time to forget about that crap and enjoy my last month of summer. My girl from mexico - things are going well, 2 weeks left with her before she goes back. Sick of calendars, deciding not to care anymore, after this week - NO more calendars for me. Almost finished great internship at an advertising agency, it was a good experience. What a good bbq. Had a nice long weekend. Ran into an old friend, heard from another on the phone, and heard about another from the one on the phone. Has got me thinking, wow what a crazy life. Time goes by so fast.

      Okay. So I had to jump on the neighbours trampoline today. It made me feel a bit better. Why is it so hard to jump on the ground afterwards? Bizarre. Happiness...well, I've decided once again to not concern myself with the little things. I take a look at the big picture and realize whats important. Other people's BS? Wow, why is that my concern...I really should stop worrying about other peoples problems - let them sort it out for a change and keep it far far away from me. It doesnt matter if people hate you for what you do and how you act and what you choose. What they think is so wrong from what your friends think, and if thats so, then you must be doing something right. So who cares what someone who "thinks" they know you says or thinks about you. Sometimes its good to be selfish, afterall, it seems many people are this way...and worrying more about yourself and well being sometimes provides a little satisfaction. You can't say all that you try to do these days goes noticed, and is appreciated. So do more things for yourself.  Pretty soon, when you try to do things that make you happy, and you make attempts to enjoy every moment since they all can't last for ever, from my experience you can gain a little peace of mind.  Even after all I've said, all that I've thought, everything I've learned...no matter how bad it is, I always wish for more time. And less time to dwell on crap, more time to enjoy. Happiness, satisfaction and some peace of mind. Relax!
