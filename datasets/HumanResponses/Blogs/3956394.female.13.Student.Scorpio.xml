       As the days approch..Thinking about high school gets scarier.VERY freaky.What classes will i go to? Will i find my way around? What if i cant turn the dial thing on my locker? =P I dont know but im going to have to find out sooner or later.At least my next door neighbores go to the same high school as me so they can help me (Ones 1 year older then me and the other is 2) I hope im going to be in my friends classes.I will DIE without being in one class without at least one friend... And maybe a cute guy too =) Hehehe jk.I know i cant be stuffed in a locker because the teachers said we dont fit =P (We took a tour around the whole school before elementary school ended) But the lockers are big enough for all our school stuff.oOo And the main thing im wondering about... Does our school supply list and info come in the mail or what? Agth, at Elementary school they didnt give us too much information about this.. they think the kids can predict the furture or something.Walking past my elem. school to go to my high school will seem very very odd for me.Concidering my elem. school and high school are right next to eachother.. Infact, seperated only by 1 gate! =) Check out the gym for the high school.. P.E Will be fun.Same with drawma.My drawma teacher looks like Albert Instien or whatever =P White poofy hair.. freaky.The cafateria food is good.We tasted some when we took the tour.The schools big so i know im going to have trouble getting around =P In fact, the washrooms are clean too XD Very nice.The problem is the ppl... they all look freaky too me.VERY freaky.No one my size except one kid thats prob 2 cm smaller then me so called smurf.Anyways, im off now.Ill leave my thoughts like this...

        If you didnt know, i have another life outside of my home =) That would be my school "life". Why life? Because my school and home are 2 diffrent lives for me.Too make it better - Im going to high school so i can be expecting tons of diffrent things to happen and... >=)  ...Get this - My sister wont be going to high school for another 2 years so even better for me too have a diffrent life at school.  What I'll be writting on my school blog is -  Things that happen ONLY in school and have to do ONLY with school and what i think will happen to me IN school.You get the point - In school only.So, on my other blog ill write about home, friends, family, and just things that are OUTSIDE of school (Hehehe, sorry witht the caps lock there) So go to my other blog to see my school life?  To get to my blog that tells about my home life , go to my profile, go to the very bottem, and you will see a list of blogs.There will be two, one named school life and another blog named Life Starts Here.Click on life starts here.

       YES! 3 More days till i get to sleep in my own bed and see Nicole,Rebecca and my mom Maria.Im really happy (My matress on my bed is very bouncy and comfy thank you very much) Im going to miss these last days.I have about $4 left so today and tomorrow im getting a slupree..And i think im going to get cookies today too.Hehehe =D I might go alone concidering that Denise probably wont come.What about Cristine? Ah, she would make me buy her something in order to come.Of course im going to miss being yelled at, but that'll happen at home to so everythings cool.We havent been to a chinese restaurant in a while so my mom promised well go when we get home =) Like a coming home present thing i guess.In my other blog i already wrote what im going to miss but im going to be SO happy when i see Rebecca and my mom.And OF COURSE my baby sis Nicole =D (Nicki) She can almost walk now and i miss her a ton.She likes soft popcorn, which is odd since i just found out.I cant forget about my friends either.I cant wait to see them and hang out with them! For 1 month not seeing them is long for me =D oOo And the water park right beside my house.ITS SO HOT! I cant wait to cool down.Well time to go for me.My times up on the PC. See ya! =)

       I am i getting headachesbeacuse of how im trying not to be yelled at every day or is it normal? Well im thinking more then usual and trying things ive never done so i can say that im not sure about these headaches.What should i keep my mind focused on? Trying to be a goody goody and not get in trouble or trying to get home (Still at my cousins) and have some fun with my other friends? Im SO comfussed and i have no clue how to solve it.Since im having days were im friends with my cousins and days when we hate eachother, today is a friend day.Yesterday wasnt.. and probably tomorrow wont be =P I would concider it a pattern.But right now, i cant focus on that.I have to focus on thinking about what to focus on >.

      I find it really odd that people go write about someone.Not just anyone someone, but me.This "person" goes on blogger, writes about me, and yet knows that i read her blogs.Does she seriosly TRY to hurt me that bad? Well if she writes about me why cant i write about her? Lets see: shes always yelling at me for no reason, when i try to do something nice she tells me not to do it,and she treats me like crap comepare to other people.YES, it does hurt me inside and she may or not know it, but it does.Cant she think about my postition for one time? I mean, right now i can be with my best friend playing for crying out loud, having the best time of my life. =( I did shed some tears today and i probobly will shed more, but why should i? she doesnt care anyway...

      Heehehe.Red faced freak XD Thats me.I went swimming AGAIN today and i got a surprise today.A burning red face.Heh, reder and reder it will get very soon.WILL THE BURNING EVER END! As one my friends quoted.I responded no.Today, one i got to the pool we had pushing fights and pushed eachother into the water.Luckly, the life guard didnt see half the times we did push one another =P  (You can get kicked out for pushing other people) After pushing and swimming, we had the first break.Me and 2 other friends went to get chips,cookies, and gum from superstore which is located 2 mins away from the pool.I got the best gum EVER. (Im a gum freak person.I can chew one pack of gum a day.I love gum.Love.Gum.You get it.) So when we came back it was swimming time again.This time we were trying to splash old people by jumping off the edge and landing right beside them in the water.We had fun trying to get the oldest lady in the world wet.She was a hard one man.She didnt wanna get her precious "Sunglasses" wet.After we got ppl wet, we bugged the life guards by asking them how much they get payed an hour. =) A few actually responded.It was break time again and we ATE.We were starving.After it was swimming time AGAIN.We had races and splashed and everything else you would do in the water.After we all decided it was time to go home.We were very tired from swimming so long.I walked home in a happy mood knowing that this is how my summer is suposed to be.Once again, the only bad thing was the tan >.     Sunscreen.

I met new people and had tons of fun.I got flipped over like 5 million times by people and it was SOO cool.The only bad thing was getting a tan on my face =P It got a little red but the redness is going away...its funny.I scrunch up my nose and i get a little tingly feeling in my eyebrow cause of the tan! Hehehe.As long as mt face doesnt peel  o_O  Very scary.I wanna get my back tanned.Im scared ill fall asleep in the sun XD My sister did.. Hahaha.Red back.Cute.Hey... how come some ppls backs and fronts go a nice golden tan but so go red =P For example, my moms front and back is so red that it can blind you.But my back and front goes tanned. (Except my face.My face needs sunscreen.) Well.I cant wait to go swimming tomorrow with my friends.I know its gonna be another fun day.Today i didnt get to go though cause of my mom..

       What i mean by fire, (tittle of this entery) is the fire is heat.And the heat is seriosly killing me and my friends today.. What do i mean by water? Well i went swimming today already in 2 very diffrent locations and now im about to go swimming near my old house with a diffrent friend =P Believe me, none of us can stand the heat... i mean, major Tan!! Luckly, i dont want to get a tan so im going to a inside pool with my friend.Newton Wave Pool.Its crazy there! Crashing waves of cold water and water slide races.... ahhh, my summer is finally settling in.Although the part that everyone one is walking around in their bathing suits, bras and underwear... it is a little strange =P I mean, i dont really blame them though.If someone stayed out a whole day they'd be black >.  Sleeping with my sheets off is rare.I usually dont get that hot that fast but last night it did >.

       I found this rather interesting:   La Prensa Hispanoamericana Mayo 20, 2004 pg 17      Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May and still smelled pretty good by June. However, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the Body odour (BO). Baths equaled a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other sons and men, thenthe women and finally the children; last of all the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually loose someone in it. Hence the saying, "Don't throw the baby out with the bath water".        Houses had thatched roofs. Thick straw, piled high, with no wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all the pets...dogs, cats and other small animals, mice, rats, bugs lived in the roof. When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof. Hence the saying, "It's raining cats and dogs." There was nothing to stop thigns from falilng into the house. This posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could really mess up your nice clean bed. So, they found if they made beds with big posts and hung a sheet over the top, it addressed that problem; hence those beautiful big 4 poster beds with canopies.       The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt, hence the saying "dirt poor." The wealthy had slate floors which would get slippery in the witner when wet. So they spread thresh on the floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on they kept adding more thresh until when you opened the door it would all start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed at the entry way, hence a "threshhold"       They cooked in the kitchen in a big kettle that always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot. They mostly ate vegetables and didn't get much meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes the stew had food in it that had been in there for a month. Hence the rhyme: pea's porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old." Sometimes they could obtain pork and would feel really special when that happened.       When company came over, they would bring out some bacon and hang it to show it off. It was a sign of wealth and that a man "could really bring home the bacon. " They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and "chew the fat." Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with a high acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food. This happened most often with tomatoes, so they stopped eating tomatoes... for 400 years.       Most people didn't have pewter plates, but had trenchers- a piece of wood with the middle scooped out like a bowl. Trenchers were never washed and a lot of times worms got into the wood. After eating off wormy trenchers, they would get "trench mouth." Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the top, or the "upper crust".       Lead cups were used to drink ale or whiskey. The combination would sometimes knock them out for a couple of days. Someone walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see  if they would wake up. Hence the custom of holding a "wake".       England is old and small and they started running out of places to bury people. So, they would dig up coffins and would take their bones to a house and re-use the grave. In reopening these coffrins, one out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So they thought they would tie a string on their wrist and lead it through the coffin and up though the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night to listen for the bell. Hence on the "graveyard shift" they would know that someone was "saved by the bell" or he was a "dead ringer"

       If your a girl, then i just wanted to say that your guy will never be a "match".Why? Hes not going to like EVERYTHING that you like, hes not going to be with you EVERYTIME you want him to be and your not going to find your PERFECT match in one day.What about if he kisses you? Emails you? Makes you happy? Well think about this.What does a kiss mean? A peck of slobber on your face or lips? Thats why parents dont want you going out and being with someone.They are scared of you being hurt or they know you chose the wrong guy.After your parents tell you to dump the wrong guy, why would you look for another? Do you really think your parents are going to approve of him after you just went out with a punk or goth? Well, all im trying to say is dont except your perfect guy to arrive in 1 day.Wait months, maybe even years.Maybe even when your 42, thats when he'll come along.What i think would be the best guy for you is a guy of your religion or language.This is for the girl .. and you know who you are.And i dont care if you think that what i wrote is crap.You think its crap because you didnt think about it..

       The days are approching so Cristine (My sister) ,Michelle (A friend) and I went to go get school stuff.We went to superstore having s good long walk and convo.While we were looking on the list, cristine ran to get the items.I told her not to get the too expensive stuff and guess what? Our bill turned out at $63.94 dollars.Oh how mad i was that she picked out everything expensive... I was ebaressed to tell the lady we had to much items and to take some out but i had to.I told my mom what happened and now shes is finally in trouble.Its not only the money thing that made me mad though.It was that I would pick some stuff out and yet she would yell to me that i picked out the wrong thing.I wanted to send her home then and there even though we were shopping for her.Even the littlest things can get you mad, she said.Well i think SHE is the one who should calm down.Right now i have the worst headache ever.. >.<>Im just warning you guys:  One thing thats ticks me off is what i just wrote.If you want to be on my good list, PLEASE dont EVER yell at me (Esepecally if im older then you) and dont ever get between me and my sisters fights unless YOU want to be the one beat up.

       At home for my 3d night (Or second, lost track because of the best days ive had recentaly) So as i was going to bed yesterday, i tucked myself in slowly.Why? Because of the feeling of my warm matress awaited me.My nice covers when over my sholder and i felt so warm and loved.My head on my soft sweet pellow comfurted my head as my matress contured the rest of my fragile body.And as i closed my eyes, everything got better.As soon as i closed my eyes, i knew everything was going to be alright.While at my cousins, it was very hard to sleep on a matress so hard and in the same bed as my kicking sister.But in my bed, im all alone.All the room to myself and all my dreams able to explore the room without anybody awaking and bugging them.And for the first time in one month (I stayed exactly one month at my cousins) I had finally had a dream.You know what kind of dream? My usual, non making sence dreams.And my non making sence dreams means SO much to me...It just makes me feel happy and sad, excited and grumpy at the same time.Oh how happy i was to see my worst enemy flying away in a hot air balloon and yet i was sad to see my only compitition fly away and never to be seen again.I have so many different feelings in my non making sence dreams and im so happy to be seeing them again.Seeing the things i missed the most that i couldnt have had for 1 month.Im for sure going to be lighting up all the candles around my room probably tomorrow at night.. it'll be relaxing and thats for sure =)

       As the days approch..Thinking about high school gets scarier.VERY freaky.What classes will i go to? Will i find my way around? What if i cant turn the dial thing on my locker? =P I dont know but im going to have to find out sooner or later.At least my next door neighbores go to the same high school as me so they can help me (Ones 1 year older then me and the other is 2) I hope im going to be in my friends classes.I will DIE without being in one class without at least one friend... And maybe a cute guy too =) Hehehe jk.I know i cant be stuffed in a locker because the teachers said we dont fit =P (We took a tour around the whole school before elementary school ended) But the lockers are big enough for all our school stuff.oOo And the main thing im wondering about... Does our school supply list and info come in the mail or what? Agth, at Elementary school they didnt give us too much information about this.. they think the kids can predict the furture or something.Walking past my elem. school to go to my high school will seem very very odd for me.Concidering my elem. school and high school are right next to eachother.. Infact, seperated only by 1 gate! =) Check out the gym for the high school.. P.E Will be fun.Same with drawma.My drawma teacher looks like Albert Instien or whatever =P White poofy hair.. freaky.The cafateria food is good.We tasted some when we took the tour.The schools big so i know im going to have trouble getting around =P In fact, the washrooms are clean too XD Very nice.The problem is the ppl... they all look freaky too me.VERY freaky.No one my size except one kid thats prob 2 cm smaller then me so called smurf.Anyways, im off now.Ill leave my thoughts like this...

      Ok, if someone likes something then admitt it, they will most likley copy it right? Well i hate it that when you copy something and yet change it, people spaz and get mad.Why? Well i dont care  but i have rights you know =) Anyways, yes, i did chose this layout cause i liked it and i bet that someone will auto thing that i copied it off them.I didnt.I changed my layout then checked some other blogs and found out they had the same one.Anyways, i cant just assume things but its a guess.That brings me to my "too many" topic.Ok, if 5 million people are talking behind your back .... is that too many? In my opinion, even 5 would be to many.I want people to say comments to my face and not write them - Say them.I have to admitt that i dont like mean comments to my face but i rather have them to my face then a paper,diary or blog.So come on, dont wimp out.If you feel a way about me, say it to my face.NO dont write it in your little diary.MY FACE.Ok? I think you get the point now. =) As you can tell, im in an ok mood.The reason is that i might have friends over tomorrow and i cleaned my room and gave it a fresh new look.If you knew me, you dont im not tidy at all.My beds not made, the clothes in my closet is scattered everywhere, my shelves are full of crud. (Paper that i dont even use/need anymore) BUT! I cleaned EVERYTHING.My bed is always made starting from today, (I should keep a chart or something) I threw away two bags full of paper from like 3 years ago with schoolwork on it, I dusted everything and best of all i cleaned my closet and everything is in place. I got a new thingi that also says stay out and come in just to make my room better =D I found some long lost items =P And i put this cute little office thing witb stickies hanging, pens in a pen holder and paper with numbers and paper for notes around.I really like my room and even better is the fact that my pc is in it!

       And it is, the day that i am home.I can see my baby sister Nicole, My second youngest sister Rebecca and my mom Maria.Im like, SOOO happy to sleep on my own bed and stay all day on my own pc in my own room with my own stay out sign.I wasted my summber break  on a place that i didnt even end up having fun in.How great.Well, i dont care if the so called "person" reads this because they did make me mad and sad.Im so happy i dont have anger built up in me anymore because i had to burst on the last day i stayed at my cousins.Crying and in so much anger.My cousin Adina (My other cousin) suported me with her warming hugs and yet i was greatful that one person cared about me.And you know what? I showed her respect back.I learned there that it REALLY DOES matter if someone treats you nice.I know it sounds stupid but if you actually in my place, you would know what im talking about.Well, i cant write any more about my days back then because they will just get me angry.Im going to write about tomorrow for which tomorrow my 4 best friends are coming over and having a water fight with me.Ill keep an update and tell you about it.but i plan to have fun the rest of my summer and i hope nothing will stop me.
