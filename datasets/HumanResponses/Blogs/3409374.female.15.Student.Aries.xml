      Today, i was supposed to practise for my violin exam with my fren at school, but it seems that the practice rooms with pianos have been taken up, and the stupid General Office didn't want to give me the key to the only room left with a piano, claiming that there was no teacher accompanying me. *sigh* We don't even have the right to make our own music. Sheesh. -_-' Well, with nothing to do, we went to watch Shrek 2, and it was funny...but somehow, i still prefer Shrek 1. And good news!! Donkey has donkey-with-dragon-wings children!! Actually, i find tt's kind of sick. Oh well. As i made my way home, i was wondering how i treated J yesterday. I felt that i gave him the wrong impression...when we met, i was like -blank- nothing to say lor, so i think in that awkwardness, i think i gave him the wrong idea that i'm arrogant or something...Oops...now how...hope things would be cleared up soon. Sigh...it's finally the hols but there's homework in front of me...can run but can't hide...i wish i was the fairy godmother in Shrek 2...so can "whiz" the homework away. Heehee.

      I watched the best performance by the SSO today!!! There were 3 choirs, 8 lead singers, a huge orchestra that included a mandolin, 2 pianos, pipe organ, tubular bells and cymbals...it was SO majestic!! I wanna watch it again!! Especially the finale...it was absolutely, totally brillant. Before that, i had a pleasant dinner wif Zab at Thai Express...the curry chicken & pineapple rice was fab...service was good too...tt's why service charge added up to a grand total of $1.58 *argh* Anyway, after dinner, we walked around, but everything was so expensive; or maybe we were just poor...haha. After that, Zab bought cotton candy and we sat near the river, enjoying the view of the sunset. So romantic.Haha. Then it was time to meet J. He called then i went to find him...at first, we hardly recognized each other but we eventually did anyway. Passed the precious ticX to him and we awkwardly went our "separate ways". Haha...i had hoped that we would be able to start a conversation, but when i went there, i guess everything just went blank. Haha...nvm. I'm still in awe of the massive majesty of Mahler's symphony...haven't recovered yet...dun wanna cos it's so nice. I hope they perform it again...sigh...i wish the night didn't have to end. :(

      Sigh...the holidays are over and i dunn feel the joy of it though....there's hardly anything to rejoice about - there's emath and amath homework, tonnes of physics questions, 4 essays of CHINESE to write and one 200+ long chinese book to read...what holiday? Tell me about it. -__-' Yay...tomorrow is mahler concert and R's surprise birthday party...hope she gets surprised...or else what's the point of it. I'm missing out on all the great movies...always fully booked...can't watch shrek2 or troy, cos that day when my frens are going, i'm supposed to do mountain-climbing...nvm...anything for nature! At least it's much healthier than sitting in a dark room stuffing urself with popcorn. HeeX. Drawing diagrams for physics is really getting on my nerves and i can't imagine what the MEP camp would be like. We would all be dancing like elephants..haha...and with guys, i think that's even worse. They'll probably step on our feet, and we would probably step on theirs. Haha...an eye for an eye *evil grin* Sigh...i dun feel like doing anything right now...so bye :)

      Today was cross-country, and i didn't even run properly. After the exams, everyone was just so lethargic, so no one wanted to run, juz wanted to slack. Haha...me and my frens walked all the way through the jungle but when we reached the road, something came over me and i started running to the finishing line all by myself..haha...adrenaline rush :) School nowadays is juz so slack man....when we came back, ppl were talking, sleeping, reading, discussing CIP etc....so xian. Why do they bother to keep us in school anyway? But after recess, we got this drum group to perform for us...all kinds of drums...cuban, latin, indian, etc...it was way cool when they all played together, even though they were all from different countries *harmonisation* haha... Every day is so xian...the three things i do are: play piano, play violin, go online. Even though it's xian at home, i also dun feel like going anywhere...i find it quite pointless too, walking along Orchard Road doing nothing...juz tiring my legs up...haha Anyway, supposed to see someone online today, but i guess school isn't over yet on the other side of the island :)

      Sigh...the pains of first love...why must it happen to fellow teenagers like us at this point of time? U see a person of the opposite sex and then sparks fly...but that's what U think, not the other person...but u think the other person thinks the same way. You live on this false hope that he is attracted to you and that's how u carry on with your life. But somehow, you can tell that he doesn't feel the same way, but denial sets in and you continue to believe that false hope...you enjoy the feeling of first love -- a little spicy and cozy, but bitter as your heart longs for him. But after a year or so, this feeling starts to subside, and u try your best to cling on to it -- after all, it's your first love and u wanna enjoy it forever...but it just fades...leaving your heart as it first entered. But sometimes, it never goes away; but u obviously notice that he doesn't feel for you...then u hurt, u cry, u try to forget, but it never leaves u alone...the feeling never goes away. Congratulations, u haf been plagued by love. And then after the feeling subsides...u get that feeling on another person again. And it's the same old cycle again and again...sighz...when will this torture ever end?  *An owner of a lonely heart is better than an owner of a broken heart.*

      I can't stand my class anymore!! All they care is about results, results and results. It's getting on my high-blood-pressured nerves!! Arrggggh!! I had juz been through a horrible day, with exam papers coming back at a nerve-wrecking pace...and i was breaking up in cold sweat...thank goodness it's over...i think ppl thought i peeed in my pants cos i sweat so much!! Hahaha... Ok, cut the crap. After the ordeal, everyone got up and started comparing marks, and that really PIsSeD me off. "Wah...why u get so high?" "I so careless!" blah blah...hallo, people, wake up!! What's done is done! Juz forget about it and move on man! Enjoy your recess!! But of course, who listens to me? I'm like the only person who thinks like that in my nerdy class...well, except for some people :) Actually, what's there to moan about in the first place? We did very well for almost all the subjects, and there people not smiling but sulking. I tell you, my class is insane..they have way too high expectations of themselves...and that's stressing me up! And that's not all. When the teacher came in with the marksheet, everyone rushed forward like bees...i was like "come on lah...u checked ur marks like a thousands times already lor.." I couldn't be bothered. I juz slept. And I can't stand T anymore!!!! She's is so so irritating!!!She was the first one to rush to the dreaded marksheet and there she goes wif her arrogant voice saying "I am supposed to get A1 for physics...i got twenty-somethings for my past tests that were upon 25 and 30...A2 is impossible." And she keeps repeating that over and over again to every gal and guess what? I was next to all the commotion! Arrrrggggh.... I can't stand it...I can't stand everyone...everyone is only interested in academics!! Can't their blinded eyes see that RESULTS ARE NOT EVERYTHING?  P.S. Sorry I very angry today -_-

      HaiZ....first day of school was quite bad, actually.  Firstly, in one day, 3 projects were thrown at us...SS, Chem and Math. And the great news is tt other class needn't do the chem and math projects...the teacher juz using my class a guinea pigs to experiment their new teaching methods. *shakes head* Sighz. Deadlines also so fast. Math project deadline in 2 weeks time. Sad.  Secondly, amos is in hospital for hydration for a WEEK. Can u imagine how long is tt being stuck there? Mi bro sure bao zha one day...oh yah, and he needs a new kidney soon; the signs are so obvious. Sighz...i think i haf to give it to him, if no one wants to donate. Then again, it must match. So...haiz....quite worried for him...  Thirdly, there're some rumors going on in school about me. Steph came up to me tt day and then asked me "u got bf is it?" I was like ... "WAT!? NO!" And then she said dunno wat rumors about me and tt MEP camp guy...aiyoh...i bet it's xinhui's fault. She and her big big mouth. Comeon lah...cannot be frens meh? Anyway, he's the one who sms-es me...and for the last time, i dun like him in tt way ok? We are juz frens ....want me to spell tt out again? WE ARE JUZ FRENS!!  Ok...enough said...haf to research on my SS project on conflict ... just when there's so much of it to choose from in my life...

      Yesterday was confession night man...the biggest confession of my secrets anb burdens to someone...haha...all about bgr...we both confessed our problems to each other and i guess tt lightened both our hearts quite a bit. Ahh...now i feel more relaxed liao. LoL Aiyar...he kept asking me to tell...but i still can't leh. I dun haf courage. Hum ji. Haha. Anyway, after listening to each other, we were wondering y on earth did we tell each other in the first place. So i guess he has become my confidante and i have become his. It's good to haf a listening ear sometimes :) Guess wat...i admitted i had an infactuation on him for a while...and u know wat he said? He said he felt it too!!!!! I was like...[jaw drops] Haha...sadly, it was only an infactuation...haha...he called me unfaithful [jokingly] but then later he said "i'm not like u...i'm loyal". Now i'm confused...was tt supposed to be a hint or something?  Sigh...i'm useless at spotting this kinda hints. And it hurts sometimes if u do it wrongly.

      Yes...i'm back from my extremely long vacation to Sabah...lasted 10 days...ok...here's what i did:   #Day 1   We flew from Singapore to Brunei then Brunei to Sabah on Royal Brunei Airlines. No, i'm not tt rich to fly SIA...anyway, amos snatched the window seat as usual [big baby] and i ended up craning my neck to see wat was outside. U know, i dun get to sit on planes often. By the time we reached the Kota Kinabalu [KK] Airport in Sabah, it was already 8pm. Blame it on the stupid transit at Brunei...2 hrs 50 mins waiting...thank goodness i brought Angels & Demons along. Anyway, we reached the KK National Park at 10 plus, then quickly checked in to the moth-ridden, forsaken hostel tt we had to share with 6 other peeps. YuX. Moths just gimme the creeps. But i surprisingly slept fairly well tt night...at 12 midnight though.   #Day 2   Ok, now at 8:15am, we started our super-long journey up Mt. Kinabalu. The trail is 8.72km long, and for today, we were supposed to finish 6km of it to reach the rest house, Laban Rata. It was an enjoyable climb, cos i didn't carry anything...haha...and also the air was very cool [but dry and lacked oxygen]...then u see weird caterpillars wif red caps on their heads and funny-looking plants. Anyway, the journey seemed to drag longer and longer and me and my bro were starting to wish tt Josh had followed us :( But we finally reached Laban Rata at 1:15pm...a whole 5hr climb! It was cold up there, i tell u. Dunno how many thousand feet. Air was very thin too...caused me to haf fever and headache. *bleh* We then checked in to our rooms, bathed wif hot water [tt was shiok] and then slacked the whole day, cos a helluva time awaited us the next day...   #Day 3   Woke up at 1 plus am to start to climb to the summit...DAMN COLD!!! Last night was like 9 degrees already and now even colder. Armed wif a few layers of clothes and about 4 litres of water, we started our climb to the summit at 2am. It seemed easy at first, but i was light-headed and all from the fever even after a panadol...then after the easy part came the rope part. It was all rocky...no soil at all to step on, so we had to cling on to ropes...in the dark!! We had no idea how steep it was till the return journey. It was pitch-dark, and we were only armed wif torches, which some of them conked out along the way. Sigh...the unreliability of technology. Anyway, the climb started to get more and more monotonous and tiring...cos it was getting colder and colder...everyone's hands were numb...feet aching...aiyoh, in other words it was torture. The summit seemed to be sooooooo far away...but finally, when the horizon showed signs of orange, we had finally reached the summit, in time for the sunrise. But poor me, so freezing cold tt i didn't bother to stand up to see it, juz hid behind a rock to block of the wind. Ok...then when the sun was up, it was time to come down. Then we realised how steep everything was. What can I say? It was REALLY steep. At one part, i wondered how i managed to conquer tt steepness in the dark...i tot i was sleep walking. LoL. Anyway, we took a scenic walk down to Laban Rata, where we rested there for awhile...cos stupid me got fever and a severe migrane. Then, 1 1/2 hrs later, we set off...this time, all the way down. I tell u, our knees and toes and feet were aching so bad at the foot of the mountain. But we were glad cos we had conquered the tallest mountain in SE Asia! Yay... But then, we still had to stay at the moth-ridden place...yuX...i literally had to close my eyes to bathe...but we were so exhausted we all slept early and well.   #Day 4   Woke up this morning and couldn't get outta bed!! All our legs were SO pain and aching...i nearly collasped when i stood up. But today was the day to rest at Shangri-La hotel in KK town!! Finally a sign of civilization. Our van drove us all the way to Shangri-La and 2 1/2 hrs later, we were enjoying the luxury of the hotel...well, not that it was 5-star or anything, but basically anything is better than that moth-ridden place in the national park. After resting some more, we went shopping...wa...got lotsa shops and clothes leh...delicious food too.   #Day 5  Today, we went to explore the flawless beaches of Pulau Sapi, one of the 5 islands off the coast of Sabah...haha...quoted tt from a tourist pamphlet...anyway, we spent the whole day there...the sand was so white, and the colourful fishes [stupid too] swam right up to shore...they were so close to us...some even banged into ur goggles. My bro used a "magic coral" to attract them...tot it was food...so dumb...haha. We were all burnt tt day. Abe looked like roasted kampong chicken. LoL. At 4 plus pm, we took a boat back to the town.   #Day 6  Today was beach day again...this time, we took a pubilc bus no.16A to Tanjung Aru Beach...a flawless beach too...but no fish...i used my sarong to cover my sunburns cos so pain...haha..then built sandcastle...after that, the clouds grew so dark and from a distance, it looked as if a typhoon was forming...like Day After Tomorrow like tt...so scary. We quickly packed all our things and cao man...the wind blew the sand up until in swirled into our eyes...damn pain but we managed to make it to shade when it finally poured. Scariest storm i have ever seen. After the storm cleared, we took the bus back to our hotel [no more Shangri-La, by the way] then wash up. Then At night went shopping and spent $300++ RM worth on clothes...haha...then went to eat famous char kueh tiao and went home contented wif new clothes. But then, we had to squeeze into 2 single beds throughout the whole night and stupid amos push me off the bed to the floor. Argh.   #Day 7   We went back to the countryside via express bus and i tell u, in the bus, i had the rockiest toilet-going experience of my life. Nearly fell into the toilet bowl. Ok...with grose things aside, we then headed for Poring, where the hot springs were. The hot springs were not wat i imagined them to be...cos they actually already channelled the sulphur [and burning hot] water through pipes into individual pools. I tot it was jus a rock pool where u juz jump inside and get wet and burnt too. The water was soooooo hot! I was like going "ooh" and "aah" and jumping up and down like a xiao lang...but after tt, u get used to it.  We spent a night there at a 2-storey chalet...shiok right? It was a nice place to stay in. But the next day, we had to leave. Oh yeah...i forgot...we also went to the canopy tree-top walk...quite high lar, but the distance so short one. My little bro freaked out...but he made it to the other side anyhow.   #Day 8  This was another day of rest...we went back to the town again and sleep i think...forgot wat i did...haha..maybe shopping? i dunno.   #Day 9  Anyway, as our trip approached the second-last day, we went to stay at another island again, called Pulau Manukan. This island damn nice man...beaches so clean, water so clear, fishes so big and greedy...haha...when we went snorkelling, we saw all kinds of stuff too, including starfish, blue ones...so cute...too bad we didn't have underwater camera. TT day, we stayed one night at another 2-storey chalet made of wood...it was on top of a hill and facing the sea...downright beautiful. U hear the sea from every angle of the house. Sigh...i miss it now :(   #Day 10   Ok last day now...time to go home...sigh...the boat ride back was miserable...cos Manukan is such a nice and laid-back isalnd. After reaching town, we met up wif my mum's long-lost fren for lunch and went to her house. Sayang-ed her 4 dogs for the whole afternoon b4 heading to the airport. Enjoyed the fllight back cos the food was nicer and i got the window seat!! Hahaha. By the time we reached Singapore, it was 10 plus pm already...then we all so shack, reach home only, never bathe go and sleep already...haha  Oh...how i miss Sabah...so fun...so memorable :) Now i all sunburnt and peeling...HeeHee

      So fast. I'm leaving for Sabah tomorrow...about16 hours more to go...  Sigh...today was so unexpected. My bro went to see doctor, and now he's being hydrated in hospital...so last minute! Sigh...he and my mum fight again...my bro doesn't want to stay, he's been there ever so often and he's sick of the endless corridors and that medicated smell that the hospital seems to reek of. But now my bro blames my mum for passing him the disease...sigh...it's hard being Mum when ur own son hates u. Today, he sent me an email that has so much truth in it... "The hardest thing to do is to see someone u love, love someone else"..."what if tomorrow never comes?" But telling that person about ur feelings for him is easier said than done. The email sort of asked me to hurry up tell...haha...but i just can't do it...disappointment is too hard to bear...i rather live in a rhapsody of lies and fantasies...  Now i'm alone at home, without my bro...somehow i am not excited about the trip, cos someone's not going anymore...he went for last year's mountain climbing and i was so happy...for that 4 days, i knew we liked each other...but now, i guess all is lost once again. But i just can't forget...remicising the good times...

      Today is Friday!!! Yay...i'm going to Kinabalu in 1 days' time...better than staying at home doing nothing...haha. But I guess i'll miss ppl over the 10 days. Nvm. Haiz...yesterday my brother had to use the computer juz when i turned it on and realised something. Sigh.  Aiyar...i really nothing to do now, dun even know what to write. If i ever think of wat to write later, i guess i'll just come back to it later. Haha.  Ronan Keating  If Tomorrow Never Comes   Sometimes late at night I lie awake and watch her sleeping She's lost in peaceful dreams So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark And the thought crosses my mind If I never wake up in the morning Would she ever doubt the way I feel About her in my heart  If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes  'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life Who never knew how much I loved them Now I live with the regret That my true feelings for them never were revealed So I made a promise to myself To say each day how much she means to me And avoid that circumstance Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel  If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes  So tell that someone that you love Just what you're thinking of If tomorrow never comes

Someone help me please?  The Reason - (3:52) I'm not a perfect person as many things I wish I didn't do but I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you and so I have to say before I go that I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you it's something I must live with everyday and all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away and be the one who catches all your tears that's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you and the reason is you and the reason is you and the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you and so I have to say before I go that I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show a side of me you didn't know a reason for all that I do and the reason is you

      Today was the last day of camp...and i now i am totally shack man...it's finally over, but it was fun though...made many new frens from other schools and had tonnes of fun yet embarrassing moments, come to think of it. We started the day with 'interaction' games, as it was called. Each group was supposed to build the tallest structure that can balance a ping pong ball or tennis ball. Of course, the heavier the weight of the ball the higher points we get. Then there was a second part to the game. Each group will have to dress up a pair (xx & xy) to look like Mrs. and Miss Latin America!! And guess who was the unlucky/lucky (depends on how u look at it) gal...ME -_-' Yes yes, but this time Xinhui didn't  sabo  me...it was her TKGS frens. *bleh* They wrapped me up with cloth and toilet roll, played wif my skirt, hair, ears (for earrings)and even drew on my face with lipstick! That was bad enough...but even worse, the camera man came around twice or thrice and filmed me -_-' stupid camera man. Then time was running out. The tower was done but the guy was not done yet! So the ppl quickly dressed him up wif the garbage bags provided...so ugly...but damn funny man...when i looked at the other groups, i wanted to roll on the floor and laugh till i die...but that would ruin my costume. Haha. Zab was so pretty!!! Wif flowers everywhere...so her group won best dressed lah of course. Our tower was quite successful, was second tallest. Yuxin's group had the tallest and they were the overall champs for games, followed by my group. Heehee...*BOLIVIA ROX!* Anyway, the time for performing was getting nearer and nearer...when we went up on stage to rehearse, we were like...wow, the stage so bright and also quite big leh. But we were quite prepared lah after rehearsing. After that, we were like slacking, cos practise until so xian so got nothing to do...but soon the time came. I tell u, i was SO nervous lor, cos my partner is a guy, and i am right in front, and i knew the guy's frens will start oohing and aahing...i was so damn scared...my face became like tomato...haha. Anyway, we were 2nd and i performed as usual...lucky thing didn't miss any step although i bumped into one person behind. Nvm...but of course there was oohing and aahing lar, but now i'm glad it's over. We didn't win of course. Cherie's group won, firstly because she was leader and secondly because her facilitator was a dance himself...our facilitator was Ms. Tsien. *bleh* But i dare say i had a great time...then at the end of the camp, my guy partner asked me for my no. and i was like "Huh? o-kay..." I really really never expected him to ask ok...then my stupid frens made fun of me all the way to the bus stop outside. Sigh...btw, no need to be jealous ppl, he isn't that cute. Haha...being mean again... Anyway, i'm now back home and i have made a new fren among others too. Thank goodness i didn't lose the other fren. *whew*

      Haha...today was day one of MEP camp, and i realized MGS gals are the most minority in taking MEP!! Oh no...u know, TKGS and St. Nicholas and Dunman High all got quite a lot of peeps taking MEP, esp. TKGS. ACS(I) also not many, though. Anyway, this year's camp theme is the most outrageous one...it's about Salsa dancing. Can u imagine? It's Latin dance!! Haha...so sensual some more...some more got guys, but i survived anyway. HeeX. At first, we were all like very clumsy with our steps, but after a whole morning of training, we got used to it. Then the bad news came. We had to chereograph a performance! Can die man. So xian. At first, everyone in my group dun talk to each other...but after a long time, everyone got used to it. And guess what, stupid Xinhui sabo-ed me and now my partner is a guy.  -_-' Can u imagine? For Salsa, he has to put his hand on my back and hold hands and all...YuX...but i guess it's all in the name of dance. Well, at least he's not so bad. Some guys, esp. this guy called Marcus, is known for grabbing u on the back ok!! Then his hand sometimes also move higher and higher...damn sick...my fren  kana  him as dance partner so she told me...aiyoh...damn grose...luckily i never partnered him. Whew. After chereographing 2/3 of our dance, we went for tea break no.2 (haha...so many tea breaks) and then i saw Josh. And he was wearing glasses! Amazing. After that, we learnt about posture and physical and eye contact. I tell u, i can never keep eye contact with my partner man...he's a guy some more and not my fren also...die ar tomorrow...how to perform? Sighz...Xinhui, it's all ur fault *bleh* Nvm...soon the day was over and now my legs r still aching from 5-6 hours of dance...can't imagine those dance gals...must haf gone through more pain than us when they trained for dance nite and SYF.  I wonder how tomorrow would be like...esp. the performance bit.

      Today is probably the most exciting day of this week. My damily & i went to climb Gunung Lambak today...and i tell u it was so steep man! For the wole 510m, at least 3/4 was steep. My parents took this opportunity to play with their new digital camera...haha. Anyway, shortly after we reached the top, we went down another path to some radio station. There, we were not allowed to take photos [dunno why] but we took anyway...cos the scenery there was fabulous, like New Zealand. Haha. Then we went down stretches of road down to the main road. Quite exhausting lar, since the path down to the radio station was so  xiong , and that the weather was getting hotter by the second. Then we took a Malaysian public bus to where our car was! Cool right? Haha...my first time taking a public bus in Malaysia. No air con, but lotsa wind. They dun haf EZ-link cards, but u juz pay the driver direct...can get change even...haha. Bus stops the moment u flag it...no need to be at a bus stop sometimes. Haha. We then took a taxi from the bus interchange. When we reached our car, we thanked God that it was not stolen [as the taxi driver told us horrfying stories earlier on] then we went to cool ourselves down with watermelon and my parents ate lotsa durian...actually, uncle R ate lotsa durian. He kept digging into the shells for more. Yew. YuX. After that, it was free-and-easy. Went shopping and then went to eat a late lunch...the famous Yong Tau Foo at Taman Sentosa, Johor. So shiok!! Haha. Drank all of the soup until my bowl was sparkling-only-with-oil clean. *YumYum* Causeway was jammed as usual...took us 1 1/2 hours to get the singapore. But it was worth it i guess. A day of exercise is always good...plus we took home tonnes of pics. Heehee.

      I'm caught in a fix...i juz realised i haf to include a sonata into my repetoire of pieces, but now i can't cos the Bach takes up so much time and if i replace another piece with a sonata, i would exceed the time limit!! Argh.... Today's the first day of hols - 1st june - and things are looking depressing already. Well, but at least i'm gonna go on holiday in malaysia as well as the esplanade library to do research...Heehee...should be nice :) Too bad something...nvm  Anyway, i think i'm gonna enjoy the MEP camp coming up this week...cos that's the only thing i sorta look forward to...or else, i would die of bordem.  Sigh...nothing to write now...oh...1 mth to my violin exam!!! Argh...

Thank goodness they are asleep already.  Sigh...Jt online juz now and once again i hinted to him tt i haf feelings for him but he juz didnt get it. Sigh. "everyone falls for me but yet no one falls for me". Jl is freaky. He said tt day tt it was a pity tt on musical night he didnt see me for a longer time. Eeek. then there was him calling me chio...scary man. Am i chio? i'm really confused.    Then got 3 tests tmr and i cant seem to get any chinese in my head cos it's either thinking of Jt or next sat when i'm going to  urlLink library@esplanade  to accompany Jn. Sigh. Thank goodness tt day accompany him wasnt so awkward. When mrs chan saw us, she was quite surprised we knew each other. LoL. I realli hafta practise cos tt day was quite bad. nearly late for tuition as i reached home at 7:20pm.  Left sch at 6:40pm.  Mixed-up me. Self-identity: dunno. Bgr: dunno.

      Finally the com is working...i just click here and there and it suddenly just worked.Lol.  A few things happened over the past few weeks or days. Firstly it's the musical. Everything's so predictable. Rong xin got the main role, but nathania also got a main role too and she was good. Superb. Amy can sing so well!!!  Then Tiffe likes Jonathan! The whole chinese lesson i disturb her like xiao and the best part is she never says no when i say it's so obvious tt she likes him lor. Even went to musical TOGETHER and snyo concert juz to watch him play. So romantic. Lol. Their sweet love never fails to remind me wat i used to have....sigh.  Today J.n and I practised for the first time and it was so not together lor. But in the end it was ok larh. He ar, dunno how to count properly one. Thank goodness it wasnt as awkward but he so ego one...claims he did all the talking. Bleh...aiyar dun care wat he says. But we definitely need to practise some more. LoL...when mrs chan saw us together she was quite shocked. "how did u all know each other?" LoL...aiyar...onli pri. sch. frens wat...then later she said "so cute". erm...  Ok...i think tt's about it today...then stoopid hansware cannot install but i'm glad internet can finally work!! yay!!

Not much happened larh, bro is coming back tomorrow, with the dialysis machine and i hope kobe doesnt bite it off. Heehee. Then this friday gonna practise accompaniment wif J.N. Hope it works. Oh yah...then i found Jasper on the net yesterday, so so so long never tok liao. Now he is unexpectedly in Thailand in an international school. Didn't quite expect tt. Ok, then there's concerts and all coming up...and musical! Yay...it's sure to be nice. Too bad i'm not in it :( Anyway, there's accompanying zab too...i juz heard the piece and it's super fast and now i know i'm so gonna die. Then there's J.l.

      Oh my goodness...guess wat i did yesterday...the humungous cat was let out of the bag...heeX  Me and Jt were chatting online and he asked me about my nick cos i was quite depressed...then i said it's not only because of amoi but it's because of crushes and all...then he said u like someone? Then i felt like shouting it out loud...guess who? It's Y.O.U!!! But anyway...i didnt.  But as the conversation progressed further, i realized he only treats me as a sis...and that he likes this super-chio gal in his tuition....Sigh...told u it would never work. Then after tt i told him tt i used to like him [i still do though, but lesser] and asked him if he got the slightest hint...well, he knew lar of course...cos i so obvious one...LOL  So, u could consider tt is confession night [like 25 June] cum breakup night. Looks like i can't like him anymore cos there's really no hope liao lor...So now i officially single. S-I-N-G-L-E. aLONE. It's so different not liking anyone...somehow, the burden's gone but u feel...how should i say it...u feel as if u're like missing something...HaiZ  Weird feelings i haf...and i can't do anything about it...  "Life's kinda messed up right now...every corner seems to be another maze..."

      HaiZ...these last few weeks haf been one ridden with problems, so bear wif me as i sort my life out straight again.  First problem: Bro is in hospital for a long long time liao...only to be discharged on thursday and will come back painfully with a hole in his abdomen where he has to pluck the dialysis machine every night. It is damn sick and pain, and all the more i wanna run away and hide and not see the pain he's going through. When will transplant begin? It'll take very long for a new organ...am i too young? too small? Why can't i do anything to help? Why am i IGNORED?  Second problem: Loneliness has been part of my life ever so long. It has become my friend, my confidante in time of need, which is now. Everyone is caring about him, and that's precisely wat my bro needs now, but somehow i am left out. Some ppl say it's because my parents dun wanna see me hurt. But it's killing me anyhow, which ever way u put it. Sigh.  Third problem: Wat's with J and me? Where am i heading to? Accompanying him, practising every fri for his practical exam? Am i really truly only just friends with him? Can't i face the fact that nothing will ever work out? I'm really messed up...one moment i think we're just good friends, but the nxt moment i know not wat i think...  Fourth problem: It's raining everyday and i haf no idea of this melancholy i feel. It plagues me like a disease. I try not to think so much but it doesn't help at all.  Wat can i say? HaiZ...

      Wah....yesterday so tired...slept at 12, woke up at 12...lol  Anyway, yesterday was quite a long day...but the highlight of it was the snyo concert. It was superb :) and the way the conductor rearranged the Preludium and Allegro was so cool...it became so grand! Anyway, b4 the concert, i met yuxin at PS and guess what, suddenly i received an sms from J saying he saw me. I was like quite shocked ay myself for being so blur cos he said he walked past me and i didnt even see him. Sigh. Anyway, i was to see him later to pass the ticX to him anyway.  Talking about passing ticX, i met J.L to take the ticX at the esplanade library and i tell u it was awkward. Thank goodness it only lasted for a few seconds. Lol. Then after i took the ticX J came along and i passed it to him. Not as awkward as last time, i suppose. Lol. Then me and Yuxin went to the roof terrace. The view was ok lar...dunno why it didn't wow me but maybe because i've been there too many times...  The concert was good and how i wished i was good enough to be part of them. Sigh. During the concert, when i looked over to where J.L was sitting, i always catch he and his fren looking at me. Sigh. I felt like I was being watched all the time. Dunno where J was...somewhere in the stalls, which i dunno where. Nvm  Guess what...after the concert mama actually allowed me to go home with my frens!! Yay...I tell u, i was laughing all the way through the CityLink man cos Gail kept telling lame jokes until i think ppl think we all a bit xiao liao. Lol. But it was so funny. O yah, then i got this sms frm J...he asked me to accompany him for his mep exam!! I was like "sure definitely". Lol...i really look forward to it. But imagine tt day when mrs chan sees us on the exam date. She'll be quite shocked. And suspicious. Lol. No lah...not suspicious lar...what's there to suspect.  But good news aside, Amoi got admitted again and this time i know that time is running out. He's going for dylysis tomorrow liao...and tt means he needs a kidney very very soon and yet, no one has asked me to be a donor...is it because i'm too young? But i'm scared to offer myself too...but if they ask, i will go...sigh...wish me good luck for the days of unpredictability ahead...

      Wah...so long never come here liao...no lah, not so long, only few days...Anyway, on Saturday, went for youth day fellowship at Gary's house...from 6 till 11pm...damn long right? Ate bbq-ed marshmellows [yum] and sotong and chicken...blah blah blah. But that's not the point. Point is, YF is finally gonna start in August! The fellowship was a meaningful one cos we all were like so guilty not doing anything about ourselves and church and all...so i guess this is a good start. Talked about tracting, evangelism, topics to study, outing once a month...haha...really looking forward but dun wanna organize it. Capital l-a-z-y.  But it was like double tragedy that day cos little Victoria nearly drowned in the swimming pool that day...Auntie Tina sms-ed Sarah and we were like "OH MY ..." Damn scary xia. She was at the bottom of the pool when they found her. Thank God she survived. Then mum's dad got mild stroke, so no one send me home that night so they asked Josh to be my escort. I was like damn happy. Hehe...alone with him in the taxi is the perfect time to...haha...let my feelings show? no lah...i didn't...but we talked a whole lot in the taxi...about amos and how that day is approaching where i might just have to give it to him...sigh...imagine the pain...  :: trust in God with all your heart and lead not to your understanding ::  Sadly, he never mentioned what i wanted to hear...sigh. But anyway, it was a nice moment alone without phoebe and my bro. :) Then yesterday we ate dinner together with the rest of them...until i got diahorrea today *dao mei*  Die larh...tmr my violin exam liao, so fast...the thought of it is scary man. BUt i damn lazy so dun wanna practise but still have to...Sigh...nvm

      Today we went as a class to Chao Yang Special School...we didn't really know what we were about to get ourselves into, but the moment we stepped into the school gates, we were told that they were all mentally challenged...then we learned about their problem with implicit learning. Haha.  At first when we walked past the corridors in the school, it was like so serene...cos all the students all watching tv...then we came in and disturbed the peace. Lol. Anyway, Pat and Dior introduced us then the rest of us just sit with the children and say hi. You know, they all look very normal, just like u and i [except for a few]...so cute and adorable :) They're so friendly too!! All started waving at us and smiling and all. After we settled down, we each picked 1 child each...me and limin got 2 super funny children. One was a guy one a gal. The guy ar...so funny...everytime talk about b-i-s-h-a-n, t-a-n-g-l-i-n, lorong 6...p-u-n-g-g-o-l and all the places in Singapore...keep asking us to spell them...then keep rattling about ez-link card. When we taught them origami, he said he wanna fold ez-link card. Then i asked him wat is it for, he said so that he could travel to all these places. Weird. But the way he says it...i laugh until like xiaO...then his fan seems to be mr. bean...haha...damn funny lar he. Then the gal ar, suddenly burst into laughter one...when mr. bean says a joke...so funny...i laughed till i cried then mrs. chen took photo. *bleh* Anyway, after origami we sorta lost track of time then had to play games. Played some running game then jacob's ladder. Everyone was having fun and i was re-living my childhood days! Thank goodnesss we're going again soon. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...and of course, we took less things for granted. The children so cute and lovable...when we waved goodbye, it was quite sad. Sigh. Received an unexpected sms today...haha...ask me whether i going to the casual concert or not...but i not going...hope he's not asking me out...oops

Aiyoh...today when mrs chan asked about the mep camp, xinhui and her big big mouth spread the rumor to the whole class...oh my goodness...i was like no no no no all the way...so stupid...only cherie supported me on if a gal can make frens wif a gal, why cant a guy...haha...good cherie :) Sigh...had a whole big load of bio. today...almost died...oh no...violin exam coming...hope i at least pass.

      Sigh. Today was supposedly the day we were supposed to practice together, but someone's cashcard spoil so cant pay; so cant pay = cant use the room. HaiZ. Then on tt day of class performance someone also cannot make it. So dumb. Wasted my afternoon but who am i to say that in front of him. Make him feel so paiseh. But he could at least treat me to ice-cream....lol....i so childish and super thick-skinned.    Just came back from the creation seminar thing...it was so so good. Wasted lar amoi and gang never come cos it was really really good. The speaker was super well-informed lor. He was rattling off with hard-core evidence about how the earth is actually not billions of years old but instead only a mere 6000 years ago. Everyone was convinced man. I would definitely go for next week's one. And of course, drag some ppl along too.  Haiz...long weekend ahead. Yay! but hw as usual piles up in heaps again. sigh. nvm...all play and no work makes jack a dull boy.

      Sigh...zhen dao mei...i'm down wif sore throat and slight fever and cough. And there's bio test tmr. Sigh. 3 more days b4 saturday. I bet it'll be awkward, but i guess tt's normal. Lol...it's sad and yet...haiz...ti xiao jie fei. Sorry ar, pls pardon me...suddenly all the chinese idioms filling my head instead of bio. LoL. Today ms tan talked about respiration and how we breathe and about lactic acid being produced in our muscles. Made me feel like going for a run. But sick leh. Heehee...tt just an excuse, cos no motivations also. Today Andris gave us a wake-up call during esemble. Mentioned stuff about practising and attitude. Hey...i practise ok...lol...her words were so inspirational tt it caused me to practise just now. Words always have an effect on me. But i really hope it'll have an effect on some of the 1st vlns and 2nds as well, cos some of them really got attitude problem man. sigh. The fate of mgie lies in our hands. Wahahahas. Tmr got bio test on transport in plants...hope i can maintain my results man or else i die...pray hard tt i dun fall sick tmr and tt my faithful panadol will sustain me throughout the day through mep too...i dun wanna miss mep. *african musics rwaks!!!*  Okay...better go sleep now or else fall sick again then cannot go on sat.

      Sigh...uneventful days are here to stay again. The musical is over, and so is the car rally and all...so u can guess the spirit in school larh -- capitaL X.I.A.N.  Aiyoh...these few days my mind has been playing tricks on me. Yesterday i had a nightmare tt something terrible happened to bro and he was wheeled into hospital and suddenly i springed out of bed. I also had a nightmare on Sat night, but fortunately i forgot wat it was.  The comp. being in my room isnt a good idea. Sigh...i'm like quite addicted to it. I must NOT go online in the afternoon!! It's for studying! Sigh...i feel like a drug addict.  These few days have been quite sad, since it's raining and all, ppl crying about the musical and about how it's all gone....today we presented our project to mr. tucker and i found it a bit awkward. Thank goodness it's over liao. No more presentations until biotech fair i think, which is in sept. Sigh...not very far away too.  Today's mon and in 5 days time i'll be meeting up wif J.n. I know it's just purely to practise accompanying him for mep, but after all, he's the first boy i'm going out wif. Doesnt mean anything though. But i'll probably rmb it cos it's the first time mah. LoL.  Ly and i dun know wat to dress up as on teacher's day. Hmmm. Fairytale characters...what should i be?
