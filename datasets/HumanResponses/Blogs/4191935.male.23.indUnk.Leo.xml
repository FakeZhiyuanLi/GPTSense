      The Interim ("Canada's pro-life, pro-family newspaper") has an article on some of the newly-elected young Conservative MPs, including a couple of friends of mine who managed to get themselves elected. Interestingly, it shows that these young MPs are ardently socially conservative, thus mirroring recent Gallup poll findings which shows strong support for traditional family values amongst the younger generation, a rebellion against the permisiveness of the 1960s and the legacy of horror that it left. As discouraging as the election results were on many fronts, it's certainly encouraging to know that the tide is turning and the party is in good hands.

      The article that I just posted reminded me of one I had read a few years back by (in my humble opinion) one fo the greatest libertarian scholars in history, one Walter Block. In response to growing assaults against female students on his campus, his solution was as follows:  " Require that all female students own a pistol or other means of self defense; (e.g., pepper spray or mace, stun gun or other electric shock device) and carry it with them at all times.  The women of Kennesaw, Georgia, an affluent northern suburb of Atlanta Georgia, were once plagued by rapists. This town not only allowed,   urlLink  but required its citizens to be armed   .  You’ll never guess what happened to the rape rate after this progressive policy was enacted ."  You can read the entire article by clicking on the title to this post. While you're there, take a few minutes (or better yet, a few hours) and read his archives on the  urlLink www.lewrockwell.com  website and be in awe of the most consistent libertarian theory you are likely ever to find.

      Mike Adams, a columnist at David Horowitz's  urlLink www.frontpagemag.com  has posted a great article in which he sent a letter to campus women's groups (sorry, I believe they prefer "wimmins") offering to assist their efforts to combat violence against women by training them in proper use of handguns.  An excerpt.....  "Dear Women’s Center: My name is Mike Adams. I am an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at UNC Wilmington, and a regular columnist for the  urlLink Heritage Foundation ’s  urlLink Townhall.com . I am also a member of the NRA and a weekly commentator at  urlLink NRANews.com . I am writing to offer my expertise, free of charge, to Women’s Centers around the nation that are interested in combating violence against women. … It is my opinion that the response to the problem of violence against…female students has lacked a diversity of viewpoint. Specifically, there has been a lack of discussion about the possible benefits of gun ownership among women, particularly those who have been harassed, stalked, or otherwise victimized in the past. As such, I would love the opportunity to visit your campus to talk about the following: *The benefits and responsibilities of gun ownership in general.*The desirability of concealed carry permits for women.*The basic rules governing the use of deadly force. Since I am traveling extensively in the coming year, I believe that I will be able to coordinate a visit to your university sometime in the coming months. Again, the lecture would be provided at no cost to the university. Please contact me immediately, if you think that you would be interested."   Unsurprisingly, he was largely rebuffed and you can check out the responses he got by clicking the link on the title of this post.  On a personal note, I've noticed some people actually checking this blog out, so that's some good motivation to actually post regularly which I will try to do. I've jsut had a really busy couple of weeks at work. Thanks for your patience and keep checking back.

      Ok, so if you've been reading the papers the last few days, you've probably heard that someone at Ryerson University (well, they  call  themselves a university) in Toronto has posted flyers threatening Muslims on campus and sent a letter to the Muslim Students Association's president that also contained threats. Here is my bold prediction: I will bet any willing takers (let's say a beer) that it will eventually discovered that these flyers and letters were  actually  posted by a Muslim or at least a "Palestinian" sympathizer. Some might recall, (well, you probably  won't  recall since the media all but ignored these incidents) that in the weeks following 9/11, there were numerous reports about "hate crimes" agaisnt Muslims on university campuses. Grafitti was found on walls, threats sent to students and to top it off, a Muslim student at Arizona State was found bound and gagged in a washroom stall, the words "Die Muslim" written on his face and an anti-Muslim note stuffed in his mouth. It drew national media attention and the campus held candle-light vigils and increased funding to 'anti-racism" activities. Well, it was all a hoax. This student did it to himself and was eventually convicted and fined for filing a false police report. The number of stories reporting the "hate crime" outnumbered the number of stories reporting that it was all a hoax by 20 to 1. This has actually become a very common tactic of the Left on college campuses, with various ethnic groups staging fake incidents of racism in order to advacne tehir own agenda. I jsut hope that if and when this Ryerson incident is discovered as a hoax, teh media will give it just as much attention as when they presumed it was legit.  For the record, I do recall one incident of a Muslim being threatened on the UofT campus. She was told "We know who you are, where you live, when and where you ahve class. You better watch out." This threat was made against a member of the Tory club's executive becasue she was attending a pro-Israel rally. It never made the paper.

      One of my favourite conservative columnists, Jonah Goldberg of National Review, has added his two cents to the Alan Keyes candidacy in Illinois (read it at  urlLink http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg200408110822.asp ) and while I like Keyes a great deal, I tend to agree with Goldberg's objection to a lifelong resident of Maryland deciding to run in Illinois just because the GOP can't find a good candidate who is actually from the state. Next to sex fiend Jack Ryan and nutcase Mike Ditka, I suppose they could have done worse than an intelligent and articulate guy like Keyes. Put it this way: Keyes would be a great candidate...if he actually had even a remote connection to the state where he is running. Keyes howled, rightly so, when Hillary carpet-bagged her way into New York and when he was running for Senate in Maryland one can presume he would have made an issue of it if his opponent were from, say, Ohio.  Anyways, Goldberg makes a lot of excellent points about the state of democracy today, views I have long held myself. He correctly points out that campaign finance laws that were designed to prevent wealthy people from having too great an influence in elections has achieved just the opposite effect as it now encourages wealthy people to essentially buy themselves seats (see Jon Corzine, Michale Hufington, and now the heir to the Coors brewery fortune in Colorado). He is also right about celebrity-worship corrupting the process as morons like Arnold Schwarzenneger and Sono Bono can actually be elected to high office.

      One of my heroes, Alan Keyes has taken up the challenge of being the GOP standard-bearer in the Illinois senate race against supposed Democratic wunderkind Barack Obama. I personally think Obama is quite over-rated. Sure, his speech was pretty good, but hardly anything amazing. The fact that it was so widely praised, I believe, is an illustration of the overall lacklustre roster of Democratic speakers as well as an example of their constant patronizing of racial minorities, whereby the standard is set so low that any reasonable surpassing of it is equated with greatness. Jesse Jackson Redux, perhaps? Keyes, on the other hand, is  by far the finest orator in all of American politics. You can download his speeches at  urlLink http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/speeches.htm  and see for yourself. Anyways, there's an article in today's Chicago Sun-Times (see link above) where Keyes really takes Obama to task over his support of abortion, accusing him of taking "the slave-owner's position" on this question of civil rights and suggesting that the kind of thinking that supports legalized infanticide is the same kind of thinking that would have the two of them (they're both black) "still picking cotton." This is shaping up to be one hell of a race and it's getting nasty very early on. Unfortunately, Keyes is poised to get his ass kicked, as has been his tendency whenever he's undertaken one of his quixotic runs at high office, but hopefully, this race will get a lot of attention and Keyes can win a few converts for the good side with his brilliant and passionate message of moral renewal.

      Welcome everyone to my new blog, Athwart History (if you don't get the title, go read William F. Buckley's statement on the founding of National Review). It seems everyone I know has a blog these days and I read many of them rather religiously, so it seems only appropriate that I start one of my own. This blog will be updated pretty regularly and will be my way of sharing my thoughts on conservative politics, baseball, books, music, and anything else that interests me. I hope that you wil check back often and share your comments and ideas with me.
