      Clayton and I talked last night about what I want to do with the rest of my life. One thing was certain, I do not want to spend it at this desk in this building. I took some classes last year for medical transcription, but that hasn't panned out. I would like to work with children, so I started thinking about a teacher's assistant. He asked me why I didn't want to just be a teacher. My response (as it is every time he asks this) was "because I can't teach." So he asks me how I know this .&nbsp;&nbsp; I  don't  know this. I do not have a teaching certificate, so I haven't taught. I'm scared that I'll fail. But, in the bottom of my heart, somewhere, there's a&nbsp;calmness when I think about being in a classroom as the teacher.  As a result of talking about this last night, I've gone to the library and checked out a couple books about teaching and careers in education.&nbsp;I've also looked over the course requirements for elementary ed at our local college. Much prayer and consideration will go into making a decision. Hopefully I can decide before the spring semester will start, although I may wait until next fall for optimum financial aid packages. It's a lot to think about when you've been out of college for 5 years and have a family.

      I posted yesterday and it's not showing up. I got an error message when I tried to post, so it didn't take. Oh well. I'm sure no one wanted to read about my Thanksgiving in a Box lunch anyway. (It was YUM for anyone who does care).   Funny story: We went out to eat Wednesday night at a fish camp. Meals are served with fries, hush puppies, coleslaw, and pickled onions. Tea is served with lemons. Andrew was sitting at the end of our booth in his high chair and started reaching for the lemons. Fine, I gave them to him. He started sucking on one and decided he didn't like it. Then the sourness hit him. He shuddered and reached for something else to put in his mouth. Decided that something else would be Clayton's pickled onions. The child loved them! He sat there and ate onion piece after onion piece. I laughed so hard at him that I almost cried. Okay, so maybe it's not as funny as it is amusing. And you probably had to be there.   Visited the dr yesterday about the redness and swelling on my face. Yep, it was an allergic reaction to  something.  Reaction to what? Who knows. I've got meds to take until it goes away.

      Oh YUM! I got take out from one of my favorite meat and three places today. Every Thursday they serve turkey and dressing. Veggies were green beans, creamed corn, and sweet potato souffle. YUM! I'm 'bout to finish it up now.   Angry skin has returned. It never really went away. My face looked a bit better yesterday, but my arms were red and hot. My face is now red and hot again. And swelling. Let's not forget the swelling. I had someone at church tell me I may be allergic to MSG. Who knows. Hopefully the doctor can figure it out this afternoon. I finally gave in and made an appointment with my family doctor. I hate going to the doctor for seemingly stupid things. (This seems stupid to me because I'm just red and swelling, nothing major-I hope). It's not hurting me as much as it is annoying me. Oh, did I forget to mention my eyes burn when I close them and that I've got chills? Maybe it's&nbsp;not as minor as I think it is. Here's hoping for answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      My computer has been updated and the water heater part has been picked up. I'm so excited. I left a rather annoyed sounding message for the computer guy about an hour and a half ago. Maybe I should leave annoyed sounding messages more often. It got results.

      So, I'm doing this Bible study by Beth Moore on Tuesday nights and it's really changing me. Some stuff I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around, but I'm sure with time I'll get it. The very first thing we did is a five statement pledge of faith:  God is who He says He is. God can do what He says He can do. I am who God says I am. I can do all things through Christ. God's word is alive and active in me.   The first 3 things I don't have too much problem accepting. The fourth one I believe, but am I willing to put it into action. I dunno yet. That's what we'll be learning about with this week's 'homework.'  I really like a couple things that Beth has in the book. One comes from Ephesians 1:3-7. She tells us that "In love I am...Blessed, Chosen, Adopted, Accepted, Redeemed, Forgiven." These things are all in the scripture. These things are who I am and what I need to remember when things come my way that aren't easy to handle.   Last night she warned us that Satan figures out what we are most afraid that we are and then sets about to confirm it. For example: If I am afraid I'm a bad mother, then that is what he's going to set out to prove. He's going to get inside my head and tell me all these things I do that makes me a bad mother until I start believing him. Once he gets me down, he's gonna keep me down as long as he possibly can.   God wants us to hold on to Him for dear life. We are to be strong and courageous, not full of fear and discouragement. He says it in His Word. The only way we can do that is through faith in Him. Not an easy thing, but I'm learning.  &nbsp;

       Not happy here. I've been waiting for the computer guy to show up and take care of the antivirus software on my computer for a total of 3 weeks now. He was called on the 6th and said he would be here on the 7th. Never showed up. He&nbsp;FINALLY shows up on the 14th and installed software that interfered with my logging on to AOL. I hate AOL. It's what we use here at work, so I don't have a choice. Back to rant...I called him and he told me how to&nbsp;delete the software and says he'll be back in the morning to install something different. It's now been&nbsp;TWO WEEKS since he had me delete the software and he STILL hasn't shown up. Called Friday to say he would be in Monday. Um, it's TUESDAY now. No phone call to say he isn't coming. If it were up to me, I'd be finding a new computer person. He'll be getting a call from me after I go to lunch today if he still hasn't shown up. The bad part about all this is that the office manager was warned by someone else who uses him that he's unreliable. Why do business with someone you KNOW is unreliable? It boggles my mind.   Now, on to the plumbing supply house issue. I've had this salesperson calling me for about 3 weeks now needing a part back.&nbsp;He says he will come pick up the part himself as soon as I can find it. So, urgent call from him yesterday&nbsp; morning. He NEEDS the part ASAP-that day. So, I start hunting for it and find it. Call him back. He says okay, he'll get someone to come pick it up. You guessed it, the part is STILL sitting on my desk waiting for pick-up. If I had any clue where these people were located, I'd take it back myself. For something that was so IMPORTANT to get back, he's sure taking his time to get it back.&nbsp;He may get a phone call this afternoon as well.   &nbsp;

       So I'm a follower. I really like the idea of keeping my random thoughts somewhere besides my head. Like I can remember them there anyway. So, here's my blog, started today.   On to other news in my life. My face is swollen and beet red. I think I'm having an allergic reaction to the sportwash that I use to wash A's dipes in. My theory is that I got a little on my fingers last night and then touched my face. An antihistimine is doing nothing to change the swollen-ness of my chin and cheeks. I hope it goes away soon because it's really irritating.

      I've got possibly exciting news. I was talking to my teacher friend the other night and she mentioned that her principal announced that there are some positions open for teacher's assistants at her school. There are two open for kindergarten and one for special ed. She said my name popped into her head when the announcement was made. She's going to give the principal my name and number. I'm really hoping this works out for a number of reasons:  1. It will help me discover if teaching is what I really want to do. 2. I'll get all the school holidays off. 3. I understand that the benefits are good. 4. I'll have the summers off. 5. If I do go back to school, then I'll be able to take classes in the afternoon after school gets out.  My only condition right now is pay. I have to make at least what I'm making now or we'll have problems with our budget. I've been ready to leave my current job for awhile. Maybe this time it will happen.

      I've got a friend who has a son just a few months older than my son. He has vision problems. About a year ago, his vision tested at -8. He's been wearing glasses and doing patch therapy for the past year. (His mom puts a patch over the good eye for a few hours a day). She asked for prayer for him Sunday night at church. She prefaced her request by saying that she was going through the Bible study Believing God and that last week, she felt God telling her that if she would bring her son up Sunday night then He would improve his vision. She did. She felt again that she needed to bring it up at Bible study last night. She did. We all prayed for her and her son last night. I got a call a little while ago from her sister-in-law that his vision went from the  -8  of a year ago to  5.5  today.  I'm not sure what the numbers mean, but I do know that going from negative to positive is an improvement. Praise God!

      The V.P. is here today for a lunch/fundraiser. Clayton is one of the lucky officers blocking off roads that the V.P. will be traveling on today. He'll pretty much just sit there all day. That's my interesting news for the day.  I got myself on a committee at church. Never been a committee member before. We're working on a policies and procedure handbook for our nursery areas. Seems there isn't one in place. That will be taken care of in the next couple of months.  I'm teaching Mission Friends this year. This should be fun. The other lady with me said that if I would plan everything then she would do the actual teaching. Sounds like a plan to me. I've just got to find out if we have a book to go by. I've got posters and games, but no book to tell me about the missionaries. I can't plan/teach without a guide.  I've been thinking a lot about this going back to school thing. I'm thinking I'll probably do it. The best plan would be to wait until next fall when there are more scholarship/financial aid opportunities. I haven't yet received the information I requested, so I think my next step will be contacting the school...

      I drank 48 oz of water yesterday. That is not an easy thing for me to do. I've already had my first 16 oz today. I made a yummy low-fat meal last night for supper. I brought the leftovers for lunch today. Tonight's supper will be low fat stuffed shells. YUM. I can't wait.  I have never been so excited to go to the grocery store as I was last night. I couldn't wait to leave work to go grocery shopping. I was getting all the ingredients I needed to cook the meals I have planned for this week. The whole reason I was excited is that we're trying all new things this next week. I like cooking new things that I *should* like.  Oh, the other thing I'm proud of is that I spent my lunch hour walking yesterday. I went to the mall and walked the perimeter. Clayton told me last night that one lap is a mile. I plan to go back today to walk again. I may look silly walking by myself, but it's exercise and I need it!

      I so suck at this. I've been trying (sorta-there's my problem...only sorta trying) to lose weight for a couple months now. I keep fluctuating on my weight. I'm not able to keep it down. I've tried just watching what I eat with no guidelines. I exercised for about a month. I'm just having trouble sticking with it. My plan (new one today) is to head to the library on my lunch hour and check out a couple books on nutrition. Hopefully I can find some meal plans/recipes that will give me guidelines for healthy eating. I've decided that that is the only way I'm going to be able to stay on track.  My first start today was to lose the peanut butter M&M's on my desk. I didn't eat the first one of them today. (Thanks, GMS for the motivational questions). I've also had my first 16 oz glass of water today. I read somewhere to drink water when you're hungry and wait 20 minutes. If you're still hungry, then eat something. I'm still hungry, but since it's so close to lunch time, I'm going to wait. My lunch isn't the greatest today. I've got a ham and turkey sandwich on honey wheat bread and sour cream and onion chips. I should have brought a peach with me instead of the chips. It's time to start rethinking my eating habits. Tonight's supper is supposed to be chicken, but as of 7:00 this morning, it was frozen. I completely forgot to take it out of the freezer last night. We'll probably eat it tomorrow night.  Here's to getting info about eating healthy!

      Oh, how last night's Bible Study affected me. We listened to Beth Moore talk about God's Word being alive and active in us. We are to 'inhale' the Word of God. Inhale as in breathe it in, keep it in our hearts. Then, we are to 'exhale' it. Exhale as in speak it. As a Christian, the only thing that will intimidate Satan is what comes out of my mouth. He's not a mind reader, so what I think about circumstances isn't going to do any good. What I must do is speak out. This truth hit me SO hard. I'm not one to say what I think/believe very often. I'm not one to pray out loud in my own personal prayers. I've been told by several people that praying out loud in their personal prayer time has done so much for their closeness with God. For some reason I'm intimidated to do it, but I asked God last night (out loud) to take away my intimidation. He did! I truly believe He heard my prayers last night and that He was right there with me as I talked to Him.  I believe with all my heart that God is doing a work in me. Why? Because there are so many things trying to get in my way, trying to distract me from what I need to be doing. What is He doing? I haven't the first clue right now. I'm playing the waiting game. And while I wait, He'll prepare me.  Thank you, God for what you are doing in me. Help me to see You in all situations in my life. Help me not to get so caught up in myself that I miss You and Your work. Amen.

      I can't believe it's Monday already. The weekend flew by. Saturday morning wasn't the greatest because Andrew was cranky and I was ill. I had no help since Clayton was sleeping. Gotta love 3rd shift work. Andrew cut his nap short, thereby cutting MY nap short. He didn't want what I made him for lunch. He wanted my Kool-Aid pouch and chips. I finally got him to eat part of his pb&j and then shared the Kool-Aid and chips. After a couple more hours of agonizing crankiness/illness, we left for the pool. A friend from church and I had arranged the week before to take our kidlets to the pool she's a member of. What a blessing that was! Apparently all Andrew and I needed was to get out of the house to improve our moods. We came home happy. I walked in the door to the announcement that I only had about 45 minutes to take a shower and get dressed. WHAT?! Turns out that BIL and his wife decided to invite themselves over for supper. Fortunately, they were providing supper. I can handle that. We get along well and since they were bringing the food it made it all that much better. I ended up crashing when I put Andrew to bed. Company still there and everything. Oops.  Last night was interesting. We had a substitute preacher since ours is on vacation. Let's just say that it could have gotten really bad had anyone at our table made eye contact with another. I just about had to walk out anyway to keep from laughing out loud. We were all SO bored. I hate to say that about church, but in this case, it was so true. Ended up going out to eat at Fire Mountain grill (owned by Ryan's Steakhouse) after the service. My new friend from church joined us. We had a great time.   I really hate being used to sleeping by myself. It makes the two nights Clayton is home difficult sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I love it when he is home, but having to share the bed again is not always easy. Last night was one of those tough nights. My brain just would not shut down. I tossed and turned until 3:30 when Clayton finally decided to go to the living room. If I wasn't tossing and turning, I was having weird dreams. Hopefully tonight will be better.
