      I'm flipping  channels to find some music to listen to and on the 90s and now station we have Ashlee Simpson. I enjoy that song and her cd is lovely too. If I was famous we would be friends and I'd be friends with Lindsay Lohan. She's hardcore with a capital H.  So yea... I'm done her that song made me happy and want to post and now it's time to change the channel and reply to an IM.

I like that song and her cd. She's a good woman. If I was famous we would be friends. I'd be friends with lots of ppl especialy Lindsay Lohan. She's hardcore. Now some techo dance song is playing. Time to change the channel.

       Since I got a "complaint" to update more often from a somebody I've decided to do that right now plus I finally have time to do it. This post is dedicated for Aug 16-20 so here we go...  Monday Aug 20:  1st day of schooling at Henry Clay. The day was confusing and I didn't know where to go. I joined colorguard and almost passout at practice. (Tip...Never decide not to eat lunch and/or drink anything and then go play outside for 2 hrs. Not a cool combo.) Also got homework in math too.  Tues Aug 17:  Overslept a wee bit and discovered an old friend in my homeroom. Old friend and I chatted about warped tour which was awesome b/c he used to hate me.  At lunch, met tons of new kids. One girl might even "like" me.  Gnarly!  Wed Aug 18:  Cousin Tony's birthday. Really don't remember what happened here except went to school.  Thurs Aug 19:  Um... nothing really happened here except school and band practice. Wait...oh yea! I had a mini 5th grade reunion after school. Everyone has grown into lovely young men. What puberty can do for others... It's a lovely thing   Friday Aug 20:  No schooling, skipped band practice,  slept till 1, watched an awesome movie on Lifetime channel, and went to the movies with the friends. Garfield was a gay movie....really gay. Made me laugh only 2 times.  But to sum this week all up... it was awesome. Now its time for to do something. I'll return soon.

      Since I'm watching "The Days" and there's a commercial.... I can post something. It's the season fanale and it was a SOOO obvious that she was going to lose the baby. Tv these days.... But the awesome thing is that they played Snow Patrol. Tv shows have good soundtracks. I'm gonna miss that show. But onto other matters...earlier today I chocked on a bone from a porkchop and thought it was the end. I guess that makes me a true trooper. Then me and mother went to wal mart and made a purchase and then i cleaned my room and began to watch "The Days". Well... its the last moments of the show and im done at the moment. Till next time kids
