      Due to workplace demands, I must travel for the weekend.&nbsp; In lieu of an inspiring diatribe, I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from  The Hunt for Red October :&nbsp; "Hey, Ryan, be careful what you shoot at. Most things in here don't react too well to bullets."&nbsp; See you on Monday.

      According to a recent report on Deutsche World television, the Bundestag is considering raising taxes on junk food.&nbsp; Apparently, Germany is experiencing a recent spike in that most American of social diseases: obesity.&nbsp; In an effort to stifle this growing epidemic before it grows to supersize proportions, several members of the German parliament are lobbying for legislation that would levystiff tariffs on food products that are deemed ‘unhealthy’.&nbsp; The hope is that less of these products would be purchased because of their newfound costliness.&nbsp; In theory, making Big Macs more expensive is a great way reduce the number of (two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onion on a sesame seed bun) I consume.&nbsp; In reality, it means I’ll eat the same amount and just pay more money to eat them.&nbsp; Obviously, when people eat scrumptious delectables such as Crunchie bars and paprika flavored potato chips, they know they are eating something that is high in fat and low in redeeming qualities.&nbsp; Education about the ills of consuming junk food seems to be a more logical alternative.&nbsp; In a country where the staples of the national diet are red meat and starches, perhaps Germany should consider what foods they really want to tax.

      During this year’s Democratic National Convention, Americans and others around the world will tune in to witness the official coronation of John Kerry as the Democratic candidate for the 2004 Presidential election.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s a glimpse of what we can expect to see ad nauseum: the Fleet Center doubling as host venue and maximum security prison, the Clintons preaching to the converted while further enhancing their status on the New York Times bestseller list, Ron Reagan saying something passionate about stem cell research, up-to-the-minute analysis courtesy of overpaid ‘analysts’ who put their partisan spin on whatever is said, and of course, the ubiquitous smiling faces of two guys named John with confetti swirling around their perfectly coiffed heads.&nbsp; Twelve years ago, I remember a similar circumstance where Bill Clinton waved jubilantly to an ecstatic crowd fueled by the optimistic strain of Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Don’t Stop’, and I wonder what the Kerry/Edwards theme song will be at the conclusion of this convention.&nbsp; While many songs come to mind that could echo the subdued optimism of a post-9/11 America, perhaps the newly discovered Beatles recordings are worth examining as possible campaign song candidates.&nbsp; True, we may not know the words to these ‘diamonds in the rough’,&nbsp; but isn’t that better than singing along to the same old worn out record?

      According to a CNN International report, the business of bottled water brought in 8.3 billion dollars last year.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, in the United States, bottled water outsells both beer and coffee combined.&nbsp; The report went on to say that one of the newest trends in water was ‘designer water’, exotic varieties of the clear stuff marketed as this year’s hottest lifestyle accessory.&nbsp; I actually read about this burgeoning trend in United’s In-Flight magazine a few months ago, which really means that it has been the burgeoning trend for quite some time.&nbsp; Woe is me.&nbsp; Anyway, brands such as Voss have been touted by celebrities (Madonna, Pharrell Williams) as having ‘magical’ qualities, being leaps and bounds better than pedestrian bottled brands like Aquafina and Evian.&nbsp; With the millions of people around the world who live and die by the availability of potable water, I’m glad we can spend ten bucks a pop or more on ‘designer water’ and bypass that unsanitary liquid that streams effortlessly from our indoor plumbing

      Just in time for the latter half of summer, Washington D.C.’s arbiters of cool grace us with  The Outernational Sound , an sixty minute long player spanning six continents and a multitude of moods.&nbsp; Unified only by aesthetic and ability to groove, the album’s twenty tracks jump from jazz to samba to dub to funk to Afro-beat at the dizzying drop of the needle.&nbsp; Realizing that ‘world music’ encompasses much more than a Putomayo compilation, Rob Garza and Eric Hilton take us on a sojourn of sorts, searching the musical landscape for beautiful places to bob our collective head.&nbsp; Several standout tracks come to mind.&nbsp; ‘Ya Ma Le’ by the Gimmicks sounds like a forgotten Sergio Mendes/Brasil ‘66 track.&nbsp; Breakestra’s ‘Cramp Your Style’ schools the listener on more than a couple classic breaks, and fellow ESL artists Thunderball and Karminsky Experience also contribute solid additions to the mix.&nbsp; The compilation’s closer, the classic ‘Better Must Come’ by Delroy Wilson, soothes me with its rocksteady rhythm and uplifting message, waking me to the realization that I just spent the last hour in musical bliss, adrift in a voyage of my own making

      The other night, I saw a five year old boy holding his father’s hand across the street from me downtown.&nbsp; As I waited the light to change, the father spoke nonchalantly into a black mobile phone that matched his Hugo Boss suit.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the toeheaded toddler was clad in an olive drab t-shirt bearing the unmistakable visage of the one and only Che Guevara.&nbsp; While it’s entirely possible that the boy is enrolled in some kindergarten afterschool program for young Marxists, I highly doubt it.&nbsp; From clothing apparel to dorm room posters, the image of Che looking off into the distance can be found in the most unlikely of places.&nbsp; Prior to my encounter with the odd couple, I last saw Che in the form of a sticker haphazardly affixed to a garbage can in Madrid.&nbsp; With Che Guevara quite literally becoming a poster boy of sorts, can those that tout his likeness these days truly consider themselves ‘revolutionary’?&nbsp; Unfortunately for Che and all that he represents, the answer is no.&nbsp; The companies that produce these shirts, posters, lunch boxes, etc, are not doing so because their corporate philosophy jives with those of Mr. Guevara.&nbsp; They produce these ‘goods’ because they choose to profit from an unwitting celebrity endorser.&nbsp; Those that purchase, wear, and display such things do so because they are attracted to the perceived trendiness of said items and the possibility that they will become subversive via the transitive property.&nbsp; A hint to those that would like to make a bold personal statement about themselves: wear a plain white t-shirt.

      A few years ago, I asked Evan Dando what he thought about the internet.&nbsp; Dando, for those who might not be aware, was the lead singer of a band called the Lemonheads.&nbsp; Most known for their cover of Simon and Garfunkel’s ‘Mrs. Robinson’, the Lemonheads were the Gen X incarnation of Big Star, and Dando with his boyish good looks, was the poster boy for 90's indie pop rock.&nbsp; He also had a highly quotable cameo role in Ben Stiller’s film ‘Reality Bites’ where he said “I’m Audi 5000".&nbsp; Anyway, some friends and I went to see an acoustic performance of his at a club called Iota in Arlington (VA).&nbsp; The show was pretty good, spanning the saccharine Lemonheads catalogue, concluding after an impromptu collaboration with opener Ben Kweller.&nbsp; Afterwards, a friend of mine approached Evan and asked him if he’d like to hang out and smoke some pot.&nbsp; Not one to turn down a free session, he obliged us with his presence down the street for some lively discussion while getting stoned.&nbsp; Everyone was getting lit, with the exception of me because I choose not to partake in such endeavors.&nbsp; After a certain lull in the scintillating conversation, I hit Evan with my question.&nbsp; He looked at me as though I had just brought up the death of a close relative.&nbsp; What followed was a concise yet telling statement which sums up the way some people may feel about the online experience:  &nbsp;  “The internet sucks, man.”  &nbsp;  Whether this is the majority or the minority opinion has yet to be determined.&nbsp; I did however surmise one thing: hanging out in a parking lot with a stoned former rock star leaves much to be desired.
