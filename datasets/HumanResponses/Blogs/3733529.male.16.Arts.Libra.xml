      My strong left side Josh had a blog site so I knew I'd have to set myself up one. What this really is is a way for me to hand off lyrics to my boy, but I know that anyone else who wants to read this will... so hey everybody. I'm just living one day at a time, I'll be making notes to my sexy 7, my peeps in londres, and you other kids. Thanks for your time and konichiwa bitches to my blog site.

      I love my girls sooo much, I had fun last night with all of you and we have to do it lots more before anybody else leaves. We went to Sarah's house last night and I got to meet her parents, who are amazing hosts apparently. And we rode around listening to rap and hiphop while the girls danced out of the windows and sunroof. ahhhh if ignorance is bliss... We are all going shopping this week, we must we must. Anyway, I'm pretty tired, fuck painting. and im gonna go sleep for a while, ummm. I love Cat(meow), INGI(i'll get you your hat), and sarAH(slow motion). To bad you couldnt come josh... cock  Beer ?

      We were all kinda bored, just came back from Mississippi. We all know how that is... right? Oh, lucky you. We all got together at like 7 last night... you know how that is. We shot some fireworks, we ate some Taco Bell, we annoyed some people... alltogether a fun night. Me, Josh, Josh, Ingi, and of course key cat all were smushed into josh's dinged up tiny ass car. Which added to the enjoyment of the night, calling "shotgun" is harder than you'd think for certain people. I wish that we could have all that fun every night, but i especially wish that all the girls could have been there to chill, it sucked without all my sexy 7. but, whatareyougonnado? Anywho, I'm gonna leave it at that for now, and leave you a song that I wrote about some random girl a while back. Love and shit.

      It really sucks to give your heart to a girl You want to know her like she knows the whole world But 10 seconds in, it's obvious, your going nowhere... She makes you tell her that she's your best friend You tell her things you know won't make her mad Don't want to be the one to say things are going nowhere... Where are you now? Where are you now? I don't wanna talk I don't wanna rock I don't wanna wait by the phone, and, I don't wanna tell you I love you don't wanna tell you I love you, anymore!!! It's hard to live outside her safety zone Cause you remember being all alone Two kinds of misery and either way, you're going nowhere... Where are you now? Where are you now? I don't wanna talk I don't wanna rock I don't wanna wait by the phone, and, I don't wanna tell you I love you don't wanna tell you I love you, anymore!!!  And she makes me want to be a homosexual Maybe I'll be her best friend, maybe see her naked once in a while I don't wanna talk I don't wanna rock I don't wanna talk I don't wanna rock I don't wanna wait by the phone, and, I don't wanna tell you I love you don't wanna tell you I love you, anymore!!!

      Just one more all nighter than I’m calling it quits. Ill give up making the hit list, and I’ll return your shit. But I know it’s not like me to act this way, but I’m wasting all my days away…  So give me this… one more night of manila candles, and drinks So give me this… one more empty coffee cup next to a full shot glass So give me this… one last kiss… Then I can kiss this Goodbye.  I remember your soft voice, I remember the cool breeze, I remember the hot days, laying out and getting tan, and running and jumping and frolicking, some of my favorite things, but all I need are those memories.  I’ll try to forget, our first kiss, on the nighttime stroll, barefoot through the grass. And how the moon was almost full and reflected with us on the water… breathing in unison, touching your lips to mine…  So give me this… one more party till sunrise and throwing up So give me this… one more starbucks cup in my backseat So give me this… one more reminder of one more night spent together like always before… Things change… people go away… and grow apart… we knew that from the start… but wait… I can still hear your voice calling out to me… whispering MY NAME…  Just one more all nighter than I’m calling it quits. I’ll give up making the hit list, and I’ll give back your shit. But I know it’s not like me to say these things, but I’m wasting all my nights away… with my days.

      Well it looks like I'm going to leave tomm. Another short breathe and I'll be able to, take another few steps away from my new home. But I'm only leaving for a little while, and I'll be back... But mabey I will change and mabey I will stay the same... No matter what I'm gonna find me, the same me that my old friends used to know, and mabey just mabey I'll see you in a while or mabey im not coming home. So please... don't forget that I love you. So please... don't let this be the end. So please make sure you say goodbye this time.  Forget that I left you alone, for so long. Can you forgive me, could you forget me? Is this some kind of dream? It's hard to dream if you don't sleep.  Well it looks like if I were to come back, No one would know I was gone, no one would care. It wouldn't matter because since I've been with you I haven't been myself.
