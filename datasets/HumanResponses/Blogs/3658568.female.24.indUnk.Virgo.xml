      These days mummy always nagging non-stop.. 1st about daddy's company..2nd me playing too much games...3rd sisters not giving her enough allowances... BLAH BLAH I act deaf and dumb.. but sometimes just too much can't take it.  Guess sleeping is the best solution! Dear it is not because i want to pig... just that pigging i can't hear... then at night i can stay awake.. enjoying my peace. Though i can only play games and watch tv... better than hearing those 'music'! Hmm.. Dear hope you can take me away... you know i hate all these nagging... and asking me for money when i haven't even start work yet. Wondering now if my salary is enough to survive.. paying my bills... food.. transport... mum's allowances if she don't make me angry. How i wish i am living alone.. by myself nobody to bother me. Am i insane or what...? I am also a human .. got my own worries.. especially now embarking to a new stage.

SMILE  Planning our night.. out with POQ kakiz for dinner.. catch the  Jackie Chan movie AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS --> laugh alot, not a bad show for a moody me. After that as usual we went breko for kopi and watch soccer. Though i don't know much.... i just feel happy with my Dear beside me. Poor Dear tonite won't get enough sleep so sad for my Dear.  My Dear is so nice to me... pampers me .. making me feel adored and happy. i wonder what will happen if my Dear is not around :( Must be nice nice to my Dear. A good catch not easy to get.

Earlier in the day, just went to collect my name tag.. wow I see my name imprinted with the post STAFF NURSE.. many mixed feelings.. feeling of excitement.. anxiousness.. Wearing the uniform.. OMG I am a SN from 1st July. Feeling the tension... need to do some read up before I start work. Wondering if I am able to adapt to the new stage? Better stop killing my brain cells, better enjoy my last 2 weeks bah :)
