      the cup is not half empty as pessimists say as far as he's sees nothings left in the cup a whole cup full of nothing for him to induldge since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  okay papa just called. made me feel slightly better tt shes nt all awkward or anyth. cos she saw.            if i slit my wrists wad wud happen.  no, okay first thing wud anyone care. wud they do an autopsy?   //just.want.the.pain.to.go.away.  if i made two cuts above my eyes maybe the pain wud seep out from there. maybe all the hurt would just wash away. maybe if i drowned myself or something     probably haram to think all these things, yes?  yes.

      cant. do this. on my own.  dont feel like im here anymore. like someone took all the semangat outta me.  and still in spite of all this or because of it  or something this is what my life would be like without him or my friends init. really really empty. and it could be like that. anytime :(   i.cant.do.this.  if u get balasan does it mean u ahvent been forgiven?    try. climb trees and live somewhere else. for once running wont do any good. sadness will follow u anywhere. i could. anytime.  :'(  is it stupid? crying cos u could lose anyone at anytime. him at anytime. stupid stupid stupid. and i dont want to. and maybe i just messed it up . i dont know :( somehow i dun think it wud be as big a tragedy for him. why am i thinking this at all?  i know why.  not on my own.  and the people in the next flat can probably see me all like this staring at teh screen.  maybe this is balasan for yelling at li. i dont know.  maybe running away =wud- help at some level. at least maybe if i didnt see hear or feel anything familiar or anyth from here it wudnt hurt so much. why do we go thru life just flitting thru people? forgetting people or wanting to forget. does it not mean anything :( am i never gonna see you again?    what s the point. self pity? loathe that. but these are just thoughts in my head, am i not entitled to let them out?  why let them out? so they can mess up other people? i think my thoughts would be greyish blue like the colour of bruises. floaty but they sting when they hit you.    i dont wanna be your mistake  not dreaming now. its just a tragedy.
