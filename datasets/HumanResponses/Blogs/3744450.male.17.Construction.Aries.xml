           Sorry guys I haven't updated my blog in quite a while so this post should be a long one, I'm sure you are all waiting on the edge of your seats so I won't tease you any longer.  Well, lets see where do we start?  How about this weekend.  On saturday my parents and I drove down to Sacramento to meet my brother, Josh, and his wife, Jennifer, to go to a Rivercats baseball game, which was my dads Fathers Day present.  So when we got there we checked into our motel room we found out it wasn't ready yet so we decided to walk around Old Town Sacramento since it was just down the street.  So we spent somne time there visting the candy shop and the Gag gift shop, where i bought some gothic spikes to go into my chainmail bracelet, and eating at a pizza shop that was there we headed back to our motel to see if our rooms were ready.  Turned out they were so we grabbed our stuff and booked it up to the rooms and found out that they weren't actually ready but the clening lady was sitting on our bed watching tv.  After and embarrassing moment for her she finished up quickly and we settled in and watched tv for about an hour before driving over to Raley field to watch the game.  I have to say that this was the first baseball game on a large scale I had ever been to.  It was a nice stadium small enough to make any seat a good one but large enough to give you the major league feel.  Onme of the best parts about the game was about 3/4 of the way through the manager of the opposing team, The Rainers, was thrown out of the game after pick and argument with the umpire for reasons I'm still not sure of.  So he took a nice walk of shame as the entire stadium laughed at him, which if you think about it is pretty horrible.  After the game they had some fireworks over right field that were actually better then the ones yreka has on the 4th of July, which is pretty sad. But all in all it was a good time, I even got to buy myself some nice chili cheese fries.  So after the game went back to the motel and slept misrable until about 5:30 a.m. because the room was so stinking hot because my dad didn't want to make my mom cold by turning on the air conditioner.  After awhile though we said forget it and turned that baby on, next thing i remember I know its almost 10:00 in the morning.  Well to finsih off the day when shopped around at the Sacramento Mall and visited the capitol which I had already been to on account of the DCLA trip.  We said our goodbyes to Josh and Jennifer and drove back home arriving at about 9:00 p.m.  The only thing that may have made my weekend not as much fun was the knowledge that I started working at Meeks lumber on Monday and was having some mixed feelings about that.  Nothing to worry about though they only made me dust and sweep the entire frikin store!!!!!  Holy crap that was a lot of dust in the face.  But I finished it today so now I am slightly more happy even though I know that in like three days I'm going to have to do it again.  So heres to endless repetitive task for an hourly wage.  Itd ok though I don't have to go in until 10:00 tommorow which means I get to go to breakfast at Grandma's House with the youth group so I'll see ya guys all there.  Al;though everyones gone so its going to be Conrad, Ryan, and I. Oh well!  Live it large mi amigos and to those who were there live the American Dream!!!!

          Hey! I finally got myself a job!!!! WOO!  I am like royally stoked right now.  Its only a part time job for right now, but who cares? Its still a job and I'll finally have money!  Woohoo, I love money.  Its just got so much you can do with it you're not limited to just one option.  But on a lighter note went to the movies tonight with a couple of friends and saw the Chronicles of Riddick.  Interesting movie a sci-fi with an action thiller category trown in there for kicks.  Wasn't the greatest of movies had some cheesy lines and predictable parts but thats ok.  Hey if movies were like real life we'd save the 4 bucks and go sit on a bench on main street.  So a little unrealism is welcome in a movie.  The funny part was that there were only 6 people in the theatre including me and my two friends so needless to say it was a rather small audience.  You know i just said needless to say but I went ahead and said it anyways.  Thats crazy!  Oh well I guess I have to say it was a nice day all in all.

           So anyone know any good jokes?  I'm kind of bored and things aren't looking like they are going to pick up all that soon.  One thing that happened that kind of sucks is I just bought a compressed air tank for my paintball gun and the darn thing like breaks on me last night!  The valve on it got stuck open or something, but the guy i bought it from told me to bring it in and if he couldn't fix it he'd replace it so I guess its not all that bad.  You know this blog thing is an easy way to keep yourself of dying from boredom, although no one will probably read this its a good way to vent.  Speaking of the fact that no one will ever read this I could say horrible things about my friends and they'd never know!!!!!  HAHAHA!!!  James your a smuck with a big nose and Conrad no matter how tall you get you'll always be stunted in growth mentally and Ryan i ripped you fingernail off on purpose and Sarah you bit me and are exasperating and and to that little punk at VBS who kept hitting me if you ever touch me again I'll break those stubby little arms!!!!!! HAHAHAHA!!!!  Well that was fun and a good way to blow off steam, so most of those things are lies except for the part about being bit and conrads brain.  Oh well its been fun you crazy cats!  Goodnight!

        Well,  this here will be my first post on my very on blog.  Makes me kind of proud actually, kinda like having a baby or something.  Not that I'll ever know exactly how that feels, thank God, but more in the sense of creating life.  Even though it is in fact an inatimate object that has no real life or purpose, but thats ok!  I'm still proud of my little guy.  Tell me what you think!
