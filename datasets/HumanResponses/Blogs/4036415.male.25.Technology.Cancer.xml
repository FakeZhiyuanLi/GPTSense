        Without going into the dilemma of chicken and egg, how can we... &nbsp;  Too often we hear the use of the term 'chicken and egg' to describe a dilemma or paradox, where the occurrence of both A and B are dependant upon the existence of each other as a pre-condition. Not very surprisingly, too often this term is also used as an excuse in many&nbsp;loosely constructed&nbsp;arguments.   Which one existed first, chicken or egg? Like it or not, there is actually an absolute answer to this question. It wouldn't be so hard to realise that&nbsp;the world must have had an egg&nbsp;before we had a chicken if we think logically, carefully and scientifically.&nbsp;   Modern science theories tell us that all living things today are&nbsp;products of generations of evolutions from single cell organism. The first chicken on earth, like any other creature, must have come from a close species, probably some kind of bird-like being.&nbsp; Let's name this 'bird' a 'pre-chicken' for the sake of this discussion.&nbsp; The difference between a chicken and a pre-chicken is arbitary and is of no importance. Regardless of&nbsp;the criterion we use to differentiate a chicken from a pre-chicken, there is always going to be a boundary that we have to draw between these 2 species.   Now, one day a pre-chicken must have produced a chicken egg, before&nbsp;the first chicken in the world can be hatched. Of course, you can argue that this egg might not necessarily be a chicken egg. However, such argument would have ignored the fact that a non-chicken egg would have produced something else, probably another kind of pre-chicken,&nbsp;instead of a chicken. Based on this simple yet conclusive deduction, we can very confidently claim that an egg must have existed before a chicken.   Chicken and egg, it's far from being a dilemma!

        I am witnessing an unprecedent wave of 'bloggelisation' among my social circle.   First there was the all-time favourite, always-enthusiastic, ever-ready Mr Chew. Then like an epidemic, one by one I see my friends 'enlightened' to join this bloggers' community. I can't help feeling puzzled - what in the name of Satan is this&nbsp;mystical power that draws everybody in? It's not as if we might eventually gain something out of&nbsp;scribbling a few purposeless words, is it? The thing that surprises me most is - those friends who join this community actually stay in the community. Blogs after blogs they post, throwing my initial impression of a temporary hype thingy straight into the recycle bin on my desktop.   Well, perhaps it's time for me to fall victim to this new age religion. If you can't fight them, join them. After all, that's the best way to understand what's in it. So fellow blogvirus-infected dudes, prepare your armor! Draw your sword! Raise your shield! For I am charging at your direction.  (LOTR??)   I know it is hard to imagine someone as dull as myself to publish a blog site. To tell you the truth I suspect this may well be the last blog that I ever post. Meantime, while I am trapped in my workplace, glued to my pathetic little semi-comfortable chair  (When the h*** am I going to get that nice leatherish-looking director chair in that glossy room around the corner?) , feeling extremely bored,  (by bored, i refer to my refusal to do the work that I am supposed to do, maybe that's why I am out here instead of being in that glossy room)  maybe this is the only less boring thing for me to do.   What a lovely Monday evening ...
