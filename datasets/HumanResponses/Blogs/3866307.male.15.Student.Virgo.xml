      So as i have too much time and too many things i don't want to do..... I've started a blog to pass the time more.. Not really used to typing out what i think for the world to see, but we'll see. So um yes.. for this first post i'll just copy some song lyrics of songs i've been listening a lot of lately.. All are by a band a good friend of mine lent me a cd to. They're called Copeland.. Check them out if you get a chance, or if you um know me well enough i guess, i'll copy a CD their cd of them for you.. good to listen to late at night when&nbsp; you're feeling low.. anyways, here's the lyrics..   Copeland: Beneath the Medicine Tree   Song: Brightest   If you find yourself here on my side of town,  I pray that you'd come to my door  and talk to me like you don't know what we ever fought about.  I don't remember anymore.  I just know that she warms my heart  and knows what all of my imperfections are.  She says that I am the brightest little firefly in her jar.    Song: Testing The Strong Ones   There's an angel by your hospital bed desparate to hear his name on your breath.  As he looks down you're not making a sound.  Open your eyes and look at me.  I'll bring to you whatever you need.  I'll tell you I'm sorry that I can't take this pain away from you.  I'd put it on my own body if I knew how to, can't you see?  I've got to bust you out of here somehow.  I've never seen your heart this tired I've never seen your spirit held down.  I know that you say, "this is what you get for being a bad child."  But I know this will be your reward in just a little while.  It's testing the strong ones.  It's scarring the beautiful ones.  It's holding the loved ones one last time.   Copeland-SecondStartotheLeft, Go Until Dawn   All this time away from you with you would be better all those days of summer fun missed you more than ever I sit still till high school whether but ponder still you know I never will stay silent it was a big mistake to let me had my way in the first place it was a big mistake to let me memorize your face I'm jealous of you moon tonight you get to see her alone beneath the stars and everything I fear all my strengthen was tranquilized and everyday I get weaker but stronger when I think of how we never sat silent it was a big mistake to let me had my way in the first place it was a big mistake to let me I memorize your face   &nbsp;  &nbsp; Yes.. it was a big mistake to let me memorize your face  All for today..

      First off, Don't Ever be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help if you really need it. The hardest thing I believe we do as humans is admitting to ourselves that we have real problems and faults, and accepting our faults and other's faults. We put up so many defense mechanisms, rationalize so many things, and go to extreme lengths just to have a reason not to admit to yourself your problems, mistakes, or faults.  And then accept them.  And accepting them is the hardest part. I can easily name out many of my faults, but accepting them and working through them is the hardest of all. We so easily Judge others constantly to make us feel better about our faults.  Constantly.  For us as human beings, its impossible not to.. Its in our nature, but once you let those judgments become either apart of you, your life, and your  actions  is where the trouble begins. I've come to affirm to myself to try extremely hard not to judge others because I've realized so much that  You can never really understand ANYTHING until you experience it for yourself.  Again for I believe this is emphatically important, You can never really understand ANYTHING until you experience it for yourself. You can never really know about something until you feel it. Until you've felt what they've gone through.. Until every being of your soul cries out to that person for their hardship whatever it may be... Whether they're going through that hardship now, have, or will. For me, some very important events deeply altering my view on life or not life I should say made me come to realize this, and I feel this will be the same for anybody reading this.  For this statement in itself is Rhetorical.  What I mean is, you can't even TRULY understand this statement, until some life altering event makes you see it so, but maybe this'll help, or maybe its just my rantings. So as I've said before, in truly understanding this, I've affirmed to try as I might to not judge others, but what do You the reader care? For we only truly want whets best for ourselves eh? So then, I leave you tonight with a charge to though you may not understand or care what I'm talking about, Keep it in the back of your mind that the unkown is there. That you Don't know what other people have gone or are going to go through, so be nice to them. It may make all or part of the difference as it did mine.  ~CQ
