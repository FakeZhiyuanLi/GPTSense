      Hiya! haha.. you guessed it! i move my blog.. and this time.. it won't be public property No.1! haha.. way too many people knew my other blog add.. so.. haha.. must.. hush hush a bit of my personal life there.. the real stuff and in-depth stuff can come here! haha..  haha... anyway... just some basic intros again lah... hmm... ok... well... i am just a 17 year old aquarius guy who is simply studying at a JC... haha.. which JC? haha... the best! ACJC! haha... yeah anyway, simply love sports... especially... yup you guessed it! BASKETBALL! haha... indeed i am just a mere 166cm (damn short lah! crap!), but... i still strive to do my best... so... now... i even have my own team! it's called, 'Ling Li'...  anyway... am now in the ARTS faculty! it's fabulous here at the school... though, of course, presently it's the exam period... so... STRESS!!! haha... but honestly, i hardly study... so... nothing much lah... haha...  hmm... well... i am just blabbering right now... so... just moving away from the intros...  die lah! i am down with so many injuries! back, ankle and my shooting hand is now... grr... all injured! my middle finger has been like 'jammed' for the darn long time lah! haiz... and my back... it only hurts if i really overexert myself lah... but... it HURTS! damn it... but... nevertheless, i still must strive and work on!  haha... besides that, school is merely exams right now... and... well... the just over hols... were simply not hols lah... they suck lah... CCAs, studies, etc... i mean... it's so unlike Sec school... but... haiz... i made my choice, so i've got to live with it! haha...  ok... anyway... my personal life... not much is happening lah... regarding Kelly and all that... let's just give it a break lah... i mean... i seriously have no idea how she really feels about me... and... i might give up... but wo bu gan xing... really have feelings for her... but... what's the point at times when the person you like... is unsure... or... not so responsive? anyway... i just have to say that... Meiyi, is still in my mind i guess... not that, i intended it to be... but... it was Kelly that helped me forget about Meiyi, or somewhat... but now... with Kelly being so... tentative in my feelings... Meiyi is still... hmm... important in my life lah... but... let's not dwell on it... though i can say that, in reality, the person whom i hope can work out with is still Kelly lah...  well... hope i can study hard leh... the rest... will say in future... so... for now... Live Life To The Fullest! and being optimistic! ;p

      Here i am, questioning myself yet again... but that we'll wait till later, where more shall be explained. Anyway, today, we had a full dress rehersal! haha... ok, so perhaps, the whole thing, wasn't really great, but at least, there were no major screwups and Sujuan and i actually managed to hang on and simply worked together! haha... Shared lots of jokes and and had quite a lot of fun... haha, i think the best and most entertaining part was that of the performance 'sleeping!' put up by feelow ACSIAN Jonathon Khoo! haha... it was damn funny lah, the way he simply fell asleep! haha... but oh well, Sujuan and i videotaped it and well... haha... had a good laugh along with Kelly, Jiade and Gary! haha... so funny! *snigger*  Ok, so now, back to the many topic; Here i am, drained, both physically and mentally. Physically, simply cause we spent so much time working on the pieces and tired from waiting at times, and oh... for having fun! haha... Mentally... simply cause i had to put on a false front the whole damn day. Yup, certainly false front. I don't know since when, but a wave of depression and sadness hit me, and well, i guess it showed early in the morning all the way till PE. PE allowed me to release whatever negative energy that i was running abundant on and well, it lightened that feeling of... i don't know, erm... Anger, fear, misery, frustration, jealousy, CONFUSION... yeah... but, after that, i guess, many of my friends grew worried and thus, we their care and regular jokes, i lightened up and i guess... put on a front so that they wouldn't worry so much...  why am i feeling like that?! i don't know honestly speaking... damn, i feel so tired, don't feel like continuing, but nevermind... shall try... now addressing the topic... i think it's quite easy to tell what am i talking about... Chris & Valarie, at least knows and understands what is it all about lah... but, basically, now i am at a lost, really at a lost... so many paths to take, yet so afraid to take them. Fear of falling, fear of losing all that i value... all that i know... all... that... i... love and like...  Waiting, what exactly do you mean by waiting? i honestly don't know anymore... to wait there like a dimwit with absolutely no sense of direction? to wait there with passion, forever being optimistic? or... to wait for a period of time, knowing that it is hopeless, yet trying so hard, struggling, to get and earn what you or i want? i don't know, which 1 do i fall into anymore... i used to think that it was the 2nd one, waiting so passionately, never once letting any obstacle to bring me down or make me feel so low... yet now, i feel lost, not knowing which direction i should take, where and how am i supposed to wait. Simply put, tired... Honestly speaking, i do carry lots of hope, but sometimes, there is a cause of wonder... Wondering whether i am waiting for a hopeless cause, just wasting my life away? Oh wait, wasting is not the right word, as waiting for this particular reason is special to me. However, i do understand that, all may come to lost, but... i guess, i will just say this, for now at least, i will wait passionately, wait and give with whatever i have... though... it may come to naught... no matter what, i will always be there for that special person and reason... of... LOVE? LIKE? i'll leave it to your hands to decide what i am feeling. Ultimately, all i can say is that the reason why i am waiting, is simple. The person has grown to become a very special part of my life and that, i don't think it's ever to go back to my old self or normal life with her out of my life.  Yup... ok, another thought... am i also feeling cause recently i haven't been putting enough time or spending enough time with GOD? i think that it plays a part too... However, i guess, right now, i just want everyone and anyone to pray for one another and wish their on friends and family to remain strong and supportive. Especially me, whom i want to pray for the safety and happiness of my friends. The need of saving of my parents into the Christian faith, hopefully it would come soon. To friends and family who are always there for me, i pray to GOD and thank him for them for being blessings in my life. To others that have been there one way or another, thank you! To everyone... God Bless! Let's all have faith in GOD and pray that he clears our mind and empowers us! Take care to all! and... Keep that optimistic spirit! :p

      Wow! what an eventful day! haha, but since it's running late and i am feeling incredibly famished! i shall not go into the specific details! Damn it lah! haha... so many things happened! And, beneath the laughter... i am actually feeling really vexed and upset, but shall explain furtheron...  Anyway, today, we had our 1st MEGA concert practice, and well, haha... damn it lah! My erhu, along with Gary's got left in the bus lah! Everything was like this big drama and a big hooha was played on! Crap! Our erhus were left on the bus simply because we were all late, and the rest of us were busy heliong moving instruments, while the person in charge of brining our instruments down thought that someone else would bring it down lah! what kind of responsibility is that?! Anyway, we searched for like an hour to no avail only to find out that the erhus were left at the damn bus at the last minute! by then, 1/4 of the rehersal was finished! And well, Gary arrived, so we 'suffered' together! haha... Eating while everyone was hard at practice, sleeping and joking when we were meant to be practicing! haha... yeah well, we kind of felt guilty, so we decided to sub 2 other people from playing! haha... Unfortunately, Sujuan was along with Jon Khoo and she kept complaining to me about him at the end, but you didn't hear this from me! haha... anyway, Sujuan and i than pretended to be a married couple, and yes it was done in fromt of Kelly, but it was all for the nature of fun ok! So don't anyhow say! haha... but, it was quite funny lah...  Well, i felt really bad when Kelly kept on getting Jacked by the rest of the CO, and well... i guess, i went to help her, even though initially i joined in lah, but... i kind of hurt to see her like that lah, like she had nothing to protect her against... so yeah, i went to help her, arousing many pretty weird looks... but... i heck care lah, she's more important than what other people may think! Anyway, i don't know lah, i am just going to say i am person with lots off emotions and that i simply like her alot, but feel so drainined, so confused, so tired and not knowing what to do...  Ok, i really need to go eat liao lah... but, let's just say this lah... Kelly, i hope you understand why i do things sometimes and that in time to come, you'll realise what and how i really feel! To the rest! and... haha... To Kelly too... keep smiling! Take care! :p

      Heya! haha... today, was a relatively interesting day at school! haha... oh well... but, i don't know what to say and how to erm, narrate it lah, so shall just leave it as it is... haha... ok, i went for bball training today, and well... i can feel my confidence rising again, cause, i think i am learning from my mistakes and covering more on stuff already! haha... but oh well, i think it was quite fun when i pulled a trick on some people and it shocked some people as i made a great pass! haha... ok...  Haiz, i still can't get over my late ah Kong, after so many months, the feelings of sadness, misery and just plainly, missing him... is still there, somehow or another, everytime i see some elderly men smiling or simply just walking around, i would recall the days whereby i went out with my Ah Kong, shopping, playing board games, and just simply having nice long chats with him... i really miss him a lot... somehow or another, every thought of him would bring tears to my eyes as recollect and simply, wish that he was still alive... i will emphasise more in future...  heex... the only happy thing though about today is... i saw Kelly! haha... heex, had a brief conversation with her! haha... but anyway, i am really worried about her, considering that she just 'recovered' and yet, went for training lah! That silly girl! Kelly, take good care of yourself ok?! please... cause, i feel uneasy whenever you strain youself! Anyway, with regards to your GP and other tests! Relax lah! Don't worry! i am sure you'll do well! Have confidence in yourself! Place your trust and faith in the LORD!  ok... i need to go eat dinner liao! take care everyone! keep smiling! :p

      Yup, as i put in my topic today, it's just going to be a really short entry today... Basically, i am really tired, have no idea what is going on at times in my life, all i have is 1 clear focus right now, besides studying i mean... and that is of course, with regards to Kelly lah... not that much is happening, but of course, i do wish that things would go well...  Anyway, why do i sound so sian today?! Well, cause, i really feel sian today! man, it's like, Chapel was the only thing that i was happy with... i mean... besides receiving a message from Kelly lah... haha... that, was another matter altogther! haha... but, let's just say, i was damn happy! haha... ok... anyway, the whole day was so monotonous, things went on like they usually do, nothing much interested me except the occasional gossips, scandals that were going on around... haha... i sound like a girl right? Can't help it lah, just damn bored at times lah!  Oh well, work is getting heavier as the days go by, and i seriously need to get down to my acadamic stuff lah! If not, i am really chopped liver! heex... ;p Somehow or another though, i can't seem to get my spirits up unless i see Kelly or get a message from her, but how often is that?! haha... ok, i seriously sound like some lovelorn person and even Yong Xi said that i was some love sick puppy! Is it that obvious that i really miss her so much? i hope not leh... it seems as if, she has become the epitome of my happiness and joy... the center of my life...  ok... yeah well, i really am feeling quite tired right now, and just got home not very long ago! haha... Finally heard from Chun Yan lah! Wah, he missing from action like don't know how long liao lah! So nice to hear from him again and nice to know that he cares! haha... ;p oh well... but anyway, i really miss some people or rather, wish that i could like hang out with some friends that i haven't been hanging out with much recently... but, we'll see how it goes in time to come lah...  till next time though, i am going to study hard, work hard and basically... just... keep trying and waiting for you know who lah! heex... ok... take care every one and keep smiling! ;p

      Hiya! Yes, what do we mean by committment? Have you ever asked yourselves that? i don't know about you, but i certainly have! And, after a long time, i realise that i have to learn how to be committed to certain things and people...  yup! 'Finally!' is what many would say to me, after knowing me for so long, friends would have been lamenting about me not being able to committ myself to certain things for a long period of time. Honestly though, think back and see for yourself, haven't i been able to committ myself to certain things or people? haha... can't say anything more right? Examples? haha... Looking back in time, i am pretty sure that i've been committed to my work, my CCA and certainly, when i was attached, the girl(s) that i was with. Indeed i admit, that though some of my relationships were short, i was at least 100% committed, but... facing many and relentless problems, i had to give them up somehow all except the last one, which i simply had to stop cause, it was just too much for me to bear.  However, with the incoming promos and upcoming SYF next year, i have to take up and put in my committments again, after being so slack for the past 7 months! Haha... yes, i know that i suck big time, but i can't help it lah. The problem though, that has been nagging me is the perception of people who views me as a person who can't stick to 1 girl! Hey peopel, news flash! Perhaps, it's not me, but perhaps it's you guys whom have been giving me problems?! ok... that wasn't a nice thing to say lah, but seriously, i am sick and tired of people calling me things that are not true! Damn it, look at Benjamin, on my tag board, he called me a flirt, but after that, he admitted that he has never even seen me flirting at all! He did it for the FUN of the moment! My friends, do that all the time too! what's the reason?! For FUN! come on people, have you guys ever spared a thought for others? Have you ever thought that you might be hurting the person without the intention too? In case, you don't realise it ah, but everytime i am called that, i do get hurt, pulling myself back further into the shell and shield that i have built for myself... Fearing that people would start insulting me again. Understandably, i was once a very flirtatious and buaya kind of guy, but, are you sure i am still like that? haiz... i don't even understand why i have to explain myself, it's just that there is so many misunderstanding views about me... come on lah, shit... Who in the world doesn't flirt? forget it lah, i am just so tired of this, and i hope that people would understand!  Wah lau! i can't stand it lah! Some girl from my school went to my chinese tuition teacher whom by the way is my aunt and said that i was like... famous lah! Say don't know what, i got a lot of girl friends and than my stupid aunt went to tell my mom lah! wah lau! What is this?! i am innocent lah! Please loh, do you often see me around many girls?! NO RIGHT?! haiz... and please hor, i only like 1 and only 1 girl!!!  I think people who know me would by now know who is this girl, besides, she is so consitently mentioned on my blog... I don't know lah, i just feeling really drained... However, i can say that no matter what, i will stay committed to who i like now, no matter how hard it may be, i won't let anything get me down, nor will i let anything make me give up. I promise even more that i would not be a bloody playboy kind of mentality and go after another girl... All i want now is to convince her that i really like her cause i really do and from than on, see what happens... All i am asking now is that she would at least trust me this bit... To the girl: Trust me ok? i know it's hard for me to ask this of you considering what stories you have heard of me, but know that i won't give up and that i will wait until the day you believe me. Whatever it is, i will stay here and would always be here for you...  Ok... now that i've got it off my chest, i feel much better... To everyone, thanks for putting up with me and my whining! haha... Anyway, friends and pals, do take care ok? i know that everyone of us is facing trouble and problems each day, and i would like everyone to know that i would be here for you as a friend! Especially, for... (you know who lah! ;p) To my friends that are down and out, cheer up ok? There is always something positive to look forward too! If you feel like God has let you down, like how Zhen Yang has put it in his devotions today, he is just not done with you yet! Be patient and simply pray to the Father for strength! Take care everyone and remember to... LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST! ;p

      Alright! Promos, here i come! haha... Indeed, as the name suggests, i am finally bucking up... or at least i think i am, really need to work hard, and today marks the 1st day of my Math tuition, i know it sounds dumb to have tuition, but hey... i really need it ok?! so... don't criticise me! i am like crap lah, only with tuition than will i be motivated to work harder! Anyway, i think i am pretty pleased with myself over today's session, cause, i guess, i was able to understand concepts that i didn't initially! haha...  Anyway, there was a GP 'EXAM' today, and well, it was quite alright lah, but the damn compre questions were harder than usual lah! Wah lau, everything also USE YOU OWN WORDS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE! crap lah... Heex... oh well... but, haha... i think the funniest thing was that after the paper, Hiro just kept bitching about Shane! haha... he was like complaining and whining about Shane shaking his legs, clicking his pen, disturbing Hir's focus and concentration, lamenting about how it would affect his work! haha... oh well... Hiro, i've been there and done that, just try to forget about it lah, it's his bad habit, he can't help it! i've come to understand that, hope you would too!  Oh! man... i realised something too, i was a little bit hard on my friend's ex lah, i am sorry about it. But i guess, i was really concerned about my friend, and i really didn't want to see her so hurt, so yeah... Sorry girl if i made him sound like a monster, but, i guess, in my eyes, he is for hurting a friend like you so badly and treating you so badly... yups...  Anyway, thanks to all my friends who have given me encouragement, i really needed it! heex... felt so down and you guys provided what i needed, moral support! Thanks again, people like Seok, Tham, Benjamin, Chris... yup... heex... haha... Jill, you too! haha... ooh! Nice pic by the way! haha... okok, i better stop jacking her before she comes to kill me when she next sees me, or even worse! Don't accompany me back! :p  Hmm... to that person whom i like so much, i don't know what to say lah... just that, i really miss you lots, even though it has been only 1 day since i last saw you. haha... i know it's crazy, but... it's true... ok... i am not going to say more, except that i hope you enjoy yourself and take good care of yourself! Remember ah! Don't injure yourself! This week got MEGA CONCERT! TAKE CARE! Please don't fall sick too yeah?  Ok, i am done for now... will blog somemore soon yeah. People, don't forget to pray for you loved ones and trust in the LORD! if yo guys want to come to church! Can attend BRMC ok? it's located at ACS(Barker Road)! so yeah... take care every one! Smile! ;p

      Yup, as you can see from the title, there is a tinge of sadness in today's blog. What is it? well... simply put, i screwed up in the basketball game against our seniors! The J2s and J3s! Damn it! Argh... man, i am not going to make excuses, cause i admit that i really played a very bad game.  Sorry Mark, Bjorn, Bing Wei, 'Cow', Deepan, Jiade, Raymond and the rest of the team, especially the specific names above though... haiz... i miscued a lot of passes, made bad decisions and man, i really need to by more calm, because of me as the point guard, i screwed up our communications... really sorry to all of you... However, from this, i have learnt much and will take the experience with me, i promise that i would play better next time and train much harder!  However, i can say that, the illness and sickness that i am under didn't help me one bit, after a while, i felt really faint, and seriously couldn't think clearly... I am so sorry that i didn't think of the consequences, thus being extremely blur and lacked the proper strength and mentality to play properly... yup... Yong Xi, you were right! i became a liabilty to our team, and i can't deny that...  The thing that i was most embarrassed about and upset about is that i made a fool of myself in front of Kelly lah! Argh... it's so pai seh! Damn it! haiz... felt like i really let her down... damn it, i WILL work harder and get everything of mine up, all my basics and stuff, i shall improve... anyway, really sorry everyone, if somehow you get to know about my blog that it... and well... really sorry Kelly, cause, i failed to meet your expectations.  From this though, i know that there are things that i lack, and, i am confident that i can improve! So please people, pray for me and give me time ok? heex... yup... and oh... Please continue to pray for my friend who is undergoing her heart mendning, another friend who was my OGL, Geraldine to get well soon... and oh... Friends lyk Yulin, to get over her depression... Cherie to cheer up and forget all her worries... friends like Benjamin, hey, we will always be friends and i will be here to help you... yup... please pray for everyone you know... and... oh... to all out there! Let's trust in the LORD! Keep smiling! ;p

      Heex! i am so damn sick lah! wah lau, was so tempted to take pink slip, but i was determind to pass Kelly ths present today, so... in the end, i didn't... yup... anyway, i think i might sleep and not study for my stupid chinese test tomorrow anyway! damn it! i want to do well... but... really feeling damn bad lah... yup... at least, i got to see Kelly today!  Haha... yup... today is Kelly's birthday, so... HAPPY BIRTHDAY KELLY! May all your wishes come true! heex... so happy! i LOVE her smile lah! i don't know why, but at least, when she smiled, i had this feeling of xing fu... haha... i bet, you guys who read this must be thinking that i am crazy right?! haha... yeah... well... guess, i really am, crazy about her at least! haha... okok... better stop this for now! All i can say is that, i am really serious about her, so please ah, don't like, put me down and anyhow spread empty rumours and scandals... cause, i really wish that things would work out, and , well... i will... wait for her... *blushing*  ok... that's all for that part of my life, not going to say anymore! haha... anyway, my good friend in X just broke up, and damn it, i am damn pissed with the F****** idiot who cheated on her lah! WTH! She is like, wonderful and great as a person and all loh! Not to mention, she isn't bad looking either lah! WTF! Man, i really sympathise with her and i wish that she would get over the guy soon man... it's like... haiz... she is really fantastic as a girl lah, forever encouraging me and helping me when i was down in X... now, to see her this sad and heartbroken, it tears at my heart... Anyway, hey girl, if you ever find out about this blog, just want to tell you... CHEER UP! if you need anything, just find me yeah? will always be a friend to you... :p  Anyway, yeah... am going to be committed and serious about Kelly now... oh well... anyway, today, something happened in school, in class for that matter, and i guess, it's really depressing in class lah... i really hope tat things would take a turn for the best soon! i really don't like this class, i hate to say this since i am afterall the class rep, but i really don't mind turning in my badge and lessen the responsibilties so that i can be more of myself... than, perhaps, people would be able to see me for who i am, instead of who i am supposed to be, someone that sticks to the job, and more or less, more strict and restricted in front of everyone... but... oh well... i guess, what would help is a class party, so... HIRO! CHERYL! NARTZ! Everyone! HELP OUT!!! ;p  haha... ok... that's all for the moment, but... yup... am going to keep upbeat and try to stay on my feet for now! Take care everyone! once again... Kelly... HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ;p heex...

      Oh man! Yes and as the title or topic of my blog today suggests it, things ain't working out so well! Argh! oh man... 1st of all, i kind of screwed up the presentation lah! Everybody who knew me just simply knew that i wasn't being me and that i was super stiff and restrained! Argh! damn it... however, at least, it worked quite well and we drew a significant number of attention! haha... yup... anyway, another problem! Argh! Chris forgot to help me buy the glitter and glitter pens that i required! Argh! now... i just have to make do with whatever resources i have!  Worst of all, i am sick! yes! Sick! horribly weakened and fatigue right now... damn it... i really want to be well! Please bless me! ARGH!!! anyway, i need to go and do the card and make it as best as i can now! So... HELP!!! chao! Take care! For now, let's just place our trust in HIM! As the sharing goes lah! ;p  But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.   Jeremiah 17:7-8

Even though i can say that i didn't do much, but it seems to be that after Amy's brief visit to the class, everyone is communicating better now! heex... anyway, talking about Amy! it's great to hear from her again! haha... hey, i am sorry for being such a poor host, but anyway, sure hope that your experience here made it fun filled as well as that you have taken something away with you! sure hope to hear more from ya! haha... kind of miss you presence in the school though... like got a missing hole or link in the class now... so used to see you charming face among the 'Charlie Angels' in class!  Anyway, damn it... i've fallen sick again! Argh! why ah?! why is it that i am so particularly weak this year?! I think it's because i don't take as much time to exercise now with school ending so late and with stress piling on me as each day passes! Anyway, sure hope that i get well soon... don't want to miss school tomorrow and end up letting down the CO! I don't know why but suddenly, i have this sudden wanting and desire to make the CO better and bigger... fa yang guan da! I hope that tomorrow's presentation would be a success and that i would be able to draw more people to join CO! *crossing fingers* hey guys! Pray for me ok?!  Oh man! i am so frustrated! Man! Chris forgot to bring the present that was meant for Kelly! Argh! grr... was meant to... nevermind, can't reveal my plans now... but... wah lau... now i have to rush most of the things tomorrow! damn it! but it's ok lah, Chris, after all, i owe you a favour for helping me get it in the end! Oh well... anyway, really hope that can settle and get everything ready by tomorrow! heex... ;p  Kelly! you are damn lucky! i got an OFF for my terms! Man... i need to study harder and work harder sia! Man... haha... okok... i really need to buck up liao! Seriously! Argh! okok... enough is enough lah... really shouldn't whine so much... but can't help it! i pray that Li Feng does well and that the LORD would bless her! She seems so unsure at times, but let's pray that she gets the confidence as the experience builds up too! heex...  Kelly... i hope that her finger is completely healed, perhaps 1 day, you'll truly undertstand how i feel for you... ok... anyway, it might be soon lah... ;P okok... anyway, everyone! keep smiling and take care! ;p

      What an interesting day today! well... 1st of all, i guess, i witnessed a really grand kind of event, the 29th Student Council Investiture! Anyway, it's like how to say leh... i was really upset to see the 28th Council leave, but, as well as happy for the breathe of fresh air coming from the swearing in of he 29th Council! When i 1st realise that the 28th was leaving, i guess i teared, but thank gosh no 1 saw that! whereas, when i saw Li Feng being sworn in as President, i was sure that it was a brand new era and that everything would be great and exciting things were forthcoming!  However, i was really upset when my friends were bad mouthing Li Feng, she really is a wonderful girl and man, i think she is really swell and would work out to be a great president! Alas, this batch of friends were like saying that she was really bitchy and detached from us, and well, i was really pissed to hear that lah! It's like, they don't even know her personally! So how could they say such things? Ok, understandably that people say that her speech was very sophisicated and was not very, erm... Homely... but i certainly found it fine! Considering that she talks like this all the time! So yeah, please lah guys, give her some time, she is after all new and you should understand that she is undertaking a huge responsibility and has a lot to live up to!  Anyway, no matter what, she has my support and i pray that the LORD would be there for her and just simply bless her with wisdom! Oh well... Anyway, i just realised that i am doing things that i shouldn't be doing under normal circumstances for Chinese Orchestra! Things such as, for this upcoming Wednesday, i am undertaking the duties that Sujuan should be doing, and that is off... Presenting the Chinese Orchestra and their various instruments for Racial Harmony day! Yup! Another speech and another presentation! Damn it! Haha... not that i am complaining but rather, i am really nervous lah! I am doing it in front of the SC combination lah! wah lau! so pai seh! haha... in front of so many friends! and... well... it'll be the 1st time, that people would see Kelly on stage with me too! Man... i am sure going to get alot of things for this soon! Things, as in... Rumours and gossips... haiz...  Oh! Kelly's birthday is coming up... and well... i can't believe it but i kept forgetting what i've been wanting to get her! Argh! Anyway, i kind of asked Christopher to get it for me lah, told him the whole description and where to get it cause i couldn't get the time considering that i've been bogged down by sickness, family events, and well... work... and... it doesn't help considering that my mom hasn't been really encouraging about me coming home late every day with my sickness! Argh! Anyway, there are some more things that i am preparing for her... so... heex... hope it works out lah...  Haha... ok... Anyway, damn shit lah! i haven't been studying so i am like way back in my reading for GP! i am on page 15/45! Super fast right?! haha... oh well... i better get back to it soon... okok... Anyway, i hope that everything goes well... and i really pray that GOD would bless the new 29th Council and give me strength to do my work well! Just a verse that i got today, something to show that God is always there for us! ;p  Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.  Psalm 139:7-8

      Haha... Alright! Finally got through my 1st sharing with the Sunday class! haha... i was really nervous cause, it was the 1st time since i don't know when whereby so many people turned up and inclusion of new members such as Wei Kong, Celine and a few more... Including Lisa's friend as well as Robyn's friend! haha... yeah, well... The J3s joined us too! and wah lau, there was os many people... haha... but... i guess, my nervousness was really uncalled for lah. It was like, i walked up on to the front of the class and simply burst out laughing cause i was nervous, one of the 2 symptoms that i have whenever i am nervous or embarassed... haha... the other, is more disgustiong, but, only happens whenever it is regarding to Sports or Competition... haha... Can ya guess? &nbsp; Anyway, it's like, i was sharing and i guess, i was really dramatic and my nervousness made me like super funny or something lah! Kept on making the class laugh! Oh man! Arghs! hope i didn't make THAT big a fool of myself! haha... but it was good to at least see the whole class laughing together for once lah... heex... Perhaps, i have set the tone or standard for the guys to undertake, i sure hope that we are all funny! Haha... ooh! but i've got to say this! Li Feng (or however you spell her name), Lisa, Celine&nbsp;&amp; Robyn simply have beauty smiles! heex... and please ah, i really don't mean anything, but it was really nice to see everyone smiling... Okok, at the expense of my own face lah... but oh well... &nbsp; However, i was happy that at least the 2 teachers in our class said i did very well... but... OH NO! they want me to do it again! Argh! i am so screwed! haha... but... it's ok, i shall take everything in my stride and give my best! heex... haha... whatever happens, at least i know that i can put my faith in the LORD! ;p &nbsp; Ok... i had dinner to celebrate my grandmother's birthday... oops, i forgot, my uncle's too! haha... But anyway, it was great to see everyone again... but... why is it that every single time we have a family gathering, the center of attraction is me? They never seem to run out of topics with regards to taling about me! HOW COME?!!! haha... oh! i finally got to see my beloved cousin who went overseas to study! Haha... she's still chio lah, but... only the face now... it's really damn wasted, cause her character and overall physical appearance used to be really wonderful... but now, i guess, her weight pulls it all down... but... i still think, she's chio lah... Of course lah! she is my darling cousin lah! wah lau... hmm... but, you should see her when she was thinner, hope that she works towards that goal again! heex... but nevertheless, no matter what, i'll still love her all the same! :) &nbsp; heex... anyway, i have more or less made my choice liao! haha... but... damn, i am still not prepared to make a step towards it, cause... i really am afraid of rejection at this point of time... ESPECIALLY, at this point of time... but... of course, i have to hope for the best and look at the brighter side of things lah! haha... Yup, that's all i can say about this one... But, i have found out another thing... as in, another interesting thing, not about the 2 girls whom i like, but rather about another girl... but this, i promised to shut up, so yup, i shall keep mum about it... the most important thing right now... Besides the LORD, is... to actually, settle my feelings for... the choice that i have made, cause i have realised how much she means to me... so... yeah... &nbsp; To all that are down, Please cheer up... Whatever has upsetted you or got you down, there are always other people around the world who are more upset and have more reason to feel depressed... but... no one is blaming you... However, i just want you all to know this, no matter what is getting you down, no matter what has happened, you will always have a friend in GOD, and... certainly, have a friend in me! So... guys and girls... SMILE! :p

      Hiya! haha... I had Geog lesson today, and man! i woke up late! grr... but thank gosh i reached school early! haha... if not, i am so going to miss out alot of tips and advice! Anyway, was really tired and drained, so not the usual self that i am today! I guess, it was quite obvious to alot of my friends who questioned me and asked why i was so dead today... haha... The answer? Cause, i was drained lah! Literally drained! with 450ml of blood missing from me, what do you think? haha... anyway, i am missing my 1st math tuition today thanks to the fatigue and drained feeling that i feel right now... really feel like crap! but oh well, at least, i get to relax and rest right now... &nbsp; heex... anyway, i saw, Kelly today and i feel really happy! Yup, i don't know... it's like, this feeling of joy and just... simply, happiness just overwhelmed me! You know, i never did realise how much i missed her till today? man... it's like, never see her much around school after all, and she didn't turn up for CO, so... yeah... anyway, heard that she injured her finger, sure hope that she gets well soon, so... i am going to pray for her lah... really hope that it'll heal... Anyway, Mega Concert is coming up soon and i am sure that during that period of time, i'll be able to see her more soon! haha... OH! her birthday is coming up on the 22nd! ARGH! i haven't gotten anything for her yet! Grr... don't know what to get her, cause, i've got so many ideas! oh man... but... does anyone have any suggestions? please tell me yeah? &nbsp; okok... anyway, i've been talking to the mysterious girl for a few nights, and... haha... looks like she owes me something now! haha... She owes me a picture! haha... one that includes her in a dress! haha... i know it sounds weird and people would wonder why i would be so happy and amused about it... basically, it's cause, NOONE! and i mean... absolutely NOONE has ever seen her in a dress before, of course excluding the time when she was young and like an infant lah! haha... but nothing else lah... what she read already, come and kill me... haha... but yeah, really happy about quite a lot of things now lah... &nbsp; OH! i am doing the sharing thing tomorrow for Sunday school, and i am a little nervous... oh well... please pray for me and not let me screw up please... pretty pretty please! haha... ok... got to go liao, getting quite dizzy again... :p Smile! :p

      Wow! Today was so interesting! haha... well... today was Amy's last day in school and man, it was really quite emotionally charged in a sense... though it wasn't like there was crying and stuff, but at least there was some sense of belonging, whereby Amy seems to be part of us already! haha... yup... anyway, i guess it's with her presence that also enabled the class to bond even better! haha... It was the very 1st day whereby the class sat together and shared pizza! haha... it was a farewell treat to Amy and i hope that she enjoyed it... haha... so many people were envious of us and the rest of the attachment people kept looking at Amy! haha... oh well... Anyway, i am happy to say that at least out of the 23 people present today, all 23 of us sat down at the same table and ate together! it was something that was only minimally short of a miracle! haha...  &nbsp;  Anyway, with Amy going away, the class would definitely be much quieter and perhaps not as much laughs as there normally would be! haha... yup... oh well... With her leaving us, i hope that she takes back memories, unique only to those that have attended or participated ACS life with her! Anyway, i also would like to thank her for her simple and nice card! yup... THANKS AMY! ;p  &nbsp;  haha... okok... today was certainly an extrodinary day! it was the day whereby i 1st donate blood! Alright! haha... it's damn cool lah! i was the very 1st person to donate blood or 1st student to donate blood and undergo the procedures however, i was the 3rd to finish lah! wah lau... it was really cool! But i guess, it was really scary as well cause the 1st time mah! haha... but anyway, i placed my faith in the Lord and he granted me the calmness that i needed, thus allowing everything to go smoothly, even when they had to search for my viens for a good 5 minutes! haha... but anyway, the whole procedure wasn't pain at all, the only slightest pain would be that of testing your blood type where the pain is like an Ant bite! haha... Audrey was sitting next to me, and well... Rachel was sitting next to her lah, throughout the whole procedure Rachel gave us comfort and just kept us company... something that was realy sweet of her... it is her whereby i understand why did i feel so strongly for her in the past... Anyway, i felt this great sense of satisfaction at the end of the whole thing and was really happy that at least i can make a difference!  &nbsp;  Anyway, i have more or less settled whatever relationship problems that i may have. I do know that right now, i am somewhat still torn between... the 2 most important girls in my life lah... but... at least, i am more or less sure whom i have chosen... but... let's keep it a secret lah... perhaps in future, if things between me and her work out, i'll put it up... till then... let's just leave it as this... yup... ok... Keep Smiling! :p

      OMG! This is damn freaky lah! Today, while having Geog lesson, Mr Lynn revealed something really scray to us! It seems as if, even the teacehrs know all our blogs and read them?! What is the world coming to lah! wah lau! You know how freaky that is?! crap... it means ah... you can't say anything about anyone and anywhere unless you seriously want to die lah! haha... but... oh well... i still refuse to censor much of my stuff, cause... i haven't done anything of the sorts... even if i do bitch about anyone, i tell that person up straight! so... yeah... but to everyone out there, be careful of what you say ok? You don't know who might be reading your blog!  haha... anyway, i am feeling better now lah... cause, at least now i do know more or less what has happened and what has resulted in the relationship or situation between Kelly and me... yup... somethings, i won't say lah... especially, since it's more or less a thing kept between us... but... all i can say is that... at least, i do know more or less how she feels about me... yup...  Oh btw... Chris tagged and said to ignore people who gossip about me... well... i can't really say much about it lah... except that, it's really these gossips which are for good old entertainment that may have cost me from having a serious relationship... Thank you very much! Please lah... i don't mind if people gossip about me, but serously, don't take it to far... and to those who have committed this offence... be careful or watch out! if i find out who you are, i seriously don't think i will let you go scorned free... but... than again... i might... cause... forgive and forget... just remember this everyone! Although gossiping may well be fun and entertaining to some of you, think of the consequences and impact it might have on other people 1st! Not to say that i don't gossip, but, at least, i do know the limit and i STOP!  Ok... that's about it for now except for a bit of whining! ARGH! man... i guess today wasn't a very good day for me at all! From the moment of waking up, till now, i haven't had a smooth time! 1st of all, i woke up late! Half an hour late! than, as i stepped out of the house, i sprained my leg simply cause my mum forgot to put away her shoes properly! Argh! bad right?! haha... ok... next, had E8 and damn i failed my assignment! it fails as if my terms are just doomed to suck lah... i always had hope of doing ok for my E8, but now that i see my assignment, the hope feels so flushed down the drain... Oh well, moving on... i had PE next, and wth! we got scolded for no rhyme of reason! we were playing badminton at the concourse and spilled over onto the road, but... even though we knew it was stupid, a PE teacher said it was ok so long as we kept a look out for each other... a few minutes later, we got caught by another PE teacher and got punished to run 6 rounds even though we explained! ARGH! bloody hell! this was a bad day, anyway... if that wasn't bad enough?! i sprained my other ankle on the last round! 2 bad ankles + a bad back = NO BASKETBALL!!! ARGH... damn it! i so wanted to go for training lah! but... Alas... it just can't be... *sigh* at least i spent constructive time writing the reflection letter for Mr Lynn as i waited for my firend, Jill to complete her PW work, before we headed back together... and... NO!!! There is NOTHING going on between us! When i got home, i got into an argument with my parents over Math tuition... ARGH! what a wonderful day right?!  Oh well... no matter what, we still have got to keep our heads up right?! erm... actually, it would be right to agree... but... i am desperately trying to convince myself too! so yeah... anyway, i really hope that my injuries would heal soon and well... everything would get better... especially with regards to my academics and my relationship aspect! yup... i feel so drained, so tired... how am i going to give my blood tomorrow?! ARGH! i hope i'll be all ok and alright soon! haha... ok... anyway, the thing i hope to work out the most now is my relationship problem... to think that 1 phrase of 'just forget about me' could turn the whole situation around into something that both of us didn't really want... oh well... ok... but, as to who that is concerned, guess lah... i am not giving any clues, so don't bother asking! Yup... ok... Keep your chins up and keep smiling! Live Life To The Fullest! ;p

      well oh well... ok... i really screwed up my damn exams lah! wah lau... i have already scored an impressive result card of, 2 Fs, a B for chinese and a D7 or C6 for GP! haha... yup! wonderful right?! well... i can't help it lah, too pro already! yup! All that is left is to get back my E8 result than my dream of getting 3 Fs will be fulfilled! Damn it lah! wah lau! do you all really think i am that crazy?! Of course not lah! Shit lah... after this results, i really need to reflect! Argh! so now, i am going to undertake tuition for C Math and well, just simply work harder for the other subjects! i really must not slack already! if not, i am so going to get retained lah! haiz... anyway, i really sympathise with Natasha, she studied so very hard, yet, her results were not really satisfactory, but... i wish her the best and not to lose hope but to strive on... :p  Anyway, i just had a talk with Kelly yesterday lah... and well, i am happy to have things sorted out with her. Indeed the results may not be exactly what i have hoped for, but at least, now i have a clearer picture and know what to and what not to expect. Yup, anyway, to all those that have been bad mouthing me. FIND A LIFE! what the hell, non of you know me lah. Only true relatives and close friends are able to tell others what kind of guy i am. Please lah, and i mean, seriously, if you think you know me now... think again! crap lah... it's cause of people like you that jeopadise situations and cause rifts between people! In future, try to be tactful lah! crap... haiz...  Actually, i have realised that i don't really have clear good friends or close friends, if so... most of them are actually younger than me or are already not in the same college as me. In school, i guys perhaps only Timothy from AA1 knows the inside me better than the rest. Come on lah... Perhaps Yong Xi and Michelle Wong too... but i guess they ust don't see the serious side of me.. that... Chris knows that i can be... of course, i admit to being a huge buaya and flirty guy in the past, but... i believe that i don't do it much now... occasional flirtings definitefly takes place, but... most of the time, they are either done unconsciously or done to like... lighten the mood... my dear Mich mei, wo shi wu gu lah! i really never go and buaya with XH loh! you can stop it mah? aiyo... i tell you the full story that i owe you 1st than you draw conclusions can?  Anyway, back to Kelly, i really don't know leh... i mean... ok... i really like her alot, but... i guess, i may really have to give up all the way lah... yeah... though it's not going to be easy... but... not much can be done to change or improve the situation... thus, even though i have more or less made a decision on who the girl is, this situation with Kelly must be entirely solved 1st... before i can move on... and i guess, from here you realise that it's not Kelly lah... i guess, i have already given up hope in the past, but was never really able to get over it...  Anyway, till than... i have really got to study harder! Argh! And wah lau! That Cheryl or is it Sheryl? from AHB ah! keep on whacking me for no rhyme of reason lah! People were given suspicious stares lah! Than told her to stop, she still don't stop! Haiz... to think i treat her so well... *shakes head* ok... besides than occasional jacking lah! i am innocent! Argh! haha... anyway, it's nice to know new friends better, ie... Cherie, Cheryl (Sheryl), Amy... etc... haha... but hope to get to make more new friends and know my present group of friends better too! haha...  Yup... have i said too much? oh well... haha... ok... i got to go liao! wait people say i crazy again! haha... Anyway, i do hope that things would work out well between Kelly and me... and... of course, the mystery girl lah... yup... but... i guess, i really wished at that point of time that Kelly would get together with me... Alas... it didn't work out that way...so... too bad lah... ok... keep smiling! Live Life To The Fullest! :p

      haha... ok... i need to whine a little bit... damn it... school has become such a drag!!! argh! so very tiring, i am just dragging my ass around school the whole day lah! wah lau... crap... and... well... today's chinese oral didn't exactly go my way either lah! GRR!!! reading, had stumbles... conversation had pauses which i knew i could have done without but darn nervousness simply killed me there... damn it... oh well... that's gone anyway...  Another thing that's pissing me off in school? can you guess? it's actually the animosity between Michelle Lim and me lah... i mean... it's not like i offended her or anything loh... but than... i don't like the look she gives me... wah lau... if not for the fact that i treat her as a friend ah, and the fact that she's a girl, not to mention that i am the class rep... i don't know lah... i wouldn't be so composed... or... of course, perhaps i am simply being paranoid... i don't know... but... in reality, i wish that if anyone has a problem with me, just simply bring it up to me... i hate it when people are being hypocrites... damn it! yup... that's what all that i want to whine about right now... except...  MY BACK!!! it's certainly getting better... but... heck, i really wish that it was completely healed already! Anyway, it doesn't matter, i think i am still going to go for basketball training tomorrow. I simply can't afford to miss trainings again. Haha... okok... but... if i really cannot   tahan   tomorrow, i'll just stop and tell the coach. Yup... but... i am of course crossing my fingers and praying that i would be fine lah!  hmm... what else is there to update? i don't think there is much liao. Except that i have not been doing my stupid holiday homework so they have all come back to haunt me! ARGH!!! haha... nevertheless, i must remain upbeat... and... continue... Living Life To The Fullest! :p

      Haha... it's nice to hear and have people who are concerned for you... Thanks mei, thanks Cherie n hey... Thanks Chris... you're a pal! heex... yeah well... unfortunately though, my back still ain't feeling that much better... damn it lah... i don't know how long it'll take... but... i will perservere and keep going on, praying... so that with HIS help, and with me doing my part, i will get better soon...  Indeed today as i headed down to church, i realised alot of things. There is so much that i don't know, so much that i can learn about GOD. I once thought that there wasn't much to being a Christian, just needing to read the bible, go church and be a goody too shoes... but... i am wrong... in life, you don't have to be a goody too shoes, but... rather, there is so much more... there was a question posed to us today, and it made me reflect... are the things or rules/goals that the church set for us, human-centered or more GOD centered? ever thought about that? i never did, not till today that is...  I realise that many of the things that we think, much of what the orders given to us are more human-centered than being GOD-centered! Is this right? if not, how do we change our ways? how do we truly move towards a more GOD-centered lifestyle? Let's take a time to think of 1 example or question each... I pose this question, are the goals and rules that we follow according to what the church laid down for us, buman-centered or GOD-centered? Thought about it? And... are we following it cause it's the RIGHT thing to do? Or is it cause we really want to glorify the LORD'S name? Think about it? and perhaps pose your comments...  Anyway, it's surprising what you can find out with each brand new day... Such as today when i learnt new things about my close friends Chelsea... yup... not meant for me to say nor divulge, but i've learnt many things... even, friends whom i've known for years... with each day, i learn more about them! so... what have you found out today? we are all on are road of discovery...  Ok... i have finally figured out whom i really feel for.. but... i shall divulge it when i am more confident of doing so in future... till then... Take care and keep smiling! :p

      hmm... here's a time of reflection and thinking... after the terms and 6 months of JC life has passed, there is much to think off and reflect upon... indeed, juring this point of time, much has changed!  From the transition from Secondary school to that of JC life, not only academic stress but even stress from CCAs has increase tenfold! Normal daily homework coupled with CCAs has made life hectic and at times depressing... haiz... i don't know... i guess, really had to fine tune myself at 1st... finally after 6 months, i have finally more or less gotten used to JC life... waking up early, going through the whole day of school, ending of school at 430 all the way to having CCA to latest 9+... it is now a common and simply part and parcel of my life... truly, it's not as easy as it seems... certain points of time, i tend to crack under the pressure and strain, fatigue sets in and i simply blow! An example? just today, during E1 lesson, i just blew my top and slammed Brian's stuff on the table simply cause i was frustrated... yup... i guess, i scared some people with the sudden outburst and i apologise about it... REALLY REALLY SORRY! Sorry...  Anyway, besides all this, there is the need to change of attitudes, behavior and action in the mix school... after 10 years of single sex school, stepping into the era of mix school was 1 hard process for me. Actions, words, behavior had to be toned down, disabiling me from being the real me. Indeed, there are times whereby i wish that i was still in the single sex school system, but... nevertheless, mis school has it's merits! One of which is that you get to be more open minded about many things and get to understand the opposite sex much better. Well, for one thing, i love this system now cause, i've developed a more sensitive side of me... knowing the dos and don'ts in front of girls, giving me the chance or rather the knowledge of coping with the real world in future!  okok... enough enough... well... Let's move back to the present. haha... Michelle was really scared that i jio Xiang Hong lah! haha... wah lau... am i that bad?! haha... well... all i said that i liked Xiang Hong's blog and she was like, 'You like Xiang Hong?!' wah lau... come on lah, my dear mei, i am not that bad lah... and please loh... do you think i really am that much of a casanova... i admit i was once like that lah... but... i really am not like that in real life lah! it's just a fake side of me! grr... okok... anyway, no lah... it's not like i don't think Xiang Hong is bad or anything, in fact i think she is a wonderful girl! but... nah... i don't think things can develop between us besides just good friends... that's all! aiyo... so... please hor...  haha... ok... another thing! please lah! i am not like some super flirt lah! haha... those stupid friends of mine ah... all i did was say hi and talk to... ok... quite a number of girls... and they were like... teasing me all the way lah! wah lau... guys, GROW UP! grr... hmm... furthermore, Valarie is my good jie mei lah... so... yeah... don't anyhow say lah! wah lau... in my heart... i only got 1 true person... but... i am not going to say it here lah... it's really simple and actually, if you are observant enough... it's damn obvious... so... yeah... let's leave it at that lah...  okok... that's enough... erm... Oh yeah! Amy is quite sweet lah! i don't know why i said that, but... yeah... she seems that way... and NO... please ah... don't start scandalising me again... i just think she looks great and is really quite a fun person lah! haha... while we were having PE, playing soccer today... she was damn ON lah... until she got tired i guess... than, she, Cheryl and Audrey simply stood at the goal post and refused to budge as well as refused to open the goal up bigger! grr... but nevermind, we still drew with 3 guys vs 11 girls lah! haha... anyway... yeah... she seems like a great girl! ok... that's it i guess with regards to her at the moment... never did spent much time talking to her yet... cause... so busy lah...  hmm... ok... what else? nothing much lah... but... simply wish to make our class bonded together soon enough... i mean, if it means embaressing me... i don't mind... cause... i believe that class bonding is really essential for a condusive studying environment! heex... also hope that i can be the Chairman or president of the Chinese Orchestra... ok, i got to go liao... hope to make more friends and know present friends better to! Peace! (that was so lame!) Smling day in, day out! :p

The girl by the way is called AMY, i think the surname is Kwok... and well... she is 18 this year and studying J1 standard work! erm... what else ah? haha... oh yeah! she is in Geography society and also in Library, both of which she is a committee member... she plays the violin in her school ensemble as well as is in the chior! wah lau! she is how pro lah! i don't know how they can cope with it! grr... i am jealous! than our stupid chinese teacher... a relief somemore! made me do an introductory of ACJC, Singapore education as well as an introductory of myself! bloody hell! so pai seh lah! i was so nervous, i kept giggling! grr!  omg! i almost forgot lah! i had CO interviews today too! it was interview for the next year committee and i am pretty sure that i did quite well for it... so... hopefully... i think... i can become the president again... yup... but... i was prett confident for the interview which helped me alot... and considering the number of interviews that i've gone through so far already... yup... the experience certainly helped! haha...  haha... okok... enough enough... need to watch my show liao! haha... Chinese! haha... ooh! hope to get to know more friends soon... heex... Living day by day with smiles! Staying happy! ;p

      WOW! Spiderman 2 ROCKS sia! cool lah! haha... i think the CGI was really good and besides, there were some really cool jokes! even though there are times that i got really pissed with the fact that they got alot of the facts wrong, man... the whole show on the overall was really fantastic! haha...  Hmm... what can i say lah... Kirsten Durnst is really good looking lah! and wah lau... why in every Spiderman show, there is showing of her... essentials?! damn it... can get people's mind to wander one ok?! haha... anyway... really realise how much i miss the company of my secondary school friends especially people like Shawn and Zhi Wei! haha... Rating is damn fun and a well missed activity that we always do... but... it's good to do it with you guys again!  haha... wah lau... Zhi Wei, don't monk us lah... we all know the truth lah! haha... Shawn, i buaya?! haha... no lah... somebody in the middle of the movie also can spot girls ah?! haha... just as we were watching fighting scene somemore! wah lau!  haha... anyway, the jokes in Spiderman 2 are also quite cool lah! haha... like the lift part where Spidey converses with the guy about his costume... haha... 'it looks uncomfortable', and spidey simply replies something like, 'it's ok... just that it rides up the crotch at times'! haha... anyway... still go the part where he jumps over the building screaming... 'I'm back! i'm back!' and falss to say... 'ow... my back! my back!' haha... i think the show has an equal balance and something for other movies to learn from! haha...  heex... Rinoa chio right?! haha... yeah well... wish that i could be as lucky as Squall and find someone who loves me or rather... someone whom i can be with like Rinoa.. doesn't have to be as chio... but... i don't mind! haha... no lah... just want someone whom... aiyo... i can't explain... nevermind... haha... okok...

      Haha... I am so happy lah! Yeah well, at least, really overjoyed but with a little bit of problem at the back of my mind lah, but shall address it later! haha...  Ooh! Why am i so happy?! haha... erm... cause, i guess... i saw Cherie today! heex... yup, was really happy lah, spent some time with her and i guess, things are progressing lah! However, i am not going to say how and will not go into the details, it's only for her and me to know lah ah! haha... Heex.. Bleah... so happy!  Anyway, going to keep this entry really short lah, but certainly have to address some issues and problems in my life.  1st: Chris, i have a feeling that you are angry with me. Though i don't really have any clear idea as to why, but i can pretty much guess that it would most likely be related to Kelly lah. I don't know, at least you give me that impression. Well, i won't deny that alot of the things that has happened shows this view and conception fo me that i don't like, but at least, i prefer it than to release the whole truth and stuff lah. Yeah, but i really hope that you would tell me anything if you are unhappy with me cause you're a very close friend to me that i guess, i don't really want us to have any problems relating with each other. Yeah cause, i guess, we have a friendship that i would like to keep for life, but with the way things are going, it's going to be hard. So yeah, just tell me if there is anything wrong lah, and i hope that after 4 long years of friendship, you can actually just be honest with me.  2nd: To Kelly, i don't know... But i guess, there is this sudden awkwardness between us in terms of interacting lah. Yeah well, i don't know, but i guess, it bothers me lah... Yeah... You're a really special friend to me and i don't really like the way things are going so i do hope that you can at least tell me if there is anything long. So please, do tell me if there's a problem lah...  3rd: To all my classmates, i am sorry that i stepped down as class representative, though i know that some people are just faking their concern, but i do recognise those that honestly are concern and i thank all of you. Yup, i guess, there are many reasons as to why i stand down lah. 1 is cause of the election of me becoming the VP of Chinese Orchestra (CO) and well, i want to concentrate more on that CCA. 2 is that i think others deserve a chance to get the points and stuff lah. 3 is that i guess, i don't really click with the class cause with the responsibilities and stuff, i try to keep away and keep to myself from everyone so now, i hope to be more of myself. Yup... so yeah... Thanks for the support of everyone that has helped me and been a friend to me...  ok... so ends the addressing, however i hope that everyone be optimistic and Live Life To The Fullest! heex... Cherie, i think you know what i want to say lah... :P

      yeah! haha... i don't know why lah! But seriously, my life seems so much brighter! Don't feel as tired except that the day seems longer lah! haha... However, overall, my life has been really great! heex... yup!  Ok lah, i think it's really evident why my whole life has been happier. Yup, it's really a singular reason. Ever since everything has been resolved, and since i made that decision to pick Cherie, my life has been really upbeat and i guess, i really am happy to make that choice. I don't regret it and i will NOT regret it!  Anyway, i realised though that even though, we've been going relatively smoothly, Cherie has been having some fears and doubts as to my feelings for her. I guess, i really can't say much to it lah, i guess, my past history is really working against me for it, but well... yeah, i am going to leave it to her to believe whatever she wants to believe. Won't make a special effort to make her believe cause all i can say is that, what you see is what you get.  Yup! hmm... i don't know, been really worried about it all the time lah. It has been a persistent problem to me and hindering the process of all my relationships... but oh well, i can't really do anything about it right? Can i? Either that or i simply give up on everything lah... however, i really do not want to do it, cause i guess, she really has come to mean a great deal to me and i can't afford to lose her... But, yet again, i am leaving it to her lah.  Ok, i should stop being an ass and just start working lah! i have been slacking lah! Wah lau! If this goes on ah, i will die for promos! I really better start working hard! heex... anyway, Cherie, i am not going to say much as to with regards to our situation but i really want you to know that i am being true to you and i really hope that you would trust me in this... cause...  i really... Like YOU alot... in fact, more than anything than i can say lah... ok... this is so embarrassing... *blushing* But yeah, i guess, i never am going to regret making this choice as you've made my life more meaningful as compared to before, so yeah... I... Love... You...  ok, i so am not going to do that ever again lah... but yeah, just had to say all of these now before i live to regret it... heex... Everyone else! Smile and take care! Live Life To The Fullest! :p

      Heex... ok, so i am much happier now that things are more or less finally resolved and to know that things would be easier right now, since an understanding has been made. Well, of course, that is leaving out the damn 7 essays that are left for me to complete, the PW stuff and man oh man, CO stuff...  Heh heh, at least now though, i am leading a happier and more light hearted life. Certainly i know that some people view me cruel, emotionless and i guess, heartless. However, i guess to these people, i know where there are are coming from, but i just hope that they understand all that's going on 1st before judging me... yup...  Anyway, the thing is that, though i am not really absolutely happy with the decision i made, i certainly am glad that i made it now. i have no regrets cause, at least, i do know at the moment more or less, the decision that it's heading towards. So yeah...  Well, the decision has left me happy cause at least, for this relationship or at least, somewhat like it, everything is transparent and honest. yeah, it makes it much easier for everything and i am thankful for that. Hmm... oh well, anyway, there are some things that she said that really made my day and though i met some troubles and stuff, in the end, it's what she said that kept my spirits high! heex...  Ok, anyway, i shouldn't be saying so much right? Yup, i guess, i've also finally made the decision to step down as Class Representative, too much stress, too much problems with school work and CCA, so yeah. To friends and pals that have been supportive to me throughout that period where i was the Clas Representative, THANKS! I'll still be continuing my job for the period till they choose a new one. But yeah, i won't say it was really enjoyable but it sure had it's ups and downs lah.  However, i do know at least that at my side, there will always be someone that i can rely on. That is God! Yup, He who has made my life beautiful by showering me with many blessing such as blessing me with knowing Kelly and Cherie. Yup...  So to all out there! Trust in the Lord you God, and lean not on your own understanding! heex... Take care ok everyone?! Especially to Cherie, do take care of yourself! You ah! Hurt your leg! Please take care ok? If you need anything, i am always here! Smile everyone! :p

      Yup, i guess, i've finally made my decision. Don't know what will happen with the decision, don't know what the consequence would be, don't know how it will end, but... i had to make it.  Ok, so it goes like this that i finally found out what i meant to Kelly and the truth behind everything from Kelly. Thanks Kelly for being honest with me and i guess, i wish that it was known before all these happened than things wouldn't have been this hard and complicated, but at least, that's done and over with now. However, i hope that you understand whatever i've said in my mail to you and that hey, your happiness really does matter to me. Hopefully, this whole episode won't change our friendship cause it matters alot to me.  Cherie, i guess, there really isn't anything that i can say anymore except that you've got to trust me now. Certainly i guess, with all these, it's going to be hard, but i pray for you faith. Yeah, so well, thanks for being there for me even during this whole period of confusion and reassuring me that things would eventually work out and that i would be able to make some decisions in the end. Well, all i can say is that, right now, i just wish that we get to know each other better before anything really happens lah.  But i guess, with all these statements, it is clear what i've decided. It hasn't been easy, it has been really hard. One decision that continued to cause turmoil in my heart and mind but certainly one that i won't change now. So yeah...  To all my friends that have been there, thanks. To God most importantly, thank You for being the ultimate friend and everything to me. Yup, i can't say much else now, cause, of the reflections and many things that occupy my mind, but at least now, this whole thing is more or less behind me and i've got to move on.  Take care everyone! Keep smiling! Especially to Kelly, do take care and hope that we'll be friends forever! Cherie, you really got to take care of yourself ok? i am really worried about you, please take care! Smile and hey, be joyful! If you need anything, i am always here for you (this applies to everyone else too)! ;p

      Well, as i've said during the past few days, so much has happened and there were so many confusing thoughts floating around in my mind. But at least, now, i've more or less made up my mind.  However, 1st of all, i would like to thank all those friends out there whom have helped me and giving me advice as well as criticised me.  To Michelle, thanks for being a great friend and simply for giving me advice that made me think and made me realise that i had to be more down to earth and stay grouned to reality. Thanks especially cause i guess, we've not being talking as much as we used to.  To Nartz, thanks for being there and just for listening to my problems, your presence and lively deposition in much appreciated. Yup, and relax girl! You are like, super stressed! But thanks anyway for being a friend.  To Wan Yi, thanks for offering that listening ear, but remember what i told you before all these happened? Yup, believe in that, cause i guess, that's the decision, but keep it to yourself 1st yeah. Take care lah! Forever getting sick one you!  To Shawn, thanks for being my cu qi tong, letting me let out my negative energy all at you. It was much needed and you couldn't have come at a better time. Thanks.  To Yong Xi, hey man, thanks for being so down to earth with me too, keeping me sane and giving me sound advice whenever i needed help and simply for noticing my mood swings. Xie Xie Ni.  Ok, back to business. I've thought much and i guess, with Kelly and Cherie talking to me after that, i've sorted out more or less all that i feel i needed to with regards to this problem. Sure, the decisions and ideas were really hard, but i had to make it, didn't want to hurt both of them in the end. However, i've kind of made my decision for serious lah. Heex... and i guess, i am contented and happy with it, though there is a part of it which hurts cause of that decision. Alas, that's life ain't it?  I wish i could really choose both of them, but, it's not possible is it? Besides, i am pretty sure no one would like to share that other person with another would they? Kelly, i know that i've been a jerk as to what has happened so far, but i guess, it's to late and it doesn't matter anymore right? After all, that's what has been said between us so frequently and so recently right? Haha... i wish that was true though, it certainly did matter to me with regards to everything, but, i guess, i just had to respect whatever decision you made at that point of time and hope that it was the best for you and you would be happy in it. Wasn't it our agreement that at the end of it, so long as we were happy with the decision or with what we did, than everything was right? haha... sad ain't it? I am not entirely happy with the idea, but, i don't find it to be entirely right either, but i guess... nevertheless, it has to be this way, i am still waiting, waiting to know what is it you really think and feel... but i guess, with you saying that it doesn't matter, i would never find out will i? oh well... Just wishing you the best in everything that you do and that you'll be happy with everything then... i guess, that's how it's going to end right? i don't know, but, it's up to you...  Hey Cherie! Thanks so much for being there for me, and most of all... for believing in me, you certainly are special to me and i hold you close to my heart. thanks for being everything that you are to me. thanks... Take care of yourself ok?  Well, that's all i can say now, other than that, i'll tell the consequences and the truth to everything when the time is right i guess... till then... everyone, take care and keep smiling! :p

      Yup, as the title suggest it, i am lost and confused all again. Wrestling with feelings of past and present. What shall i do? What can i do? Does anything i do matter anymore and what can any of it change?  Argh... i am lost... really really lost and confused right now, the light seems to be snuffed out, there seems to be an overcast shadow. What can i say? A feeling of hopelessness, a feeling of depression has now crept in to fill whatever i have felt. yet, somehow, at the bottom of it all, i have joy and happiness... Confused? yeah will, tell me about it.  So much, has happened, all the way from the time Kelly told me, 'just forget about me' in June, to now. So much, just so much... so tired, and just so confused... With mix feelings and new thoughts, i really need some quiet time to think and reflect.  To Kelly, i guess, what i really wanted to say is all in that E-mail that i just sent to you today. Why? Why didn't you just be honest with me? I didn't know, i really didn't know. Argh... i really didn't need you to be so shy with so many 9it doesn't really matter' when it mattered so much to me and you, but why didn't you just tell me the truth? It might have made it so much easier for everyone. I am NOT blaming you, just that, i wish that you could have been more honest with me, you could have trust me.  To Cherie, i guess, i can't hide my feelings for you and this forever, so yeah. Anyway, i don't know what to say, except during this shot period of time, you have come to mean alot to me and that you made me special, made me happy and have been there when i needed someone the most.  Well, to all of this? i really don't know anymore, both mean so much to me and i can't deny feelings for either of them, especially to Kelly i guess. I just don't know, feeling so lost, yet in my heart i know that Kelly doesn't really want to care anymore. But damn it, why does it all have to be so complicated, so intricate?! Argh, i just want to die now, or just shut myself up as i consider and ponder over everything. Yet, in my heart, even though i know that both of them matter alot to me right now, i guess, i don't know who is it that i would really choose. I am so very sorry to both of them.  Both are so special to me in their own ways, yet, Kelly, i don't know, i just wish you told me much earlier and at least, made me clear as to what was going on before i jumped to my conclusions. Cherie, i just don't know what can i say right now, but, i can simply tell you that, you mean a lot to me too, perhaps more than i realise but i really can't say much as to what i feel now cause i need to think. I just hope that everything would be cleared up, waiting for a final answer to everything from Kelly. Kelly, i hope that this entry or any previous entires wouldn't cloud your thoughts or affect you, cause, right now, all i really need from you is to be honest with me.  Friends and family, please forgive me, give me strength and let me know what you think privately.  Lord, i ask for strength and the clearity of mind, please open my eyes and let me choose and be able to make the correct decision according to your will. All i need now Lord, is Your guidiance, Your strength and the wisdom that You can beseech me. I pray that everything would be sorted out in the end and that it wouldn't dramactically affect the relations that i shared with anyone. Amen.

Vice President lah! What else?! haha... oh well, guess i've been expecting it for a while liao, just that at times, i've been so preoccupied with wanting to be the President and scared of being the secretary!  Oh well, that's settled, Lance the president and Wee Keat is the other Vice President, but... oh well, all 3 of us have to work together right? Hmm... i'll try lah... At least, i will keep my end of the bargain with regards to the CO and stuff lah ah...  Hmm... well, ok, that doesn't bother me much lah... haha... ok, anyway, i need to address something lah... It's to Kelly, and please ah, people, don't start again! i am getting really irritated already! Kelly, i don't know why, but when we started talking to each other today and stuff today, it seemed really awkward, i guess, in part it's due to my problems and it's my fault, however, i really hope that what has happened wouldn't affect our friendship and our communication. Yeah, cause, i guess, i still treat you as a valuable friend lah, and i wouldn't want to lose a special friend like you... so yeah, cheer up and please ah, don't feel like so awkward when you see me lah! You were like shying away lah, and not only i realise that loh! lol... yup, that's all i got to say for now...  Jill! Keep things that i tell you to yourself yeah! haha... somethings, other's shouldn't know, as in, yeah... haha... and please lah people! Stop scandalising her and me together! We are not together!

Hmm, well, i just was wondering how are you doing yeah... how was your test? haha... anyway, good luck for your bio test tomorrow yeah! You better study hard! haha... and please ah, take care! Your daddy already promised to help me take care of you hor! so yeah, please take care of yourself! haha... anyway... yeah... that's all lah...  Hmm... oh yeah, there's so much to say lah... haha... but, yeah, i can't be really open in this blog, so the person concerned would actually know what i am talking about and i guess, understand everything in a better view lah ah! *winks* ;p  Ok, just want to say something to the rest of the new committee in the CO, all the best guys and congrats! Let's work together and bring this CO to greater heights, cause... The Best Is Yet To Be!

      Wow! Haha… I am really happy today! So much happened or rather, many things seemed to happened today! But, hmm… really happy that these things happened anyway! Haha… heex… today, spent the whole day outside and had lots of fun! Haha…  Went out to Cherie’s place today to ‘study’, haha… oh well, that certainly happened didn’t it? Well, I went there and ended up, pretty late and well, in my panic, I pressed the bell cause actually also because my dear friend Wan Yi gave me the most vague descriptions ever! Haha… than I ended up walking all the way the stop facing Bukit Pangang Methodist Church lah! Wah lau! What an interesting walk man! Walked up and down until Wan Yi saw me and I saw Cherie! Haha… it was a great feeling seeing them! Heex…  Yeah well, proceeded to ‘study’ but in the end, we went out to Bukit Timah Plaza and on the way, we met Chris! Haha, invited him along cause… heh heh heh… ssh… however, he had to head to school 1st so he joined us later… but anyway, ended up playing pool and man! I really suck lah! Wah lau! The 2 girls thrash me like don’t know what lah! Damn it! Bleah… oh well, Chris only came at the end lah! Wah lau! Damn it! Haha… bleah, but I think Cherie is really quite good lah! You go girl! Heex… ;p anyway, hadn’t had so much fun since I don’t know when also lah! Haha… just kidding around and stuff! Haha…  I think the best part was when we started playing with the chalk lah! Cherie used the cue to poke me right at the forehead so I had this dot right in the middle… heh heh heh, here comes revenge, I rub my fingers in the chalk and wiped it on her face lah! Haha… than wah lau, note this, NEVER EVER disturb girls! I was soon attacked both sides by Cherie and Wan Yi, leaving both my cheeks with streaks of blue! Damn it lah! Haha… but it was fun lah! Haha…  Anyway, we back and Cherie and Wan Yi nearly pushed me into the pool lah! Wah damn heng I managed to hold on! Haha… oh well, we went on to study… but, Wan Yi soon fell sick so I had to do her Chinese work for her, though it was pretty fun to do… Chris was working pretty hard, though he looked so frustrated! Haha… and, Cherie? Haha… well, SOMEBODY just refused to start on her studies lah! And SHE has a test tomorrow! Man… Girl study hard lah! Good luck yeah! All the best!  Anyway, headed off to meet Gabriel for a swim, but just as we were reaching his home, I remembered that a guest was waiting for me at home, so now I owe Gabriel one! Hey man, I owe you! Sorry!  Haha… ate one of my favourite dishes! Curry, erm… buoakolok or something like that lah! Haha… oh well, it tested really fantastic lah! Heex…oh oh oh! Haha, I was actually in charge of breaking the shells before my mum cooked it! Haha, guess what?! Haha… I actually hit once shell such that a love shaped sign appeared on the shell surface! Cool eh?! Haha… what to do? Haha… I am just too good lah! Haha… *ego*  Anyway, overall, it’s a great day today lah! Hmm, I guess, there are a few things I would like to say about everything though… 1st of all, Thanks Chris and Wan Yi for being great sports! Haha… you guess were really great to hang out with… Thanks Gabriel for inviting me! Haha… will swim you some other time yeah? Most probably after your damn prelims or ‘A’s lah ah?! Haha…  Most importantly, thanks Cherie! You really am a bomb lah! Thanks for inviting me to your place and making me feel really wanted! Heex… thanks yeah?! Haha… I owe you one… anyway, hope you like the card! Do take care ok?! And please for heavens sake, EAT! Don’t get gastric anymore cause you refuse to eat lah! You so thin already and than you still don’t eat, you want to die is it? Please take care of yourself ok? Seeing you in pain, hurts me leh! Thanks once again for being such a great person! All the best for your test and enjoy yourself!  Oh! i do NOT look like a monkey lah! Wah lau eh?! May be at times, but, that's basically the way it was shot lah! wah lau, looking at my hand band, give me some credit lah! Wah lau eh! haha... anyway, so nice... Missing... already... oh well...  Hmm… well, that says it all… To everyone out there who’s down? Well, remember this, friends are always there for you! Trust me! I know, that’s why I am able to tell you all these, cause I know the strength of friendship and certainly the power of GOD. Cause, without GOD, would I have been able to meet such great and wonderful people? I don’t think so, so everyone who’s down or happy alike, have lots of fun and place your faith in the LORD! hmm... i would like to thank GOD especially for Cherie to come into my life at the most appropriate time in my life! Keep smiling! :p

Oh well... i don't know what to say with regards to how i feel right now... sure there is still a feeling of disappointment but hey Yong Xi, you were right about what i should have done in the beginning, but oh well... at least, now everything is clear right? haha... anyway, i am not letting this get me down, life still goes on and at least, now i am clearer as to who might be more important to me... haha... shan't say... but anyway, i think GOD was the true way to my present happiness and consolation, sure am feeling great after i prayed to Him, he has healed me in more ways than one! haha... so yeah, thank you Lord!

      Ok, so i guess, the title says it all... i am hurt, yup, hurt... guess, it hurts the most when you like someone that much... hell, i didn't even realise that i liked her that much, but nonetheless,that's life right? disappointments... life is rife with it, it's something that we can't control, something that we simply can't evade...  Well, what's the disappointment? it's about Kelly lah... just, yeah... had a chat with her and found out all the answers i needed to know, so yeah, guess with the disappointment, there is no need for me to point it out right? but, it's so easy to guess... oh well... to be honest, i am not shocked, just that, i didn't realise that i meant so little after so much... but, who can blame her? who can blame anyone but myself... i guess, the only person whom should be sad for me... is... me... no one else is at fault, except me. The pain though, is so very raw, one that i can't control... simply feel like crying, yet i can't... haha... ooh the irony of it all...  Anyway, thanks Kelly for letting me know all that's required. It certainly eased off all my confusion and uneasiness that i felt. Pain came but it shall go, life it but like that, a repetition of events and feelings at times, happiness and sadness... sadness and disappointments come and they will go... eventually, this feeling of pain would go, but, it shall leave a mark, reminding me of all the good times that i've had... but leave the bad ones aside... so yeah, if anyone is worried about me, don't worry! i will be fine... remember this, i have a motto, live life to the fullest! i won't be down so easily and i certainly won't be out so easily... guess, from this however is that i can embrace a set of feelings that i've had for... more openly and without much worry... but, i shall not dabble in that so soon, as the pain is still there, my heart still throbs with pure unspeakable sadness... but... it shall pass... in time to come, and then, i shall revert back to the Colin that everyone knew with an optimistic and everlasting cheerfullness is life...  So yeah, Kelly, don't worry about me... there's really no reason for you to worry about me... i shall be fine... however, though i may be detached and just simply not as friendly for the next few days, please forgive me... yup, but i shall be fine within a few days...  To those that know the other information, not regarding this but the other secret i have... i guess, this pretty much settles the fear that some of you may carry yeah? yeah well... leave me be and give me some room to sort out the rest of my problems 1st, i guarantee that i will bounce back better than ever...  Thus with this, it's the end of but another chapter in my life... Cherie, now hope that you understand what i mean by there is so much to live for, like you, i have gone through much disappointment but i am NOT letting it get me down... hope that you too don't let anything get you down, cause... i think you know why...  Take care everyone! Smile on behalf of me 1st ok? Live Life To The Fullest! (",)

      Alright! Today had church and finally felt quite like good... yup, don't know why either, but i guess, learnt and thought about more things that made me think clearer. Hee hee, such as? oh... well, such as things like GOD, studies and yup... my love or personal life too...  Heex... ok, let's start with GOD, throughout the whole week, i've been down and out with many problems, except that of meeting Cherie and stuff lah, but basically, was so bothered and pre-occupied by so many things that i realised that i've been neglecting the one person that would really care for me... GOD... yup, He was always there when i needed Him, i told Him everything, He knows everything, confided in Him, yet these days, i just simply ignored His importance and presence in my life except for the times when i needed Him most... However, with church and everything today, i have been made clearer to all everything that is going on around me... Towards friends, people whom i care for dearly and certainly people whom i have feelings for... GOD made all of them, and each of them plays a part in my life, some bigger than the rest but ultimately, everyone is important in my life... especially, people like... nevermind, i shall not continue that sentence... however, to friends out there, i know that many of you are having problems... So, i'll just say that i will be here for you...  To people like Wan Yi, take it easy girl! If things were meant to be, it would be... i will try to help, like Cherie but, that's all i can do, the rest, is up to GOD, in the end, it may not work out, but hey, at least we all tried right? So cheer up and don't let it affect you so much!  To Benjamin, dear pal, we've known each other for quite some time, and naturally, i am quite worried about you... Don't always keep things to yourself, let loose you problems and confide them in your friends, i certainly for one would always be there for you to tell and for advice... Cheer up yeah, don't let it get you down...  To Chris, i guess, of all people, you are the one i misunderstood the most, well... i just want to say sorry 1st, for misunderstanding you with regards to a certain person in my life... but, anyway, i know that you have confusions and am facing a dilemia, however, i wish that you could treat the rest of us more like friends... do share whatever problems with us, we will help, i think it what most of us at church would like to say... ie, Wan Yi, Benjamin and certainly me... but do cheer up and know that your friends are always there for you...  To Shawn, hey man! Cheer up old buddy! Don't let people like her get you down, if she doesn't appreciate you for being such a great person to her, than forget it, there are many of us out there who cares for you, so take solace in that... just remember what everyone has told you before, if she is not worth it, than leave it... do cheer up, and move on with life...  To Gabriel, dude, cheer up! i know how you feel, i've been there and done that, but still, life still carries on... just concentrate on the task at hand ('A's) and everything will fall into place eventually...  To Kelly, thanks for being a great and special person in my life, certainly, i am still confused as to what i am to you... but, i won't let it affect me anymore, i guess, all i am saying is that, though i may still like you, i will leave it to your choice... no, not really giving up on waiting, but rather, just leaving you to be happy... i guess, my consistent whining and stuff, may have put you off, but i just simply hope that you mean that much to me... yup, just wish now that you are happy and would be safe... do take care of yourself yeah, can't bear to see you hurt nor can i bear to see you down and out, irregardless of what reason... study hard! your dreams are still within your grasp! don't overstrain yourself yeah... hmm... yup, can't think of anything else, though i can say that, i will be here for you 24/7,if you ever need anything... i think you know the drill... just take good care of yourself, there's so much to say, yet it's so hard to say and tell you... simply cause, i've no idea, what is going on anymore...  Last but certainly not the least... Cherie... heya! thanks for being such a lovely person in my life... i don't know what else can i say to you, but just simply, keep whatever i said to you a secret between both of us yeah... shared with you some things that i've not told others, so yeah... heex... other than that, will tell you over the cause of time... right now, just want to thank you for being perhaps the nicest and sweetest friend i've had in a long time... yup... heex... erm... don't know what to say lah... but oh yeah! Don't you dare try to get yourself killed while i am still alive! there's so much to live for, i am sure you know that by now... so do take care of yourself and know that i am always there for you! Smile! :p  Oh well... that's that for now, but i can assure to all those friends out there, if they or you ever need help, just simply count on me yeah... i will help you all as best as i can... do take this period of holidays as a time for rejuvination as we gear up towards the promos! Jia you and work hard everyone! :p keep smiles up high in the air and bring out your joy! ('o,')

      Yup yup yup! i have gone through some thinking again! And yup! Finally sorted out some thoughts that i was meant to long ago! Anyway, i guess, most of it was regarding studies while the rest were related to my personal life lah... as usual, blah blah blah...  Anyway, i had Geog lecture today, and during the whole thing, i realised how much i had missed, how much i needed to study, certainly, there were lots of people out there that were putting so much more effort than i was! I had better buck up if i were to do well! Yup, so i am really determind to do better and so... STUDY HARDER!!! Really must keep telling myself that sia!  Heex... another thing, i am sick and tired of the politics that is happening in the CO already! Man, Lance damn it! Grow up! We all know what is going on, so don't bloody hell walk around and flaunt your damn knowledge lah! It's like, he is so full of himself at times and always acts with false modesty! it is so irritating! Wah lau, even with regards to his results, pretend he forget than slowly pretend pretend and tell you he got B, A, A, A! Yup! Definitely good results but come on lah! Don't have to 'kae si' until like that right? And that's it lah, i am washing my hands of what position i am going to take at the CO already, President, Vice-President, Secretary, anything lower? i don't want to care anymore! Crap! Just let them do my job and see how it goes lah! I don't care anymore, i'll just do my best in whatever position i get lah... oh well... my love is towards the CCA and not the damn people around me! Nor the position!  Ok, anyway, Kelly... yup... it was the thing that was kind of bugging me the whole period here... i was dispirited, sad and depressed... Certainly, i won't deny that 1 of the reason was because of this ongoing confusion as to what is it that we really have between us... but no more, i will not really want to bother so much anymore? yup, it's a question, cause, to be honest, i am not really sure this is what i really think in the end... so yeah... i am just so tired, so unsure, so confused... simply so vulnerable... not knowing what to do, whether to go on, just so... damn... drained... with an excrutiating pain of dispair overwhelming me... not, it's not Kelly's fault... it's simply my own hopelessness that's driving me to a corner... oh well, all i can say is that for now, i will simply be here for her, waiting silently and passively for her... cause, i don't want to get myself burnt to badly anymore... heex... To Kelly, what can i say, i guess in the end, i failed you... committment is a thing that i am prepared to do, but, right now, it's simply up to you... will wait for you, certainly will wait, till the day you tell me it's all over, that there's no hope... till then, i will always be here for you, a friend... or... anything and anyway you want me to be... Just take good care of yourself and keep smiling! the letter, just somethings that i wanted you to know, just in case, i lose faith in everything... yup... Be HAPPY! :p  Here's another part of my life... Jill, thanks for being a dear friend to me, forever hearing my problems and lending a listening ear... what can i say? Perhaps it's precisely these qualities that made me have a crush on you in the past, but alas, it's all gone... now, i just have a few things on my mind... Particularly studies, CCA and of course, my own, LOVE LIFE?  haha... To Cherie, let all that we shared be a little secret of ours yeah! Don't make me so super embarassed by telling everyone hor! heex... thanks for making feel so happy whenever i am with you, whether by going out as a group, messaging or by the phone calls... thanks for being a great person and certainly, someone special in my life! To the end of this all, once everything has been settled, you shall know everything that i actually want to tell you yeah! Keep smiling! And don't you dare die on me, remember our agreemement!  Take care all my friends! If you have any worries or problems, cast them all unto the LORD and know that HE is always there! Keep smiling! *CHEERS* :P

      WOW! haha... it was a really interesting day! Certainly, much has happened today, but i am too tired to go into the intricate and specific details... Anyway, it happens this way such that it began with a National Day celebration which was damn dead till it reached to the singing part with Mr Patrick Sum, Mr Mark Ng as well as Mrs Chia i think, but then, the moment it hit the 2nd song, everything was like quite hype and many of us ended up singing and standing up on the chairs letting our hairs down! The teachers did it too! haha... by the the end, almost everyone was up on the chair! haha... it was pretty enjoyable to see the AC spirit flowing through! Let's go ACJC! :p  Anyway, after that, a group of us went to buy the gifts for the J2s, i think at the end of it all, we picked some really cool gifts lah! haha... but anyway, the highlight of the whole thing wasn't about the gifts buying... oh! but, i did get to know a new friend! haha... Dawn from BRMC and my school! She's in J2! haha... she really has a lively deposition that gives you a comfortable and bubbly feeling! haha... anyway, it's really nice to know her! haha... the MOST interesting one though was that of Lance and Jill lah! haha... so scandalous! haha, i know it's not really nice of me to say this, but aiyo those 2 ah! I tell you, super cannot take it lah! everyone was like, oh man, those 2 are, really like couple lah! Wah lau! haha... so yeah, i think i made a huge statement there lah!  Ok, anyway, here's another thing... went out with Benjamin, Wan Yi and Cherie today! haha... they are really a fun bunch to be with and hang out with lah! It made me realise how little i am having fun as well as how long a period of time it has been since i've been myself... but anyway, made new friends too, Christy, Debra, LiQing (or something like that), Mary-sheryl (something like that lah)! haha... Yup! so nice to make new friends! haha... but as usual, i was the butt of most of the jokes we cracked, guess it was SCD (Suan Colin Day) again! But anyway, it was really nice to know more about Cherie yeah... haha... she has a lively and hmm, i don't know, this infectious character that helps you to be cheerful and happy around her! haha... and damn it! She's 166 lah! Same height as me! GRR!!! ok, moving on, anyway, do hope that she comes to our church soon lah! haha... good to see her around more often!  Ok, here's addressing Kelly and to all those around there yeah! 1st things 1st is that, i am not blaming you (Kelly) for anything! i am not unhappy either, certainly at times i am depressed and down, but nevertheless, i am still happy that you are my friend! so yeah, don't take it as i am blaming you for anything and neither do i wish to see you thinking that i am unhappy because of you yeah... But anyway, Kelly, all i can say is that, i don't expect anythng really, i just hope that you do know how i feel and that you'll know that in the end, no mattter the outcome, i will always be a friend to you! Do take care of yourself and have lots of fun! That's all that matters to me, your safety and happiness...  ok, i think i've become rather long winded recently, but anyway, take care everybody! To my friend who has been depressed over that stupid girl, just forget her and move on, she's not worth it! to my other friend, don't give up! You haven't even tried anything yet! just wait 1st after the 'A's than do something! heex... to the rest, i am always here for you all! Take care and smile everyone! (",)

      Oh man! this really sucks man! Wah lau eh! it's like... grr... i can't take it anymore! My bloody results! Why am i whining, screaming, jumping up and down with anger?! cause...  I was meant to be the confirmed CO president! Argh... yup! You heard me! The president! Man... wah lau eh, anyway, how did i find out?! Ms Too and Mdm Peck told me! So frustrating! Grr!!! Anyway, it so happens that cause of my poor results (thanks to the fact that i didn't study), they had causes for fear that made their decision of wanting to make me president waver! ARGH! Yes! i have to admit! I do want to be the president!  Anyway, what happens now is that, i am now assured a top 3 position in the CO, that means... President, Vice-President or Secretary... but than... oh man! i should be made the president lah! Admittedly, my results ain't that fantastic! But... at least i am seriously making an effort now right?! Trust me lah! Anyway, if i don't make it as the President, i am going to give them my best, do well for my results and show everyone that they have made the wrong choice! Shut their mouths up! Damn it! i am meant to be the President! Argh...  oh well... no point crying over spilled broth now right? haiz... oh well... nevermind, let me just give my best for CO lah... just hope that if anyone else becomes president, let him be sane and not crazily or fanatically over practice minded or else we'll just die! Argh... man... to think that both the teachers were so in high regards of me, and yet, just because of my dumb mistake... my position is questionable now... oh well...  With regards to Kelly? i don't know anymore... very tired, supposed to pass her something, yet haven't been able to get the chance too... oh well... anyway, just hope that she takes care lah... yup... besides that, what can i actually say? i just hope that she totally understands everything that i feel soon... don't actually know how much longer i can hang on, cause, though i will be here for her, just being there for her... but still... oh well... nevermind, i'll just be there for her...  To everyone else, especially people that are down? well... i just want you guys to know, that everyone have their bad days as seen from my above! But guys, don't give up and be happy ok? remember the good times and away with the bad! Know what's been good and forget the bad! yup! haha... or, if you want, just be like me, thrash it out on the court or scream it out and you'll feel better! so yeah... do take care okay guys! If you ever need anything... just find me! Smile! Live Life To The Fullest! Stay Optimistic! :p

      Hee hee... yes, another day has gone by, and damn it! Just another 7 weeks till the infernal Promos start lah! Crap! argh! haha... however, i am so proud of myself! i have STARTED revising my work! All right! haha... i deserve some applause! *clap clap*  Ok, anyway, i don't think i am going for training tomorrow, the damn injuries are really affecting me, and i guess, i want to spend more time with Chinese Orchestra instead and concentrate on it... yup... will explain why later... Anyway, i didn't get to see Kelly today... and man, i felt so... weird, like... oh wait... didn't get to see as in, she didn't come CO lah! Slacker! haha... no lah, just kidding about the Slacker part! but anyway, yeah... something really felt missing lah, really... like, a part of me or something was missing, that's why i guess... i don't know, was a little bit down and di(de) - spirited...  Heex... ok, anyway, let's not dwell so much into that yeah, i am feeling down and a little bit depressed just at the thought of it... so yeah... anyway, CO... why do i want to put more effort in it? cause, i am in the committee... of course, i am not sure what post i got, but i sincerely pray that i am either the President or the Vice-President lah... yes yes, i know, very high aims and quite ego right? but, well, i believe that i will be able to do a great job lah... so, i pray for everyone's confidence & trust!  Ok, some things to take note for all CO members:      There is going to be 2 upcoming performances, 1 is for Lantern/Mooncake Festival at the Chinese Garderns on the i don't know when... but, the 2nd is that of a West Zone 'concert' held at Clementi Town secondary School from the 11th or 12th - 14th or 15th... yup...     There IS practice on this upcoming Saturday! Attendence is compulsory! So... PLEASE turn up!     Next week Wednesday is the handover 'ceremony' with regards to the J2's stepping down, so, please be prepared to stay back late after normal practice which normally ends around 1730! Food and Drinks WILL be provided... yup, so please make arrangements yeah...   That's about it lah, but anyway... i don't know what it means so hoping someone would enlighten me... Yup, anyway... it is like this lah, Miss Too, the CO teacher in charge was questioning me about my results and my studies, asking whether i was doing anything to improve them... than, later on, she let slip something lah... it went something like, 'you must be able to cope with your studies, if not how are you going to be able to manage the CO well!' so what do you think it means? i am quite confused...  Anyway, here wishing everyone a health and simling day! Do take care everyone yeah! To all those Christians: Let's spread our faith and try to save more people! Yup, that's why i have that verse below! Read it and let's spread the GOOD NEWS! :p smile and have loads of fun everyone! To myself, concentrate on your work and study hard man! Remember to perservere and stay committed! ('o,') For, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" Romans 10:13-15

      Ok, so, perhaps, this entry is going to be rather depressing, so... choose wisely, whether you want to read it or not...  1st of all, basketball, damn it, i still can't really gel with the team lah... made so many mis-passes that i am seriously thinking about quitting basketball altogether! Certainly, i am not playing my best, but... nevertheless, it's still highly disappointing at times don't you think?! Anyway, so, ok... only good thing to note, i played better during the 5 on 5 full court game... yup, made a great 3 point shot when i was being blocked and it kind of was a fade away lah... so, the rest of the team clapped for me, was pretty pleased about it... but... coming and crashing back to earth is my darn injuries, i think i really should stop for a while! it ain't helping! Considering that everytime i spped up or force myself even more, the back strains and screams in pain like hell! crap lah...  Anyway, another problem is that of... i have so many friends that are facing love and relationship problems, won't mention names... but, i really sympathise with damn, cause ultimately, i guess, i've been through most of those problems that they are facing... but, anyway, to all those friends that are facing problems, trust me, everything will turn out fine... certainly, it may not turn out the way you want, but, in the end, things happen cause it's part of GOD's plan... so, yeah... don't let it get you down! Cheer up and smile! :p  Ok... here's the thing that is really bothering me! i was really in a conflict during training just now... Kelly got cramps, and when i saw that, i really wanted to go rush and help her out, indeed we were like talking, shooting and discussing stuff... but, who cares about them lah?! i don't know, on one hand, i really wanted to run to her side and help her in anyway that i can... on the other, i didn't want everybody to know and than start jacking her about me... but whatever it is, i was really glad when the coach went to help her! Kelly, i sure hope that you are ok yeah... do take care of yourself, if you need anything, just tell me yeah...  Ooh! i saw my cousin, Hannah today lah! and of course, as usual, weird looks came my way when i was sitting and walking around school with her... oh well... Take care people! keep smiling and cheer up! :p

      Hiya! haha... i can't believe it lah! i am becoming so focused! Argh! Teachers have been asking whether i am alright or not leh! Wah lau! Of course not lah! i am not being myself loh! Having to concentrate more, work harder and study harder, do you think i can be myself?! so yeah, just focusing more on my work, simply ignoring quite a lot that's been happening around me, but i tell you, i can't keep this up... Already 1 day, i cannot  tahan  liao... som i guess, i won't be like so crazy, going to keep my focus, but can't be that anti-social right?!  Oh well.... anyway, it's Xiang Hong's birthday tomorrow... so just want to say... HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRL! May all your wishes come true yeah! Keep smiling! :p haha... anyway, am now working on something that i am doing for Kelly... so, won't make this entry long...  However, all i can say is that i am really tired and drained, both physically and emotionally... ooh! As well as mentally drained... what can i say? damn it... argh... actually,it all attributes to 1 reason and factore lah... but let's leave it! haha... Anyway, really got to go liao! Must study later too lah! Take care everyone! Keep smiling! :P  PS: give your comments about Meiyi yeah, i have a bet with her... so just tell me what you think about her! :p

      Wow! Both events were a blast in the end! haha... why? haha... got lots of reasons but i shall explain later on! haha... so interesting! :p  The Mega concert certianly was a blessing in diguise! haha... Not only did i get to see Kelly in make up for the 1st time ever! but also, i finally got to take a picture with her! YEAH! haha... ok, so maybe to her, it wasn't that fantastic a picutre, but to me, it was really a blessing and i am so overjoyed to have taken it! Ooh! Kelly looks really fabulous lah! wah lau... i don't understand why she is so camera shy loh! She really looks good and stuff, but so afraid to take pictures! Haha... the full feeling of it, i shall not explain but, she will understand in due course. However, all i can say is that with the entire thing, i felt a heavenly bliss, a feeling that i've not felt for such a long time, i have no idea how it felt like till that day! haha...  Ok, the Bible quiz... haha... so, we didn't really win. But i guess, the overall experience was really fun and enriching! heex... so cool lah! i never did realise that we could enjoy the learning and sharing as well as the understanding of the bible in such a fun way! haha... and to do it with friends was even more of a blessing! All right! ;p i once thought it was simply just standing there and answering qs, but i am so happy to be proven wrong! With obstacle courses, running, avoiding being caught by the 'police' and of course! A memory that i won't forget so soon... getting doughed! haha... though we did not win the quiz physically, at least we won in more ways than 1! haha... Learnt to trust each other even more and learned to place our faith more in the Christ and the Lord! heex... really enjoyed myself! Don't worry! We shall take part again next year! and... we shall win back the championship!  Hmm... the only bad thing... Parents - teacher dialouge... ok... so it didn't really go well lah... i had lots of glowing reports about my attitude, behaviour... Helpful, responsible, nice, blah blah blah... the usual things that i have been hearing since Primary 6... but... Not putting enough effort in to my studies! Crap lah! ok lah... guess in reality, it's true... so, well... i am not going to give up, but i shall buck up! Trust me on it! I SHALL!!!  haha... ooh! i finally got a picture of Meiyi in a dress! haha... she looks good lah! haha... but, i will put the picture up another day... all i can think of now is the bliss and happiness that engulfed me with regards to the picture that i took with Kelly! haha... Take care everyone! Keep Smiling! :p
