       San Francisco, CA -  An Al Qaeda plot to drive a van into downtown San Francisco and detonate heavy explosives was foiled on Friday by Shawna Jones, the morning dispatcher for U-Haul in the Potrero Hill neighborhood.  According to Jones, Reza Al Hagwani had reserved a U-Haul van for pick-up early Friday morning.  When Al Hagwani arrived at 9am Friday, however, Jones informed him that there was no U-Haul van available.  "I told the man that we had no vans for him but that we might have one down in San Jose," said Jones.  "I can't help it if we don't get the vans exactly on the day people needs it."  An incensed Al Hagwani stated that he intended to "write a scathing letter to the management of U-Haul" protesting his treatment.  "I cannot believe that even with all the computers at the disposal of these workers, they are unable to deliver me with the van I ordered more than two weeks ago," said Al Hagwani.  "There are many choices to me of rental truck companies, and the next time I will not be calling U-Haul, that is for certain."  Al Hagwani did make the one-hour trip to San Jose to inquire about renting a van from that location, but it is not yet known whether a van was available.

       New York, NY   by Randall Rivers   urlLink      Mr. Rivers    Wassup?!?!   I am writing to you on my brand new Sony laptop, which is real dope. I could barely make enough money at my broke ass job to afford the Internet café, but I won't even bore you with that. Check out what I did!   Ladies and gentlemen, I have figured out how to make some serious coin on the subway. Let me spell it for you. T-E-E-M-Work. Some glass-half-empty types call me a bum-pimp, but what I am doing is creating a union for the have-nots. We’ll have benefits, and paychecks, and hookers, but that’s later, when we’re showing a profit and shit. I'll even rent that blowup rat and put it on the 6 train for a day if I find some dingy bum panhandling on the Lexington Avenue line without letting me know about it. No scabs in THIS subway, boy.  All I ask for is 2% of earnings and in return, you're a Union Man!  Know what I'm sayin'?   urlLink      The 6 Train, otherwise known as the "Home Office"    First off, I rounded up all the fellas offering hungry people a sandwich or a drink. You know the ones who say “I was homeless, and now I’m offering food to the hungry” and you think to yourself, “what a nice man” until you look up and they’re all scary looking. And I’m talking about the sandwiches, before you get the wrong idea. So I went around, and I said to them, listen up yo, noone's eatin that piece of shit sandwich, not least from a crusty old looking guy like you. At least wrap the shit in a Subway sandwich wrapper or something. Make 'em perceeve that it's a tasty fuckin' sandwich, even if it's a raw burger patty, a green pepper slice, and a bunch of ketchup on a coupla old wonder bread slices. And noone wants to take a swig off your 2-liter of RC Cola when they're thirsty. Know what I'm sayin'? Offer the subway riders a frosty 7-Up or something. A toothpick and a mint wouldn’t hurt either, but that’s for laterz, when we've established ourselves, gotten a brand name and shit.   Then, I cracked the battery sellers. It's long been a standoff between the Asians who sell you the duracells, or the loud toys that break the instant they touch a howlie's hands, and God knows what else - and the brothers, who sell the fake duracells which make people say "aw shit, fuckin' con artist" in their brain but their mouths go "thank you, sir." Know what I'm sayin'? Anyway, I took one for the Sino-Brotha team by puttin’ em to work with each other. I'm a marketing man by nature, and my research reveeled that the asians had the access to the real batteries, but that customers preferred dealing with the brothers. Yo, check this out. I got them all together and I said, if you work in teams of two, one handling the cash and the other making the sales pitch, you're bound to double your money. It's working real well so far; sales are through the roof and we've discontinued selling the robots that make a lot of noise. Fuckin' time wasters, those things. We gave em to some little kids charity, and a bunch of letters from the charity have been coming by registered mail. I’m assuming they’re just thank-you letters, so I’ve been throwin’ em out. Thank you's is not why I am in this business.   So now that I got the food folks, and the battery sellers all lined up, I axed myself, what next?  The singers! So I had an open tryout last week. I called it Subway Idle. Man I wish I got that shit on tape. If it wasn't horrible, it was hilarious. The winners would get free outfits, a free backup boombox, and a charming little 5 year old girl (my half-sister's kid) for a week to solicit bigger donations from the straphangers. It went over reaaaaal well. This beatbox kid, real fat, former M&M seller gone "vocal" as he likes to call it, beat out this Hasidic guy in a deputy's uniform and this Hipster for the title. It was b-e-a-YOO-tiful man!    urlLink      The runner-up, absorbing the fact that he'd lost    I’m presentin’ my bizness plan to the MTA next week. I call it “food, commerce, entertainment – the subway ride of the 21st centurie”. I figure if I throw the MTA a bone or two, that second avenue line will get done quicker and I’ll have a new “line” of business, know what I’m sayin’? If approved, look for the peeps in the dark red t-shirts entertainin’, sellin’ and reprazentin’ on a car near you!   Peace, yo.

       Provo, UT  -  In what local promoters are labelling a "communication breakdown", Hollywood-area Tribute Band "Dixie Chicks With Dicks" played a 7-minute show at the Kiwanis Club in Provo, Utah last Saturday evening.  At 8:15 pm, the 3-piece band took the stage - a makeshift wooden platform placed on top of the club's stacked up milk crates.  As they launched full-throttle into the Dixie Chicks' 2002 hit "Travelin' Soldier", the audience roared its approval.  By 8:20, however, a general sense of confusion overtook the audience as they heard lead singer Tom "Emily" Schatz say "thanks for comin' Provo!" in a distinctly baritone, un-"Chick"-like tone of voice.     urlLink       A recent picture of the band in happier times    Closer inspection revealed plenty: three days' worth of chin stubble on all three band members, obviously dark brown roots revealing a crappy blonde dye job on the third "chick", and a mysterious bulge in the tall one's pants. According to eyewitnesses, by 8:22 the mood had soured: those who were not crying uncontrollably were yelling at the band to "leave the darn stage."  To its credit, the band honored those requests, leaving immediately.  "In retrospect," said Schatz, "we probably should have avoided Kiwanis Clubs and the state of Utah in general.  It just seemed so convenient to stop there on the way to Vegas."    Promoters vowed to recoup the $96 they had wired the tribute band's manager three hours before the show.

       New York, NY  -  In a long-anticipated study commissioned by New York City's Center for Homeless Research, the findings have been announced:  New York City's homeless are lazier than they have ever been.  "I remember when the homeless of New York had, I don't know, a certain je ne sais quoi" said Jennifer Skately, 24, of Washington Heights.  "They'd at least crack wise, do a little dance, or just take pride in earning the 21 cents you'd half-heartedly fish out of your pocket.  Now it seems like they expect you to give 'em a buck for nothing else than being homeless."   urlLink      Sittin' around, doin' nothin' - as usual    Quantitatively, it does appear that Ms. Skately's anecdote can be supported.  In a broad range of categories, it appears that the homeless are trying less hard than ever.  All-time low marks were earned in entertainment, creativity, and good humor.  Marks for aggravation, conniving, and public urination have bottomed out as well.  The only statistic in which they receive a better mark is "sitting around and doing absolutely fuck-all."     urlLink      Get up and get a job? Not this guy!     Henry LaFontaine, spokesman for the Center, chimes in:  "It seems that after 9/11, the average vagrant's desire to improve his or her lot in life just vanished.  Some may chalk it up to a crushing loss of hope, attributable to prolonged homelessness.  On the other hand, maybe since garbage pickup has been reduced to twice a week they're all better-fed these days?  I really couldn't tell you.  Nonetheless, I am afraid that the homeless, more than ever, just seem shiftless, bored, and unbelievably lazy."  I spoke with "Joe" (not his real name) to find out his side of the story.  "Man, you go on the Subway and they look at you like you done [had intercourse with] their kids.  It's tough to find a [friendly] face.  And now, with the new mayor not making us go to a shelter at night, it just seems like the other bums got all lazy and [what have you]."  Joe then leaned back against the wall and got comfortable.

       VATICAN CITY  and  GREEN BAY, WI , May 18th  - After 2004 years of praying to our Lord Jesus Christ, humanity had reason to believe that, well, Jesus was a figment of someone's imagination.   No longer.   In a celebrity sponsorship scheme for the ages, the Vatican has announced a partnership program with Klondike Ice Cream Company. After securing exclusive rights to the real-life Jesus for 2005, the Vatican will work closely with both Heaven and Klondike to improve the image of the Church as well as the Ice Cream company's bottom line.   The sponsorship, still in its development phase, looks to incorporate Jesus into a variety of advertisements from TV commercials to print and banner ads. With a rigorous press junket planned shortly after Easter 2005, Jesus is expected to be on Earth for two months before prior obligations require His return to Heaven.    urlLink      Jesus, Our Lord and Savior,  Contemplating a Velvety- Smooth Klondike Bar    "We're tremendously excited to welcome Jesus to the Klondike Team," Marvin Watson, VP of Marketing, said in a recent press conference. "With the recent spate of Jesus-positive media, we felt that He was a perfect complement to our brand. We're excited to see, for the first time, not only what Jesus actually looks like, but what He looks like earning Klondike Bars: you know, doing the chicken dance, rapping in Polish, or my personal favorite, telling off-color jokes."   When asked for comment, Cardinal Abruzzi, Vatican spokesman, stated that "We felt that Catholicism had taken a real hit in the last year with the various scandals. As an institution, the Church was rating only slighter higher than Janet Jackson's new  Damila Jo  album. Frankly, we'd never really lived down the whole "sun revolving around the earth" issue from a few centuries ago. What better way to score some points by bringing back the Son of God? And what could be better than to combine His Holiness with a milk chocolate shell and creamy vanilla ice cream Klondike Bar? I can't reveal too much, but what I can tell you is that you better be prepared for the hilarity that is Jesus doing jumping jacks and screaming at the top of His lungs."    urlLink      If all goes according to plan,  Jesus will be enjoying  one of these shortly    Initial word has Jesus attending the premiere of "Klondike: The Very Last Temptation of Christ" next May at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood as the kick-off to the marketing campaign. There, it is expected that Jesus Himself will make a short "comeback" speech, sit and watch the movie, and then do jumping jacks and scream at the top of His lungs in order to earn His first Klondike Bar in two millenia. He is then expected to make His way over to the premiere party.   As of press time, Jesus was unavailable for comment.    The New Marketing Campaign from Klondike    urlLink

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    In a surprise move, Ralph Nader announced yesterday that he will not pursue a presidential candidacy in this year's election, citing "four really heinous years of Bush" as the major impetus for his decision.  "Man, I really fucked things up last time, didn't I?  I am truly sorry about that," Nader told Meet The Press' Tim Russert Sunday.  "I don't even know what I was thinking.  You guys must think I'm a real shmuck."  Nader concluded: "Frankly, I just did it for a hoot.  I didn't think so many people would vote for me.  But I definitely learned my lesson this time."

       Bloomington, IN -  Mass pandemonium was unleashed last Tuesday when an area toddler grabbed for and dropped a can of whoopass at the Kroger Supermarket on 10th Street.  Bystanders report that the can emitted a loud hissing sound before exploding into a black cloud of bitterness and rage on Aisle 3.   urlLink     Cans of whoopass. "Justin's always grabbing stuff off the shelves and throwing them into the cart when I'm not looking," said Marnie Wolff, the toddler's mother.  "You can bet I gave him a big smack this time."  Assistant Manager Joe Shifflett remembers rushing to the scene and attempting to contain the spill, but says, "I just kind of blacked out after that."  According to witnesses, Shifflett ripped his shirt off and began hurling cans of tomatoes at shoppers trapped in Aisle 3.  75-year-old Judith Martin, who was caught in the middle of the aisle, dropped to her knees and was heard chanting in a foreign language.  Bystander Matthew Pinole said, "It sounded like Latin maybe.  Remember that kid in The Exorcist?  It sounded like that."

      EDITORIAL by Freida Forlane  My favorite restaurant in town has this one very good looking, but very dum waiter. So dum, in fact, that when you ask him to bring you a glass of water, he asks if you want it flat or sparkling. What the fuck, dude? I want it COLD. I don't even know what he is asking me.  Anyway, so I think this waiter has a crush on me because it seems like I get him everytime I go into the restaurant. And it's fine, we usually recognize each other and say hello. If it's not busy, he'll even talk to me for a couple minutes which is ok but sometimes his breth reeks of whiskie or anchovies or something. Maybe it's something else even, I don't know.  Well, all that is well and good but a couple of weeks ago I went there with this boy I was on a date with. We both got the lazanya and it was truely amazing. As always. Well, mine was anyways. The boy I was with complaned that his was burned. And it was, real bad. So we asked our waiter to please return it, and he said it was not possible because it was too busy and there were too many other people who wanted to have the lazanya.  Well this put us in a bad mood. What kind of customer service is that? So I told him I wanted to see the manager. He said something like fan ghoul or something under his breath but I did not know what he said. Besides, I wanted to make sure we spoke with the manager.  I told the manager that we did not appreciate the waiter's attitude and that his breath was not very good, either. I said that I am a regular customer and that I expected him to be fired. The manager said he would look into it, and would my date like something else to eat? He said no, he wasn't hungry anyway since we got like 2 loaves of bread before dinner and he wasn't hungry anymore. I did not see the waiter anymore and I assumed he was let go.  So, anyway, I go back there last Thursday, and the jerk is still waiting tables there! What's more, he did not even look like anyone had yelled at him yet. And he shot me the dirtiest look.  What should I do?

      Listen up, this shit is wack.  Selling M&Ms is no child's play.  I'd have to sell like 200 packages a day - and it had best be 100 of peanut and 100 of plain.  Noone liked the plain though, so my backpack got kinda heavy.  Then I got kinda heavy.  Let me tell you, being a sweaty 12 year old kid on the subway, selling candy - even the little Chinese ladies selling fake duracells were more popular than me.  So we figured a way around it - We'd blow off selling the candy, eat like 30 of them and get reaaaal full.  Then we figured out a nice little tradeoff - trade like 50 packs of candy for a couple of nice stinky buds.  Then we'd smoke the buds, eat a few more packs, and then we'd need to go home.  But momma wasn't going to be too happy about that, you see, so we'd end up just pulling purses out of old ladeeez bags at the Union Sqaure Station.  That would usually get us a lot more than the money we needed for the candy, so we'd either get more weed or we'd go eat dollar burgers at this one place.  I got so fat I had to go to fat kids camp once.  Let me tell you, fat kids camp should have been called "fat white kids camp."  Everyone asked me to do the beat box noises and shit.  That shit was embeeeerassing.

      By Anonymous   So I am probably the only white guy in the United States to work at a Dunkin Donuts. Sure, it means a little good natured ribbing by my darker-skinned friends, but it's worth it. I work with two guys who are named Apu, no joke. Every time I so much think of the phrase "grape squishy" I laugh out loud. Eating day-old glazeds before they get tossed is pretty cool, too.   I think I've proven my worth over the short haul ... I've taught them how to not reuse the grounds three times per pot of coffee, so that the coffee we serve is actually pretty strong. I've also educated them on how asking for milk and sugar doesn't mean a liter of milk and 9 heaping tablespoons of sugar. I have also given them free tutorials on American slang, nothing offensive of course. I've even gotten to them to say "holy cow", which if you're not Indian, is pretty funny. At least they laugh a lot.   Anyway, so how did I keep my job?   This one night a few months ago, these two Pakistani dudes rolled in, all cocky and shit. This was not an evening to even so much mumble the word "Kashmir" for fear of an international incident. Anyway, one of them wanted a Coolatta, which was weird since it was so cold outside. I was so new, I barely knew where the employee shitter was, know what I'm talking about? So you can imagine the scare I had in this totally-out-of-my-league request.   A few minutes later, when I clearly had proven I didn't know what I was doing, one of them was all "come on now, we are not wanting to be long here" in that stilted accent you all know and love.   I looked them right in the eye, and said "hey listen, I'm new here and I'd appreciate it if you'd cut me some slack."   This set them OFF.   In what I later came to find out was a Pakistani gang chant, one of them took out his wallet and threw a five dollar bill at me. He said, “you will be dancing for me, my bitch”. Corporate creed or not, I was nobody’s bitch.   So I went in the back, and after knocking down a stack of styrofoam cups all over, finally got Apu #2 out of the toilet early, had him give me a quick tutorial on how to make Coolattas, and I went back. Despite the jeering from the customers, I worked on it and gave it the ol’ college try.   When finished, I asked the guy if he wanted any whipped cream. He said, yes of course.   So I went in the back, and proceeded to rub one out in the guy’s drink.   The owner - Apu #1 -caught me! He's this really old guy, and I was totally fucked. So I threw myself at his mercy, and somewhere in my rambling it came out that I was just getting back at these Paki fuckers.   The owner laughed and laughed. "Take it to those assholes" he said. I didn't even know he knew the word asshole. He even added a goober to the drink. We high-fived, albeit very awkwardly.   We served it, asked the asshole who threw the fiver at me to give it a try, and he loved it! In fact, he liked it so much that he had his buddy try it. He loved it too! Gulp!!   I got promoted to assistant manager on the spot.   Next week I teach them how to add all sorts of “things” to the donuts. It should be a grand time.

       New York, NY -  The East Village was the scene Friday night of a pitched battle between rival urban tribes for rights to local watering hole "O'Malley's."  According to bar owner Jay O'Malley, the bar was about half full when a large group of "young professionals" in their early 30's came in and occupied the back half of the bar.  "We've got some pool tables and a few couches back there," said O'Malley.  "It gets crowded fast - it only fits about 15 people or so."  O'Malley reported that shortly after the first group entered, another group arrived and proceeded to the back of the bar.  A few minutes later, O'Malley heard shouting and rushed to find out what was happening.  "I couldn't believe it," said O'Malley.  "There were all these yuppies standing there yelling and shoving each other and popcorn all over the pool table."  Debbie Weisman, who was part of the original group occupying the back of the bar, says that they were celebrating their friend Josh's birthday and had been emailing each other all day about a "pool marathon" at O'Malley's.  "We are kind of like the group on 'Friends' - we just do everything together," said Weisman.  "We're practically family, you know?  We used to hang out at Sushi Samba, but when a few of us moved to the Village and found O'Malley's, we decided to make this our new place.  Then these total jerks came in and started hassling us."  Christopher Boatwright, who arrived with the second party, disagrees with Weisman's assessment.  "We've been coming to O'Malley's for five years, ever since we all moved here after business school.  We are here almost every Friday night shooting pool and catching up.  Then these assholes showed up and took our space."  O'Malley says that he told both groups they could either cool down or leave, but neither side agreed to give up seats for the other group, so he told them he was going to call the police.  At that point both groups left the bar.  O'Malley remembers the days when people came to his bar "on dates" or "with a couple of people, max."  "I think all this 'urban tribe' stuff is bad for business.  You get enough of these people together and they think they're entitled to something."

       San Francisco, CA -  In what some are calling the inevitable aftermath of the landmark decision to allow gay couples to marry in the city of San Francisco, spokespeople for Mayor Gavin Newsome are now reporting that divorce filings have logjammed the city's registrar's office for the second week in a row.  According to one source, demand for divorce paperwork is now greater than demand for marriage licenses among the gay community.  "I just thought it would be fun if Mike and I got married with everyone else," said San Francisco real estate agent Jim Breyer, who filed for divorce on Monday.  "We'd only been dating for a couple of weeks, but it seemed like we really had a connection.  Then I saw him at Metro, dancing with his shirt off sandwiched between two other guys.  I knew right then it wasn't going to work."

       Washington, DC -  At a surprise press conference this morning at the White House, President George Bush told a shocked press corps that he had renounced Christianity and had "embraced the teachings of the Kabbalah."  Dressed for the occasion in a white track suit, Bush explained his unexpected conversion by saying that he felt that Christianity was "limiting" and that "some Kabbalists believe that they are the inheritors of wisdom handed down from the time of the Biblical prophets.  I know now that I am in fact one of these prophets, and am thus uniquely able to unite this country and the world."  Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry was quick to dismiss the President's surprise conversion as "an election-year ploy to detract attention from the state of the economy and the quagmire in Iraq."  When questioned whether his conversion was in fact a marketing gimmick to boost his sagging numbers and attract campaign contributions from Hollywood, Bush pointed out that there are many alternative spellings of Kabbalah, the two most common being Kabbalah and Qabalah.  "Sometimes you'll also see Cabala, Qaballah, Qabala, and Kaballah," he added.

      By Molly Wentworth  The other day I was at Lot 21 doing a quick key hit in the bathroom stall when I heard my old roommate Joyce talking to another girl about me.  She said "I just saw a friend from college at the bar - I hope she didn't see me.  Major addict.  I've heard she's turned into a total coke whore."  Joyce, first of all, that was so unfair.  I totally buy my own drugs.  That's an incredibly important distinction.  Second of all, I also don't think it's fair when you say I'm an "addict."  The difference is that an addict  needs  drugs, while I simply  like  drugs.  This is why I prefer the term "aficionado" to "addict."  I don't even have an addictive personality.  Do you remember our junior year in college when I quit smoking for 2 months?  That wasn't even hard for me.  I've also just switched from vodka to red wine.  Wine is full of antioxidants and hardly even gives me a buzz right away.  Just because someone likes to do something doesn't make them an addict.  I recall you getting up every morning to go running.  How would you like it if I called you an "exercise whore?"  I think that would hurt your feelings.  Anyway, I hope you're happy.  I am totally losing sleep over what you said.  I had to take two Ambien last night just to get 4 solid hours, which might not seem like a big deal to you, but now I'm almost out and the Web site where I get them just got shut down.  Thanks a lot!

      By Mike Itskovitz  OK guys, I know you're with me.  I just can't stand it when my girlfriend talks about being on the rag.  The last thing I want to hear when she gets in the car is "these cramps are killing me!"  Talk about shrinkage.  Not to mention the fact that I drive all the way across town to pick her up and then she has to tell me her "flow" is "really heavy."  I definitely don't want to know that she is wearing a Tampon AND a pad!  I'm all for women's lib.  I work with women and I got no problem with that.  I understand that they get their period and there's nothing I can do about that.  I just don't want to hear about it, especially on a date, OK?  In fact, if you're on your period, why don't we just take the night off.  Take a Midol and call me when you're back in the saddle.

      By Paris Hilton  You know that saying - "you can never be too rich or too thin?"  Well I think that's not at all true.  For example, just last month I ate a ton of Twizzlers - I can't get enough of them! and I put on 3 pounds.  Just like that!  Can you fucking believe it?  I am purging this week so don't worry about it, but it was totally scary.  As for being rich, I don't think it's fair that people are jealous of me because I never have to work a day in my life.  Which by the way is also non-true.  I am a professional personality and it takes a lot of work to do that.  I am actually a pretty shy person and it's not easy being "on" all the time for the cameras and whatnot.  So that also proves my point.  Anyway, don't think the grass is always greener on the other side of the street.  When people say that I just think: "walk a mile in my shoes please!"  Between the TV show and parties my life can get really hectic.  So just please stop judging me.  I am who I am and being rich and thin isn't always the key to happiness.  Of course I wouldn't want to be poor and fat but then who would?  I guess the lesson is that poor fat people are sometimes unhappy, just like really thin, really rich people.

      By Brian Sack  You bother me somehow. Perhaps it’s that you litter. Or that you walk in front of me too slow. Maybe you’ve come darting out of a doorway oblivious to the fact there are people on the sidewalk outside. Maybe you spat in my proximity. Or coughed or sneezed without covering your mouth. Maybe you walked diagonally or veered to the left instead of the right. Whatever you did, it bothered me.   It could be the way you stand in front of moving traffic with the attitude. Possibly it was the way you pushed through me to get to the bar. It could be your obsession with designer labels. Or the desperate cry for attention you call fashion sense. It could be that you didn’t say thank you when one was warranted. Or that you failed to say please. Suffice to say, it bothered me.   It may have been the pantyhose on the head with the sideways baseball cap. Maybe it’s because you do not belong in a shirt that exposes your ample midriff. Perhaps you called your son a loser in front of the whole subway. It might have been that you drew a swastika on a wall. Or that when you draw a swastika on a wall, you do it backwards. Rest assured, you bothered me.   Perhaps it was when you cut the line because you didn’t bother to notice there was one. Or it was the wearing-sunglasses-indoors thing. It’s bothersome to hear your phone ringing in the nice restaurant. The kind of restaurant where phones shouldn’t ring. If it wasn’t that, it was the way you were shouting epithets to your friends on the subway platform. Or how you picked up some effete guy’s dollar that he dropped and insisted it was yours.   It could be the hissyfit you threw at the deli because the slices weren’t thick enough. Or that you’re on Prozac yet taking comedy classes. Maybe it was because I could see your penis. There’s a chance it was the lit cigarette you tossed on the ground. Or the open-mouth chomping of the gum, complete with snapping noises. Maybe it’s the rainbow flag waving. Or that you have six kids and no spouse. Perhaps it’s the fact that you couldn’t spell, even if the spelling Gestapo were threatening to ship you off to Spellschwitz. It could be the thoughtless placement of your shopping cart. Or your misuse of the apostrophe. It bothers me.   Maybe I took offense to the way you called your significant other a whore. Or it could have been when you interrupted my conversation to ask for money. The way you decided that jumping in front of me was the proper leaflet-delivery method. Or the issue could be you choosing to ignore my having right-of-way. Perhaps it’s your habit of spray-painting your creative impulse or politics on every surface. And putting your face in your own billboard advertisement… that bothers me.   It could be that you’re rich and make sure everyone knows it. Or that you’re the laziest person I’ve ever seen. Perhaps it’s because you’re completely unemployable. Or it might be that you’re an arrogant sociopath. There’s a good chance it was because you don’t get sarcasm. Or because you swear in front of children. It might have been when you didn’t use gloves to make my sandwich. And you kept touching your forehead. Maybe it’s because you held the subway doors open so you could continue chatting with your friend. Trust me, you bothered me.   It certainly may have been the puddle of poodle urine you allowed to happen in front of my apartment. Or the way you entered the subway car before we exited. Or that you sleep all day. Letting the door close in my face bothered me too. As did the riding of the skateboard down the sidewalk full of people. The 300 Gigawatt car stereo system bothered me at 4:30 in the morning. As did your business-killing smoking ban. The way you lie about yourself in your online personal ad bothers me. As does the fact you use online personals.   It could be the way you talk about therapy like it’s normal. Maybe it’s your insistence that everyone needs therapy. Or your belief that everyone is gay. Perhaps it’s because you’re gay, lesbian, trans-gendered or straight. Maybe it’s that you drive a Hummer. You bother me.   It could be your liberalism or conservatism. Your blind patriotism and your contempt of the homeland bothers me. It could be that you’re obese and ordering a venti mocha. Or it might just bother me that you make up new words when “small, medium and large” would suffice. Or it was how you blatantly stole my cab. Perhaps your clothes being filthy bothered me.   It’s possibly your lewd behavior. Your lousy taste in music. Your failed hygiene. Or how you blanket the entrance to the building with smoke. Maybe it’s that you’re selling drugs in my neighborhood. Or the way you give money to anyone feigning homelessness. Or how you feel the need to fondle your girlfriend so all can see. All of that bothers me.   Your racism bothers me. As does your multi-culturalism. And the fact that you didn’t bother to rsvp to our wedding even though the stamp was provided. It could be that you’re not competent at what you do. Or that you complain every day to the superintendent about fingerprints in the elevator and menus under the door. Telling people you’re an actor when you’ve never made a penny acting bothers me. As does the fact that you can’t seem to run the Post Office.   Your junk email bothers me. The fact that you think I’m stupid enough to provide a Nigerian with my bank account information bothers me. And you can imagine how annoyed I get when you try to kill me because I think differently than you do. I also disapprove of you robbing banks and your adultery. Really, it bothers me.   I don’t like your yipping little dog. Or that you became famous and aloof. It very well might be your purple hair. Or the tattoos. Perhaps it’s that you’re holding Hillary’s book. Or you talk too loud when it’s not warranted. Maybe it’s because you’re an underpaid, undereducated bureaucrat and giving me grief. Or that it takes you 25 minutes to parallel park. That just bothers me.   Perhaps it’s that you’re 30 and still have posters taped to the wall. Or that you’re obsessed with sex. Perhaps it’s because you watch Showtime when HBO is so much better. Or that you honestly believe the earth is only 10,000 years old. It might be your atheism. It could be because you’re a militant vegan. Or that you don’t listen. Or held up the line. Your gum is on my shoe. You dinged my car. Your cable access show sucks. You can’t speak English. You’re wishy-washy. You wear too much perfume. You try too hard. You’re paying with a check. You waste money at deli ATMs with $2.50 service fees. You hate your parents. You only date Jewish girls. You always want to share appetizers. You like jazz. You press the elevator buttons as if that will make it come any faster. You live in a 5th floor walk-up. You declared bankruptcy. You think you’re so great. You’re pretentious. You’re weak. You show off at the gym. You pitch your sob story to a captive audience in the subway. You don’t know the difference. You don’t tip. You tip too much.   I can’t put my finger on it, but something about you bothers me.

      By Leah Greenberg  Three weeks ago I  specifically   asked Mr. Gonzalez to be around on Sunday May 16th to help me with a delivery.  I needed him to help carry up 6 boxes of packing bubbles to my parent's storage apartment in our Upper West Side building.    My school is having a science project week and I needed these bubbles for my super-secret project.  Last year, the winning project got the winner into Princeton.  I mean, it might have had something to do with the fact that that kid was a total dork, but I need to get into an Ivy league school and my grades alone is not going to get me in there. Don't even ask me about my S.A.T.'s.  So, I reminded the doorman again and again, to the point where he would say "Audrey, when is that delivery again" and start laughing in that fat little man sort of way that really annoys me.  Plus I don't like the fact that he's sometimes checking out my ass in the mirror.  My mother says not to worry, that in the Puerto Rican culture it is considered a compliment or something.  Anyway, so on Sunday, the buzzer rings and it's the delivery guys.  They're downstairs. I go downstairs, a little hung over from the night before, so I'm already cranky, and Mr. Gonzalez is not there!  I ask the other guy, who is 82 years old (I think he played Blue in Old School but I am not sure) and he says that Hector had to take his daughter to Sunday School.  What the fuck?  Sunday school?

       Jersey City, NJ  - For years, what have restaurants Houston's, Chili's, and Bennigan's shared in common?  Overpriced food, overly friendly service, and - time and time again - getting their lunch handed to them by 800-pound gorilla TGI Friday's.    Talk to management of any of the three completely interchangeable, instantly forgettable restaurants, and you hear a similar refrain: enough was enough.  Now they're doing something about it.  In what experts are calling the largest merger ever in the food and beverage industry, Houston's, Chili's, and Bennigan's will close their doors immediately and by early August, reopen under the new "Hooligans" brand name.     urlLink      The new, "no-nonsense" logo    The new restaurant, in an attempt to shed the humdrum, dime-a-dozen personality of its three predecessors, will be known for its value-priced menu, served to customers by an uncaring, belligerent staff.    "We'd just gotten fed up with being the red-headed stepchild [in the restaurant business]", commented Frank diPizio, COO, of Bennigan's Inc.  "As it turns out, I ran into some executives from Chili's and Houston's at a recent trade show.  Maybe we'd had a little too much to drink, but after a few hours of griping at the hotel bar, we said we had to do something.  Friday's was just kicking our asses. And 'Hooligans', I am proud to say, is the result of not wanting to be kicked around anymore."  The new corporate management team is interviewing regional managers now and hopes to have staff in place at each Hooligans location by mid-July.  A three-week training course will ensue.  After a team-building trip to get their heads shaved, prospective waiters will then be trained in such areas as staredowns, smashing people over the head cleanly with beer bottles, and affecting indecipherable cockney accents.  They'll also learn how to carry a large tray of food while blindingly drunk.  Not everyone is convinced.  "If they think they can con the American public into eating greasy fried food in a sterile setting with a staff that couldn't care less about them, they've got another thing coming" said Brian Murphy, General Manager of the Appleby's on Main St. in Morristown, NJ.     urlLink      Meet the new waitstaff at Hooligans' flagship location in Times Square, NYC!    One woman seemed to be in favor of the new idea.  "It sounds great!", offers Pam Snodgrass of Bergen County, NJ, mother of 4 boys.  "Not only do I get to save a couple bucks, but if any of my own little 'hooligans' acts up, I can ask for an assist from one of the waiters.  Personally, I'm excited."  Company officials expect that just under 1500 restaurants will be opened under the Hooligans name in August, with another 100 opening by year's end.

       Vatican City -  In a surprising blow to Christianity and religious faithful worldwide, the Vatican is now reporting that the second coming of Jesus Christ "already came and went."  According to a press release issued by the Holy See on Sunday, Jesus Christ "returned to this world to spread His message of peace and love, again."  The Vatican reports that the Lord appeared in a number of cities across the United States but spent most of His time at the Dunkin Donuts in Crawford, Texas.  Jeff Mack, assistant manager at the Dunkin Donuts in Crawford, said: "I could tell the guy was different, even though he had a cell phone and wore jeans and a T-shirt like most people around here.  He asked me once if I knew how he could get onto the President's ranch, but I told him the security's pretty tight up there.  Guess he gave up."  Mack added: "He liked crullers mostly.  Also eclairs.  Never gave us any problems.  Sorry to lose the business frankly."  The White House confirms that it received several phone calls from a man claiming to be Jesus Christ, but that it dismissed the calls at the time.  The President will hold a press conference later this week to provide further details.  However, a source close to the President speaking on condition of anonymity said: "Of course we get hundreds of bogus calls every day from people claiming to be Jesus, Elvis, Gandhi.  There's no way we could have known that this one wasn't just another wacko."  Dr. Gordon Phillip, professor of religious studies at Georgetown University and a leading expert on Christian prophecy, says that he is disappointed that mankind missed a "once in millenia" opportunity to receive the lessons of Jesus Christ.  "Without more information, it's hard to speculate on why Jesus came back at this moment, and even more difficult to understand why he didn't stick around longer.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if he just took a good look around and decided to wash his hands of the lot of us."
