       my thoughts are your thoughts...      i think of you and my see myself   reflected on the brown depths of yours   the love and care shines through   the thin film beneath your eyes   love that vowed to be with me   wherever i will be.   love that promised never to let go   amidst the darkness that engulfs me.   love willingly shared his soul   and opened his heart    to a whole new world of emotions   unlocking feelings buried deep inside me   that had never been unleashed.   for who shall give me this love   but only that of which who is   willing to share not only his heart, body and soul   but also his mind and spirit.   yet after everything that was said and done   there is still room for doubt...   slowly sinking itself   in the warm depths of those very brown eyes   that held the love for me.   and though love dominated those clear ebony diamonds   doubt gnawed itself through...   unseen and undetected...   until it reached the love in your eyes.   and in one sudden moment,   everything has changed.   no longer do i see love   in your clear, brown eyes   now in place of it was anger and contempt.   the eys that had once held    the promise of forever   had stared me down into what seemed   like a puddle of whirling emotions.   just as soon as it started,   it began to end.   and now as i sat in darkness,   no light shall dawn upon me   carrying the torch of your love.      my thoughts are your thoughts...   and i wish that sometimes it isn't so.

       just when you thought that this was gonna be an oh so exciting day…everything just backfires!  i have been excited all week waiting for this day to come. ive literally counted the hours…and then this is what im gonna get. a ton of schoolwork, a ranting mother and my one heck of a no show boyfriend.  i am so sick of school…so tired of studying. this is the only day to relax. im even lucky to be at home this Saturday. i was supposed to be in a confidential god-knows-where place today but luckily it was moved next week. at least i think im lucky.  and then after 3 weeks of emotional torture im finally going to see him. but because im suppose to understand the this and that of being so far away, im stuck here typing in my pc, pouring all my emotional upheavals in this one heck of an i-don’t-know-what –to-call article.  damn!  am i always supposed to be the ever understanding girlfriend???  and then when we are finally going to have the chance to talk, im the one who will turn out to be the one who started this so-called misunderstanding.  i am so sick of all this! i am so sick of everything i do! why cant i have a peaceful and stress free life???  dammit!

         i was just browsing the net when it just suddenly came to me to check these 'blogs' so usually mentioned by my friends. and then suddenly i just found myself creating one of these accounts...      i dont usually spend too much time on things like this but then it kinda made me think that maybe it can help me...this may sound cheesy or something but whenever i feel down or angry or something..i try..take note..try to write. and it helps...yep...it does...      tonight im in a writing mode...this only happens when im in a fit of a strong emotion.       something seems to be missing in my life.      thats what i intend to find out...      i am here to find the reason of my existence      this is the first of more to come...
