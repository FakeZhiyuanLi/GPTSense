       Tell me if I'm wrong, but aren't kisses suppose to mean something?  It did to me, I thought it did to him.  I guess I was wrong.  He was suppose to come over tonight.  He didn't.  He never does.  Gosh, I hate him for messing with my heart like this.  I can't take it any more.  I think it's over between us.  I think it was over the minute he gave me that meaningless kiss.

      I promised myself that I wouldn't do this- wait around for a boy to call- and I am!!! I hate myself for being this vunerable rite now.  This changed our friendship-a lot, and I think he's afraid because of this- but I think that even if things don't work out between us- we'll always have our friendship- I think I might breakup with him- I can't pretend that things aren't different, and I certainly can't pretend that it doesn't hurt when he doesn't call- before all this started he called me every night- now, it's like never.  Why can't he see that even if this doesn't work out, I value our friendship way to much to let anything ruin it- the thing is- maybe it's already ruined- maybe. He ruined it by confessing how he really felt and then just ignoring it... I suppose, however, I'm the maddest at myself- I broke my promise- I let myself become vunerable- I am Brittanie, and  I  am a promise breaker.

        Well, a buddy of mine suggested I try this. So I am, and I give myself major props for leaving my comfort zone and sharing my life with the world.  My life is quite uneventful, but perhaps this journal will improve my already fantastic writing skills. - Gosh, I sound cocky!!! (I'm really not, I don't think I am good at anything, but the one thing I am confident in is my writing ability.)  Anyways, here's to my boring, nonchalant life. Peace Out, Brit

        Today my mom and I went back to school shopping at  Steve and Barry's which has really cool university paraphenelia.  I got some cool outfits ( I'm not really into the whole sporty look, more like preppie/ retro punk).  Anyways, senior year starts in 12 days.  I have really mixed emotions- I mean I'm stoaked because it's finally over- the final stretch, but I don't know, the whole social aspect is kind icky- it's so cliques and trivial.  As for the learning aspect, I'm really excited to be back to school and getting some knowledge back into my head, even though my school is especially mediocre when it comes to academics.  I feel like the summer, kind of drains one's knowledge bank, I honestly don't know what I would do without education and knowledge.  It's fascinating for me to learn- one day at work, I saw a book that had all these chemical compounds, formulas, and breakdowns, and the sad thing is I probably could break them all down without the book.  Besides, to me, knowledge really is power- it really does hold the key to my future.  I don't know, as much as I hate getting up early to go to school, and as much as I hate the whole social aspect of school- I am actually a big advocate for year round education.    GOSH, I AM SUCH A GEEK!!!   Btw: My schedule for the first term is as followed: Trigonometry- They stopped making it an honors course this year! Advanced Placement English Anatomy Honors Advanced Placement Economics Computer Applications- unfortunately it's required

        My philosophy in life ( well since I started dying my hair freshman year) has always been that red heads are sexy.  They are! Don't laugh at me.  Reds hold a subtly seductive power that promotes confidence and refreshment.  However, my days of red are over- at least for the time being.  I just went brunette- and might I say- I look pretty darn good ( I have to keep this Pg because my family reads this).  LOL    Anyways, so on a more important issue:  my college search coming along quite well ( Although my aunt thinks even though I'm smart even to go Ivy League, I shouldn't because I need a backup.)  My list is as followed:   The UK  ( In the UK, you can apply to 6 colleges on one application, so I decided to take advantage of that)    University of Reading    Queen's University of Belfast    University of Glasgow    University of London Royal Holloway    Oxford University   Washington DC      Georgetown University- Early decision   Massachusetts      Wellesley College- All girls, I know, but as far as political careers for women, it's the top of the top   New York      New York university   California      UCLB- It's my safety school  For those of you who did not know, I really want to get into politics (I'm thinking eventually maybe Senate) So I thus plan on practicing New York Law ( everyone who is successful in politics starts off in New York Law.  Another (final) tidbit:  Although  I am not democratic, I find it rather fascinating that Chelsea Clinton attends Oxford, Hillary went to Wellesley, and Bill went to Georgetown.  Perhaps I really will succeed in politics  PEACE OUT, Brit

      Gosh that was a great movie, and I suppose partly, I can't ever sleep (I usually have an extreme case of insomnia) because I am afraid I'll be lonely for the rest of my life.   BUT  that was not the problem tonight.  My problem tonight was that my unequivocal dick of an ex decided to text message at 1Am (I was fast asleep which is a rarity for me( I usually can't fall asleep until like 7Am))to tell me it was over.  Now, I knew it was coming, and actually, I was going to break up with him ( although not by text messaging- which is quite juvenile), but not at 1Am! Anyways, we fought for about 4 hrs ( text messaging, mind you) and by the time we stopped, I was wide awake.  So now, thanks to him,  I am running on an hour of sleep,  and  I have to be at work in an hour.  Much thanks to him.  On a lighter note, in my opening blog I said I decided to use this to perfect my already terrific writing skills- well I changed my mind.  ( Just thought you should know that this is not by best work)  Also, I've been thinking of changing my screename...Any suggestions?    BTW:     Sleepless in Seattle  was based on my all time favorite movie:  An Affair to Remember
