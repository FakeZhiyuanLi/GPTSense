      I've started working out, again.  I really do not like to work out.  It takes too much time.  Gimme a pill, you know.  But now that I'm 40, I think it is important to take care of this body since its the only one I get.  Even days are for strength training, odd ones are cardio.  Bleh, cardio, my least favorite of the whole scheme.  I'm forcing myself to do it, though.  Trying to get back to where I'm addicted to it again.  I move in such extremes.  I used to live to work out.  Then I quit after some guy at the swap meet called me a freak because I had some pretty well-developed muscles.  Later on in years I tried to begin again and that man's face would swim into my sweaty vision and I'd lose steam.  Funny.  I've forgotten his face now.  I don't remember what he looked like, but I can still hear that word sort of muttered in my general direction.  "Freak."  Oh well, I gotta do....  I wanted to blog a bit about my faith.  I'm proud to be Pagan under the watchful, caring, sweet & calm umbrella of the Great Mother.  Earth.  Shakespeare said something like:  Let the forest be my guide.  I'll find my books in the running brooks, let the squirrels and foxes be my teachers.  (I'll look it up and post the correct quote later.)  That's what I believe.  It's what I've always believed, really.  I understood, at an early age, the interrelationship between man and the universe.  I sometimes find it hard to come to terms with the way most people conduct their lives every day without thought for what the earth and universe does for us or what it means to be a part of this magnificent, awesome process called our world.  How do they do it?  How did I do it for so many years.    I've come home.  I wanted to describe the feeling I have about finding this faith, but each time I attempt to put it into words I'm dumbstruck for the right ones.  Though I'm a solitary, it was and is always fantastic to find that others feel the same as me.  In fact, there are thousands who feel this way.  There is this world, this collective consciousness of which I have only recently become aware.  I had forgotten to listen to the inner me and let that remembered faith guide me.  I do remember.  I am remembering more every day.
