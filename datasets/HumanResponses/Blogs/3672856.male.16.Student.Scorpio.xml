      I was preparing my stuff for track when suddenly the phone rang.earlier,i sent an e-mail to tanjong pagar united asking if i could join their centre of excellence.Im not sayin that my footy skills are well fab. but im just trin out cos footy is my life.initially,i wanted to try for my home town club but had to be a realistic.SAF has all the top notch lads an im gonna find it hard to get in.So i tried out for TPUFC.Moreover,it is near my second home(outram sec.)its at the commonwealth pitch an i noe that i have to impress the gaffer in a good way.Im not goin there juz to take down half the team with my cruncing tackles or stupify the entire defence with my 101 trickeries.Im not gonna act up my bad boy temper which im tryin to curb when someone is gonna wind me up.I know its tough but im gonna go for it.Its not as though all soccer players have it easy in the beginning.even cannavaro was a ballboy before becoming a top notch defender an captain of the national side.So wish me luck man.....need all of it.

      Was messaging Yanni on the phone bout the new fixtures for the epl 2004/2005.But she told me that it won't be out till 6pm in Singapore.I was well estatic.Besides,the last two teams that faced the magpies on the opening day ended up in div.1 later so i hopin it was man.utd or liverpool cos i hate em!Esp. Liverpool cos they broke my heart when they sold Robbie Fowler to Leeds and his career took a downfall.So when i checked it out at 6,i was well chuffed.We are gonna face Boro on the opening day!Generally,Newcastle fans hate Sunderland(they had a monkey for a manager at one time) and vice-versa but as we all know,those suckers are at the nationwide cos they are well crap!so we only have boro,who we also hate but not as intense as the Black Cats(now you know why they got relegated?).Anyway,i think we are gonna tonk boro real bad cos they still livin in their fairyland of winning the carling cup.big deal!Besides,they are facing the kings of the North East,pride of Tynecastle:newcastle united!i reckon the scoreline will be 3-1 in our favour.bellers will be in the scoresheet and so will al shearer since it is his last season.Hope Woody(my fave)holds the defence tight and drop bramble cos he is a misfit!in the end of the season,we will lift the trophy high up in the sky!a run in the FA Cup is not bad either since we won it six times already.Long live Newcastle!

      i dunno wats wif all these idiots who try their darnest best to wind me up.to be honest,i do not trust anyone.besides,how on god's earth do i do that?i got screwed up by lin qi and kelvin when i was in sec.1 and almost got caned.that would ave been a bad start to my 5 years in outram.though im kinda silent right now,but some things never change.call it bad karma,unfortunate,etc. but no matter what i do,there is bound to be someone who wants the dubious honour of creating mayhem for me.but im gonna set the record straight for my aggressors;you cannot kill what is already dead.in other words,the old fat,rash,bumbling fool of the past is DEAD.the new dalif maybe be keeping his cards down but its not his guard that is down.somehow,i despise my old form as the innocent one cause if i were to face him right now,i would tell him to stop laying down and let everyone hurt you.instead,go out and show that no one can keep you down.r.i.p old smd.to the people to try their darnest best to ruin my life,don't.im not the old dalif that you once knew and berated.the new dalif is totally different.

      God damn it.Now Italy has gone outta euro championships.this is totally pathetic.i mean,with only "pippo" inzaghi out,wat is there to lose?well,look no further than francesso totti.touted to be a superstar,it was his foolish action by spitting on christian poulsen which caused the azzuris to be eliminated.whats his problem anyway?money cannot buy trophies ya noe...so it looks like im gonna support all the adidas clad teams cause its obvious,non?but i gotta say,rooney is on vindaloo!dat lil boxer from everton has proven his weight in gold by being the top scorer as i speak.but where is kieron dyer?england's achilles heel is the left and it so happens to be dyer's place.wat on earth is sven-goran eriksson thinking?so i still think that england will find it hard to win the euro.But something tells me that 'ikea and 'fairytale' conspired the draw!call me sour grapes but there is more than meets the eye......

      I juz dunno wats going thru my mind this instant.its like a whrilwind of events swirling into my mind.First,the re-emergence of my crush.I dunno how to handle my feelings for her.its been so long since i saw and i tried taking it off my mind.But it just occurs to me all the time during the hols.she even looks more sultry than before but its a long dist. kinda thing so i guess its impossible.Another thing that is racking my brains rite now is my mum.when will she ever stop being the obstacle to all my dreams?i guess when she passes away,i might feel more free.i know this sounds harsh but lifes like that,really.But i have to end things in a cheery note.I only got a month left to prepare for the national track and field championships.so far its going kinda swell but gotta train harder...i guess thats all for now...

      Yup,no more braces for me.now,im a free man!i look better though i dont really smile.I wonder why.i had to bear the thought of looking boyish cos of the fangled things in my teeth and i think thats why im single.i mean,who wants a guy who looks intimidating and still wear braces?i know i wont.played footy yest.wif the nufc lads and i gotta say that i have bonded much closer with them even aft two sessions!Jing Xiang happened to be in outram before so the common bond is there.But the rest are equally great.I still dunno how to tackle keegan cos he is so slippery like a eel!but the highlight of the day was the tackle jing xiang gave to dom.dat guy is massive but he was still bein brought down!i also created a wonderful goal,panna the player,jing xiang crosses and raja scores!what a defining moment.maybe i cld play in the matches,no?Floorball however was kinda fine.tho we got third,but we fought like real warriors.big up to yall!

      Ok,a debut that is so screwed.The team lost 5-1 to Spurs but hey,it was all due to set pieces. Only Keegan managed to save us from a terrible death and prevent Spurs from getting a clean sheet.My debut was a lil ok,playing in defence in the first half and in midfield in the second.I must say that playing in midfield is more suited to my style.But like what Yanni text messaged me,she is sure that we can do it better.I also got my fave no. that is 6!.same as woody i noe but bowyer is my fave.but woody is too.incidentally,bowyer(my fave) and given(Yanni)got the eye infection.damn!Nani also mesaged me saying that she cannot do so anymore.i dunno how long its gonna take but the feeling of deja vu looms again and i dun wanna want it happen again.Looks like its better to stay single.I just hope things take a better turn next time round.....
