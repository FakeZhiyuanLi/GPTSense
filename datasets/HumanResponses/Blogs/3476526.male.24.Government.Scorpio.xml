       I downloaded the trial yesterday and immediately fell in love with Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots.  This is an expansion to an already popular RTS.  Later that day, I went to the mall and bought both Rise of Nations and its expansion pack.  This is certainly an involved RTS that doesn't lose replay value.  Thrones and Patriots adds many features to the game.  There are more nations to play as and now you can select a form of government which will assist your campaign.    The solo player Conquer the World campaign allows you to either play as a historical figure or vie for global domination in a risk-like battlefield.  The span of the game is from ancient to modern civilization.  I highly recommend trying out the trial of this game.  Its website can be found at  urlLink Rise of Nations from Microsoft Game Studios and Big Huge Games   If you decide its right up your alley go pick it up.  Please go ahead and pay the $1.99 for the fan site kit/wallpaper/strategy guide.  There is a $10 rebate inside of it for the expansion pack.  Its worth the two dollars.

       The 2nd one was just as fun as the first, Started around 11:00am on friday. Like always we had minor problems with the new guys coming to game. Did a little reformating and installing new a OS. So people didnt get bored we ran up a little "LOTR - War of the ring" which was new to Game Fest being a Real-time Strategy game. Those that didnt want to play started loading up diffrent games to play next. We fixed all the computer problems and moved to the ever popular "UT 2004". Running Onslaught and Assault maps kept "UT 2004" interest for hours.  After "UT 2004" we wanted something a little new so we loaded up some "Aliens vs Predators 2" . With aliens crawling all over and marines dieing the tension got high. The yells and screams came more frequantly. So we decided to take a break for food and started making pizzas. By the end of the night we had eaten eight pizzas.  Feeling refreashed we played some more "UT 2004". Shortly after that, people started to leave around 10:00pm and we did a little file sharing. With the few people we had left, some one on one action with "Crimson Skies" took place. Real-time Strategies took another turn as "Empire Earth" was played as well.

       It has been nearly a week since the first of many LAN parties.  All in all things went well.  There were minor problems with a few PCs--as always--but the majority of attendees had their shit straight.  Quake III became the early game of choice.  Due to a staggering polarization of experience it quickly grew boring.  While several players set up Unreal Tournament 2004, a small game of Battlefield Vietnam was taking place.  Eventually the run & gun became the next flavor of the day.  There are a lot of LAN-worthy games out there.  At first glance, it seems almost impossible to keep every player interested in the same games.  The solution: trying something new.  I had never played Unreal Tournament until Saturday.  The dynamics and gameplay were so similar to the other run & gun games it grew on me quickly.  There are a lot of different game types and maps that were new to me.  Which we can assume maintained my interest.  For Game Fest to become larger and more successful there will need to be more variety.  First-person shooters always dominate at LANs but other types should be given a try.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Call of Duty, and Battlefield (1942/Vietnam) were just a few that didn't get a chance.  A conversation with the attendees would reveal the lack of interest in RTS.  However, I think RTS provides another aspect of a LAN that is vital.  Real-time Strategies, such as Warcraft III and Command & Conquer, create a much different approach to gaming.  Players are forced to use teamwork and communication more so than they would in FPS.  The next Game Fest I attend--I'm missing one today due to surgery--a variety of games will only raise my interest.  I'd like to close by offering a place to upload game updates.  Drop me an email if you have drivers or updates that you would like readily available for the next LAN.

       I had a meeting with our commander yesterday and everything went very well. They were a little concerned about vandilism, control over the building and some other minor things. I have to get a little more information and Email to them. All that shouldnt be a problem and once that happens then they are going to have a meeting with all the other chiefs and stuff to try and find a place that we want. Once that happens I am going to look into getting stuff out of DRMO like tables, monitors, more cables and a bigger switch. So we are one step closer to getting a bigger and better place.
