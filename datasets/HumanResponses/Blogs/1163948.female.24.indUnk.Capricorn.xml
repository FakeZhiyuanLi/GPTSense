       I took a long lunch today to go see Ali Sweeney, a.k.a. Samantha Brady of Days of Our Lives, who was at the barnes & noble on 48th st signing copies of her new book, "All The Days Of My Life (So Far)."
  
 she was so sweet! she has bangs now and was looking very pretty. i told her about the songs I've written for Sami, she seemed into it... totally got a crazy rush of energy right afterwards.
 Unfortunately the digital camera died so no pictures...
 It amazes me how star-struck I get every now and again. I was all walking around midtown smiling like a freaking tourist. We had a nice conversation though, I can hold my own. Usually if I meet "celebrities" they're not really people I have a lot of respect for artistically so I act like myself. But once in a while the inner fanchild emerges...
 oh yeah, while I was waiting on line I heard the entire "twist" spoiler. It's out there, but it sounds pretty fucking cool. We'll see if Reilly can pull this off and explain everything...

        urlLink Crazy lady blues  is a song by British folk singer  urlLink Sandy Denny  off her album "The Northstar Grassman and the Ravens" (released in 1971). If you click on my "profile" to the right that's a picture of her with Richard Thompson in the background, playing in Fairport Convention. Follow the link above for a top-notch fansite. "Crazy Lady Blues" was supposedly written for Richard's wife Linda, who was Sandy's best friend and fellow folk singer.
 Linda's story is fascinating - she & Richard put out several albums together in the '70s as a duo. In '76 they converted to Muslim and retreated from music to live in communes for a bit, then made a comeback tour in '82. Unfortunately that comeback tour was the end of their marriage, which was played out in legendary onstage screaming matches and other general self-destructive debauchery. Linda's voice also started acting out - her voice literally would not work. For nearly 20 years she was out of the limelight because of something the doctors called "hysterical dysphonia" but after some botox injections in her throat (yes, botox) she was back in '03 with a new album, "Fashionably Late," which sounds as if she hasn't aged a day. [for more info:  urlLink index magazine interview ]
 In the future I plan on spotlighting some other heroines, and talking about things that interest me in general, such as baseball and days of our lives. And whatever else I feel like doing. I do want you to read, although I'm never going to claim to be a "good writer" and will often write run on sentences that go on for very, very long without a period, such as this one. Don't even try to correct my grammar, i don't give a fuck. However, feel free to point out my spelling errors, such as "obligitory" below. Thanks for stopping by.

        What we need is a tough new kind of feminism with no illusions. Women do not change institutions simply by assimilating into them, only by consciously deciding to fight for change. We need a feminism that teaches a woman to say no — not just to the date rapist or overly insistent boyfriend but, when necessary, to the military or corporate hierarchy within which she finds herself.

 In short, we need a kind of feminism that aims not just to assimilate into the institutions that men have created over the centuries, but to infiltrate and subvert them.

 To cite an old, and far from naive, feminist saying: "If you think equality is the goal, your standards are too low." It is not enough to be equal to men, when the men are acting like beasts. It is not enough to assimilate. We need to create a world worth assimilating into.

       i miss college. what i miss even more than all the irresponsible partying and getting up at 1 pm every day is spending my productive time learning about interesting things like feminism and cultural studies. i might go to grad school, but it's so very expensive, and i still have about $80,000 in loans from four years of librul arts..... (thanks mom & dad!)
 the very very serious reason i want to do this blog, aside from giving my friends a break on the emails i send them all the time about the below subjects, is feminism. feminism is very, very, very, very serious. for serious now. i'm still formulating my theories - but some of the topics i'd like to address are as follows:
 - the role of "asshole culture" in women's lives - the current state of women in music - how people in and out of my life are creating a better world - how people are fucking up that world - are feminism and misogynism mutually exclusive? - being funny, non-defensive, and the opposite of what "feminists" are supposed to be (i think this is part of the above)
 also there will be no more of these "explain yourself!" type posts. leave comments you fuckers. i know you are reading.

        disclaimer for people who think i am insane: 
 this is a really huge deal. the soaps have been losing ratings like crazy over the past few years and the rumours were that NBC was going to cancel days. so they started doing crazy budget cuts and firing all their longtime actors in this serial killer story. which inevitably boosted the ratings, because people that had been on the show for 20, 30 years were being sacked in these horrific bloody death scenes... and the killer was the show's heroine, marlena (think susan lucci only better) ...and now it's been revealed in the aforementioned HUGE TWIST that all 10 people who died are actually alive on a tropical island. i'll repeat myself - it's a really huge deal. there will probably be less days posts later on because summers on soaps are notoriously sloooooooowwwww...
 but really, if you hate soaps why are you reading this?
 
  What about the alleged meeting that took place on April 1 that informed the stars they would be returning?
 We let the cat out of the bag on April 1. The scripts were about to hit the stage, and I knew the entire cast and crew needed to know as one instead of hearing or reading about it. I asked them all to come, and I spoke to them for about 20 minutes as I lured them into this plot. I said, "I have to come clean with you, this has been the plan since we started in September ... I'd like to introduce you to the new cast of Days of Our Lives, in order of their disappearance." When Frances Reid (Alice) walked onstage, it was just one of the most amazing moments I've ever experienced behind the set. I've never seen a greater outpouring of emotion from the cast and crew. People were in tears. Peter Reckell (Bo) and Drake Hogestyn (John), you don't see these guys cry too often, and they were openly sobbing, as were many of the cast members.

        My dear friends, 
Just a note to say the best is yet to come. I go back to DOOL on June 7th. The tale is bigger than life with twists and powerful turns. I promise a good ride. After all coming back has always reminded me that the DiMeras live differently than the norm. We are not exactly Draculas but we never die. We'll disturb the hypocritical? ones and find amusement in their posturing. 
Seriously I can't wait for the next stage in Reilly's saga. 
Thank you again for your great support... 
Lets love well and enjoy life. 
Until then ....Love Thaao

       From my favorite "newspaper," the Post: "There have absolutely been serial killers [on other soaps] but there's never been a case where the people the serial killer murdered are all alive together on an island that's an exact duplicate of the town they came from." -James E. Reilly (days headwriter)
 God, that about says it, doesn't it? Seriously now, the Island thing would be pretty interesting... except I don't get it yet. We were waiting for this big payoff and are just left with more and more questions. And the empathy we as viewers felt for the survivors back in the "real" Salem is now completely gone. Reilly's ignoring a subtlety that made soaps what they are in the first place, which is now lost in the face of dropping ratings. Crying along with the TV is a big reason many women watch soaps, it provides an outlet for our daily neuroses and emotions that don't come into full consciousness very often. And laughing at ourselves and what we are crying at is a huge part of that too. It's a coping mechanism, a means of daily support and escape.
 And you know, soaps are not the only means of entertainment that serve this purpose. Look at baseball - something with which I am almost equally obsessed. It's a huge rollercoaster of ups and downs that are even more emotional than the crying ladies or shirtless hunks of daytime... a baseball fan is mindfucking each hitter that comes up and each pitch that is thrown. If Piazza is in a slump, Shea Stadium will put all their hope in his next at-bat, only to be bitterly disappointed. I've seen the difference between a winning crowd and a losing one after the game - the only similarity is the "Yankees Suck" cheer that echoes in the halls.

  urlLink first off...  this dirty old town is gonna sink right down. according to this link my neighborhood has 400 times the amount of pollution deemed "safe" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I can tell this is correct because every surface in my room is covered in dust. cough.

       i feel very lucky that i've been given the opportunity to see The Pixies, Love, Patti Smith, Wire, Mission of Burma, ESG, The Box Tops, Lydia Lunch, & Sonic Youth all play their 20+ year old songs. And it's fucking AMAZING that Brian Wilson is out touring Pet Sounds and Smile (!!!) when the whole world thought he was an eternal acid casualty.
 Here's a quote from the infamous John Lennon Playboy interview:
 You know, they're congratulating the Stones on being together 112 years. Whoooopee! At least Charlie and Bill still got their families. In the Eighties, they'll be asking, "Why are those guys still together? Can't they hack it on their own? Why do they have to be surrounded by a gang? Is the little leader scared somebody's gonna knife him in the back?" That's gonna be the question. That's-a-gonna be the question! They're gonna look back at the Beatles and the Stones and all those guys are relics. The days when those bands were just all men will be on the newsreels, you know. They will be showing pictures of the guy with lipstick wriggling his ass and the four guys with the evil black make-up on their eyes trying to look raunchy. That's gonna be the joke in the future, not a couple singing together or living and working together. It's all right when you're 16, 17, 18 to have male companions and idols, OK? It's tribal and it's gang and it's fine. But when it continues and you're still doing it when you're 40, that means you're still 16 in the head.
 
 Mick Jagger, age 29, quoted on his birthday, July 26, 1972, during the party celebrating the end of the Exile on Main Street North American Tour: 
 
When I'm 33, I quit.
 
 Mick, in 2001 (age 58):
 Rock music has to have energy. It propels the whole thing. That's why people think that only young people can play rock music, and there's something in that, because young people have lots of energy... Rock & roll has been around for 50 years. So it's inevitable that some of the people doing it are quite old and have been around a long time. You don't have to be a genius to work that out... I think I am very mature for my age. I have moments when I am very grown up (laughs). No one likes getting old, but enjoying life is not the exclusive prerogative of young people. That's a very narrow view. I think it is wrong to behave as if you are 19 years old all the time, but it doesn't mean I have to be boring, sit around, reminisce and dismiss modern life as some awful incursion into my reverie about what I did in the 1960s...
 
 with everyone and their mother planning a reunion tour this year I'm starting to respect the folks that won't reunite though. Poor Johnny Ramone - everyone's calling for his obituary and he's  really  not dead yet. It's much more powerful to go out with a bang, like the Ramones did after 22 years of going strong. But should there be an age limit on rock? I think not.
 Does the proliferation of reunion tours take $$ away from new artists who are in greater number than ever? Do new artists deserve the same kind of recognition when many are simply ripping off their idols? I really don't know. I'd like to see a Runaways reunion. And I'd REALLY like to see that Big Star reunion that I've been unfortunate enough to have missed every time for the past 11 years.

       i'm still fighting off this cough, although it's not pulling me down into depths of misery like it was last week. below is the chart i found on NYC pollution:
  
 i've marked my various locations according to my rough estimation. the darkest patches are estimated to be 300 to 400 times the "safe level" of air toxics according to the EPA. [ urlLink link ]
 what does this mean for you and me? consider the fact that i never in my life suffered from seasonal allergies until I moved to New York. I read through the WTC-related articles and several non-WTC-related articles and have found that nobody really knows what the health hazards of our continuously deteriorating environment will ultimately be. Except that in cases of WTC fallout and general particle pollution it has been shown to affect the respiratory system. Sometimes people are diagnosed with allergies, sometimes bronchitis, sometimes acid reflux. To my untrained eye (and throat) it seems to be the same thing... but I'm no MD.
 it's kind of funny that i've been writing so much about my throat without making any note of one of my biggest fears... that i will contract linda thompson's syndrome and stop singing for 20 years. i'm pretty sure that won't happen... but you never know.
 this weekend i was with my entire family, which is comprised of a great majority of crazy ladies. they are always coming down with weird sicknesses which I like to refer to as "the white woman's disease"... a crude example of this would be, let's say it's time to clean the bathroom or do the dishes, and suddenly my mother's stomach starts cramping, or she is just SO tired and has to lie down. it's about much more than avoiding housework though. the physical sphere can't really be separated from the emotional.
 my grandparents were bickering over whether or not my grandma's constant complaints about various pains, etc, were real or imagined. it's pretty telling. last night a friend was telling me that as soon as her mental state goes awry, so does her body. i could name more than a few examples. but look at linda thompson - her problem wasn't emotional after all, like everyone thought for so long. [ urlLink more info here ] or was it? when i first journeyed to memphis i started out with a terrible head cold, but as soon as we crossed the border into tennessee it went away. and the 4-day drinking binge that followed didn't trigger it again. i was totally relaxed and happy.
 food for thought.

       from  urlLink soapoperafan.com ...
 "The ancient Greek word for palm tree is phoinix, the same word as for the  mythical bird. When early Bible translators were  translating the Greek version of the Old Testament into Latin, English  and other languages they often confused the two words translating phoinix as phoenix instead of palm tree as it was in the original Hebrew. Perhaps this is a clue to Stefano, or to a possible Dimera/Kirakis  alliance  (a Greek phoenix?)."

       oh christ, i can't get into this right now. but it really truly makes me cry to see my friends' bands describing themselves as "unlike other girl bands because we can play our instruments" or something to that effect. i guess i missed the part where the crappy girl band became a stereotype, can someone fill me in on that? was it riot grrl? 
 i'm sorry, i guess i just thought some people were above this sort of petty competition and it saddens me to know that they're not. i am too sensitive. but i've seen 3 bands that i really like and respect use this sort of line to promote themselves. that is something that i will never, ever do. the more girls playing and starting up, the better. you have to start somewhere. i don't suck. but i did when i started out. EVERYONE does. i'm just glad i was somewhat sheltered from these archaic sexist attitudes or i would have been much more likely to quit before i even began. i'm not naming names but ugh.
 [upon further inspection, i still want to cry, but it seems like it's more likely the rock critics and fans writing these words than the ladies themselves. regardless, that shit is fucked up and we need to get over it right now. is there any way of getting through to the people?]

        urlLink beth takes me on  yesterday in regards to irony.
 i just got off the IM with pia, who is listening to limbaugh right now so she can properly argue with her republican family. i think she is on to something. you have to speak the language of the opposition if you ever want to get through to them. which is why Fahrenheit 9/11 has so far been successful, because that's Michael Moore's strategy. soundbites instead of diatribes.
 it's sad but true that the majority of the american public is not so bright (to put it nicely). those of us that have had the privilege of higher education are basically living in a bubble. a big bubble, but a bubble nonetheless. nothing that i as a "shifty new yorker" (as my drummer was called in north carolina) say or do is going to make a difference in the hearts of the limbaugh-lovin', librul-hating right. which is why even though john kerry is beating bush to a pulp in the polls without hardly trying, my stomach still knots up over the thought of the election this november.
 those who vote red don't care about cultural progress, they're happy being soccer moms and breadwinners. they're fucking psyched that they can afford an SUV, a big screen TV, and a playstation though. and they'd like to keep it that way. and when fox news tells them that bush won the war and we can wipe our hands clean of iraq now, they use small words they can understand. the policy in screenwriting is to write for the lowest common denominator, which means that most TV and movie scripts are aimed at about a 12 year old audience.
 and what about all the ironic detachment left in our little bubble? cuz if i travel a mile i run into someone who plays up this hip-publican stance even now when times are so dire. thankfully a certain powerful, morally irresponsible unnamed media institution  urlLink has changed its stance and is taking action . (although i don't think you'll find its name on this site as that would probably alienate its demographic and cost it advertising $$.) there's hope but it really is time to let go of our nonchalant attitudes. because this does affect you, me, and everyone else.

       yes, it's fun to jibe at derek jeter and all that, but sometimes i just wonder about how much progress we have really made. in our post-modern, post-political, post-punk-post-whatever culture, it's real easy for me to drop bombs like "retarded" and "gay" in every day speak without even thinking twice. (i.e. "that's gay and retarded.") so what? it's funny. but it's not funny to everyone, and you forget that half the people laughing at it don't understand "irony." (i.e.  urlLink irony is wasted on the stupid .)
 with all the violence & fear in the world (all flags at half-mast all weekend) hatred has free reign to grow and consume people. i'm starting to think that all this inaction and apathy is just as powerful as the "over-action" (my coin) of certain groups of people that tends to turn the rest of us off.

        urlLink mystery and misery  may be the best music blog i've seen so far. lots of new, very under-the-radar, not half bad music, with smart and informed commentary. and good mixtape sense. this is inspiring me to go home and make mixtapes for all of you. [tape, CD, mp3... its all the same thing man]
 i've finally been sold on WFMU - i think it has something to do with me finally being sold on new music - anyway here are live sets from  urlLink Mr. Airplane Man  and  urlLink Mob Stereo ... you have to sit through like an hour and a half of regular DJing first, but that is the beauty of radio.
 i just realized that if you're not laura you probably don't know the back history here... alright then. as a youngster (i'm starting to feel quite old every time i utter that sentence) i lived and breathed college radio. it was my lifesource. i am not kidding. there was not much going on in my dorm room at boarding school, and i was extremely antisocial. quite the opposite of today. i got my kicks listening to the 3 local stations that played indie rock, and that was how i survived those formative years. so i have impeccably high standards for radio stations. for the longest time it was my impression that most stations in new york just didn't cut it, of course it always depends on the show. but i'm less bitter and more accepting of new things now. so if i hear one annoying song i probably won't turn the radio off, just the volume down... though it's hard to change the station when you're streaming, huh.

 Elisabeth Subrin: Making "Madness" Artist Talk
 Monday 8pm
 REENA SPAULINGS GALLERY
 371 Grand between Essex and Norfolk
 646-610-9036

 Filmmaker, video artist and screenwriter [my former professor / kind of sort of mentor / object of much admiration] Elisabeth Subrin will present research, film clips and strategies for working on and within issues and experiences of mental illness. An informal discussion on the nature,experience and poetics of "madness", both within popular culture and media art, this presentation is based on Subrin's decade long investigation into cinematic representations of women's afflictions as well as research from her screenplay about bipolar disorder. Part study of 'madness', part autobiographical account of Subrin's own experience, part how-to lecture on making it through.

       Happy Monday. I'm awfully busy today at work but I wanted to share with you this version of "Crazy Lady Blues" by Marianne Faithfull that I finally found this weekend. It's off her album "Rich Kid Blues." Very different interpretation of Sandy Denny's original. MF has said she hates this album as it came from one of the darkest points in her life, when she was hopped up beyond belief on those crazy downers of the late 70s (i have a feeling that quaaludes and other various '70s tranqs would probably make our generation's oxycontins and perkasets look like advil. feel free to prove me wrong.) I have a strange fascination with this sort of genius. Big Star's Third immediately comes to mind as a similarly wretched look into a shadowy soul. Same with Syd Barrett's solo work. More on this later I promise.
 unfortunately I can't seem to get this to work on my PC - let me know if you can. it may work on Mac but not PC. worked fine at home.
 UPDATED w/ new file - it's an AAC file so uh... see what happens if you so desire.

 Belles Are Ringing
 Starting on-air August 10th, the role of "Belle" will be portrayed by Martha Anne Madison. Martha began work July 20th. 

 "The producers felt that the full potential of the role was not being realized and decided it was better to make a change sooner rather than later."
 sucks for nubelle. oh well... let's hope nunubelle has better acting abilities...

        urlLink The Observer  takes on the "disturbing trend" of emo boys who do not omit the proper amount of masculinity. unfortunately, as a woman who has at one time been prey to the  urlLink horrible new york heterosexual dating scene , i can totally relate to this article. male passivity is indeed a strange cultural phenomenon that doesn't always work out the way you think it should. for more information on the subject, just talk to your single girlfriend about it and see what she says.
 here's the most convoluted paragraph in the whole essay, in which a 24 year old woman manages to diss on feminism, french people, and anal sex all in one quote:
 "All of this falls under the broad category of the collateral damage of feminism," she said. But she also detected another, sinister strain of influence: "The emo archetype is actually a French man—ambiguously sexual, creative intellectual types, tortured poets, they might say, who are actually deeply misogynistic and harbor the most archaic notions of femininity or male-female interaction. They have a terrible penchant for public displays of affection... but also for anal sex—which is more or less the only way men see they can dominate women fully and aggressively." 
 it's an affliction, friends, women of today and their aversion to feminism. the woman who said the above is clearly anti-misogyny, but she blames feminism for making it less straightforward. she is so confused that she actually blames the French as well for not being able to get laid.
 i've been giving this some thought, and i think this article documents the "disturbing trend" of men and women who are uncomfortable with their sexuality. progress is a scary thing. i hate the term "post-feminism." it's starting to make me want to kill someone. what the fuck is it? 
  urlLink Post-feminist  [wikipedia]
A Post-feminist is an anti essentialist, opposing simple binary oppositions such as man/woman in the hope of exploring or finding new subject positions for women outside of the mother/whore dichotomy and is in this respect linked to Post Modernism.

Post-feminism is seen in the work of Angela Carter in particular Passion of New Eve (1977) and in the work of other 'gender bending' authors, such as Jeanette Winterson, Patricia Duncker, and Judith Butler. 

 a ha! another case of people throwing around a term without fully understanding its meaning. no wonder i am so mad, i fucking hate stupidity!

       for the record, I HATE THE 90s comeback. why on earth do i want to remember my bad perm and foot high bangs, pleated pants (EW!!!), the intense longing to be popular that was the misery of junior high school, and the bad, bad, bad alt-rock movement (hello, pearl jam sucked!) there is a direct correlation between the music on FUSE TV today (i.e. "something corporate") and the grunge movement.  people  should not be celebrating this disgusting new "trend." (you know who you are.)
 BOOOOOOO - HATE ON YOU.
 ( urlLink Michael Ian Black  hasn't been funny since the '90s either. which explains why he is so eager to revisit those days...)
  
 a victim of the dreaded 1990s
 ...since blogger appears to be broken, i'll keep going... the only thing to wax nostalgic about the '90s is that people didn't get fired over making jokes about the president. seriously, what the fuck is that? did anyone see the tonight show during the '90s? how many CIGAR jokes would jay leno, david letterman, ET AL crack EVERY DAY? i'm sure i don't have to link the stories i'm referring to here, you're a well-read readership. (if not, google whoopi, linda ronstadt... and get out from under your rock already - it's an election year. time for fairweather politics at its finest.)

       sometimes i think about what kind of effects my blogging will have on my life. like, what if someone i used to know who happens to be an asshole finds this and makes fun of me behind my back to a bunch of other assholes i used to know. but then i think, well, i don't really give a shit, considering  urlLink what else is out there . like i said before, i started this blog so that i would stop sending mass emails about stupid shit out all the time, not so i could develop my writing skills or get a voice out or anything like that. this blog is extremely self-indulgent and is written poorly. but it has to exist. nobody is forcing you to read, unless your name is laura.
 for more blogging about blogging, please see today's  urlLink battery life  and make a donation towards the return of the  urlLink onceler ... and not that she ever reads this page, but i'd really like to see  urlLink someone  start blogging again because i know she's got some good insight on this shit!

 glenn & the misfits
 From the Quran - “Let him beware! If he desist not, we will Drag him by the forelock, A lying, sinful forelock” [96-15]  urlLink science4islam.com  has an interesting interpretation of the forelock in this verse. apparently the forelock rests directly over the part of the brain responsible for making decisions and also dishonesty.
  urlLink   
 Taking Time by the Forelock. Seize the present moment; "Carpe diem." Time personified is represented with a lock of hair on his forehead but none on the rest of his head, to signify that time past cannot be used, but time present may be seized by the forelock. 
  
 and the king of all forelocks

        urlLink low culture  has some interesting commentary on the recently deceased Vietnam-era NYT journo. here's a snip of her 'interview' with john and yoko, ca. 1969:
  Emerson: But you don't equate of the civil war that's going on in Nigeria with that, and then talk about "this is my form of a protest because people in anti-war campaigns are too SERIOUS and they get battered", what do you know about a protest movement anyway? It's a lot more than sending your chauffeur and your car back to Buckingham palace. 
 John: You're just a snob about it..... 
 Emerson: You're a Fake! I know in England it's kind of smart not to be too serious about anything. 
 Yoko: Everything needs a smile you know. 
 Emerson: [Condescendingly] I see.... Take the massacre ha ha ha. Can't you give up something else if it means a little bit more.... 
 John: It's not the sacrifice, you can't get that into your head can you? [snip]
 Emerson: Then what kind of a protest did you make? 
 John: AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FOR PEACE can you understand that? A very big advertising campaign for peace.. 
 Emerson: No I can't...I think it shows you're vulgar and self-aggrandizement, are you advertising John Lennon or peace?  
  urlLink that question never really got answered . though  urlLink the Boss has a few things to say  on the matter.

        urlLink THIS  is unacceptable. seriously, all i know is big corporations suck, time warner has lots and lots of money and should pay cablevision whatever they ask for so i can watch my mets. and $2.00 per month is not enough of a rebate considering I use 95% my cable viewing time for 1. SoapNet and 2. THE METS. fuck you.
 the dumbasses blacked out FSNY and MSG, leaving a catty message about Cablevision (like I really give a shit) and thus made impossible a proper tribute to Bob Murphy, one of the best who ever called a game. (He died Tuesday at 79.) here's a song lyric i wrote that was inspired by listening to Mr. Murphy on a hot summer's day a few years back:
  a beautiful play, that ends the inning
 i think i found a new beginning
 remember the days when that happened every day?

 it was truly amazing walking around in my  urlLink "Fuck Bush" tshirt  all weekend. Men that normally hiss and catcall would simply say, "yeah, fuck bush." Or "I agree with you," which I heard quite a bit. Now maybe they just wanted to fuck  my  bush, but I have a feeling there was a bit more to it than just libido. Hopefully.
