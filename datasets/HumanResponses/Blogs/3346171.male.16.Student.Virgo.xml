      New best friend  I met a friend today, the couch, yeah.. in the living room, yellow with some details in red and blue.. we talked all long day.. and we watched lots of TV...  There was a championship - sorry the spelling but i'm not in the mood to check this word in the dict- at the beach today morning, it ended about 10 minutes ago, the team with blue t- shirt and red boxes won... GO BOYS!!!!... i think that was soccer, MG! how can they do it? plat soccer for hours under the sun, and in the end they don't even get a coin as cash.. poor people! why don't they stay at home watching " All about comets " ? At least they would get some culture, i ain't saying that soccer is not culture, well.. it's not!!!  Today i got a thoughtfull email... please check out fellows: Necessary and superfluous some want cars, some just want to walk some want a nice watch, some just want to have a wrist some want a promotion at the job, some just want a job some want a better life, some just want a life some want the best house, some just a house some want the superfluous, some just the necessary (Chico Chavier)  Wow, that's so true. Chico Chavier, was so wise. He died couple eyears ago, he was a telephathic.  Tenga paciencia, the internet is down, and i'm writin' all this in wordPad, the lady said that they are improving some things. Did they need to "turn it off" to improve themselves? At times I agree with a friend, she gives support to cuminsm - this girl is crazy-. She can't understand that i like reading books in english, and she hates Mc'Donald's, well, i don't understand why a 2 slashes of bread a thin piece of meat are so expensive. With eight reais - the price of cheeseburger, big cock and big frenchs in Brazil- everybody could buy kilos and kilos of salad, or even buy 4 or 5 kilos of potato and do themselves kilos and kilos of french potato...Did i mention that i ate 800 g of ice cream last week? I'm so embaraced, i ate and ate, that was damn good, and i paid almost nothing - wednesday is the descount day of a ice cream factory here in my naighborhood-.  I've watched " Sex in the city" everyweek, -laughs- that's funny and the theme is showwed with no vulgarity, ok ok ok a little is vulgar a woman tells to her "fuck" that she can't suck him because his cumming tastes like garbage, but they say it so natural that it become a show for the family... actually, i wouldn't let my niece watch that...maybe because , when she's 8 or 9 she'll know more about sex than me, not bropping the subject , the last episode was named " Secret fuck". Carrye just went to her first date with Mr. Big and when she got in there she met an old friend of hers, and this friend didn't introduce his date to Carrye. he didn't because she was too ugly to be introduced to someone - Jeses, what a jerk- and walking in NYC with Mr. Big, they met a couple friends of Big's and he didn't introduce Carrye to them, she started to think that she was like her friend's date, but not too ugly to be introduced to someone, in the end of the episode, she found out that Big didn't introduce her because he couldn't remeber the name of his friends - what a lie-. In the other side of the city Miranda was at the gym, practicing boxe or a wrestle else, then she kicked her teacher, and of course her apology finished on bed, on his bed - GO GIRL!!!- and she found a videocassete, titled "Spake me".. well.. you fellow know where, And she made a joke with the spanking thing - laughs- and he didn't like the joke at all.. poor Miranda. I'm still thinking if i'm ugly enough to not be introduced to somebody's friend.  This week at school, my friend told us a story that really made me laught. She was telling to her mom about a book she read, a really good book, and the leading part of the book is a woman called Regina, and my mom's friend said " Regina, how many centimetres has your vagina?" hahahahahahahahha... i laughed so much that i cried. Her mom is old and really serious. Then we started to talk about parents and sex, and she told us - us= me and lorraynne- that she heard her dad and mom doing it, ew ew ew ew ew a thousand times ew. I and told them - them= lorraynne and carol- that i heard the same... i was in shock.. ew. Who says that teenagers has nothing in head, well, look our talk, it has quality. And who says that an adult can't be a teenager's friend, it's such a big lie. Look me and Joe, we are friends and his is an adult and i'm a teenager, and the same with me and Rose- Rose is a friend from the english course, she is 32, 2 daughters- we rock and when we are together, she always takes me to the bakery - this bakery is heaven, chocolate all around- or to Mc'Donalds to eat banana pies after the english course, she pays all, of course, she has a japanese restarant- sorry the spelling again-.   I'm feeling bad about the Math teacher, but he's a terrible teacher, he says something and then he said that he was wrong, it messes everybody's mind. Last week a girl delivered at everybody's desk a petition, asking us to sigh our names, if we get lost of sighs the head-teacher is going to talk with him.  I feel sorry for him, maybe it's not his fault if we didn't get good grades and all of us are going to have to do the tests again, maybe he was getting divorced and couldn't get focus, maybe his son has a serius deciase and he could pay attenion to himself, or worse, maybe his puddle died and he was hurt inside. I sighed my name, and i don't know if i did the right thing, and somepeople gave me as exemple " bla bla bla the math teacher isn't good, look, till André will have to do the test again, André" as if i was Da Vinci.   Well, voir vous demain école, or even today when i got back from gym.   P.S: i don't speack french at all, i have a little help from the PC's dictionary.

      Today morning i "spend" sleeping, I know i have to change this life, but come on, i've herad alot that sleeping is good for skin, hair, muscles, so i'm no quitting this actividy. In afternoon i watched a program about wrestlings, incredible what people do for living, 2 guys punching and kickin' each other like animals. And another program about Jacko, poor guy, but he's done lots of wrong things on his life, and the main ones are the cirurgy plastics he's done on his face, he wasn't that ugly, and the way he found to explaim the color change is so not believable.  When i sat on the pc chair my brother's says that he's going to the movies, and i say that i'm going with him, i don't know what happenned to my dad but he open his wallet in the first time a asked him some money. Getting in the movies, my brother says that he's not going to watch anymovie ANYMORE, that's fine, better be alone than with an annoyig one by your side, so i bought my ticket and we took a walk through the mall - we walked for about  one hour and a half- then he left and watched a fashion thing - thing means: those girls and boys waking with clothes that someone made for them, i don't know this word, HAuHAuHAuHAu, could some one teach me?!!!! - very nice, and little bit funny, there was this model walking like a gazel, jumping, i have this friend, she is a model too, and she doesn't walk that way.  Before my brother left he bought me a candy, named Fruitella, very good, Good lord my stomach by now is a bomb, I ate LOOOOOTS of that. And i went to the movies with my candies on my pockets, sucking each by each.  I watched "Troy", nice movie , but it's clear who's going to win the end, so i lost the insantivation to watch, but everything else is really nice!

      Everysingle weekend is like this, I sleep late on fryday night and feel sleepy for the rest of the weekend. I'll not do anything today and tomorrow, just watch TV, read a book, sleep...  I'm not feeling very good today, there is a horible headache knocking on m head, and is so cold ourside, I wanted to rent a movie but i spent all my money on a chocolate cake last night - i'm ashamed - i bought it because yesterday afternoon and fell sleep and had a dram about a chocolate pie, isn't it wierd?! When i wake up i felt in the obligation of buying that. And i ate that watching a Tv program named "eLove", it's very nice, it's about people who meet in the internet and they plan a trip to somewhere.   A friend of mine called me today morning to go to her place and have lunch tomorrow, I'm really not in the mood to take a bus and "act", that's what i have to do when i'm in a place where i don't know the people, i mean, her mom and brothers will be there, and i feel really imbaraced, so i sad that I was a headache and i wasn't in the feeling, in fact, my mom did lasanha, and I love italian food, i couldn't miss that.  Every year, my school goes to Porto Seguro, it's in Bahia, in northeast of Brazil, and my friends went and I didn't, this year they start - already - to say that I'll have to go, and I really would like to, now, i'll have to save every single coin i find, and i know i'll have to spend the money from my saving - :( -, i didn't want that, but Porto Seguro is all the good things in world, and we - me and my friends - will drink tons of caipirinha, which i love the most, it'll be awesome!

      Today school was quietly nice, first class i had a chemirty test and nobody studied i had studies last sunday. Everybody got bad grades so he said he's not going to corect our test and will give another one on nect fryday, thank God. And I had geography on second class, my geo teacher is so funny and trully smart, i've herad that he's the best geography teacher of the state. And i've found that Espírito Santo has lots of important things, like : the marble in my state is the oldest on Earth, it's 2,5 billion years old and the jerwels that the Queen Elizabeth wears are from here. Here in Brazil when they talk about ES, they say bad things only, but everybody knows that the State and Vitória are growing faslty.   I'm still sad. I think it's adolescent's thing. I feel alone, thinking that i have no friends and no one who cares about me :(:{  Hope this feeling to end as soon as possible.  Sentences of the week:  "I had a good eight inches last night" Ilrika Johnson "I've never had a humble opinion. If you've got an opinion, why be humble about it?"

      I'm really mad at my parents. Yesterday my dad said that he'd give me a cell phone and they went to the mall, but they didn't buy me the cell phone. Okay, watever, a cell ohone wouldn't make that diference in my life, but, why did he tell me that he would give me one? I should had known for the first time he said that, that he was lying. I got really upset!!   And really sad too, because that time it was a cell phone, but in the next time, it could be something bigger, i know it may sound silly, but i cryed a little before sleeping, not just because dad had lied, but also because i felt alone and kinda helpless.  Not much to talk about, i went to english course, and the teacher gave a pro test, it was a listening test. He dicted some sentences and everyone thought that was hard, and when they asked me if i thought that was hard, I said "no", because that wasn't, if the teacher hadn't repeated twice, that would be dificultm but he did and that was easy. And at the gym, It was just the usual, last afternoon, a frind that works out there too, said that beside the male restroom is the female's restroom and he heard her pooping... HAuHAuHAuHAuHAu. That was just the funniest..i laughed alot, and coming home i saw a girl , she almost fell down, and I couldn't hold my laugh.. and she realized that I was laughing. Poor her, but i couldn't help!

      There is television show here in Brazil, which is: the guy travels all around the world. Good Lord, I want a jot like that. He goes to everywhere, meet nice people, the Tv chanel gives him the best clothes, pays the best hotels, and he doesn't even choose the place he wants to go. This world is so unfair, I'll have to work for about 2 or 3 years to get less than 5 thousand dollars, and the guy travels and gets tons of money.   I just got back from gym - i took shower, don't worry- and is so funny see the peoeple's face, HAuHAuHAuHAuHAu... they bite their tongues, close their eyes, get red, and some guys breath, out and loud...What people do for get beautifull for the society is wierd.  A doubt is killing me: what is the plural of human being? It could be human beings, but being is the verb Be in gerundy, and it could be humans, but the plural of man is men, the pronounce does not change. Hummmmmm........ Why am i waisting my time? :$

      I saw in a magazine that a neeple has more than 500 thousands of sensitive cells, but if someone has a neeple with 3, 4 or even 5 cintimetres of diameter? This someone will have much more than 500 thousands, my point is: size does matter, it really does.

      The school took us to the movies, very nice movie , but they showwed an Ernest Guevara that no one knew, i'm kinda dissapointed -sorry the spelling-, i wish i had saw something about Cuba. Whatever! I almost froze in there, and some guys of the other school were throwing us some cups and we threw them back.  Last night was great! WOWOWOWOW!!! But no details here, my life is a book , but i didn't get this far yet.   When i was coming home - after school- i got a ride with my dad, and he bought another cell phone, and i asked him what he would do with his ex- cell phone, and he said " why? Do you want it?" and i said "Yes", i think i'll get a cell phone, awesome!!!!! I'll give you folks my number, but this phone is a card phone, you buy cards and call people. but it's for a few time, so, prepair yourselves , buy some calling cards, because you'll have to call me. There is a site, that you can send sms for free, however it's in portuguese, no worry, i'll teach you all. Hope my luck to not change, things are going well so far.

       The day was just the usual... getting there a friend told me that we're not going to the movies - the history teacher 'd take us to the movies to watch a movie about Che Guevara- because the head teacher changed the shedule, it was the second time of the week, and we are just in Tuesday, anyway we are going there tomorrow- wednesday-. Thank God i had only 4 classes, well,3 classes, spanish doesn't count.  English course is getting boring, it's too easy, so me and a friend- Rose - are going to do a nivelament test, we'll try to skip some classes. Rose is the best, we laugh alot and we talk bad things about everybody. We are mean! But i bet ya that they talk bad about us too. There is this new girl, and she speaking enlighs really confident - when people are learning, they talk really sloooowly and always say " Yesterday we are", or "She like"- and Rose told me to bring her down, using dificult words, hauhauhauhau, and i did, the teacher was talking about computers, and i said something about logging in, and the teacher never had said that world.. and Rose laughed alot...  I'll finish here.. i'm with an ANNOING head ache :(

      Sorry fellows i didn't post on Sunday, my bro stayed using the PC all long day and when i'd use he asked me to go to the movies with him. The movie was " Van Helsing", WOW, what a good movie, it's a movie about a good who has no family and he's  protected by Rome ( in 19th century ), and the church asks him to plead for a girl who all the family died. He has to kill Dracula and his fianceés ( i don't know if it's fiacé or fianceé, who is the female? ), and also a wolfman, this wolfman was the girl's brother, and dracula has to find Frankstein, because he is the key of the sourse of dracula's baby ( such a moving story, isn't it?!!!). I recomend this movie. Something shocked me at the mall. My bro's working and i didn't have anymoney to buy something for eating, and he payed all for me, WOWOWOWOW, that never happenedm and will never happen again :):(:[:{  Getting in school, who i see? Writing teacher - on the week test, she thought she had saw me "asking for help" ot a friend [ she's crazy], and she took my test from me- and i was kinda mad at her, the test was soooooo easy, and i knew all the aswers. That Bit***! If i get 0, i'll kill her. Gee, i'm getting dangerous!?!  Dangerous, no yo no soy peligroso, but i'm getting lazy and lazier, i'm skipping all the P.E. classes. What can i do if the teacher doesn't care if we - about 15 poeple- go home or not?  I read something today that made me think, it was: *don't wait for a shoulder, to start cring *don't say "I love you" , and then make Sb cry( this is the one who made me think) *don't wait for the hungry to come, and then start cooking *don't wait the chance comes, grab it firstly and others.  Did i mentioned that my uncle from Italy said to my dad tha very very very soon i'll live with him? Well, i think it isn't true, but if it's i'll love. I'll start in the italian class next august.   I'm sad this last couple days, a realized somethings that i can't tell :{. No need for worries folks, i'll be FINE AS WELL_

      Last week i watched a movie on HBO, it's is " le fabuleux destin D'Amèlie Pulain", very good movie. After the movie the director  said something that really passed the oposite message of the movie, he said that Paris is dirty, crowed, polluted, there is dog's poop all around and the city is rainy, Wow, this man should be exiled from France.  I've heard that the city is fantastic, but full of whores. Well, someone has to work!! HAUHAUHAUHAU!!!! If someone who has been to Paris reads my blogger, s'il voul plait, post about the city. I could go there by myself, but with 100 reais - how much i have - i can't even buy a backpack.  Whereby i'm posting it , i'm eating a cookie named "Break up!" wow, such a help. I have this friend, she broke up with his bf sending him one of this, nowadays they're still friends..this girl is crazy, but thinking, it was nice of her. Hummmm... no it wasn't , she made him a piece of crap.   I'm feeling bad about the Math teacher, but he's a terrible teacher, he says something and then he said that he was wrong, it messes everybody's mind. Last week a girl delivered at everybody's desk a petition, asking us to sigh our names, if we get lost of sighs the head-teacher is going to talk with him.  I feel sorry for him, maybe it's not his fault if we didn't get good grades and all of us are going to have to do the tests again, maybe he was getting divorced and couldn't get focus, maybe his son has a serius deciase and he could pay attenion to himself, or worse, maybe his puddle died and he was hurt inside. I sighed my name, and i don't know if i did the right thing, and somepeople gave me as exemple " bla bla bla the math teacher isn't good, look, till André will have to do the test again, André" as if i was Da Vinci.   Well, voir vous demain école, or even today when i got back from gym.   P.S: i don't speack french at all, i have a little help from the PC's dictionary.

      I'm addicted to this song.   3 Doors Down - Here Without You  A hundred days had made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lights had made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same But all the miles had separate They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight it’s only you and me  The miles just keep rolling as the people either way to say hello I hear this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as we go  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me  Everything I know, and anywhere I go  it gets hard but it won’t take away my love And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done it gets hard but it won’t take away my love  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me

      It's freezing here. The day was pretty ordinary. I spent my free time thinking about somethings that had happenned in my life, I wish i could back in time and change somethings, not things that bothered me, but things that i did and bothered people around me. Well,that's why life is what it is, we never can just erase things. This week passed so fast, and it's not good at all, like Luciana said ( luciana is a lady who works at the gym) "I'll be in 30's and i didn't enjoy life", hummm... what is she waiting for? She said that but didn't change anything i suppose, maybe we should not think like her, there's no time for thinking about how fast life is passing, just do something.

      The job was a trash, I'd work at a copy store. It'd be at 3:00 to 7:00. and i would have to work on saturday morning for getting R$150,00, God, I'd work like a slave, this kind of job you can't even stop for 5 minutes. My sister worked at a trainee company and she said tat this job is horrible. Well, what can i do?  Now i'll have to wait for another one.

      The day began early today, at 6:40am - like everyweekday -, i put my uniform on, ate breakfast and waited till the time that i couldn't enter for the first class, it was english, and everybody says that i don't need to watch those classes, and i did it today. After breaktime, i had a Math test, so eaaaaaasy -Thank God- and after it, a wrinting test, easier than the Math one, beacuse after the math test i met some guys of the other junior class and we traded our tests, so before the writing test begin i knew all about it.  And when i was going home i met a friend and we traded our homeworks, i gave him my litersture home work and she's gonna give me the chemistry one. Watched Friends, went to gym, took shower, thought about somethings... And here i am. Tonight i'm going to eat ice-cream, i'll try to brake the last week's record: eat more than 900g of ice- cream. Cheer for me folks!

      I hate being an adolescent, everyday i have a problem with myself, and i never wake up happy, i think the last time i did it was last years, the first day of vacations, hummmm... maybe it's normal, maybe this age is like this. I'm not sad all the time. But i never have a day that i'm good with me. Sometimes i wish i could dessepear, and unfortunetly i have no way out. I feel that i'm alone, that i haven't got anyfriends or just someone to tell about what happenned to me (this i know that doesn't happen to me only, I've heard other people saying the same, but it always feel that it's worse with ourselves). And the only person i can do those stuff, can't log in and i guess, is mad at me. Well, it's just a question of time, maybe.

      Sunday is always saunday, borin'. I woke up at lunch time, went to the beach, took the book i'm reading with me and had a tipical lonely sunday at the beach, it wasn't much hot, quietly warm. With a man making a rena tattoo - it's a tatoo that stays on he skin for about 2 weeks - on a guy's arm. I wouldn't let a guy draw a tattoo on my arm, they usually use dirty pens, and the beach is not the cleanest place to do it. Ew ew ew.  I watched Tv all long afternoon, poor old couch, it will be replaced, I'll miss it - HAuHAuHAuHAu-, mom is gonna buy another one.

      RECOMMENCE  “Doesn’t matter where you stopped… In what moment of your life you got tired What does matter, is knowing that always is possible and necessary, to restart Restart is giving a new chance to yourself… Is renovating the hopes in life and, the most important… Believe in yourself again. Got too much hurt this month? That was teaching… Cried too much? The was soul cleaning… Got mad at some people? That was for forgiving them someday Felt lonely many times? It’s because you closed the doors even to the angels… Believed in everything that was lost? It was the beginning of your improvement Where do you wanna get? High? Dream high… Wanted the best of the best… If we think low… Little things we’ll get… But if we wish strongly and Mainly fight for the best The best will install on our life Because I’m the same size of what I want,[ Ain’t the same size of my height."

      The volleyball today morning was very very nice. My knee is not ok by now. I still can't believe i hitted a "shina", shina is when the guy in the net lifts the ball, and he's not looking at you, so you have to jump to the corner of the net and hit in the diagonal. Wow, it was my first time hitting a shina. I slept all long afternoon. And now i'm hungry.   I watched that movie "the day after tomorrow", wow, it is soooo "nice", was very bad watching LA being distroyed. The wolves part was the most scary.   Phrases of the week: "Don't consider me the boss, consider me just as a co-worker who's always right" (good one)  "Fat woman is like Ferrari... when goes upon the scale goes from zero to 100 in one second"

      People have spent too much time worried with viruses in their pc programs and have forgotten about some kind of automatic thoughts who provoke real damages in their own minds. Pass now an anti-virus in your brain! If you detect any of these viruses, delete it immediately:  Virus 1: thought always/never: this virus happens when you think that something that happened in the past, is gonna repeat in future, or that you’ll never get what you want. Virus’s variants: nobody is gonna call me, i’ll never get a rise, everyone takes advantage at me, my children don’t listen to me. When you realize that you have this virus, delete it using the programs of your conscience.  Virus 2- The virus of negativism: happens when your feelings reflect just the bad side of a situation and ignore any other good part. Delete it with the program optimism.   Vírus 3 – the vírus of foresee the future: this terrible virus happens when you foresee the worst possible result of what people are thinking about a situation. It provokes a collapse  in your initiatives, making you give up before trying. The antivirus for this virus in “waking up”. Anyhow, if you could foresee the future, you’d be billionaire of the lottery.  Virus 4- the virus of the reading minds: this virus is always acting when you think that you know what people are thinking about you, even they didn’t tell you anything. The antivurs is always remembering that is already hard reading your own mind, even harder people’s.   Virus 5- the vírus with sensations: this vírus in general affects you, infecting in some unconfortable sutuation in the past. Now, similar situations will provoke negative feelings :” i havethe sensation that it’s not gonna work” – just delete it!  Virus 9 – the virus of guilt: reaplace words like: I should, I ness, I could, I have to… Use words like: I want, I will, I can do this like that… Do not stay centered in the past. Use the “antivirus present moment”.  Virus 7 – the virus of retulation : everytime that this virus puts a label on yourself or even on somebody else, it detains your capacity of having a clear vision of a situation: variants – dizzy, frigid, arrogant, irresponsible and millions more  of auto- installing  labels. The label generalizes, making people’s reality in virtuals images of unaffected imagination. The best anti-virus for it is the “ conscience amplification exe”.  Virus 8- the virus of personalization: it makes you take all to the personal side. Exemple: when some one looks at you with a bad face and does not says hello, the virus makes you believe that obviously this person is mad at you. The “ conscience amplification exe” deletes very well this virus  Virus 9: the vírus blame other exe.: this is the worst thought’s virus! When you blame automatically people for the problems of your life, this virus makes it impotent for reponsabilizing  you for your own destiny. Unable to change anything. Use the” self-esteem antivirus” and stop to project on other people your own blame.

      the tests are over, and a free weekend is coming. I'll go to the movies today, to watch "the day after tomorrow", me and my friend Lorraynne, and tomorrow morning i'll play volleyball with the volleyball friends. Wierd i separate my friends by the thing i hang time out with them. Like: the are the friends from class, the friends from school, the friends from the english course, the friends from Volley, and the internet ones, which are separated in portuguese, american and others. I'm mean. Anyway, they're all friends. :)  Ahhhhhhh, and the friends from the gym... oops, i don't have friends there.

      "The indecision remember the fouding: if doesn't clean the hads, is dirty, if cleans, spends water." (Malgaxe say)  It's so true, today at school, the geography teacher spent 50 minutes talking about the "waiste of water in today's world", i guess he didn't need to take all the time, i know it is an important subject, but come on.  Thank God the dificult tests are gone, but i'll sitll do: gramatic, geo, bio and history.   Here in Brazil, the lottery is acumulated in R$ 35 million, Jeses, if my dad wins it... I really don't know what to do, i really don't. I would help some people in Africa, travel, buy a house of chocolate, a pool of milk-shake of pineaple, definetly that would be awesome! Well, untill there let's wait, maybe someday i get that.  Who am i lying to?

      The day started "early", at 11am, i know i know it's not early but comparing to the usual time i wake up on weekends, it's early. And my mom, sis, b-in-law and niece called me to go to Pedra da cebola ( onion's rock ), to check out the "Green Fair", it's an anual fair about piece, nature and bla bla bla.. that was nice and "we" - my niece - had some fun feeding ducks, geese and fishes, then we ate breakfast, well expensive. And then we went to a restaurant - sorry the spelling but i'm not with patience to check if i wrote it right - but the first one didn't acept credic cards, so we had to another one, and i ate tons of cheese and frenchs, YUMMY! But when we were leaving, my sis realized that she had forgotten her credic card - how dumb! -, mom had to drive to another neighborhood and we stayed waiting there for centuries, and my sister and her bf stayed doing those stupid things that couples do. My mom came up and paid the bill... Thank God we went home.  I have 2 tests each day of the next week and i'm not studing as much as i was supposed to. Watever. I will, i promise.

      OK, i confess! My niece - yesterday night- had 1 bag of M&Ms, i confess i ate all of it. I know I shouldn't, but i love M&Ms.  The pics i got in Rio will be gere - i'm almost sure- in 2 days, i'll post them here, i promise i'll try. And my cousin brought from Rio a cold t-shirt, from where? Guess.. From United States. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH, i still do not believe. 3 months ago she found out that i'm "americanized" - it's a world we created here in Brazil for people who like USA, I'm soooo americanized- and she has a bf who went to USA , he has this t-shirt which one he didn't wear, whatever... She asked him this cold t-hisrt and HE gaaaaaaaaaaaave me!!!!!!! :):):):):):):):):):):) It's great, it's big, it has a huge states flag in the middle, a little big for me, but who cares, if there's the need, i'll get fatter!  I'd go to the movies, but my friend Adam, can't because he has to go to the english course, he watched it already. He's really nice and funny, and we've known each other for abotu 3 years, he's my best friend - do not worry Joe - and somedays i go to school for laughing only, like on wednesdays, on enlighs classes we laugh all the time. And we are gonna go to Chiabai - this ice cream factory that has a promotion on wednesdays. 50% half, we eat a looooooot -.  I'm so happy!!!!!! Finally, it was time for.

      The day was really relaxing; I didn't go to school, because my sister asked me to babysit my niece, but i had to deliver somephotos to my friends at school - tomorrow i have a home work to present-, then i went to english course, i had the final oral test, that was easy, about holidays... and to "celebrate" me and Rosi went to Monte Líbano - it's a bakery, that has chocolate and god things all around - and we ate some good stuff in the second floor - the second floor is a place where you can drink a coffee, eat a bombom, a cake - and we ate lots of good things. I cannot go there with money.   I was thinking about somethings today morning... about human beings, how silly we are. When we are young, we want to look older, when we are old, we want to look younger, younger but not fool. When we get a job, we want to rest , and when we don't have a job we want one badly. And there are lots of other examples.

      The week started well so far, the girls called me and some guys to play handball with them on PE class. I'll have to go to the gym in 2 hours, and it doesn't make me happy at all, if my dad weren't pay for the italian class, i guess i'd quit it, however a nice body "calls atention" doesn't it?!! -how dumb!!!-   I so not think that the phisical is all, if the mind is not in shape , there 's no need for working out your biceps right?! My dad got another car, now he has a vectra. I don't understand nothing about cars. Once me and my father went out, and he left the cars, and i wanted to turn the radio on -hahahahahha- and i put the keys in and spinned it, the car made a noise and moved, i got soooo frightenned, hahhahaah, that was funny, and i'll never to that again.  PS:the movie my bro got yesterday wasn't "monsters SA", it was "just married", it's funny.

      I spent all afternoon at the beach, i couldn't spend the morning, because i was sleeping, saturday night my dad rented a DVD, "Hollywood homicide", it's an action movie, with some funny parts.  I played volleyball at the beach;. Saturday i played at a block, and i hurted my knee, and today i had to jump for getting the ball and my knee started bleeding, It's ok now. My brother just went to the videostore, he'll rent "monsters SA", hummm... i don't know. I wanna rent "Frida", i like her a lot. I didn't pay attention, and the sun burned all of me, I hope not to wake up with that hurt tomorrow morning.   P.S: hugs to Ron and Robin, who told me, they read my blog!!!

      Let's start with the bad one: i got the grade of the history exam, and the result is not good. The good ones: the head teacher got in me class today and just kissed my ass. Wow, she said that i'm nice and a good student, anbd everybody heard, i got embarassed, but that was good to hear, and the other one, i'll have an interview tomorrow at 8:00 Am, cross your fingers and pray for it to be good and well paid. And that was on a good day, i have 3 physics class and one of chemistry.  I really want a job! I need one!

      I read the first chapter of that book (the american tragedy diplomacy), but then i got bored and fater "Friends" i had to go to the library - i shouldn't had gone, the college at night, is really dangerous- and i got a new book "tales of misteyr aand imagination "by Edgar Alan Poe", it's a nice book, and i really wanted to read a Poe's book.   Did i mention about an aunt who had a problem on her thumb, and the blood didn't come back to her heart, so the thumb got necrozed? Well, she was under a cirurgy and everything was fine, the doctor had to vut only the thumb off, if it bled, they'd have to cut off until the ewbol. Thank God!!!!!!!  I can't post anymore, because i went to the gym and didn't take shower. Ew! I know!!

      The english course finished ( thank God). The test was quietly easy.   I've got the testweek grades. I'm still in shock.... i got the highest chemistry grade in the class. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaw. And got 3,0 on biology and max garde was 3,0. Watever, i do not care that much and i don't wanna be titled "brain", like i am in the english class and some guys from school.  I got a book at the english course's libarary, named "The tragedy of american diplomacy", by William Appleman Williams, he's all i want to be in life.  "   We find genuine tragedy... only in that destruction which does not prematurely vut short development and success, but which, instead, grows out of success itself. Breakdown and failure reveal the true nature of things. In failure, life's really is not lost; on the contrary, here it makes itself wholly and decisively felt. there is no tragedy without transcendence. This trasnformation may go the way of deliverance, where man rises to rupreme reality through conquest of the tragic. Otherwise thi transformation may go the way of decline into irresponsible aestbeticism of the spector: man distracted, drifting, falling off into nothingness."         Karl Jaspers, Tragedy is not enough.

      I tried to post a pick of Frida, but there wasn't a link to, i sent an email to the blog diretorial saing that there wasn't a link for posting pics.   Did i mention that my aunt is coming here today?!! My dad went there(minas gerais), to see her family, and now 3 aunts and a bf of one are coming. VACANCY!!!!! (You guys know what it means. Who doesn't, send me an email), I guess my aunt will have to amput her arm. I feel so bad and sorry, but i'm praying for her to be good and there'd be no need for that.

      Sunday is sunday, and in my vocabulary, sanday = sleep. Is I have to sleep on sundays, i can't stay awake. And I tried to finish eating the brigadeiro. Last night I watched THE movie on HBo, "Frida", i was waiting to watch that movie , for about, 1 year, but everytime i went to the videostore, i got another movie, well, now i can say that i wacthed "Frida", i love her, she 's so real in her paitings, it doesn't feel that she is dead because of steel bar that introduced her back and passed through her vagina. Auch! That must hurt!  Guys, i made a flog, it's not a fotolog.net, because they are allowing american peple to have a flog.net, it's in portuguese, but you don't have to understand what i wrote, just look at the pics ok?! www.brfoto.net/a_luiz please go there.

      I just got from the June party my school made! That was nice, bbut is amazing what people can do to call for some atention. Some friends drinking beer, and pretending they were getting drunk! Just for saying that "i drink beer".. well what can i do? It's just ridiculus. A friend of mine screaming and saying to everyone that her parents were out! Depressing. I'll now say that i didn't drink, because i did, but 1/4 of one can. I don't like beer, the taste makes me ill. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------dropping the subject-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I got a nice e-mail, about how love. I know it's tacky!  The feeling were playing hide-and-seek, exept the fear and the lasyness, the madness was seeking. The hurry was the first to hide, the doubt didn't know where to go, the happyness ran to the garden, the sadness started crying, the envy followed the victory and hid behide him, under a stone. The madness continued to count untill one hundred, the despair got despaired and gave up, the curiosidy couldn't hold itself anymore, and was the first to be found. The feelings were being found one by one. But where was the love? The madness kept looking for it, at the mountains, rivers, swams, forests etc. Then, the madness looked at a rosebush, got a stick and started to spit the branches, suddenly, the madness heard a yel. The love had perforated it's eye on a thorn. The madness got imbaraced and beged for the love's forgiveness, and also promised to follow the love forever. The love acepted the excuses. Today, the love is blind and the madness follows the love all the time.  Isn't it nice?!!!!

I'm going to the movies - me, adam e a friend of his- we are going to watch "Spider Man 2", It rocks.... at least that's the hope. You'll ont believe in what i'll just tell you guys: my dad gave me 50 bucks couple a days ago. I got in shock, because he never does it, he said "Get it ,and put on your savings" People change!  Yesterday i watched for the third time, "American beauty", what a damn good movie!!!! I love it and i could watch for 10000000 times.

      This laws are made by Murphy;  Love: 1.All the good ones are taken.  2.If the person isn't taken, there's a reason. (corr. to 1)  3.The nicer someone is, the farther away (s)he is from you.  4.Brains x Beauty x Availability = Constant.  5.The amount of love someone feels for you is inversely proportional to how much you love them 6.Money can't buy love, but it sure gets you a great bargaining position.  7.The best things in the world are free --- and worth every penny of it.  8.Every kind action has a not-so-kind reaction.  9.Nice guys(girls) finish last.  10.If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  11.Availability is a function of time. The minute you get interested is the minute they find someone else.   Sex: 1.The more beautiful the woman is who loves you, the easier it is to leave her with no hard feelings.  2.Nothing improves with age.  3.No matter how many times you've had it, if it's offered take it, because it'll never be quite the same again.  4.Sex has no calories.  5.Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble.  6.There is no remedy for sex but more sex.  7.Sex appeal is 50% what you've got and 50% what people think you've got.  8.No sex with anyone in the same office.  9.Sex is like snow; you never know how many inches you are going to get or how long it is going to last.  10.A man in the house is worth two in the street.  11.If you get them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow.  12.Virginity can be cured.  13.When a man's wife learns to understand him, she usually stops listening to him.  14.Never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.  15.The qualities that most attract a woman to a man are usually the same ones she can't stand years later.  16.Sex is dirty only if it's done right.  17.It is always the wrong time of month.  18.The best way to hold a man is in your arms.  19.When the lights are out, all women are beautiful.  20.Sex is hereditary. If your parents never had it, chances are you won't either.  21.Sow your wild oats on Saturday night -- Then on Sunday pray for crop failure.  22.The younger the better.  23.The game of love is never called off on account of darkness.  24.It was not the apple on the tree but the pair on the ground that caused the trouble in the garden.  25.Sex discriminates against the shy and the ugly.  26.Before you find your handsome prince, you've got to kiss a lot of frogs. 27.There may be some things better than sex, and some things worse than sex. But there is nothing exactly like it.  28.Love your neighbor, but don't get caught.  29.Love is a hole in the heart.  30.If the effort that went in research on the female bosom had gone into our space program, we would now be running hot-dog stands on the moon.  31.Love is a matter of chemistry, sex is a matter of physics.  32.Do it only with the best.  33.Sex is a three-letter word which needs some old-fashioned four-letter words to convey its full meaning.  34.One good turn gets most of the blankets.  35.You cannot produce a baby in one month by impregnating nine women.  36.Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.  37.It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  38.Thou shalt not commit adultery.....unless in the mood.  39.Never lie down with a woman who's got more troubles than you.  40.Abstain from wine, women, and song; mostly song.  41.Never argue with a women when she's tired -- or rested.  42.A woman never forgets the men she could have had; a man, the women he couldn't.  43.What matters is not the length of the wand, but the magic in the stick.  44.It is better to be looked over than overlooked.  45.Never say no.  46.A man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn't love her.  47.Folks playing leapfrog must complete all jumps.  48.Beauty is skin deep; ugly goes right to the bone.  49.Never stand between a fire hydrant and a dog.  50.A man is only a man, but a good bicycle is a ride.  51.Love comes in spurts.  52.The world does not revolve on an axis.  53.Sex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation; the other eight are unimportant.  54.Smile, it makes people wonder what you are thinking.  55.Don't do it if you can't keep it up.  56.There is no difference between a wise man and a fool when they fall in love.  57.Never go to bed mad, stay up and fight.  58.Love is the delusion that one woman differs from another.  59."This won't hurt, I promise."

      The day was just "sunday", but a little bit diferent, i woke up quielty earlier than the usual. And started studing, i studied for 3 hours - is it believeble?-, grammatic, literature, termology and math. Then i went to the video store, anf got "8 mile", with Eminem.  I figured something really interesting about the party of yesterday. I met the math teacher and the gramatic one. And the math teacher started to say that i am, the son that every mather wants to have, that i'm nice, i work hard,i'm a nice friend but i don't like math. And the grammatic teacher affirming, that old bitch, she hates me! Whatever, it's the second that he - math teacher - does it. Perhaps he really likes me, a math teacher liking you, it's always good.

My sister desided that she's gonna work out too at the same gym i do,  but  she said that she needs gym clothes  and  a new tennis shoes  and  all that female's crap. And we are going to go to the korean store, they sell fake things for a  cheap price  and the things they sell there look real. Maybe I'll buy a tennis too.   I created another fotolog. The other one was so bad, it couldn't have more than 200 people loged , or it would not work.

      The gym was really nice today, and i thought it'd suck. Remeber that teacher i told ya guys , i said she was boring and stuff? Well, she is not! We talked alot: families, college, job, my stuff, her stuff. WE've met alot at the ice-cream store, and we  agreed  to go there anytime fot eating some.  I watched to 2 episodes of " SEX IN THE CITY ", that was just  GREAT !!!!!Samantha remuved her cancer( brest cancer), Miranda went for "her" honey moon ( she hates these romantic sutff), Carye tol Alek she wants to have a baby cause she's getting old but he said he doesn't want babies and Char.. well.. she showed the babiyes stuff to Carye! I guess i'll die when it ends, in august! Thank nice Lord there are the DVDs and when they arrive here and when i get the money i'l buy all!  I finished the book i was reading "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson, the book is not wanderful but it's teachful. It's about a treasure lost in an island, sometimes i thought I was watching to "Pireates of Carebian"; 'Sometimes I wake up at night. I can hear the sea around Treasure Island. I can hear the voice of Long John Silver's parrot calling - "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight" ' Who said it was Jim, the boy who becomes the hero and narrator of the story.

      When i'm studing i don't do anything during the day, now that i'm on vacation   ....    Well i'm not totally on vacation, i'll have to go there on this thursday and on next tuesday - not tomorrow-.   I'm nervous about the gym. I'll go there today and the teacher will give me another exercises to do, and i guess i'll not have legs exercises anymore, and i like the leg ones. I've seen many guys that work the up part only and they look like a V. And  i don't wanna look like that.    i've seem some nice shows on tv. The one i'm liking is " Talkig about sex with Sue ", an old man - i guess she is 70's - and people call her and ask things. It's so funny, last night a woman asked for Sue's help,  the woman said that her bf's dick was too big ,  13".   And she couldn't handle that. I laughed alooooooot!!!!    What a promiscue narration!!!!! I'm becoming futile

       Thank God i had some fun. The day was  awesome .. i spent all my day at the mall.    I said that i was going to an amusement park, but i incisted that today we'd have rain.     &nbsp;     PS1: we = me, adam, natália, natália's friend, i don't remember her name and a girl friend of them that lives in Swizerland  .     &nbsp;   After 2 hours staing in the line, we decided to go to the mall, and watch a movie.....   Garfield  .. perhaps it's because i'm 16... The movie   sucked  . Just horrible! And then we went to this amusement park again - it's beside the mall - and we realized that any drop of rain had fallen, and the girls i don't know the name went to the park. This girl wanted so bad to get in there, that's because she is going home tomorrow.     &nbsp;   That was just me, Adam and Natália. We had the BEST time ever. We laughed soooooo much.... at the silliest stuff.    And we said that we are going to the park on monday and on saturday (maybe) to Roda Pizza.... the best place in the universe to eat pizza. Pizzas of chocolate, coconut, banana, passionfruit. soooooooooooo YUMMY!!!     &nbsp;   In the end... when we were going home....   rained!!!!!!!   And everybody was blamming me for Garfield! The thin' is.. i was right in the end!     &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.garfieldmovie.com/ &nbsp; (   Garfield)

       I definetly put my sleep on the right way today......   i got up at noon  . I know  John ... i know.. i know you are saying that proverb that i can't remember now. But i was needing it. I woke&nbsp; up  so    well ,  i was feeling   fresh ,  new ,  clean ,  young ,  etc .   At night me, dad, sis, mom and niece when to the mall. Mom wanted to buy something to wear under the jacket or whatever that thing is named. And "we" found some friends and  they  stayed talking, about stuff.  While they were cathing up, I stayed thinking about  COWS!!!!!  Why? I don't know. I just did. I don't even like cows, they make those noises and are wierd.   Ew ew ew  ! I hate cows.  And when we were leaving, i asked dad for a milk- shake and i ordered a  large  order.   YUMMY!   I deserved, i've been a good son!!!!!! hahahahahah.... Who am i tring to cheat on?!!!!!!  Tomorrow is the "the" day, me and dad are going to the language course, i'll study   italian . I  had to take 30 reais from my savings. I hate taking money off of it but if i hadn't i guess my father wouldn't pay the other   141,00 reais.

        Dad just took me to fill the formulary of the  techinical mechanics.  And it's all mathematics. Most fathers want their sons and daughters to be    a doctor or a lawyer ,  well, mine wants me     to be a mechanic   .  GEE!!!!! How lucky i am.       He doesn't understand that everyone has a dream, and he can't just plan things for people - people = me-. "Everything bad thing has a good thing on it", and   i'm looking for the good   things on it ,  and i guess i've found some : he'll have to pay the italian course, and i'm -almost- that he'll have to give me some money when i ask him to!      I'm a bit sad!   It could be worse  , hummmmm... let me think in a way that it would be worse, way worse would make me happy... hummmmm.... he could want me to be a beggar. "Go boy, be a beggar, the trade of beggins is growwing".   It doesn't have sence  .        &nbsp;    &nbsp;   PS: nothing against the mechanics or the beggars and homelesses, it's just me.

       (Saturday)   I rented 3 movies:   Dogville, Uptpwn girls and Goodbye Lenin!   The last one is just great!!!!! It's in German , 10 years ago, and it's about a guy who has a mom and she has a stroke and gets in coma, when the berlin's wall falls apart she still is in coma and 8 months later she wakes up, and the doctor says she can't have strong emotions, so the son can't tell her about the unification of German and he creates a big law, it's nice, emotive and good.   Up town girls is funny, it's about a woman who leanrs many things with a little girl and the woman ( molly) becomes a grown up which she wasn't! Very good and hearttoucing!   I started watching Dogville but i didn't like it. So i had to go to the Videostore and i had to take another one "Maid in Manhatan" it seem to be good. I'll watch it tomorrow.

       3 weeks passed so fast... i wish i could have more 3 weeks of vacation. I could have been more fun, but thinking it also could have been more boring!   Yesterday ( fryday), we (  me, adam, natália, her sister and Júlia ) went to the mall, i know i know i know, you must think that we go to the mall everyweek and "yes",  it's true!  We went to the movies, we i mean... natália and her sister couldn't go, because her sister wasn't allowed to get in. We watched " Hell boy ", it's about  a portal that a friend of Hitler opened and the Devil would control the world, but a cristian guy found the Devil when it was a baby, there are some other monster.   The movie is not good, it seems to have special effects, it doesn't have much though.    And the story is not good.  After the movies we met the girl and Natália's mom took her friend home.   We ordered a   "Maracanã" Pizza   ( Maracanã is a soccer stadium, from my sourses it was the biggest stadiun on earth so is the pizza), we ate a l-o-t! Then we ate fundue of chocolate, YUMMY. And we checked some tennis shoes ( i dribbled for all, but i know that dad will not buy me one), and we went to Lei Básica ( cring), i saw a   jacket  ,  so  perfect!  so  expensive!      Then, home!

       I was watching TV, something about beautifull people, and, i questioned myself:&nbsp;what does make a person beautifull?!   Is obvious that everybody realized that  "the ones"  ( ones= the lucky ones on Earth) have the  best jobs and, the best cars and cribs, they always luck good on pics and sure: hot stuff only atracts hot stuff!  I don't like when someone says "Ya're ok!", it means that i ain't a lucky one, though i'm not trash! It's kinda good, but we want more, we want to be on top! The thing is:  where is the top?! Who to get there?!  I don't know. If someone does, please give me a call!    Bulshit! I don'tcare for that stuff that much. I guess that a muscle chest and a straight hair, without a brain in shape is like... nothing! I like working my brain out, and i admite that i work out ( but for motives that i have told before), and if my dad doesn't pay the italian course, ( i also have to admit)  i'll not stop working out! I got used to it!  Some friends say that i got a larger arm and my chest has grown, I just love it! I'm so embarassed, i was a defensor of the "iteligence no matter what".    The society demands you to have the society's body (  which is a : slim body, white teeth, nails done and a cinnamon tan ), and i must confess that i want to be part of the society!    Don't you?!

       I spent all my day out. There was this test for the mechanics course, that was so hard, math only!!  uncomprehenssible  ( does this word exists?)  !      &nbsp;   And after the test some friends (  adam, natália and isabela ) were waiting me at the amusement par... we spent.. humm... 30 minutes standing.. and Adam got an idea&nbsp; " why don't we check if there's someone we know standing in the line?" .. the line was giiiiiiiant. But we didn't find anyone.. Natalia decided to get in the head of the line - thank God she did that-;    The park was cool.... but last year it was better.    We got in one machine, named "Ranger"..    Wow! It was like a swinging chair, but of course that wasn't a chair.. it was like a jail ( or we would fall and die) with a chair to sit and a bar to hold us... that thing started spinning, and spining and over and over.. and it turned everybody up side down!!!!! Wow..... it spined for 3 times, in the 4 time.. we stayed for about 6 seconds with out feet up and head down... AWESOME!!!     And after Ranger we went to the "Pirate Ship"... that was relaxxing..   i   felt my stomach on my mouth and my balls on my liver.. but that was relaxxing!    After that, Natália felt sick and we understood... we couldn't let her feeling hungry and cold.. she was pale and.. ok.. let's go to the mall!    Adam had to liave because his mom and dad wanted to go to grandpha's place... I think he didn't had to go.. but it's ok. Me and isa had a hot dog , and natália said she would eat at home!!!!     &nbsp;   The day rocked!!!     &nbsp;

       The day was full.    &nbsp;  1- i woke up at 7:30 am to take care of my niece   2- waited for Diana ( maid) to get in home and when she did i went to gym   3- i stoped a while at a friend's reataurant ( Rose!!) , she invitedto seat next to her at the balcony and there were looooots of americans there, and they were talking to loud and saying swordwords ( like: fuck, shit, hell and a song that i've heard alot , it's like this : my neck, my back, my pussy and my crack) very nasty and unbehavely... i'm not talking bad stuff of USA, the    opposite, who knows me well, knows that the dream of my life is living in Chicago, LA, Miami etc     4-i went to UFES, and who was there? The americans. I went to the libarry and got a new book; British: short stories of today. seems to be funny and nice      5-and then i went to the main room, to put my name on the italian class, but it was too late, there no vacancy, and i had to choose another course ( between: french, spanish and germany),    and i chose germany. A teacher had said that soon Germany will be the second country with most influence on the world! Whatever!       &nbsp;   Now i'm real fucked! it's just so dificult.. but i'll study and with german on my curriculum..i'll be more than good!

       The "doing nothigng" days is  back . I spent all my day   on   the couch...    &nbsp;  I was reding the news -  i read only the part of People .. famous people and the international news  - today and i read a readline that made me think!   That was about the american  army, navy and the air force , if they want to, they have free plastic surgery, and their family does too. The thing is : the doctors are the ones who    just    graduated. How bad  /  good?!!!!!!! OK.. they can have it for free but the doctors are still practicing, of course they graduaded. In the news they said " It will be good for both parts: the army looks better and the doctors "PRACTICE""....    Poor  navy/army/ air force , they go to another country, fight, give they life and if they hurt and want to have a scar removed the doctor will be practicing,   on the patient...    &nbsp;

       I was wondering some   stuff  ......    Cyber sex is not the healthiest thing, having sex with someone you never ever saw, it would like being  raped for someone that can't even touch you .....   Kinda wierd!      It's the last month of "Sex in the city", do you guys think that wether i send an e-mail to the director of it, saying that it can't just end,   they will keep it on?
