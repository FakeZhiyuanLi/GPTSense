      I can't stand pop music its got to be the annoying type of music ever made and then there's punk bands guess what that's still pop just they like to pose ass a rock band if I can tell why can't they.  As you can see I don't use periods as much as I should but I hate them I'm a ranter so I don't pause I just keep going and going and going. I'm a fluffy pink drum playing bunny at hart :P.  So... My father found my stash the other day it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be he just kinda hollered for a sec and took my weed but not my whisky :)I'm very happy about that and yes I'm an alcoholic.  Okay I'm running out of things to say it happens allot, not much interesting happens nemore I mayz well tell you a story about the first time I met a pig under bad conditions. So you squares don't get confused not the animal a cop so all you know the dif I can tell my story.  Well I was in the field by my house leaned up against the tree selling some weed when a cop comes up so I crutch the weed and he comes over to me and sa'foe (a guy I know)and he says there's been some reports of drug trafficking around here would you know ne thing about that. So since me and sa'foe are 12 we put on our best little boy faces and say no sir and then he says empty your pockets so I empty them (luckily I sold almost all the weed except the 4 grams shoved down my pants) and we pull out some fire crackers and a couple of liters and he takes them and says that he thinks we're to young to know ne thing about drug trafficking and goes on his donnut eating way.  Well that's that.  TTYL.

      Should I list everything that sucked ass this week. I think not cuz that would be really lame like somthin axel aka xxxela aka Alex would do.  Ok I was playing the chronicles of riddick the other day and it was all cool cuz your in prison and you could beat other prisoners to DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How cool is that but once you get far enough into the game you get into one of those lame sewer levels you know the ones you half to find your way out with mutants chasing you with a time limit.  Wait I'm comin off all geeky so ok I've been grown weed since I was 12 and it was cool and all but now when ever somthin happens I'm always blamed what can yah do newho the other day I was gettin drunk with a couple of my friends and this guy comes over to us and insults Jen my ex well not my ex at the time. Well I was drunk as you already know and it was whisky that brot the Irish up in me. So pulled out my knife and stab the fuck in the leg and what do I notice when hes on the ground hes my friend Mike who was gettin drunk with us but left to get more whisky thats why I'm write'n this cuz no one will talk to since the whisky accident
