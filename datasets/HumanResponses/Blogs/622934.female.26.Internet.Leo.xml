         The Prayer  (Performed by Charlotte Church and Josh Groban)                       I pray you'll be our eyes                   And watch us where we go                   And help us to be wise                   In times when we don't know                   Let this be our prayer                   As we go our way                   Lead us to a place                   Guide us with your Grace                   To a place where we'll be safe.                       La luce che to dai                     I pray we'll find your light                    Nel cuore resterò                    And hold it in our hearts                    A ricordarchi che                     When stars go out each night                    L'eterna stella sei                      Nella mia preghiera                     Let this be our prayer                    Quanta fede c'è                     When shadows fill our day                   Lead us to a place                   Guide us with your grace                    Give us faith so we'll be safe.                        Sognamo un mondo senza più violenza                    Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza                    Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino                    Simbolo di pace e di fraternità                    La forza che ci dai                                                           We ask that life be kind                    E'il desiderio che                     And watch us from above                    Ognuno trovi amore                     We hope each soul will find                    Intorno e dentro a sé                    Another soul to love                      Let this be our prayer                   Just like every child                   Just like every child                   Needs to find a place,                   Guide us with your grace                   Give us faith so we'll be safe                    E la fede che                    Hai acceso in noi                    Sento che ci salverà                        +++++++++++++++++                                         Translation:                      The light that you give us                   Will stay in our hearts                   Reminding us                   That in my prayer                   You are an everlasting star                   There's so much faith                     We dream of a world with no more violence                   A world of justice and hope                   Grasp your neighbors hand                   As a symbol of peace and brotherhood.                   The strength that you give us                   Is the wish                   That everyone may find love                   In and around himself                     And the faith that                   You've lit inside us                   I feel will save us.

         Humanity     Another reason why I hate wars is that they leave a long trail of widows and orphans. In war, it is not the leaders who suffer themeselves and are ultimately affected by the atrocities but those who are in the middle of the battle and those unfortunate civilians--noncombatant men and women, old and children--who have no means of protecting themselves other than, hanging on a thin strand of hope, hiding and running away from the battle zone. But what if they have nowhere else to go or no means to avoid the conflict?  I found another interesting view about the war.     The real tragedy has not befallen America's leaders (it is hard to describe Bush and Rumsfeld as the best and brightest, or even as just good and bright) who have had to wring their hands in agony from the path they have been forced to take, it has befallen Iraq's people who have had to weep and gnash their teeth from the bombs that are falling on them. The real tragedy has not befallen an America caught in the throes of a painful duty, it has fallen an Iraq caught in the vise of gratuitous mayhem.     Unlike the Vietnam War, there is no likelihood Iraq will win this war militarily. Though the unexpected (from the American and British point of view) resistance it has put up must show that the Iraqis at least do not see this as a war against Saddam Hussein but a war against them. A ridiculous proposition to begin with, the White House mantra in this respect. Try telling Americans Osama Bin Laden says 9/11 was not an attack against them but only against George W. Bush. Indeed, try telling Americans Osama Bin Laden says he took care to destroy only symbols of American imperialism, such as the White House, the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, taking care to keep casualties to a minimum.     So far, this war-thanks in no small way to CNN, BBC and much of Western media-has been seen through the eyes of the Americans and British. Through the eyes, that is, of the "invaders," as Iraq officials justifiably put it-justifiably because ironically George W. Bush and Tony Blair have just managed to replace Saddam Hussein and his sons as the most hated figures in Iraq. The "seeing" is paradoxical because it is at once a seeing and not seeing. While it sees all the details about the aggressor, in the process humanizing him, it sees next to nothing about the victim, in the process turning him into an abstract thing.    On one hand, you see etched against the gathering dusk the profile of Allied soldiers standing next to one another, a la "Band of Brothers." On the other, you hear only about nameless Iraqi soldiers who are tired, demoralized and want to surrender. On one hand, you see White House and Pentagon officials at pains to show alternately their determination and compassion in carrying out what amounts to God's will. On the other, you see only buildings being pounded to dust by bombs, plumes of smoke sprouting into a garish sky.    I'm glad at least that that footage of the Iraqi dead and wounded came out on BBC. Those were the casualties only from the bombing of Baghdad last weekend; there will be more in days to come as the fighting continues. They may not be the mass of slaughtered humanity to prick the conscience of a jaded world, but they are a good reminder of two things: First, that the victims of this war, in whose name it is being waged by a thug in Washington and a poodle in London, are made of flesh and blood. And second, that the real tragedy of this war is not that Bush's and Blair's hearts are being torn by it, but that the Iraqis' bodies are being torn by it.    The strategy of "shock and awe" reeks of humanity? Only in the sense that Lucy of Peanuts puts it: " I love humanity; it's people I hate. "

         War Stinks!     Apparently, yesterday's attack on Iraq was just an opening salvo for the massacre of Iraqis. Today is the *real* military action against Saddam. Hell, what do they need opening salvos for?  As of this writing, 12 British and 4 American soldier died in a hellicopter crash. God knows how many might possibly have died during the opening salvo on Iraq. War is really stupid.  Here's the full text of Robert Cook's resignation speech at the House of Commons in reaction to Britain's decision to go to war.       Robert Cook's Resignation Speech      This is the first time for 20 years that I have addressed the House from the back benches. I must confess that I had forgotten how much better the view is from here.    None of those 20 years were more enjoyable or more rewarding than the past two, in which I have had the immense privilege of serving this House as Leader of the House, which were made all the more enjoyable, Mr Speaker, by the opportunity of working closely with you. It was frequently the necessity for me as Leader of the House to talk my way out of accusations that a statement had been preceded by a press interview. On this occasion I can say with complete confidence that no press interview has been given before this statement.    I have chosen to address the House first on why I cannot support a war without international agreement or domestic support.     Backing Blair     The present Prime Minister is the most successful leader of the Labour party in my lifetime. I hope that he will continue to be the leader of our party, and I hope that he will continue to be successful. I have no sympathy with, and I will give no comfort to, those who want to use this crisis to displace him.    I applaud the heroic efforts that the prime minister has made in trying to secure a second resolution. I do not think that anybody could have done better than the foreign secretary in working to get support for a second resolution within the Security Council.    But the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed. Now that those attempts have failed, we cannot pretend that getting a second resolution was of no importance.     French intransigence?     France has been at the receiving end of bucket loads of commentary in recent days. It is not France alone that wants more time for inspections. Germany wants more time for inspections; Russia wants more time for inspections; indeed, at no time have we signed up even the minimum necessary to carry a second resolution. We delude ourselves if we think that the degree of international hostility is all the result of President Chirac.    The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner - not NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council. To end up in such diplomatic weakness is a serious reverse. Only a year ago, we and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible.     'Heavy price'     History will be astonished at the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful coalition. The US can afford to go it alone, but Britain is not a superpower. Our interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules. Yet tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened: the European Union is divided; the Security Council is in stalemate. Those are heavy casualties of a war in which a shot has yet to be fired.    I have heard some parallels between military action in these circumstances and the military action that we took in Kosovo. There was no doubt about the multilateral support that we had for the action that we took in Kosovo. It was supported by NATO; it was supported by the European Union; it was supported by every single one of the seven neighbours in the region. France and Germany were our active allies. It is precisely because we have none of that support in this case that it was all the more important to get agreement in the Security Council as the last hope of demonstrating international agreement.     Public doubts     The legal basis for our action in Kosovo was the need to respond to an urgent and compelling humanitarian crisis. Our difficulty in getting support this time is that neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq.    The threshold for war should always be high. None of us can predict the death toll of civilians from the forthcoming bombardment of Iraq, but the US warning of a bombing campaign that will "shock and awe" makes it likely that casualties will be numbered at least in the thousands. I am confident that British servicemen and women will acquit themselves with professionalism and with courage. I hope that they all come back. I hope that Saddam, even now, will quit Baghdad and avert war, but it is false to argue that only those who support war support our troops.    It is entirely legitimate to support our troops while seeking an alternative to the conflict that will put those troops at risk. Nor is it fair to accuse those of us who want longer for inspections of not having an alternative strategy. For four years as foreign secretary I was partly responsible for the western strategy of containment. Over the past decade that strategy destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf war, dismantled Iraq's nuclear weapons programme and halted Saddam's medium and long-range missiles programmes. Iraq's military strength is now less than half its size than at the time of the last Gulf war.     Threat questioned     Ironically, it is only because Iraq's military forces are so weak that we can even contemplate its invasion. Some advocates of conflict claim that Saddam's forces are so weak, so demoralised and so badly equipped that the war will be over in a few days.  We cannot base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat.     Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term - namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target. It probably still has biological toxins and battlefield chemical munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold Saddam anthrax agents and the then British Government approved chemical and munitions factories.    Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for 20 years, and which we helped to create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam's ambition to complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of UN inspectors?     Israeli breaches     Only a couple of weeks ago, Hans Blix told the Security Council that the key remaining disarmament tasks could be completed within months. I have heard it said that Iraq has had not months but 12 years in which to complete disarmament, and that our patience is exhausted. Yet it is more than 30 years since resolution 242 called on Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.    We do not express the same impatience with the persistent refusal of Israel to comply.   I welcome the strong personal commitment that the prime minister has given to middle east peace, but Britain's positive role in the middle east does not redress the strong sense of injustice throughout the Muslim world at what it sees as one rule for the allies of the US and another rule for the rest. Nor is our credibility helped by the appearance that our partners in Washington are less interested in disarmament than they are in regime change in Iraq.   That explains why any evidence that inspections may be showing progress is greeted in Washington not with satisfaction but with consternation: it reduces the case for war.     Presidential differences     What has come to trouble me most over past weeks is the suspicion that if the hanging chads in Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected, we would not now be about to commit British troops. The longer that I have served in this place, the greater the respect I have for the good sense and collective wisdom of the British people.   On Iraq, I believe that the prevailing mood of the British people is sound. They do not doubt that Saddam is a brutal dictator, but they are not persuaded that he is a clear and present danger to Britain. They want inspections to be given a chance, and they suspect that they are being pushed too quickly into conflict by a US Administration with an agenda of its own.    Above all, they are uneasy at Britain going out on a limb on a military adventure without a broader international coalition and against the hostility of many of our traditional allies. From the start of the present crisis, I have insisted, as Leader of the House, on the right of this place to vote on whether Britain should go to war.    It has been a favourite theme of commentators that this House no longer occupies a central role in British politics.Nothing could better demonstrate that they are wrong than for this House to stop the commitment of troops in a war that has neither international agreement nor domestic support.    I intend to join those tomorrow night who will vote against military action now. It is for that reason, and for that reason alone, and with a heavy heart, that I resign from the government.     ---------------------  (Cook was Foreign Secretary during Tony Blair's first term in government)

         War Sucks!     It's less than 24 hours before the inevitable war happens, and everyone, just like me, is counting down to the first strike against Iraq.  I found this funny but sensible open letter to Dubya from  urlLink Michael Moore .       A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush  on the Eve of War     George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC    Dear Governor Bush:   So today is what you call "the moment of truth," the day that "France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table." I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:   1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!   2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve.   3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.   4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.   5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!   6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.   Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you "win" the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good ass-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world ass!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!   But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!    Yours,   Michael Moore     ( edit: I don't know why some portions of this entry has green font.  Blogger is having some issues.)

         Bad News     I called up the MBA office just a while ago to inquire about the entrance exam results that I took on 16 February. I had been wondering why I hadn't received any call for interview. I assumed (and still does) that an applicant would get an invitation for interview should she pass the exams. Unfortunately, I hadn't got any.  So when I got to talk to "Anabelle", I enquired about the results, and she informed me that my name wasn't there. Aww, schucks!  I asked if more names would still be added to the list or if that there would be a new list of interviewees. She said she wasn't sure. What a shame! Does it mean I didn't pass the exam? Oh well, I knew from the very moment I went there that I'd do bad because I didn't prepare for the other 33.33% of the exam, which was logic, and that I didn't finish the exam sections except for the reading comprehension.  I called up again, since I thought there was something missing with the scenario. If that was the final list, I thought, how come they still asked us to submit recommendation forms until the 31st. I called up again to re-check and a different person received my call. When I asked her about the exam results, she told me it wasn't yet the final list and that it was advisable that I submit my recommendation forms.  I still have 1% hope. Go me!  But then, I'm already scouting for other graduate school here and especially abroad. Who knows, I might hit a jackpot and get into a better program in a better school. I've always told myself that UP was only Plan B.    I'm going out tonight!   Hey hey! Friday night! Tina confirmed that we'd be going out tonight with our friends from  urlLink UPGL . We still don't know where to go after the org-sponsored "acoustic" concert. As long as the place offers booze and it's not some cheesy watering hole, or a gay bar, or a smelly pub, it's fine with me. Otherwise, we could do with good old karaoke-ing.

         The Overlooked Faces of Globalization     I was browsing some university web sites this morning and stumbled on this nice piece. This is especially interesting for someone whose country's one mode of survival is exporting labor. You can find the bulk of the short essay  urlLink here .  A snippet of the article:    Global cities are characterised by three groups  well-paid expatriates in professional and managerial positions, talented performing artistes and tourists. These people enjoy privileged positions as they draw investments and add prestige to global cities.    What is often ignored, however, is that these favoured groups are sustained by the labour and support of migrant workers who are often low in skills, status and salary. These unskilled and semi-skilled foreigners form the underbelly of global cities, servicing the needs of the privileged in both residential and commercial settings. To forestall social problems, this group has to be managed well. Assoc Prof Yeoh argues that migrant workers should not be seen as only a transient workforce, but should be incorporated into the social fabric of the global city.      A nice, funny email from Lia:   If you want someone who will bring you the paper without first tearing it apart to remove the sports section...buy a dog.   If you want someone willing to make a fool of himself simply over the joy of seeing you...buy a dog.   If you want someone who will eat whatever you put in front of him and never says it's not quite as good as his mother made  it...buy a dog.   If you want someone always willing to go out, at any hour, for as long and wherever you want...buy a dog.   If you want someone to scare away burglars with a lethal weapon, which terrifies you and endangers the lives of your family and all the neighbors...buy a dog.   If you want someone who will never touch the remote, doesn't give a damn about football, and can sit next to you and watch a romantic movie...buy a dog.   If you want someone who is content to get up on your bed just to warm your feet and whom you can push off if he snores...buy a dog.   If you want someone who never criticizes what you do, doesn't care if you are pretty or ugly, fat or thin, young or old, who acts as if every word you say is especially worthy of listening to, and loves you unconditionally, perpetually...buy a dog.   But on the other hand If you want someone who will never come when you call, ignores you totally when you come home, leaves hair all over the place, walks all over you, runs around all night, only comes home to eat and sleep, and acts as if your entire existance is solely to ensure his happiness, then my friend...buy a cat.   (Any resemblance to a man is purely coincidental.)

          Waiting in Vain         BK sent me his CV last night. I didn't care to read it as I was already about to go home when I received it.  I checked it out this afternoon and it made me almost ashamed of myself.    Discussions, debates at the local forum is still heated. Man! The commies are the most backward people I know to have ever existed. They're worse than the CBCP members.    Cold War folder is ok. Made it! Haha!    Tina R. texted me yesterday about a plan for Frida night gig after our college org's concert. I'm definitely in need of some legitimate nightlife. Will join them tomorrow.    GMA said no more combat role for the GIs here. Honestly, I wished they would employ the GIs against the Abus.     I think I'm going to Cinderella to finally buy that pair of shoes.

       I've been having some heated arguments with commie members of this forum.  Clearly, some people's ignorance and stupidity approximate infinite proportions.  Here are the topics we are debating about:      urlLink Is the NPA a terrorist group?    urlLink Are rallies and strikes ok?    urlLink Solution to economic, political and cultural problems of the philippines, anyone??     urlLink Piso for Joma?    urlLink Revolutionary Taxes: Just?

        Collateral Damage    This is really sad.  I received a text message last night from Tina about a bomb blast in the country. I could only assume that it happened somewere in Mindanao, so I was of course safe.    A bomb went off at Davao Airport yesterday, around 5:30 p.m., killing 121 people as of this writing and injuring around 170.    I can't believe that there are people who will ruthlessly kill innocent civilians just to promote their little wars. I have a mind that the perpetrators are the Muslim separatists in the south, so it's not a matter anymore of whether they think that killing their own countrymen was just. For them, it meant killing those who were against a separate Muslim state.  An American missionary was one of the fatalities.

        Passenger Seat     "And I've got all that I need  Right here in the peassenger seat  Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road,  Knowing that he's inches from me."     --Stephen Speaks, "Passenger Seat"    Just a quick run-down of what happened in the past few days. It is quick because nothing significant happened in the last few days (as well as those immidiately preceeding them).   I miss Bernard. I miss him and it's been two weeks since I last got in touch with him. He dropped by our Message Board the other day to post one message. I hope he'll keep dropping by. But more than anything, I'd like to meet him again. I'm planning to set up a meeting, so... *crosses fingers*.   Weekend kind of sucked. It was boring, of course. I didn't watch a movie, didn't shop either.   My friends and I planned to go on a weekend trip at Hundred Islands, about 7 hours away from here. It's a cluster of small islands spread over a sprawling clear blue portion of the South China Sea. It should be fun! Summer is already setting in and the days are getting hotter.   Today, is pretty boring as well.

       The War Works Hard   How magnificent the war is How eager  and efficient! Early in the morning it wakes up the sirens  and dispatches ambulances  to various places  swings corpses through the air  rolls stretchers to the wounded  summons rain  from the eyes of mothers  digs into the earth  dislodging many things  from under the ruins  some are lifeless and glistening  others are pale and still throbbing it produces the most questions  in the minds of children  entertains the gods  by shooting fireworks and missiles  into the sky sows mines in the fields  and reaps punctures and blisters  urges families to emigrate  stands beside the clergymen  as they curse the devil  (while the poor remain  with one hand in the searing fire).  The war continues working, day and night  it inspires tyrants  to deliver long speeches  awards medals to generals  and themes to poets  it contributes to the industry  of artificial limbs  provides food for flies  adds pages to the history books  achieves equality  between killer and killed  teaches lovers to write letters  accustoms young women to waiting  fills the newspapers  with articles and pictures  builds new houses  for the orphans  invigorates the coffin makers  and gives grave diggers  a pat on the back  paints a smile on the leaders face.  It works with unparalleled diligence! Yet no one gives it a word of praise.  By Dunya Mikhail Translated by Elizabeth Winslow and Saadi A. Simawe

      Yoda is leaving today for Canada after barely two weeks of visit here. He hasn't flown off and I already miss him. I saw him a while ago and I thought we'd be talking (and kissing) for a while but he has errands to do, just like everytime he has to fly. He promised to be back next month. God, I hope so!  On the other side of the world...    urlLink  Iraqis Cheer Collapse of Saddam's Regime         BAGHDAD, Iraq - Their hour of freedom at hand, jubilant Iraqis celebrated the collapse of Saddam Hussein's murderous regime on Wednesday, beheading a toppled statue of their longtime ruler in downtown Baghdad and embracing American troops as liberators.     I hope things will go smoothly after Saddam has been toppled. I'm more keen now on the follow-up stage of "regime change" in Iraq, as the US/UK and probably with the help of the UN install a new government in Iraq. First, they have to create some order as anarchy and lawlessness prawl on the streets, towns and cities of Iraq. Second, the coalition had better come up with a new government that will work for the welfare of Iraq and its peoples. I'm worried that this might be just another "burning bush" where people are most interested only in the earliest stages of reconstructing a country. When the dust has literally and figuratively settled, the issue will be pushed down the bottom of the list of priorities. I hope this will not happen in Iraq. Remember Afghanistan.   urlLink  Hold Your Applause      We are so caught up with our own story of "America's liberation of Iraq," and the Arab TV networks are so caught up with their own story of "America's occupation of Iraq," that everyone seems to have lost sight of the real lives of Iraqis.

        Relax, It's just new age   I'm saving tracks from my new age CD into mp3. I want to listen to the tracks even when I don't have my CD player with me, such as when I'm at the office.  I love the tracks. They're very relaxing.  Sheesh, it's almost midnight and I'm still wasting company resources at the office.  Have to go soon. Real soon.

      Weekends can never be too short. I attended another dismal class last Saturday and turned another dismal performance when problem solving time arrived. I'm really behind by about three chapters (or lessons) from almost everyone (except perhaps those who didn't take up econ in undergrad) so I'm working double-time to keep up. We scheduled our mid-terms for July 23 and thank God, we'll stick to lectures next Saturday.  Doji and I decided to start getting active this year, aside from jogging in a nearby park, we'd get ourselves into badminton. We bought a pair of rackets last Saturday at Toby's and headed off to PICC grounds yesterday morning for a game of badminton at a rented court.  PICC is quite a happening place on weekend mornings. It has loads of people who just want to be active even if just for once a week. You can play badminton, tennis, jog, bike and join the free aerobic classes, from tai chi to tae bo.   I finally saw  The Hulk  last night. It would have been really good if not for the awful CGI. For me, the best scenes are those that do not involve Hulk. The cast turned out a decent performance and the whole story is one roller coaster ride. Lou Ferrigno also had a cameo appearance as a security guard where Bruce works.      urlLink  Check out the new ROTK desktop

      Yay! My blog already has some semblance of drama. I've been formating the template for three days. I like it better. Still not as professional nor as spiffy as the others, but I like it. It's something for a beginner.  So how was my day? As usual, I didn't get much sleep so I'm already very, very tired. The class was disappointing, especially the activity because, again, I couldn't give any hint of answer to Kristine and it has always been her who was doing all the work in solving our assignments. This is really shameful. We will have our mid-terms on July 23. I hope I'll do well in the exams and get a high score, not just passing score. *crosses fingers*

      Romy sent us an alleged soft copy (in RTF) of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix early this week. I say "alleged" because I don't have a way of knowing if it was the real deal since I haven't opened a single copy of the latest HP installment and I am still waiting for the copy that Paddy has sent me.   I tried to check out if it might be a real HP5 by copying and pasting the first line on Google and I got results that matched the teaser paragraphs leaked by the publishers early this year. It does look like the real thing. So while I still have to receive the pre-ordered copy, I'll read the thing I've got.   If this is a true soft copy leak, what's really bothering me is the speed with which the fifth book was pirated. Just three days after the release, a copy of the book in Word format reached my Inbox (and those of others).

      Sucky day, but it was no less my fault. I spent the entire morning in bed and got up only until it was time to prepare for a meeting at ASL. Because of traffic that the cab driver had chosen to wade through, I was late by fucking 30 minutes.   My role in the meeting was to present our web site and how they could use it as a classroom resource.  The teachers made their resource requests, mostly about women issues and...this is a classic: a list of ALL saints. Heaven help me, but I don't even know who they are. I am not Catholic. But it's my job to hunt them down and offer them in a silver plate to our clients.  I passed by National Bookstore to buy some children's activity books and a copy of TIME, which had a one-page review of HP5. My copy of HP still has to reach my mailbox. Tina sent it from Germany through DHL. I don't know, but DHL surely is slow (FedEx takes only 3 days max) or my package got lost. Gawd, I hope it's already there when I get home.  I slept at 2:30 this morning (which should explain why I woke up late) after reading my mathematical economics notes. I'm hanging on a thread in this subject and if I don't pass the mid-terms, I'm dropping the damn subject, give myself time to read up about it and enroll it next term. But I still hope I'd do good in the mid-term exams so I won't have to pay La Salle again for this subject.  So far, so good. I'm getting the hang of dilly-dallying with this blog's template. I'm a novice so this doesn't look professional enough as compared to the others who have spent so much time designing web pages. Ciao.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help me remember how to smile? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How on earth did I get so jaded? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's mistery seems so faded.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Runaway Train  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(music in the cab while frying in the traffic)   PS:  I saw Nancy in front of Pacific star, probably waiting for a jeep. I didn't see her until the cab moved, but I sure as sure she saw me.

       The Prince of Tides          I finally got to finish   urlLink The Prince of Tides   last night. This book had caused me to stay awake in the wee hours of the morning and kept my hands from those other books that I should prioritize reading--i.e., my textbooks. It is engrossing, or I wouldn't bother muself with turning its pages until past witching hour. Pat Conroy weaved words beautifully into one pattern filled with drama, suspense and sometimes, laughter.   The Prince of Tides  centers on Tom Wingo, a South Carolinian, who grows from a dysfunctional family composed of a cruel father and a manipulative mother. The only bright spots in the family are his twin sister, Savannah, and his older brother, Luke.       As the story starts, Tom tells of his gifted sister's suicidal breakdown, Luke's death, his father's imprisonment, his mother's journey from loving mother to top-notch manipulator, and his eventual downfall as a man. He goes to New York upon the request of his mother and Savannah's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, to help unravel Savannah's history because part of her madness is caused by repression and there are a lot of blotches in her past that she cannot recall when she talks to her "team". One of those blotches is what happened on their island, the darkest family secret that only the three children and their mother know and conspired to hide from their father and the rest of the world, except for Lowenstein. Tom does as requested and in the process understands the reasons not only of his sister's breakdown, but also his family's downfall and his personal failures. He also falls in love with Lowenstein and at the same time teaches her how to appreciate herself as a woman instead of forever living in the shadows of her famous husband.  All in all, the books is a story of renewal and self-discovery. My only comment is that the things that led to Luke's death simply went out of hand. Even Luke said so himself before he died, but it still made for heavy read that almost jumped from dramatic to bizaare. But then again, nothing is normal in the Wingo family. By the way, the Prince of Tides is Luke. It is a title accorded to him in a poem eulogy written by Savannah for his funeral.

      Right! So I like the new look of this blog better. I guess I'm getting the hang of editing all the codes. I don't want a fuzzy blog, just a neat little place where I could write down things that I would otherwise not put in the other journal, which my friends can read.  The look isn't something I could be very proud of, but I'm comfortable with it. It reflects more of myself than any of those fancy stuff lying around.  (If you fail to notice. This is a test message.)

       Kiss that girl goodbye   I am definitely offended. It all started with Keng sending me an SMS last night about his summer visit in August. I answered him twice. He also talked to Tina, who mentioned to him that I was going to La Salle, so he said, "Tina told me that you are a 'La Salle-ista." I had seen some bickering coming, so I chose to just let it pass and reply this morning. Besides, I was busy reading.  So this morning, I emailed him about my masters studies (Apllied Economics), which, I said, made me a Lasallian. He replied by calling me something that is not mentioned in decent conversations, much referred to a friend. I asked him what was wrong with what I said. He sad that he didn't know I was Lasallian instead of "lasalista" (the former is the nice kind, the latter is the snobbish, snotty type, which people usually attach to La Salle students) and added,  "So, do you 'make tusok' (something you do with a barbecue stick) fishballs? How about somebody else's balls?"   It was a horrible thing to say. It might have been funny about the first sentence, but the one attached at the end was definitely hitting below the belt. Why did he have to say that? Of course, he was making a joke, but puhleeeez! Have some taste  naman  in the choice of jokes to throw my way. Who cares about anyone else's balls? I've got my own, figuratively, and I don't mind the others'.  I answered that I was offended and I wasn't messing with anyone's balls, whatever those are.  This guy just can't be happy with the accomplishments of his friends, much less myself. I don't know what's really wrong with him. I can't have a decent conversation with him and he acts like the lowest life-form on the planet with his sexual insinuations, as if I was sleeping with every available male on the street. (Fact is, I don't.) He goes to a top US med school and he still doesn't seem to be happy about others (such as myself) trying to turn themselves into something. For the life of me, I don't know why he treats people around him like dirt. He keeps saying he's lonely out there in New York, and yet when we come to the rescue, it's as if he was the one who was doing us a favor by simply acknowledging our existence.  I don't think I'd like to talk to him for a while.   Kiss That Girl   Sheryl Crowe   I woke up this mornin' with my makeup on I've been fakin' it lately, but those days are gone You look at me and wonder why I got to cut these strings and learn to fly  But the girl is only in your mind She's leavin' everything behind She's not the girl that's gonna make it right So you can kiss that girl goodbye  We're so glad you made it in this dead end town Everybody's waiting for you to come down You're gonna wake up from your dream You're gonna find someone who looks like me  But the girl is only in your mind She's leavin' everything behind She's not the girl that's gonna make it right So you can kiss that girl goodbye  You could look forever for someone like me She's just a memory  So you can kiss the girl goodbye Kiss that girl goodbye So you can kiss the girl goodbye So you can kiss that girl goodbye    Update: Finished uploading a header. This blogger is giving me a headache.

       Whoa!   Well, this is really not "Whoa!" - inducing.  Still tryin' to get myself into the mood to open my notes and do all the math exercises. I've got a class tomorrow and I've already embarassed myself by not putting enough effort to prove that I can do math too. Will do it good this time.  Meeting with ASL was cancelled yesterday, but Oliver didn't tell me about it soon. I'm glad I didn't go to the office very early or I'd be there in a stuffy "formal" get up which is a let-down for a Friday.  Thank heavens that the guys have refilled the water dispenser so I could make a cuppa coffee. Almost doze off while doing research about labor.  Some stupid member of the group kept griping about not being able to open .pdf file. Maybe I should kick him out of the group for sometime until he shapes up and makes peace with his computer.  Tomorrow's the release of HP5. Can't wait.  Gotta go. Ciao!

      This is from hitormiss's open diary. She's in my public journal's network and I have the link to her other journal.   This is a list of interesting questions, so I'd much like to answer them here where I could be more honest about my opinions and more open about my life--for as long as none of the people who know me that it's me who's behind these words.   So here goes:   1. If you could have anything delivered to your doorstep each morning, what would it be?    A stash of cash would do just fine. Preferably in US$ or UK L .    2. What is one vacation destination that many people think is just fabulous but which you personally have no desire to visit?   India. Anywhere in India, including the Taj Mahal. Not that I don't like Indians, but I don't get over-excited about their tourist spots, including the famous landmark.    3. If you were five years younger but knew everything at that age what you've actually learned over the last five years, what is one thing you would definitely do differently?   Keep your cool. "Outside looking in" isn't such a bad idea and there's so much to be learned from it.    4. If you could wake up to one smell every morning (besides coffee) what would it be?    Some guy's cologne.    5. Suppose that right now you could be at your favorite vacation spot, reading your favorite book, listening to your favorite CD, and eating your favorite food. What would be your choices for those four categories, and who, if anyone, would be with you?     Vacation spot.  This one is tough, because there are so many places that I'd like to go to, if only I had the money. Let me see...I'd probably choose a cozy cafe somewhere in Paris.   Favorite Book.  Hmmm...something that would go with the ambience of the place of course. I've got a long list of favorite books, but if I have to choose one, I'd like it to match the place where I'm reading the book.  Something either romantic or intellectual or magical would do. Harry Potter 5 for magical, an Umberto Eco or Ayn Rand book for intellectual, and a Jane Austen book for romantic--perhaps  Sense and Sensibility  would do.   CD.   Amelie  soundtrack.   Favorite food.  Can I have a favorite drink instead? OK, maybe a Belgian waffle would do, swimming in peach syrup and topped with grated cheese and cream. That, with a mug of coffee.    6. Which animated character is your all-time favorite?    Bugs Bunny. He's classic. He's funny. He's smart.    7. If you had to write a brief message on a dollar bill that many people would eventually see as the currency circulates, what message would you write?    "Money isn't the root of all evil... really !"    8. If you could own a home on the shore of any body of water in the world, which waterfront would you choose?    a secluded, unpolluted lake. now if only i could find one... (from hitormiss)    9. Suppose you had the opportunity to choose 3 people with whom to eat dinner: a famous sports figure, a movie star and a popular singer. Who would you choose?    Sports Figure-- Tennis players fascinate me. I think I'd go for Tim Henmann. I'd badger him about not yet winning a single Wimbledon title, LOL!  Movie star -- Toss between Billy Boyd or Karl Urban. Not very famous stars, but very talented and funny  individuals.   Singer -- Josh Groban. Not my very favorite, but he has great voice and cute too.    10. What serves as the greatest motivation for you in your daily life?    Damned if i know.  Just the fear of failure, I guess. The fear that I have lived my life and it has stayed as it has always been since the day I was born, which really isn't fabulous.    11. What activity that you have to do every once in a while do you dread the most?    Washing the dishes. Braving the traffic. Doing follow up calls, especially if the other person on the receiving end is a bitch.    12. If you were a multimillionaire, what do you believe you would be doing at this very moment?    I'd be touring Europe, visiting all the historical and artsy places--museums, churches, and the very very European countryside that I see only in postcards and Christmas cards. I'd also visit my friends, Siri and Tina and Danny (yay! Norway, Germany and Belgium) and the Brits at Ringbearer. We'd watch movies and plays and get drunk in pubs. That would be fun.     13. If you could have a cookie jar full of anything you wanted, apart from money or cookies, what would be in it?    Jewelry. Am I getting too materialistic? Ok, give me a humongous cookie jar and I'd fill it up with books, a wi-fi ready laptop, all the CDs and DVDs that I want to buy but can't afford, DVD player, dozens of pairs of shoes, The Body Shop collection of cosmetics and bath items, cases of Vodka Ice, a Louis Vuitton purse, a Rolex watch. All that and the jewelry.    14. When people hear what you do for a living, what is the most typical question or comment they give you regarding your job?    A blank stare. They've no idea what the hell I'm doing. It's project management, but people here have a very traditional view of management. duh!    15. If you could have any round object in the world, what spherical item would you want?   A spherical CD player.     16. If you were left alone for one hour with nothing more than a pen and a notepad, what would you be inclined to draw or write during those 60 minutes?    I'd start writing my very first short story.    17. If you could witness anything at all in super-slow motion, what would you want to see?    Two people falling in love with each other at first sight. *sigh*    18. If someone were looking for you in a bookstore, in what section would they be most likely to find you?    Magazine section. That's the first place I go to.    19. What do you forget to do more often than anything else?    My cellphone. I often forget to bring it. Maybe I unconsciously forget it on purpose so people would have a hard time getting in touch with me.    20. If you could teach everyone in the world one skill, what would it be?    To think. Just think! The world is populated by idiots, really.    21. You've been offered the chance to paint a billboard along a highway with any message you choose, as long as it's no more than 15 words long. What is your message?    Two words:  Carpe diem.

      So far, sucky day. So far, sucky week. And seeing as the week starts with Sunday (at least according to the calendar and/or the Catholic church), my week really started out horribly (see previous entry). Couldn't get out, didn't read, didn't write the fucking draft business letters. Nothing! Nada!  I know the problem is with me. Somehow, something holds me back from doing anything--anything at all! For example, I'm supposed to fix the papers for my loan application, but hell, I haven't even downloaded the damn form. I'm so arrested, so bound by something I don't know what. All I want to do is just lie on my bed and read a book. God, if only it were possible to afford such a lifestyle! But no, I have to get up, shower, go to work and do actual work.  But what do I do at the office? Nothing. Browse the internet, download music. Postpone all the task at hand one minute at a time until I realize that it's the end of the day and it has passed as if it didn't happen at all. Cripes! What's going on with me? Why can't I push myself to do something that's even worth thei polluted air that I breathe. I hate myself. I hate my work. I hate my room. I hate this computer I'm typing this stupid blog on, and I hate my life!  This life sucks! Everything sucks!

      By this time, the news is all over the internet and media. Around 3 a.m. Sunday, a group of "rogue" soldiers occupied a codo-tel (condominium-hotel) in Makati central business district, rigged up bombs around the vicinity and set up gun posts.   The coup rumors have been going on for weeks now, and as early as yesterday, PGMA already knew that there would be a plot to overthrow her government. She ordered a hunt-down on the so-called coup plotters, composed by mostly junior officers.  The commercial district is at a stand-still and only the outskirts of Makati shows signs of normality. (Just had lunch with Kristine and Doji at the neighborhood Jollibee store, hehe!) We woke up really early so we could go to PICC for our weekend badminton redevouz, but we received a text from Lovely that there was a coup going on. We watched the news on TV which showed a few soldiers on the rooftop of  urlLink Oakwood , which unfortunately houses lots of expats, including the Australian ambassador. It's smacked right beside Glorietta shoppping complex, which is my usual weekend haunt. (Was planning to see a movie today, but well...)  Anyway, at 10 a.m., the president went on the air and gave an ultimatum to the "rebels" to surrender on or before 5:00 or there would bloodshed. God, I hope all this will be resolved without a single gunshot nor bomb going off. I wish they would resolve everything peacefully.  The coup plotters, I believe, are fighting a lost cause and they should not have done what they already did so far. But I can't dismiss them entirely as just a bunch of soldiers unhappy with their plight. These are the people who face death everyday in the war against Islamic separatists and terrorists (not necessarily all rolled into one), and they knew that SOMETHING WRONG WAS GOING ON. And they happen to be pawns in a war that doesn't seem to have an end, all in the name of the state which they protect.  I can see the stock market falling to its lowest level since the May 1 riot by Monday (should trading open) and the shame it has brought  again  to this country, especially since it supposedly supports the war against terrorism. Ironically, we can't even annihilate the terrorists in our midst. Shame! Shame!  As of now, I am really crossing my fingers that there would be no bloodshed and that the "rebels" would surrender. I feel sorry for them and for everyone that it had to take a coup plot in order to air the soldier's grievances and uncover the irregularities in the military.   Mama called me this morning, worried that since the coup was in Makati (I live about 1.5 km from Oakwood), I might be in harm's way. Told her not to panic (yet) because everything was still calm.  *sigh*

      Just got in from the salon. Had my hair cut. I don't like it and I hope it grows back soon.   The new M&C trailer is out.    urlLink Click here.   It's opening here on November 19.   The doctors already pulled Maj. Gordon's life support. Really sorry. Like I told Fred, the major still lived a beautiful life in spite of the hardships that he went through in his youth. He is in a much happier and safer place now.

      Friday night. Have to get a haircut and then just stay at the "apartment" and read Umberto Eco and Alpha Chiang. Man, am I getting philosophical and mathematical. I've just got to learn and get my brain back to its normal functioning.  Just spent the better part of the last hour scanning my computer for adware and spyware. Those bugs!   Just received email from Keng. Looks like he's in a communicative mode these days. Told him last night about what I thought about his political leanings, which I should say is bi-polar. One time, he sounds like a republican and sometimes, like a commie, like when he said something about MNCs the other day.  Happy weekend!  Still have to work on Saturday. *sigh*

      Another exam last night. This time, for math econ. Dismal of course. Mindboggling as expected. Thing is, the lectures were purely theoretical and we worked with numbers. The exam, on the other hand, was application but we were asked to solve for parameters. Duh!  Well then, it's over and I've got to get it behind me. I almost don't care anymore if I passed or not, although I still pray that I did. Who wants to fluke on the exam, right?  I was feeling so horrible after the test that I went straight to the movies. I was planning to see "Down With Love" (Zellwegger and the delicious McGregor), but since it was the opening night of "Tomb Raider", I thought it might be more worth it to see this flick. And it was  just  a flick--barely sufferable movie with a plotline that was blown out of proportions and peppered with terrible lines.   Verdict: If you are expecting it to be better than the first one, you're up for disappointment. It's THAT bad! The stunts are not even that good for an action movie. Jolie was clearly depressed during the filming and so made a depressing performance. And that hot Glaswegian guy--she killed him because he wanted to take Pandora's box out of "the cradle of life". Duh! Can anything be cheesier than that stupid sub-title.

      It's a stormy day, and classes have been suspended on all levels. Good. I really don't plan to attend tonight's eco502m class to review for my 501 exams. In that case, I'm not missing anything.  Rains started last night and has only let up once in a while the whole night. It's not only rainy it's also windy outside and I wish I were curling up in my bed instead of being here at the office. Anyhow, I'm about to finish my presentation for Women's Issues, so this should be a productive day.  Can't wait for the exam to be over so I could have more time for my extra-curriculars.

      Time for another friday five...   1. When was the last time you cheated?   What kind of cheating? Exam? Tax? Boyfriend? The last time I cheated in acads was in 1996. I didn't know the answer to a question, so I asked for it, more of copied it, from my seatmate.  As for bfs. Well, not exactly bf, but just a date who turned out to be a total fart, so I wasn't sorry for what I did. I dated him and still saw someone else. I will never  ever  regret doing that.    2. When was the last time you stole?   I don't remember. I don't steal. I shoplifted a pair of fake earrings when I was in high school just for the hang of it.    3. When was the last time you lied?   Can't remember. I'm better known for being "frank" than for being a liar. It's more comfortable to be the former than the latter. Anyway, I almost always get caught.    4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?   I don't remember. Probably never.    5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?   I've no idea if I hurt anyone. With my family, the most I could do is not show up during a family occasion, but that's about it. I wouldn't do anything to hurt them. They've been hurt so many times that I don't want to add anything to the long list of hurts they've gone through.

      It's been a while since I updated. I've been terribly busy in the past four days due to my Stat Econ exam on Friday evening. Anyway, it was dismal performance, considering that I even took the day off from work to brush up on my lessons. It didn't make any difference and I'd be very surprised if I passed the exam.  I was also too dumb to bring a proper calculator, in spite of the fact that we had to compute permutations, combinations and factorials! Can anyone be dumber than that? Anyhow, I didn't happen to be the only one who found the exam mind-boggling. Wondered why almost everyone turned up in black shirt the next day. LOL!   I finally saw T3 last Saturday. It's a nice movie and I didn't notice the hours go by as I was watching the film. I had no plans of seeing it, but Elige sent an SMS that it was good. And the actor who played John Connor even looked like Dom Monaghan--only he has an American accent and his chin is in line with the rest of his face. heheh!   Have to see another flick after another exam on Wednesday--"Down With Love". I don't care if it's good or not, but as long as Ewan looks delicious in it, I'd see it. :-)   I forgot that I had a scheduled staff meeting at 9 this morning, so I was surprised that everyone was waiting when I walked into my boss' office at 11:00. I completely forgot all about it! Shame! Shame! Stupid Paul even said that they had been waiting for me. I didn't know why he said it at first, but I realized that I had a scheduled meeting with them! To think that I was even planning not to show up at all just for this Monday. Crazy!  Raymond took me and Oliver (my new partner in crime) out for lunch after the meeting. We ate at Ten Noodles, which serves all kinds of Asian noodles.   The cab I was riding in on the way back to the office almost got a ticket for dropping Raymond off at a "Loading-only" stop, and the cabbie even had the temerity to tell to my face I was pretty. Not that I didn't like the complement, but you know what it's like when a taxi driver all of a sudden tells complements your looks in this weird manner.

      Doj has been acting weird lately. Weird, in the sense that she's been keeping mostly to herself, not talking--at least not as much as she used to--to everyone, particularly me. She has almost ignored me in the past four days and I don't know why she's being almost indifferent. I know that she keeps quiet when someone says or does something she doesn't like, but hell, I don't know what I did to deserve the silent treatment.   The other girls are teasing her about her "secret" bf. I don't know if there is such or if there's any budding lovelife and I don't care either. If she's got one, then I should be happy for her and I really would be if she would just sort herself out. It makes me so uneasy being around her.

      I should have answered these survey questions last Friday on my easyjournal, but I was too lazy to do so. Moreover, some of my so-called friends knew my EJ address so I didn't want to see what would be a not-so-pretty picture of the "friendship" side of my life.  But since they don't know this web log or that they don't know that it's me who's also keeping this weblog, I might as well answer the questions here. So here goes...    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   The funny thing is that I don't even remember  ever  having a best friend. I've had so many friends in our village, from school, at work, everywhere! But I never thought nor even tried to keep a best friend. One or two would turn out to be very close friends of mine, but none ever became a "best" friend.   I don't rate my friends either. To say that someone is "best" is also to delegate the others to the "good" or "better" or "bad" categories, and I am not that cruel. Sorry.    2. Are you still in touch with this person?   With some very close friends, yes.   There was the closest one who knew about my darkest secrets, but it turned out that we were both having our personal issues then, so as time went by and we moved on our separate ways, we just lost contact until we came to the point when we would just treat each other as a mere acquantance.    3. Do you have a current close friend?   Yes. But still our closeness does not resemble that of "best" friends where you just tell each other stuff about yourselves, your days and interests. Somehow, my friendships here has this tinge of jealousy or competition among everyone. It's really weird. When we get together, I feel as if everyone is just trying to outdo each other--who has a boyfriend, a fabulous job, bigger paycheck.   I've also got friends I only get in touch with on the Internet. Now, these people are really very nice. We've never even met, but it seems like we've known each other for years. We share stuff about ourselves and our daily struggles, as well as our joys and interests on our online diaries.     4. How did you become friends with this person?   From college. The others, on the net through movie sites.    5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   I don't recall. If I've chucked a friend, it's mostly because I didn't want him/her to be my friend anymore. I'd keep in touch with someone I want to keep come hell or high water.

      Honestly!   I submitted a half-finished assignment for my stat/econometrics class. It was really shameful and that was the first (and hopefully, the only) time I submitted an unfinished work! Well, our professor has been really kind to us (bless him!) because he allowed us to delay our mid-term exam by one day and another day to submit the second set of assignments. Beyond today, he wouldn't accept late papers, so it was a matter of getting either a P (*crosses fingers*) or a zero (*knocks on wood*).   I took "escaped" for an hour and a half to rush to La Salle and beat the 5 pm deadline. I really hate myself when I do dismal work. I figured I have to work on calculus (ugh!) and memorize so many definitions. How am I supposed to do that when there are millions of backlog work hanging in front of my head, telling me that if I don't perform my job, I might as well resign or just let the damn company close shop. As of now, I am behind by two presentation materials for our clients, and two database. Niiiice!  Another reason why I was so much time is because I can't study in our cramped room, with three roommates hovering everywhere. It's just too damn hard to concentrate, especially when they are watching TV or video. I have got to find myself a new room where I could be alone for most of the time. I do intend to be at the office for half a day tomorrow and take the day off on Friday to prepare for the evening exams. God help me! I have got to pass that exam.

      I've just finished [speed] reading Harry Potter 5, which caused so much delay in doing my stat assignment.   So it was Sirius who died, eh? My guess was partly correct. Before reading it, I thought it had to be either Dumbledore, Sirius, a Weasley or Snape.   Yay! Harry and Cho broke up! I never liked Cho and I hope that she and Harry would never get together again. And do I smell a Harry-Ginny pairing later on? *crosses fingers*  Even though Ginny will go out with Dean Thomas in the 6th book, there's still a big chance that she'll end up with Harry. Man! Even Ron likes Harry for Ginny. And I agree with him.  Screw Cho Chang!

      I'd like to leave early today by, say, an hour, because I realized that I had a paper to submit tomorrow and I want to work on it tonight instead of not report to work tomorrow to solve problems on probabilities. I had fogotten all about it until Cristy texted me this morning. She still irritates me when she sends me SMS as if I was the class' call agent.   I missed Saturday class because I had a fever and so was almost bed-ridden the whole time. I woke up with a headache and muscle pain so I decided to get some rest instead. I'm glad that by evening, my fever was gone and all I had to do was get more sleep.   Inspite of the fever, I still managed to join the Sunday morning workout at PICC. This time, there were five of us and we did doubles on the badminton court. I also attempted to join the public tae bo demo but it was just too much for me and the really short shorts I was wearing. Shopping for undies and denims in the afternoon, plus the hair care update.   Monday meeting this morning and I was ever so glad that it was productive. We decided on two activities for this term and what would be our respective roles. By lunchtime, I had a fag at Shell Select. I thought that the unusual crowd was due to the fact that it was lunchbreak and people were hanging out at Select. It turned out, a head of the National Police and the top honcho of DILG were having a break (along with a battalion of armed guards and a TV crew) on their way to serve an arrest warrant, probably to a suspected drug pusher. I was "feart" at first because of the number of guards and cops in civilian clothes milling around the store. And then, what if a riot occured or someone attacked the would-be politico, who is obviously thinking of running for a senate seat? There was the idea that these guys could arrest people smoking within the vicinity of a gas station too, right?   Anyway, the drug menace is a more serious crime than burning your lungs with tar, so they just ignored the whole bunch of us. Lina smiled at me when he caught me staring at him. Bah!

      Josie is finally here to give us our salary. I received some cash yesterday and I'm happy that I've got extra money to pay the second (and last) installment of my tuition for this term. I remember that I have to work on my social security ID so I could file a loan for next term's tuition. Otherwise, I'd be forced to apply residency because of money problems, and that's a thought that I'm not very comfortable with. I'd like to finish my masters as soon as possible so I could move on. I don't want to be stuck forever in this joke of a job which although pays good, is still not fulfilling. In the first place, the company could close shop anytime and I hope that at least I'd have a continuous employment until I finish school.   Anyway, it's Friday night and I'd like to just wander around for a bit before I bury my nose in my math notes again. Jill finally sent me notes for topics 6 and 7. I guessed right that she confused topics 8 and 9 with the others becuase she sent those twice to me. I wonder if I should watch Charlie's Angels. I haven't seen it and I believe that it's on its last weekend here because there are interesting movies opening next week.   I'm delayed with the presentation about women's issues. Jeez! That's the evil with procrastination. Next week, I have a commitment for Renaissance art. Then there were the Catholic saints that need to be upped ASAP. God! Help me in this. I don't have all the time in the world and I'm already having trouble managing the little time and resources I've got.  Gotta go.

      Still met him last night. I'm lonely he's flying out today.    Power Of Two  Indigo Girls   Now the parking lot is empty  Everyone's gone someplace  I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed  A cooler and a two day suitcase  'Cause there's a place we like to drive  Way out in the country  Five miles out of the city limit we're singin'  And your hand's upon my leg   So we're ok, we're fine  Baby I'm here to stop your crying  Chase all the ghosts from your head  I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  Look at them together then we'll take them apart  Adding up the total of a love that's true  Multiply life by the power of two   I know the things that I am afraid of  I'm not afraid to tell  And if we ever leave a legacy  It's that we loved each other well   'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  Trying on the treasures of youth  But a road that fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash  And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth   So we're ok, we're fine  Baby I'm here to stop your crying  Chase all the ghosts from your head  I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  Look at them together then we'll take them apart  Adding up the total of a love that's true  Multiply life by the power of two   All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  Something new instead of something old  But all you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  And it's fool's gold  Fool's gold   Now we're talking about a difficult thing  Your eyes are getting wet  I took us for better and I took us for worse  And don't you ever forget it   Now there's steel bars between me and a promise  Suddenly bend with ease  And the closer I'm bound in love to you  The closer I am to free   So we're ok, we're fine  Baby I'm here to stop your crying  Chase all the ghosts from your head  I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  Look at them together then we'll take them apart  Adding up the total of a love that's true  Multiply life by the power of two

      Just texted Norbert. I was hoping I'd be with him later, but apparently he had to meet some buddies somewhere and wasn't sure when the meeting would be over. I said maybe we could be together tomorrow. He said he was leaving tomorrow for Canada.   I am terribly disappointed. I was hoping that he would be here longer, or at least a week. If I had known, I would have joined him more often. But there was the stupid assignment, meetings and my nocturnal habits to deal with, so we couldn't be together as often as we wanted to.   I already miss him. I get depressed whenever he has to leave.  Thank God, I'm getting my pay tomorrow. I could go out and have a round of badminton with Doj or go out and see a movie.

      I bought a Savage Garden CD at the University Mall after class.   Currently listening to  urlLink  I knew I Loved You  .   It's Saturday afternoon and yet I'm here at the office doing OT(Y) work. June and July are my busiest months and there doesn't seem to be any let up soon now that I have added school into my frayed schedule. If I were not going to school and didn't have to review everynight, I would have stayed overnight at the office. I did that for countless times last year, but this year, it's different. Which also should explain the lack of updates lately.   Kristine is back from Batangas, so there'll be three of us tomorrow at the badminton workout at PICC. Yay! I'm really excited!

      I've just talked to Danny. Told him I was doing my blog. He asked me if he could read it, but I refused and told him it was "top secret". I intend to make it not known among those who know me. I have another journal that some friends can read. This one is for myself and those who've no idea who I am.  I'm really very hungry. I should be at the Met Museum's launching of an urban development exhibit. I should be munching on their tasty food and drowning in white wine right now. sigh!  Kodi texted me last night, asking what I wanted to be five years from now. I said I hope we were still together and perhaps I'd be a mom to his child. I'm not sure if the second one has any chance of happening. We can work on the first one, though. I can't see anything of / for myself in terms of relationships five years from now. It just is not in the top of my "to do" list even though I'd like to have a meaningful relationship most of the time.

      I'm leaving early for class. I forgot to bring my registration form so I have to pick it up from the dorm, otherwise, the guards wouldn't let me in. My ID will still be available this weekend so that means I will have to lug around my reg. form until then.  I visited EQ office this morning to meet with Tata's staff. It wasn't really productive at all, and I'm already starting not to like visiting her office because I don't only spend a lot on taxi fare, I also waste so much time waiting for anyone to be available to meet with me. And come meeting time, we just talk about the same things that we have talked about in previous meetings. Tata wants me to be there every Monday even though there is no clear agenda for my presence in her office, other than update everyone, which I can do effectively via e-mail.  Talk about wasting resources, time and energy!  I have to face horrible Taft Avenue again. *sigh!*

       Survey from  urlLink Fridayfive.org     1. Are you going to school this year?  Yes. I'm taking up my masters. It isn't easy, but I have to.   2. If yes, where are you going (high school, college, etc.)? If no, when did you graduate?  Currently enrolled at the De La Salle University College of Business and Economics. I took my undergraduate at University of the Philippines - Diliman.   3. What are/were your favorite school subjects?  Nothing. Wherever I'm good at is my favorite subject. But seeing as I'm struggling through my subjects, you can say that I and acads don't get along so well. Maybe I'll have luck next term.   4. What are/were your least favorite school subjects?  Anything that has to do with numbers.   5. Have you ever had a favorite teacher? Why was he/she a favorite?   A few. I can recall only those in undergrad since I'm still not familiar with my gradschool profs. I remember having enjoyed classes with Dr. Paz Diaz, Tessa Jazmines, Atty. Arcilla and Georgina Encanto (at least for the second time she was my professor, when she gave me really high marks at the end of the term).    -------------------------------    Memory   Each day is a step closer  To forever of  Not having you beside me.  As I greet the morning sun  That dawns on your memory,  I have no choice but to  Bid farewell to the moment  Wrapped by your warmth  And realize that as memory fades,  The distance between us stretches  To only a faint vision of what had been.  Maybe one day  When we have completed the circle,  Our paths would meet again  And we would recall that  Once  We were one.    (JRET, I miss you!)

      Math concentration dramatically improved. Yay!  Period finally arrived. Yay! Even though I don't want to be a mom yet, sometimes I ask if I really have the capacity to bear a child. I mean, what if there was something wrong in my body that would make me incapable of getting pregnant?  I'm like a sicko lurking in search engines to try to find a glimpse of K's life out there. I tried to search for his name before, but found nothing because I used the wrong search expression. The guy has three first names, for Pete's sake! But anyway, I went to his school's web site and tried to look for his email (not that I didn't know it) and got positive result. I then used the name he listed on the search engine and found about 5 entries under his name, including a letter to the Inquirer. I remember he mentioned having had his letter to the editor published on the paper.  Gawd, I miss him! But I guess I have lick my wound and rebuild my pride. I don't want to run after a guy who doesn't even think about me. There's always something to be learned from Hermione.

      I'm on leave today to review for my finals on Saturday. I wasted the last two days by reading non-important (yet interesting) stuff instead of my math econ book, so now I have to cram and hope against hope to retain at least most of what I have read.  I've been having a hard time concentrating on important, make-or-break matters. It's like trying to hold water in my hand. Reasons are mostly emotional and not intellectual. I'm not stupid where academics is concerned. But it's really hardest when it's your heart that gets in the way of learning.  Funny, for a so-called smart girl, my head still has to win over my heart.

      I have just returned from Makati Med to get the results of my pap smear exam last Saturday. My OBG decided to have me go through paps so I guess we'll have to see each other every year. Only every year for my test, I hope. anyway, the result was normal: "Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy." It was my first, so I was a bit excited.  I have finally received the HP5 book which Tina I. sent me in June. I should have received it then, but the post took months to handle the package--both on Germany's and our end. I'm glad that it was not pilfered by our customs and post crooks. When I retrieved the package at the post office, the customs officer opened the box in front of me. For what reason, I wasn't sure, but maybe to see if there was anything that shouldn't be there. Negative result, of course, as only the book could be found.  The fact that it was the UK edition made the wait somehow worthwhile because no store sells UK eds of the book here. The local distributors are a bit tied to Scholastica, eh?  I still miss him. Sometimes, when I think about what happened, I can't help but be hurt and confused. Did he at least like me or not? Was he planning everything all along even before last Friday? If he at least had enough liking for me both as a friend and as a person, I would appreciate it and wouldn't be hurt so much. The thing is, I don't know how I stood in his regard. I'm not expecting him to feel the same way as I do, but a little respect would do just fine.  God, I hope the period would be in right soon.

      I miss him. I've been trying to review for tomorrow's exams, but thoughts of him keep finding their way inside my head. It doesn't hurt as much as it had yesterday, the feelings are still there and I can only take small steps in taking myself out of the blues. I not only feel trapped, but also hopeless. But somehow, the things that I need to accomplish this week keep me from having so much sad thoughts. Music is definitely mood upper because oftentimes, you just need to borrow words and emotions from others to express how you feel. That's what music does and often, I listen to my very favorite band, The Corrs. Kristine said that I like them because I could relate to their songs. Yes, of course!  Keng texted me (probably along with all our friends) this morning that he had already touched down at New York airport. I'm glad he got there safely.  I'm still waiting for the period to come. It really scares me now that we had unprotected sex when I'm supposed to be "unsafe".  I went to an OB-gyn yesterday and she gave me a "morning-after" pill to, of course, prevent something untowards from happening. I also took the chance to go through a pap smear. I should have done it a long time ago, but I was very careless with my repro health. Just please, God, don't make me reproduce yet.  Yesterday, I was so much itching to tell what happened to Tina. Now I'm having second thoughts and because Keng also asked me to. It's going to be another DDS, then, isn't it? Certain truths have a way of being uncovered, but I'll try to hide it as much as I can. I hope it won't be discovered or that there would be no need to have it uncovered.  God, if only Keng knew! Sometimes, he has love staring him squarely in the face and not realize it. I love him.

      This and yesterday are such bittersweet days. Keng is flying out of the country and I have no idea when I would be with him again.  He's still boarding the plane as I am writing this, but I miss him already. Terribly.   A part of my heart is like a dormant volcano that suddenly woke up from deep slumber and I found myself aching for this one man whom I have cared for deeply since the day we became friends.  I only realized that I loved him when I was already on the bus back to Manila from Angeles last night.    I texted him the other night to greet him goodnight and to remind him that there were only two nights' sleep to go before his flight back to New York. He answered early in the morning that he didn't sleep anymore (so he wouldn't count how many sleeps were left before leaving). I answered back when I woke up around noon and we talked some stuff about my review and he said that if he had the time he would coach me. I answered that I wish there was time and that he was near so I could consult him. There were double-meanings in the exchange which was something we have always been used to and thought it was funny. And then he asked if I could go to Angeles and meet him. I said yes, but still asked him if he was serious. He was. I asked if I could bring Tina. It took him a couple of minutes to answer so I took that time to ask Tina if she was available for a two-hour trip to Angeles and meet JRET. Then, JRET asked me if I should  really  bring her along. I said that if Tina was available, then I would bring her. But if she wasn't, then I would meet him by myself. I didn't know that he already had something in mind when I asked about Tina. Apparently he wanted me to be there alone and leave the third member of the group.  So while I was taking the shower, Tina called me up and told me that Keng sent her the same "no sleep counting" message and she got worried and thought he was depressed--something which is quite typical for someone who's moving.  She also wondered why there was a sudden decision to go there. I said it was really impromptu.  By 2:30 pm, I boarded a north-bound Victory Liner that would drop me off at Dau bus station in Pampanga. The trip stretched to 2 hours and a half because of heavy traffic caused by road constructions along the North Expressway and the rain which suddenly fell just as we were driving out of Manila. JRET picked me up at 5:10 at the bus station. He was driving his brother's Mitsubishi Adventure. Nice.  We didn't have any plan for the rendevous, so we just kept asking each other what we were supposed to do. To buy time, we ate at this karaoke place first, but the deaf-tone karaoke singers were just too much to bear so we left the place after finishing our sizzling seafood and drinks. We drove towards another town which Keng was unfamiliar with and on the road spotted this drive-in motel. He joked that maybe we should go there instead. I joked ok, but told him to just drive on. By then I wasn't thinking anything could happen although in my head the possibility was always there as there was just the two of us and well, the physical attraction was there too. You just have to know it when it has a chance of ever happening.  As we drove on, there was nothing much on the road that could attract our attention and I could not suggest anything to do, so I asked him to be the lead instead. He asked me dozens of times if I was sure I wanted him to decide for us. I had an idea of what he had in mind--drive in--but I was still laughing at the idea and didn't take it seriously as we were driving back. And then we reached the place and drove in. And then we got a room. And then we were inside the room. I was already a bit scared, a bit excited, a bit in wonder and a bit weirded out. I tried to distract him by turning on the TV and suggesting that we watch something (which was of course stupid, I know!). He said, "Don't tell me that you would open your books on me" because I really brought my stat book to read on my way to Angeles. I said, "Yes I would". He just laughed. I sat on the bed and he followed suit. Then he pulled me to him and kissed me. That was it and that was when the whole situation started to sink in. We had sex. It was beautiful and we both liked it. I had sex with my best male friend whom I have had a crush on since the day I met him seven years ago. God, I couldn't believe we did that but it happened.  We were there for nearly three hours and I wish we could stay much longer, but we had to leave because I had to be back in Manila while he had to make an appearance to his friends and do some packing. We had shower together, standing totally naked to each other and still talking about so many things about each other's lives--career, people, studies, plans in life--things that matter to us a lot. Afterwards, he drove me around Angeles town and then we had dinner at a Vietnamese restaurant. It was great that there were no awkward moments inside the car. We still talked about the country and the things that make it different--positively or negatively--from others, the things about our youth, our friendship since college. He mentioned that one of our friends had been asking questions about us, but I didn't ask him what he told her because probably he said the same thing when I asked him about Les, and I didn't want to hear it. I told him that yes, Cienna and others believe that I had a crush on him and that yes again, I had way back in college. That was a half-lie, of course. And yeah, he brought up that it was really possible for people to think that we were dating each other because we had been friends for so long and we always watched movies together. But in all reality, it was very platonic and neither any one of us could even think there could be anything that would go on. And anyway, we had our own relationships with other people in college--me, when I was about to graduate and him, when he was already teaching at UP. I believe no one was sorry for what happened and as he told me, "You're still my friend." I am and I will always be.  By 10:45 pm, we were already at the bus station to catch my ride back to Manila.  He looked for a bus that could pick up an additional passenger and found a Victory Liner which luckily had enough free seats. I thought, even that thing with looking for a bus and a seat for me was very sweet. I doubt it if Norbert would do that for me. When I was already seated, he kissed me goodbye (on the lips,  siempre !) and got off the bus before it rolled out of the station.  Once he left, it hit me really hard: I loved him and had been loving him all this time. As I said, that part of my heart was like a dormant volcano which suddenly exploded and I caught unaware. In spite of this certain entry when I got pissed off with him, I had a small corner in my heart which only he could reach and only he was allowed to go in. Last night, it allowed him in without even me knowing it, much less him. He unknowingly found the way to my heart. I'd like to find my way to his. I love him. He thought I simply shared my body with him, but what he didn't know was that I offered my heart. God, if he only knew!  I couldn't bear the thought and my emotions just welled up. I was crying from the bus station all the way to the expressway, and it was just made worse by all those stupid love songs on the radio which made it seem as if the songs were chosen as a soundtrack for my misery. The misery of realizing I had loved him all this time, the misery of the fact that he was leaving and the misery of not knowing when he would be back. I hope sooner than his two-year prediction. Again, God, if he only knew! God, make him realize it. God, make him realize it and respond to me positively...without a baby. Yet.  When we were together, I was so near to telling him that loved him him, but I was scared that those words might scare him away and make me lose my dear, dear him. I hope it wasn't just casual sex to him as it was not for me. When we were together on Monday last week, I was hoping that he would kiss me but he did not. What did I know, we were friends!    Funny, isn't it? It was like in the movies. It's been told time and again from both end of the gender spectrum. Boy and girl become friends, one of them doesn't know about the other's feelings while the other is dying to give any hint of what one feels. It's crazy. And I'm in the middle of that craziness, which I hope would not get worse (*crosses fingers*) because we had unprotected sex and I was unsafe. I hope the cramps I'm feeling right now are signs of my impending period (*crosses fingers again*).  He called me up an hour ago, as he had promised last night when I called him to say that I had reached the dorm.  He texted me (along with everyone) on his way to the airport and I thought he wouldn't call me anymore. But I still carried with me my cellphone, just in case. My cell rang around 11:25 when he called me before boarding the plane. We talked for a few minutes and confirmed his suggestion when he asked me yesterday about what I would do first thing in the morning: wonder if it really happened. I asked him to always keep in touch (because I would). We made the "bastusan" talk again and laughed about it. We mentioned last night's event and it was good. No over-analyzing between the two of us, although I've been thinking about it from before it even began and up to now. When he said, "until we meet again," I teased him that I would see him there. God, if it were so easy to get a visa to the states and I had more money, I would be on the next plane out of here. God, I love him and I wish he would realize it and love me back! I hope he does and will love me to as I love him. I pray that he is not another cruel joke because he felt so right and I felt like I belonged to him and I could be his forever. If he only knew! Maybe if I pray for everyday of my life for it, it would happen.  As for the songs, even when I rode in a jeep on the way to have breakfast at McDo, "Don't Say You Love Me" was on the radio. Now, there is a soundtrack for all of this and I have a "Songs for Keng" MP3 playlist:  You Should Know By Now (Angela Bofill) Buses and Trains (Bachelor Girl) Somewhere Down the Road (Barry Manilow) -- totally tearjerker! Sway (My Way) (Bic Runga) If You Ask Me To (Celine Dion) -- If he does, I will say "Yes!" First Kiss ("Ever After" OST) -- first kiss last night too  Insensitive (Jann Arden) -- he is! Girlfriend (Julia Fordham) -- ditch the girlfriend you never really loved in the first place Friend of Mine (Lea Salonga) -- always my song for him I Have Dreamed ("King and I" OST) -- I have Always You ("My Best Friends Wedding" OST) -- though I hope to marry him myself I'll Be Okay (do) Champagne Supernova -- no aparent reason other than he said he sang it in last karaoke session with his buds Paalam Na/Goodbye (Rachel Alejandro) -- playing as we arrived at the bus station. Imagine! People Alone (Randy Crawford) --  "Take me along...I don't have to know exactly where you are going..."  Something Stupid (Nicole and Robbie) --  "And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like, 'I love you...'"  I Knew I Loved You (Savage Garden) --  "And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend."  What Do We Mean To Each Other? (Sergio Mendes) -- What is it, really? It Might Be You (Stephen Bishop) -- It might be him after all Passenger Seat (Stephen Speaks) -- I was on the passenger seat. Don't Say You Love Me (The Corrs) -- Say it, but mean it. Love Gives, Love Takes (The Corrs) -- Such bittersweetness! Runaway (The Corrs) -- Oh so last night! I'm Still Here (Vertical Horizon) Sunrays and Saturdays (Vertical Horizon)  We Could Be In Love (Lea Salonga and Brad Kane) -- We could be! *crosses fingers* Show Me The Way To Your Heart (Sara Evans) Whenever I Call You Friend (Michael Johnson) -- we were singing this in his car     WHENEVER I CALL YOU FRIEND   Michael Johnson  Whenever I call you friend  I begin to think I understand  Anything we are  You and I have always been ever and ever   I see myself within your eyes  And that's all I need to show me why  Everything I do, always takes me home to you  Ever and ever   Now I know my life has given me  More than memories  Day by day we can see  In every moment there's a reason to carry on   Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light  I've never seen such a beautiful sight  Sweet love flowin' almost every night  I know forever we'll be doin' it...right   Whenever I call you friend  I believe I've come to understand  Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be  Forever and ever   I think about the times to come  Knowin' I will be the lucky one  Ever our love will last  I always want to call you friend   Sweet love...sweet love  You're the glowing light in my life  The source of pride in my life  Everything I do takes me back to you

         "Cause everything you wanted me to hide  Is everything that makes me feel alive."    --Vertical Horizon, "I'm Still Here"    The last few weeks have been a roller coaster ride for me. As I have mentioned before (in this or other journal), I've been looking for a new job. I've sent a few applications, but sadly, I still haven't heard of any feedback to my applications and it's starting to make me think of myself as unemployable in spite of the fact that I graduated from the supposed top university in the country. Clearly, being a UP graduate is not enough anymore and now I wonder what would have happened if I listened to my parents instead and took up Accounting at CLSU. I might have been in the corporate field today, which is really what I've wanted ever since I stepped out of school and into the real world.  I flunk both mid-term exams horribly, but I don't mind anymore. I'm trying to get into another program by shifting. The other, perhaps I have to start from scratch but it would be worth my meanest try. *Crosses fingers and hopes God doesn't step in and stop me from getting into the "better" program*  Yeah, I've been really getting mean about my faith in God and it has hit an all-time low, but I still wish from the bottom of my heart that he will allow and help me achieve my dreams. I want to do good in life not for my own sake but also for the sake of my family and the one that I am going to build. Selfish as I am, I know that I don't live in an island alone, but that I am but a speck in the general dusty atmosphere called humanity and I have to do my share.  Anyway, last week has been quite a happy and exciting one which was a good break from my nearly hermetical existence when I shut out everyone from me--most especially my roommates--and did some thinking about what I'd like to happen and came to these conclusions: (1) get a new job and start a new career; (2) Give best in school even if it means flunking both subject and don't let it matter but just let things be and learn whatever I can from the experience; (3) get into another graduate program.  Now that I have announced it on this "secret" journal, it looks like fate will again have to work against me. But I don't care anymore. I just have to go with the flow with these conclusions in mind. Fate (should it exist) always goes against me no matter what I do so I just have to keep moving and maybe meet it head on. In the first place, if you think that things are bad enough, they can still get worse but you can still get through it wounded but barely alive, right?  Keng's arrival was a good reprieve and I spent some time with two of my closest buds--Tina R (who I thought had forgotten about me) and Keng (who I thought just wanted to throw shit at people and nothing else). The Monday night with Keng spent talking while getting drunk was wonderful. It turned out that even if I still wanted to change places with him, I wasn't the only one who was leading a life full of insecurity and crap. We, all of us, have to face our daily demons and veer from the crap that life throws at us. Life is never fair and we have to get used to it, as what Harvard drop-out Bill Gates allegedly said. It's a sad realization, but it's true and refreshing nonetheless. At least, if you get wounded in the battle, you don't have to come out of it cursing the gods and crying foul when in fact the war is never just and everybody is thrown into it withe highest probability of getting shot and/or shot at.  I still hope that things will get better. I received a good news from Purpletrain and I hope the scholarship is 100% or I won't take it at all.  Cheers. Life sucks.   ---------------------------------------------------------------  A song for Keng:     Sunrays And Saturdays  Vertical Horizon "Running On Ice" Album    Open the window Let the sunset in If only for the last time Let me see you smile again  I'll take my records You can have your books I'm sorry I never read them But it says so much about us  Always trying To make love out of care The perfect recipe But something wasn't there   Chorus:   And I wish you Sunrays and Saturdays Perfect starry nights Sweet dreams and moonbeams And a love that's warm and bright Sunrays and Saturdays Friendship strong and true Oceans of blue and a room wit ha view To live the life you choose   You'll write me letters I'll call you on the on the phone A wire away from touching And never quite alone  We'll get to know ourselves again And we'll heal our hearts It's not that we're bad together We're just better off apart  Always trying To have one and one make two And even though it never worked I still feel love for you

      I had so much fun last Monday night.   Keng was in town last Monday since he was taking a three-week vacation in the country. He's been here since last week but he only got to visit us yesterday when the weather became more favorable for commuting. He texted me in the morning to schedule a "date" which was really jst a dinner with me and Tina. Anyway, Tina was to meet us at 7:00, but I told him that I was free by 5 or 5:30, so he said it was good so we could be together first.   I was at our meeting place by 5:45 but I realized that I was early by an hour and a half. Keng got caught up in his meeting at UP, while Tina was stuck in traffic. We were finally able to have dinner at 8:30 and had a long wacky chit-chat. We are all crazy when the three of us are together and we talk practically anything and everything under the sun (or as in last night's case, under the moon). We hung out at  urlLink Greenbelt 3  café-cum-park area for about 2 hours after dinner. Sadly, Tina lived a bit far from Makati so she had to be fetched by her bf at 11. I stayed with Keng, as it was our initial plan that if Tina wouldn't be picked up by her boyfriend, we would bring her to her house and go out to have a few drinks afterwards.   Since it was almost midnight, the bars were already closing, so we decided instead to have coffee at Starbucks, then buy drinks and finish those at the  urlLink nearby park . We downed two bottles of this vodka concoction and a small bottle of wine. We talked for hours about life, school, work. Mostly, my contributions in the conversation were my current gripes against my work and my life's apparent lack of direction, while he told me things about school. (He received a huge grant for MD/PhD at Einstein Med School in New York and will be there for 7 more years.) We left GB at 2:30.   It was really nice to be with him and just talk with him. There was no malice or any romantic insinuations between us (just that he texted me--and I assumed he was just teasing me--that he wanted to be "solo" with me) I just said, ok and we can just get drunk. We're really buddies, the three of us, including Tina.   I hope the plan for weekend pushes through.  Tina confirmed the Pampanga trip this weekend, so I'm crossing my fingers that it would push through. This would be my last break before my finals week.  I remember, I should get in touch with the Registrar to inquire my shifting to another course. Wish me luck!

        Just a bit of a weekend update, when I feel like I have some semblance of having a life. Second Saturday that I didn't have a class because the prof was out of the country, so I had more time to bum about, read and fix whatever needed fixing. That still didn't mean I shouldn't bury my nose in my books, though. I just didn't bury it as deep as I used to. heheh!  Joy, my sister, cancelled her Saturday visit, so I had time (and money) extra to buy some stuff for myself--calculator, pair of shoes. Hmmm...nice! Seeing as we don't have neither  dress code nor uniform at the office, I have to update my clothes every now and then--or at least when there is a sale at  the mall. Man, I am a victim of consumerism. That's because there's nothing much else to do than shop--window shop, most of the time--so I might as well head off to the only place where I could spend some time away from my troubles.  No badminton over the weekend with friends. Lately, even I have almost forgotten that I existed. That bad, but I don't care. How come the friendship part of my life suddenly took a nosedive?  You know how crappy it is when all your friends suddenly decided to drop you like a hot potato and you don't know why and you just want to cry "Sod the whole lot of them!"   Somehow, I felt like I was being isolated. Doji and Kristine treat as if I wasn't even there. Granted that they speak a different language which I hardly understand. Bug Pete's sake, it's very rude what they are doing. I invited Doji last Friday if she wanted to go to a bar and dance since she brought it up that she wanted to go to a "disco". She said not this weekend, but it turned out, come Saturday evening, all of them went to the bar without even inviting me. I shouldn't mind that I didn't have to be included in that gimmick, but when they arrived, they even played these recording of their conversation at the bar in my presence, thank you very much.  Oh, and then this other fabulous friend of mine, Tina (R), just did the same thing too. First, we set up a night-out and then cancelled at the very last minute and explained that traffic was bad where she was coming from, which was, again, pure BS. First, it was Saturday night. Second, the south highway had this multimillion-bucks-worth thing called "skyway" which is a terribly long bridge which a bus could take to avoid the traffic (even if at a Saturday night there was no need to).   Whatever! I'll just take my sweet time.   NBS and Powerbooks had their quarterly booksale, so I went to my favorite PB branch. It was packed when I went there yesterday. I grabbed a copy of Katharine Graham's   urlLink Personal History   at 50% off. Yay! Had been wanting to get a copy of that book. Thank God, the price was slashed by half. Graham was a remarkable woman who rose from emotional isolation, insecurity and the tragic loss of her husband to suicide. She was at the helm of Washington Post when the Watergate scandal broke out, which eventually led to Richard Nixon's resignation.  I also got a copy of an inspiring book, titled "The Beginnings" which is a retelling of events in the Old Testament in prose format. It's not corny nor too sentimental and more importantly, it has none of that hallelujah-do-this-and-that-or-you-will-go-to-hell bs. It's a collection of beautiful prose, period.  I passed by this morning at the post office to send Tina's Newsweek copy. It should be there in seven working days *crosses fingers*.  Boss wasn't at her office when I arrived at EQ, but I still spent the morning there to draft the letters that she had asked me to write weeks ago.    -------------------------------------------------------- PS: I started writing my first short story. I've been wanting to write one(s), but couldn't muster the guts to. It was lame, but the writing process was fun, and that was the best part of it. So far. --------------------------------------------------------    You've seen the ashes in my heart  You smile the widest when I cry inside and my insides blow apart  I try to wear another face  Just to make you proud  Just to make you put me in my place   But everything you wanted from me  Is everything that I could never be   The cities grow the rivers flow  Where you are I'll never know  But I'm still here  If you were right and I was wrong  Why are you the one who's gone   And I'm still here

How long does it take to get ready for your day?  30 to 45 minutes.    5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?  Only at the nearby McDonalds which serves Pinoy breakfast and bottomless brewed coffee. If I had the money, I'd have breakfast everyday at either Country Waffles or Pancake House.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Was in the mood to download MP3s of local sounds--Sharon, Regine, Rachel, Martin, and co. Funny, listening to midnight radio while studying has got me into the mood for classic local ballads. I've always thought that those pieces should be listened to be "Flips" of all ages. These pieces make up the stuff that goof OPMs are made of. Good musicality, great lyrics, eventhough the oldies' performances need some room for improvement. They have improved over the years.  It's really hard to tolerate, the crap that current acts are dishing out these days. Obviously, they've ran out of creative juices because for them to be able to come up with a decent album that would sell, they'd have to do "revivals" of old, tried-and-tested songs that were popular in the past years. Whereas songs from 15 to 20 years ago were crafted in style and imbued with poetry that it would just make you want to be proud that you speak the Tagalog language, which, really, is a language better used for aesthetic expression.  Have so far downloaded the following:  Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas Bituing Walang Ningning Pangako Pangarap na Bituin Dapat Ka Bang Mahalin Sana'y Maghintay ang Walang Hanggan Dito Ba? To Love Again Bakit Ikaw Pa Rin? Kahit Na Ikaw Lamang  Well, what else can I say? It's a sign that I spent my childhood in the 80s and adolescence/teenage years in the 90s. I'm turning 26 in less than two weeks.

      It has been a week and the country's nose is still stuck in the  urlLink Kris-Joey rift . Isn't it time to say, "Enough already!" The latest update, as of this morning paper's front page, Ms. Aquino had filed charges against Marquez yesterday. I forgot the exact list of charges, but physical abuse and grave threat were there.   What is annoying about the whole sordid affair is not the sordid affair itself. It has been publicized before and even at its very beginning had shocked the already dumbed-down population of "star struck ignoramuses." What is amazingly shocking about it is the way the country had kept itself glued to the messy lives of the major characters in the real-life-to-reel-life novela. It overshadowed the biggest news last week, which involved an attention-seeking, mud-slinging hoodlum in the senate and another weakest link in the the current administration: the president's husband. The Kris-Joey affair overshadowed the president's plunging popularity rate, pushed the dramatic slide of the currency against the greenback further into the shadows oblivion (so don't be surprised if prices of commodities shoot up again), and made the country shrug its shoulders over security threats and political wringing between parties. Don't they know that Cojuanco and Poe are thinking of joining arms against Arroyo should she decide to run? Where everything and anything can happen, things like the kris-Joey affair just don't fail to amaze everyone.  What I really hate about the whole issue is not that it simply involves allegations of physical and psychological abuse, nor that it has big names, money and politics thrown into the mix. What drives my blood to boiling point is the fact that in spite of the popularity of the persons involved, the issue has not elevated to something that would have somehow become relevant to the lives of ordinary people. Think about this: not all women has a former president for a mother. Not all women have families they can run to. Not all women have TV networks waiting unravel their sordid tales  before the eyes of the drama-hungry masa. Not all women have as much money as Ms. Aquino. Not all women have connections that Kris can pull in to crush anybody who dares to threaten her.   While it is true that nobody--and I mean nobody--deserves to be abused, people should not get too stuck on the Kris-Joey affair as if it were the biggest case of domestic violence history has ever seen. Kris, battered mistress as she has been, is still luckier than others who have no one and nowhere to run to. And that is where the issue should be streered, not just on the big names and money involved. It only makes the word CHEAP stamped all over the tale, much less on the people in the story.   How come there was not much indignation--especially the church and among feminist groups--when  urlLink Maria Theresa Carlson  jumped to her death because she could not take anymore of her husband's beatings and harassment? She suffered for 13 long years in the hands of her husband. Why not ask, "If these prominent people can go through such horrible experiences, then what is it like for ordinary women who live and sometimes die at the mercy of their crazed husbands, fathers and boyfriends?"   What would make this issue relevant is if concrete steps are taken to ensure the safety of women at home, at work and in their communities; when they can equip themselves with laws and societal support against anyone who mean to harm them. Until that happens, the country had better turn its attention to more important issues.

      Upon the plodding of my roommates, I forced myself to watch "Kung Ako Na Lang Sana" yesterday. It stars Sharon and Aga. Yikes, after a very very very long time, I watched a local movie. I hate watching local movies as they're usually a worthless, mindless mess of jumbled lines, bad acting and directorial wrecks. In short, our local flicks suck.   So did this film, if not for the fact that Aga was in it and he was as cute as ever. He is one of those very few gifted actors who act without effort and almost unconsciuosly give life to otherwise lifeless character. Anyway, the film is about two best friends--girl and boy. Girl is a go-getting achiever and makes so much money over the years but eventually finds herself alone--a spinster--as all of her female friends get married and have kids of their own. Guy, on the other hand is a womaniser who doesn't have a direction in life other than that which leads to between a woman's legs. In spite of their differences, they still remain friends and run into each other whenever one of them gets lonely, gets dumped, or simply doesn't have anything to do. Eventually, they realize that they like each other.  My roommates told me to watch it because I would definitely relate to the story. In a way, I did. My "friend" talks almost exactly they way "Enteng" does.  But that's where the similarities end. I'm not as go-getter as Sha's character and I don't have as much money as she has. My friend stands on a more solid foundation is quite far from being a skirt-chaser, as far as I know.   All in all, the film is ok, but it doesn't mean that it does not have room for improvement. In fact, it has more room for improvement than it has for what had already been improved. I don't know what it is with these filmmakers, that they can't come up with an intelligent, glitch-less piece. I don't know what it is either with local moviegoers that they keep getting suckered into watching these mind-numbing flicks.

      Since I couldn't meet Kodi last night, I decided instead to buy my gift for Liza's son who's having his first birthday tomorrow.  I bought a pair of blue sandals that makes this funny sound whenever the sole is pressed. So when the baby starts to walk, the sandals will make this very funny sound. Heh...I think I had a pair like that when I was a baby. I could remember that far! LOL!  It was really fun to shop at the children's section. There are all these kinds of very cute things that would be fun to give to kids and babies. I almost wanted to have my own baby so that I could shop there too and shower my babe with those cute gifts and stuff. I guess I was in the mood again to buy last night, so I bought myself a perfume too. It smells exactly like Giorgio Beverly Hills which is my favorite perfume (along with Clinique Happy).  Kodi leaves today for Canada. He told me he'd be leaving tomorrow, but I wonder what made him rush out again. I hope he isn't in trouble. He said goodbye only on text and the funny thing was, I didn't receive his message until about 15 minutes later when I woke up because Keng texted me.

      In spite of the country's many troubles, people of the P.I. are glued to the on-going real-life soap which even merited the front page of dailies yesterday. I'm talking about the  urlLink Kris Aquino-Joey Marquez drama , which involves guns, physical and emotional abuse, sex, STD, women and fame (or infamy) unravelling right before the gossip-obssessed population. Ms. Aquino, daughter of assassinated Benigno Aquino, Jr. and former president Corazon Aquino, gave an interview last night to shed light on what happened, and as a reaction to, Marquez's (former basketball player, actor, professional womanizer, gossip show host, current mayor of Paranaque City and a possible candidate for a congress seat in 2004) allegations and early interviews about the end of their affair which, if Ms. Aquino was to be believed, involved his cocking a gun at her after an spat that started with a text message.  Can't we all go down any further than this? I mean, fine, these people are famous and they have loads of money that go with the fame. But really, to have their faces splashed on yesterday's front pages was silly. Publicizing the details of what should be a private, albeit sordid, extra-marital affair is stupid. (You can't blame Aquino of course, as it was Marquez who first gathered the press around him.) And for all of us to be stay glued to the boob tube and sucking up the drama was downright dumb. The peso has fallen by 19 cents against the US dollar, the President's popularity has dropped by 20%, kidnappers are having a field day, the G-22 block may be split by rich nations, the Jose Pidal heist is still yet to be resolved, there was a leak in the bar exams, but here go the tongue-waggers and everything else appeared unimportant compared to Aquino's nth tragic break-up with her nth boyfriend.

      What an utter waste of time and everything that's within its reach! I finished the stupid activity module (another "sexed up" term for PLAN), but when I was ready to submit it for checking, the person in charge asked, "Haa? What activity module? I need a flowchart for plan implementation."   Ooohh! Perfection at its worst. I don't know who I'm supposed to strangle, but before I commit any heinous crime that's worth a trip to the gallows, maybe somebody should be clear with instructions. Maybe I should give a copy of the first pages of  The Complete Idiot's Guide to MBA  to these people so that they'd know the difference between giving specific instructions and uttering nonsensical grunts.   This day is a total waste of makeup.

      I've come across this poem before, but I think it's rather more applicable now that I am older but hopefully wiser. I guess if I'm not careful, I'd grow old faster than everyone around me. And believe me, it's so easy to be old in this new office.     Don't Grow Old  By Melanie T. Lim   Many people are afraid of growing old.  I'm afraid of growing old and boring.  Many people are afraid of growing old, alone. I'm afraid of growing old, insane.   Many people are afraid of losing their looks. I'm afraid of losing my dreams.  Many people are afraid of losing their youth.  I'm afraid of losing my soul.  When you're 15, 35 seems ancient.  When you're 35, 15 seems juvenile.  A turnaround in a split second - two decades zoom past and before you know it, it's only a mile to the next millenium.   Don't' fear age- it's a right of personhood.  Don't fear death- it's God's greatest jest.  Don't grow old - you don't have to. Don't date because you're desperate.  Don't marry because you're miserable.  Don't have kids because you think your genes are superior.  Don't separate because you think it's fashionable.   Don't drink because you have troubles.  Don't gamble because you think winning is inevitable.  Don't philander because you think you're irresistible.  Most likely, you're not.  Don't associate with people you can't trust.  Don't cheat.  Don't lie. Don't pretend.   Don't try to buy your way into the kingdom of God.  Don't dictate because you're smarter.  Don't demand because you're stronger.  Don't sleep around because you think you're old enough and know better.   Don't hurt your kids because loving them is harder.  Don't sell your self, your family or your ideals. Don't stagnate.  Don't regress.   Learn a new skill.  Find a new friend. Start a new career.  Don't live in the past.   Time can't bring anything or anyone back.  Don't put your life on hold for possibly Mr. Right.  Don't throw your life away on absolutely Mr. Wrong because your biological clock is ticking and you can't afford to have your eggs harvested before the new millenium.  There's always a mad rush to something, somewhere but victory does not always belong to those who finish first. Sometimes, there is no race to be won only a price to be paid for some of life's more hasty decisions. You can't always go with the throng who could be wrong.  Sometimes, you have to be alone to be enlightened.  To terminate your loneliness, reach out to the homeless.  To feed your nurturing instincts, care for the needy.  To fulfill your parenting fantasies, get a puppy.  Don't bring another life into this world for all the wrong reasons.   To keep yourself warm, buy a jacket.  In the long-run, it will be less complicated and less costly.  To make yourself happy, pursue your passions and be the best of what you can be.   Simplify your life.  Take away the clutter.  Get rid of destructive elements - abusive friends, nasty habits and dangerous liaisons.  Don't abandon your responsibilities but don't overdose on duty. Don't live life recklessly without thought and feeling for your family.  Be true to yourself.  Don't commit when you're not ready.  Don't keep others waiting needlessly.  Fall in love - it's the greatest thing on earth.  But take care and remember, after the fall must come the rise.   Go on that trip.  Don't postpone it.  Say those words. Don't let the moment pass.  Do what you must even at society's scorn. Write poetry.  Love deeply.  Walk barefoot.  Hold hands.  Dance with wild abandon.  Cry at the movies. Take care of yourself.  Don't wait for someone to take care of you.  You light up your life.  You drive yourself to your destination. No one completes you - except you.  It is true that life doesn't get easier with age.  It only gets more challenging.  Don't be afraid.  Don't lose your capacity to love.   Pursue your passions.  Live your dreams.  Don't lose faith in God.  Don't grow old.  Just grow-up. Or even just continue to grow!

      It's been a long time. I can't find the chance to update when I'm at the other office because there's someone behind me and people can see my monitor. Another reason is that there are pesky system administrators who have nothing better to do than block hundreds of web sites. I'm wonder why they busy themselves with blocking sites when virus attacks occur almost every minute. So far, two computers have crashed because of virii, but of course,  they think it's wiser to block download.com instead. Puh!  Nothing much has happened over the past week. I didn't enroll this term and I haven't even registered for residency status. Benson texted me yesterday, I suspect, to tell me that he made it to the dean's list. Congratulations to him. Econ isn't for me, period.  Keng texted me in the past two days, telling me he couldn't get to sleep even though he had consumed two bottles of beer. He missed his early morning class because getting to bed very late meant getting off it late as well.  I asked him if there was something bothering him and he said yes. I asked him what it was, but he didn't tell me anything. Maybe me? Hmmm...  I really miss him and how I wish that I was there instead!  I'm downloading software right now--photoshop and acrobat. Gah, it takes forever to get completed!

      I don't I'm enrolling this term. I have simply lost interest in getting on with this program, and I really want to shift to a course that matches my quirks or something that I can really apply in my job. I have to get in touch with DLSU and apply at least for residency for this term so that I won't have to reapply should the wind still blow the other way. And in the first place, I want to concentrate my energy on something else.  I miss K. He hasn't emailed me since Saturday. I don't know what's up with him. His two emails really didn't make much sense, except for the part where he said that he emailed me so that I wouldn't think that he had just disappeared. I don't think he did. He just announces his existence only when he wants to or when it's convenient to him. *sigh*

      It's been a while since I last updated. I meant to update last night, but blogger seemed to be down and so I couldn't access my account. Anyhow, things are a bit normal and there's still no let up in my running around the place without getting anywhere.  I took a "removal" exam in my math econ course yesterday, and I won't be surprised at all if I flunk it. In the first place, I lost steam and didn't review at all even if I knew that I would take the removal exam to pass the course. I just don't care anymore. I don't care if I drop the program or what and all I think about is getting into something that would really suit me, not just one that I could finish with so much doubt about myself. La Salle still weirds me out and I don't understand their policies with registration and lost IDs. I forgot my ID the other weekend at APC, so when I asked the guard for entry permit, he curtly told me to talk to the OUR. The person on the other end of the line told me that that caused me to have a record with them, which would reflect on right conduct certificates. I mean, cripes! did I do anything immoral? I just left my ID (didn't do it on purpose) and how was that supposed to be a violation of good manners? Stupid gits!  K has emailed me twice over the weekend. The last one, I received yesterday where he said he was still at the librar at 1:00 in the morning because he didn't want to study at his apartment for fears of hitting the bed earlier or more often than he should. Lots of double talk, of course, as he mentioned "it" being sprawled in there and he might be tempted to join. I asked him what was being sprawled there. No answer yet. I hope it wasn't the self-proclaimed "girlfriend"...as in the girlfriend proclaimed that she was his gf. If only he knew! Anyway, they prepare their own beds, do they? I'm out of it unless it's my own relationship we're talking about. I only hope he doesn't marry her. At all.  Has just finished late lunch with Doj and Tin-Tin at Joe's Inato. I think the place is closing down soon as they've posted an announcement seeking new occupant of the place. Oh no, no more Inato weekends!   So what's left of the day? GMAT review, finish newspaper, do the laundry.

      I don't have a perfect grammar, but the way the writer of this letter murdered English was unimaginable. Read on.    To Marjie,  I am not surprise or wander why Dennis leave you.  Why?  What reason you can think about but you're very fat body. I thought before that Dennis only use me to his toy but sooner and later I'm realize that he really can't not beared or stomached to be with you anymore because at first,Dennis say he could not stand you're habit of making pakialam all his walks [lakad] and always calling to their house what he go home or this or that and then he say he get ashame to met iether in school or in his family and then asking you to exercise you're very very ,very fat body but you hate it thoughth your the most preetiest girls he knows about what do you think you are "Beautiful Girl " of Jose Marie Chan even you are beautiful face to your think) you do not have the right to called me whatsoever or else different name one time or the other for the real purposed to insults my personality because I'm never call you names iether in the front of Dennis or in the backs of Dennis, but if you start already to calling me different name, I don't have any other choice but to call you other different name to like you are a PIG, FAT, OBESSED, OVERWIGHT, AND UGLY SHAPE girl. Shame to you're body that is to a BUDING. You can't not blame Dennis for exchanging you to me because I am the more sexier than you when you look to us in the mirror. I'm repeat again that you are like Ike Lozada when she is a girl.  FROM: THE SEXIEST GIRL OF D.M.  P.S. You say that I'm the bad breathe but who is Dennis want to kissed. Me or you? You or me? And the final is me.

      Was at EQ, as usual and as expected, this morning. However, things were of a different tune at EQ because of the news that my boss gave me. Cecile had mentioned something about our boss's plan last week during our meeting so I was very curious and couldn't wait to hear it from her. Anyway, the gist is that boss is hiring me part-time at EQ until I have finished my obligations at KIN. Afterwards, she would employ me on full-time basis. That means work crisis is rather solved somehow and I won't have to be pissed off with the dismal working environment of KIN for sometime.  It was as if she knew that I would like to transfer and so we didn't negotiate at all. I'd be working 50% of the time at KIN and 50% at Eduquest. But the EQ pay would provide for an increase in 20% of my total salary from both companies, so it isn't so bad after all, especially now that I need money for my schooling. So work starts today and I'd be here om MWF and at KIN TTh. That's fair enough.  I don't want to sound too optimistic about the news although I am of course happy about it. I still want to be in a rather corporate setting instead of this one (even if dress code dictates: CORPORATE). Nothing beats being right there smack in the middle of Makati CBD. Oh well, this should be a stepping stone for something better and I'm thankful for the change.  I still have to sign papers and expecting loads of work which caused a lot of people here to resign sooner than expected. The funny thing is that this company has a high "mortality" rate. *sigh*  On the personal side, I'm like a sicko looking for anything that would make me feel as if I were any closer to him over the weekend and even this morning--checking our Yahoo Group photos where I found a couple of pics when we were in college. It's so nice to reminisce those carefree years and sometimes, I wish that I were back there instead, living out those four and a half years of my life and fooling myself that I had so much promise. But most of all, it was a simple yet happy life with classmates, friends, crushes and a  particular  friend.   I couldn't tell Tina that I had visited YU's web and checked out what it was like to be there. Somehow, I got a clearer idea of his life there--where he lives, where he works out, his environment and what he does. And I wish it was me beside him right now instead of that self-appointed girlfriend.

      I decided that I would attempt to make my trip to Nueva Ecija tonight, in spite of the hair-splitting major traffic jams in all roads out of the capital today. Imagine about five million people trooping out of the city to visit their dead tomorrow. Apparently, nearly a qarter of the city's population is composed of immigrants (such as myself) from the provinces. And during major holidays, everyone is just raring to get out of the city to visit loved ones (and for this particular holiday, their dearly departed).  Last Saturday was Mama's 50th birthday, but I could not visit her. She knew that I'd be home this weekend, so we would have a somewhat delayed birthday celebration for her. Last night, I bought her a pair of shoes that she could wear to work. That, and a silver trouser for myself on sale at 70% off! Haha!  It was weird that the Palace did not announce a nationwide holiday for today, even if All Souls Day is still to come. Usually, it announces that October 1 is also a public holiday to give the population the time to travel to the provinces (or sometimes, to the cities). But this time, only government employees were on paid vacation. *sigh*  Check out this site which discusses the  urlLink origins of the Halloween celebration .

      So the rumors about "right-sizing" at the new company were not just rumours after all. I've heard talks about it late last week, but got only a confirmation after the GM talked with the staff last Saturday, citing upper management initiatives to FURTHER downsize the workforce.   As far as I know, the "new office" needs more people as there are more work than the current number of employees can handle. Mind you, I am only working part-time, but I might as well be there everyday, considering the amount of work that I have to accomplish. And starting on November 8, I will be training about a hundred students every Saturday until the end of January.  But this isn't about me. It isn't so much about money either, because we had been briefed on the financial status of the company and so far, we are surviving and will survive in the future. It's about management that have these off-the-center, rubbish policies.   I guess I'm reacting typically. Blame management on everything, yeah. Although the staff is not entirely blameless, I think that management should still look upon itself and find better solutions to meet their profit margins. And it all boils down to meeting profit margins, such that when it is not achieved, the rank and file should suffer.   Gah, when I build my empire, I will really take care of my people.

      I think I'm just a bit depressed that's why most of today's updates are "on the read". Oh, but notice, my updates have almost always been mostly negative, right? anyway...  The ISIP launch last Saturday was a bit difficult to judge, whether successful or not, given that the guest speaker and supposedly funder of the project was absent--the rambolike mayor of our esteemed city--and was represented by his councilor son instead who obviously made an appearance so that people would remember him. Hell, campaign period is starting soon and I'm sure the mayor's spawn is running for another term at the city council. It's never too early to campaign, eh? And what worried us further was that the whole affair was at the company's expense and not the tax payers'.  I rehearsed (or attempted to) for the what-would-have-been a mayor-audienced demo, but since the troll wasn't at the event, the show still pushed through, but with a rather less stellar audience, namely, the city's constituents, composed of ordinary mortals such as students (who were not yet of age to vote) and their overworked teachers who I suspect do not have the necessary rational capacity to identify a bad politician from a  really  bad politician.  Anyway, at least my "products" were a "hit" with the kids as those were a hit with me the first time. There is an instant gratification in seeing your face on the monitor and listening to the recording of your reading a stupid passage and knowing that you read at the wayy-above-average level. Yay.   After the depressing affair, we thought we could still splendidize the night by fagging to death and demolishing several bottles of beer at GB2.  But then, here is a cool wannabe's lesson in partying: never arrive at a party place waaay early. A nine o'clock apperance is alright if you are eager but less important; two hours later if you are one of those fabulous people. We arrived at seven, so you could guess just where we stand in the coolness pyramid. Anyhow, all we wanted was to get drunk, really, and we would have been drunk more if one of the bunch wasn't picked up by her boyfriend too soon.  It was a disappointing weekend, but that should be the least of my worries. It looks like the company is chopping down jobs. How ironic, people are already leaving left and right and management is still cutting down more jobs.

      As my "new company" appearance was cancelled for the day, I spent the morning at Charter House and slept there till about 11 and then watched some news on BBC and CNN and back (or terribly late) episodes of  Ally McBeal  and  Charmed  on StarWorld. The "Donor's Conference" for Iraq, Bush's address at the Australian parliament (and heckling in between by a couple of senators), and the discovery of a new kind of steroid topped the news on both stations, while the "Secret Police" story was an additional attraction on Beeb. On business news, stock markets all over the globe were down, and Concorde was to make its final flight from London to New York.   I left charter at 1:00 and had lunch at GB3 Food Choices. This "food court" is pricier than the "for-the-mass-market" version of SM and Landmark. But since it was nearer, I decided to treat myself with a huge serving of fish fillet with curry sauce, fried java rice and broth. Sumptuous. Who cares about dieting?! It figures, GB is mostly a restaurant mall and you can find in there almost any dish you want--Thai, Italian, French, Chinese, Japanese, etc.--except for all-time fave, Jollibee foods.   I dropped by CD-R King to buy blank CDsas I had to make back-up copies of my mp3s and make audio CDs. If RIAA only knew! But I don't live on that side of the planet, so what the heck! Heheh...now I've got a hopefully working Wet Wet Wet CD, and the group isn't even American, but British. Scottish to be specific, Glaswegian to be precise. This band's sound is awfully sexy and Tin-Tin agrees that it makes you feel like you're spending a nice evening at a semi-decent pub...sans hookers of all stripe, of course.  Schedule at "new office" is as crazy as always. Apparently, the managers are heckling over EISs (my position, don't ask) time and attention and I have a hard time working things out between and among their demands since I (as well as the others) have no idea of to whom we really should report. Can anything be more stupid than that? Well, it's a fault with the system and there is an obviously gaping big black hole out there in the management universe. Methinks, gravity doesn't exist at the new office. It just sucks.

      I still have one hour more at work but I'm already too tired. My brain doesn't want to work anymore and my shoulders are hurting.   I encashed the check for my Sept 16 to 30 salary this lunchtime, passed by Rustan's to buy a new box of tea and had lunch at The Pancake House. Yum.   And I have just remembered that my Oct 1 to 15 check is still overdue.  I'm thinking of redesigning this blog. Make it more dynamic yet give it a more elegant, less cluttered design.

      I've just emailed Keng. I hope he'll reply soon.  Officemate and I are going out for a drink at Greenbelt. It's just about time that I "hit the bottle," even though we've just gone out last Wednesday. It doesn't always happen that I get to hit the bars on a Friday or Saturday night, so this is my opportunity to do so. Isn't it pathetic that I have to call it an opportunity?

      Still sillier things happen at the new office, especially that "energy vampires" or EVs are on the prowl, ready to suck out whatever is left of our precious energy. They can get pretty tiring, really. We bought a cake for our boss's arrival from a month-long respite in Las Vegas. Now, here is a good example about having your cake and eating it too, since we ate the cake too. Oliver and I even finished the leftover, in addition to a slice which Paul left at my table. Why he put it there is beyond me and I didn't want to ask because my attention was instantly diverted on to the cake. I guess he thought I could use a few hundreds more of calories. We enjoyed it anyhow.   Check this "splendidiser" stuff at  urlLink this site . Type a URL on the appropriate box and see your favorite website turn splendidly bogus. Bloody dash me twice!

      I've just watched " urlLink Underworld " which stars Kate Beckinsale, Scot Speedman and Michael Sheen. It's a nice movie, with lots of twists. Visual composition is also good--art production-wise and SFX-wise. Kate Beckinsale is a bit too small/skinny for the role, but she gave the character Selene, a fierce werewolf-hunter, some measure of vulnerability. It's a wild roller-coaster ride, with lots of gore and surprising twists and revelations, such that the bad guys aren't so bad after all, especially Lucien (played by very talented Brit, Michael Sheen).   And guess what,  urlLink ROTK trailer  was attached to the film, so it was more enjoyable. Thirty-foot Legolas looks mighty fine in that hood and blue... erhmm...contacts. And Eomer doesn't look like he's having hissy fit at all. Still can't decide who he was holding.  I guess I had been just movie-deprived in the past weeks, so I also caught "Once Upon a Time..." last night. It's not a very nice one, and would have been totally ruined if they didn't cast Johnny Depp. He was the film's saving grace and--following the popularity of his swaggering Jack Sparrow in "Pirates"--selling point. They way they depicted Mexico made it appear as if it was more chaotic than the Philippines. Bah!   I arrived at the G4 cinemas lobby just in time, since people were already qeueing for the film about 40 minutes into the scheduled screening. After buying my supersize Wendy's hamburger combo with biggie fries and liter-size iced tea, I fell in line to get a nice seat. It was weird that G4 didn't have seat reservations for the film. As I had more than an hour to waste on the qeue, there was nothing much to do but figure watch while nibbling my fries. Gawd, the lobby looked like United Nations--Northeast Asians, South Asians, whites with their girlfriends, partners, mistresses, hookers--with a few locals dressed to their party best. I didn't know Makati crowd was this vain. Hmmm... I guess they were trooping to the bars after the film.   If you have been a long-time visitor of this journal, you'd have known that I fancied Billy Boyd. Oh well, here's just a yummy  urlLink wallpaper  with angsty Bonden. Forget the guy in front of him as he's unimportant and the film could still survive without him--that is, if all moviegoers were like me.   Lastly, I visited one of my favorite cheap haunts and found this nice shirt that I could wear to work. Price: P98 or less than $2. Oooh! I'm a professional bargain hunter!

      I visited PowerBooks last Sunday and as I was crossing Pasay Road towards the bookstore, I uttered a short, albeit not-so-serious, prayer that I would run into someone whom I used to quite happily meet there a few months ago. It is my routine to check the magazine section before heading to the book shelves whenever I enter that particular PB branch. And so while I was browsing a copy of "Pink" magazine (something which I would rather not be caught reading), someone called my name. When I looked around, there he was, Bernard, carrying an open book copy which he was planning to read while waiting for his sister to finish shopping. (I assumed that the family driver's day-off was Sunday, so he had to take over the job.)   We updated each other about our respective works and projects. He teaches now for the "open" university, as well as, masters subjects. Good for him. I told him that I was spending more time with the sister company while still maintaining the web site. He asked me for documentation of our February project. After a few seconds, we hit that point when we didn't have anything to say to each other unless we wanted to talk about the weather or have a mini-debate about politics. Such talks are not recommended for people who wanted to be chummy with each other, but then maybe he did not want to step beyond the "acquaintance" border with me, so he had to leave me and that stupid smirk on my face which was caused by having my little prayer answered positively. I wonder if Bernard would have joined me longer if I were occupying a table at the café, the way we used to hang out at PB.    PB was selling old copies of hard bounds at really low prices. Pre-owned titles were sold for P99 (roughly US$1.80) per copy. I bought HP 2 and 3 hard-bounds, and another about the history of western civilization in the last 500 years for P99 each. The third one would have sold for at least ten times as much if it were not on sale. I chose it over Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" since I already had the paper back. But if the copy is still there by the time I visit the bookstore again, I would buy it.   For the first time that Sunday evening, I walked into a bar by myself for a couple of drinks. I just did not want to go home so soon, so I thought, what the hell! Go me, I did it on my own! I'm so used to doing things by myself anyway so going to a bar should not be any different. I have to admit it kind of felt weird that I was there on my own and everybody was with a group or in pairs. I was glad that no one mistook me for a "pick up", thanks probably to the huge book bags beside me. I guess people think those who read huge volumes do not go hooking around. Ironically, this city which has so many people can make you feel so alone sometimes. Everybody is just a stranger.   When I returned home, Tin-Tin told me she wanted to have a drink too, so we invited Doj and Po to come with us for a round of drinks. GB3 was already empty when we got there, and it was for our own good that the bars were already closing as we all had work the following day. We settled at Aubar, and ordered a round of drinks. After less than an hour, we left the place. I was of course very tipsy by then because I already had two shots of alcohol, which again managed to give me a slight hang-over yesterday morning.   My new part-time co-worker started yesterday. I gave her an orientation on the reading program that we will work on (hopefully separately) in the weeks to come. She is a foreigner who married one of our soldiers recently (something that happens about once in a million times), teaches English Berlitz, and used to (I believe) work with the Peace Corps. After the orientation, we invited her for a cup of coffee and re-introduced her to ciggies. I take a puff only when I report to the "new office".   I hope she'll enjoy her stay there, because I am starting to see things in a not-so-cheerful light: the way the company is being managed, the people that give it a semblance of a breathing organization and those in the lower to middle levels of the food chain.

      I still have to see "Revolutions" even though nearly all theaters in this city only show the film. I promise that I will go see it tomorrow night after a trip to the foot spa and Powerbooks.    I did some workout after office hours, and it was just wonderful to have a gym ready for our [paid] use in our building, even though the gym itself is not as spiffy as say, Gold's Gym, or any of those top-caliber places where people go to figure-watch while pretending to work out. Believe me, not everybody who goes to the gym these days goes there just to build muscles and lose extra pounds and the fats that goe with it. Over time, gyms have evolved to social halls where people gather and meet a mate, and I don't just mean the British sense of the word.  They are a tad too expensive to boot, too!  The gym, by the way, is noticeably near-empty, if not for my presence and those of a few couple of souls. I wonder if the usual patrons have joined the rest of humanity that troop to spiffy gyms to get mates.

      Just as I had feared, I arrived late at the office. Only this time, I can explain it and there was a valid justification, like, the monstrous back-to-the-big-city-after-a-national-holiday traffic. I was already on the road before 4:00 a.m., but it took the bus nearly five hours to reach Manila. I dropped off at the first MRT station and the mind-boggling number of people getting into the station made just going up to the station take about 15 minutes. That's just climbing three flights of stairs from the street to the platforms.  Anyway, as there was practically no time at all to drop by the apartment and change into a Monday wear (skirt), I knew that I had to break the dress code in order to  not  miss the meetings scheduled this morning. And that was when I had my first brush with a higher up, and about which I didn't care over the consequences, but just generally pissed off.   As my officemates and I entered the office from a 15-minute coffee break, the GM and the marketing manager saw what I was wearing, so one of them noticed and questioned loudly why "  that one wasn't wearing skirt  ". You see, this company has a dress code: skirts from Monday to Wednesday, no open-toed shoes from Monday to Thursday, "smart casual" on Fridays.  Our team leader, who has become my friend over time, said that I had just come in from the province. One of them said, "So?" but Ms. Team Leader, who happens to be a generally nice and gentle lady, could not muster anything smart to throw at whoever said "So?" Therefore, that meant I had to defend my semi-gaudy appearance and push my team leader out of the line of fire. I told Ms. Questioning Manager that "it was actually a choice between breaking the dress code or missing my [duly scheduled] meetings."  I didn't know if she was just surprised that someone finally had the gall to answer her, or that she was thick, or that she had to saver face, but she said the following:  "Why don't we get a scissor, cut short those 'pants' and re-sew it into a skirt?"  I took it as a silly joke and subtly laughed at her face, but inside my head I was screaming, "Let me see you try!"   The stupid hag!   When I build my empire, I will never embarrass my people in front of their colleagues.

        And do you want me 'cause I am hungry for something that will make me real Can you see me and Do you love me 'cause I am desperately searching for something real  -- Real   by Plumb    Like I told J last Tuesday, this year's Christmas didn't seem to excite me. Last year was definitely merrier than this one and I am glad that it's over, along with all the craziness that people have to do or go through as it approached. I didn't get to attend a single early morning church service. I usually attend the one held on Christmas mornings, but this one I really had to miss because I was just too sick to even get off my bed. There was the usual family (or clan) Christmas morning feast and I was really glad to have seen my nieces and nephews again. They're really cute and sweet, it made me think Christmas would never be as happy if not for the kids.   I promised J that I'd call him up last Christmas and so after mulling about it and asking myself why on earth I had to make that promise, I called him up and eventually interrupted a photo session with his family. He sounded cheerful and asked me what I received for Christmas. Lots of soap--I already have a lot in the first place.   I'm still on my Christmas vacation, but I had to be back in Manila to attend Menand's and Ronna's wedding. It was very romantic, very sweet and very organized. It had the stuff of dream weddings. I was also glad to be with my GL friends and as always, the boys made us all laugh endlessly. I just enjoy being with them because that's the only time I get to laugh as much as I like to.   J picked me up after the reception for drinks. Because I was wearing an evening gown, he chose a more formal place--Chateau 1771--in Malate instead of the usual pub / bar. We stayed there until 11, and then he invited me to see his LOTR collection. It turned out that his books were in his house so to my shock, he brought me to his house (or his parents' house) to see the books. We stayed there until 3:00 in the morning. Of course we did stuff that couples do, but only up to a certain point. I just don't want to have sex yet.

      Oh well, it's been forever since I last updated this blog. I figured that since I was writing more sensitive and revealing things on this page, and was doing so at the workplace with system admins ready sniffing for anything inappropriate just possively to annoy anybody, it was not very easy to blog at all and go unnoticed. The next thing I might know is that someone's pointing at me as the culprit behind this page, and that is not a very agreeable situation to find myself in.  Anyway, I'm doing this entry at my old office, which I believe I am about to leave in about a month, even though I am seriously considering NOT staying for very long at the new company. Call the new office a transition period, or a purgatory, where this drifter would have to cool things off and decide on where to land herself next and hopefully enjoyably. Life sucks when you take it too seriously.  I'm glad Norbert liked the watch.  I just didn't feel like going to KIN so early so I browsed some mags and books at NBS. I found a good, large print copy of "Maya" by Jostein Gaarder, but someone took it as I was browsing some trashy stories on the tabloid racks. So when I was about to take it to the cashier, it was gone and I could not find it anymore. Whoever took it was an ass and whoever bought it was lucky. I hope they were not one and the same. I bought a copy of "Seabiscuit" instead.   Next on my list is "Angela's Ashes" and I hope they still have copies of it at NBS or Powerbooks. I have read "'Tis" also by Frank McCourt, and it's a very endearing, funny, dramatic story of a boy who was born in America but grew up in Ireland. Before the Potter series, "Ashes" was the publishing phenomena of the 90s.

      I postponed my dlsu trip for Tuesday because I realized it might be better to get in touch with the registrar first before applying for a change of program. I received an email through our mailing list that the schedule for shifting was from Jan 7 to 27, so I have to fix my papers soon. However, I have to ask if it was ok to shift because even if I had already two terms' worth of residency, I only enrolled oficially in the first term. Oh well, I think that if I have to, I would completely drop my program since it is completely pointless to continue with it. I'm just crossing my fingers that I'd be allowed into a course that I am sure is more appropriate both for my professional and academic backgrounds, as well as for my career goals.  I was with Bernard for coffee, which extended to light dinner of dimsum at a Chinese resto at Robinson's Ermita. It was fun and we were talking about a lot of interesting stuff, the longest of which was his two-week harrowing experience in Vietnam when he headed the Philippine delegation at an ASEAN conference. Because of that unpleasant event, he's now calling them "gooks". Oh no.  We might see each other again on Sunday at the sci-fi convention at Rockwell. I am a Tolkien fanatic, while he's more into Star Trek, which is just out of my generation or that about which I have no knowledge. Hey, I am not a trekkie and I didn't grow up watching those outerspace folks blasting each other to smethereens, right? Voltron, Bioman, Shaider, McGyver, Airwolf and Care Bears better appealed to my taste than sci-fi, and I am glad that the LOTR movies were made when my taste could accomodate fantasy and my hormones were tuned out for hunks in either armors or green capes, or sporting furry feet.  I didn't see J today, but we got in touch through text, saying stupidly sweet (sweetly stupid) things.  I'm uploading ROTK stuff on Tina's streamload account as I am writing this. The server takes bloody ages to send things out. Yeesh! (An expression I got from J)

      This has always been one of my favorite essays. Maybe this time, I have finally learned the lesson and it feels good to re-read it after all the emotional storm that's been raging in my life. It's very hard to let go, but then what else can I do?  In case you fall into the same trap that I have fallen in, here's a good precautionary essay. These words are especially meant for the guys.     JUST FRIENDS By Susan Nikkaido   It happens on both sides of the gender line, but allow me to talk about it from my own female perspective.   A man meets a woman and begins to show interest in her. He asks her to spend time with him on a regular basis: hiking, biking, watching video. He calls her at least once a week just to talk. He begins telling her about the deeper things in his heart and invites her to share at this level as well. He sends her "friendship" cards and tells her that she means a great deal to him. He may become a little affectionate: the hugs begin to linger. The relationship has been defined as friendship, if it has been defined at all.   But after all this special attention, the woman is definitely feeling more. So she asks the guy what's going on.   To her surprise, he does a quick about-face. He insists they are just friends. After that, he avoids her, leaving her hurt and bewildered. She feels rejected - she has lost not only a romantic interest(she thought) but worse, a close and trusted friend. And she feels stupid. Did she really misread all those signals?   After I experienced this as a single woman, I asked my friend Joel to help me understand why guys do this. After I told him my woeful tale, he said, "I did that to somebody once."   "What? Why would you ever do such a thing?" I asked. "We were getting too close, and it scared me," he said.   This helped me understand why the "just friends" syndrome is so widespread. A guy wants to get to know a girl, but without the pressure of dating. So he spends a lot of time with her, treating her in many ways like a girlfriend but defining the relationship as friends. This way, if it begins to look like there's no future in the relationship, or he's not ready to "get serious", he can back away with no messy break-up. It sounds like a nice arrangement - for the guy.   But that approach can be a problem for the woman. If a man tells a woman he just wants to "be friends" but he treats her as if it's more than friendship, she will believe his behaviour instead of his words. It sets her up for a big disappointment. Or if he invokes the "just friends" mantra after being asked about the nature of the relationship, but then promptly begins to distance himself from the friendship, again, his actions do not match his words. He may think he's sparing her feelings by avoiding a break-up. But by defining the relationship as a friendship, he hurts her even more deeply when he disappears. A dating relationship comes with certain risks.   But she expects a friendship - especially such a close one - to continue.   Think about it this way: A broken dating relationship says only, "I don't want to marry you"; a broken friendship says to her, "I don't want/value you on any level."   Taking a woman down this path violates two scriptural principles. First, it's dishonest. The apostle Paul said that it was the way of the World - not of a godly man - to say "yes," and "no," in the same breath (2Cor. 1:17). A man of integrity will call a relationship that it is. Second, it is not kind or loving. The "just friends" approach may be safer for the guy, but it is harmful to the woman. In effect, he is asking her for rewards of a dating relationship -companionship, emotional intimacy, even affection -without the responsibility. He is playing with her heart, and her heart will probably get broken.   But what if a guy does only want to be friends - or wants to develop a friendship before he decides to date? It's pretty simple. He just treats the woman like all his other friends. He doesn't spend more time with her or call her more often than he does his other friends. He usually invites other people along when he gets together with her. He doesn't pick up the tab when just the two of them go out. He avoids compliments that might communicate she is "special" to him. He lets her know he spends time with other women. He's extremely careful about showing any physical affection - even playful shoves or hugs. If, after getting to know her from a safe emotional distance, he wants a deeper relationship, he tells her that he wants to date her.   What if you are not thinking about is more than friendship, but she asks about your intentions? Tell her you appreciate her friendship, but be honest about where you are. Above all, though it may be awkward for a while, continue to be her friend.   Years ago, I began to be attracted to a male friend. Though I hadn't really been getting any signals that he was interested in me, I knew it would help settle my emotions to hear from him. I asked. He affirmed me as a person but told me gently - but clearly - that he thought of me only as a friend and he did a wonderful thing. He kept being my friend. Though it hurt a little to learn I wasn't attractive to him in that way, it helped to know he still valued me and wanted me around.   This was nearly 15 years ago, and though we have both moved to different states and married, we are friends to this day.   Women can be great friends. But guys, unless you are ready for a dating relationship, please be careful to treat us "as sisters, with absolute purity" (1 Tim. 5:2), not as girlfriends, nor as something in between.   Your honesty - with yourself and with us - will be pleasing to the LORD, and prevent hurtful confusion for your sisters in Christ.    I went to "First Aid" salon at GB3. My first time there, and I was not disappointed. I love my new haircut--a slightly longer bob with layered ends. I gave a fat tip to the hairdresser. The haircut is worth a lot more than I usually can afford, but what the heck, I love my new hair and I hope it stays pretty after I wash it.

      Right. I have to break my promise that I wouldn't put another title on any of my entries anymore because I feel like this one deserves a title, which is also the title of the song that I am listening to right now:  People are People  by  urlLink D'Sound .  I finally find the lyrics of the song, which of course was found on the D'Sound's official web site. Go buy their album. This is a band that's really worth its salt.     People are People  by D'Sound  I am the one who believes in all that you say I am the one  who never wants to define herself I am the one  who?s paralell, upfront, behind I am the one paddling like crazy through the night  Refine, old time, colourblind Big sign, do time, doesn?t rhyme A lot, to much, standing tall And I?m crying in the valley: ?I shall never, ever fall!?  People are people and I feel so strong People are people and I?m going on  I am the one who stirrs it up everytime I am the one  who never knows how close she is I am the one  who?d rather be dead than confess I am the one trying to be good, wanting to be bad and so on  Excess, temptress, big mess Phoney, lonely, it?s a test Be still my heart, don?t you fail And I?m crying on the stagefloor: "I will always prevail!"      I have been feeling down for two weeks now. It comes and goes, but loneliness is something that I can never get used to.  I know that I have to re-assess so much about my life, on top of it is the love issue. I feel like I got trapped in a cycle of heartaches that I want to get out of. The only problem is that it is very difficult. I have come to understand those men and women I met and read about because now I know that I'm on the same boat as they are.  You can't just shrug the matters of the heart away because what makes things painful is the very core of the cycle: love. Love that makes you believe things will get better, love that keeps you hoping, love that gives you the strength to hold on--only to find out that what you have been holding on to is a mirage of what ought to be and not the thing itself.   I have been in that for years now and a wiser, stronger woman would have let go a long time ago. I thought I was wise and strong, but I was exactly the opposite. I had developed this weakness that I never knew was possible: holding on to an idea that has no hope of ever happening. It was easy with the friend. But the one before him and the one after him are altogether different matters. I have to let go of both at the same time and it is not easy, no matter how I try because I am fighting for my life and against my heart.   What pains me most is that I never had the chance to be what I really am, and that was because either I was never true to myself or they never wanted to see the real me. They had this idea that I was this two-dimensional character that one believed was just an intellectual but was weak and naive enough to be manipulated, and the other one believed was a bookworm who was good in bed and nothing else. I am all that, but I am more. I wish they would somehow look behind the packaging, see what's behind the face and realize what is inside my heart.   All I need is a chance--a chance to be the real me and a chance to be a better person. Maybe then I would gain back the chance at happiness.   I used to be happy and how come I never realized it. Sometimes, it's easier to be just by myself than open my heart and let somebody walk into it only to shatter it into pieces.  JJI, if you are reading this, realize that this is also about you.  You say that you've found the one and that you also realized that we had things in common. If you're keeping a checklist for "the one", then why not also keep a checklist for "the other"? You would be surprised. You say that she's smart. I am smarter. You say she's a gifted singer. I am too, you just haven't heard me sing from my heart yet. You say we have a lot of things in common. I say we have more things in common than you realize. Open your eyes and look behind the facade. Re-assess your checklist.   I don't keep one myself...and that probably is the only thing that spells all the difference.   In case you haven't realized it yet, I love you. I am just too scared to say it because I'm afraid that the words would drive you away. But it doesn't mean that just because I don't say it, it doesn't exist.

       "Kiss that girl goodbye..."   I was with Kodi the other night. For the uninitiated, he's the "mushroom bf" whom you could have the temerity to call bf, but couldn't prove even to yourself if he really was. He could declare himself your man, but wouldn't give proof that he still was.  Anyway, I discovered this card sitting on his desk, among books by Paulo Coelho that I thought he bought. I was actually surprised that he had copies of Coelho's books since this author must be one of the phoniest, worst pseudo philosophers since phoniness was invented.  I got curious, so I opened the card and lo and behold: It was from a "friend" and was given along with Coelho's books. She (I'm pretty sure about the gender) told him that the books were her gifts and were a way of reminding him of her love, so he could "feel me". It sunk in after a few seconds that there were two of us. That the reason why he wouldn't be with me within the first week of his current visit was because it had to be her who he'd rather have in his hotel room and not me.  I felt cheated. I felt cheap. He knew everything--nearly everything--about me and still he still would lie. I asked him who she was and told him he lied to me. He told me that he didn't say that there was no one  new . I answered that I didn't ask if there was someone new but that if there was someone   else  . He answered his famous line, "I hope I won't lose you."  F*cking shit, how is that ever possible when he never wanted me in the first place? I am just a replacement and he has been hurting me all these years. I thought that he had stopped two years ago when he confessed that he was sleeping with five different women. It hurt so much. I still can't believe he did it. How could he? I had been true to him all these years in spite of the hurt. I have forgiven his unfaithfulness but he didn't even cared whether he'd be hurting me or not. What's worse, everybody at the hotel knew about it. They saw me coming in and out of the place to be with him, but I was the only one clueless about the other woman who also frequented his place.  Maybe God has finally shown me the way. I was praying to him that I finally wanted to be happy and that I might just give Kodi up. It just hurt so bad that while I was holding on for years now, there was someone else that he probably cared about. I hope that God will finally teach me how to be happy and show me happiness. I am so tired of having to fight for someone's time, attention and affection. I am very tired of having to be relegated at the bottom end of the list, as the last priority.  God, I just want to be happy. I just want to find him. Is that so impossible?

      Honestly, I wonder why we have to put a title in a journal or a blog. We don't use titles when we make entries in our paper journals, do we? Do we? Hell, no. So I guess that I have to stop using titles whenever I have to make entries starting today, since it's silly in the first place, putting a title in your journal. Life doesn't have a title but your name and you put one only when your life is written and sold in book form or movie or in whatever form that strikes your fancy.  I miss Jeff. Funny, I told him that this name sounded too high school-ish and saying that called to mind somebody pudgy whose face was peppered with zits. But for the sake of not divulging who he really is just in case someone who knew us came across this blog, I'd call him by the more common name, Jeff. Like I said, I miss him and it's been two weekends that we haven't gone out. I wonder if he has already gone tired of me, although we still get in touch by text or chat at the office or see each other during coffee breaks. But other than that, there is nothing else and I wonder if he still plans to still go out with me or has the interest fizzled already? I don't blame him, even if it hurt my guts last week to think about it and I was already feeling desperate that I almost maxed out my charge card. Thank God, I had more sense in me to remind myself to spend money wisely and save up just in case a rainy day comes. But then, having a nearly broken heart is similar to a rainy day, isn't it?  I shouldn't think too much about him and it's time to really have a life whether he's in it or not. It's his choice anyway if he really wants to stay and I have no control over his decisions. I can only affect it up to a certain extent, but how I can live my life and choose to be happy is all up to me and my Maker. It's funny now that whenever I pray, except for something specific such as the safety of someone, I only tell him how I really want to be happy. Because apparently, when all is said and done, it all boils down to how fulfilled you have become and how happy you turned out to be. It doesn't count which specific person is with you, as long as you are happy and you have allowed others to share it, that's what matters. I don't want to insist anymore to keep this whoever in my life and hope he'll love me for the rest of his life.   Damn! That song on the radio  Miss You Like Crazy  is sooo just right in time, isn't it?  "I miss you like crazy / No matter what I say or do / There's just no getting over you..."   I have finished uploading the TTT soundtrack on Paddy's streamload account so I can download it into my pc at the office. It's just too bad that the network is super duper slow and I wonder how we are ever going to be productive when we need a faster internet instead of one that runs on age-old frame of system admin's mind: make network run really really slow so that people wouldn't browse the internet too much, and that will make them more productive. Our system admins must be the stupidest system admins any company could get, and someone is approving their existence there.

      I didn't know it's been more than a week since I updated this page. This is where I put all the sensitive details of my life, and not updating doesn't mean I didn't have anything worth writing about in the past week. In fact, I had, only maybe because too much excitement, happiness, loneliness and whatever was bugging my mind kept me from being productive and so I had only touched the keyboard to "google" whatever crossed my mind, send messages to friends, etc. Things that didn't concern the inner me, the demons inside my head, the joys and pains in my heart.  Many times, I really wish that I didn't feel so much. Life would have been easier and better. I wish I were like, say, Jeff, who breezes through his life without so much worry about work, relationships, friends, whatever. I may be doing him a disservice and is being unfair to him in writing what I wrote, but having known him for months now and hearing from him myself how he had pretty been on the safe side of things, I have to say that I envy him. He doesn't worry about material things, no--whatever he wants comes his way. He has to wait a little, but things happen the way he wants to. He needs love, there are more women out there who love him, although there may also be just as many who hates him. But who cares? If there are people out there who love you and make you happy, then the rest of the world can hate for all it wants and you will still be alright, right? Too bad, sometimes I love him and sometimes I hate him, but whatever I may feel for him for the moment, it's not him who's hurting but me. I wish I could just make him love me the way Kodi or the rest of the people I know had loved me, and everything would be fine. Just fine. Maybe one day he will find out all about it, and I will have to explain why I do the things I do with him. He is right when he said, "there is more to this than just..." You are right, Jeff. There is more to everything about me than what you see. There is more to what we've done than what you believe and what you suspect. Even if you already suspect that I love you. There is even more to it than that. I wish I didn't fall in love you, but I have and I didn't even mean to. I wish I had treated you the way I had treated, say, Danny who loved me so much, but I just could not for the life of me fall in love with him. Why does it have to be you? What do you have that I liked? Is it because of all the things we have in common? I never planned on anything, I never meant to see things the way you did, I never even meant to be that part of myself whenever I am with you and yet, you set something in me that I should have kept hidden--even expunged--just so I wouldn't feel this way, this lost, this confused and hurt and sometimes furious because I failed to put a lid on my feelings and rule over my heart.  My stupid heart. I thought I was wise, and people see only that most of the time. God, if only they knew! Do you or they know how many times I've cried because I feel so helpless?  Or how many times I have longed for the good times that passed? You see, it would all be easier to see the world only through your mind and leave your heart out of it. I have to be honest that I am happier from my mind and not from my heart. I tend to know what is right and do what is right in stead of feel the wrong and right things all at once and be helpless.   I just want to live. I just want to be happy. God, make me happy!

      I woke up this morning, still shaking from lack of sleep. Thing is, I accompanied Jeff last night at his office while he was working on the database system for his client. We thought that it would be finished by 10 pm, but it took him till 1 a.m. to perfect the system. I helped him in writing warnings in his dialog boxes and acted as his sounding board when he had to think aloud. It would have been so much fun if I were not so sleepy, tired and hungry.  He treated me to midnight meal after we left, though. So all in all, I was glad that I got to be with him last night.    He asked me to accompany him in buying a birthday gift for his friend's child. Too bad, I can't back out anymore from the movie date with officemates =(  Talk about wrong timing!   I'm so depressed. I feel so trapped. I have never felt so down in my life than I do now. God, please save me!

      I decided to do Friday Five meme today.    If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  All sorts of Asian food, except very exotic ones (i.e.: iguana, snake, etc.)   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  Either books, coffee or bath stuff   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  nonfiction. history or biography   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  no idea.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  jazz and ballads  ----------------------------------------------------- It's really weird that Jeff has been very quiet lately, when we had just spent time together last Monday.  We did not get in touch yesterday and would not have got in touch today if I "accidentally" sent an SMS for Jane to his number or greeted him when he logged on to IM here at the office because he had to finish a project he left hanging when he went to transfer to a new company. *sigh*  Not again, Lord!  Apparently, he has plans for tomorrow so that means we are not going out. Good thing that I'm wallclimbing with Jane and RJ tomorrow. Otherwise, I'd be stuck wondering why he's not asked me out or what he's doing or if there is something wrong and we don't get in touch as much as we used to. This is so depressing and it has been hanging like a dark cloud in my head for weeks now.  I thought that today would be THE big day because I was supposed to have finally been interviewed by the company that I'm applying a job for. Unfortunately, it turned out that I had to be interviewed by FOUR managers and only two were at the office this morning, not to mention that I had to wait for nearly two hours to get interviewed.

      I noticed that I've been remiss in visiting my old online haunts. Gawd! I miss the old days, it makes me ask all the time what the heck happened. I mean, I used to be okay and just at peace with the world and life and now... bleh!  Sorry, but I just can't help feeling horrible about my life these days, and I wish it weren't so. There just isn't so much to be joyous about. Job sucks, lovelife doesn't exist (talk about being in-love with someone who doesn't even care about you!), gym work became uninteresting and badminton games are blasé. Crap! Crap! Crap! Help! Get me out of here. (Sorry, God, if I seem to lose my faith. Please take care of me. Please grant me my prayers!)  Honestly, I miss the days when I could go online and participate in message boards, troll NDs and be a little foolish every now and then.    Check out the  urlLink Calcium Kid trailer . The film of course stars the ever-yummy Orlando Bloom.

      I've come across these funny management lessons before, but now that I am working for a slightly different evironment with a slightly screwed up view of management, these gems come in handy:     MANAGEMENT COURSE...    Lesson One:   An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit saw the eagle &asked him, "Can I also sit like you &do nothing?" The eagle answered: "Sure, why not." So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.   Management Lesson? "To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up."    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lesson Two:  A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy." "Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "They're packed with nutrients." The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.   Management Lesson? "BullShit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there."    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lesson Three:  A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.   Management Lesson? 1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. 2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!

      It has been a busy week for me, peppered with a series of job interviews. I guess I am not wrong after all in pursuing the marketing profession, as I had just realized that in the first place, I have been in marketing and PR for most of my professional life. Heck, it started even before I graduated from college.  Anyways, I am glad that I have things to look forward to and distract me from other worries, such as toxic managers, generally low morale at the workplace, not being able to see J on a daily basis, my still tight budget in spite of the relatively high pay. Thank God (I mean, really!), there are bits of positive developments so I don't feel so bad anymore. I am really crossing my fingers that I would finally get this very nice job for which I will have my third interview next week. I got this lead through a headhunter where I submitted my résumé. They asked me for an interview for last Tuesday and it went really well. The headhunter next sent me for an interview with the HR of company itself, and I think that it also was good because before the nearly hour-long session ended, she told me that she would schedule me for an interview with the manager of the department where I would be assigned should I get the job. I got worried that it could be just one of those "we will call you later" bluff that actually meant that I didn't get the job, but the headhunter informed me that the HR actually requested for another interview on Monday. Unfortunately, I'd have a consulting conference on Monday so I hope she won't mind that I asked for the meeting to be scheduled the following day.  I watched  urlLink  Love Actually   with my teammates last Wednesday. It was fun, watching the film with them. The movie is also good, although it didn't match my expectations. Next in line:  urlLink Hidalgo .  Looking forward to a not-so-boring weekend, unlike the last one. Gawd! I hated that weekend. There was absolutely nothing to do and in my depression, I stayed up all night browsing the internet and updating my  urlLink Friendster  profile. I even came across J's profile so I added him to my friends list. He approved my request.   I scheduled a wall climbing gig for tomorrow with Jane and RJ. I hope it will be lots of fun. But first, there should be something to look forward to tonight. Should be.

      I want to share this lovely piece I found on Peyups.com, a web site for the UP community. I strongly identify with the writer, although of course my story is slightly different. Am I already losing faith, or am I, like her, already starting to move on? I don't know for now, but I do believe that only tomorrow holds the answers, which by then will not be so painful if they are on the affirmative. In the meantime, until we find out in which star's company we will end up, here is another gem of a writing about someone else's heartbreaking story.      "Just like the manner by which ice cubes freeze bacteria within their crystal networks, as long as they remain frozen, everythings safe. There is no need to worry.   But somehow, you still manage to permeate my system, as if it were an expertise or a tediously-learned skill. Moment by moment, you profusely enter my mind, filling my awareness with lost memories of once-upon-a-times and whatnots. Remembrances of holding hands, afternoon walks, lunch outs, text messages and phone calls. Of yesterdays seemingly unbreakable promises and proclamations of forever.   I shouldve put into mind what an old friend once wrote, Forever is not real.   ...   And just like that, you vanished, very much like a soap bubble floating across air. I have watched you in complete awe, wonder and even fascination. And similar to any ethereal fleeting moment, you were gone, leaving me clueless as to whether you even existed in the first place.   So maybe what we had was love. Maybe I loved you, and I hope to heavens that you loved me back: even just for a split second when we held hands, or during that moment when I looked into your eyes, or the time when I laughed at one of your silly quirks. Id be content with that idea, Id be content that in the course of our friendship, there was a moment of mutuality; even if it was so quick I never noticed it all.

      Another exam and interview yesterday afternoon for another call center. It was one of those application exams that I enjoyed, and where I knew I did well. I got a 90% on the aptitude test (no prior review, mind you).   I was very excited when I submitted my application for this company. I thought that it was a call center located somewhere at  urlLink Tower One  along Ayala Ave. I was so excited more on the location of the office and not about the work. But anyway, I arrived early and went through the usual application drill. Unfortunately, the office was just a recruitment agency for call centers and not the company itself that was supposed to hire me. Towards the end of the interview, the recruiter told me that my salary expectation was very high, as in, around 8 grand more than what the client wanted to pay me.  It was no good. How depressing.  Right now, I think that I'd try to stick it out with my current job but wouldn't cease looking for a better employment. There must be some opportunities out there in the vast ocean for a small fish like me.   I had dinner with officemates last night, and then watched "Duplex" afterwards. Jeff texted me if I wanted to see him just as we were about to leave the moviehouse. Yay. I met him last night. It was fun. Too bad, he isn't available for tonight. I want to watch "Runaway Jury". Today is his last day at our mother company and he'll be working for Accenture starting Monday next week. ( Sheesh! "Home to Stay" is on iTunes. How proper. How depressing. ) Gone are the mid-morning and late afternoon coffeebreaks, but I hope that we'll still see more of each other even if we won't be working in the same building anymore.

      I went to eTelecare for my application exam for the customer service associate position. I took one IQ test and a situational exam wherein I had to write down what I would do in three situational questions about being a CSA. The exams were a breeze, but I had a hard time convincing myself about taking the job in case it was offered to me. Thank God, the application process didn't finish this afternoon and I was scheduled for an interview on Monday afternoon. I don't feel like going through the interview, but I'd like to keep my options open.  As we were being called for the scheduling of our interviews, one of the applicants approached me and asked about my surname, where I was and what was my father's name. I unwittingly answered him, only to find out later that he was looking for his long lost father, whose name, unfortunately was like my father's. In short, he thinks Papa is his "Dad". Yikes! I don't think that we are siblings and that my father had a child with another woman, and it's not that I am defending him. Because if this Dennis was my bro, then I'd accept him. But then, the idea that my father would have a child with another woman is totally out of this world. Weird. He may have had his lapses when he was younger, but I don't think he went to that extent. No way.  Unfortunately, this kid seems bent on meeting my father, and it worries me.

      The days, I am either very tired or on the ends of my nerves because of work and career and relationship crises. There is just no letting up with all the toxicity at the workplace and mixed signals from him. I just wish that I could just escape from everything, drop all my assignments and say goodbye to all the toxic people around me. I am glad that I have friends among my officemates to whom I could confide my problems and discuss the emotional trauma that I've been going through for weeks now. (I could not keep myself from crying last night and I was just glad that Marianne decided to stay with me until I felt better. Thank God for people like her.)   There are times during the nights when I wake up feeling very tired and worried because I know that when morning comes, I will have to face the same set of people and be hurt by what I learn and realize. And there are times during my sleep when I forget to breathe.   I used to be alright and I used to be happy, and I didn't know that because of what I was, people around me became threatened. Because I don't say things that they want to hear, because I invite the attention of others whose eyes they'd rather have for themselves. I am so tired. I am worried. I always have to watch my back all the time--figuratively and literally.   I wish that J would see the real person behind all the facade as well. I am worried that he's moving to another workplace come Monday. Why can't I just keep people with me--those people who matter, instead of the ones who always mean to hurt me?   I am very tired. I am not happy.

      Big Fish told me that Intercon called me up earlier, just as I was about to enter our office yesterday. It made me a bit worried because it was she who answered the call, and she of course had an idea of what the call was all about--an invitation for interview. I acted nonchalantly and thanked her for telling me about the call. Intercon called again around 10, and I still missed it because I was on a coffee break. I was glad that this time, though, Mayet answered the call and she took the caller's phone number and forwarded it to me when I arrived. I called the number, and Intercon invited me for an exam for a training position. I asked the girl on the other line if I could take the exam this morning. She said ok.   Late again in the afternoon, I received a call from Digital Rendition for an interview. We scheduled a 2:00 PM interview for today too. I'd be in Ayala area anyway, so I'd instead take Wednesday off going from one building to another for exams and interviews.   I must have been too excited over the invitations, that I hardly slept at all. So this morning, with barely 3 hours of sleep and an empty stomach, I went to Intercon's office at RCBC Towers (the spiffiest building in all of Makati). There were other people at the office applying for customer service positions. About 30 of us finished the official application forms and took the first leg of the exam by 9:00. After the first leg of the exam, around 12 persons were left for the second leg and that included myself. The others who were not invited to stay were told to apply after 6 months.   We took one set of test each for grammar, customer service and planning skills. The last one was pretty tough, but I pulled through. After the exams, we were divided into two groups of six persons each for typing and listening skills. This part was the easiest, of course. After the last test, we were scheduled for interviews in the afternoon. When my schedule was set for 2:00 PM, I could only be glad that I was on the first batch so I was able to bargain for another slot--4:00.   J 's office is at GT Towers, which is just right across the street from RCBC. When I told him yesterday that I would be at RCBC, he promptly scheduled a lunch date and a dinner-movie date in the evening. I met J at the lobby by 12:10. I didn't enjoy my food--a super duper sweet lemon chicken and soggy rice--because of the exam and interview jitters. I was hoping that I'd already be off by 3:00, but it turned out that it would be one of the longest days in many years, so I just tried to relax and planned how I'd spend the afternoon and take one interview after another. J stayed with me and even showed me around his building's café. By 1:45, he walked me to the GT lobby and reminded me to keep texting him about my activities and especially when I'm already done with all the interviews.   By 2 PM, I was already at Rendition Digital, but my interviewer was still out on lunch (at 2:00?!) so I had to wait for another 30 minutes. He was an American and the firm's standing CFO. They were just setting up their office at Multinationalbancorp Bldg. when I got there and I remarked about it. He said that they've just set up the firm, but the funding is pretty stable. They already have a number of projects which would require them to hire around 100 people and occupy the entire 15th floor. Hmmm..impressive. It's an IT outsourcing company.   The interview went well. It lasted for about 45 minutes. He asked me for another interview for Friday at 4:00.   I was back at Intercon by 3:15. I went straight to Starbucks for my latté which was upsized for free. Yay! I texted J about my progress, and it kind of weirded me that he asked about my birthday. I've told him before, but it didn't stick with him so he asked again. I don't know what he has in mind and I hope that he has something special for me for my birthday. God I hope so! *crosses fingers*   After freshening up, I was back at the Intercon office for the interview at 4:00. It turned out that there would be two interviews for that afternoon so I stayed at their receiving area for about 15 minutes for the first interviewer, a cute guy with a reinforced American accent. The interview was ok, so I was asked to stick around for the second interview, which was about how I conducted training. I must admit that I wasn't too scientific and methodical in describing my training process.   The second interviewer asked me if I could still wait around for the third interview (!!!), but I declined and asked her if we could have it the next morning or in the evening. She invited me to be back there instead tomorrow at 7:30 AM to make a presentation, and then at 7:30 PM for the interview with the HR Manager. I wonder how many interviews I have to make to get the job. I'd like to get it, of course, but the only thing that holds me back is the graveyard shift. It's the customer service arm of the Intercon, so that means operating 24/7. Still, I find it weird that they have to hold trainings on graveyard schedules too.   I was finally done by 5:00, so I waited for quite sometime outside GT Towers for J. We were picked up by the PowerPlant shuttle at 5:40 and made it to PowerPlant mall by 6:15. We went to the Casio repair center for his watch, and then had a short dinner. We next watched "Hellboy". (For all the praise that the critics gave to the movie, I still think it was insufferable. J didn't enjoy it either, I could tell.)   It has been a generally happy day! I wish there'd be more days like this. I was so tired, I lacked sleep, I was stressed out, but I was happy because this day had purpose. I enjoyed the environment too, which was very different from APC. And most of all, I was with J during my free hours and he took a long lunchtime to stay with me. He must have seen that I was very tired by evening, so he was extra sweet. We held hands and hugged each other whenever we could. For the first time, we held hands while watching the movie, haha! I was so tired after the film, and I regret it a bit that I told him that I wanted to retire already when he asked what else I wanted to do.   I still can't believe my blessing. I'd like to have more happy days like this.

      I had a very busy weekend, which started with a dinner-and-movie date with Jeff. I was glad that he invited me last Friday since I wasn't expecting at all that we would go out that night. I hope that even if we won't be able to go on "gimmicks" in the next two weekends, we'd still be together for dinners or whatever we could fit in to our busy schedules. I miss him. He texted me this morning, and told me the same too. Haay! Sana totoo!  Unfortunately, though, the dinner turned into rantfest because it had been a bad day at work, ergo, I wasn't much fun to be with and I must have bored him to death with my angst. He was good enough to steer the course of our conversation from work to a topic that I don't remember anymore--anything to distract me from my worries.  I spent Saturday afternoon with friends from work. We scheduled an ukay-ukay trip to Pasay, and we had so much fun buying all those "vintage" clothes for very very low prices. I hope we'd have more trips like that especially now that we have to update our wardrobes when the rainy season arrives. I bought four skirts--one ethnic- patterned knitted skirt, one wool (which I'm wearing right now), one white balloon with eyelets and one green velvet. I also bought two shirts to go with the skirts, a black leather jacket, and a plaid wrap, all for the grand total of less than P700. I would have spent ten times as much if I bought those items from the mall, but thank God for cheap haunts like those we visited last Saturday. After shopping, I accompanied two of my friends to my dorm, and I'm quite afraid that one of them got convinced to share a room with me. I'm not so sold on the idea of sharing rooms with officemates. I hope she'd still back out. It's like she'd be privy to my private life, and I don't like it even if we're friends at work.  I bought a pair of white shoes for the white skirt yesterday. I was so surprised that it was very cheap--P150 or less than $3--because of a shoe sale at Woman. The original price was P599, which was reduced to P299 and further to P150 by the time I bought them. Yay! I bumped into Christine at the department store, so we did our shopping together, had snacks at The Soup Kitchen and coffee at Figaro before heading off to Rustan's for our grocery.  Gotta go now for badminton games.  ------------  Update: The gym was locked. No badminton games today. Grr.

      I think that the long pre-new job break that I was looking forward to enjoying would be forefeited as I still have complete going the rounds for my clearance. Otherwise, I won't get my last paycheck along with, I found out after asking the Finance Officer, portion of my 13th month pay. It won't have to be tough afer all, but it still doesn't amount to a lot. I just want to get my money so that I won't have to go hungry before the new company pays me which hopefully will happen on or before June 15th.   Mr. Z gave a copy of the employment contract yesterday. After signing the papers, I sent it back to him immediately. I am now a new employee. yay! I only wish that I'd last in this new company, grow professionally, have a stable career and generally have a better life. It will take some hard work, of course, but some things in life are just worth what we can offer back.   I'm helping my friend, Marianne, submit job applications since she's conducting a week-long training somewhere. I hope she'll be hired soon. She deserves a better life outside eq which doesn't give a thing about her worth. Wish us both luck!

      I'm just waiting for 6:00 PM so I could leave the office and head off to my 6:30 PM interview with Mr. Z. Sweet Jesus, why am I feart? Help me!  He's finished doing the round of reference checking. I gave two names as my reference, but only Marianne is available. I guess Clarence is out of the country, so he couldn't be contacted on both mobile and land lines. So I gave him Elai's number and he was able to get in touch with her. He also asked for Tata's contact info and they talked last Monday. I am still not sure if I should be glad that I gave Norbert as reference, but he surely was. They must have talked about Z's business and eventually they scheduled a meeting for possible business partnerships.  I am not doing anything productive at EQ anymore. I'm just doing research about whatever I might be doing in my next job--TQM, PM, Customer Service, Marketing, Training and E-Learning Design--and printing them out so I could read them at home. At the same time, I'm chatting with J who apparently is being paid this week for pretending to be productive. Haha! He's lucky!

        Mr. Z has finally made the round of calls for my reference checking. He had been calling Clarence since Friday, but the call couldn't get through. I asked Norbert to be my reference instead and gave his cell number ("Hmmm... interesting number!") to Mr. Z. I'm glad that Tata gave a good word for me, and I thanked her for it.  Apparently, the theme of the entire call was about my aggressiveness. Crikey! That was one of the last things that I'd call myself. I mean, I do have my way with words, but I hardly ever been thought of as agressive until I applied to this company. I consider myself a people person and I've learned to reach out to people, received quite an amount of attention from those around me, but it's all about me being friendly and articulate. I try not to suck up to people as much as I can, while putting myself on equal level with everyone. A lot liked it, except for Ms. Big Fish in the Fishpond.  Anyhow, Elai called me up after Z talked to her and told me about the interview. Marian also told me what they talked about, and I figured that he asked the same question to them, including Tata. What's funny was that he told them that he got to talk to someone who said that I was a bit too agressive. Something about it made me a bit uncomfortable because for one, nobody told him that and I am sure that Tata didn't do it. Two, he's a little cunning, nuff said. Too bad, he's cute.  As if I didn't have enough of cunning and/or manipulative superiors. First, it was Mylene. Now, it's Ms. Fruity. Don't tell me that he's next in line.  Grabe na 'to!   I finally handed in my resignation this morning to my immediate superior and Tata.   ----------------------------------------------------     Must Get Out   (Maroon 5)  I've been the needle and the thread Weaving figure eights and circles round your head I try to laugh but cry instead Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said  Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for Try to guide me in the right direction Making use of all this time Keeping everything inside Close my eyes and listen to you cry  CHORUS: I'm lifting you up I'm letting you down I'm dancing til dawn I'm fooling around I'm not giving up I'm making your love This city's made us crazy and we must get out  This not goodbye she said It is just time for me to rest my head She does not walk she runs instead Down these jagged streets and into my bed  Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for Try to guide me in the right direction Making use of all this time Keeping everything inside Close my eyes and listen to you cry  There's only so much I can do for you After all of the things you put me through

      I went to another interview yesterday. I submitted too many applications in the past weeks, that I can't keep track anymore of all the companies and positions that I had applied for. So yesterday, I didn't know for what position I was supposed to be interviewed, but I went there nonetheless to see if I might like it.  It turned out that it was for a training/writing job. A bit boring, if you ask me, but the interviewer dissuaged me on the first five minutes of the interview from further applying for the position. I was annoyed that if they already knew that I wasn't qualified for the position, then why the heck did they ask me to be there in the first place? I told him that I was still interested and that I was capable of doing the job. I didn't have to beg him, but told him why I was qualified for the position and I was ready to do it in no less than perfect a manner.   He eventually asked me to be back on Thursday for an exam. Actually, I've no intention of going there at all on Thursday. I just don't want the stupid company to say no to my face. Nobody says NO to the pretty. They wasted my time and they should have looked closer at my resumé before inviting me for the interview, or what's a resume for?   I had lunch with J yesterday. He went to APC to fix his clearance papers and asked me to have lunch with him. We went to Greenhills--where it was nearly impossible to find a parking space--and had pasta at a somewhat Italian restaurant.  He lent me his Maroon5 CD so that I could make a copy for myself. I kind of introduced him to their music, as well as to D'Sound. He eventually bought the CDs. Haay! I wish that God would grant my prayers positively.

      Here is something that Des posted on her Friendster Bulletin Board. It's quite touching, and those of us who have either gone on or stayed behind can see glimpses of ourselves in this essay.      Why do we have to meet only to lose in the end? These are questions left unanswered, word left unsaid, letters left unread, poems left undone, songs left unsung, love left unexpressed, promises left unfulfilled. In a relationship, one of the hardest things to do is saying goodbye and letting go. It's as hard as breaking a crystal because you'll never know when you'll be able to pick up the pieces again. More often than not, they who go feel not the pain of parting; it is they who stay behind that suffer, because they are left with memories of love that was meant to be a love that was.   At the beginning and at the end of a relationship, we  are embarrassed to find ourselves alone . Unfair as it may seem, but that's the drama, the bittersweet and the risk of falling in love. After all nothing is constant but change. Everything will eventually come to its end without us knowing when, without us even knowing why, and we must forget not because we want to but because we have to. In letting go, sorrows come not as single spy but in battalion.   It seems that everywhere you go, everything you do, every song you hear, every turn of your head, every move of your body, every beat of your heart, every blink of your eye and every breath you take always remind you of him. It's like a stab of a knife, a torture in the night. Funny how the whole world becomes depopulated when only one person is missing. Just imagine there are four billion people on earth and yet it seems you feel lonely and empty without the other.   I don't know if it's worth calling an art, but letting go entails special skills sparkled with a considerable space and time. Time heals wounds but it takes push on our part. Acceptance plays a part. Not all wishes come true. Not all love stories end with "happily ever after." We hate to suffer if it would mean happiness to others. We have to cry to temporarily let go of the pain. Every beginning has its end like every dawn has its dusk. It's something we can't control, something we have to live up with. It's over, he's gone. But life has to go on. Goodbye doesn't always mean forever.   There will always be a place and time where questions will be answered, words will be spoken, letters will be read, poems will be recited in the night, songs will be sung in harmony, love will be expressed in solitude and promises will be fulfilled. Somewhere, somehow, someday.     (Shared by Joe Gatuslao, Bacolod City,Philippines)

      It's Labor Day and it's a holiday. Which means there is no work today. Which means I don't have to be at stupid Eduquest. Which means this is my first real weekend since February. It won't be long until I have real weekends, but I hope I'd get a new job soon.   The past week has been quite eventful, and it was nice for most of the time. However, something turned bad towards the end of the week and now I am really really worried. I have to leave the company in a month, and although I have job prospects, nothing is sure yet. I still have to receive a job offer in spite of the numerous interviews that I've been in and most of those have even reached to management levels. It means that most employers I'm a good candidate. But good isn't good enough, given that there are dozens of others vying for the same positions. Best should be it, and it's just hard to be the best in a sea of competitors for the jobs. I just pray that God will give me a job soon, especially before my money runs out.  This company really messed up everything, and if not for the fact that I met J while working there and have found friends at work, Eduquest is such a waste. They delayed my paycheck which forced me to get money from the bank to survive.  When my salary arrived regularly, everything still went into a tailspit because the cost of being an employee of Eduquest was just staggering: getting to work by cab everyday, wardrobe updates, expensive means. I never spent the way I did until I was worked for EQ. I wish I don't have to say it, but the truth of what I wrote still remains whether I keep mum with my feelings about the company or not. I should have pursued my applications months ago.   With Atlas, I only worked with a Chay. In DPSI, there was just one Mylene. At EQ, there were the Marys, Apples, Dangs, Cecilles, Raymonds and all sorts of backstabbers that I never thought possible to exist all at the same at the same place.  I was so disappointed with the lady boss.  It will take pages to describe what is going on at EQ and how these people mess up everything, but I don't have the energy to do that right now. May be at a latter date.  I don't want to hate people. But sometimes, having a little anger inside is just the proper way to deal with things. At least I don't have the burden anymore of having to please people who have been prejudiced against me in the first place.

      I missed updating my journal. I am not sure, though, that whatever I want to put in this journal is worth the space and bandwith and the effort to write at all.  I was in a long, almost boring yet important meeting with bank client yesterday together with the online branding team and Mr. Z in Eastwood yesterday. More than the project-cycle-related importance of the meeting, what actually required us all to be there was to do damage-control. As I understood it, the expectations of the client were not met because the project management process which they agreed on was not clear and therefore was not implemented according to the expectations fo both parties. In effect, the output was bad and so the client shot it down. When the feedback was sent to the project manager by email, he forwarded it to the copywriter and the latter replied in a not-so-subtle manner. The manager in turn "paraphrased" the copywriter's remarks in his point-by-point reply to the client's point person, who just happened to be the VP of this company (which belongs to the Fortune 500). Mr. VP of course did not appreciate the manner by which his feedback was handled, most especially the manner and the tone of the e-mail he received. He complained to Mr. Z who eventually ended up spending hours upon hours apologizing and doing damage control. This led to an emergency meeting where clarifications were made and all members of the parties involved were present in the negotiation table. Mr. Z involved me eventually to be the "voice of the client". The meeting was productive yesterday. We controlled the damage and the account was not lost.       The meeting took so long that it was already 8 when we reached back Ayala center. I was still planning to do my reports last night, but the boss decided to hold the management committee meeting on Tuesday so that we could still work on the reports on Monday. The e-mail server bogged down due to rains (whaaaat???) that affected the wireless networks of our mail ISP. I still couldn't open my email as of last checking.   Boss called his Dad while we were on the car. They spoke in Spanish. After the conversation, I told him that I understood some of it. He was surprised. Told him I had Spanish classes in the university and that I sucked. The point, I said, was not to fail. Hehe!       The Makati Cinemanila opened last Wednesday, and there are a few films that I'm looking forward to see:  Girl with a Pearl Earring ,  Bus 174  and  Osama . I guess I'll see them tomorrow. But today/tonight, I'm heading off to PowerPlant to watch  POA . I've seen the film twice, but I didn't enjoy the experience because of troublesome tummy and awful seating arrangement. On the first screening, I was right there on the front rightmost side of the front row and so my view of the humongous screen was pretty much distorted. On the second screening, I ate a bad food so I didn't get to finish the film. Figure out why. HOpefully, this time, it would be a trouble-free viewing experience.       I still haven't got in touch with the Baguio "office" to discuss the wireframes for Monday. Heck, Manila Hotel had already agreed to sign up with us, but they asked for more functionalities on the system. We have to come up with a good plan for Monday. But darn it, the programmer is still out. Groan!  Happy weekend everyone!

      I'm just taking time off from my very busy work sked to update this journal. It's been two weeks since I last wrote an entry, and ages since I made a rather meaningful one. I've never been busier in my entire work life than I am right now, but I've no complaints. I like what I do and I don't mind spending long hours at the office to finish things. Can you say I'm enjoying my new life now? LOL! Given the contrast between this company and Eduquest, it's safe to surmise that EQ must have s*cked big time. It still does, but at least I don't have to suffer the back-stabbing barracudas in that company.  But to give them credit, I am glad that at least I learned a minimal thing at EQ, which convinced my current boss to hire me. A few days into the new company, he already asked me to come up with a training plan meant to be included in the marketing and client support program for our online reservation product.  (Have I mentioned that the boss is cute too? Too bad he's my boss and too bad he's already taken. Mr. Furball dropped by my table before leaving the office.)  I'm working now as Senior Associate for our marketing support center. The 'center' isn't as big as a center would, but I still have to do quality work for the Level A-obsessed higher-ups. LOL!  Mr. Furball just asked me today to jump into the web marketing campaign for another client. *sigh*  So my life basically revolves around my work, and J and I haven't dated for a few weeks now although we always stay in touch everyday. Told him my boss was cute and he said he was "jealous". Jealous my foot!  Jane sent me an e-mail about "work motivations" this morning. I would have related better to the list if I were still in EQ.     If you do a good job and work hard, you may get a job with a better company someday.  Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job WRONG fourteen times gives you job security.  Sure, you may not like working here, but we pay your rent.  A person who smiles in the face of adversity ... probably has a scapegoat.  If you can stay calm, while all around you is chaos...then you probably haven't completely understood the situation.  Your job is still better than asking "You want fries with that?"  If at first you don't succeed - try management.  Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid altogether.  Teamwork means never having to take all the blame yourself.    Here's a treat for you Smallville fanatics out there: http://aces.tabulas.com/sp00kslane/thumbs/Animationa1.gif Michael Rosenbaum is totally groovy!  Till next time!

       And the heart is palpitating, dern it! It must be because of the 2-and-a-half mugs of coffee that I downed today. Or maybe something else. God, I'm so cold.      Anyhow, it was a boring weekend. I was planning to drop by at the office to work on my backlogs, but the weather was just so condusive to staying indoors and so I didn't go out that much, except when I watched "Imelda" last Saturday. Alone. Not with anybody else. Not with a particular anybody else.      It feels weird, though he was sweet as he YM'd me that he'd be leaving for home. The rest of the day he was almost cold. I don't know what's going on inside his head. I hope that I still have that space in his heart.      God, help me but I need some sign that this is all worth-keeping and I have a reason to hope. Please! Please don't let me lose him. Please let me keep him for good.                   YOU WHO NEVER ARRIVED      You who never arrived    in my arms, Beloved, who were lost    from the start,    I don't even know what songs    would please you. I have given up trying    to recognize you in the surging wave of the next    moment. All the immense    images in me- the far-off, deeply-felt landscape,    cities, towers, and bridges, and unsuspected    turns in the path,    and those powerful lands that were once    pulsing with the life of the gods-    all rise within me to mean    you, who forever elude me.      You, Beloved, who are all    the gardens I have ever gazed at,    longing. An open window    in a country house-, and you almost    stepped out, pensive, to meet me.    Streets that I chanced upon,-    you had just walked down them and vanished.    And sometimes, in a shop, the mirrors    were still dizzy with your presence and, startled,    gave back my too-sudden image. Who knows?    perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us    yesterday, seperate, in the evening...        --Ranier Maria Rilke    (Translated by Stephen Mitchell)

      Thank God, it's pay day again. It's funny that nobody orders food delivery whenever it's pay day. I had lunch with Dex and Ryan at Food Choices today. On our way to Greenbelt (Sosyal! Pa-Greenbelt ang Lola mo!), the driver of this new resto in Pasay Road gave us a leaflet promoting their restaurant. What actually caught my attention was their offer to pick customers up from their offices so that they could have lunch at this restaurant. After lunch, the resto's shuttle could then bring them back to their offices. Hmmm...good idea. Maybe I should ask my colleagues to try the resto and see if they'll deliver on their promise to pick us up from our bldg, bring us to the resto and take us back after lunch.  I've interviewed three applicants so far. And so far, no one has yet satisfied me or my colleague. I am looking for someone who has strong statistics and research background, while the other guy seems to be more intent on hiring someone who has communication skills. I know that comm. skills is very important, but I think that a candidate's knowledge in conducting research should weigh more than their ability to speak in English--notwithstanding our expat bosses. They'll have to conduct surveys, in the first place, collect and analyze data, manage information and make recommendations based on the data gathered. I hope we'll find a good hire soon.  "King Arthur" and "Around the World in 80 Days". There doesn't seem to be any end in interesting movies that I'd like to watch. This weekend is going to be abother movie weekend again.        So I lay my head back down And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours I pray to be only yours I know now, you're my only hope  Sing to me the song of the stars Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again When it feels like my dreams are so far Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again

      I was at Eduquest last Saturday to have my resignation clearance signed. Unfortunately, Tata and the HR person, who were supposed to sign it so that my unclaimed salary could already be prepared, were not around to sign it. As Tata won't be back from her [another] month-long trip from Europe until the end of July and the Admin lady was recuperating from an operation, well, they won't be able to sign it till probably start of August and my check won't be available till September.  *Groan!*  What a bummer!  I almost missed J since he was still in class by the time I was on my way out. I already reached the highway, when J called me up to tell me he could have lunch with me, so I had to get a cab back to apc. Good thing, he decided to meet me instead. We had a really, really short lunch. Gawd, I missed him so much. It was more than a month since we saw each other before Saturday, although we kept in touch everyday through YM and text.  It's still not enough though. I hope it won't start a pattern of monthly dates. I hope we'll be together more often than that.  God, you know what I'm wishing for, and I hope you'll grant it to me. Pleeease, pretty pleeease! Amen.

      I am soooo very very very tired. Gawd! It's almost awful, but what can I do? I have to finish my marketing plan (or at least write down my scattered ideas) for the third quarter. It all started last Tuesday, when I presented my seminar's slide show to boss (while hoping that it would end by 7:30 as I would be picked up by Jeff for dinner), and he suggested a few improvements--really, just some key areas that I forgot to include, not mistakes that were committed. Haha! Anyway, during the discussion, I told him that it almost bothered me that we still didn't have a concrete marketing plan. They were about to finish the Business Plan for the third quarter, and yet there was no concrete, definitive marketing plan which would be the basis for our strategies and activities. I guess it struck (stung?) him, so the next morning, he called us for an emergency meeting to identify key areas of our marketing approach. At the end of the meeting, Z asked us to come up with a marketing design to be reviewed by Friday EOD. Therefore, the reason for why I am tired right now.  Actually, it wasn't the designing thing that caused me to be still here at past 8:00, but the fact that I had to sit in the wireframes review--you know, that stage of software design where you have to identify functionality areas--for nearly four hours. I ended up starting the design by 4:00 PM. *sigh* I miss Jeff. I wish I were with him all the time.

      It's only Tuesday and yet I'm already very very tired. Gah! I worked last night until 8:30 PM for my presentation due this afternoon. And I'm only half-through as of this writing :( Why I'm writing my journal in the middle of a busy workday? To ease the tension. It's so damn stressful!   It's funny that when Marianne and I were chatting about J yesterday, he suddenly popped in to invite me for a night out. Kakatawa! I told Marianne what happened and she agreed the guy has a strong ESP.   OK, gotta get back to reality now. I hope the rest of the day (as well as the evening) will be pretty. I'm glad that we've been having fair weather since weekend. It's so sunny outside, it doesn't feel like it's supposed to be rainy season.   Ciao!

           "It's out of our hands,We can't stop what we have begun..."  --Leann Rhimes, "Looking Through Your Eyes"      These past few days has been a whirldwind of meet-ups and EBs. It made me soooo busy that I didn't even have the time to fix my bed properly.     Remember when I said about the PB forum? Well, I joined the EB for the first time last Thursday and got to know a few of the PB members. These guys are the wackiest group in the whole badmintonlandia, I swear! After the 3-hour badminton meet-up, about 8 of us went to have post-games dinner at a Chinese resto until 2 AM. We were the rowdiest group, everybody was just cracking jokes.      Then some of them made an impromptu lunch meet-up the next day. I wasn't planning to join them anymore, but Rookie texted me a couple of times before the meet-up. I met them and had 2-hour-long lunch. I'm glad that my bosses were not at the office when I returned from lunch, or that would have been a few points taken from me. The PB guys still asked us to skip work instead and watch movies then party at night. It was just impossible for me not to go back to work and party up. I was exhausted from the previous night's debauchery and there was sooo much work to do at the office. Rookie was with me on my way to my office since he had to visit someone at a building just across from mine.    But then, the texting did not stop until 5 PM when I told him that I had to sit in a meeting. We chatted on YM--mine on my office PC and he on his ultra-spiffy GPRS pc fone. Gawd! I'd like to have one of those. I already guessed that the guy was up to something. I just didn't know why he chose me. I already have a reputation for being shy among the rowdy PB forum ppl. The thing is, they're so rowdy that it's hard for me to keep up. *sigh*       That Friday night, he texted me again to ask me if I would be available for Saturday night. Last night. Hmm...since I didn't have any plans, I said yes. Then we texted some more till I got home. Since my fone was acting up, we talked instead on landline--from 10 PM to 2 AM! We went out last night, but that was a group date with another PB would-be couple: Shannen and Rookie's best bud, Bobet. I really had a great time last night. We had coffee, then billiards, bowling and late-night dinner in QC. We dared him to sing on the karaoke, and by whatsinthename, the guy sang! I didn't expect that in a million years, but he did sing. He brought me back at 2 AM. Then we still texted each other until 4:30. This morning, he sent me another text to tell me he was on his way to Pangasinan. And to ask if I would be available tonight. Well, I would be so I'm meeting him later.        I told Jane about the developments of the last few days. It's so nice to chat with her about these stuff, and I am sooooo glad that her lovelife is looking up too. I'm so happy for her and I pray that Elmer would be it. Go girl!     Ang gaganda natin!
