      Although Jennifer Love Hewitt was no where to be found, Bailey Salinger got married this weekend.  I am married myself, but I still let out a little sigh when I found out that another had captured his heart.  And...that "another" is none other than Kelly from the Real World New Orleans. Remember Kelly? She was basically non-existent - she had the doctor boyfriend for whom she ended up staying in New Orleans.  I guess things didn't work out there - big shock.  Oh, and her last name was Limp...Ewww...lucky she married Mr. Salinger.   Meg Salinger. That would have been a nice name.  ;)

      My friend Tina was here this weekend, and we had FUN.  On Saturday, we went to see Bombay Dreams on Broadway.  On Sunday, we walked a lot and did some shopping, then had a bar-b-que on my roof. But, most of the fun happened on Monday...  There is this guy at my church who was having a birthday party in Brooklyn.  Well...because we are so friendly and social, and because Tina wanted to check out this guy (for another friend), we decided to go. But - it was about 65 degrees and pouring down rain. We were told that the party was under a cover at Prospect Park, so I figured it was okay to put on some cute clothes and shoes for the party. I was big time wrong.  This was a cookout in the rain. Like, the shelter was a bunch of trees.  And the ground was muddy. And we had to stand there holding umbrellas the whole time. And the table was soaked - like bags of chips with droplets of water on them. Disgusting. And my new silver shoes got dirty.  Ugh.  But, we were troopers for our friend's birthday.    Oh, and to top it off, we took about the longest path to get to Brooklyn ever, we missed our stop, had to go back...it was a mess.  Then, we had to walk around - in the rain - to find a Grocery store to buy food for several people at the party.  Then, we had to walk through the mud in order to get to the cookout location.  It was SO FUN!!!  Tina definitely got a unique, yet very real, New York experience...

      http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,14207,00.html  If Marc Anthony is married or engaged to JLo before the end of the summer, I will indeed puke.  What kind of pill is JLo giving these guys?  I mean, she's hot, but puh-leeze!!  I don't really understand why else Marc Anthony would do this. If his ex-wife filed for divorce in January, it shouldn't be much longer for the divorce to be final.  She obviously doesn't care if they are married anymore. Why not wait it out a little while?  BECAUSE he's been DRUGGED by JLO!  What's the big deal with JLo?  I know that most, if not all, of you have looked at JLo and thought - she's hot. Those eyes, that skin, that giant booty.  The cars, the bling, the clothes...she is definitely not "Jenny from the Block" no more. Wouldn't it be nice to have a little bit of that?    But...JLo has one giant flaw.  Although she clearly has knows how to cast her line and hook 'em (either that, or the drugs), the poor thing has no idea how to reel 'em in.  There must be something wrong there.  I see a clear case of "looks aren't everything" here.  So, take JLo's man misfortune to heart, and know that just because you LOOK like you are perfect, it doesn't mean that you are.    Oh, and if they get married before the end of the summer, I probably won't puke. But, I will sigh and say "Poor Marc."

      I laughed about once a minute during this movie. It is hilarious. I love all the new cartoons - Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and the Shrek series.  I can't wait for the rest of the summer movie season...today, I am going to see Saved! with my girl, Mandy Moore. I'll let you know what I think.  "Catnip!" "That's not mine."

      http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121031,00.html  My third year in law school, most of my friends in law school got engaged.  So did the rest of my law school class.  So did most of my non-law school friends.  You can bet the talk about engagement rings, the carats, the cut, the color and the clarity, was rampant. Looking back on it, it makes me a little sick.  When a man gives the woman he loves an engagement ring, he is telling her he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.  That is a BIG deal. Way bigger of a deal than the size of the ring he gives her.  Think about it - a guy you are crazy about goes into a store, talks with a sales clerk, figures out all the specifics about diamonds, then plunks down a wad of cash to buy a ring.  A piece of jewelry.  All to let you know how much he loves you.  People!  That's HUGE!  It's just as huge if your diamond is 3 carats or .3 - it's time for the size obsession to stop.    And, maybe one day, we'll all be lucky enough to get an upgrade to a bigger diamond. Or, maybe we'll be even LUCKIER and, in 5, 10, or 20 years, have a guy who is still just as crazy about us as he was the day he bought that first ring.  No upgrade necessary.  P.S. Sorry all my posts are from foxnews. I'll try to branch out next time.

      So, Fantasia wins.  Oh well.  I didn't really care either way...but, Fantasia's screechy voice, while interesting and different, isn't the best for radio. So, we'll see how she does.  Last night, I dreamt I was friends with Ashley Olsen.  There are many, many things wrong with this...why would a perfectly normal 26 year old have a dream where she was hanging out with an 18 year old famous twin?  And, why oh why, would I suggest that we go to the Bronx Zoo for fun? And even more confusing - why would she look at me and say, "Oh, so we can, ya know...drink?"  In the dream, I just said..."Um...No."  And woke up.  Two nights ago, I dreamt I was friends with Britney Spears.  Again, many things wrong with this. Britney is a little trashy for me.  She is a fame-hog.  She dates nasty trailer-trash guys.  In the dream, we were hanging out in this restaurant at 4 in the morning. I called my friend Kimberly and made Britney talk to her.  Kimberly screamed into the phone and made Britney go deaf in one ear.  I woke up.  That being said...I am afraid to go to sleep tonight.

      For the past couple of weeks, I have been rewatching all of the episodes of the first season of Party of five - and it is taking me through the ringer.  Do you guys remember that show?  The show where some guy who looks like Tom Cruise and his brothers and sisters have to live on their own after their parents are killed by a drunk driver.  I knew I loved it, but I forgot how much...until now.  I have cried in almost every single episode...the one where the Salingers find out that the drunk driver has been let out of jail, the one where Charlie cheats on Kirsten, the one where Bailey gets kicked off the football team, the one where Julia finds a tape and thinks her mom had an affair.    I have also been reminded of my first TV crush, Justin, Julia's first boyfriend.  Oh, how I loved Justin.    Go to Blockbuster and rent Party of Five. Watch it. Love it.

      From e-online:  CHIC CHINOS: Sarah Jessica Parker tapped to be the Gap's new pitchwoman in print and TV ads through the rest of the year. It's the longest-running endorsement deal signed by the clothing manufacturer yet.   Okay. Everyone just think for a moment.  Now, who believes that Sarah Jessica Parker ever wears clothing from the Gap?  And if she did wear a tiny piece here and there to feel like the "regular people," who thinks she would ever have a whole wardrobe from the Gap?  Or even one whole outfit?    Although I LOVE SJP, I am a little bit over celebrities - especially those who so obviously flaunt their couture tastes - posing as regular people who shop at stores like the Gap, Old Navy, and, my goodness, Payless Shoe Source.  Does anyone believe that Star Jones owns even one pair of shoes from Payless?  I don't think so.  Her feet would smell really bad, like mine do every time I wear a pair of shoes costing less than $15.    Now, Jennifer Lopez pushing Louis Vuitton, that I buy. But, let's put regular people, i.e. 6 foot, 110 pound models, in Gap ads for goodness sake.

      For those of you who don't know, there is a huge debate over the presence of African Americans on the Journals at Vanderbilt Law.  On visitation day, BALSA wore t-shirts with a 0% on the front and, on the back, a statement about how no blacks have been selected for the journals in a while.    Although the journals have changed their selection process each of the pasttwo years in order to create more diversity on the journals, no African Americans have been selected.  The journal staffs met, talked with the faculty, and voted to keep the process the same - but the faculty overrode them and created an entirely new system.  However, it seems that this was not enough.  A battle is heating up.  If you still have your vandy login and password, log into the VC and read the postings.  If I remember correctly, when I went to Vanderbilt, the postings were pretty tame.  Now, people have full blown out racial battles on the public VC message boards.  Pretty crazy.  I will post some examples in the comments.  What do you think?

      Imagine...a hot slice of pizza, a big screen TV, and Seth Cohen.  What could be better?  This past year, every Wednesday night, I have either set my VCR to tape the O.C. or frantically called one of my friends to tape it for me and send it to me.  It was the one show I couldn't live without.  And now, Fox has made a shocking move...one that has me a little, but not TOO, worried.  Fox, knowing that the O.C. is the only "Must See" show on TV right now, has decided to take a big bet and move the O.C. to Thursday nights next year.  I can't say I'm surprised - the O.C. truly is a must see event.  But, moving it to Thursday is also a huge risk - one that Fox seems prepared to take.  I'm, for one, looking forward to watching it smash "Joey" next year.  The only problem is - I am one of those who still loves Survivor.  Maybe CBS will switch its time slot too?  Seth Cohen.  *Sigh*

      Okay, so, I love me some American Idol. Some Clay Aiken. Some Kelly Clarkson. Some Ruben Studdard.  But, I'll tell ya. I do not love me some Fantasia Barrino or Diana Diagarmo.  I mean, Fantasia is quirky, fun, and has those huge lips (which I can relate to), and Diana is cute, young, and smiley.  They are both okay. But, American Idol?  I don't think so.  Where is George Huff when you need him?

      I love to talk. You guys all know that.  You know me - all the time talking, giving my opinions, sticking my nose where it doesn't belong, stuff like that. So, I thought a public forum for my talking would be an excellent idea!  Don't you?  I begin talking.  Now.

      I just got a hole in the first pair of designer jeans I ever bought.  I was going to New York for my pre-bachelorette party, and I needed something "cool" to wear out. So, I decided it was okay that I spend $120 on a pair of jeans.  You know, "fancy jeans."  It was the best purchase I ever made.    Everyone kept telling me how skinny I looked. They just fit me so well.  They were low, but not too low, the perfect dark denim color. And, they had designs on the pockets so everyone knew I was wearing cool jeans.  I felt special. I proceeded to wear them the entire weekend in New York, and four times a week after that for the next year.    Since then, I have purchased a few more pairs of "fancy" jeans, and they have lost their special-ness to me.  But I will always have fond memories of my first.  I encourage everyone to go out and purchase a pair.  They will make you feel good.  And, it will be fun to mourn them when the eventually pass away.  R.I.P., my Jeans.

      Today, instead of surfing the web, looking for entertainment anecdotes...I spent the entire day researching Fahrenheit 9/11, looking for arguments for and against. Shockingly, most of the arguments I found were against. Imagine that...  But, not to be political, because that is not what this site is about, let's discuss a far more appropriate topic. That is Pop Stars and Broadway.  From the imdb.com news - Moore To Join 'Wicked' Cast?  Acting and singing superstar Mandy Moore is considering a starring role in hit Broadway musical Wicked. The  Saved  beauty told fans on her official website about her love for the Wizard Of Oz prequel, which has won several theatre awards including three Tonys, since its launch last year. Moore enthuses, "Wicked is beyond amazing. I've actually seen it twice and was offered the chance to replace Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda) once she leaves the show. What an honor. But how could anyone step into those shoes? She's pretty unbelievable and irreplaceable and totally owns that role. Although I have to say that I'm obsessed with Idina Menzel (Elphaba). To me, she is the ultimate singer/performer and her voice blows you out of the water." Former New Kids On The Block heart-throb Joey McIntyre recently joined the cast of the New York hit, as partyboy Fiyero.  Okay, so I have mixed emotions about this. Those that know me know that I LOVE Broadway. Love.  For example...I saw Cats 7 times. I saw Les Miserables 6 times. I have seen Rent 5 times, and will probably see it again.  Phantom 3 times.  Even Wicked and Avenue Q, both new musicals, I have seen twice. Suffice it to say - I am a Broadway fanatic.  (great site www.broadwayworld.com - if you care).  Usually, when I go see a musical that has a "celebrity" in a lead role, I absolutely hate it.  I have seen John Stamos in Nine, Tom Cavanaugh in Urinetown, Steven Webber in the Producers, John Secada in Cabaret, and Rick Springfield in Smokey Joe's Cafe. I have probably seen more, but that is all I can think of...or, these are the bad ones.  After I saw each of these people in their respective shows, I was disappointed. I wanted to see the shows again, because I felt like I got jipped.  I paid $100 to see some guy, not made for Broadway, perform in a show to get the experience.  Ugh.  It is really annoying.  Only twice have I been impressed with a "celebrity" in a Broadway show.  First, I saw Joey Fatone in Rent. He was really good. I actually was shocked. I had low expectations, and he exceed them.  Then, I saw Hugh Jackman in Boy from Oz.  Cmon people. He won the Tony, deservedly.  He was amazing, and they are closing the show in September (last I heard) because they know that the show is nothing without him.  The funny thing is, though, that I have been wanting Mandy Moore to do a Broadway show. I truly think she is extrem've seen Wicked, Ga-lindayouely talented. She can act, and she can really sing.  I mean, SING.  These silly pop songs she has recorded don't do her voice justice.  I have heard her a couple of times, belting out more classic tunes, and truly, her voice blows me away.  So, I am really excited about this bit of information.  It's true, no one can replace Kristin Chenoweth as Ga-linda, but I think Mandy might just give her a run for her money.  Of course, I do feel sorry for Idina Menzel's eventual replacement, because she truly is completely and totally mesmerizing.  Of course, seeing Joey McIntyre as Fiyero would be hilarious.  But, that is just an additional perk. Seriously - a New Kid and an NSyncer on Broadway. Who would have thought it.

      oh why oh why oh why...  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5297716/?GT1=3584  So.  Britney is officially engaged.  To an ugly thuggish dude with a pregnant ex girlfriend.  Could she be any more trashy?    Britney - you are beautiful. You are talented (she can dance, people). You have millions of dollars.  You have a super hot ex boyfriend, which obviously proves you can do much better.  What are you smokin??  I hope you have a super tight prenuptial agreement. Because, honey - you got lots of dough, and he ain't got no flow.  I wonder why he might like you so much?    And, dear, just to make it clear to you - Justin does not CARE who you date, get engaged to, or marry.  I certainly hope that you are doing this because you really love this guy, not just because you want to prove to your ex that you are over him, nor just to beat him to the altar.    I always wanted Justin and Britney to get back together, but I think I have officially decided that Justin is WAY too good for Britney.  Long live Justin and classy, sassy, anything but trashy Cameron.

      I can't find a link, but I just saw on the news (Today show) that DMX was arrested for stealing a car at JFK airport last night.  Why?  DMX SHOULD have lots of money. He is a famous, successful rapper who has sold tons of albums.  He doesn't need to steal a car.  Of course, I don't know his situation. Maybe he has had a rough time lately. Maybe he has run out of money. But, I'm sure his rapper label friends could lend him a few bucks to buy a car.  I mean, drugs are one thing - you can get addicted to that.  But, stealing a car?  Seems silly to me.

      I don't know if any of you watch American Idol. But, I do.  I love it.  See, I like to sing, and I'm pretty decent. My friends actually ask me to sing in their weddings and stuff.  I also always wanted to be famous, but never really had the drive to get there.  But, sometimes...well, American Idol gives me a chance to live vicariously through other people who want the same thing I did, but who actually are willing to go out there and get it.  Or at least try.  So, this past season of American Idol, I watched every episode. There was this guy I thought was amazing - his name was Marque Lynch.  He was on the Mickey Mouse Club with Britney, Justin, et.al., but he hasn't made it yet.  I loved him. He was a really great singer, an amazing dancer - and really good looking.  But, Simon didn't love him.  He cut him, at the wild card show, with a "you aren't meant for this competition."  He told him he should be on Broadway.  Well, Marque Lynch IS on broadway - or at least, OFF broadway.  I went to see Fame, the Musical last night, and there he was!  The whole performance it was bugging me - I kept thinking that the dude looked like the guy I loved from American Idol. But, I kept telling myself that my eyes were deceiving me.  Actually, what I thought was - "Meg you are a horrible person - you think all black people look alike."  I really was thinking that.  I didn't think it could possibly be him, so I thought I was just being stupidly racist - (doing the thing that white people do to African Americans - "You look just like Eddie Murphy!"  when who ever it is looks NOTHING like him).  BUT!!!  I was RIGHT!  At the end of the show, when the lights came up, I read my playbill and there he was! Marque Lynch! From American Idol!  It was pretty fun.    I guess Simon was right - he was made for Off Broadway!

      That's why I'm really sad that MK has anorexia.  Clearly, no one will be very surprised at the news.  I, for one, was relieved that she decided to get help instead of denying the fact that she was freakishly skinny.  And, isn't it ironic that she made fun of all the eating disorder rumors by playing a journalist on SNL and yelling out, to herself, "Eat a sandwich!?"  Eating disorders always wig me out a little. Have these people lost their minds?  Food is so GOOD!  Yum.  The fact that anyone would give it up completly is so weird to me.    A few years ago, I went on a low carb diet and lost a bunch of weight.  It was the first time in my life that I understood a little of what it feels like to have an eating disorder.  I would look at my self, getting thinner by the day, and I would only get more obsessed with losing the weight.  My mind was clouded - I never once thought I was thin, I always thought I was still fat.  Looking back on it, it is a little scary. I guess I was lucky that I got over it when I did.  Of course, I was no where CLOSE to being dangerously skinny - but, I understood the mentality a little better.  People say that eating disorders are more about the need to control your life than the need to be skinny. Maybe that was the problem - MK had TOO much control over everything, and never learned know how to have fun and let go.  I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist. But, I am happy that she is taking care of herself.  I hope she comes out of this a better, fatter Olsen.

      He really is.  I have his CD on my Ipod, and the lyrics are really good.  I don't quite understand how my parents produced such a talented person.  A sampling...  "I'm locked inside a chamber, of hope and depravation Fighting in endless circles, in the name of creation Your face was effervescent, only in masked elation Atlanta feeds the hunger, for secret escalation  Chicaghost  Starving for clouds above, even the words were breathing Follow into the country, I am the only leading Highways are only vacant preparing your collision Return into the city, it was your own decision  Chicaghost"  How does he come up with this stuff?  www.chasepattison.com, www.bigteaseband.com

      Friday night, George and I really, really wanted to see a movie. Our first two choices, Napeoleon Dynamite and Super Size Me, were sold out.  So, due to our intense desire to see a movie, we decided on The Day After Tomorrow.  (It was the only thing that wasn't sold out).  After about 15 minutes, I already knew that this movie was going to forever hold a place in Meg's Top 10 Worst Movies Ever.  And, I almost always like the movie I'm seeing - I'm not picky.  This movie...Bad News.  Quit reading if you think you might actually go see this movie someday...  The movie opens with this scientist, Dennis Quaid, briefing a bunch of politicians about the crisis of global warming.  Apparently, if we don't stop global warming, we will be pushed into an Ice Age and most of North America will turn into a frozen tundra.  And, this, apparently, will happen in the next 100 to 1000 years.  However, it doesn't happen in 100-1000 years, but it happens in the next 24 hours. What a coincidence.  So, we must watch as the world experiences crazy weather phenomonens, and ultimately, freezes.  Men freeze to death as soon as the cold air hits them.  But, not only do we have to deal with the elements, but there is a pack of hungry wolves on the loose, a deadly case of blood poisoning that must be cured, and a situation where one person has to sacrifice himself to save the others.  But, of course, we can't just have a crazy premise with awesome special effects. We have to have a story.  A father who doesn't treat his son right, who realizes that his son might die, and who braves all to go rescue him. A son who has a high school crush on this girl, who is willing to risk his life not once, not twice, but THREE times to save her.  A mother who is so selfless, she sacrifices herself to read a story to a little boy who is about to die from cancer.  It is just so farfetched. And, the dialogue...have you seen Titanic? This is about 1,000 times worse.    Plus, the blatant political overtones...I mean, they might as well have cast George Bush and Dick Cheney in the roles of the president and vice-president.  The entire theater laughed when they saw them, because, no matter what you think of those dudes, it's pretty ridiculous when a movie is that blatantly political.    Finally, of course, all of the lead characters, amazingly, live.  Half the population of the US dies, but don't worry - the father and son will have their touching reunion, the mother and father will be able to tell each other "I love you" when it's over. And, most importantly, the son and his girl get to kiss and have a future together. How sweet.   Bottom line, this movie is in my bottom 10 of all time - no contest. Right along with From Justin to Kelly.

      And...you end up in Coney Island!  Today, my husband and I took a little day trip out to Coney Island.  You've heard of it. You may have seen it before in movies or on TV. Let me tell you - it is NOTHING like what you've seen.  It is the butthole of the earth.  Or at least, of New York City.  First, when you get off the train and look around, there is nothing but fast food and rednecks.  I saw a Church's Chicken, about three McDonalds, a Subway, and a Popeyes.  Yum...barf.  There is a restaurant called Nathan's, which is basically a sidewalk hot dog vendor in fancy packaging. It screams "The Original #1 All Beef Hot Dog," but what it means is the Original Nasty, Greasy, Salty, All Beef Heart attack.  But, George and I heard that Nathan's was the place to go - so we ordered two hotdogs, one plain, one with chili and cheese, and took a bite.  The outside casing of the dog was super thick, it crunched.  Puke.  Then, we made our way to the Boardwalk.  You've heard the romantic songs - Under the Boardwalk, we'll be falling in love..."  There ain't gonna be NO fallin in love under that nasty boardwalk.  There is a beach, but on the other side, there are some more fast food joints, a few snack vendors, a "Dunk the Creep" booth and a "Shoot the Freak" gallery.  Please.  Furthermore - there are people PLAYING these games and EATING this food!  I couldn't believe it.  And...the beach...well, plenty of huge (and women) men in speedos smoking their cigarettes and watching their kids beat each other up.  Nice.  Oh, the PEOPLE. I couldn't decide if they were tourists, or people who actually lived within 10 miles of Manhattan.  I thought - it couldn't possibly be the latter, no way - but, I was wrong. Turns out, there are several sections of Queens and the Bronx that haven't really experienced what the real world looks like. To put it in perspective - George saw this huge guy, without his shirt on, bend over, grab his man boobs, and exclaim..."Hey! I've got Teets!"  If that isn't redneck, I don't know what is.  One bright spot to Coney Island is the aquarium.  We decided to check it out, and thankfully, spent most of the day in there. I love aquariums.    On the way home, we saw two girls, not together, in the same subway car with giant, thick, gold, "Chanel" hoops in their ears and rhinestone belts reading "Jackie."  Two.  I don't know if they were both named Jackie, or if they have a thing for Jackie O.  I hope it's the former, because I am pretty darn sure that Jackie O would never have worn a rhinestone belt with her name on it...  So, next time you see a movie that glorifies Coney Island...fuhgeddaboutit.

      I'm sorry, but this Kabalah stuff has gotten out of control.    Madonna officially wants to be called Esther.  Why? Because she wants to "disassociate herself from the negative energy surrounding her mother's name."  OH MY GOSH.  What is that? Negative energy surrounding your mother's name? And because she died of cancer?  Forget the fact that Madonna has, for decades, embodied the word "controversial." Forget the fact that she was one of the first people ever to have a video not just relegated to late night, but BANNED from MTV. Forget the fact that she had her first child with a man she didn't love simply because he had good "breeding genes."  Forget that she published a book of nude photographs called "Sex." And forget, most importantly, that her current tour has been labeled one of the trashiest, most controversial, and sexually explicit shows ever.    Just remember - the name "Madonna" has negative energy because her mother had the name, and she died of cancer. Esther, I hate to break it to ya, but you are going to die someday.  And probably from cancer.  A lot of people do. It's part of life.  Especially if you have a family history - despite the fact that you change your name to disassociate from that history.   This is one of those stories that makes me realize how totally lame it is to worship, follow, and obsess about celebrities.  They are idiots.  Complete and total idiots.  Or at least, Esther is.  And Esther isn't even a cool Jewish name.

      So, the entire world can now watch Sex and the City. That makes me happy for two reasons.  First, Sex and the City is a great show. Everyone knows that.  Second, I can finally watch it without flinching so much.  Although I love the show, the over-the-top cussing and graphic sexual descriptions (and activities, for that matter) are a little much for me sometimes.    But, it also scares me.  Why? Because, Carrie Bradshaw (and the rest of the gang) are not real New Yorkers.  Of course, there are the privileged few in New York who are sort of like them. They get invited to restaurant, club, and art gallery openings, are on the A list at parties, and are asked to sponsor/judge/endorse products and events.  But, they are PRIVILEGED. They are NOT normal.  Remember when I talked about the "Beautiful People?"  Well, most of those people are beautiful - but BROKE. They try to be like Carrie Bradshaw by buying too expensive bags, shoes, and clothes.  By going to eat at the trendiest (and most expensive) restaurants. By going out to the fanciest clubs (even if they aren't on the "get in free" guest list).  Also, I am willing to bet that a lot of New York women are sad as well.  They have this impression of who a true New Yorker is supposed to be - an insider, with the most fashionable style, who has this sense of sexual freedom with no regrets.  But, deep down, do we really think they are happy?    One of the great things about Carrie Bradshaw is her confidence.  But, I haven't met a sex-and-the-city-wannabe New Yorker who has that same confidence.  Remember - Carrie is a character, not a real person. And I am willing to bet that if you tried to be like her, your life won't be as smooth and carefree as hers seems to be.  So, for you new Sex And The City fans, enjoy the show for its entertainment value.  But, don't get caught up in Carrie's fabulous life, because in reality, I'm not really sure it exists.

      Hanson RULES.  I know what you are thinking - those little dudes who sang that incredibly annoying song that I could never get out of my head??  Yes. Those dudes.  They totally rule, and it is about time the whole world recognized it.  I was embarassed to buy their second CD, This Time Around. But, when I bought it - I was so happy. I listened to it all the time. The music was excellent, and the lyrics were insightful.  The Hanson boys were growing up.  Now, they have released another studio album, called Underneath.  I have both the acoustic and studio versions on my Ipod.  When a song from the album comes on, for a second, I don't realize who it is. I just smile because the song is so great. Then, when I realize it is Hanson...well, I want to run home and post on my blog that they RULE and everyone should buy their CDs.  Hanson RULES.

      Today, I got really annoyed at a group of tourists.    Most of the time, I enjoy the tourists.  It is fun to see people reacting to New York City.  They are so excited, so amazed, so in awe of everything around them.  They gasp when they see the advertisements of Times Square, cry at Ground Zero, sigh when they take the boat trip to the Statue of Liberty, and laugh at the crazy looking New Yorkers in the Village.  It's refreshing.  Most of the time.  But, today...it was annoying.  A huge group of tourists stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, got out their map, and tried to find Macy's.  And Macy's was right in front of them. This was at 1:00, right during the lunch rush, in one of the busiest intersections in the city.  I, of course, ran into them, almost fell down, and had to pretty much shove them in order to get past the horde and on my way. Ugh.    So, a word of advice to tourists.  Get your butts out of the middle of the sidewalk when surveying your maps. That way, I can continue to be a tourist-friendly New Yorker.

      I used to be obsessed with reading the book before I saw the movie.  I read Jurassic Park first. I read The Firm first. I read the Cider House Rules first - and many, many others.  Guess what - I didn't like any of the movies.  I love to read.  Many of the books I read I finish in one day.  I get excited about the characters, their lives, where they've been, where they might go in the future.  I speculate about how a particular series will end.  I think about the characters, dwell on them, talk about them, come up with theories, stories, situations in my mind for them to get into.  I enjoy the whole reading, digesting, and discussing process. I love to read.  I am also a movie person. I LOVE to go see movies - I go by myself in the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday just because I can. I love cheesy teen movies. I love art house flicks. I love romantic comedys, hard core cry fest dramas, action movies, musicals, and even documentaries.  I love them all - it is a rare case where I see a movie in which I can't find a single redeeming quality. I am a movie person.  So, when I hear that a book is being made into a movie, I am tempted to run to the bookstore, buy the book, read it, then run and see the movie the day it opens.  I have done that many times.  But, I have always been disappointed.  A few months ago, I read an article by Roger Ebert, my go to movie critic.  He never reads the book first - his theory is that if you read the book first, you can't possibly enjoy the movie. But, if you see the movie first, you will learn to appreciate the book even more than if you never saw the movie.    The standard argument against seeing the movie first is that you will incorporate the movie characters into the book, and the story won't be as authentic.  I disagree.  If the book really is a great one, worth reading, the book will stand on its own.  If the book characters should be different than the movie characters, the book will lead you there.  A really good book won't allow itself to be limited by its companion movie's characters, scenery, music, and plot.  It will still be a great book.  So, try it.  Go see the movie, then read the book.  I bet that you will be pleasantly surprised.  You might actually LIKE a movie that was based on a great book for a change.

      http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,122307,00.html  I'm a big believer in praying, listening to God, and following God's will.  But, this seems a little ridiculous. Didn't Jesus say that all food on the earth has been made clean?  Not just the nuts, berries, and fruit from the Garden of Eden?    Dieting is out of control.  I'll admit - I have been a slave to the diets for years now. And I still am. But, I am convinced that only one thing really works.  Eat less, exercise more. It's simple really.  So, that's my plan.  I think God would definitely approve.

      Remember this old joke?  You say:  "I LOVE pizza."  And your friend smugly says back: "Then why don't you marry it?" And laughs, and laughs.  My friends and I used to talk about making a person out of pizza and putting a radio in their head so it could say "I Do."  We really meant it too - we must have loved pizza back then...  But - I must say - I feel that way about my Ipod. I love it so much, I want to marry it.   The think I have missed most about New York has been my car radio.  Just putting on the radio, and singing at the top of my lungs. With the Ipod, I can get half of that - the listening part, not the singing part, of course.    The only problem is - occasionally I do start singing at the top of my lungs. Then I feel silly. But, THEN, I remember that this is New York - I don't look any sillier than all the other people singing at the top of their lungs!  The joys of the Ipod.  Ahhh...

      That's me tonight. A big, giant, Biatch.  I can't seem to get in a good mood.  Everything that anyone says or does makes me mad.  I don't know what is wrong with me.    I mean, I came home in a great mood. I went to the store, bought stuff to make Tacos...was so excited about cooking dinner and staying at home tonight.  But, once I got here, I just got annoyed and irritated and haven't gotten over it.  I keep yelling at people, getting annoyed with anything anyone says to me.  I am a horrible person.  Maybe I need to eat some cake or something. That would help, I'm sure.

What do you think? A bunch of B.S., or the truth?    I was just getting to like this couple.  But, I'm not too upset. Now, break up JLo and Marc, and I will be in tears.    Justin - why don't you go over to Europe and clean up Brit's image for her? The poor girl is clueless.

      Idina Menzel just won the Tony for Lead Actress in a Musical, for Wicked.  She is beautiful, even with green makeup.  I am really, really happy. Especially since Wicked is such a great musical - I am beginning to become obsessed with it. What a voice!  I think I have a little crush on her.  And, she has a super-hot husband - Taye Diggs anyone?  Hugh Jackman just won for best lead actor in a musical!  If you come to New York anytime in the next few months, get a ticket to see The Boy From Oz.  It is amazing to see someone you know from the movies tear it up like a broadway veteran. He IS the role of Peter Allen, and rumor has it that the show will close when his run is over.  No one could replace Hugh.  Oh my - Avenue Q wins!  I am excited!!!  Okay, gotta go to bed.

      My sister-in-law got married today. It was beautiful - wonderful ceremony, beautiful reception on a boat cruise around the island, and excellent after-party at a bar in the East Village.    New Yorkers know how to get married right.    And this explains why I have been MIA for the past 4 days.  But - no more bridesmaid duty in the forseeable future! I need a break - but, I'm sure I will be super excited to do it again someday!  Any takers?

      I am so sad about this.  I don't know why. I guess it makes me sad because he lived to be so old - 93 - and his wife lived the entire time as well...and he wasn't able to enjoy it. And neither was she.  I have been sad about the Reagan's situation for a long time.  When I saw the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"  I thought of Alzheimers and how horrible it must be. Not only it is horrible for the friends and family of the person afflicted, but how horrible it must be for the person. Think of how awful it was to watch Jim Carrey's character lose his memories one at a time, in reverse order.  It was just heartwrenching.    Let's all say a word of prayer for Nancy Reagan.  I can't imagine what she is going through, but even more so, what she has been through over the past 10 years.

      I don't normally hang with the "beautiful people." Don't get me wrong - all my friends are beautiful. But, you know what I mean by "beautiful people."  Those size 2, 5'10", super fabulous women (and men) who frequent the hot restaurants, lounges and clubs...who always know the bouncer...who are always on the list...those "beautiful people."  Tonight - I hung with the "beautiful people."   First, my parents, George and I went to eat at the Spice Market.  You've heard of it.  Turn to the "hot sheet" in US Weekly and read all about it.  The "beautiful people" love it. Jennifer & Brad have been there. As have Demi and Ashton. To put it in perspective for you, I called almost 2 months ago to make the reservation.  They only had tables at 6 (super early in New York) and 10 (pretty darn late, even for New York). TWO months BEFORE!  I must say - the food - it was one of my top 5 meals of all time. And the space - amazing. I can understand why it is so trend-i-fied - AND why it is full of "beautiful people."  Second, my family then spent the next half hour or so walking around the Meat Packing district in New York.  That is where Pastis, Lotus, and Stella McCartney all are.  Tons of "beautiful people" walking around in their high heels and fabulous outfits.  And, tons of trendy bars and lounges, where the "beautiful people" were eating outside and smoking their cigarettes.  Third, I went to Bob and Margaret's pre-day-before-the-wedding party.  I was expecting a low key hotel lounge. That it was not.  There was a list, a mean bouncer, and, even after we made it past the first bouncer, we had to haggle with two OTHER bouncers to get upstairs.  When we got up there, again, "beautiful people" everywhere I looked.  I must admit, the last time I hung with the "beautiful people," I was with a group of great friends, none of whom are "beautiful people,"  (although all are beautiful), but all of whom know how to have a good time.  It was a blast. We zoomed past the bouncer, and had a heyday at the club.  And we all looked, and felt, beautiful.  It's not as much fun to hang with the "beautiful people" without a down to earth group of friends to hang with you. The more you are around them, the less beautiful you feel.  Thank goodness I have my friends who make me feel  truly  beautiful.

      So...I've heard today THREE times that Justin is in talks to star as the lead in a movie adaptation of the musical Rent.  WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!  I don't want to get too excited. This news came out a couple of years ago as well - Spike Lee bought the rights, wanted to cast Justin as the lead - blah, blah, blah. I got really worked up about it, was counting the days.  What happened?  A big Nothing.  This might be a whole bunch of nothing again.  But, think of the possibilities if it were something?!?!  I might die.  Not only is Rent my favorite musical of all time - I cry every single time, but Justin Timberlake is the hottest thing on the earth (next to my husband).    Rent + Justin = Meg's Heaven.  If that were to come out, I could die happy.

      DELL CAN SUCK EM.  So, I have more to my Dell story.&nbsp; You guys aren't going to believe this.   So, they finally ship me back my computer.&nbsp; Except - they ship it to my BROTHER'S APARTMENT.&nbsp; AND...it says "Final Notice," though Chase has never seen any other notices at his apartment.&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; So, I call Dell - they say that they can change the address, but it will take another 3 days to get it to me.&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; So, I say I'll pick it up.  They tell me the place is at 39th and 11th Ave. After part 1 of the bar, I head over there. There is no Airborne Express anywhere.&nbsp; And, I am looking for it in the pouring down rain.&nbsp; George calls them, and they say that they will ship it again to my brother's apartment after 7 PM that night. I call Chase, my brother, and he does me a favor by heading home.&nbsp; He cancels his plans to do that for me. Nice brother.&nbsp; He sits at home.&nbsp; Guess what! THEY DON"T SHOW UP.  We call them back, and they of course have no idea what happened. So, I tell them again that I will pick it up after the bar exam.&nbsp; I go to the place - it is on 12th Avenue, not 11th - and I spend 20 minutes wandering through this huge warehouse trying to find the "front desk."&nbsp; I find it...and I'm so excited. Finally, I have my computer.  So...I get home...open the box...there is NO POWER CORD.&nbsp; Guys.&nbsp; They forgot to give it back to me! AGAIN!&nbsp; And there is a note in there telling me to "call technical support" about my power cord.&nbsp; HOLY CRAP.&nbsp; I had to wait on the effin phone AGAIN for 30 minutes!&nbsp; AND - he almost didn't help me becuase I didn't know my brother's phone number! See, they changed the name on the whole account instead of just delivering it to him.&nbsp; That makes sense, doesn't it?&nbsp; So...in 20 minutes, my battery will be dead, and I won't beable to blog or check email for another THREE days!&nbsp; I HATE THEM. SERIOUSLY.&nbsp; HATE.&nbsp; COULD NOT BE WORSE.

But Badu's rep denies that Puma is named for the athletic shoe. "Erykah is more down to earth than that," says the rep. "It's more likely that the name has meaning."   Um. Yeah. I'm sure it has a lot of meaning.&nbsp; And even if it did, still a really stupid name. Ugh.

       So far, I have lived in New York one year and 2 months, and I have seen:  Keri Russell, John Mayer, Drew Barrymore, Fabrizio Moretti, Taylor Hanson, Yoko Ono, Dennis Rodman, Gisele, Selma Blair, Daniel Stern, Daniel Day Lewis, David Moscow, Jesse the MTV VJ, Bryan McFadden, Iggy Pop, Christina Ricci, Her boyfriend - the guy who played Chandler's roommate Eddie, the guy from the movie Bring It On, Spike Lee, Shandi from Top Model, Katrina from The Apprentice.&nbsp;That is all I can think of right now...  My brother - here for 1 week - saw LEONARDO DICAPRIO.&nbsp; I think, with that one sighting, he wins.  My cousin in DESTIN saw Matthew McConaughey (sp) and Penelope Cruise at the new Destin Starbucks at about 9 in the morning.&nbsp; With that one sighting, she beats me too. And in DESTIN, no less.  What's up with THAT? I, apparently, am a B-lister.&nbsp; Drew Barrymore is the only sighting I have that comes close to theirs.&nbsp; Whatever.

      Hello my homies!&nbsp; ;)   I am oh, so sorry that I left you all alone the past 3 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;But...I do have a pretty good excuse.&nbsp;  In case you don't know, my computer is broken.&nbsp; Let me tell you the story...   About 3 days before my first final of my last semester ever as a student, my computer screen started to act up.&nbsp; Of course, it totally freaked me out - I needed my computer to take my finals!&nbsp; So, I proceeded to call Dell.   To set up the story, let me describe this to you.&nbsp; My screen looked how you might picture a screen to look after you drop your computer.&nbsp; There were green and red lines spreading all across the screen, clearly NOT a software problem. It was functioning perfectly other than that. Oh, and it didn't happen all the time. If I PRESSED ON THE SCREEN, the problem went away.   So, I call Dell.&nbsp; 45 minutes later, I am talking to one of their "representatives."&nbsp; After repeating my service tag about 3 times - she couldn't understand my clear, southern accent (or maybe my ENGLISH). She proceeded to take me through the usual B.S.&nbsp; "Turn off your computer." "Restart." Nope. That didn't work.&nbsp; "Hmmm...go to controls, system settings, and change the pixels on your screen."&nbsp; Um. No.&nbsp; Then, of course, after a few more rounds of "check this" and "update that," she told me to reformat my hard drive.&nbsp; Um...I don't think so.&nbsp; So, I did what every reasonable person would do - I told her..."Listen.&nbsp; I know all about computers. I have had a million of them. And I am 100% certin after I reformat my hard drive, I will STILL have wavy lines on the screen. These lines go away when I PRESS ON THE SCREEN - CLEARLY A HARDWARE PROBLEM"&nbsp; She said..."Um, I don't know.&nbsp; Call back the next time it happens, and we will try to update some more things."&nbsp;   Irate, I hung up the phone. About a week later, it happened - of course - again.&nbsp; I, again, called Dell.&nbsp; I waited for 25 minutes, then got CUT OFF.&nbsp; I called back. I waited for 30 minutes - when someone answered, it was the WRONG DEPARTMENT.&nbsp; I told him - listen - just transfer me to someone directly - I know you can do that.&nbsp; He said he would. 25 minutes later, I get cut off again.&nbsp; So - it has been an hour and 20 minutes at this point.&nbsp; I call one more time.&nbsp; 20 minutes later, I get a person - who, of course, I can barely understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell her the problem. She says, "Restart your computer."&nbsp; BULL SH*T.&nbsp; I say, "Look. I have been through this. It is a hardware problem."&nbsp; She says, "Sounds like it, but the system is down, and I can't look up your warranty information right now." WHAT???? Again, I am IRATE.&nbsp; I say to her, in a nice loud voice..."I have been on the phone for almost TWO hours and the best you can do is say your SYSTEM is DOWN???&nbsp; PUT A NOTICE ON YOUR STUPID RECORDING SO PEOPLE DON"T SPEND THEIR WHOLE NIGHT ON THE PHONE WITH YOU JACKASSES WHO CAN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH!"&nbsp; (Well, I didn't say that last part).&nbsp;&nbsp; She says, "I am so sorry - give me your number and I'll call you back tomorrow."&nbsp;   At 3:30 AM, I am tucked in bed, asleep, and my phone rings.&nbsp; I, of course, am confused and disoriented.&nbsp; I don't get to the phone in time to answer it.&nbsp; It's DELL.&nbsp; At 3 FREAKIN 30 AM!&nbsp; And...You guessed it...she didn't leave a message with her extension. AND...she never called back.&nbsp; THE NERVE.&nbsp; Again...IRATE.   Keep in mind that my warranty runs out August 1st.&nbsp; So, I have to get this taken care of.&nbsp; You better believe that the thought has crossed my mind that they intentionally doing this to me.&nbsp; DAMN the DELL jackasses.&nbsp;   I call back a few days later.&nbsp; At 6:00 AM.&nbsp; My wait was only about 15 minutes this time.&nbsp; I didn't waste any time. I said, immediately, "My computer is broken. I have talked to you all three times about this.&nbsp; I want a box delivered today.&nbsp; My LCD screen is broken."&nbsp; He said, of course.&nbsp; Took my address.&nbsp; The box arrived 2 days later - delivered to my husband's work as we agreed.&nbsp; I shipped the computer.   A week later, the computer arrives in KNOXVILLE at my PARENT'S HOUSE!&nbsp; When I bought the computer 3 years ago, I used their address. I have since moved 4 times.&nbsp; I have told Dell my new addresses every time I have moved.&nbsp; I even told Dell just the week before to ship to my husband's work. Yet, they STILL HAVE MY PARENT'S address on file!&nbsp; IRATE.&nbsp; My parents, being the sweet, kind, generous people that they are, send me the computer overnight so I can have it to post in my blog. (The only thing my comptuer is used for...).&nbsp; It arrives, and I open it up.   GET THIS.&nbsp; THE SCREEN IS STILL BROKEN.&nbsp; STILL BROKEN.&nbsp; THE JACKASSES DID NOT FIX IT. LAZY SONS OF BITCHES!&nbsp; They did, however, fix a tiny broken piece on the base.&nbsp; A piece that did not affect my computer's performance at all. Not even a tiny smidgeon.&nbsp; I HATE THEM.   So, I call. 30 minutes later, the woman says: "They turned it on and didn't see a problem with the screen, so they just sent it back."&nbsp; I calmly YELLED, "LADY - I TOLD YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS - FIX IT!"&nbsp; Guys - they are so shady.&nbsp; She said, "I'm really sorry, I'll send another box."&nbsp;   Then, we had a family emergency, and I had to go home to Tennessee for a week.&nbsp; I called Dell - waited - then asked them to change the shipment location to my brother's work in New York.&nbsp; He carried my computer to his work - but, guess what - THEY SHIPPED TO MY HUSBAND'S WORK INSTEAD.&nbsp; I found that out&nbsp; yesterday when my husband went back to work.&nbsp;   So, my computer is back at Dell. I am posting from school where I have been holed up studying for the bar exam.&nbsp; But, a few people have asked me about the status of my blog. It is active...but, just taking a little break right now.&nbsp; I do need a distraction, though.&nbsp; So...maybe you will see a little bit more of me in the next few days.&nbsp;   So, the moral of the story is - BUY ANYTHING BUT DELL.

      But, Go Vols.   urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1848672   This is totally crazy! I don't even know what is going on, but I think this is hilarious. I'm sure we are being sued for Alabama's nice long streak of so-so to bad seasons, which we  clearly  are responsible for, and so Fulmer better watch his back. Sic a die-hard Tide fan jury on him, he's got ZERO chance for a fair trial. (But...sic a die hard Vol fan jury on him...Alabama's got no chance).  I can't wait to see how this all turns out. Funny stuff. I will say, if Fulmer broke some law, let him suffer the consequences. But, I am willing to bet that this is a really bad case of sour grapes more than anything else. We'll see I guess.  (Oh, and when I use spell check, it wants to replace Fulmer with FLAMER...hehe).

       urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5485024/   I am scared of Alzheimer's Disease. Scared that one of my parents will get it, scared that I will get it myself. It is such a horrible disease, and it makes me so happy that they may have found something to help it.  I would STRONGLY recommend that everyone watch the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. First of all, it is the best performance I have seen out of Jim Carrey (and I've seen Man on the Moon). Secondly, it is a touching, amazing, and scary look into what it might feel like to actually have Alzheimer's Disease.  We are so used to thinking of people like Nancy Reagan, thinking of her trials and what she went through watching her husband disappear before her eyes. But, have you ever thought of what it must be like for the person who is slipping away? They are losing their memories...year by year. They probably desperately want to hold on to them, but just can't. Watch the movie. It gives you a new perspective on the disease and makes you long to find a cure.  Great movie...One of my favorites for the year.

      I have to give the props for this.   urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1852299   Finally.  We have needed this for so long.  I can think of several games that have gone Tennessee's way because of a bad call, as well as many that we LOST because of stupid, BLIND coaches.  This, hopefully, will make everything more FAIR.  I hope it works.

       urlLink http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,14643,00.html?eol.tkr   This show is a disgrace.  I love me some reality TV. I am addicted to the Bachelor, Survivor, Real World, Road Rules, For Love or Money, etc. They are fun, harmless entertainment. No big deal.  But...Any show involving marriage makes me sick to my stomach. Marriage is important. It is sacred. It is not something to mess with. Mom-swapping, wife-swapping, attempts to break couples up...It really, really bothers me.  I hated Temptation Island. But, I figured that those couples must have some major problems to even sign up for that show. I must have been wrong - now we have so many shows marrying off people, pretending to marry off people, breaking up married couples, or trading spouses - it is terrible.  I am married. I love my husband. And I think that anyone who tries to break us up deserves to live a miserable, horrible life. It is wrong, just wrong. I would NEVER swap my George for some other stupid guy. I know that people cheat, people break up, marriages dissolve for all kinds of reasons. It happens. However, let's not encourage it unless it is absolutely needed. Let's not allow these networks to make money off of destroying marriages. People can do that all by themselves if they want to, but I don't think the American viewing public should support them.  BOYCOTT.

      But I hope this happens.  OSCAR HEAT: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 may be disqualified from this year's Oscars because Cuba's government aired the doc on state-run television, in violation of Academy rules that says a feature film can't air on the tube within nine months of its release.  Here's why.  Not because it isn't a great movie. Not because it isn't "daring" and "provocative." But, because it was created solely for the purpose of defeating a president, and I don't think it would be very fun for a piece of propoganda to win a best picture oscar.  It's more fun when things like Braveheart or Shindler's List win - movies that make a point, even if political, but aren't so obvious.  Just my opinion.  And, frankly, I'm rooting for New York Minute - MK and A can REALLY tear it up.

       urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/07/29/pageant.talent.ap/index.html   So, they are taking the talent competition out of the Miss American pagent.  This really bothers me.   It is supposed to be a legitimate scholarship program, providing a role model for young American women.  Cmon ABC - we all know that crazy talent is what makes a role model!  Although I always got bored during the talent competition and turned the channel, it is important to this show.  We all know that talent is the real reason that anyone becomes Miss America.  That, and nice T&amp;A.
