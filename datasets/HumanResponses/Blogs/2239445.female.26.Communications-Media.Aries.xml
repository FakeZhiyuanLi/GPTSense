      Yuan SMS me last night to tell me that she's extremly nervous for her driving test today. I reassured her that its going to be fine and just treat it as a normal practice. She should rest early so that she can stay alert today! Well! She MADE IT!! hahaha.....  Anyway, we should celebrate sometime this week! She should be more free since she need not go for driving lessons anymore! haha....

      Yoohoo!!! tomorrow is my birthday!!  Going to watch "Passion of Christ" tomorrow with my sister-in-law at Lido. Hope I dun cry out loud or else the whole cinema may just get flooded and maybe you can even see Noah inside the cinema saying "hi" to Jesus! ;P Getting older already... ... but nevermind, i just tell myself I am getting wiser by the days...

      Some things are fated to happen.  Some things are meant to happen.  Some things happen and leave deep impact in our lives. Some things happen and slipped out of our minds.  Some things happen too fast and we don't know how to react to them. Some things just seemed to drag on and on.  Some things have a beginning and an end. Some things have a beginning with no end.  Some things are meant for deep thoughts. But I am thinking of nothing at all.

      Today is Ivy's last day at Brandz. Went out Pasta Mania at Harbour Front for lunch just now with Doris, Mohd, Steven & Ivy. Till now I can feel the spinach tortellini swimming in my stomach..... arrgggh...... gonna meet Cassandra & Marion at Far East Square later to eat Sushi Tei with Ivy at 7pm later.... stomach gonna burst man!  Last night Xueling and I went to Tampines Mall to shop for Ivy's farewell present. Saw a very sweet-looking photo frame. Tat's what Mohd suggested. Later going to take pics with her and we are going to print the photo to different sizes ;)  Oh well, I sure hope Ivy is able to cope well with her work there at O&M.  The new gal came today. Her name is Sue (a malay) but the worse thing to happen to her is --- she slipped and fell down the stairs. Think her tail bone was hurt as she cannot manage to walk or sit properly. So she has to take a cab to SGH for a check up! Sigh.... wat rotten luck!

      The week has passed with many unusual meetings ;)  Yesterday evening, I met up with Yingyi at Bedok. It's been a looooooooong time since I last met her! She really changed a lot man! She's bigger but I'm glad she's still sticking with this bf of hers whom she has been dating for 6 years! Expect to hear wedding bells ringing soon!!!   Went to her house for dinner and was amazed to see the many statues of Buddha and Thai Gods in her house! 2 were along the corridor! Very big ones too! And her whole living room is packed with those statues!!! The most amazing that happened was seeing the milk dripping into a bowl in front of the statue (which Yingyi's bf claimed that because the God is present and is drinking the milk).   Its really good to see old friends again!!!!  By the way, "Passion of Christ" is really a bloody show man!!! At the end of the show, I started to question if its really true that Judas hanged himself near that rotting carcass. And also if the crow really came and pecked the convict's eye... But I cried at 2 scenes - The first was when Mary saw Jesus parading the town with the cross and falling down but she hesitated before rushing over to help him. I was thinking to myself "How could she have hesitated? He's her son!!! No matter wat happened she should just push herself forward to help him up! (Even the soldiers were to hit her! At least tats wat I would do to protect my child). The second scene was when Jesus finally died on the cross. All the sufferings had come to an end at last! Its really horrible! Come to think of it, our forefathers are really SADDISTS! To think that they can come up with such horrible ideas to torture people! Sigh.......  And on Sunday (18th April) , Yuanyuan, Xueling, Yanshan & I met up at Furama Hotel to have high tea at their cafe- Tiffany. The food is not too bad. But just felt slight tremors when people walk past us. After that we went to sing to our heart's content at K-ster in Lucky Chinatown. They finally updated their songlists!!! I saw Mayday's latest albums inside!! SO HAPPY! But didn't get a chance to sing any of their songs cos we only booked a 4-hour package. Xueling a bit mad about Jay Chou! Wanted to pose next to Jay in one of the MTVs but was not successful! haha... should do it at home lah!! Can pause the VCD mah! Alamak!   After that we went to Coffee Bean to have a drink. Time really flies when we were having a good time!

      Went to the library and borrowed 4 Chinese books on Saturday. Managed to complete 3/4 of the jigsaw puzzle Yuanyuan, Xueling & Yanshan bought for me on my birthday. How could my weekends be so uneventful? I didn't even switch on my stereo and sing! ARGH!! All thanks to April & Eunice who are studying for their exams on 9th May! BORING!!!! I thought I could BLAST my stereo and play all my favourite music because mum went to Kuala Lumpur with her senior citizen friends! Sianzzzzzzzzzzzz  Monday is a bit hard to pass by 'cos its the beginning of the week. Time suddenly seems to pass so s-l-o-w-l-y. Monday is an ultra boring day. Even the TV programmes are BORING. YAWNZZZZZZZZZZZZZz  Today is already Tuesday. Weather still a bit unbearable! WAS SWEATING PROFUSELY WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE SHOWER! YIKES! It got worse when I had to rush for the MRT!! I think the droplets of sweat must be SUPER big as I could feel them trickle down my face! ARGH! Lousy Weather!

      This site makes blogging so much easier nowadays. I remembered having lots of problems with the previous interface! WAY TO GO!  Anyway, today is an ultra BORING DAY! Its Friday! So what?? Do I give a damn? There's a Friday every week! so wat's going to make this one special? (Oh no! I sure am grouchy)  Got BOMBED by Stephanie last night! haha. This gal is getting married on 5th June! and I can see a BIG HOLE in my wallet now (think of the $$ to be spent of clothes, shoes, hairdo, makeup, perfume, bag?, ang pao money?)  Bought Mayday's Tian Kong Zhi Cheng DVD last night! Super anxious about the booklet that came with the DVD set! Very touching moments! Makes me want to get onto a time machine and go back to the day of the concert! Super HIGH man! It's like working out! haha... I was all wet and sticky after coming out from the concert! Mayday Rocks!!!! Mayday is simply SUPERB!

      Marion & I had lunch this afternoon at The Oriental. She's been complaining to me about our SNAKE KING with Royal Blood. After coming back from lunch, she SMS me and we started to gossip through our mobile phones.  I SMSed her I won't be surprised if the SNAKE KING actually fell asleep sitting in such an isolated corner in my department. She SMSed me back telling me that I should actually give him a scare to wake him up.  That's when I have 2 mischievious ideas.  First, I will BOO him whenever I go to the toilet.  Second, shall go and visit the hairdresser and collect hair from them. The next day, thou shalt spread the hair on his desk. He would think that he's going bald! That would give him a scare! How wicked right? Who cares?? :P  Or else he has to bear with my ROCK MUSIC that suddenly can go very LOUD! : )

      Time flies.   I wondered why time really flies after celebrating my 21st birthday.   How I wish I can travel back in time with a time-machine when I was still studying in poly. I should be enjoying my May/June holidays right now. And feeling real nervous as the results of the exams should be out soon!!! I would wonder how many distinctions can I score! Sigh... those good old days.  I had this feeling when I watched the Mayday Time Machine MTV DVD last night with my 2 nieces - April & Joanne. Joanne kept pestering me to watch Mayday DVD / VCD. As I was a bit 'early' home last evening, I decided to let them watch just one DVD.   I really admire these 5 guys who have a very good relationship with one another, and are so COOL in their music-making process! They write really meaningful lyrics and touching melodies. How I wish I could be like them. But first, I have to start picking up my guitar and try to strum something! haha... the guitar has been lying quietly in one corner of my bedroom collecting dust! OOps... How menacing of me to ill-treat my guitar that way! I've been praying day and night for my guitar and now that I've gotten it, I treat it like DIRT! I must really start to play again! Being BUSY is not an excuse! How did I find time to practice on my clarinet then? hmm.. humans... how complicated!  See how time flies? It's already 5.28PM!!! The sun is setting... Day's Out, Night's In.  Yawnzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  Why does time flies so fast even when I am entering dreamland?

      I can smell the stench in the still air. That's why Mohd & me slowed down our pace and let Doris & Indira walk in front of us as we were on the escalator at the Outram Park MRT Station.  I wondered if he ever bathed! This Singh! Argh... He stinks!!! Anyway, I felt as if the garbage truck just came!

      "Who am I? And how, I wonder, will this story end?"  "My life? It isn't easy to explain. It has not been the rip-roaring spectacular I fancied it would be, but neither have I burrowed around with the gophers. I suppose it has most resembled a bluechip stock : fairly stable, more ups than downs, and gradually trending upward over time. A good buy, a lucky buy, and I've learned that not everyone can say this about his life; of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me ad my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."  Read 2 chapters from the book "The Notebook" by Nicholas Sparks. Was really touched by the simplicity of this enduring love story between 2 North Carolina teens from very different backgrounds. Can't wait for the movie to be released!   Anyway, I must really thank Elaine & Joan from Mediaedge CIA for giving me the opportunity to work on this task and get to know this wonderful movie! I must really work hard for this opportunity to join the company!   Met up with Jeya last night for dinner and we were complaining about Brandz. Mohd has resigned. Now, its only left with me and Steven (the old gang are all gone - Ivy, Alex, Jacp, Jason) and right now, even Echo & Joyce are leaving......  Diana reminded us to go around looking for better job offers as things are getting more unstable here. Sigh... Easier said than done! It's pretty difficult to find a job now even though people are hiring. So sad...

      Yesterday was Hell. Until 7.45pm... ...  Elaine from MediaEdge called me when I was on the train on my way back. She offered me a job!!! A JOB as a media planner!!! I'm supposed to go down after work to sign my appointment letter! Thank you God! Thanks for sending sweet little angels to rescue me from HELL!  Think confusion will arise in future when there are 2 Elaines in the team! haha...  I quickly SMS Ivy, Mohd, Indira, Jeya and Cassandra to tell them the good news. Indira was on MC yesterday. She's got some viral infection. She's at work today but don't look so good.   Anyway, today is Echo and Joyce's last day. Will be giving them their presents at the end of the day. Hope they will like them ;)  Can't wait for the day to end!

      I felt as if I had just fallen from Heaven to Hell. The change is a bit drastic! A moment ago, it was really hot out there! Doris, Dawn and I had to trot down to MOE to attend a tender briefing (ultra boring,zzzzzz). Later, we were very determined to find out where Soul Food by Makansutra was so we asked for directions and finally found our way there! Settled for some desserts... and after that, had to walk in the hot sun back to the MRT station again! My GOD!! Why is the weather so unbearable nowadays?? ARgh......  Accepting this tender would mean BURNT WEEKENDS, and LATE NIGHTS! YIKES!!! How I dreaded such a lifestyle!!!! See?? Fallen from Heaven again!!! This time worse, even the 7th Level of HELL!  Last night I received a letter from Hong Kong ;) It's Sherry's belated Birthday wishes. Well, she sent me a box of chocolates with a Birthday Month Teddy Bear strap. Also, she gave me a bracelet with lots of four-leaf clovers! ; ) Hope that I have all the luck I need, man! There's still no news from MediaEdge CIA! Think they've given up hope on me! Sigh... I can't even stay in the 7th Level of Hell. Had to DOWNGRADE FURTHER!! Sob Sob..... and here I am, on the 18th Level of Hell!  I hope I dun fall any further!

      So sleepy now man.  Had a heavy lunch just now with Cassandra at New Harbour Cafe. This morning had breakfast around 9:30am with Cassandra at the coffeeshop behind our office. Oh dear. Think I'm going to gain the 2kg I shed for the past few months!!! YIKES!!!  Last night's dinner with the people at Mediaedge CIA was fun. Elaine suddenly popped a question - What's on Channel 5 at 10pm that night? and everyone started guessing for the answer. In the end Bertilla asked one question - What's on the front cover of the Straits Times on that day? As we were cracking our heads, Lisa even called the sales person from MediaCorp to ask what's on Channel 5 at 10pm!!! HAHA... the sales person din't even know the answer himself and asked if its something URGENT! haha.. must have scared the shit out of him! :P  Anyway, Bertilla had all the answers as she had a copy of Straits Times in her bag. :P She jokingly told me I failed my Entrance test! :P haha.... saw lots of people there and then. 2 people would be leaving - Claris and Catherine. Heard that Catherine is going to Universal McCann but she'll be off to Hong Kong for a short trip first.   Well, I've got lots of newspapers to clear since my last day is just next Friday! Time flies... As I was walking to the office this morning, the path that I've been taking for the past 1.5 years seems so familiar yet foreign! It seems like yesterday I've just joined the company! There's lots of things I missed out in the past. I never had breakfast with my colleagues before. Until recently where I had breakfast twice with Cassandra. I never really explored other eateries around my office either... Anyway, I'll miss this place. I mean the environment and my nice colleagues. Though I very much hated to say that Shenton Way offices are very COLD and BORING to me, I must admit that Brandz is no longer a conducive environment for me as I have no career growth here.  Wishing me all the best man!

      Went to attend Stephanie's wedding on 5th June (Sat). Yuanyuan, Xueling and I arranged to wear PINK on that day.   When we went to Hyatt, we saw that there were many other functions going on. We found our way to Hibiscus ballroom and the gals behind the reception counter asked us if we were from M1? Haha... We answered in sync "No, we are from Singtel." Think these lady just got a shock and later she still asked us if we were from Singtel! HOHOHO. We were arranged to sit at Table 7 with Audrey, Aloysius and her JC friends. Luckily it wasn't that awkward to speak to Audrey. We didn't have good experiences with her back in our Secondary School days.  I can still remember vividly what happened when we were in Secondary 3 and were tasked to do a Newspaper Project during the holidays for our English Language teacher. It turned out to be a mess because Audrey rejected all our ideas and did the newspaper on her own, following her mum's comments that newspapers should be serious! We were so MAD at her then, but anyway, that's already in the past. I'm glad she changed for the better. Yuanyuan got her HP number so we can arrange to meet up with her again to catch up with her the next time we meet Stephanie.  That's the longest wedding function I've ever attended. Guess what? The last dish - Green Tea Pudding only came around 10:45pm. By the time I reached home, its nearly 12.20am! Yawnz..... U should see how tired Xueling was! ;)  Going to meet up with Xueling, Yuanyuan and Yanshan this Saturday to celebrate Xueling's belated birthday. Haha.... must quickly find all the different languages to the number  26!

      In another 3 1/2 hours and I will no longer be an employee of Brandz Integrated Pte Ltd.  In another 3 hours and I will no longer be an employee of Brandz Integrated Pte Ltd..  In another 2 1/2 hours and I will no longer be an employee of Brandz Integrated Pte Ltd.  Isn't that WONDERFUL?

      Holy Shit!  I think my throat is getting a bit sore... HELP! I don't want to fall sick now!   Last night when I walked past the block of flats, I was so sad "Pirate" is no longer there. He used to sit majestically on the window sill, one eye fixed in a gaze out there, waiting for something to happen. But lately, he wasn't at his usual place. Sigh.... Pirate! Where are you?   Dunno why I always felt a bit better whenever I see Pirate. Too bad I can't keep pets, Pirate. Or else I will sure keep you as my companion, helping you sail across storms and fight against "Three Blind Mice".  Think I better go and see a doctor tonight. At the same time, I must get some medication ready for my Ho Chi Minh trip.  Was very pleased with myself last night as I found time to watch some Mayday MTVs with Joanne and April. They've been bugging me for nights!  Also, I managed to spend 1 and a half hours to practice my guitar. Progress is good. Hopefully I can spend some time with it tonight again.  Yesterday Ronnie's workers came to paint the house. Not very well-done I must say. Lousy Work! Didn't even finish the painting works yet. Everything's in a mess! Mummy kept complaining about the colours, how they misplaced the broom, how smelly the place was, how late the painters came! Aiyoh! Headache ah......  Saw the Mayday forum yesterday that their OST for Love of May is out. Couldn't find it though when I was at Tampines Mall yesterday evening to visit Times to buy my magazine. So sad, can't even find any WALLPAPER on the shelves! Sianzzzz.... must I really make&nbsp;a trip to Orchard to buy my magazine and CD? Yawnzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  &nbsp;

      Baga! &nbsp; Life is already full of complications and dilemnas. Why do we still have to go bonkers with trivial things like to upgrade or not to upgrade my handphone? ARGH!  &nbsp; Has been thinking of upgrading my Nokia 7250 to a Nokia 6230 before its launched. Now I felt like upgrading it to either a Sony Ericsson K700i (looks very classic and can take very nice pics! 41Mb memory space some more!), or the Nokia 7610 (so stylish!) or maybe the new Panasonic X300! oh no!!!! Why are consumers so spoilt for choices? &nbsp; I think I have a lot of phelgm stuck in my throat after eating that curry chicken and hot crab stick from the muslim stall just now. The orange juice may just aggravate the situation! ARGH! Today morning I could feel something strange going on in my throat. GOD! Please don't let me fall sick now!??!?!?!?!? All my family members are down with the bloody flu virus! The most badly affected happens to be Joanne who keeps vomitting and coughing non-stop. I hope she gets well soon! If not this is going to lead to a bad asthma attack! &nbsp; I was strumming my guitar last night again finally! I've been lacking discipline to do that for months! Luckily my fingers have not gone stiff! haha... Anyway, I hope to spend more time tonight to strum my guitar again tonight, hopefully I can find time to do so. Can practically just doze off while watching TV. Dunno why I'm feeling so tired.... &nbsp; STUPID Ronnie didn't keep his promise to do renovation work yesterday. This is really the pits! I think I am going to blow flames onto his face the next time I see him! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR..... if a tiger dun show its might they'll think its just a sick cat *loosely translated from the Chinese proverb :P &nbsp;

      Yoooo hooooo..... &nbsp; In another 10 days time, I'll be on a flight to Ho Chi Minh city. Its a 3 day company trip! Oh Boy! So excited about this whole thing! First time there, and there's this trip to visit the Cu Chi tunnel. Have to plan for the itinery as its a Free &amp; Easy trip. &nbsp; Been a hectic month. Finally bought furniture for my new house yesterday and I'm $6000 poorer! :~~~~( &nbsp; I'm looking forward to moving into my new house soon but knowing s-u-p-e-r-s-t-i-t-i-o-u-s mummy, she won't move in during the lunar 7th month since its the HUNGRY GHOST FESTIVAL. YAwnzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....... but I'm so excited about the sofa set! Looks very elegant. Dunno if it will fit nicely into the orange wall. *Well, mum made me repaint the wall because she hated the initial RED that I wanted saying she felt as if she stepped into a temple when she see that RED patch! Grrr...... Can't stand people who dunno how to appreciate ART. &nbsp; Right now I'm left with my own bed ---- a day&nbsp;bed would be good, but seems that no-one really appreciates its function and not many retailers are carrying that! Hmmph!  &nbsp; Also, my bookshelves, fridge, washing machine, kitchen knick-knacks....... Boy! moving house is so tedious! But I'll be glad to have a whole house to myself! Then I can BLAST my music loud and sing to the tunes of my favourite singers! &nbsp; OH~~~ Another exciting thing ------> Mayday has their pictures painted on the tail of a Taiwanese airline! Masa was even worried that birds may hit onto the plane and crashed to their deaths on their faces! Alamak! Looking forward to the movie and soundtrack as well as their 5th Album! Mayday ROCKS!

      I think if I do not finish my work right now, the daggers are going to pierce through my heart and soul!   It's been a tiring week, doing, well, NOTHING! I never knew doing nothing would be so tiring! Really admire those people who can idle their time away man! I think I can never afford to rest and relax. It only makes me more tired!   Going to watch "House of Flying Daggers" tonight since FIRST magazine gave out the invitation. Think I had better prepare lots of tissue and a bucket to make sure Xueling won't drool all over the place! ; ) Better prepare myself not to fall asleep since reviews on the movie is not really good. Like New Paper, they only gave it 2 stars! Better save the 2 stars and let them flicker in the night lah! So stingy!

      Sigh.... time really really flies.... In just another 2 hours and its going to be MONDAY! ARGH! I hate Mondays! I think Garfield and I would be really good pals! Just too bad he's not with me now. Sigh...  I wonder what awaits me tomorrow.  Still haven't pack up for my trip this coming Friday. I hope I dun panic and forget to bring something last minute. Sigh... Looking forward to going to Ho Chi Minh city cos its a foreign and enchanted place. On the other hand, I'll be going with my new colleagues whom I'm not really close to so I'm afraid I won't really enjoy it. Oh well, maybe I worry too much. Maybe everything will be ok. Just be cool! Yeah.  Yesterday evening I went to the Forum BBQ with April. Met lots of mayday fans there, including the 'old birds' like Shirley, Chris, Jean, Florence, and Nicole came at the eleventh hour just in time to catch some 'fireworks'! haha. She just came back from a company trip to Hong Kong, and the moment she touched down at the airport, her dad drove her to Pasir Ris Park to meet us. We took the opportunity to celebrate the July and August&nbsp;birthday babes and hunks.   Am glad I finally got to meet Dizzo aka Cindy whom I've always chatted with on IRC and MSN. She's a cheerful and bubbly 18 year old * ahem, she'll only be 18 on the 26th July! But hey! Its just 2 hours away! and that makes it a MONDAY! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeee  Yawnzzzzzzzzzzz.... Today is wasted just like that. Didn't really do much today. Slept around 2am last night cos after coming back from the BBQ, I took a shower that kept me very refreshed! Should have known better not to take&nbsp;a bath before bedtime! SHIT! But luckily I got up around 9am today or else mum will sure nag and nag nonstop!  Suprani is going back to Indonesia on the 7th August. Looks like she's not able to look at the furnishings. Wonder&nbsp;how life with&nbsp;the new maid would be like. Hope that she doesn't mess up with my stuff or else I'll sure raise a ruckus!   Need to clear my stuff from the dining table by Wednesday as brother bid for a tender to be a vendor in Temasek Polytechnic. They are coming to a food-tasting session on Wednesday and would need the dining table. Sigh... got to move my things and stack it by the TV Console table and after that shift them back to the dining table when they're gone! Wat a bother!

      Reminds me of the musical and my favourite song from the soundtrak "Sun and Moon" ; ) How Romantic!!!  Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh city) is a nice and friendly country. We managed to befriend 2 gals from the Ben Tanh Market and exchanged email addresses. Hopefully they will email Lisa & I and maybe we can get some goods from them and sell at the Carts!! ho ho ho.  This is a fulfilling trip. At least I got to know Saigon better. Experienced 'life in the Cu Chi Tunnel System". I think I not only has a bit of night blindness but a bit caustrophobic! Having to duck-walk in the tunnel made me suffer from muscle aches now! Oh dear... Lisa and I went to the pharmacy to get some Heat Rubs.  We reached Ho Chi Minh city around 11am, but clearing the customs is like taking forever! They are bloody inefficient man! When we reached Hotel Equitorial, its already 12:15pm, and we quickly book the 1pm free city shuttle service provided by the hotel to go to Ben Tanh Market. There are lots of things there. Its like a pasar malam in Singapore as most stalls are selling similar items. We stopped by this souvenir shop first and we were bargaining for a very long time to buy a Vietnamese doll and some smaller versions of the dolls. On the last day, we went back and bought some fridge magnets from her again, and this is the stall which exchanged email addresses with us! She even tried to help us to buy something from another stall but I think the stall owner refused to budge and gave her the same price.  The beef pho in the market is simply delicious! We also packed some dried noodles with some nice sauces and veggies, bean curd.... that only costs 5000 dong! and a pack of something like seng kway that costs only 3000 dong! for dinner!!! Market food is not too bad after all! ; )~~ Sedap! I simply missed the pho.... We ate from the same stall on the last day and surprisingly, the gal still remembered us!!  It was raining pretty heavily on the first day. We took a cab back to the hotel and enjoyed our dinner. Around 6plus, we went to Serene and Rebecca's room and decided that we should go out again. Hence, we took a cab together Shufen, Meifen, Christina and her husband Jim, Rebecca and Serene to City Plaza Shopping Plaza at District One. Things there are so expensive and they don't accept US Dollars! Shit! While queueing up to pay our things, the man behind us came up and had two packets of WORMS! GULP! Looks pretty scary! and they actually ate such stuff!  I bought lots of Bags, their traditional costumes - au dai for Eunice, Emlyn, Joanne, Daryl and Xavier. Also got some clogs, dried jackfruit chips, my burberry's wallet (For only US$5!), my communist T-shirt and 2 Vietnamese style blouses and also some sequined purses.  The Cu Chi tunnel system walk is really tedious! but its really amazing! They are really SMART to come up with traps with simple tools to Kill the US Armies! ; )  After that we went to Liberty Restaurant in District One for dinner. Food is OK but not very Vietnamese leh!  We also ventured to another market called An Dong Market which is about 10 mins walk behind our hotel. They actually sell DRIED Frogs and fish that are still alive and kicking in the market! What an eye-opener! ;)  Well, I hope to go back again and this time go and visit places of interest. Ciao! I have a movie to catch!
