      ..... or so I've been told ???    I'm back with more whitterings from hell !  Hope you're ready ;-)  Whatta week!!  Have been so busy I've hardly had time to scratch myself !!  Not that I scratch myself often... I hasten to add - no fleas here, baby!  lol  Received a package that I sent to the States in April... back on my doorstep late last week.  I felt absolutely sick to the stomach when I saw that USPS had tried to deliver it 3 times before returning it to me..... the recipient was a guy in the American military and my first thought was "oh God he's been killed in Iraq".  I honestly thought I was holding a dead man's parcel in my hands - horrible feeling, even though I didn't know this guy.  Imagine my relief to receive an email from him today - highly apologetic he was, too and offering to make payment for the extra postage to send it to him again.  Told him not to worry about it and I would hold the "skin set" for his PS2 in my stock room until he got back home.  Like this poor bugger needs to be worrying about a PS2 skins set payment right now??? I think not, folks ! Mind you, he probably thinks I'm a loony - I was so relieved to hear from him LOL      Anyway - I really have to get back to finalising the new pages on my website for the xbox console comp and new stock and games that I need to upload in the next 48 hours!  Will write again soon.....

      I don't think there's any turning back now - I'm here - I'm doing the blog thang !  What am I supposed to do here - just whitter on relentlessly until you email me into submission to stop??  LOL    This is a bit like stumbling on to a big stage in a theatre somewhere - blinding lights in your eyes, so it takes you a few minutes to realise there are, like, a THOUSAND people watching and waiting for you to say something.... couple of tentative steps forward to the microphone.... blow into it to see if it's working.... high pitch squeal tells you it is working ...hmm... now what to say  *cough cough*  Errmmmm... you hear a few embarrassed giggles from the audience and you feel positively mortified - a blush creeps up and beams out from your cheeks, bathing the audience in its soft warm glow !    Ok - here goes ......  Welcome - these will be the rantings and ramblings of a 37 yr old woman, residing in Brisbane Australia.  I take no responsibility for your boredom or other adverse reactions to my postings - after all, it's your choice to be here!  Mind you, if you like what you read and come back for more - then I take full responsibility of course :-)  For those of you who don't know me - I'm an eBay powerseller (sounds important - but means diddley squat really) and sell all kinds of things ..... vinyl " skins " for gaming consoles, CD's, books, DVD's, mobile phone accessories, posters - you name it n' I'll try selling it LOL   I love eBay - it got me out of a personal crisis/rut in April '03 and, since starting to sell, things have just grown and grown and I now sell full time.    Lurve what I do - but you do get the occasional truly obnoxious or difficult person to deal with.  Kill 'em with kindness is my motto ;-)  Sometimes works!  If you like to buy on eBay occasionally, then I thoroughly recommend the following sellers:  buymebuymebuy (ME haha) cherry6autumn - All kinds of wonderful thangs !! connorboy26 - GBA SP games and accessories bridalonline - the name says it all I think ! loving-hearts - clothing  stampsoz - collectables   ****** Well I started this 3 days ago!!!!  I'm not sure why but actually posting this stuff for public to read TERRIFIES me - so I keep holding off on hitting the "publish post" button!  I can safely say I'm in a bit of a rut today.  Have absolutely no energy and inspiration to list on eBay or work on the website.      Reason for this is a horrendous few days with eBay and Paypal.  Have had a fraudulent chargeback made by a past eBay buyer of mine - so now the buyer has his goods AND has leeched the USD 38.00 he paid for the items, from my Paypal account as well GRRRRR   That makes me sooooooo mad.    On top of this I need to whinge about my one and only truly NIGHTMARE transaction on eBay.  A buyer purchased a jewel skin from me.  She bid on and won the auction, she paid (yayyy) and I sent out the item.  All smooth so far, you might think?  Nooooooo.... about 2 weeks after sending the jewel skin to her I get this nasty email demanding to know where her item is and threatening to leave me negative feedback.  I sprang into action - genuinely worried that she hadn't received her package but a little pissed that she was so damn rude about it.  What's wrong with a friendly email to ask about the postage status??  *sigh*  Anyway - to cut a long story short - after a few emails back and forth (trying to get information out of this woman was like getting blood out of a stone!)I was finally able to establish that her package HAD arrived....... but...... *drum roll*.......  SHE HAD THROWN OUT THE JEWEL SKIN WITH THE PACKAGING !!!  BOOM-TISH!  *silent scream*  Of course the buyer left me a neg and tried to use that as leverage to encourage me to send  her a replacement Jewel skin (i.e. send me a replacement and i'll remove the neg).  BAH ! NO WAY, HONEY! Perhaps if she had been more courteous about it all - and admitted she'd stuffed up - I'd have gladly sent out a replacement at no charge.  You'd think that would be the end of it, wouldn't you?  Noooooooo - she started emailing me again yesterday !!  Now she's muttering something about how I should notify eBay of her payment or something???? I think she's received non paying bidder warnings from other sellers she's purchased from (but obviously not paid!) and ... well....... WHO GIVES A RATS !  I give up on that one  LOL  Hopefully the nightmare buyer from hell will just go away eventually.......  See?  I'm developing the eBay seller's nervous twitch !  LOL  If my bad eBay run continues - I'll be in the eBay Asylum in no time... bouncing around that eBay padded cell, rocking back and forth muttering things like "must list..must list" and "nooooo not another npb... please GOD.. not another npb!"  When the nurses come to give me my pills I will be backing into the corner screaming "NOOOO... YOU'RE A ZERO BIDDER !!! GET AWAY !! "  Well, after that little vent - I suppose I should get inspired and do some eBay listing so I can sell stuff in order to obtain $$'s to eat this week *grin*     OH OH... before I go !    Have any of you tried those "find your old school friends" site thingies yet??  I registered with www.schoolfriends.com.au last year and have had a few emails from kids I remember at school (and some I don't!!).   The weirdest thing is knowing what to SAY to someone you last spoke to as a 17 yr old 20 yrs ago!!!!  Mind you, it's fascinating to find out what people are doing with themselves these days. The people I thought would be mega-millionaires or working as high-flying lawyers, doctors etc AREN'T .... yet the kids we all thought were dumb at school are the ones doing really well.  Funny how life turns out, isn't it??  Well... on that rather boring observation... I'll see if my quivering wimp of a finger can make it to the PUBLISH POST button and press it!!    Talk soon !!!

      ..... Here I am, again !  Still not really in the "groove" for this blog stuff, am I?  *grin*  Quite a bit has happened since my last entry, but buggered if I can remember half of it (oh god.. i'm going senile already??)  I've decided to dedicate this particular "blog entry" to Tsu - whose email tonight gave me the kick up the butt that I needed to actually come here and write!!   Tsu seems to be a very talented designer of furniture?  I have yet to investigate further but on first glance Tsu's work is really interesting.  You can see it  urlLink HERE   Ok - here's what been happening since I last posted.  Channel 9 called me to ask if I would agree to an interview about my eBay life.  Errrr NO THANKS !!  I've seen people on current affairs proggies and have to say that the idea of splattering my noggin on tv screens across Qld does NOT appeal one little bit  LOL  (damn - could have been my one ticket to stardom? PMSL I think not!)  MIND YOU - I did consider it could be a great opportunity to do a "Merlin" and duct tape my mouth, whilst holding up a sign saying "CHANGE THE EBAY FEEDBACK SYSTEM" (or something!!)  lol   Errrr.... those fans of Aussie Big Brother will know what I am talking about ;-)  Speaking of eBay - am finally getting the will to list again after 3 or so weeks of taking it relatively easy.  Needed the break, for sure - especially after reaching my nutter-attracting 1000 feedback ;-)  Ok, so the nutty feedback rattled me for a while - I'm human you know!  (says Jo putting on an "elephant man" voice and wailing "i am nooooot an animaaaal").  Have also started posting on the Community Boards again - but with a posting ID so that the psychotic auction bomber known as Match doesn't target my listings.  I'm SUCH a wimp  LOL  Had a few Trading Assistant requests come through in the last few days.  Have accepted the role of TA for one lady and will be listing a few items for her next week.   Will wait to hear from the other enquir-ees.  Some really interesting stuff they have!  Mind you, I still think the best item I've been asked to sell was a LIFE SIZE robotic dolphin from a Disney film!!  lol     Actually, if you have never stumbled across some of the funnier listings on eBay -  urlLink THIS  is one that takes the cake (in my view).  There's more - like the listing for an INVISIBLE SHIRT (came with a guy modelling the shirt, too - and a great description of why everyone needs an invisible shirt) but they are no longer available to view.    For those wondering....... yes, I do have a life away from eBay - but I'm just not ready to natter on to you about my personal stuff just yet ;-)  Hey, a girl's gotta have a BIT of mystery !!   Mind you, as a b/f once told me - "there's a difference between being mysterious and just plain freakin' WEIRD!"  lol   Umm...no.... he wasn't referring to me, at the time ;-)  OMG - it's my birthday soon!!  How come birthdays roll around so FAST after you turn 30??  It's not fair because I have the brain and attitude of an 18 yr old but my body doesn't want to keep up anymore *sigh*    From the sublime to the ridiculous........  .....The crystal xbox skin design competition started with a bang a few weeks back - but has gone very quiet for the time being.  There's a few more weeks to go so entrants probably have heads down and bums up working on designs - can't WAIT to see entries in a few weeks' time!!  The website is getting a HUGE amount of visits each day - but I'm pulling my hair out trying to work out why few people seem to stay and buy.  It's not pricing, as our pricing (on some items) is actually cheaper than the manufacturer! So what IS it??   Hmmmm - if anyone reads this and has some constructive criticism - please let me know.  Ok - that will do for now!  Time for me to bugger off!!  ;-)  Oh... and Cherry - if you read this - *huge hugs* to you - i wuvs ya heaps, my friend!!   *grin*  (embarrassed yet?)    Jo xxxx
