						    urlLink "Secure Configuration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays" by Tom Kean, Algotronix   Also refers to:  urlLink "Secure Configuration of a Field Programmable Gate Array", Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Field  Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM), Rohnert Park CA , 2001. [download PDF 34.8kB]. Copyright Notice: © 2001 IEEE.   Notes:  1. Review:Approaches to Bitstream Security  (1).Ignorance is Bliss  The conventional approach to preventing design reverse engineering by 'decompiling' the bitstream was for manufacturers to keep the configuration memory layout of the devices secret and only release it under Non-Disclosure Agreement - 'security through obscurity'.  (2).Encapsulation Atmel's FPSLIC chip is a 'system level integration' device packaging the non-volatile configuration memory with the FPGA. However, the chip could easily be "de-cap"ed.  (3).User Defined Key Pilkington's solution: A non-volatile key register built from EPROM cells on the FPGA device. bitstream is encrypted and is decrypted inside the FPGA. Disadvantage: non-standard processing of the FPGA device as both EPROM and SRAM integrated in the same chip.  Xilinx's variant: SRAM based key register. Battery is used to backup the key. Disadvantage: battery reliability.  (4).Secure Serial Memory Secure protocol between a secure serial EPROM and an FPGA.  (5).Manufacturer Defined Key 'all the eggs in one basket'  (6).Hardware Token Based Schemes A secure CPLD cooperate with insecure FPGA. Could prevent piracy but weak protection against reverse engineering.   2.Desirable Features in a Bitstream Security System   1. The scheme should provide strong protection against both reverse engineering and 'cloning'.  ( AGREE ) 2. No additional components should required on the customer board, so there is no cost penalty.  ( GOOD BUT NOT NECESSARY ) 3. There should be no effect on the reliability of the user board or need for additional service in the field.  ( IS RELIABILITY REALLY A PROBLEM ?) 4. The user should not have to maintain a database of encryption keys in order to allow for future changes to the design. ( I GOT SOME SOLUTIONS ) 5. There should be no significant complication to the manufacturing flow for products containing the FPGA.  (AGREE) 6. No changes should be required to the CAD tools or design flow. In particular, no information which could compromise the security of the scheme should be embedded in CAD tools or their supporting files.  ( YES and NO. security should not be embedded into software but must be together with the bitstream files, otherwise the files must be well protected. Can you give the non-encrypted files to engineers/customers and trust them not to leak it? ) 7. The scheme should be compatible with standard CMOS processing.  ( AGREE ) 8. The scheme should be based on well understood and standardized cryptographic algorithms and usage modes to allow easy analysis of threats and should not depend on 'security through obscurity'.  (AGREE) 9. The scheme should be upward compatible with standard programming modes and standard non-volatile memories. It should allow for design upgrades in the field and design changes during prototyping. (AGREE)     3. A New Bitstream Security System  The FPGA has an on-chip secret key which is unknown even to the FPGA customer. (1).The initial configuration of the FPGA within the customer facility: the bitstream is encrypted by the FPGA using the secret key and stored outside the FPGA. (2).The "in-field" operation of the FPGA: the FPGA decrypt the bitstream using the internally stored key and load it into configuration memory.   Cipher-block-chaining (CBC) mode can be used to implement the encryption and decryption functions. CBC mode removes any patterns which would otherwise be present in highly regular data such as FPGA bitstreams, it also provides a cryptographic checksum which can be used to detect tampering with the file.   This security scheme requires a non-volatile key register within the FPGA chip. It is suggested that laser programmed fuses are used to implant a random key on each chip during the manufacturing process.   4. Simplified Piracy Protection FPGA had the same encryption key embedded into the design artwork through changes in one of the masks used in fabrication (to prevent reverse engineering). The mask could also be alterable (to prevent cloning).

						    urlLink "FPGA Design Security Issues: Using the ispXPGA® Family of FPGAs to Achieve High Design Security" by Lattice   Notes:  1. How Does Your Design Get Pirated?  (1). Cloning. (2). Reverse Engineering. (3). Overbuilding: overbuilding occurs when a contract manufacturer builds more than the requested quantity of systems, often copying them down to the last detail. (4). Theft of Services.   2. Security of ASIC Technology   ASICs are actually one of the easier technologies to reverse engineer. It can be considered to have a moderate (MOD) security level within a system.   3. SRAM FPGA   The data link between the FPGA and the PROM represents a significant security risk. The SRAM FPGA is considered to have a LOW level of security.   4. Encryption of SRAM FPGA Configuration pattern (Xilinx devices)  Configuration data is encrypted and stored in external PROM. A key is present in the SRAM of the target FPGA. The key is powered via an on-board battery.  Advantage:  (1). very difficult to attack; (2). online upgradable/reprogrammable. Disadvantage: (1). reliability: Batteries have a limited life, especially at high temperature. ( In my opinion, not a too serious problem. Consider the fact that there is a battery in every PC ). (2). Key management: have to maintain a database of each key. ( Note: I found an excellent idea to solve this problem ).  Encryption of SRAM FPGA devices can be considered to have only a moderate (MOD) security level. ( Not agree. Actually should be MODH, or even higher .)   5. OTP (One Time Programmable) FPGA Technology (Antifuse technology by Actel & QuickLogic)  The antifuse FPGA has a moderately high (MODH) security level.  Disadvantage: (1). expensive (2). inflexible (non-reprogrammable)   6. Non-volatile Reprogrammable FPGA Technology (Flash based technology)  higher security level than the volatile SRAM-based FPGAs. Non-volatile FPGAs have a moderately high (MODH) security level.  (1). Actel's  Disadvantage:  (a).it requires two non-standard voltages to reprogram the device; (b).unable to upgrade/reprogram online.  (2). Lattice's (ispXPGA family) Advantage: No need of multiple voltages during programming. Disadvantage:  Still unable to upgrade/reprogram online as plain configuration data needed to reprogram the chip! USELESS!  Apparently Lattice is trying to ignore this problem. If a FPGA chip was shipped to customer, how can you upgrade it without risking to leak the design?

						   IBM's classic article outlined three categories of security depending on the sophistication and resources of the “cracker.   urlLink D. Abraham, G. Dolan, G. Double, J.Stevens, “Transaction Security System”, IBM Systems Journal v. 30, no. 2 (1991), pp 206-229    Class I (clever outsiders)-They are often very intelligent but may have insufficient knowledge of the system. They may have access to only moderately sophisticated equipment. They often try to take advantage of an existing weakness in the system, rather than try to create one.  Class II (knowledgeable insiders)-They have substantial specialized technical education and experience. They have varying degrees of understanding of parts of the system but potential access to most of it. They often have access to highly sophisticated tools and instruments for analysis.  Class III (funded organizations)-They are able to assemble teams of specialists with related and complementary skills backed by great funding resources. They are capable of in-depth analysis of the system, designing sophisticated attacks, and using the most sophisticated analysis tools. They may use Class I1 adversaries as part of the attack team.   Security Level Definitions  HIGH: All known attacks have been unsuccessful. Some research by a team of specialists is necessary. Highly specialized equipment is necessary, some of which might have to be designed and built. Total cost of the attack could be one million dollars or more. The success of the attack is uncertain.  MODH: Equipment is available but is expensive to buy and operate. Cost may range from $50,000 to $200,000 or more. Special skills and knowledge are required to utilize the equipment for an attack. More than one operation may be required so that several adversaries with complementary skills would have to work on the attack sequence. The attack could be unsuccessful.  MOD: Special tools and equipment are required, as well as some special skills and knowledge. The tools and equipment may cost from $5000 to $50,000. The attack may become time-consuming but will eventually be successful.  MODL: More expensive tools are required, as well as some specialized knowledge. Tool cost may range from $500 to $5000. The attack may become time-consuming but will eventually be successful.  LOW: Some security features in place. They are relatively easily defeated with common laboratory or shop tools such as pliers, soldering iron, or small microscope.  Zero: No special security features added to the system. Example: a standard PC in a room with free access.

						    urlLink CoolRunner-II CPLDs in Secure Applications   Notes: 1.Simple PLDs introduced read and write protect bits to control the access of contents. These bits could be attacked with partial erasure.  2.More complex PLDs are more secure by hidding protect bits and using more metal layers.  Various protect bits are embedded within the main programming array, hidden under layers of metal and distributed throughout the die.  3.Attacks: (1).Brute Force (2).Power Attack: A power attack usually targets a microprocessor and develops a time profile of current drawn. (3).Glitch Attacks: Glitch attacks simply violate a chip’s specified timing. (4).Tempest Attacks: (also known as EMF sideband attack) will divulge distinctive electromagnetic field patterns that can be correlated with data transactions. (5).Reverse Engineering: may be the ultimate attack. (6).Toothpick Attack: is an invented term for that unknown attack, the attack-yet-tocome.  4.Still risky?  CoolRunner-II provides substantial design protection for Class 1 and 2 attackers. The read protect methods block all but the Class 3 attackers.  5.Critism about anti-fuse technology:  It is possible to distinguish where on the chip the programming bits are by observing their programming. Current required for an antifuse to change state is typically several milliamps, which makes an observable thermal event. Inexpensive laboratory equipment can deduce the location of the security bits by thermal inspection. Antifuse sites are located on outer metal layers. ( Maybe not suitable now ?).Their location on outer layers makes them available for erasing. Creating an open circuit at the antifuse site will accomplish that.  Unlike nonvolatile EPROM technologies or SRAM, it is not possible to easily reprogram an antifuse product  (I think it is vital). Reprogrammability keeps attackers at bay by allowing for an astronomical number of possible designs and re-designs on a single part.  5.Critism about Microprocessors:  Microprocessor attacks are well documented. Their primary weakness stems from the wide publication of their instruction sets and electrical properties. Embedded processors with programmable fabric contained in the same chip definitely have merit for creating strong cryptographic algorithms and fitting the Common Criteria model for secure cryptographic modules.  6.Critism about ASICs:  One big problem with ASICs is that if an internal algorithm or protocol is cracked, ASICs can’t easily be changed.

						    urlLink Xcell Journal Online -- Is Your FPGA Design Secure? article   1. Xilinx's Virtex-II Pro FPGAs have Triple DES security embedded in them. 2. There are two major types of design theft – cloning and reverse engineering. 3.  ASICs and ASSPs implement a fixed function and are vulnerable to attack, because every via/connection represents real logic. An attacker can de-cap such chips to observe the vias and hack the design. Plus, in a fixed IC, if you suspect that the security of one chip is compromised, then all the chips are compromised. With programmable ICs, however, if one chip is compromised, all the other chips can be reprogrammed.  4. Attack nonvolatile (flash/anti-fuse) programmable logic device:  Fixed security bits are built with antifuse or flash gates to prevent read/write from the device after it is ready. The security bits have fixed locations and can be distinguished by observing ... using thermal imaging. Once distinguished, the security bits can be disabled with a high-intensity light source impinged on the die to allow read-back.  5. However, Xilinx declare that although their CoolRunner CPLDs use flash technology, their could survive from such sort of attack.  Sounds like a paradox in my opinion . Refer to:   urlLink CoolRunner-II CPLDs in Secure Applications   6. In Virtex-II Pro FPGA, encrypted bitstream is stored in external PROM and loaded into and decrypted inside the FPGA.   The keys reside in a special Triple DES block at the corner of the device. An external battery is used to hold the keys when the board is powered off.   The keys cannot be observed without erasing the chip. Nine layers of metal pose yet another barrier to would-be thieves.   Each Virtex-II Pro device provides six separate keys, thus allowing two sets of Triple DES keys.  7.   Triple DES is an official NIST and ANSI X9.52 standard. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the next generation of encryption that will be adopted by the industry if and when Triple DES is cracked.

						   Professor Ross Anderson's article about hardware security. Is hardware robust enough to be 'tamperproof'?   Abstract:  An increasing number of systems, from pay-TV to electronic purses, rely on the tamper resistance of smartcards and other security processors. We describe a number of attacks on such systems - some old, some new and some that are simply little known outside the chip testing community. We conclude that trusting tamper resistance is problematic; smartcards are broken routinely, and even a device that was described by a government signals agency as `the most secure processor generally available' turns out to be vulnerable. Designers of secure systems should consider the consequences with care.    urlLink Tamper Resistance - a Cautionary Note    Notes:   1. Taxonomy of attackers  Class I (clever outsiders) Class II (knowledgeable insiders) Class III (funded organisations)  2. ASIC is theoretically vulnerable to tampering as its circuit could be reverse engineered. This paper shows various ways of attacking.  3.  However, this paper does not mention the secure FPGAs. Secure FPGA should be safer than ASIC. It is impossible to detect the status of millions of EEPROM/anti-fuse cells, reverse engineer the circuit and find out the secret key.   4. A universal secret could harm the system as once a chip is cracked, the whole system is cracked.   Public key techniques offer some solace, as the number of universal secrets can be greatly reduced - ideally, to a small number of certification keys, that can then be protected in depth.   5.  systems use symmetric cryptography with universal secrets...should be designed to keep on working after these secrets have been compromised - such as by supporting a fallback processing mode similar to that for credit cards, with full reconciliation, intrusion detection, hot lists and security recovery   6. Hostile testing/review is useful.

      Payment methods  There are a number of different payment methods that can be used when you deal with us. Three mostly used are T/T payment in advance and L/C.  T/T payment in advance  T/T means telegraphic transfer, or simply wire transfer. It's the simplest and easiest payment method to use.   T/T payment in advance is usually used when the sample and small quantity shipments are transported by air. The reason why is that the documents like air waybill, commercial invoice and packing list will be sent to you along with the shipment by the same plane. As soon as the shipment arrives, you can clear the customs and pick up the goods with the documents. As it's acknowledged, T/T payment in advance presents risk to the importer if the supplier is not an honest one.  For us, T/T advance payment is required for some high-value samples (see our samples ordering policy) and small quantity order shipped by air.   It takes 3-4 days for us to received the wire transfer made from anywhere in the world.  Letter of credit  An irrevocable Letter of Credit is also an often used payment method. It is often referred to an L/C. Letters of Credit are formal payment methods that offer a lot of protection to the parties.  Simply put, a letter of credit is a letter written by the importer's bank to the exporter. It verifies that the payment will be guaranteed when the bank is presented with the concrete documents (bill of lading, and freight documents). Most letters of credit are "irrevocable" once the importer has had them sent.  A letter of credit usually includes applicant (you, the importer), beneficiary (our I/E agent), opening bank, negotiating bank, specification and quantity of the goods, amount of money, loading port and destination port, shipment date, the validity date of the L/C, terms and conditions agreed by both the importer and seller, and the documents required by the importers (bill of lading, commercial invoice, packing list, insurance certificate, etc.)   The L/C payment procedure is usually as follows:  a. You (the importer) applies to open the L/C to us (the seller) through a bank who can open the L/C in your country.  b. The opening bank will inform The Bank of China that the L/C has been opened.  c. The Bank of China will inform us that the L/C has been established.  d. We'll check all the terms and conditions listed in the L/C. If all terms and conditions are acceptable, we'll arrange the shipment within the time specified in the L/C.  e. After the goods are loaded onto the ship without any damage, the captain will issue the clean bill of lading to us.  f. We will submit the clean bill of lading and other relevant documents to The Bank of China to gather the payment. Only with clean bill of lading can you claim the ownership of the goods. g. The Bank of China will send the clean bill of lading and relevant documents to your bank (the opening bank).  h. The opening bank will inform you that all documents are received.  i. You will go to the bank to make the payment to get the clean bill of lading and relevan documents.  j. With all of these documents, you can clear the import Customs and pick up the goods after the goods arrive on the destination sea port.  L/C is used for the larger quantity order shipped by sea.   The typical L/C scenario takes 14-21 days to complete.

      1.Go to see an  accountant  - most will do free, or fixed fee first consultation. 2.Try your local Chamber of Commerce / Business Link. They give free helpful advice to people starting out, or expanding, and in some cases there are grants available to help you get your business going. 3.It costs the client considerably more to produce accounts and meet other legislative requirements as a Ltd Company than as a Sole Trader. 4.The main benefit of having Ltd status for smaller traders is protection from creditors. For most small traders who don't buy very much on credit from suppliers, there is no real advantage to incorporating. 5.Companies House are not even vaguely interested in what you did prior to incorporation...so no worries there. 6.You do need to consider the record keeping requirements of the  Inland Revenue  and whether you must register for  VAT . There is no real difference in these requirements for Sole Traders and small companies. 7.The best advice is to go and see a good local accountant (preferably from a very small practice, large ones tend to be prohibitively expensive), who will discuss all your options in greater detail and give you wise advice. If you can get a personal recommendation so much the better as the quality of advice can vary considerably. You should decide in advance what you want your accountant to do for you, record keeping, legislative compliance, tax saving advice, estate planning etc etc. 8.Finally, with more and more tax investigations these days some sort of insurance against the cost of Inland Revenue investigations is, in my opinion, a good idea. The Federation of Small Businesses offers this as part of their membership package and it is certainly worthy of consideration.

      Tax wise you basically pay  25%  of your profits to the tax man, which is paid once a year at the end of your finacial year. The first £4000 aprox is tax free then you are taxed after that

       Where to look for help?  1. Local tax advice centre 2. Speak to the Inland revenue and ask them to send you the package called "becoming self employed". The pack is very informative and guides you through tax and national insurance implications. They also do half day seminars that tell you how to work out profit and loss, what business expenses are legitimate and which are not. 3. Local enterprise trust  If you register yourself as a  limited company  you will have to pay  corporation tax . You will need to tell the inland revenue and you can pay class 2  national insurance  which is only £2.05 a week and protects yourself for benefits and state pension.  If you earn up to  £4,615  in a tax year (that was at least the amount for 2003-04) there is no need to register, since this amount is non-taxable. If you earn more than that or expect to earn more than that amount you have to register with the Inland Revenue. If Inland Revenue finds out that you have been conducting your business for more than 6 months AND that in that time you had made more money than the non-taxable amount you will have to pay tax on these earnings plus you may be liable for a £100 fine because you didn't register as a trader earlier. Further, if your turnover is something above £55,000 (???) you have to register for VAT.    Registration with the Inland Revenue  is simple. You just walk in, say that you want to register as self-employed, they take your details (including National Insurance number) and the first thing that happens is that you pay a £2 per week National Insurance Class 2 contributions. Later in April they will send you a self-assesment form. Your income from self-employment has to be declared separately from other sources of income.
