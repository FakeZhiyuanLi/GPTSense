      Yesterday was a hectic day for me because I do a lot of cleaning and i felt so tired. i finally shifted back to my tiny miny flat house at cheras which is more convenient for me the best part was I got a personal ahmad to bring me around and send me to work.He IS MY BROTHER! if he sees this he sure gonna slaughter me. :P   Last night I went to klang for seafood.The food there were fantastic *yummielicious* i din eat that much.Do you know why?because instead of dinner it became my supper. ish! I Have to wait for my bro friends to reach my place to follow us because they don't know the way. Me and my bf got lost in the woods. *joking* we made the wrong turning. so we U turn back to the main road and we manage to get to that reataurant in time to EAT. hehe.. After makan my bro send me home and my bf go home by himself because he's staying at bukit jalil which is much more convenient for him instead of drop me back to cheras.  By the way, I already watched King Arthur, I love this kind of movie! I gonna watch it again. :P  That's all. ciao!

      Someone complaint that i din blog... hahaha.. no lar. I'm just being lazy lately.  Last night i didn't go out because tired and LAZY as usual. hehe..So i stay home be a goodie girl watch tv with papa. Actually i did call VIRAL out but she not feeling well..poor girl. I sayang-sayang you ar.. *muach*. I damn dillemma now because i can't decide whether to get Sony Ericsson K700i or an new iPod..Please tell me which one is better! Aight!  Hm.. my bf and bro ask me to get iPod because is worth buying it. Yeah.. i know! big capacity, can loads in songs, store data and etc but no camera, no colour screen and can't make calls. For the sony ericsson k700i have 32mb memory and you can't add in extra memory like P900 do. I wanted to get P900 but damn bulky. back to the memory 32MB really damn little.. u store few pictures and few Mp3s. There goes my 32Mb.. *sigh*   I'm so happy that my beloved one bought me a CD *pirated cd* damn bloody nice is pilates music. Don't ask me the title, it printed there pilates that's it.I listen to the cd this morning and automatically i practice my Yoga. haha.. i can't stretch that much because i stop yoga quite a while. The feeling like you want to breaks your bones apart. i don't know how to descript the feeling.. *malu* I just like an 80 yrs old lady. hehe.  *Viral dont you dare to say i din blog ar... i did! * take care people! *as if got people know i do blogging* hahahahahaha..

I wanted to sleep but i ate too much and i can't go to bed straight away. *sigh* I went to ttdi with Emily, Albert, Alvin, Shawn, me and my brother for yum char but ended up makan at Restaurant OK. Please don't go there and eat.. damn bloddy expensive and taste sucks. So we all decided to go to kepong for second round.we ordered roasted chicken wings, the famous hokkien mee, balitong, and leung sui. *Yummies* hahaha..  Today training was great it takes about 2 hours to finish. Something very weird, my trainer and gavin look alike.. hehe.just a older and younger version. He's kinda cute..hehe..Darn! my brother bought two boxes of ferrero rocher and they're eating them infront of me. I thought of not eating but i can't tahan at last i took one and I eat em'.  I can't think of anything now. I'm so sleepy! I need to go to bed now. *yawnz* nite nite!
