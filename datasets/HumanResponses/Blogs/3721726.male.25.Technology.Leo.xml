      Saw an  urlLink article  on  urlLink Slashdot  about  urlLink Senator Orrin Hatch's  latest vomit, the (formerly)  urlLink INDUCE  act.  My favorite snippit from the Slashdot snippit is this:    urlLink EFF  has shown how broad the Act is by writing a mock lawsuit [PDF] suing Apple (for making the iPod), C|Net (for reviewing the iPod), and Toshiba (for supplying hard drives for iPods)   Lets hope this doesn't get through 8(  And in other news, apparently,  urlLink Che Lives

      Digital cameras are women.  No other explaination is possible.  Disagreeable, illogical, obtuse, and vengeful -- yet seductively desireable.    Curse you Neptune!

Checked the site for the mix name and its  DJ Myers - Contempo 7

      In an  urlLink article on ZDnet , internet security researchers are warning of yet another IE vulnerability thats being exploited to illicit gain.  Only this time the organized crime units pulling this off are stepping up and showing their hand a little, none of this crap about exploiting only vulnerabilities that are previously known about.  I have to wonder if this is a scouting excursion, meant to see how fast some of these companies are about bringing down the hammer.  Or maybe it's just a lucky spam group, who knows?  Anyway, with no patch released to plug the two vulnerabilities, IE users beware.  Especially since the nature of the exploit is allowing well established business sites and portals to spread the infection.

       Southern Gun & Pawn  ( urlLink Mike West :  Oddities and Rarities )  "This is the scariest redneck song I know.  Written by an Italian from Boston, Massachusetts -- it's a wonderful world we live in.  All the best redneck songs gotta start with one four-letter four-syllable word, you know what that is?    Thats hard work...  Whaae haeeee heeelll llllllll.... I.  Had.  To pawn, the gun.  To buy the bullets."    I was introduced to this stylistic anomoly by my good buddy Baka (a.k.a. Josh)  I heard on local radio station WABB that Mike West was going to be at "Guy's Gumbo Shack" tonight, although as their broadcast area is the Mobile/Pensecola area primarily, I'm not exactly sure where Guy's Gumbo Shack is.  I think I'll Google it!  Update:  urlLink GUY'S GUMBO SHACK  (251) 928-4100 2 S CHURCH STREET FAIRHOPE, AL 36532  Thats just a few blocks from my house...I wonder if I'll go?  Update 2 :  Called Guy's, and Mike West is indeed playing tonight, at about 9pm.  Decesions decesions.  Do I go and have a good listen, or hermit myself within' a game?

      I must say, Crystal Chronicles is quite entertaining.  The schedule for work this week and next is pretty effed up, with lots of PTO taking and what not.  I'll be working 0730 to 1900 on Friday, and the same on Monday.  But then I'll be off on Tuesday and Wednesday, then back to work on Thursday at 0730 to 1630, with normality resuming from then out.  This Saturday I'll be commiting acts of nearly unconscionable injustice against a member of the fairer sex in Magic: The Gathering, it almost makes my heart of coal warm.  Other activities are sure to occur as well, they always do, although none are currently expressly planned, my exhaustive memory banks tell me.    Let the Wookie win.

      The NYTimes has a  urlLink story  about a kid in Germany who has the first documented (in humans) case of a genetic mutation that causes a gene called myostatin to remain inactive.  Myostatin is responsible for limiting muscle growth.  The only previous cases were where researches at Johns Hopkins had initiated the same behavior in mice, nicknaming them "Mighty Mice."  The kid's 4 now, but can hold up two six and a half pound weights (one in each hand) with his arms extended parallel to the ground.  Neato skeeto!  Can you imagine what stuff like this would do to the professional sports world if it could be replicated via drugs or treatments?  Stolen from  urlLink Slashdot   Another  urlLink link , this one from  urlLink Scientific America , on gene doping.

      So I helped my parents move some of the heavier appliances in their kitchen area.  They are getting new flooring installed in the hallway, and kitchen / dining room area, so a refrigerator, a stove, a trash compacter and a dish washer had to be transported to various and sundry locations within the abode.  Everything but the 'frige was pretty easy, except for the part where I might have broken the dish washer 8(, which while easy, sucked.  Afterwords we ate KFC, hung out, and then I went home...  And played Crystal Chronicles with my roommate / best buddy Cory until 1:30 in the morning.  I'm such a delinquent.

      I was playing Capcom's   urlLink Dungeons and Dragons: Tower of Doom   last night, and it was awesome.  It's not the first time I've ever played it, of course.  I remember adolescent arcade runs taking hours and many dollars playing Tower of Doom 8)  In no way reflecting on my actual manhood, I always play the Elf, as she's basically a Fighter/Magic-User, and Lightning Bolt is the pwn.

      So I woke up this morning at 07:38.  I'm due in at work at 07:30 -- woopsie.  Nobody else in my department was in when I actually rolled up at 08:30, and as they're not due in until 09:00 I probably could have at least taken a shower.  8(  I hate being unclean.  Like when I happened upon a  urlLink Loxodon Warhammer , or a leper.  So I've been thinking about the blogging phenomenon, and wondering why some people blog.  It's a crazy world we live in, I guess, where your good buddies  mom  has a blog.    there...is...another...Sky..walker

      Holy wow  urlLink this article(Crushing by elephant)  is neato.  My favorite part is about Mogul Emperor Akbar, who considered his royal elephant to be able to discern by instinct who was guilty or not.  If the elephant crushed you, you were guilty, if it didn't, you were instantly released -- as clear proof of your innocence was just demonstrated.  I want a trained assassin elephant.  From Slashdot  Games: World Computer Chess Championships Underway    Posted by timothy on Tuesday July 06, @07:00PM from the hushed-crowd dept. azaris writes "While the  urlLink FIDE World Championships  for human players in Tripoli, Libya are down to the last two contestants, the computers are playing their own  urlLink 12th World Computer Chess Championship  in Ramat-Gan, Israel. How will the open source chess engine  urlLink Crafty  do against the proprietary closed engines? Will the computers play more interesting chess than their human counterparts?"  Also, I need to get some sort of portable implant head-jack thingy capable of checking my email every nanosecond, with logic filters for actions based on what it finds, and lets me know.

      Random Stuff:    urlLink Digital Blasphemy: White Magic  Digital Blasphemy is an image site, with some free wallpapers.  Typically high quality stuff.  Mostly fantasy / sci-fi.  Thought this one was neat.    urlLink Jeff Buckley :  urlLink  Lilac Wine     I lost myself on a cool damp night Gave myself in that misty light Was hypnotized by a strange delight Under a lilac tree I made wine from the lilac tree Put my heart in its recipe It makes me see what I want to see and be what I want to be When I think more than I want to think Do things I never should do I drink much more that I ought to drink Because (it) brings me back you...  Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love Listen to me... I cannot see clearly Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?  Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love? Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?  Listen to me, why is everything so hazy? Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?  Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love...  Inspired by Nina Simone's rendition.   Where did my Blog's title come from?  urlLink Futurama .  Fry and Amy hook up in an episode, and there's a line where they're talking, and Fry says something to the effect of "I feel like I can talk about all sorts of stuff and, you know, junk with you."  or something like that.  Exact quotes can't be recalled, deal.   Nina Simone-alikes Mentioned Nina Simone to my co-worker and she started in with "Booy, if you like you some Nina then you just might like..."  and started to name people like  urlLink Nat King Cole ,  urlLink Miles Davis , urlLink Harry Belafonte ,  urlLink Lena Horne , and others.  I'll have to get myself a sampling of some of this.   Dark Materia  urlLink Dark Materia's   urlLink Audio  section: The Picard Song.  It's just wow.  Of relevance, maybe, Materia was the name of various power stones in Final Fantasy VII that could be implanted into weapons or armor and imbue new abilities and teach the bearer magic or skills.  Not sure if this is the source of Dark Materia's name, but, hey, hearsay and guesstimation is just as good as truth in today's world.   Post title:   rand()  , the  urlLink C++ function  to generate a random number.  Yeah, I think thats enough for now.

      There's a series of games that has been out for awhile, whose story lines are top notch original.  I haven't ever actually beaten any of them, but I've watched my bud Cory play through some of 'em.  So I decided to put an end to that and play the Legacy of Kain / Soul Reaver series out.  I'm currently on Blood Omen 2 and really really liking it.  Game play is good, but you do it for the story -- oh, and for the stealth kills.  Seriously, I've spent like 10 minutes leading a victim around until I could get a stealth kill off on 'em, they're that fun, or I'm that lame -- take your pick.  After the events in Blood Omen 2, Soul Reaver 1 & 2 occur, then finally Blood Omen 3 / Soul Reaver 3.  I put the slash there as both games are the same game.  It's called Legacy of Kain: Defiance (and as such is technically Blood Omen 3), however in the game you play through as both Kain  and  Rahziel, and it effectively ties up both series', so there.  What else, oh, Magic.  Leagued with Jess -- there's probably a law against how much shit one individual can rip of another’s, and if so I had to have broken it.  I'm talking shotgun to the steak and taters level of fucked up here.  But  I don't gloat, it's unbecoming.  I was off on Tuesday and Wednesday, and boy howdy did I abuse those days.  I woke up at 15:30 or so on Tuesday, after having gone to slumber at 02:30ish that morn.  Yes that is right I slept 13 hours, and it felt flipping wonderful.  I started playing Blood Omen 2 at about 16:00, and finally decided I should go to bed when I noticed the sun was going to be actually rising.  There were occasional breaks of, you know, bodily functions and stuff.  I believe I may have even consumed some sort of foodstuff, maybe.  Wednesday, after a short six hour nap I arose at the halfway mark between noon and one.  I spent most of the time between then and about 15:30 reading the  urlLink SRD  and updating my DnD character to 3.5, which is especially cumbersome because he's a Psychic Warrior, and with the release of the Expanded Psionics Handbook (Psionics 3.5) they've  totally revamped.  Maybe I'll post 'em here, who knows.  But then, I traveled into the outside world, to the land of Rave (our local movie-hut) and purchased 4 tickets for Spiderman 2, which I enjoyed immenenemin, immensismas, ememinims -- a whole lot.  I won't post any spoilers, although I do want to take a moment to talk about one thing in particular.  So if you don't want to hear anything about the movie because you haven't seen it yet, do not read the rest of this paragraph, or poke your eyes out, whichever you prefer.  I'll give you a moment.  Hmm.  Hmmm hmmm.  Now that that business is concluded lets continue: the Octavius hospital scene.  When you see the movie, see if you'll agree with my sentiments here.  The Octavius hospital scene seemed out of place.  It wasn't bad, or in bad taste, to me at least.  Just that the way the filmed it, stylistically, seemed out of sorts with the way they presented the rest of the film.  I'm wondering if it was intentional, and if so was it meant to cause evocation of certain emotion?  Which emotion?  That’s all I got to say about that.  I think I'm going to start a trend in my posts and announce where the post title for that post came from.  If you read the other posts, their post titles are often non-sensical, unrelated.  This is by design, usually, and by chaos mostly.  To kick it off, this posts title of  Monorail!  stems from Simpson’s episode:  urlLink Marge vs. the Monorail , a musical number where a song about a Monorail happens.
