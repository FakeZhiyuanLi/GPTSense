      word of the day: successories. plural. as in, "anyone caught buying anything from a catalogue titled 'Successories' shall be drop-kicked" oh, you want an example of the trite and stupid things one may find in "Successories"? here's one: Framed photograph of a lovely garden with caption that reads, "Customer Care" and little words underneath it reading, "View all customers as beautiful gardens that must be cultivated and watered frequently. They're worth it." wtf. also: the back of the catalogue advertises Customer Service Week. It's just so... stupid. enough on that. waste of my time, damnit.  it's lunchtime here at my invigorating place of work. i've eaten a lovely tuna sandwich and the best yogurt there is: Tillamook mountain huckleberry. Those 'mookies sure make the best dairy i've ever had.  On my agenda today after lunch: 1. 2. 3. And then i get to go home. YESSSSS!  After a yummy dinner full of pasta, you betcha i'm going to go work out (24hour fitness is where we make it happen). My time spent there is usually all well and good, but I am not excited about another week of facing assman. For those of you that are not aware, "Assman" is the name i use for one specific ass. It is NOT, as some ass-lookers might think, an endearing term. i use it for the man who looks like a beef-cake (and is BALD HA HA HA HA!!) and acts like all women would willingly suck his cock. yes, folks, that IS what i said. Strutting around the gym, using approximately 20 minutes out of the five hours he spends there to actually WORK OUT, and speaking in a high voice are also all things that do not earn points. he's not my fave, peeps.  I'm trying to assess anything positive that might happen today. so far, eating and working out win. it's a drizzly, dark Oregon summer day, and it makes me grumpy.    Another assessment:  After giving myself full reign of what to write AND a blank page, i still am not satisfied with the content.  It's just another reminder that i really don't have much to go on these days.  Sigh.  I intend to change all that.

      word of the day: ruffian it's imperative that you use this word at least twice today. Why? my rule.  this blog is entirely intended for ME to keep up with MYSELF. For those who happen upon me, i offer no apologies for boring you... just remember that it's you that's wasting your time--which you'll never get back.. get it?  i feel better already. there's nothing better in the world than finding the outlet i've been hunting for. why didn't i know about these before? blogs, that is. i think that one of two things must have happened: 1: I've been living among illiterate, ignorant people for the past five years.  (example: my sketchy use of the word "among".  i think: is it "among" or "amongst"?  why use it at all?  i dunno)  2: Everyone knows about blogs and somehow i stuck my head in the ground about them. i think that it is the latter. someday i should make a "things-everyone-knew-about-but-i-just-found-out" list. the list would be long, folks, but would be damn funny.  that said, i have great expectations for myself in this particular arena. i have a desperate need to exercise the words...my being articulate no longer exists.. in fact, much of the day is spent trying to keep myself from opening my mouth and uttering "aaeeheuuugh" in liu of words. just so you get a glimpse. this is why i have a 'word of the day'. that way, i can guarantee myself that i will know what to do with at least one word a day.  with that, i'm out.
