        And I think it's gonna be a long long time Till touch down brings me round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh no no no I'm a rocket man Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone   Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids In fact it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them if you did And all this science I don't understand It's just my job five days a week A rocket man, a rocket man  Elton John

      If  I had to describe the people im my life in one word  this would be it.   Donny::   completion (Donny always complets what he sets out to do)   Kim K::    Forever      ( But just looking at her breifly you can tell her love for my best friend is forever..)   Joe::   friend    If anyone deserves this title its him.. He has stuck with me through some of the toughest times of my life and although sometimes he wants to strangle me. I know he will always be my friend.   Brian::    dedication..   it takes someone who has dedication to be a farmer. More work then I'll ever do. Also takes dedication to be joes friend for over a decade and not have killed himself. :-)   Brad:: Immortal.. The man must be. for someone who has been shot with a 12 guage run over several times electricuted with enough volts to drop a T-rex and keeps moving. I also chose immortal because where ever I end up I was always remember him.   Kat:: (young) Theres something about kat in that she never let this childish humor of herself go.. I don't mean this in a bad way. I only wish I could have kept the imagination she holds.   Rebecca:: (past) somone who I will always love. I could never date her again and she would tell you the same. Shes the mother of my child my first real love. somone who should best remain in  the past.   Ayla::(wonder) In my eyes shes the most magnificent child I have ever seen so smart so innocent.  I wish I was a better father. I wish I was with her more. But I have no one to blame but myself   Ed:: ying-yang  One of my best friends and some one I sometimes hate. Hes always tell me what hes thinking even if I don't wanna hear it. I've known ed since I was little I know he was always be there for me to tell me how it is.   I will ad to this as time goes on its not complete nor is it finsihed  :-p

       &nbsp;When I think of heaven    (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)   I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathersand all other instruments of faith and sex and God    In the belly of a black-winged bird   Don't try to feed me   I've been here before and I deserve a little more   I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between   She's been crying I've been thinking    And I am the Rain King   Mama, why am I so alone?I can't go outside   I'm scared I might not make it home   I'm alive but I'm sinking in   If there's anyone at home at your place   Why don't you invite me in   Don't try to bleed meI've been there before and I deserve a little more   I belong in the service of the Queen   I belong anywhere but in between   She's been lyingI've been sinking   And I am the Rain King   Hey,   &nbsp;I only want the same as anyone   Henderson is waiting for the sun   Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends   After all the dreaming I come home again..   .When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)   I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather   Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged bird   Don't try to bleed me   I've been here before and I deserve a little more   I belong in the service of the Queen   I belong anywhere but in between   She's been dyingI been drinking and I am the Rain King.

      All through my lives I've been kings and theives I've been killed and a killer I loved and I lost I have always been a protector, I was always the one in charge Always guarding the ones  that couldn't control  who they were, been or going to be I have always been there to let people cry on my shoulder. I can't help myself who I'm becoming I have always been stronger, stronger then everyone but myself.  (circa 1999)

      There in the woods hidden from all you kissed me the fire from camp gleamed in your eye and I knew  right then I could love you. The pain of my betrayl stung deep Lancelot was I,  but my heart drums me further. As the sun arose to that misty day I held you and I so wished to any that could hear my thoughts to stop time to let this last forever.  I though of him mostly that early morning as I feel asleep in my bed a friend I so betrayed. And I dreamed of you my gothic angel my women in the shadows.  In a different world in a different time....

      Remember when  We'd talk in the rain for hours we were so young I swear I could make time stand still looking into your eyes  Remember when   we were in love  Remember when  You were the first I truly loved and so was I  Rememebr when  There was joy there was hurt  Remember when  Childhood died for us and began for another  Remember when  She was so beautiful her parents so young  Remember when  I left so far away  Remember when  I came back we came togeter we fell apart  Remember when  She graduated her kindergarden year.  Remember when  we said well never be together again  Remember when......

      For so many of us love is just a feeling we feel when touched. or looked at or held. Or its a memeory box of someone who said good by. or a picture of some one who died Only one thing ties them togetehr      Always  Love is Always strong  It knows no limits It knows no restraints It will always be there no matter what It will always understand It can make you stand up against any odds even if you know you'll lose  But love will always be fragile  It can be destroyed It must not be lied to it must not be shared the same with anyone It can break anyone down  The Line between Love and hate is a thin line strong may it be. Easy it may fall.

I could no longer stand the fact everyone was better then I. With my stories my poems sometimes my pen was my only friend So in my face I was told I will never be anyting so I might as well give up now."
