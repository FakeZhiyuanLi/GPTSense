        urlLink This is an excellent article  and it examines how to perform dynamic URL rewriting with Microsoft ASP.NET. URL rewriting is the process of intercepting an incoming Web request and automatically redirecting it to a different URL. Discusses the various techniques for implementing URL rewriting, and examines real-world scenarios of URL rewriting.

       I was discussing SOA implementation with a  urlLink friend  of mine this morning and he told me about the architecure that he is using to develop his application.And then I told him about how/what I think of SOA i.e. message oriented communicaiton,loose coupling, find/bind and exucute logic. He reffered me  urlLink Microsoft reference architecure at GotDotNet  based on SOA. SOA is really some thing that promises loosely coupled computing.Here it is a defination for  urlLink SOA .

       Last night i downloaded  urlLink MSDNTV  episode titled "Improving .NET Application Performance and Scalability". It was a real good stuff. There was a guy in the presentation "Ashish Babbar" of InfoSys india who did the breifing about this new guide at  urlLink Patterns and Practices  site.Part III of the guide is best suited for developers, it addresses performance issues related to Enterprise Services,Interop,ASp.Net Web Services, ADO.net, XML etc. I think its a must read for any serious developer, team lead and application architect.

       PDC 2004 was really a succesful event. Almost all the speakers were great specially  urlLink Rafal Lukawiecki , urlLink Clemens Vasters ,Gosking Baker and  urlLink Farhan Muhammad   impressed me the most (and I guess the whole crowd). I really enjoyed sessions on SOA, Threat Modeling,ADO.Net best practices, Web Application Security,Indigo, and MSF. During PDC I got to learn a lot about SOA, Threat Modeling. And Microsoft Solutions Framework is something that has found my interest.

         urlLink What is a Service-Oriented Architecture?     A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a component model that inter-relates the different functional units of an application, called services, through well-defined interfaces and contracts between these services. The interface is defined in a neutral manner that should be independent of the hardware platform, the operating system, and the programming language the service is implemented in. This allows services, built on a variety of such systems, to interact with each other in a uniform and universal manner     for more details visit :  urlLink http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/newto/

       Yesterday our UG had a session on "Enterprise Services (COM+) with .Net". 9-10 people attended the session. Syed Ata Hussain was the speaker for the event and he introduced COM/COM+ in .Net and then drilled down in COM+ with an example. It was a knowledgable session. I presented Syed Ata Hussain a book on ASP.Net Web Matrix as a gift from our UG.

       These days I am in a fix over use of O/R Mapping and Domain Objects and how do they fit into Enterprise Scale Application development scenario. When I asked this thing to  urlLink Clemens Vasters , he said the following things:-       &nbsp;    you might want to consider the following questions:  &nbsp;  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How effective is O/R mapping when you don’t look at single objects but rather need to fetch sets of data (assume the price history for a stock) based on certain criteria such as a certain time period?  b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you integrate with transactions and how do you assure that you are in control of the order and locking hints of insert/update operations to minimize deadlocks/lock contention?  c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How tight is the coupling between your relational model and your objects? Can you change the table layout and indexing of the data store flexibly as your data volumes change?  d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you effectively hide the database detail implementation and provide a “secure gateway” into the database using a layer of stored procedures and views?  e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How tight is the coupling between your business code and the underlying data store technology? Are you bound to a certain database product or even product version?  f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the net efficiency gain that O/R mapping gives you in development? Is it actually making developers more productive in creating *and maintaining* your software or is it merely “more elegant”?  &nbsp;  I am not sure that O/R mapping technology scores very favorably in many of those considerations.  &nbsp;  Best Regards  Clemens Vasters          &nbsp;  SO things arent getting clearer here . And I am back to my drawing board and scratching my head !  &nbsp;

       So we are in for our second meeting. Which is scheduled for coming week.&nbsp; I need to seek your advice/suggestions on following things.  &nbsp;   Meeting Day:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We have three suggestions (along with their reasons) so far:  &nbsp;   &nbsp;Wednesday: (Its a mid-week so we are not much burdened with the work neither because of start of the week nor because of its end , as is the case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Friday.)  &nbsp;Friday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Its a week-end so every one can stay till a little late since there isn't any working day next morning.)  &nbsp;Saturday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Its&nbsp;usually an&nbsp;off-day and every one can spare 1-2 hours )  &nbsp;  So we need to decide one of the 3 choices. I personally feel comfortable with Wed/Friday.  &nbsp;   Topic: (Discussion)   &nbsp;   Application Frameworks .  COM+ (Enterprise Services).  Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  XML Web Services.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For the coming week I would suggest Enterprise Services.&nbsp; &nbsp;

       &nbsp;  Rather than being annoyed, be amused.   Instead of getting angry, become curious.   In place of envy, feel admiration.   In place of worry, take action.   In place of doubt, have faith . &nbsp; Negative energy is just positive energythat's flowing in the opposite direction.There's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy.&nbsp; All you need to do is change its direction.The more negative you are, the more positive you can be.An automobile that can travel 70 miles per hour to the east... can also travel just as fast when going west.But first, someone must turn it around.When you sense yourself becoming negative, stop and consider what it would mean to apply thatnegative energy in the opposite direction.Turn your sadness into caring. Transform your complaints intouseful suggestions. Change your bitterness intodetermination. The energy is already there,All you need to do is change its direction.

        C# Exception Specs    urlLink Why doesn't C# have exception specifications?  Some languages allow or require member signatures to include exception specifications. For example, in a language with such a construct, a method that raises an ArgumentException can be declared with:  void DoSomething(int a) throws ArgumentException {...}    C# neither requires nor allows such exception specifications.  There are a number of reasons for this omission, namely:   Versioning  Productivity and code quality  Impracticality of having class author differentiate between "checked" and "unchecked" exceptions  Difficulty of determining the correct exceptions for interfaces.

       Now a days i am working on a data fetch utility that fetches data from remote locations and then stores the fetched data to a centralized location. this is pretty much of a trivial task so not much science in it. however thats not the end, i also need to backup the fetched database every time the application is run.thats where i stopped. so i searched on the internet to find C# code for backing up a database and i found this  urlLink real cool piece of code . Now i m using the same code with a little bit of customization (read parametrization) in my application. Thanks to the author of  urlLink code .

       You can use "Application.CurrentCulture" to set  these settings.    To keep it simple you can do it like :   Application.CurrentCulture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(new  System.Configuration.AppSettingsReader().GetValue("ur-PK",typeof(string)).ToString() );     Or if you want to parameterize it then you may use the following:   In the following snippet I have defined my culture settings in a config file. The tag goes like this :   add key="ApplicationCulture" value="ur-PK"   private void setCurrentCultureInfo(){  /// set ur culture information here. Application.CurrentCulture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(new  System.Configuration.AppSettingsReader().GetValue("ApplicationCulture",typeof(string)).ToString() );  Application.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat = System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.CurrentInfo;  }

       I had to speak on 3 different occassions and on 3 different topics last weekend. Firstly, on Firday evening I had to present  urlLink "ADO.Net Best Practices"  at  urlLink Mohammad Ali Jinnah University . And then on Saturday afternoon there was an event on " urlLink .Net Framework " at  urlLink Sir Syed University Of Engineering and Technology . Event at SSUET was followed by a regular class at  urlLink Karachi University . For now i will talk about SSUET event. Event at Sir Syed University went good. I was told that some 200 people attended it. I think they all had a good time and so did I. Although the event started a bit late (well quite a bit, some 50 mins to be exact 8-/ ), but it ended well. Usually  SSUET audience is "JAVA PRO" but preaching .Net to them was somewhat fun. Specially the Q&A session was good, it was kind of fun to answer their questions. Presentation will be made available online soon at  urlLink INETA/MEA web site .
