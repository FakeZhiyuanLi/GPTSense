      Hit it harder than I ever have before today.  30 minutes on the stationary bike, and while it was only 30 I worked it hard, staying at 100 rpm for the entire duration.  The resistance was also put up the entire way.  All in all a great workout there.  Then I ran immediately after.  More than anything the issue is getting the blood out of your quads into the rest of your body.  But it honestly felt great.  My muscle stamina isn't the hard part at this point, it is my heart endurance.  I need to keep building up my heart.  But today honestly was the first day that I thought to myself...you can do this Ryan.    I need to stay focused on this and not let outside influences, moving, work, etc get in the way of this goal.  I need to make this training a training for life, but not only that a training for the rest of my life.  I need to teach myself my discipline once again...and more than anything...beat this sonofabitch.

      Okay so running kills me.  Went to 24 - lifted a bit and then ran.  Killed me I dont know why.  Not winded but just coulding keep going.  Not that happy with myself.  Need to push it much harder if I am going to do tnhis.

      Today was one of the best swimming days.  I finally felt that I was able to pick up a stride - so to speak - in my swimming.  It is finally starting to hit me how hard my goal is...but really how well worth it it truely is as well.  What draws me to it is how hard it is.  How incredibly difficult what I want to do is.  Can I do it...I know I can.  I have to know that I can...  I think I am going to try and take Wednesday off and then swim again on Thursday.  Stay posted...  :)

      I was busy the past few days and haven't been able to write.  My friend helped me out the other night with my swimming technique - or complete lackthereof.  I have never used that many muscles in my entire life - the little muscles that you don't even think of using, well I had to use them there.  I started out on yes - I kick board.  Quite possibly the most embarrassing thing of my entire life - sitting there on a kick board.  Having him look at my legs kick.  I can tell you that I never want to deal with that again.  Next it was the arms.  It is amazing how inefficient my strokes were.  Sheesh.  But its going good.  I just need to focus my efforts on the run - because that is what is going to kill me.  I am going to be running more tonight....keep tuned.  Its funny I know no one else is reading this - oh well.  :)

      I hate treadmills.  I don't know why I hate them so much but they are just plain awful. It hurts my legs so.  I am starting to get a slight shin splint.  Its not that bad..just a different pain for me.  A nagging pain.  Its just something that I really am not used to.  More used to acute pain.  Broken bones etc.  This dull pain is like having an acorn in my shin.  I think the thing I need to do is well get more comfortable shoes.  Bigger shoes that are nice and cushy...thats right I said cushy.  Lets see on the treadmill from hell I ran 30:00 minutes at a 5.5-6.0 mph mace.  The pace was fine but the shin slowed me considerably.  Tomorrow is the big swimming day.  Its only 30 minutes and then I will ride the bike after.  But who knows how it will turn out.  Actually I will do great.  I have to do great.  I decided to do this and goddamned I will make it out of it.  :)  I will make it out of it better than ever.

      Its incredible after a night of partying - the first in a long while - how you have ablsoultly no desire to move let alone train for the event...but it was worth it!  Great seeing everyone and my friends at the graduation.  I guess I can use this to gauge how much weight I will be losing too.  I am thinking I will drop about 10...I hope I dont lose too much.

      It's a Saturday.  I am getting ready for my good friends graduation from UW.  Things have been good but something is lacking...So I decide to train for a triathalon.  Crazy?  Yes...but hey I can do it right.  I have been getting back into shape..nothing like when I was in college though.  Tomorrow I am planning on riding the bike for about 45 and running for about 20!  We will also see what happens when I try try to finish the swim!    Keep you all posted on how I do my training and my thoughts...Also you all must read the Lance Armstrong Biography.  One word that comes to mind is powerful...that is all I can say about Lance Armstrong - just an amazingly powerful and inspirational person.    Why the heck am I keeping a blog of this anyways?  Gezz I am nuts.
