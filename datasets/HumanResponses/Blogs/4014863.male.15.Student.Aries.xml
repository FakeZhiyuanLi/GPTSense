       Last night as I was coming home from the "festivities" I noticed a rather dim street light (ooh awe) anyway, I then decided to give it some attention. I told it "come on get bright" (in a nice tone mind you) and gestured to it "come on" and it got a little brighter. And i'm like: (ok that was cool). so i did it again same thing it got brighter. which I thought was cool. Other than that it was an uneventful night.

        People have wondered why it is that I don't go outside.   Now I can answer them! All my life between being raised in downtown kelowna to Mindy Trann's kidnapping, to my less than sane father and being a fair skin blonde (kidnapper's favorite target)  I WAS TRAINED TO AVOID OUTSIDE!  so now maybe people will understand why I don't go outside!   And leave me alone!&nbsp;   That settles it eh?

         How Unique! I now have a blog...  like everyone else.   but mine is unique and creative cause i said so! Nyeh! Here is where I stand: The meaning of life is 42, it takes 10 licks to get to the centre of that damn popsicle stick, The spatula is in fact a top-secret mind controlling device, Penguins exist and mine is named BOB!  that's about it for knowledge that isn't common and....I am da King-O-Pants!

       Well needless to say i'm still gonna lend out my single shirt because others may need companionship more than I do. For those who were looking forward to me updating i'm sorry... i officially say only certain people i'll answer to what i've done or anything like that, the people i think i'll let ask, are Brianna if she cares to know, or Geoffrey if it actually won't hurt him to hear it. My diary entries are kinda sad i think that i actually loved her, I hate anyone who thinks i'm too young to love. There is so much i want to tell her but i lack the words. She is the first person I could close my eyes and see not even family can i picture as crystalline in my mind. I'll wait for that someday... that infinite tommorrow, that I may one day hold her in my arms and she would share the same sentiment. I feel so impure, digging up long buried secrets, that none but her and I now know. If you are reading this don't tell her about it not even a breath. I still wish to sing her the song that i can't listen to without thinking of her. Only the above may ask what song that is... though my song for now is "this time imperfect" by AFI. that's all i can truly say. *signing off*     -Ty

      Hello i'm back, because i have something actually worth writing! ( On a side note i'm renting out the single shirt  ). I have found the first girl that no one has forced a relationship on me or bugged me about incessantly(plus she's cute to boot)! I must thank those who made it possible... brianna who very bodily threw me at her and grabbed my arm and put it around her, as well as telling me she actually liked me too... that was handy that's it for thanks. Other than that i'm still generally alive so to speak and well..... that's about listen to placebo good band..... that's it.

       Hey i just got back from laying low. I was at the parksville carshow and for stating the obvious i got over 50$ worth of stuff! so for all of those people that complain about my stating of obvious things HA and Phoey! the details of the story are as follows: there was a person who won an award for the best tractor there and the announcer asked what makes you think this guy is a tractor driver when you first see him? i looked at the guy looked almost boring nothing special green cap, white shirt jeans nothing fancy.... and i yelled at the guy " it's the hat!" and he said, "what about the hat" and I was the only person who said It has a tractor logo on it!(john deere tractors ltd.) it was so stupidly obvious and now i have some professional grade chains for my bike, new grips, extra strong torque tube for my tire and the knowledge that stupidly obvious things aren't!
