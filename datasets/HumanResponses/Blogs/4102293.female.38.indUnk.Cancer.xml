       I've had migraines for the past couple of days.  The one I have now is trying to go away.  Guess I just need more sleep to get rid of it.  Sleep - it's what I do best.  I've stopped taking my paxil...don't ask my why, I just have.  Maybe part of the reason is that I'm up for disability review and I'm scared they will say I'm ready to go back to work, which I'm not.  I need more therapy especially since I haven't gotten any over the past year.  I've figured out the stuff that's upsetting me - stuff I don't want to post here just yet 'cause I'm afraid I'll be laughed at.  Technically it all goes back to being adopted.  I really hate being adopted...it's been no picnic even though people think I'm so blessed to have been wanted by a family.  Yeah?  Well, the family that adopted me took me just because they wanted another baby - a girl - in their family.  They didn't pick me for me; they picked me because I was a baby.  I don't fit in with my family at all and you can tell that just by looking at me.  I'm so Irish-looking that it's not funny whereas the rest of my family is all darker hair with darker skin.  My personality doesn't fit theirs either.  I'm so much more vocal than they are.  Especially my one brother - the other adopted child.  He's so passive and such a mama's boy that I can't stand it.  He never created a fuss like I did and he hates me for all the fusses I put up.  He once told me to go to hell in front of my parents and they didn't reprimand him or anything.  Mom has always sided with my 2 brothers.  I was the trouble-maker and they were the goody-2-shoes boys.  I'm angry at my bmom for giving me up.  That's where it all starts....      Later, -daria-

       Daddy is talking about getting his Ph.D. degree.  I know he enjoys learning and getting an education but he barely has time for life now let alone if he'd go back to school.  What's going to happen to me, is all I'm wondering.  I know I shouldn't complain because I'm going back to college in September but my classes will be easy compared to his Ph.D. classes.  I'm afraid I'm going to get lost in the shuffle and that I won't see him as much as I do now, or that I won't be able to talk with him every night like I do now.  With his work, he'll have to take night classes so when will he have time for me?  I asked him about it and he said nothing will change but.....he can't promise that.        Sometimes I wish I wasn't so afraid to tell him how I really feel about him.  I'm afraid because what if I open my heart up to him but he doesn't want it?...he doesn't want to hear how I really feel?  I'm too afraid of being pushed away *and* pushing him away with what I might say.  In my dreams, I always hope that I'll be able to open up to him and that he'll accept me.  Damn those rose-colored glasses.

       So I was looking in the Sunday paper and of course I read the obituaries.  I found out that earlier this week a woman I had worked with passed away.  I was shocked.  She was only 61.  I worked with her at an insurance agency and for the most part I liked her and got along with her.  She had cancer and she died at home.  I hope she is at peace now.  It's funny because I was thinking about her earlier this week.  I actually thought of giving her a call even though I hadn't talked with her in years.  She impacted many lives and she will be very missed.      Whenever someone I know of dies, I feel such a strong loss.  I hate feeling that way.  I know that part of the reason that I feel so strongly is because I sort of envy those people who have gone before me.  They are finally resting at peace and that's what I long for.  I believe in Heaven, and I believe Heaven is a place of beauty as well as a plac e where there are no more hurts.  I imagine it is a place where there are no judgments made of others that are there.  I so long to be free of judgments.      I guess that's all I'm going to write for now.  I don't want to get into things any deeper than with what I've already said.       Peace   -daria-

       I've been fighting sleep lately and tonight is one of those nights where I'm doing just that.  Of course, it doesn't help that I spent most of today in bed.  I was so tired today and I think I'm getting a cold.  My cable got turned off today so that's also most likely contributing to my lack of being able to sleep.  I hate when things get turned off.  I was told by my roommate that he paid bills but it seems they haven't been paid in 3 months.  I'm learning I can't trust my roommate.      My roommate is my husband although we are separated.  It was just easier for both of us to continue living together for financial reasons.  He dates and I date.  Strange relationship maybe, but it works for us...for now.  He just got a job and starts on Monday so hopefully after some time, we can begin our divorce proceedings.  My boyfriend is an attorney and he'll probably do our divorce for us for just the court costs.  I feel so bad that my marriage didn't last a lifetime but what can you do when two people simply grow apart?  I will always care about my husband, though.  You don't live with someone for 13 years and just stop caring for them, you know?  I don't care too much for my roommate's girlfriend.  She's a big dumb blonde who is goofy looking, at least that's why my boyfriend says about her.  She goes through money like it's water, and she spends even when she shouldn't be spending.  She treats my roommate like shit sometimes and I let him know when I think she's doing that to him.  He's too good of a guy to be treated the way she treats him at times.      So, M, my boyfriend is an attorney.  He's also a fighter pilot.  And, he's also my Daddy and I'm his submissive.  I treasure my relationship with him very much; he's been a wonderful gift in my life.  Hopefully after the first of the year, we'll be living together.  At least, that's when I told him I wanted to be out of here by - the first of the year.  M and I live 2 1/2 hours away from each other which isn't that bad.  I like the drive out to where he lives and compared to where I live, there is so much more to do where he is.  I worry about him everyday and I look forward to our nightly talks on the phone.  Sometimes I wonder if I tell him that I appreciate him enough.  I want him to know how special he is to me but I don't want to smother him at the same time.      I guess I'll try to go back to sleep now.  The eyelids are getting heavy again.  ~yawning~
