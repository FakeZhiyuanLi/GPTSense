      To start off the me vs. myself blog was meant to be humorous, not me admitting my insanity. I would never do such a thing.  So, yesterday I spent the whole day programming and thouroughly enjoyed my day at work. This has confirmed what I need to b e doing the rest of my life.  Today though, I am confronted with a dishwasher. You see, we have 2 dish washers. Ive only been using one. Stuff was piled in front of th other. So I move the pile and open it. I am greeted with with 3 inches of water falling out of the dishwasher about 6 months old. Imagine a Brown, white, green film of mold over the top falling out onto the floor for me to clean up. The smell was even better! SO, I eventually soak up all the water and remove the filter in the dishwasher to find paper and whatnot blocking the drain. Turns out some assclown saw that the dishwasher had flooded, shut the door, and left it for 6 months.  Now that that's off my chest, heres another little fact about me.  Yes, it's true I have a hard time saying no. Everyones told me. But is it really so bad to do something  for somebody. My thought process always comes up with an excuse to make me feel good about my decision. I mean I do make decisions to help within reason, i wont just give somebody my left thyroid if they asked me for it. And I am getting better at saying no in the right situations. For example I used to do computer work to help people for free. Now, unless you are family or close friends, I charge 50$/hour for computer repair, 75$/hour for Infrastructure setup, and 90$/hr for programming. Isn't funny how nobody wants my help anymore :)

      Argument:  ALRIGHT A$$FACE. What the hell is wrong with you? You eat out like a dike at a lesbian convention.(not that theres anything wrong with that). You piss your money away on illuminated keyboards when in fact your gargantuan monitor is so damn bright that you cant see it anyways. AND WHY THE HELL WERE YOU SOOO IMPATIENT ON BUYING THAT CAR. I mean it's not like they are paying you crap at work. LAZY ASS LAZY ASS LAZY ASS LAZY ASS LAZY ASS. FIND A NEW JOB SCHMUCK.   Thats about all that's wrong with you.  Rebuttle:  Yeah, I know.

      I figure, if I don't start planning the next big step in my career, then I will end up 20 years from now stuck at some place like KDC. I'm REALLY good at taking the first step. I keep getting discouraged around step 3 or 4 and then stumble around like a drunken fool until I pass out and wake up when I'm 40 and not content with my career choices. Sooo how will I fix this....hmmm....Well after thinking about I realized all the first steps were all wrong. I wanted to take a step but I had no clue where I was going. So for the record, I need and idea. Next I need a Plan. Next I need support. Next I need to design. Next I need to develop. Next i need to Test. Next I need to Deploy/Sell.  If you havent figured it out yet, my goals are to go into business for myself in the software business. I'm tired of my boss renting me out at 100$ /hr and i see a small fraction of that.  So, here I go back to step one.

      Happy Friday,  Many have noticed that I tend to let things go easily. I do, this is no lie. It comes down to this, I tend to let bad things go that happen because there is nothing I can do to change it. The only thing to get out of it is to not let it happen again. So next time something negative and non-drastic happens, understand immediately that  it's too late to stop it, just work on fixing it.  This leads to something people wonder about with me; Anger. People RARELY see me angry.  let's look at one of anger's instigators: Jealousy, for example.   My most meaningful ex-girlfriend started dating one of my friends. Yes, I was quite pissed for a week. Then I started talking to them, and eventually hanging out with them. I'd estimate 95% of people out there would not accept this as normal behavior, but rather as torture. My answer is related my ability to let things go easily. Not that I don't care, but, I figure this: We broke up for good reasons. If I were to go start a war, it would make me no happier just more and more hateful as anger was exchanged. So my advice to anyone in a anger situation is to walk away. Or in my case, just accept what is and that fighting it would in no way benefit me.  I guess it all comes down to this belief I have: the only people I have a right to punish in this world are myself and my kids.    Well that covers anger, and why it's so rare with me.  Ok roomies, there is no oops god. I simply accept what happens immediatly rather than getting angry over it and prolonging the problem.  Have a weekend

      Ok, call me whacked in the head, but I got hired as the IT guy. The last time I've done anything remotely related was two weeks ago. Since then I've been:  A) Reconciling our American express Statements B) Doing the dishes in a dishwasher that is broken. C) Mopping our kitchen because it flooded because people put large objects in the       disposal D) organizing the storage room. E) taking care of our plants. F) This. G) Planning to find a new job where I'm not the office Bitch.  My job's turned into about 80% catering/maintenance and about 20% IT. I vote that I should move on.  Ah yes, I just remembered why NOONE should work for a small business. ALL OF YOU HEAR ME? DON'T DO IT! Sometimes we're better off being just a number in a large corporation.  That's all I have to say about that.

      Ever ask yourself, "What the hell is Dave thinking?" Well here is where you'll find out. You see, a LOT of things go through my head in a day. I tend to zone out as lot as a result. So, here is where you'll get the answer to why you had to repeat yourself 3 times before I acknowledged the Earth around me actually existed.   Oh, and yes you know my mind is elsewhere when I respond to you in a mumble.  One other thing about me is that I have concluded that I can do two complex tasks at one time. Sometimes three, but usually two. SO thinking and working is about it. Don't expect a clear response out of me while im working. Now, things get complicated when I'm doing two things at the same time that do not involve my brain. Because when queried by another individual during this moment, many disasters may occur. For example driving my car. I can drive my car and talk on the phone at the same time. But, the second the back-seat driver kicks in, that third job will result in:  A) A completely useless response such as, "Cardboard", or "Rammstein" B) I give you the time of day and run a red light resulting in crashing or vehicular       manslaughter. C) You get lucky and catch me in one of those 3 things at a time moments.  Well theres the mystery of the day about Dave. Check back tomarrow for more about what the hell is going on with me.  Dave

      &nbsp; Well recently I&nbsp;started the High Carb diet. I'm saving soooo much money now! Also I finished my resume and cover letter template so I'm ready to start the job hunt. As far as starting my thing goes, it's happening, just a bit slow. Lot's to learn. &nbsp; I get to go back to Columbus next Sunday. At least I won't be sick. I forgot I had a ticket to the Cure sunday. That's gone now since I fly out then. But when I get to columbus I'm eating steaks EVERY night for the sacrifices I have made to go up there for work. I'm going to miss the El Nino we've been having down here. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ah yes here I am in not so sunny Columbus, Ohio where im running the facility for a week. Don't get me wrong, it's kind of nice up here. But not as many pluses as florida. But it's always fun to go somewhere semi-new for a little bit on the company card.  One observation up here are the girls. They don't always check me out like they do in florida. Of course I'm joking. Maybe it's my hairy neck cause i need a haircut. Well ones thing for sure...I DONT LIKE EM! Now that I think of it. Very few people up here are in a  good mood. glad i didnt move here.  Strange how I don't like to ask a lot of people. And that most of the facility manager job is asking people to do things for you. Not sure if that's the job for me.  Holy crap get this, I found out why I'm gaining weight....It's because I eat too friggin much.  I don't make enough money to exercise.  I think that's it for now.
