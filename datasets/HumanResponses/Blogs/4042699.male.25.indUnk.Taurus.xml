      Sorry I haven't posted much yet.  I've been mezmerized by the DNC speeches.  Its about time we heard the truth about what needs to be done for a more prosperous America.  First, we need to defeat the evil George W. Bush and try him for crimes against humanity.  Then, we need to reverse the trend of selfishness that has destroyed the true spirit of this nation since Repukelicans started taking over.  Government has to make sure that everybody is cared for, insteaad of leaving them to die in back alleys because they were too poor to pay for a safe abortion and they couoldn't feed the baby they were going to have, and the baby was going to be a mutant because AWOL's corporate cronies polluted the atmosphere.    Let America be America again!  Go Kerry!!!

      I finally decided to start posting on  urlLink Democratic Underground.   It's the most intelligent discussion forum on the Internet!    I'm participating in a thread  urlLink here  right now.

      I'm tired of Republicanazis complaining about  urlLink this.   Just look at what Conservative Dumbass over at  urlLink Semi-Intelligent Thoughts      said about it:     That's the left for ya, so open-minded and tolerant of opposing viewpoints.     Hey, we're just as tolerant as anyone else, but since you facists on the Wrong Wing decided to go to war for oil against innocent brown people, theres no telling what youll do to defenseless Democrats.  Your always so worried about "homeland security," aren't you?  If you had your way, the Unpatriotic Act would put all dissenters in a cage anyway, so why are you complaining, hypocrit?    See what I used to deal with?

      It looks like John F. Kerry's wife is  urlLink standing up to the corporate media!   She told a reporter to shove it!  HA!  Serves you right for being mouthpieces for the B*sh fraudministration, you whores.  And if you're not convinced that Mrs. Kerry did the right thing, maybe Hillary Clinton can change you're mind:     Asked about the comment Monday on CNN's "American Morning," Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she believes that "a lot of Americans will say, 'Good for you -- you go girl.' And certainly that's how I feel about it."     Exactly!  The media keeps lieing and ignoring Bushhitler's deceptions, and they're already questioning JFK's patriotism, so of course they deserve what's coming to them!    We need more Real Americans like Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  The revolution is coming.

      Hi, everyone!  My name is Larry, and I'm a liberal (no relation to  urlLink Liberal Larry,  who is a genius).  I used to be a guest poster on a conservative blog called  urlLink Semi-Intelligent Thoughts,  but I was tired of the reich-wingers squashing my inteligent dissent, so I registered my own site, and now noone can stop me!    I'll be posting here on a regular basis to share the truth of the liberal point of view with the unenlightened masses. If you need more info about me, check my profile. I have to be careful how much information I give away, though. You never know when Attorney General Asscrap is reading your blog.
