      Monday, July 26, 2004 10:35 AM Update incorporating from 20th of July. I was speaking to a friend on Saturday; she is what you could call very “critical” or “intense”. She is typically very analytical of what is being said. Whilst speaking to her I noticed patterns to her eye movement. She would look down and to the left, I assume she was repeating what I had just said to her over in her head, the across to the left and come out with an answer.  Post Class notes from 21st July First things first, new room. The room has two screens and this makes it much harder to direct my attention, even though jack was only speaking to one of the screens I found my eyes inadvertently wandering across to the other side of the room. To put this into a sales context; I believe that keeping the customers attention goes further than what you say and do, it has much to do with environment.  Things I have learnt about Jack this week Jack has had a triple bypass; his wife’s name is Fran. He has a certain affection for BMWs, not sure if he owns one, but I agree that they are a beautiful car. Jack seems to be well travelled, he likes to learn the basics of other languages from students, and I believe he enjoys spending time in Bali.   Pearls Of Wisdom I am finding this class to be very handy for picking up pearls if wisdom and have begun to apply some of the things I have learnt. A couple to “Jackisms” if you will.  “Watch and listen twice as much as you talk” You have two eyes, two ears and one mouth, learn to use them as intended. I believe that this means you should be an attentive listener. Applying this to the subject, let the customer tell you what they want, listen to their needs, ask questions where appropriate but let them do most of the talking.   This leads me to the next thing I learnt. “Be artfully vague when asking for an opinion, be specific when asking for something” Applying this to the subject I will use an analogy learned in class. When asking to get the door of the class closed, Jack would select an individual to do so, but when asking for people to answer a question he would address it to the class.   “Manipulation is a good thing” In the right context, it is an ethical issue but manipulation used in the right way can be good for all parties.  “Charisma is something you do, not something you have” Bob hawk did charisma, people genuinely enjoyed being around him, very necessary if you are going to be a successful politician. This could also include that to develop a rapport with someone you don’t have to like them, but you must respect their opinions. “Respect another persons model of the world”.  People can only retain seven pieces of information +/- two at any given time. Ensure that when selling not to overload the client with information.  Random Fact People who have recently been let out of prison tend to shop at around 2am; it is assumed that this is because there are less people around.  The right to exercise choice as a Consumer While sitting down and discussing the goings on of our class, Darren and I experienced the right to exercise choice as a consumer. Whilst Darren’s order of a Hot chocolate was very simple, I exercised my right to choice and ordered a light soy, triple shot, decaf, vanilla, venti latte. This is a perfect example of choice.  I am beginning to think that this Journal is going to be a little longer than I first expected, have also turned it into a blog.

      Monday, July 26, 2004 Have noticed a lot of changes since beginning to take the selling and sales management class. Am picking up the vocab very quickly. Sat down and had a conversation with Darren the other day after class and the more we talked about the class the more I noticed it made sense. Will include a full summary of the week in the morning.  I have also decided to turn my journal into a blog, in case that wasn't obvious enough.

      Thursday, July 15, 2004 Had my first class today Jack was discussing how peoples eyes move and how to read how they are thinking. We watched a couple of people from class and how there eyes moved, using visual recollection, Visual construction among many.  Stopped for a coffee on my way home, speaking to Dino. He asked me ho my Mum was, looking up and to his left, hadn’t thought about what was said in class until then. It really works, makes it easy to get on somebody’s train of thought. Same thing happened while watching Leanne Rhymes on the Sharron Osbourne show. Leanne was looking both down to her left (self talk) and down to her right (emotional), she was also tilting her head which seemed to indicate she was thinking hard before answering.
