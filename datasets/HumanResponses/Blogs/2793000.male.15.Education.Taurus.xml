      Oh, hello. Did something happen? Bet on it, bucko. Yeah, that's right, I called you bucko. And you better believe it... and... er... live with it! Yeah....  Well, if you've stumbled in here, you're obviously looking for something.  Keep at that, why don't you.  However, if you came for the updater-whenever-he-feels-like-it adventures of darkshadows86's Unbeiliv-a-blog, then look no freakin' further.  Of course, that's when I actually have something to talk about. That's really not right now. but, if you must, go  urlLink here . It might be mildly amusing.    Working on: trying to get up the gumption to start www.unbeilivasite.tk . That'd be kickass.

      Welly frickin' well. I just realized that this blog was created 3 days before the real site's 2 year anniversary, which is tomorrow. There's your pointless information. I pushed the anniversary last year, but this year I haven't really said jack about it. Of course, ATM, no-one really reads this anyway right now. So most of what I post here right now doesn't matter. So I'm going to try my weak HTML editing here.  Mail me!   Did that work?

             People are overrated. I swear, I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  Making Mountains out of molehills seems to be the thing to do these days. One thing happens, and people will never forget it. I'm serious. In twenty years, what happens this very day may be brought up in a court of law. Or maybe just at the guillotine. Who cares?  Now listening to: The History of Battle (.mid) (A collection of Final Fantasy battle music, from I to IX) Now feeling: Like a weirdo

      Whoever claimed the Spring break had any sort of 'brak' in it was a lying dumbo.  Today, I have had the worst possible day. Stress,  urlLink Achaea , and a One Winged Angel (referring to the song from FF VII, tyvm.)  Current mood: distraught Music: The Final Fantasy battle theme. Again.

      Well, the reason I kinda cut off abruptly there was that, well, English was about to end, I didn't want to be late, y'know, the usual reasons. Anyway, Tomorrow, I have to wake up at the crack of dawn to go to the gayest thing ever: the ISSMA contest. It would be great to do this if I were still in middle school, were going with my old orchestra teacher, and it was optional. But nooooooooo.... I  have  to go - a mandatory, you - fail - if - you - don't affair - with the second best orchestra at the school (we're second best on a mere technicality - there are only two orchestras at the school I go to) and the wishiest, washiest conductor I have ever met. He couldn't control someone under a  dominate  spell, he's that bad.  At least it's all over at about 10:00 in the morning, which means I have enough time to take a bath, change out of my tuxedo they make us wear, grab my gaming books, and head off to Glendale mall for five hours of gaming heaven. Now, if only I can survive the first part of the day...  So, in closing, you're an idiot.  Sincerely, darkshadows86, Lord of the Underworld

      OMG! I, amazingly, was invited to join my H*R fan forum's AIM chatroom! I can't believe how lucky I am! It makes me feel like an accepted member of the community instead of a zombie follower...  Anydangway, I'm thinking of starting to be more like Strong Bad and start my own E-mail show! I have a place on Freewebs where I can do this, so you'll hear back from me about that soon.  So, in closing, you're an idiot.  Sincerely, darkshadows86, Lord of the Underworld
