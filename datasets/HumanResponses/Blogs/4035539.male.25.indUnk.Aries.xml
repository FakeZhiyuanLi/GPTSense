      Did you hear him?&nbsp; "No kidding...I was born in the west wing of the hospital."  Seemingly innocuous, but indicative of how Kerry sees himself, and has always seen himself: as a man destined to be president.&nbsp;   But John: destiny comes from God--you know, that "higher being" you claim as "the reason you're alive"?&nbsp; And when it comes to God, John, it's not about you.&nbsp; It's not about your accomplishments, your fame, your power.&nbsp; It's all about God.&nbsp; You think you're really that special, that God specially selected you to one day serve as leader of the free world?&nbsp; If such were true, John, you wouldn't have to beat us over the heads with the fact that you were born in the "west wing" of the hospital, that you served in Vietnam (complete with home video, nonetheless), that your initials are JFK.&nbsp;   Let your character do the talking, John.&nbsp; Or do you realize, deep inside, that it's not enough?

       urlLink http://www.drudgereport.com/dnc8.htm   This is why, on a personal level, most people instinctively dislike Kerry: he's been running for president since he popped out of the womb. Think about it: his initials, while I suppose he didn't choose them,&nbsp;have been exploited for political purposes; not only videotaping, but re-enacting his "heroism" on the battlefield; serving as a prosecutor for just long enough to establish a "tough on crime" reputation; marrying rich--not once, but twice; and his complete aversion to affirmatively stand on one side of an issue (especially Iraq).   Like Wes Clark, he believes he deserves to be president on the strength of his resume, not the logic, truth, or popularity of his beliefs. The end goal for John Kerry is not to accomplish anything, to make the country safer, stronger, or more prosperous; the goal is simply to be president, to be an entry in the Britannica enyclopedia. Leaders like these are rarely desirable, but especially dangerous at a time when a president must,&nbsp; must  be able to choose the long-term welfare of the nation over his short-term poll numbers. Clinton was incapable of this, and Kerry is, believe it or not, worse.
