      If you're wondering about the title of this post, no its not one of my aun'ts nickname for me. Its my new  multi-purpose  word   Shmuck   Now, it isn;t a bad word, nor is it a good word, its kinda  multi-purpose  Oh come on. You guys have heard of it. You know, shmuck (sh-muck), shmuckology, the study of shmuck? If you're going like "Oh, this guy's nuts" then please click the nice little X button at the top right of your screen now. OOh, and before you press that button, Shmuck You!  Nice to see the numbers on my hit counter have increased, many shmucks to that. By the way, SPIDERMAN 2's comin up, how many people are watching in the cinema? I'm not, VCD all the way, my "taiko"'s selling practically beside my house! There's also another reason.. kinda not sure about the ratings  (flashback) .... ..... (processing) .... ..... (static) .... *hits own head (FLASH)  2003- 4 people nearly got arrested and thrown into jail today for attempted entry into an 18SG rated movie The fugitives were caught as they were just about to enter to watch the hot movie at the time, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS Now what really happened:  Fugitive: What the? Who are you? Why're you talking to me??? (oops) (shmucks the fake fugitive, who turned out to be an innocent passer-by) REAL Fugitive: Well it was like this, we wanted to watch Matrix, so we bought some other stupid UMUM show that was showing about 10-20 minutes before Matrix                And so we went past the guy, and entered the cinema. And then one of us who looked 18+ ish bought the matrix tickets and we swapped the tickets in the men's restroom                And upon exiting the loo, stupid us got over-excited and entered the cinema showing matrix, a good 10 minutes before they even started TAKING THE TICKETS                And so a guy entered and asked us "Where's your ticket?" We showed him the matrix tickets, and he smiled and motioned for us to follow him out.                Then the 'general manager' came, we suspect he wasn't because 20 minutes ago he was carrying drills and stuff, we think he was the resident handyman.. anyway                He dissapeared for like 10 seconds, and came back and said "Well, i watched the tape on the security cameras, and i didnt see you entering for matrix, now WHO TORE YOUR TICKETS?"                Our minds were like "Shmuck".. And we made up some stupid story about some 'unknown guy' tearing our tickets.. and the 'GM' laughed and he kept pestering us to tell the truth                Bad right? When it seems like it couldnt get worse, the damn matrix movie-goers came and the guy was berating us in front of them!!!! AH THE HUMILAITY (no such word)                At one point, we were going to crack, but one of us kept going, sticking to the story and digging our graves to like 452 feet. Then the 'GM' mentioned that if you had no ID to prove yourself                he could and would send us to the police. That was it. I gave him the fake tabs, the thing they tear out from your tickets and put into the box.. and he SMILED!! Shmuck him i say!!                And so we went to watch the other movie that we hadnt even heard of.. 'Uptown Girls' i think. If that wasn't enough, the shmucking projector was senget(BM slang) and the heads were coming out of                the bottom of the screen and the bodies were at the upper part!! TALK ABOUT BAD LUCK!! I've HAD EM' ALL! Shmuck Reporter: And who are those 4 fugitives?  Well, I'll tell you. Chen, Mahesh, Wenhan and me. The end. This is a true story. It is not fictional. It really happened you shmucking moron. Make sure it doesn't happen to you too.

      Another routine day at school, boring and sad.  I kinda lost the will to study already.. should get it back soon  Anyway, someone pointed out that this site isn't bad, only its short   Well whaddaya expect moron i made the site yesterday!!   Now i'm not gonna mention names or anything, you know who you are. I'm sitting at the very back of the class, and today my teacher threw an eraser like -------   And no, it DIDNT hit... dissapointed? Got Add. Maths tuition later, i wonder: whats the most hated subject in school? most people would say "History!!" but i said most HATED subject not most BORING subject. Let bygones be bygones i say.Who needs to remember all those? Well thats just me. If you gotta problem with that then go kick yourself or something. I cycle to school, now how many of you people actually take buses and cars and stuff to school?   Shame on you!  Polluting the environment with those poisonous gases, i wonder why you guys dont just set the whole EARTH on fire! That would save time!!! Not that I'm too poor to afford a car or anything. Actually i'm kinda well off. Yes, richer than you, moron. Planning to take driving lessons next year actually, if the FREAKING government doesnt raise the DAMN age limit to have driving lessons!! WHAT THE HELL's WRONG WITH THEM? Hey, Just because you old bags at the government can already drive DOESNT mean you can deprive the younger generation of one of the very FEW luxuries of life!!! Half of the accidents on the road are probably caused by you old coots, with your poor vision and frail bodies. THANKS A LOT YOU FREAKING GOVERNMENT! Not that I'm anti-government or anything, i just want it to be fair, i wanna drive too!! Speaking of Report Card Day, i got 22nd in the class! Thats my lowest postion in class EVER!! And I'm not a nerd. You are. My class is full of smart-asses who have no freaking lives and just study study study all day long. I mean how can people deprive their own lives of girls or games or movies or anything like that. These people are crazy.  Me? I play Ragnarok Online, Gunbound, and um... a bunch of other games. Used to play DotRO also (ehem ehem server) but its closed for a while now. Wish it could reopen soon. Anyway, about Gunbound, if any of you play gunbound, did you notice the extra time it took to reopen the servers? DAMN FREAKING LONG!! lucky its free or i would ask for my money back. Okay enough for now. I have another story, about my broadband provider.. OOOH they made me so mad!! But thats a story for next time. Keep visiting ok? It really lifts my morale.

      God its been a terrible week  Starting last saturday, on Ko-kurikulum Day  Had to do the Moral kerja amal.. so happen the school got flooded.. anyway did it later.. Boon Tat organized the whole thing, he promised me the photos and surat pengakuan, a SIGNED surat pengakuan on Monday. Sounds great.  Monday.. his brother apparently opened the camera.. so the film was exposed. Great. But accidents happen. Surat Pengakuan then. "Oh I'm waiting for my friend to pass HIS surat pengakuan to me so I can get the 'isi-isi penting'" What the hell.. I got angry la of course, you dont promise people something and then go back on your word.. I said like that you could have told me, I could just make a phone call!! Everything would have been 'kau tim'ed. But NO.. he had to do it HIS way. Of course, i got pissed.  Tuesday.. I brought my OWN camera to take photos.. couldn't afford to trust him again.. what if his brother opened the thing again? So we took the pictures after school.. surat pengakuan? so on this day only he passed a draft to ME! ask me to print out. What the hell?! You promised me a SIGNED surat pengakuan on Monday.. now NOT only did you not do it, you ask me to PRINT it? And remember he wanted the 'isi-isi penting'? Guess what is was. "Saya, Zakaria bin #$%^ mengaku bahawa ___ telah membuat kerja amal pada 24 Julai." Just like that. OF COURSE I GOT MAD!! That's the second time in 2 days he procrastinated. Somemore I havent done my PJK project.. and the crossword puzzles.. Think what i got a lot of time is it? And it didnt help that i have tuition EVERY DAY. So at night i was rushing.. simply copying Roger's PJK project, modifying Hyon-Xhi's moral project, and then the crosswords.  Kononnya do it in a group. When ask to fill in personal details, ok. When comes to answers and slogan , "You do la I lazy". When i asked the money how? "Share la". WHAT THE HELL!! I got so freaking stressed out and so mad.  Wednesday.. I brought the surat pengakuan to school.. and guess what.. NOW Boon Tat comes and tells me that not ALL the pictures were exposed.. meaning I took the pictures on Tuesday for nothing. I tell you! What stupid s$%t is this? I also couldnt finish the crosswords.. i took them to school and told them if they didnt do it, I wouldnt share the prize money with them. "Aiyo we bincang at night la" .. can you feel the frustration I'm feeling by now? Also, my mum lectured me on being a slave for other people. "People study and leave you to do the stupid work. When win that time must share with them. Dont so stupid la!!" Thinking about it now.. she's right. I'll learn to say NO from now on..  Thursday... Must hantar moral by Friday.. and GUESS WHAT? Remember the surat pengakuan i passed to Boon Tat on Wednesday? He lost it. He FREAKING lost it! I really lost my cool there.. At this stage.. so crucial.. and he messes up. I was really pissed off with him now. But that's not all. Remember the photos I said were for nothing because not all of Boon Tat's film was exposed? Well turns out they had SOME use after all. After looking at Boon Tat's camera's photos.. OMG.. looks like he hasn't held a camera before. All the shots were of my butt.. my side.. the back of my head.. and all HIS photos looked great.. because I took it. BUT HOW THE HELL ARE PROPLE GONNA RECOGNIZE ME? FROM MY BUTT SHAPE IS IT? I really got fed up. I REALLY GOT FED UP. The worst part? He asked me to PAY for it. Consumer rights? I donno I was really pissed off. And it gets worse. He wanted to give a copy of a SIGNED surat pengakuan to his friend, who was SUPPOSED to do the kerja amal with us but went off to the CYBERCAFE. I said "What for? He didnt do work and he shouldnt deserve the thing. If like that might as well I didnt do the kerja amal.. I could just ask you for a surat pengakuan!!" And he said "Put yourself in my shoes.. If your friend asked you what would you do?" WELL STEP INTO MY SHOES FOR ONCE!! MY WHOLE WEEK IS LIKE SH$T BECAUSE OF YOU!! AND YOU REWARD PEOPLE WHO DONT DESERVE IT?????!!!!!!!!  I really hated this week, I was just waiting for it to end..  And to make it worse, I didnt drive at all this week, i had DOUBLE TUITIONS ON A FREAKING SATURDAY, and BOON TAT IS AN @SS%()@#!.  The only good thing that happened this week was the PasaR Malam on Wednesday..

      Argh! Went to the dentist today.. ya la i drove there, with my mom beside me.  I think it's been what.. 1 year + since I last went to the dentist..  Recommended 6 months once   Anyway, aiyo go there got 'cun-chick' open door..  then went into the  SURGERY ROOM  I'm putting that in caps cause i'm scared of it..  AH!! Another 'cun-chick'!! Where can? How can you open your stupid filthy disgusting mouth in front of a cun chick and ask her out later?  To make it worse, the dentist told me i needed  3  fillings!!  I thought i saw the cun chick's face drop. Oh well, there goes my first handsome impression..  aiyo 3 fillings!! wa lao wei..  Why do dentists wear the face masks while working?  1)They dont want to drool into their patients mouths, especially if its a 'cun chick' 2)So that you dont see them laughing at the condition of our mouth,  3)So that you can't recognize him if something goes terribly wrong.  I HATE THE DENTIST!!! 1)He like drilled into my teeth and went,"Oh, theres a hole!" Well of COURSE theres a hole after you drill something!! 2)He made me look bad in front of the "cun chick". Thanks a lot!! 3)He was wearing a i-look-friendly-but-i-got-a-knife-with-me look  Why you should brush 1)You wont have to hear "Oh, terrible, terrible" or "Thats funny... What is it?" 2)You wont be TOTALLY HUMILIATED IN FRONT OF THE CUN CHICK!! 3)So your mum wont get angry.  Anyway, thats it.

      WAOAAOAAOAOAOAH!  got to drive the Mercedes today, my mom let me take it for a spin, of course with her in the passenger seat. She only let me drive a short while.. scared i would knock something or 'terbabas' into a drain or hit other cars like that.. I would say she got no balls, but then again its true... hmm..  oh man..   I've been eating KFC once a week for 4 weeks now!   OMG the happiness...  I finally taught Wei Wei to use the blog site, he'll be posting on the Geng Lepas Sekolah website from now on.. go and check it out! (links section)  You know what i think the best part of a chicken is? The gizzard. ( i dont know if i spelt it right) Its the rubbery thingy, 1 in each chicken i think,   Innards. Oh fried innards. I'm salivating at the thought of this. haha.. i'm late on my schoolwork again.. sigh never got around to revisions yet, i fall asleep everytime i try, something like Asiah's BM tuition.  Speaking about Geng Lepas Sekolah, Weng Yip decided to invite not 1, not 2 but 3 MORE people.. I mean, its supposed to be an EXCLUSIVE group.. So i wasnt very happy with it. Got a couple of people hate mailing me on the tag board over there, i have some idea as to who it is.. go check it out.  Anyway, perfect day today, hopefully good day tomorrow. Another good point: i only owe Chee Liang 1 Chee Cheong Fun now! previousy 3, just for changing places with him at assembly because he didnt want to stand too close to Christina. No not the form 4, the form 5!!! Yea I'm a little scared too, seems she has a habit of saying the L-word to certain people, and attractive people like me should ALWAYS take preventive measures in such circumstances.  Ok off to bed now, ending a good day.

       Its been ages since i last blogged, but i've been SO busy, and all my computer time devoted to Geng Lepas Sekolah. (check the links)  Anyway, about the Star Basketball Tournament, 4th place in my very first tournament! Good? donno la.  When it's MY fault we got 4th instead of 1st. Oh well, simple mistakes, we lost the final 2 matches by 1 point each game! How freaking close is that!  so 4th we are.  Went to Roger's birthday in the evening, my tuition finished at 7.30 Then my mum decided to go eat steamboat, and so by the time we finished it was 9.00pm what the heck.. then when we were going over to Roger's place, we STOPPED at EVERY FREAKING TRAFFIC LIGHT ON THE WAY!! How FRUSTRATING! So I finally reached there at 9.30. Had a great time though, except they were forcing me to eat food and stuff.. Then we decided to visit Boon Tat, living only a few hundred meters away.  And guess what? Turns out Roger FORGOT to invite Boon Tat, a person staying only a couple of meters away from HIS HOUSE!! How thick is that?  Anyway, besides Kean Leong expressing interest at every old lady who passed us, it was okay i guess. Ooh and have you EVER seen WENG YIP running? I was laughing and couldnt stand straight!! AHAHAHAAAA  Next day, i found out that our Mercedes is now an AUTO!! looks like i can drive it soon. Speaking of driving, my father let me drive all the way to the barber's today in the Sorento. How cool is that? How many of you get to drive your families around even BEFORE your 16th birthday? How cool is that? although not legally, but still..  Great day. Oh yeah i also went to the McD drive-thru.. freaking fast service, no sooner had we said our order when it was shoved right at us!! Fast man!! Shmucks!

      As you know, Webbit is the new broadband provider in town.   Webbit = Wireless Broadband  Streamyx people are so USELESS.  They wouldn't understand logic even if it slapped them in the face.  FLASHBACK: (7th May 2004) Me      :I would like to request a technician because I can't connect to Streamyx. Streamyx:Are ALL of your modem lights on? Me      :Just make the request. Streamyx:Okay, your report number is 12345. Please allow 2 working days to process.  (After 3 working days) Me      :Can you check this report? 12345. What's wrong? Streamyx:Oh I'm not sure la. Don't worry I'll forward this to my Upper Level.  (After 2 weeks) Me      :Can you check this report? 12345. What's wrong? Streamyx:Oh I'm not sure la. Don't worry I'll forward this to my Upper Level.  (After 3 weeks) Me      :Can you check this report? 12345. What's wrong? Streamyx:Hello? I'm Mr. Hairi. I'll make sure the technician comes by today.  (After 4 weeks) Me      :Can I speak to Mr.Hairi please? Streamyx:Hold on, Mr.Hairi is working the afternoon shift today.  (Afternoon) Me      :Can I speak to Mr.Hairi please? Streamyx:Hold on, Mr.Hairi is working the morning shift today. Me      :But I thought he was working in the afternoon? Streamyx:Donno, thats what it says.. Me      :Do you have a contact number? Streamyx:No. Me      :How the hell can you work in the same place but NOT have your colleague's contact number? Streamyx:I don't know sir.  (5 weeks) Me      :Can I speak to Mr.Hairi please? Streamyx:Mr.Hairi has stopped working here. Me      :What the hell...? Do you know I've been waiting 5 WEEKS? how would you like it if you went 5 WEEKS without salary? Streamyx:Well if I dont work properly I - Me      :Thats not the point! I'm trying to show you how long- Streamyx:If I didnt work properly I wouldnt expect my pay. Me      :THATS NOT THE POINT!!!  (Latest-somewhere 2 weeks ago) Me      :All of you are useless. Streamyx:Thats what you think sir. Me      :WHAT!! I KNOW YOU ARE USELESS!! LOOK AT YOUR STUPID SERVICES! NO TECHNICIAN FOR 2 MONTHS!! Streamyx:I tell you what I can do sir. I can forward this to my Upper Level.. Me      :I've been HEARING THAT FOR 2 MONTHS ALREADY! Streamyx:Thats the BEST I can do sir, the BEST. Me      :Thats WHY I SAID YOU WERE USELESS! Streamyx:Thats what you think sir.  What the Shmuck? Stupid huh? I wasted as much time as Roger would, talking to Swee Ling. As soon as Webbit is available in Klang, I'm SWITCHIN' The only reason I can connect to the Internet now is because I fixed the problem myself.

Found out a LOT of stuff..  1st)  The food that was provided shmucked  2nd) I know what i have to do to get what i want 3rd) Everyone thinks I'm the fat kid who likes to eat 4th)  The food that was provided shmucked   about the 3rd... that's gotta change man..   Colleges are actually pretty cool, and the buses are EXTREME We were literally flying from our seat as we hit one of the bumps on the way.. Driver way to go!  And about the class page in the SURIA magazine..  I personally feel that since its the  CLASS  page, it should be done by the  WHOLE  class, instead of  CERTAIN  people  You know who you are, I wont say names Imagine my shock when I found out that the way the class was gonna remember me was of me taking a nap during the chinese singing competition.   MY CHILDREN ARE GONNA SEE THAT AND GO "Dad, you were fat AND LAZY?" NOW WHATS YOUR PROBLEM DEGRADING ME LIKE THAT!!!   I feel so helpless my schooling memories are being recorded in a way that I detest, by people whom I now detest, and that i can't do a SINGLE thing about it!!  THANKS A LOT YOU BUNCH OF SHMUCKERS!! THAT MADE MY DAY!  I hate you  P.S. I'm serious. This isn't makin a big fuss, it's the truth. And i hate it. And I hate you.

Among the prize contenders are:  Roger and Swee Ling (DUET) Ei Ling (SOLO) Edwin Chen (SOLO) ? Adrian Tan (SOLO) Dll...  anyway, who do you think will win?

Now the performance that EVERYONE will be looking to on friday would be:  (drum roll)  ROGER AND SWEE LING !!!! The chances of them winning? well lets just say only Roger's self-esteem is lower than that. Hey, not that their BAD or anything... give them a shot and i hope they'll prove me wrong!

      " On this day.. the world shall fall, and witness the rebirth of a hero destined to rule the world"   Confucius's Brother   Yea! My birthday! 22nd August.. still 16 only though.. cant drive legally YET.. hahaa 'legally'   So whats new in the world?   Ponteng on Friday go CC play CS with Roger, Weng Yip, and Wei Wei.. lol!  Careful with wei wei.. if he admits he can play means he damn good at it.. if he say he play once or twice only means he quite good  Understand his language.. he wont admit ever playing the game if he isnt good at it.  So on Friday.. "Wei Wei, can play CS or not?" "Can" "OK I become your team"  no joke man.. MVP  Watched football last night.. Im a Norwich City fan now.. besides MU They dont play good.. but they're full of energy.. reminds me of.. um.. me!  Getting kinda bored of blogging.. the novelty's kinda wore off Sunita Update Her husband is a total prick.  This issue isnt settled yet.  Stay tuned..

      I have no respect nor love for Sunita AND her husband or whoever it is that is running the photostat shop in her centre.  I go for 2 tuitions on Saturday. Moral and Sejarah.  Moral is RM150 for 4 months Sejarah is RM 180 for 4 months  I remember paying for 1 subject in full somewhere around May.. I paid RM10 only for he other subject as deposit  Actually i thought if they didnt call me i could just get away with it(hehe).. But I was dead wrong.  So I go to tuition today and Sunita calls out my name to see her after class. No problem. I knew i only paid for 1 subject but i was taking 2.  So I go up to her office and say my name and her husband looks at the register and says "Edwin Ng? You havent paid for any subjects at all.. just RM10 for both subjects"   What the shmuck?   So I say "I already paid for 1 subject in full" Husband: No, it says here you havent paid. How much did you pay? Me:      Er... about RM145? Husband: Thats not the correct amount.. you must not have paid. Me:      ???? Sunita : Who did you pay to? Me:    : You Sunita : Me? Wait we'll counter-check again  So what the hell? I paid already and now they're asking me to pay AGAIN? I know i havent paid for 1 subject but 2???!!!!  I hate their freaking guts.. especially that shmuck of a lawyer. (Shmuck actually means goat's penis, someone pointed out to me.. but who cares? he fits the description all right)  I hate her:  1)For not taking me as a student during Form 4 (even though i had better results than some of her other sorry excuses for students) 2)For this incident.. CHEATING me of my money. Talk about daylight robbery.. they'll rob you blind 3)I donno, i just hate them for reasons 1 and 2  So there.. 3 reasons NOT to like them.. so i obviously HATE them. Shmucking fraudsters.   urlLink    I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them

      Just when you thought it was goin to end...  Monday...  I brought the crossword puzzles to school, hoping that at least we (or rather, I) could get it done quickly. But no. That @@## Roger didnt come, so no postcards for me to paste the puzzles. Oh well. Put it off to the next day then.  Tuesday...  Wei Wei didnt want to come to school because he was scared of donating his blood. ? .  Anyway I also got malas, so i skipped too. But I got dearly punished for playing truant. I got sick. I got a headache, sore throat, flu, you name it i probably had it. So the crosswords had to be left for tomorrow.  Wednesday...  Skipped Asiah. That was supposed to be good. Until I met one of the other guys in tuition outside. Crap .. wonder whats gonna happen to me next week.. Now the crosswords. We had 9 of them. And they passed it to me to pass to my mum so she could hantar the postcards. Slight problem. THEY WERE ALL BLANK!. ALL! MY STUPID "GROUP MEMBERS" DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO DO ANYTHING!! NOT THE SLOGAN, NOT THE ANSWERS, NOT EVEN THEIR FREAKING PERSONAL DETAILS! Somemore i didnt have the clues to the puzzle, and it was night already.. i had to pass it to my mom the next morning! AND I'm sick.  But thats not all. I called Weng Yip, I called Roger, I called Wei Wei, I called Wenhan.. my supposed group members.  Weng Yip? He promised to call me when he thought of a slogan. Never got back to me. Roger? ROGER? THAT @#%% REJECTED MY CALL!! MY OWN "GROUP MEMBERS" REJECTING MY CALL! KINDA MELAMPAU RIGHT? DAH LA TAK BUAT, BILA ORANG NAK TANYA DIA BUAT SLOGAN, DIA REJECT PULAK! AND YOU KNOW WHATS WORSE? HE FREAKING SWITCHED OFF HIS GOD DAMN PHONE!! TALK ABOUT HELPFULNESS!! HE IS A  $%@$@#!#!%@%#%#Q$@#@%#$~~!!!! Wei Wei? The stupid guy went out to play basketball. Dah la tak ajak, tak buat pun crossword. Wenhan was the only person that helped me. But the both of us couldnt do it alone.  Thursday.. I was supposed to pass the puzzles to my mom in the morning before i went to school. I didnt. HOW COULD I? HOW IS 1 PERSON GOING TO FINISH 9 PUZZLES? 9 BLANK PUZZLES? WITHOUT THE CLUES? I really got fed up with those useless #$%^^. I just brought it to school, slammed the postcards in front of them and said "Look, I am fed up, I wont send. I dont want to do already" Then only they started to panic a LITTLE.. but not Weng Yip though. I think he wouldnt mind even if he got the freaking money.. he didnt give a crap about anything going on. And he expects a fair share of the money. If like that might as well give Terry a fair share also right? After all, they BOTH only  submitted their papers.. they didnt do anything more. Useless people.  Friday.. I didnt go to school again. Boring la... I managed to send the postcards through my uncle.. I only got the postcards at 11+ pm last night from Roger. Speaking of Roger.. he was at the police station last night. Wonder why? Ask him la. And now I'm typing this... This is really stupid. Im sick, I got stressed out AGAIN, I have to take 4 different kinds of pills, this sucks...
