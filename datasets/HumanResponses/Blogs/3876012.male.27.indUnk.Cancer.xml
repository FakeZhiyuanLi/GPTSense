      I was asked by a few people to write a poem.&nbsp; So here goes, and I have to admit.&nbsp; I am not a poet in anyway shape or form.&nbsp; So please read lightly:  &nbsp;     I can taste the salt,      from the last tear I shed for you.

      Admiration.&nbsp; What a beautiful and calm word.&nbsp; I know that everyone either secretly or openly admires someone in their life.&nbsp; To me it's the unsung hero.&nbsp; The people that make sacrifices each and everyday for someone they love.&nbsp; The people that do not look for any kind of monetary payment.&nbsp; They do it all for a smile at the end of the day.&nbsp; These people put their hearts on their sleeves.&nbsp; These people come in all different sizes, colour, and ethnic backgrounds.&nbsp; There is no set rules or regulations on how they became&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;special heroes.&nbsp; They are so easily over looked like the ever calming songs of the birds in the morning.&nbsp; The wonderful smell after a spring rain fall.&nbsp; They may not be ambulance EMTs, nor Life guards.&nbsp; They may not wear special uniforms, or badges.&nbsp; They are in everyone's lives, maybe you work with one?&nbsp; They might be a brother, a sister, a mother, father, aunt or uncle.&nbsp; They could be a friend, or a relative.&nbsp; These people don't stand-out in a crowd.&nbsp; They are your single parents!  &nbsp;  These great people deserve the title of hero!&nbsp; I should know.&nbsp; I know a lot of them.&nbsp; My sister for one is a single mother of what I like to call my shining light.&nbsp; My nephew Nicholas was born in 1993.&nbsp; The number I wear on my jersey.&nbsp; He has been there for me.&nbsp; On many occasions that he never ever knew.&nbsp; Days where I felt my world was crashing down, he would just look at me and smile.&nbsp; I want to ask him one day how he does that.&nbsp; That little thing he does when he smiles.&nbsp; They way it lights up the world.&nbsp; He is my little buddy.&nbsp; The way he looks up to me. He has called me his hero.&nbsp; He even did a school project on me!&nbsp; I am always overjoyed when he comes to visit.&nbsp; He is my world and the most happiest moments with him are when he is happy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  His father wasn't around much when he ws growing.&nbsp; For reasons I am not 100% sure about.&nbsp; But he has had other male figures in and out of his life. The reasons they did not stay?&nbsp; I don't think any of them deserve to be with either my nephew or my sister.&nbsp; Not speculating that any of them would have been a great father, but something obviously didn't click.&nbsp; Of course, there are different reason on why some people are single parents.&nbsp; Some like my sister have yet to find the right one, others may have different circumstances revolving around the situation.  &nbsp;  Some have pushed their partners away, others the partners have left.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some partners are lost forever.&nbsp; Due to life ending occurrences.&nbsp; None the less.&nbsp; heroes they shall all be in my heart!&nbsp;

      As the old saying goes, "Your life is supposed to flash before your eyes.  Right before you die."  If you where to die today, how long will the flash back take?  A second...a minute.  Will you be happy after seeing all your hopes and dreams flash before your eyes at an excelerate speed?  Of course you probably will not be happy after the brief and quick viewing of your entire life, as it's about to end.  Regardless, I wish we could look at the past quickly with out the death experience.  This way we can all re-evalutate our lives.  Our past experiences, loves, hopes, dreams, and mistakes that have made us who we are today.  Look back and remember all the odd turns in life that we took.  Get a better understanding of ones self and the sacrifices that have taken us so far in life.  Maybe just to even see someone make a great sacrifice for us, which at the time we neither knew it nor appreciated it.  We need to hang on to these hopes and dreams.  The road of life is paved by good intentions.  Our hopes lead us to a greater future. Our dreams fuel our desire to make it in the world.  I highly doubt anyone dreams about working an McDonalds. Not that it's a bad job, but more a stepping stone on the way to bigger and brighter conquests!    I just hope that I never loss sight of myself like I was have.  Not again!  I don't regret it, but I also have learnt that you cannot please someone else if you are not truely happy.   Act on instinct, no regrets, only honour!

      I stand here looking out the my front window. Having a cigarette and cofee.  Watching the rain gently fall to the ground.  Having intense feelings of being utterly lost in time.  The cigarette burns slowly and the coffee appears to be internally thermal.  Almost pasued.  Time seems to be frozen, gets me think about life. Frozen between the past and future.  How do you move ahead, when your heart and mind are stuck between two places.  I can't seem to move ahead and I don't want to go back.  Could it be a mental block?  The reality of losing someone that meant a lot to me so quickly and for absolutely no logical reasoning.  My brain is not wired to handle this. Of ocurse I haev forgiven all past disrections.  How can I be worth anything to anyone if I witheld these emotions.  So I write this in the hopes that it is theraputic.  Plus, to present to myself that I am not a coward.  I will not hide behing the hurt.  I am attempting to move forward.  To unfreeze time.  I'm splashing my feelings adn thoughts on the web.  Standing here stupified and in utter augh of my own thoughts. A year ago I was to scared to reveal my emotions and thoughts.  Even to myself, nevermind at easy access to anyone with a mouse and the patience to read the ramblings of a person they hardly or don't even know. I know I am not perfect.  But, anyone that reads my postings are allowed to see me at my worst.  So now my life starts a new.  Numerous choices and options at my finger tips.  Now all I need to do is find the courage to face this new world.  Smile and whistle a tune as I walk through the darkness, looking for my light.

      A question we all have asked ourselves after the break up.  Why did we give it our all?  Why didn't we see this coming?  Why didn't I try harder?  Love harder?  Or just do more for her?  Well I have a question right back to all of us.  Why the hell do we care.  After giving so much, monetary and emotionally.  We where taken for granted.  Used and tossed away.  Like yesterdays news.  They have the clean break while we are left holding our poor jaded hearts in our hands.  Sulking like little babies and feeling like eternal darkness has clouded our eyes.  It's all the fear of the unknown.  Ultimately, I feel it's the fear of never meeting that special someone.  The one that gives you those butterflys in the pit of your stomach when ever you think of her.  The uncontrollable smile when you think of them.  They way you plan a vacation just to make them happy, take them anywhere just too see them smile!  You know that contagiuos, light the whole world, make your heart skip a beat smile.  Attraction like that is far and few between.  Main people take it for granted.  But, butterfly don't last forever and seem to die as we get older.  We need to charish these times and try to make the relationships work. I have learnt this the hard way.  Even trying to save a drowning relationship.  Putting myself into debt to buy clothes, hair cuts, trips, etc.  Making the burn of the break-up scar me eternally and emotionally.  Developing a intense trust issue.  This maybe be more my fault...or not.  I'm gonna be the bigger human and say it was me.  We all have our faults.  But, the naive, look to the sky and believe in fate ideology tells us all that there is that specail someone out there for everyone.  The hardest part is finding her.  Fate has dealt us all with bad hands...IT'S UP TO US TO PLAY THE RIGHT CARDS.  sucks don't it!

      Life seems to jump in leaps and bounds.  Unfortunately, when you fall you fall extremely hard!  Usually on your ass.  It seems that life has treated my incorrectly...or at least that is the way I see it.  It appears that I have the crap hand from the dealer and wil lprobably lose my shirt in one antie.  This game is not for kids or the faint of heart.  Maybe, only for us naive folk that still feel that if we try and hope real hard that we can still change the world. That love can save and heal all wounds.  That it's powers can push us through any obstical and chang ethe future of all man kind.  If only that where true.  My most recent experiences with the "Love Phenomenon" have provine otherwise.  This drug, which should be illegal, can control minds, shorten breath, and most definitely kill a man.  Though like all drugs it does have it ups.  The intoxicating feeling of soemone wanting and needing you.  The cloud touching affect of that first kiss.  The delsions that everything will be okay.

      When it comes down to realtionships the qoute from a smart unknown author "Nice guys finish last."  Just like when you meet a girl, and you feel like there is a connection.  She turns to you and says the most dreaded words a guy can hear, "I'm sorry.  You are a nice guy, but this just isn't working out."  OUCH...that's a slap in the face and a kick in the nuts at the same time.  Is this just the way they like to let us down easy?  Yet, I don't think that they understand that this line is not easy for men to take.  Kind of like dropping the soap in a prison shower.   So this bring me to my next point.  No matter how often we have heard the above statment and had our manhood handed to us but the opposite sex, we continue to where our white armour into ever confrontation.  Why do we play the good guys?  Is it the naive thoughts of grandure in assisting the damzille in distress?  It appears the more down a female is the more we want to help.  Maybe because we oursleves are so far down the spiral that we need something to make us feel better.  Since we can not help oursleves we try to help someone else.  Very noble statement...and so very moronic at the same time.

      I write this with a alcoholic drink poured down my throughout. By my own hand. I pour it to forget the past and the future seems brighter. Odd...The more drinks...The better my future becomes. Is it a delusion of faith? Or just a pre-conception of the actual future? Do I just have thoughts of grandeur or absence of faith? This is a question I will never know the answer to. I look into my bleak future and see nothing. I know that my personal future looks as good as I want it...The world is mine. But, for some reason my heart seems to fail to see the truth to my words. For I have all but given up hope. To find that special someone at this time seems absolutely in phathomable. Many of you have written me asking what made me this way? Once I was strong, confident and controlled. For now I am a former shell of my once whole self. My personal being is stronger then ever. My companion alas, is not to be seen. I have not found her...Or I haven't had the intestinal fortitude to speak my heart which I do on these pages. For you see I don't want to some off as a stalker nor a complete babbling idiot. Though I probably do tonight. Weird, the affects of alcohol. For some it turns them into abusive rejects, for others sentimental emotionality. I guess I'm lucky then...I feel that I have to express my feelings with words more then my fists. I guess my intoxicated rambling will get me no where and tomorrow I will look back and see what a foul I am. But, the only word regretted is a word not said. If we hold all emotion back, what emotion do we have to share? What point is there to living? I need to grab a whole of my emotions and control them. As the over flow like a rain barrel in a monsoon. This is not because of one lone woman. I have loved before and I know I will love again. The latter is thanks to one women that blew me away! She was kind, gentle, nuturing. Though I never told her so. I let her slip threw my fingers, like I always seem to do. She knows who she is. She made me feel special. She believed in me...What did I do. I proved her wrong. Yet, I have made leaps and bounds to a brighter future. Leaving the past behind. Only thing I seem to worry about is leaving too much of myself in the past. Not carrying the good parts into the future. I just hope I don't become jaded. All though I think that has already set in...

      I sit back and look into the world from the bottom of a bottle. What kind of life is this? I need to get back on track. I want to be more then this, I want to be able to live my life in a better way. A good friend asked me recently. "How do you keep such high hopes?" It didn't seem to be that big of a question at the time, but as I feel asleep that night it hit me. How did I? After dating a wonderful girl for 8 years and her breaking my heart, how did I not go into a downward spiral of despair? How did I keep my head above the water that has drowned so many poor souls? The pathetic answer is "I don't know." I guess I felt that there had to be someone else. Fate stepped in and has shown me a hard path. The path of self righteous and that I can survive on my own. Without emotional support from a girlfriend/wife role model. The best thing that could have happened to me. But, alas...These great feelings aren't lasting too long. I find myself on that rope again. Wondering if I'm going to find that special someone to ease this pain. Sure, after the girl that broke my heart, there have been others that have tugged at my heart strings and made the old heart do loops. But, no one to make me feel 100% whole again. With an exception. But that's another story for another day.
