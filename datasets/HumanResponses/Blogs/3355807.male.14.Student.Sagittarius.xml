      someday someone some where will find the end of the  universe and at the end of the universe will be some more humans  stuck in the PORATL TIME QUANTINIUM JUMBLER OF  DOOOOOOOOOOOOM. mean while back at studio 59 in the climorial totum  they were fast at search with their mongo sized  telescope of doooooooooooooooooooom. they figured the universe is  around 980,192,812,546,545,797,464,687,894,654, 651,351,435,486,798,651,651,miles long.which is  not to far to jog so my theory of expansion  depends on how many waffles can be flipped  in one minute by the master chef tony  elelegantepierre nytoy. so if u divide  that number by 980,192,812,546,545,797, 464,687,894,654,651,351,435,486,798,651, 654,688,674,321,465,764,then u will  clearly see that the universe is just  one big ballon getting blown up by  some kid named andy the UNKNOWN  WONDER OF  THE SEVEN SLABS OF CHRISTIANITY.  so tho there might be some tracks  of martains they can only be one  astronemer who  is the most UNJUSTIFIED person who  is Dayton undergrad Bentz. he who  will serve up the platter of dode is he who we  shalkl not spoke of and who we shall  not say who is Cody UNJUSTIFIED Steyer.  and the cobler of towns Nick the stun gun mCjager. now i am MCgeyver the man who made the statue of liberty replica out of an odd end of a plunger one pop can and some sap from a tree. but now you know we are all UNJUSTIFIED IN THE TIME CONTINUME OF OUTER SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.powederd toast man

      Sardines in a can can sit in the can, can get eaten, can stink, can have color, can get opened, can get swallowed, can get digested, can get pooped out, can form sandwhiches, can form salads, can get sold, can get dropped, can get fed to a cat.

      sardines in a can cant swim, cant move, cant do a sit up, cant open pop tarts, cant shoot hoops, cant climb a rock wall, cant love people, cant fly like an eagle out to the sea, cant listen to music in the 70's, cant go on msn, cant make a blog, cant talk, cant eat sardines, cant steal, cant mold a sculpture, cant type, cant walk, cant run, cant jog, cant buy things, cant drive cars, cant skateboard, cant do the olympics, cant breathe, cant transfer molecules, cant lose hair, cant lobb stubs, cant yell, cant kill, cant medal detect, cant watch real tv, cant drill a hole, cant play soccer, cant turn on a flashlight, cant hit the lights, cant box, cant drive you wild, cant put on axe body spray, cant take a shower, cant beat the hell out of each other, cant listen to heavy metal, cant form mosh pits.

      stumps have a power of there own. They can harness horses and climb totum piles. If u ever encounter a lonely stump on the road of sideton just tell him to stick it in his own kilm. But if that doesnt work just buy a pair of leggings a colar and a tie and a nice young lady you'll go courtin bye and bye. So maybe the trees just might not scrape against your window at night anymore so you wont get spooked.
