          After seeing some sexy blogs under WordPress I really wanna change. But I am too much of a loser to know how the hell to do it. I am working on installing it and having issues, so if anyone out there wants to give a sista a hand...HOLLA!

           I was even looking forward to meeting my sister's new online boyfriend last night, but I agreed to having them both over for dinner anyways.   When my sister arrived, all she did was talk about the guy as&nbsp; I made dinner. It was annoying, but I was happy that she was happy with him. She kept talking about how he said he wants to get married and have kids and travel. All the things that she wants to do.  As she blabbed on about him she hardly noticed that we had finished dinner and he still wasn't there. Then we watched four episodes of Sex and the City, he still wasn't there. Two hours later she called him to ask if he was still going to be able to make it.  "I'm in the car, on my way," he said as if she was being impatient.  Two more hours went by after that phone call during which we had time to go to the adult toy store, rent some DVDS and watch half of Along Came Polly with Ben Stiller. I had fell asleep during the movie only to be awakened by the sound of my sister getting ready to go home.   That fat bastard didn't show up. It really pissed me off because my sister is really a great girl. Actually, she is a woman, she is 31 for goodness's sake. Why are guys assholes? I really wanted to hunt this guy down last night and take a bat to his head...and I woke up this morning feeling the exact same way.  He didn't just stand her up, he stood me up too. How fucking rude!!?   Thank God, I learned my lesson about men when I was 17 and haven't had much trouble since then.

          I was out driving yesterday when I became extremely hungry. And I had an urge for a McDonald's ice cream cone. So I stopped at the nearest Golden Arches.  I had only been on the highway for a short while when I really started getting into my ice cream. And I started thinking of my man back in Beijing. Next thing I knew, I heard a loud beep. A white van had pulled up next to me during the stop and go rush hour traffic and had been enjoying watching&nbsp; me eat my ice cream as much as I was enjoying eating it.   I looked at the driver, only to see some fat nasty middle aged man stick out his tongue all aroused. I rolled my eyes at him in disgust...Can't a girl eat ice cream in peace? He flicked me off and got lost in the traffic ahead.  Moral: Don't let ice cream take you places you should only be with your man.

           Most Americans act as if them being born on American soil is some great accomplishment which gives them the right to look down upon immigrants whom became Americans through naturalization. But I see the definition of being American as a right of passage after a long struggle, journey, or trial.&nbsp;Those who fight for American citizenship and all that it stands for bring&nbsp;character, strength, and courage to the definition of being American. People who have&nbsp;enough&nbsp;faith to believe that their 'something better' will arrive after a while. People who left&nbsp;behind everything that was familiar to them in hopes of gaining something more.  When I think of my husband and our long wait until his arrival, I am grateful for our struggle. He has introduced to me what it means to fight for something that you really want, and how it feels to wake up in hopes for the arrival of your 'something better'. In so&nbsp;many ways, he has made me  more  American.&nbsp;

          My last blog went spastic and had to be killed. (Plus, a few people who I actually knew in real life were reading it) So welcome to my new blog, with more unadulturated stories.

           I know I am not ready to have kids yet. All I want is a puppy. My husband's mother keeps asking him if I am prego yet..I have a few issues with that. First is that, we haven't even seen each other since June, so if I am prego, it isn't his. Second,  I don't really want a baby until after law school. I have 4 years ahead of me that are bound to be extrememly stressful and I would hate to not be able to enjoy my child growing up.  There are other people in my husband's life that have asked a few times if and when am I getting prego. My conclusion is that the Chinese view of family is different from the American view of family in such many Americans who can have kids choose not to have them at all, or prolong it until mid-thirties. Of course, I do want kids one day, but not until I have enough money to be able to buy them all sorts of crap that they don't need.  My mother is another one who says I can have a baby while I am in law school. Geez! Who are these people fooling???  One thing is certain, I will have all my children in the US so we can all float in and out of China and other countries without having visa issues.  The truth of the matter is that everyone else is just anxious to see a black-Chinese baby. What color skin will it have? Will their eyes be like mine or his? Will their hair be curly, nappy, or straight? Honestly, I don't care, as long as my baby is healthy.

          It was about 8:40 on Monday night when Phyllis, my 65+-year-old landlord called me on the phone. I was startled because she usually doesn't call me at all, and we hardly talk, even though she lives on the first floor and I live on the second floor of the multi-family home. She called to tell me that she was able to make a photocopy of the lease, which I had requested in a letter attached to August's rent. "But I will not be able to give you a copy of your credit report. It's mine and I paid for it." She said quite plainly. "Phyllis, when I signed the lease you said you would give me a copy of it, plus it is more than just a credit report you have information about my family members and where they live, which is not at all relevent to you renting to me." I was shocked that she was being such a bitch about it and I usually am not confrontational but this was just plain wrong to me. "Well, I'm not giving it to you, and it upsets me that you don't trust me with such information," she said in a pissy-ass tone. At this point I was through arguing with her and so upset that I wanted to walk downstairs and strangle the whore. But I didn't. I just told her to destroy the parts that had my family member's information.  I'm moving out in the end of October because I refuse to put up with stupid shit like this from grouchy old women. I hate living in the same building as her because I feel like she is watching my every move (who comes to see me, and what time they leave).  Lesson learned: Don't rent from crotchety old broads that have mood-swings because they aren't getting any.

      I spent most of this weekend and yesterday, naked, cuddled up with one of my reserves. This time a 6'5" white guy with lots of tattoos. No emotional attachment on my part. But I like the closeness and affection that I get out of it. I had to turn off the ringer on the phones in my house so as not to spoil my fantasy world, and remind me that what I was doing was so wrong. After not speaking to hubby for two days, our relationship suffered, and I became apathetic. I enjoy living alone. And I am afaid of what changes will happen once he arrives.

           And I know it. I've been a sucky gf before so it is only logically that one day I turn out to be a sucky wife. But when your husband is not around, doesn't even live in the same country as you; it is soooooooo easy to be a sucky wife.

           I've recently been asking myself which is more enjoyable and I have concluded that the two are not mutually exclusive, at least to me.  Something as erotic as being grabbed or bitten during 3ex is just as enjoyable as a caress or a kiss.

      Today sucks for so many reasons. I have to leave DC today and go back to my crappy little city, I'm not looking forward to the flight at all. I stayed up late last night with one of my friends from around here, and I am so tired this morning. He says he wants to visit me next weekend. At first I said yes, out of sympathy, but I called him early this morning to shoot down that notion. That wouldn't be pretty.

      Hey all,   I writing to you from the wonderful world of Washington, DC. My job sent me here for some computer training. Its alright. My flight wasn't that long so I have no complaints; except for the shuttle driver on the way from the airport to the hotel which took three hours because the driver had the runs. (No lie, aka hershey squirts). But I made it.  I've been enjoying the DC scene, since I used to live here, and it makes me realize what a crappy city I live in now.  On the guy update: My husband is acting like a dumbass because I came here alone. He is really pissing me off in his insecurities. I told him that I am going out tonight, so I might not be around to answer his call. Then all of a sudden he starts acting 'funny'.  I mean honestly, if I am gonna screw around...acting 'funny' is not going to make matters any better for him.  Men. From the dumbass shuttle driver yesterday, to my husband acting really insecure...I am honestly starting to think they are the inferior sex.
