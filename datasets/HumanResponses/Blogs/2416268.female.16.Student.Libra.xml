      and the bells were ringing out for christmas day!! well not quite yet, but nearly!!!!!! i love christmas, who the hell dont? ok im sure their are a few people that dont, but in general, if u no what i mean!! i make no sense!!lol anyways thought i wud explain a little bit about the whole poo patch thing!! HAZ!! lol. im not gonna say what bothers me, only two people no, and i no they wont say anything. the thing is, im not gonna lie to you, i was having a fukin shit year, sometimes i would be a room full of friends, but still feel completly alone! i no sounds weird, but the first person i told understood!  then well i kind of didnt mean to tell the second person, not because i dont trust u haz, far from it, infact we were discussing something else, and i kind of sed it. opps. lol. love ya haz!!xx well what else can i say except that on friday i was still feeling a "odd", kind of as if i was floating above watching everything else happen, again weird i no, but thats the only way i can describe it. anyway, i am now how shall i say "re-joined" again, and back to 'myself', before this year. i really cant thank person numbr 1 enough, fuk nos where i wud be. even before through all the discussing we did, and time she spent trying to help (and that did help and mean a lot), it was friday that i really felt "normal", and it was because of her generosity (spelt wrong, but u get me yeh?) and a real symbol that i can hold on to through the tough times, something that helps me remember her words!! even though she definatly wont be reading this, i hope she knows that i will never forget what u did for me!! anyways i hope that kind of explains a little bit. lol. and if it dont well at least it made it possibly one of my longest posts.lol buy the way  cat g if ur reading this xxx im here for u sweetheart!! o and send me ur mobile number so i can text u on christmas!!  lots of love Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxx its christmas!!!!!!!! xxxxxxxxxxxxx

        You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        You are a human shadow.  If a loved one needs you, you are always right at his or her heels! Your deep social connection with human beings produces your qualities of genuine caring and charisma.  However, at times you are naive to the true nature of your loved ones.  Remember that humans' gift of free will does not always lead them in wise directions.  But your essence of love and friendship represent the other precious gifts of humanity. Overall you are a strikingly valuable and innocent being who has a lot to give.(please rate my quiz cuz it took me for freaking ever to create)    urlLink   What Kind of Shadow Are You?

"it only takes one tree to make a thousand matches it only takes one match to burn a thousand trees"  ok so today so far has been a pretty random day, to go with a pretty random person I suppose,   hmmmm............................   ok so I am having a few problems writing on here today, I just don't seem to be able to get the sentences flowing, not that they usually do, but its become really difficult tonight.  Haz - sweetheart I really hope you feel better soon, have a cup of tea, it is the quintecenctialy english cure for everything. Dont worry bout that problem, you will have to put up with the rest off us instead, sorry about that. oh and sorry for being an emotional bugger earlier, dunno what was up with me.  to the rest of you i dunno really what to write, i no dan is getting impatient so i will hurry it up, lol  ok im gonna give up now, this is proving almost impossible, i will write in a couple of days or so, when i can think of more to write  Love ye Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (the fairies not working again bloody things, they will be back though) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hello  bonjour ola gutan tag gooday mate (supposed to be austrailian) bonjourno aloha (Hawaiian) howdy partner (texan) ........um cant think of anymore......there are many more I no lol  right well now that the random start is over I shall do a random middle..  wie gehts? ca va? Como se dice "how are you" en espanaglo? how y'all feelin? (texan)  ........................................  whats that cookin on the barbie shilla? (australian) yeeehaa!! (texan) he olvidado mi cuaderno!! du hast durchfall Avez-vous une feuille de papier? don't mention the war!!  now that's a random middle, should I do a random end? I think so..  aloha Au revoir aufwiedersehn Goodbye sienara (Japanese I think)  ........................................  ok don't ask I have no idea  ok I will write a normal-ish one now  ok so today..........GERMAN.....that I believe explains itself ha  Ooh am soooooooooooooo tired today went running this morning and on ye old bike........went and got dressed and laid on my swing.....oopps thought I had only laid there 20mins. Had been two hours hahaha - well as they say.... time waits for no man - well it feels like it sometimes lol  ok so I have no idea what to write anymore, or even if I make any sense, my mind is turning to mush........ahhhhhhhh don't even think those nasty thoughts you lot lol hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  Ooh speaking of random here I go again...... how would you prefer to die by drowning or by burning? cremation or burial? (no I'm not planning murders.it was a conversation on the way home)  I think cremation.........heres my attempt at an explanation........ well first I thought defiantly not cremation because it seemed so final, like you were destroying any chance at an afterlife or your soul living on, but the more I thought about it, the more I think yes to cremation (and not just because I don't want to be eaten by the worms). I mean maybe it releases the soul from the body, no longer trapped but free, and then you have to consider the phoenix rising from the ashes - (here's a basic overview of the legend incase you don't know it - the phoenix is a supernatural creature living for 1000 years. Once that time is over, it builds its own funeral pyre, and throws itself into the flames, as it dies, it is reborn anew, and rises from the ashes to live another 1000 years. ) - don't ask how I no that - lol  feel free to comment and write your ideas on this subjuct, I would be interested to hear others thoughts and opinions  anyway i best be off love ye your Nat XxxxXXxxXxXxXXXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXXxXxxxxxxxXxXxXXxxX  ps i can't get the fairies to work today lol they will be back though mwhahahahaha

      hello where to start........  sod it lets start by saying wow look at the fume yesterday, wow didnt i get a little angry. well im not gonna apologize for it, infact i only wish they had the comment thing on their blogs and i would have posted it there instead. wow........can be kind scary i guess, i can imagine im not the nicest person to be on the wrong side of!!! Mwhahahahaahhaha.......o well thats me!!  got asked today why i  HATE  katie and especially danielle, well to be honest i dont really no, it mainly stems from the past when danielle got tia merit to beat cat l up at the fair, and lost alot of my blonde hair that night, but ahaha she got a punch in the face............ anyway some would say that i shouldnt bare a grudge, but its not just that, its everything she represents is more or less everything  i hate in todays world. the many people who wander round thinking they are something special, that they are gods gift, that we should respond to there every demand, that we should wipe there arses, that they deserve our respect because they can be mouthy, when infact the real special people that deserve everything they want are people like Haz, Kat, Char, Stefie, Cat, Vic, Sandie, Chris, Jordan, Joe, Adam, Dan.K, ........etc.....  ahhhhh today.....what a beautiful day INDEED lol ( a joke not many of you will understand) started off with the PE exam, that was very weird, all the questions seemed to be mainly common sense answer, which worries me because i always ALWAYS never write the correct thing, lol. anyway apart from that.......was nice, people came round mine and we spent the afternoon on the garden eaten ice cream - wow how much ice cream do i have in the house you will not believe lol - anyway some had to leave early boohooboohoo, but Haz and Kat stayed a while longer woohoowoohoo,  YOU ARE WELCOME ANYTIME  (just let me no first, i wouldnt want you stranded on my doorstep)woohoo i had such fun, was so nice, we had a giggle didnt we? well i hope you all enjoyed yourself?!?!?!?!?   "DONT LET THE WORLD BRING YOU DOWN  NOT EVERYONE HERE IS THAT FUCKED UP AND COLD"    (remember that in times when it feels like the complete opposite) (great lyrics from a great band who i must thank  Char  and  Stefie  for introducing me to - there lyrics are so powerful and meaningful)  right well i must be off yayayayayayay love ye Nat xXxXxXXxXxXxXxx       yay to the reappearance of the fairies

(now you either understand that, or you dont, im not gonna write what im slapping my wrists for, coz i dont wanna)  right well i am gonna go and drag my sister to see troy i think, i hope we make it in time, and if we dont then maybe we will end up down a coutry lane again in some fields (sounds familier........ahhhh yes thats because thats what happpened to  day, ended up in the middle of nowhere on a lil old country track with nothing in sight except the odd fat cow-o well took some other off road and came put up at near blackheath and the hammerpot garage-only took bout 45mins to see life again lol)  right well i will see or speak to y'all soon (ish- gotta get some more credit)  love ye Nat XxXxXxxXxXxXxxXx

      What is it about my family? Why does everyone feel the need to ruin my sister’s happiness? Why do certain people not have the courage to say shit to my sister’s face? What is it about Steph that attracts such hatred? What has she done to deserve it? Why does it happen in every relationship she has? Why do people feel the need to break people’s hearts? What is the mentality of these people? Why have these people been given the gift of life, when so many wonderful people have to die? Why God why?  Hmmm yes so anyways, now that is out of my system…………  Ooh yes my Marilyn Monroe Autobiography came today!!! Yay…cannot wait to read it!!  Am going to Brighton tomorrow, may have to be restrained in the vintage shop, imagine the possibilities!!  Thank You Haz, for my pretty picture!! Thank You Stef, for my beautiful drawing!! Thank You Kat, for my fantastico fairy!! Ooh and I bet you thought I had forgotten, Thank You Char for my lovely pictures (remember the fairies lol)   -	What have I done to deserve all these wonderful drawings that    people have done for me?  -	What have I done to deserve you wonderful people?  Love Nat  xXx

       Numerology - personal number: 2   A natural communicator, you are diplomatic, sensitive and thoughtful. To achieve your full potential, you need to be less selfless.   Love:  You're sensitive and supportive but often don't get what you give. You could afford to be a little more demanding to ensure your own fulfilment.    Family:  Your natural diplomacy often means you mediate in family arguments but, as in love, you sometimes need to put your own needs first and let others sort their own problems out.    Fashion:  Your wardrobe tends to be understated and you prefer neutral styles in beige, blues and trusty old black and white. Be bold and invest in some stronger colours Â you'd be surprised at the confidence you'll gain.    Finances:  Well done, you're truly the mistress of your budget! You're very cunning at making ends meet, planning ahead and saving for rainy days. You deserve the odd treat though, so don't be afraid to splash out.    Career:  You are an excellent communicator and a natural teacher. Even if these skills don't lead you into teaching itself, a career that allows you to develop others' potential would be most satisfying.    Life goals:  Your altruistic nature often means that you gain most satisfaction through contributing to the happiness of those dearest to you. Invest as much effort in meeting your personal goals and you can't fail.   Now it's my turn.......................   I some me up in one word for all of these parts.... SHITE    My Writing Mood   I suppose its something must of us experience, and I think it has something to do with the fact that we were writing something everyday for 11 years, and now all of a sudden, we no longer have to!!  I need to write........I want to write, and that is not something I ever imagined me saying!! I do not have the ability to write, and yet I feel as though I should try! If I practice enough, maybe I can come close to making some sense!!  I actually quite enjoy writing, as long as its on a subject that intrigues me, I think most people can! What is the point of writing about a subject that bores you, as you will only bore the reader (as you are all bored now)  hmmm maybe that is why I never really write about me on here, as I find that subject really boring, I much prefer to write rambles, as I like to think about things! I cant help its part of my nature, being weird that is!!  Anyways......of the subject of my weirdness, as we all know that it is there!!  I am going to go, and no I dont think I will post again today..lol.... So I am now leaving, my writing mood still intact, and I hav nothing to write about......oh how I wish I had some brains!!

       Well today is another day in the many days that make up a life!   oh how I really wish I could be creative, but I know that I can't and so came to terms with that a long time ago!!   If I can't enjoy the ability to create I will enjoy the ability to admire and admire I love to do so fuck you God I am special too!  (no offence God, please don't send your rath upon me - lol)  anyway I must be off, just heard the kettle boil, now to watch Practical Magic with a lovely cuppa, hmmmmm a great day me thinks  See You Soon XxXxXxX

THANK YOU ALL FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, what i have done to deserve you lot is beyond me?!?!?!?!?!?!  love you  Nat

      I have been on quizilla and took the which movie star will you marry:   You are going to marry  Brad Pitt . He is always friendly to anybody he ever meets and he is very talented as an actor. He is also very sincere and friendly. He will respect you until the day he dies. Congrats!!   Yummmmm that would be lovely thank you very much!!!!!    What type of eyes:  Your: Happy eyes! Your cheerfull, bright and always want to try something new. Your inquisitive and quite lovable. You have many friends and will succeed in life   What is you soul's trait:  Your soul is STEADFAST. You are a fiercely loyal person who would never cross a loved one. People always know they can rely on you and your dependability is well-known. You're probably a little on the quiet side, but your faithfulness is never doubted, and you always back up your kith and kin whether they want or need it or not. You are a dependable and trusted soul.    What kind of Shoe are you:  Slippers- happy, sweet, and adorable, you are well loved by everyone. People cannot help but like you. You love to be surrounded by people that love you, who- in your case- is anyone.   What mythological creature are you?:   Griffin: Griffins are gorgeous creatures with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion. You are smart and can think on your feet. You also can be a bit of an airhead and may be called a ditz by others. You are not dtupid, but in fact, very intelligent. You are also eager to help others and are usually docile and submissive. But if someone offends you you do bite back.   Yes so anyways I am off to get ready.................... see you soon Lots of love as usual Lovens Natens

       Wouldn't it be weird if walls could talk?   Imagine the stories they could tell about all the overheard conversations, the tears, the tantrums and the laughter!!  The walls of my house could tell some weird stories that’s for sure, mainly to do laughter it has to be said, but there would be one very interesting story that is not amusing at all, and that is now five years ago and if the walls have a memory as bad as mine, then they will have forgotten the pain that was felt by all in the Keers household! 99.9% of what the walls have heard is though madness and laughter, tears of joy rather than tears of sorrow, and long may that continue!!  Our house is a very mad house indeed!!!!!!!!!!!   These are the days that I've been missing Give me the taste give me the joy of summer wine These are the days that bring new meaning I feel the stillness of the sun and I feel fine Sometimes when the nights are closing early I remember you and I start to smile Even though now you don't want to know me I get on by, and I go the extra mile These are the times of love and meaning Ice of the heart has melted away and found the light These are the days of endless dreaming Troubles of life are floating away like a bird in flight These are the days that I've been missing Give me the taste give me the joy of summer wine These are the days that bring new meaning I feel the stillness of the sun and I feel fine   See you later my little munchkins Love ye Nat

      Ok before I go off on another tangent, I must say a huge thank you to Kat!! I can't believe did that picture for me, THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! It be a fairy that will take pride of place on my wall!! The fairies are taking over my world, and I love it!!   THE LAST EVER DAY OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION   Woohoo its such a great feeling to be able to say that at last! Though to behonest the "leavers assembly" was a trifle shit, and I think we could have put on a better presentation. It was a real let down, but afterwards was cool. A group of us went and sat in Sam's (Miss Rawlings) room and chatted! See that we now be my memory of the last ever day, not the utter shambles that was put on before!!   And so the dawn of a new era arises   I am so please to be able to say that my perspective on life has not changed, but it is a new beginning! It is the beginning of a new chapter! That is not say that I am leaving the people in my old chapter behind, if anything I want them to be involved in all the chapters of my life!!  Mwhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha I have a little something for everyone going to the meal!!!!!!!!!! I hope you like it, it is not much, see I have no artistic or creative ability and so it is a bit pants actually.........hmmmmmmmm....................What was I thinking (oh and Char even though you canni make it to the meal.....I shall give you your one at a later date)  Oh yes that also reminds me.............................. .....................Oh buggery I do believe I have forgotten already..................................!!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!  ahhhhhhhhhhhh yes that be not it, but another thing,  MY MUM GOT ME A MARILYN MONROE T-SHIRT AND VERY NEARLY AND AUDREY HEPBURN ONE!!    now what the hell was that other thing I e=was going to write about....Why cant I remember.....Oh dear oh dear oh dear Keers's memory is getting worse, if that is at all possible?!?!?!!?!?!!  I really should watch men in black films anymore, they make me think about the universe things! You no like at the end of the first in when then aliens are playing marbles with our galaxy as one marble, and millions of others as other marbles! Then there is the second movie where our universe is one locker in a wall of lockers!! Hmmm I wonder if will ever be able to explore whether that is true, it would be quite weird though. I can just imagine the news reader going:-  This is the 6 o'clock news with me - Darren Jordan today's top story is, we have found the door to the locker!  A team of undercover SAS soldiers are now absailing down to investigate the other locker doors and see if any other universes can be found! It is a highly critical time and we hope to have an update for you in the 10 o'clock programme!!  Anyways I am  REALLY  looking forward to the meal tomorrow!!!  See you then, that is if  I don't see you before, after all my MSN eye is watching you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Much Love Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXxx

      Wooooooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Just had to get the fact that I am at last free, no more exams to hold me.......(I have been rhyming a lot today, for some strange reason, so please forgive me, it is not intentional)  Yes so I am free, but I find that quite strange to say as I have always been free, but what I actually mean I suppose is that I no longer have to think, do I have to do this piece of homework...........blah blah blah......It is really rather strange to be able to what I want when I want!! I have to say it's quite funky and I love doing nothing more than going for a run, and coming home to relax on my swing! Or of course going shopping, or to the beach, all the things that I love to do, when I want to do them, what could be better?!!  Ooh the meal.............................................It has arrived (nearly) and I have to say I am quite looking forward to it, it will be a nice to round off! Hmmmmmm you may say no, but I was thinking to myself again the other day that I would quite like to make a toast (don't no if you spell it like that, but that is how it is staying because it says what it is meant to mean) Nothing to formal etc....But I do have some things that I would like to say to people!! (Don't panic, its not I WANNA KILL YOU, unless of course I see people I HATE - *coughs*Katie, Danielle, Becky and co.) hmmmmm who is actually coming ...........Me......hmmmmm.....*thinks*... I wonder if it is some strange plot to leave me at the place on my own........ hmmmm lol  Anyways......*thinks*........      lol   Nah was going to say something else but my memory is becoming worse, I need to invest in some more post-it notes!! Ummmmmm........*what was it*......Ahhh yes that was it again I was thinking I should start doing something that calms the mind, like yoga or similar. I have been told before that it calms the mind and soothes the soul, and lets face facts I need something to calm my mind don't I!! hmmmm......*ponders*...........I shall invest in some sort of video I think......I think I think way to much sometimes.........  I shall leave you in a state of confusion that you have no doubt(lol the No Doubt thing was unintentional I can assure you) become accustomed to after reading what tripe I write!!  Much Love as always Noony (ahh bugger, I mean Nat, I have just seen Steph so that explains he Noony thing, as that is what she shouted at me from the car)

      When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.  When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.  When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.  When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.  When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.  When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.  When you're feeling tired, dare to keep going.  When times are tough, dare to be tougher.  When love hurts you, dare to love again.  When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.  When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.  When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.  When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.  When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.  When the day has ended, dare to feel as you've done your best.  Dare to be the best you can At all times, Dare to be!   Steve Maraboli     What can I possibly say after that?? Wow, I would love to be able to write like that, instead I write shite, shite that only confuses people, but that makes perfect sense to me, and that I suppose is all important, therefore if it makes sense to me, then to me it is ok!!   Hmm the country has gone Rooney mad, but that is ok with me, because it means that Beckham is all mine, yummmmmmm, all I need now is someone to take the shine of Brad and I will be having my cake and eating it!!            hmmmmmmm I can dream can't I??!!!!!  I think I shall leave it at those images today, hmmmmmm ok maybe a couple more......................             and of course I must finish of with ........................

      The trials and tribulations of life in the Keers household strike again, no not as serious as the last ‘event’ so to speak, but lets say this tomorrow could be a rather interesting day. If World War Three breaks out, like I much expect it to, then I will be out of here. They will not se me for dust, I shall just go, I will probably jump on a train to Worthing or Brighton and go shopping!! I’m not staying in too get stuck in the middle!  It is a long story, but I shall explain it as simply as possible……………. I was at work when I got a message saying that she was ok the car was a mess, but Steph had been involved in an accident.  That’s where all the trouble begins….not the accident but the attitude of my dad who rang from the states, to quote my mum “your attitude fucking stinks*  My sister is the first to admit when an accident is her fault, and yes sometimes she drives like a rally driver, but you cant in Hove, there is just some much traffic. Anyways my sister was edging out of a junction slowly into a gap that someone had left for her, so it was not her fault, she has witnesses saying that the post office van was going far to fast. But my dad, who I love, just goes off on one, saying that she needs more lessons, that she should not be on the road, that she is a fucking idiot….blah blah blah…… I have to hand it to my mum she handled it well, but my dad just goes nutts. Saying how it has fucked up his new that he is coming home two days early. How the fuck can it fuck that up, the only way it could would be if she was dead, which he didn’t bother to find out….it just makes me angry….. So if WW3 breaks out, I am not staying around to witness it!!  Anyways…………………..that’s is not going to affect my happiness….nothing ever does I don’t think……la de da de da………………..  Ooh I don’t actually no anymore, I am slowly losing the plot even more I think, that’s really quite worrying, can I possibly lose much more of the plot? Hmmm I expect so……  Ah yes………ah no….ah yes…..I’m still here believe it or not… still confusing everyone, still being weird, still being Natalie. I am always Natalie.  Much love as always xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey ho it is I the one that makes no sense anymore, I’m not entirely sure I ever did....................  Ok so what day is it today…………ah yes it is a very beautiful Saturday, the sun is shining, the birds are singing and I’m sitting here looking out of the window watching out for burglars. I don’t suppose that makes any sense does it, well I will try to explain in a manner that you can somewhat comprehend. This morning as my mum was leaving for work she caught a couple of people ‘casing the joint’ – they were basically saying stuff like “I think that’s the front door over there – number 9” – that was while the man was looking over the top of the fence to get a better look. They didn’t see my mum however, so I’m sitting here on my todd waiting for them to re-appear, and if they have the balls to do so, then God help them when the try and get in, they will have to kill me first, so if I’m not in for the test on Monday you no why. Lol, nah I’m sure there was nothing in it, but you know what parents are like, worry worry –“make sure you lock up properly, don’t answer the door to anyone you don’t know” as if I would leave the door open and invite them in for a cuppa tea. I mean I know I am blonde, but I’m not that blonde……. am I?  Ahhh yes it is Saturday, today is the day I am getting my haircut, woohoo, I can’t wait, just hope it looks okaledokalee…………..Ooh then tonight is Vic’s sleep over, yay, that reminds me must go out and get some wrapping paper!! I just know it is going to be a funkadellic night!!  Ok shall right some more at a later date  Love ye all Love your Nat xXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxXx

      Well I have to say I kind of agree with you there, I mean not necessarily the fact that this is another planets hell, (although sometimes I kind of think we do live in hell),  but yeah maybe that is true, maybe we are another planets waste bin, or where they dump the all the miscreants of there world, it would certainly explain some off the shit people that I have had the unfortunate luck in meeting! I was also thinking that to ants we are giants, but if they cant see us that means that they dont know that we are here, so maybe we are ants to something else. Maybe they look down on us like we look down on ants. Maybe they see us scurring about on our day to day business and tease us like we tease ants, maybe thats what is happening when it rains - they are pouring water on us to get rid of us, because they see us a pests, they are trying to drown us, like we try and destroy the ants nest! Maybe just maybe???!!!!!!  Yes so anyway...........................im going now....  Much Love to you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Suffering from mental disease, insane  2. Wildly foolish  3. Very enthusiastic  4. Excited   5. Crazy  …..etc……..”  hmmmmmmmm does that sound like me? Yes actually I think it does……..hmmmm kind of worrying, what am I saying I have always known that, its not exactly news is it!!  Anyways……..ah yes carrying on with this theme me weird……  “1. Strange 2. Bizarre “  …………….again I think that is pretty accurate.   That dictionary was talking to me………it was right in my eye line, I couldn’t resist, god that’s really rather pathetic isn’t it! Never mind……. la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da la de la de da  Ooh yes I almost forgot to say, how silly, I am getting my hair cut, yeh that’s right im gonna shave it all off……Nah not really im gonna have it cut a bit like Jennifer Anniston…….  Hmmmm……yes so what I am I planning, nah nothing, I have no plans, I only have my thoughts for company, and they don’t really make much sense, I mean take today as an example, sitting there with 30 minutes before they would let us go, and the thoughts in my head consisted of I wonder if anyone in here will end up in prison? Bizarre I know, but that was what I was thinking….. and I reckon a few will!!   ah yes.......hmmmmmm........*thinks*.....*thinks again*....*gives up*.....

      What a beautiful day it is again today, the only thing that could ruin it would have been the science exam, what to say about that..........not a great deal..........except i agree with you Stefie - who the hell is Gay Lassack? lol!  Anyways........*thinks*..........  ah yes that would be be it wouldnt it Nat........more of the confusion to come me thinks..................  Hmmmm Ooh yes I really think that, maybe, just maybe mind you I have started to scare a few people with my nonsense rambling posts (yes you Joe)……mwahahahahahahahaha, oh and speaking of Joe……..Emily Witt is now working at the body shop,   hmmm I think that the Body Shop has implanted something into peoples memories to make them work there…I mean it seems to be attracting everyone….hmmmm something is defiantly happening there…maybe they are transmitting some sort of  brain washing media…..hmmmmm I think that I think way to much….and not about the important things….like my exams, lol  woohoo………………………………………………….it is nearly the time when there are no more exams to think about, only how to spend as much money as possible on shopping trips, or how long can I possibly lay here without moving? Or what beach shall I visit today?…………hmmmm the summer……*sighs*………. Ooh and of course visiting everyone………I will see all of you whether you like it or not.

      ahhhh tis I The Fairy Queen aka The Shoe Ladyee aka The Slightly Insane Person Who Writes A Lot Of Shite!  anyways.......*thinks*....*thinks again*......*gives up thinking and just writes*.......  "I woke up this morning, The sunshine was shining I put on my happy face I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful To put on my happy face"  okaledokalee so I realize that the sun wasn't shining when I woke up, but you know what I mean don't you?  Ok so this has recently been described by one person as legendary (yes you know who you are), but I think that is going a little far, I would however say that it is confusing and random! Probably nothing more and nothing less……ok maybe less, lol,   la de la de da woop de woop de do la de la de da and a woop de woop de do  ‘can ya tell what it is yet?’  hmmmm how to cheer up a step by step guide:  1.    Realize that its probably not as bad as you think  2.    You are young and whatever it is, is a drop in the ocean of your life  3.    That you are alive  4.    Talk to someone (I’m always here for any of you, I am always happy to listen, I’m always happy to try and help)  5.    Lastly if none of that works come and see me, the Queen of being Happy and if you don’t feel slightly cheery after spending time in the company of someone that never lets a frown cross her face, then I dunno what to say, and I doubt this shite guide will help you!!  Ah yes in case you haven’t yet been able to establish the meaning of my blog, let me help you, it has no meaning, lol, it is here purely for me to write random stuffs about random subjects, on a very random computer, that has a very odd owner, that has a very strange house, that is in a very little street, that is in a very dodgy town, that is in a very squished country, that is in a very large world, that’s in an infinite galaxy, that’s in a extremely un-explored universe, that is probably 1 marble in a bag of marbles, that is one bag in a store full of bags, that is 1 store in a retail park, that is one retail park in an land full of retail parks, that is 1 land in a world, that is one world in galaxy, that is one galaxy in a universe, that is one universe that is probably 1 marble in a bag full of marbles……………and so the idea continues!!    And breathe  La de la de da Woop de woop de do La de la de da And a woop de woop de do   Personilty Disorders       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Low       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Low       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Low       urlLink Narcissistic :    Low       urlLink Avoidant :    Low       urlLink Dependent :    Low       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --       Ooh yes, i have decided to add a title to my posts, they will always be quotes, lol  Ah what a beautiful day it is today, its days like today that we should all be thankful for those who have payed the ultimate sacrifice and died so that we can enjoy freedom and prosperety!! Today is day that if you have feeling low, you should look outside and see the beauty in the world. You will realize and be thankful for the life you lead, yes so everyone has their ups and down, (even me-but not very often-once in a blue moon), but the trick is to realize that you are more fortunate than many!! Ok so having low self confidence is a different story, and i have no idea how to fix it, believe me i know all about that, i have probably the lowest confidence ever recorded,lol, but i still wake up in the mornings with a smile on my face, and go through the day enjoying every second of it! i wont let having no confidence ruin my life, and neither should anyone else who has this problem!! I love each minute of my life, and i cant wait to keep living, i enjoy the challenges that life throws at us,  I LOVE LIFE AND SO SHOULD YOU!!!  Life is a beautiful thing, experience, enjoy, and dont regret!!!!   Live life and enjoy it to the full Don't let anything or anyone hold you back Have dreams and aspirations, try achieve all that you desire!!  "Live life to the full, there is plenty of time to be dead"  What else to say.....nothing i don't think, hmmmmm what else what else could there possilbly be, sod it i don't know, my brain (lol) has been exhausted by todays lol!!!!  Much Love  Love Your Nat  Who after reading this you will probably no longer want to be your Nat, but the nutter you pass in the street, a nutter you don’t know, and never have known, lol  XxxXxXxXxxXxXxXxXXxXxXxXxXxXxxXxXxXxx

       &quot;My illusions didn't have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But, my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!&quot;    &quot;Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don't expect me to be serious about my work.&quot;    &quot;I don't understand why people aren't a little more generous with each other.&quot;    &quot;Everybody is always tugging at you. They'd all like a sort of chunk out of you. I don't think they realize it, but it's like 'grrr do this, grr do that...' But you do want to stay intact--intact and on two feet&quot;  &nbsp;    All by the very wonderful Marilyn Monroe  (to whom i am wishing a belated Happy Birthday, as she would have been 78 on the same day as my sister, the 1st of june)  &nbsp;

      Right well before I start........*realizes something*.......Ok so you could say that I have started, but I mean before I write properly.....*realizes something again*.........Ok so I never write properly, but before I write.....*gives up and hopes you get what I mean*....  I must make a  HUGE  apology to Stefie as I sent her an evil messages that was in fact meant for my sister, Steph, oops.......*fucking idiot*.......I new it was gonna happen one day, so I have now solved the problem and renamed Stefie Squif in my phonebook!   IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SORRY, IM A BLOODY IDIOT  xxXxXXXxXXxXxXXxXXxXxXXxXxXXxXxXxXxxXxXxxXxXXxXxXxXxXXxXxXXxXxX   Ooh and i'm running as fast as I can but there closing in on me, lol, ahh what am I to do? Dye my hair maybe......ah nooooo, that would obviously ruin my plot to blind society...God I must be soooo transparent, the plan has been figured out, must invent a new one!!..........hmmmmmm.....  ok so now it begins...........*realizes you are all thinking fucking knobcake that should stop writing confusing shit*.......but I will carry on regardless........  well what a week it has been, and the week has not even finished, so that should probably mean I should say what a half week, but it doesn't flow as well so it is staying as 'what a week it has been'.  ............*thinking*......................  hmmmm Monday........ah yes did my photo wall, now i have pictures of y'all on my wall. There is no escape...Mwahahahahhahaa..... ah yes well on Tuesday me and my sister went on a little shopping spree to Southampton.......(if you ever get the chance to go there then go, is absolutely brilliant) anyways where was I...oh yes... I GOT ME A MARILYN MONROE BAG ......well went halves with my sister....Its just got her face on it, I still want one with the most famous pose ever on it...You know the one where she is standing on the street in New York and her dress got blown up by the grill thingy......They did have that one but they had squished her face....grrrrr......yes so will still be looking for another one if anyone see one........Ooh yes Char has already said the Lanes ....Will go there and investigate at some point in the not to distant future.....Got loads of new clothes, lol, and a pair of shoes my total is now 5/6 I think.......Ooh got three belts, lol, well one was half price from the Gap...making it about £12..yay....one from River Island, and the other in Next. Southampton is wicked, the Topshop there is the best...its got all the best bits...there is nothing you look at and go WHY?....  hmmmmmmmm what else................Ooh how could I not mention the fact that I had Haz and Vic over to sleep on Wednesday......I loved the randomness of our chats, that's no suprize is it, seeing as this is always random......*hmmmm thinks there maybe a recurring theme*.........  "The Day After Tomorrow"  one word............ AMAZING ...The best film I have seen in a while, really gets you thinking...'What would you do the day after tomorrow?'...I mean this could really happpen, ok so not necessarily in our life time, but you don't know, I mean no one actually considers it being a very real threat do they until something happens to make us sit up and take note! Why does something always have to happen before we take any action against it? That goes for everything, look at 9/11 for example, everyone new about terrorism, and there are many suggesting that The White House knew that the attacks were going to happen, ok maybe not the specifics but there would be an attack on American soil, but they did not take note of the warnings and look what happened......Ok so they might not have been able to stop them, but then gain maybe they could have stopped it becoming such a life/world changing disaster. The same applies here does it not...Everyone knows that we are damaging the environment and causing our own downfall, and yet still very little is being done to change the situation!!!  hmmmmm got to got to work soon, am to tired to go to work......*fights to keep eyes open*............  bye 'd' bye love ye all love your Nat xXxxxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXXxXxXxXxxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxxXxXxXx

       Haunted    &nbsp; In the none traditional sense I am being haunted, and not by a ghost, no, it is something much more sinister and all consuming. My every effort goes into defeating it, and getting it out of my life, but I wake up every morning and there it is, haunting me, getting bigger and darker everyday. I just would like all my effort and time to actually make a difference.  Although I am incredibably&nbsp;happy, I would still love to get rid of it, to defeat it, to wake up one morning knowing that my work had payed off, and that I was thin. I  WILL  defeat it, even if it takes every once of my being, it&nbsp; WILL  be gone!!   Hmm doesn't take a genius to guess what is haunting me....just take one look....ahhh yes there it it!!  x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x  Hmmm I think I might go shopping tomorrow....I shall see what time I wake up because I have to work in the evening...Oh the joy!!  x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.....ha......  .......................  What else can I possibly say, I hope I am not coming across unhappy at the moment, I undersatnd that it might read like that, but I really am HAPPY, I HAPPY OLD NATALIE!! See look......can you see me smiling......laughing at myself as I just bashed my ankle...ooohhhh that fucking bed........  Ok so I am of now to take my revenge upon the inanimate object that attacked me!!! Ha ha&nbsp;ha I am gonna go and get&nbsp;the chainsaw...mwhahahahahahaahhahahaahhhahahahahahahahahahaha "I seee broken beds"....mwhahahaahahahahah, my revenge will be .....mwhahahahhaa  &nbsp;

       The nonsensical ramblings of a blonde weirdo.....have lately turned into nothing other than a load of shit, and for that I apologize profusely!! I have been incredibly tired, and unable to think, but that is no excuse, and I will return to writing normally, well as normal as it can be from me!&nbsp;   What has brought about this sudden realization,&nbsp;I hear myself ask, and well to be honest I literally think it was the sun! The feeling of the warm summer sun on my&nbsp;eyelids as&nbsp;I laid&nbsp;on my swing,the feeling of the sun of my skin, the&nbsp;sounds, the smells, everything!!   x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x     So yes, um.....Ooohhhh yes.......Sue has said that she will try and find the TaeBo video for me, to save me from purchasing it, so as soon as that is found and my parents go back to work, I WILL be losing weight, yay, hooray, yippeeeeee, a new  weighing less , but personality wise, the same old Natalie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   Sorry if you dont like my personality, but I am not gonna change that for  ANYONE!!!!!!!  &nbsp;    Ok so not a lot else to say today (that rhymes if you say it in a certain way.....well it does in my head anyway......ooh so does that,&nbsp;FREAKY!!)    Oh yes my quest (there I go again rhyming away)..I am not sure what day it will be but Shelley has said she will join me (theres another one look)...I will be off on a&nbsp;sunny day, for a walk, a walk from Littlehamptn into Worthing, all the way along the beach!!       mwhahahahahaahahahhaahahahhhahaahaahaahahahahahaaa (my very poor attempt at an evil laugh-sorry)     Hmmmm I think I may take a wander down the beach.....hmmm....maybe just maybe!!!      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx       &nbsp;

       Yes it is the return of the knobshite that is me - I am back blogging!    &nbsp;  Today I can't be arsed to be awake, I have no fucking energy and all I want to do is sleep, so that is what I might do!! But then again, I think that will be difficult, just my fucking luck!!    &nbsp;  Ahh yes so anyway.............I am again going shopping, I am turning into a shopahollic....it's quite scary, I seem to find myself in&nbsp;either Brighton, Worthing or Rustington at least 2 times a week! I have spent so much money, and yet I have nothing to show for it!!! lol!! But the good news is that my rents are taking me tomorrow, and they have said they will by me some stuff. Bless them    &nbsp;  Sorry if this seems agressive, I am just sleep deprived!!    &nbsp;  La la lal al ala al ala ala ala alalala a alala alala    &nbsp;  hmmmm ahhh yes what else was there............oh yes, spent this morning with Kim, see we dont see that much of each other, but I got a message from her this morning, and she asked me if I could also hear the sports day (among other things) then she asked if I would go down there, and we could spend the day together (or morning) as she is moving soon!! :-( i will miss Kim, but I shall see her a college!!!    &nbsp;  Yes so didnt get there until about 11.30, lol, just in time for the relays, lol, HIGHDOWN WON lol, how ironic, the first time us lot ain't there and highdown actually win somehting lol!!!    &nbsp;  That also reminds me of something else.........I am considering changing courses, as in I might not take PE!! The reason being although I love it, I don't want to lose my love for it. That sounds strange doesn't it, but what I mean is, I have found out that we have to do gymnastics, and we get filmed in everything we do. I am so shite at gymnastics, that would be fucking hilarious, and filming my attempt at PE, hahahahahahahahaha, you've been fucking framed here I come!!!!    &nbsp;  hmmm yes sooo, I am thinking about that at the moment, oh well time shall tell I suppose!!    &nbsp;  Thats about it I think, I am going to try and get an early..ish....night, well that is the plan!! lol    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Miss Keers signing off    &nbsp;  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      I really am so tired today, and have been for the past week, I just can't seem to sleep at night! Take last night for example, I was fucking knackard but I didnt fall asleep until about 3.30 am, then I woke up at 8! It has been going like this for some weeks now....what the fuck is wrong with me? I guess it has become a pattern, a pattern that is difficult to break, but why did it start in the first place? &nbsp; Oh yes I remember the last time this happened to me........hmmm I think I know the cause.....but what can I do? I mean if I stop doing what I am doing to make it this way, then I will be putting weight on, as it is I am not losing nearly enough!!!!!! &nbsp; :-( &nbsp; oh just ignore me, I am saying things I shouldnt be, as usual, I am going now &nbsp; XxX &nbsp;

        The body image test   Your score 5  You're not overjoyed with your physical appearance - to put it lightly. You feel quite uncomfortable in situations where you have to reveal a little skin, and likely go out of your way to avoid them altogether. You feel inadequate when you compare yourself to others, and may even go to extreme lengths (plastic surgery, severe dieting) to change the way you look. What it boils down to is this: the negative view you have of your looks is putting a serious damper on the way you live. You don't always wear the clothes you'd like because of insecurities, you may lack the confidence to pursue the people you're attracted to, and likely spend more time than you should worrying about physical flaws. The fact is, you're downright hard on yourself - but it doesn't have to be this way. Everyone struggles with insecurity during different periods of their lives; think of the number of movie stars and super models that spent an adolescence miserable, convinced they were hideously ugly. While we can't all be supermodels, we all have our unique style and look that makes us attractive. The world would be boring if we were all a bunch of Barbie and Ken dolls. No matter how we fit in to society's constantly changing beauty standards, we always judge ourselves much more harshly than other people do. We think we've got a huge schnoz; others think it's regal. We hate our freckles; other people think they're charming. Overall, there's one kind of beauty that never dies - inner confidence. Make it your mission!    &nbsp;   The how "blonde" are you test   Your score 5  You haven't got a drop of blonde in you...whether or not you've been blessed with golden tresses. You don't behave in any of the typical blonde ways, and probably don't fall for all that stereotypical "dumb blonde" nonsense. You know that using hair color to determine character is ridiculous, and would rather be seen for the unique individual that you are. How very un-blonde of you!  &nbsp;   The fitness test   Your score 100  Congratulations, you have reached the rank of 'fitness buff'! Your knowledge of exercise trivia is superb. You are ready to tailor a fitness routine that is optimal for you (if you haven't already).      The do you have a sense of humour test   Your score 70  Your sense of humor is pretty good. It may not be as wacky as that of some people (like us apparently) but you're pretty cool in our books! You can laugh at most things and maybe even get a kick out of the non-sense you say and do from time to time as well. Good for you! Hey, if you can't laugh at yourself, who can you laugh at right? Just kidding.      The $10 million test   Your score 5  Congratulations, you have personal integrity. Your answers revealed that you would not go all out to get your hands on ten million bucks. There may be one or two things that you would consider, but overall you're not willing to commit acts that are outright repulsive or might hurt anyone just to hit the jackpot. You likely realize that money does not equal happiness, and don't want to throw all your self-respect out the window for a windfall. You are not easily bought!   &nbsp;   The personal hygene test   Your Score 95  Germs are your enemy, and you've staged an all out war against them. You're usually sporting fresh undies and your hair is squeaky clean. You wouldn't dare eat something that fell on the floor, and the thought of using someone else's toothbrush gives you the jeebies. Of course, everyone has certain things they find particularly repulsive, but there's also the possibility of going too far - do you shower several times a day, even though you don't really need to? Do you feel horribly uncomfortable in less-than-spotless environments, like a friend's neglected bathroom? While it's certainly beneficial to maintain a high level of hygiene, scientists have recently discovered that society's obsession with cleanliness is resulting in weakened immune systems. If we never allow ourselves the slightest exposure to some creepy crawlies, our bodies don't learn that they are, in fact, harmless. So keep on washing your hair and changing that underwear…but you could relax a little!  &nbsp;   The friendship test   Your Score 95  Camaraderie is your specialty, and you tend to keep your pals at the very top of your priority list. When a friend is in need, whether for emotional support, a financial boost, or a simple helping hand, they can count on you to come through. You give the very best of yourself, and will actually put your own desires (and sometimes needs) on hold for the sake of a pal's happiness. Your friends surely appreciate your self-sacrificing nature and probably sing your praises. While it's wonderful to show such intense dedication, however, there could be some negative consequences to your high level of commitment; do you ever feel, for example, that you are giving much more than others give in return, or that you are being taken advantage of? While most people see the value of such a fab friend, there are also folks who will milk your generosity for all its worth - not always out of maliciousness, but sometimes because it's just too easy. There is also the danger of developing bitter feelings when you give up your own wants for those of others - a true friend, in fact, will not expect you to drop everything for them in every situation, and will surely respect your decision to put yourself first from time to time.   &nbsp;    l  o  v  e   y  e    xxxxxxxx &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Who decides what things are to be called?   For instants who decided to call a fork a fork? I'm guessing that it probably came from pitch fork as farming was common place in the times of our ancestors, but then you have to ask who thought up 'pitch fork'?  Words are strange things, I mean who decided what they meant, who sat round a table and decided that vivisection was to mean dissecting living animals? If no-one had thought of meanings for words, then no-one would be able to understand this, I wouldn't even be able to write it, it would just be sounds, sounds that we used to express feelings, thoughts emotions - and we could only understand that because of the facial expression that acompany them.  But then I supposee you have to wonder how we no that someone has a down turned lip, they aren't happy, or if someone is smiling they are happy! I think possible it's all in our instincts, we can instinctively tell how someone is feeling, maybe that is the remnense of our animalistic side - we know when to back off, when know when to surround and protect...  hmmm  love nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Ok so twice in one day may seem like an awful lot, but it hey.....!   I just had to comment on the sky outside of my window, its truly beautiful, and I mean really stunning! The clouds are kind of a a light pink, and tinged with cream! The are like floating puffs of candy floss! And then there is a part of a rainbow, it reminds me of the calm before the storm! Yes thats it they are storm clouds, oh I can only hope they don't live to recognise there title! I am a fan of storms, but in  WINTER  when you can stay in bed under your duvet, drinking tea and watching a crap movie. But not in the summer  PLEASE . I want the summer to return outside instead of just in my head!!!!!!!!!!  I can see blue sky trying to break through.  Hmmm amaybe just maybe this is the most beautiful I have ever seen our skies look, but no, actually there have been more magnificent times, but this is one of the top 20!!  My swing looks so tempting out there.....  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      A day like today is one to be forgotten, for it has brought nothing but grey skies and grey moods! Not of me you understand, for I live in a world where the sun in shining, the birds are singing and the summer is in full flow! But I have noticed that the moods of others tend to be grey on days like today!!…Oh I don’t even know what I am talking about anymore! Don’t listen to me I talk utter bollocks, but it is bollocks that makes sense to me, just not others, and so if it makes sense to me I shall carry on writing. I would stop if it didn’t make sense to me, because there would be no point in ME writing it!  Yes………………………………………………I have had too much time on my hands today, it is official, I am getting even madder, if it is possible, than I already was!!  I need to think of something…something to do…..I cannot sunbath, I cannot take a walk down the beach, I cannot go shopping, I have been running, I have been cycling, I have drunk tea, I have watched films, I have taken the piss out of my sister…..hmm I think I will go read! Lately I have done nothing but read, and for the first time in years, I again love to read!  Ok so I am going to read (wow)  Love ye Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today.........I finally got to read my Marilyn Monroe autobiography, I would have read it sooner but I had to finish this other book I was reading!! Anyways, yes so I also finished it today!! Ok so its not the longest book in the world, but she did die while she was writing it!! Yes so anyway, is absolutly brilliant, I have read other autobiographies, but I think is possible the best one!! I am not just saying that because I am a huge Marilyn fan, but it has hidden qualities. Not only was she a great actress, but she was also a fabulous writer, the words came alive on the page, it actually felt as though she was reading it to you herself, as if she where there in the room, speaking only to you!! I felt as though you got to know, not "Marilyn Monroe" but Norma Jean!!  .....yes so I will stop rambling now , as I have probably bored you all...........!!   "Its such a shame the world has lost someone so beauliful"  love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Another day in my life, another day in the world, another day!!  Again another beautiful evening draws in and a million thoughts are with me again, none of which make much sense or are relevant to each other, but they are there, and will always be there!!   Now we have finished school I seem to have more of my own thoughts, I am no longer thinking about what I need to think about, but what I want to think about! Well I mean I did think about what I wanted to think about, but there were also things that I didn’t, ok so those thoughts were less than my thoughts, but now I have even more space for my thinking!! That could be a dangerous thing, letting me have time to think, as it is I think far too much!!  I was thinking today, isn’t it weird how there are so many people in this world, and we only meet a fraction of them! I wonder if we meet some of the people we do because of coincidence or fate? I don’t know. I’m not a huge believer in the destiny being mapped out in the stars, and I am not a huge believer in fate, but I do have to question things sometimes! Like was that coincidence, and sometimes it seems as though it is not, that it is some sort of fate….Oh I don’t know……..and I suppose that’s part of the mystery that is life, and we’re not supposed to know…………  Anyway, I am off now, to go and think so more, before reading my book!!!  Love to y’all Nat

      As I sit here and look out onto the enchanting night before me, I can't help but wonder.............wonder about everything.   Why the clouds have a candy floss look about them. They look so beautiful, like little pink sugar puffs waiting to be eaten.  Why the evenings are more beautiful than the days at the moment.  Why life is full of confusion.  Why I find myself always being happy, I never no why.  Why I find myself writing on here day after day.  Why I have found some of the BEST FRIENDS a girl could ask for.  Why I am so weird.  Why I have the urge to go for an evening run.  Why the place around me is so peaceful and calm.  ......hmmmmm........  They name just a few of the thoughts in my very tiny brain at this precise moment in time, I could name some more, but there is such a thing known as  CONFIDENTIALITY!!   Yes well now that I have confused and bored you all to death.....I am going to continue some more, read on if you want know what it feels like to to be dying of bordem...........  I need a project, I need a project to stop my mind from turning into more of a custard than it already is! I suppose you could say these are my projects:-  reading and writing, confusing and boring,  running and cycling,  listening and talking,  shopping and ....well shopping!!!  Those are my projects....well not projects but definatly how I am spending my time......well I forgot to mention working....but who the hell wants to be reminded of that!!   Yes well......I am now off to read...I know read - an actual book, not magazine, but book, yes believe it or not  I love to read!!!   Love Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Ok  so  is it me or has this year gone really fast, it seems like only yetserday......ok so not exactly yesterday......but not a very long time ago that I woke up and it was my 16th Birthday! Now I sit a couple of months away from my 17th and I ask myself, "What exactly have I done this year?"...and he answer would be nothing....ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING....except eat far to much food! Wow...that will be a great thing to tell people when they ask "What have you been up to in your holidays?"...  "Oh me.....I ate far to much food and got even fatter than I already was.....HA"  ----------------------------------  See what I mean about all consuming, its always in my thoughts, I would say it is possibly my only unhappy...well not unhappy....but.....oh I don't no the word to describe it...annoying possibly.....thought!  ----------------------------------  Woohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      the good ol' sun is here........but for how long......hmmm "Stormy Weather on the way"...what is the point in weathermen...they only spoil the summer.......  see i think that if you wernt told all the time that rain is on the way, or it has been a washout summer, then people would look past the grey skies, and enjoy the energy that summer brings, if they let sunshine into there heart then in return this would please the Summer Fairies and they would make the sun outside, aswell as in your....or maybe I mean my.....heart!!!!  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
