       I saw THE VILLAGE tonight. Go to this link to learn more about it:   urlLink  http://thevillage.movies.go.com/       Weird. For some reason if I put a hot link connecting "THE VILLAGE" to the site I want you to look at, Blogger wipes out THE VILLAGE title so you can't see anything. Anywho, click on the above link to view the official THE VILLAGE site.     I did not read anything about it prior to seeing it because I wanted to keep the suspense of not knowing what it was about. Came home and was curious about the reviews and went to   urlLink  Rotten Tomatoes    and I could not believe it, the movie was panned! Huh? I thought it was very inventive, fresh, suspenseful, scary, dramatic, and romantic. All those elements in one movie? The acting worked for me and the cast was strong. I don't get it. If you saw it tonight (or any other time after this), what did you think?      urlLink

               I have never been able to figure out what this saying means. "The world is my oyster". Not quite sure why I am thinking about it right now, but I decided to do a search. The very first entry, this is what it said:        Q.    Did Shakespeare coin the phrase "the world is my oyster"?           A.    Yes. The quote comes from Shakespeare's only comedy set in      England      , "The Merry Wives of Windsor":         Why, then the world's mine oyster,  Which I with sword will open.  Pistol -- (2.2.3-4)       I read Shakespeare in high school, and I believe in college, but if I were playing Jeopardy right now there is no way that I would have remembered that this quote was coined by Shakespeare. Fancy though that it stuck in my head. The memory is a boggling thing. My memory has changed over the years, can't remember stuff quite like I used to. I believe it’s because of the medication that I take, but none-the-less one can't quite stop worrying about whether or not they will get Alzheimer's in their golden years.   I don’t know which is worse, The Big A or The Big C.   Nearly my entire adult life I have had such bad luck that I am hoping, starting today, that as I enter the middle phase of my life that my luck will change and among other things, allow me to stay healthy till the end of my days.   I believe that I have paid my dues, in full.

        It's late, thus the   urlLink  Lateness Of The Hour    is formed. I recently purchased that domain to create a web site dedicated especially for you late night owls (and I also include those dastardly early morning risers and those in between). However, since it (my web site) will take me some time to create and have it viewable for my lovin' public, this blog will have to tide me (and you) over.   Normally, I would discuss random tidbits about   urlLink  insomnia    and what you can do during your late night prowls, but what currently is on my mind is not sleep deficiencies, but   urlLink  heart break   . Yes, I am one of love lost's children and recently fresh. It hurts bad, and I need a release. Sure, I am currently being loving supported by   urlLink  my close friends   , but there are times and just random situations where I don't feel like actually  talking  to anyone. Writing can be a very powerful instrument and also oddly enough a healing tool. Not as good as   urlLink  chocolate   , but heck, fairly close in my book.   One can only hope that this blog will help remedy my shattered heart. Maybe it will help you with yours too.     urlLink     As you wish...

            I have so many things I need to do. With my current state of brokenheartedness, I haven't done sh!t in nearly a month.  The most important thing, keep submitting my resume for a job.  I have not worked on at all in a month. My goal is to start up again this week. I believe I forgot to mention it, but Todd did come through with a $1,000, so that is why I haven't been so Johnnette On The Spot about the job situation because it's amazing how far I can stretch that money out.  I need to sell my convertible.  I had it on   urlLink  Craig's List   , but it has since expired.  I also have to consider posting it on say something like,   urlLink  AutoTrader.com    and, ugh....eBay. I really want to try and sell it on my own first, pay NO listing fees nor have ANY commission taken out.  Wish me luck.  I need to go to Planned Parenthood. I have to finish my last Hep B vaccine shot (you have to do a series of three) and also get a pap smear. My fave. Since I currently do not have any health insurance (I know BAD), PP has been heaven sent for me. I am very thankful for their services.  I am not going to get into this because this is far too personal, but I am having a battle with the ultimate worst......the I.R.S. Enough said, believe me, STRESS CITY.  Started taking Estro Natural, A   urlLink  Walgreen's    product based off of   urlLink  Estroven    Extra Strength. Hopefully this product will help me with my hot flashes. Apparently "  urlLink  Black Cohosh Extract   " is the wonder herb when it comes to this type of situation. I do not know what it is, but it was in every box of "peri/menopause" type of remedy that Walgreen's had. I will do some research on it and report in another blog listing.  Other than that, no new news or happenings. I am bored, procrastinating, unmotivated, and well, feeling like a loser. Other than that, I still have my positive attitude.

       I miss  urlLink Los Gatos . I used to live there many years ago by myself, in two different places. The first place was SO small, 400 square feet. It was all that I could afford at the time on my salary and driving a brand new  urlLink MR2 . I made the best of it, and I also mainly stayed at my boyfriend's house in the  urlLink Santa Cruz Mountains . I loved waking up and having a bunch of deer right outside, very cool. Beautiful mountains and trees. Sigh. Yes, I miss it. Perhaps I will live there one day again.      EW wanted to go to the  urlLink Los Gatos Art & Wine Festival on Main Street . I was all for it. We planned on going the day before, but we ran late (as usual), so we made the attempt today. Of course we were late again, but we managed to catch at least 10 minutes of it. Nothing special. Overpriced brick-a-brac. I want a couple of new gold toe rings, and snagged the business card of the little  urlLink toe ring store  at the festival. I purchased from them before. I love my toe rings. I have about four of them and have been wearing them for many, many, many years. I think feet are ugly, but adding shiny gold toe rings on them seem to change them from BLAH To AH. Whatever. LOL      EW saw and spoke to one lad that she recognized. The funny thing though, she could not remember his name (they went out on a date once). Considering that EW has a name/face database in her head and can remember stuff beyond comprehension, I could not believe that she could not remember this dude's name. She called a friend to figure it out. Too funny.      Beyond that, nothing really exciting was going at the festival so we decided to walk, walk, and walk around  urlLink Los Gatos  (hence the painful blisters). The Town itself is not that large so you can walk the entire distance in a good hour or two. Nice walking workout. We stopped off at the  urlLink Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company  and I picked up an iced mocha/banana coffee. Not bad, but not great. What is this? Strike two. Two coffee drinks in a weekend? Rare, and out of place for me. However, now I am on a quest. I am determined to find an awesome coffee drink. That's all I need, ANOTHER thing to keep me up at night!      Since the breakup, I have not been eating well. I'm not talking about eating junk food, I am talking about eating in general. I lost about seven pounds, and now I think I gained a couple back, but I am just not eating that often. I simply do not have an appetite. I think the hot days are affecting me as well. After EW and I parted ways, I was starving to death since I did not eat a thing all day, so I went to  urlLink Happi House . Had a 2 for 1 coupon. I currently live with my Mother and we love our Happi House 2 for 1. The chicken salad? I love it. I usually purchase an extra pint.      I guess I have always been a coupon person, trying to be thrifty when I can, but overall I am not a cheapskate. Far from it. Not being able to control my finances put me in trouble in the past, and now in current time, so believe me, I am trying to bust out of this negative mold and be more conscious of my future. Right now, it's not looking so good. I feel like a loser. I never thought I would be in the position that I am in. All I can say is that I am due for something good. I thought my relationship with C was the start of a brand new future, new hope for me...but that was abruptly cut off without an explanation that I can even understand. Leaving me in the manner that he did, unforgettable and unforgivable.      I digress. Back to my Los Gatos story. Actually, this is probably a good time to tell you. I am a lot like the main character in  urlLink CARRIE PILBY . I just finished that book and I connected with that character in a way I have never done before. It was as if I was reading about me. Very weird. Anyway, funny thing. I did a Google search on CARRIE PILBY because I wanted to see what else the author wrote and lo and behold! The Author, Caren Lissner, actually has a  urlLink web site  and moreover,  urlLink a blog ! LOL I'll give her some props on my blog, excellent book Caren! I will definitely read any other books you have.      Back to what I was trying to tell you...I usually think about three or four things at once. I always have. I start talking about one thing and switch to another thing. I am sure my blog is like that as well, in "scattered talk" so forgive me in advance if you are totally lost and do not know what the fuck I am talking about. Stay with me people! FOCUS.      Time to start a new book! Wouldn't you know? EW and I went to  urlLink Border's  in Los Gatos today. I picked up  urlLink LIFE OF PI  and  urlLink THE LOVELY BONES . I have SO many books at home that I need to read, but I just can't help it. I love books, bookstores, and drum roll, spending money. Shopping is definitely mental therapy for me. Border's had a "Buy 1, Get the 2nd 50% Off" so WTF, I took the plunge. By the way, I know that I just mentioned I am trying to be careful about my money, and the truth is, I HAVE BEEN. So please, no advice mail about me buying two books. Honest, that is all that I have spent (besides the couple lipsticks on eBay).      Speaking of ex-boyfriends. I thought of one special ex, MT. I had a six-year relationship with him. He was 14 years older than me at the time. I was with him from my early 20's to about 28. I loved him, I loved him quite a bit. Although, even though I was with C for only two months, I loved C even more. Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I did live with MT in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Beautiful three-story house. He had some serious bucks. Really, the only boyfriend that I have ever had that had some major $$$. That did not matter though, I loved him for who he was and how he treated me. He was a good man. I think it's sad that I haven't seen him in over 10 years. We talked a couple of years ago, a mutual friend of ours had died, but we did not meet up. We talked about it, but it never happened, and then I lost touch with him. The reason why I bring him up is because he had an office close to where EW lives. I was wondering if his office is still there. I want to look him up and say hi. Just so you know, we parted ways in good terms. I am SURE he would be completely surprised that I never married. Simple fact, no one ever asked nor would I have said yes. The only man I would have married in a heartbeat was C, but alas, that isn't going to happen.  Where are the older single men on Blogger? I swear, about 98% of the blogs that I read are either teens or students. No MEN. Well, there are some, but they are MARRIED. Where are the 28 - 40 yo SINGLE MEN? I would also have to bet that I am probably the only 37 yo SINGLE woman blogging on Blogger. Prove me wrong ladies!      I watched  urlLink Bad Boys 2 .  urlLink What a piece that was . I wonder how many times they said the word "fuck", "nigga", "mother fucker", etc. You get the idea. It seriously must have been off the charts. I have  urlLink Netflix  so I ordered this film. Thank God because I would had been pissed if I had to pay $9.50 for it. Now, I am a reasonable individual. I can suspend my belief in movies, but the car chase scene they had was just SO over the top it was completely unreal. I am sure that if any cop in my city pulled that type of crap, they would not have an ass to sit on. Anyway, do not bother watching this movie, go mow your lawn instead.      My sleeping pattern is absolutely and completely screwed up. I wanted to try and get it together this week, but it's not happening. I will try soon. You are going to hear me talk A LOT about insomnia and poor sleeping habits so get used to it. That is what this blog is about, THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR.  For now, I have been going to bed later and later and later. Today will be no different. I am going to bed at 7 a.m.      Just so you know usually from Thursday - Friday I do not write my blog in real time. Thank God for Blogger's "set your date and time to whatever you want you lazy bastard" feature. I am actually writing Sunday's blog on Wednesday, but hey no biggie since I've only had ~93 people look at my blog. I am working on building readership by doing all the "blog things" popular bloggers do, but no matter. I enjoy writing my thoughts out and the things that I did in the day. I like to spew venom and kiss out love. I used to do it in my journal(s) so I don't really see what the difference is except for the fact that my thoughts are public. I haven't lied, I am being real, but I am not putting it ALL out there, so it isn't a big deal to me.  I am really not a private person anyway.  My business is usually all out there.  I have nothing to hide.  Perhaps one day I will have a "secret blog", but ahhhhhhhhhhh, more work. LOL This blog is good enough for now. Ack, I am stopping here with this train of thought, I am boring myself.      I will have to mention KK in a future blog session. I am thinking about going out for a drink with him. Not sure yet. I am currently ambivalent about my entire dating situation.  Men suck.   But I still love them anyway.       I'll leave you all with this...       "Where is that perfect COFFEE dammit!?"

       Today was nice. EW dragged me out of the   urlLink  Bat Cave    and we ended up doing quite a few things. It was very nice to be distracted for so long and not think about C and cry my eyes out. I actually had a nice time, laughed, and enjoyed  just getting out . To boot, it was a beautiful California day.  We weren't completely sure what we wanted to do. We are both easy going, casual, on the fly type of individuals. I just don't stress about doing things. I love to do things   urlLink  "on the fly".    We decided to eat some dinner first, so I suggested   urlLink  Willow Street Cafe, the restaurant I went with CV not too long ago   . However, this time I got it right and went to the Westgate location and was able to use my   urlLink  aforementioned    2 for 1 Entertainment card.  EW ate what I had the last time, and this time around I was in a MEAT mood, so I opted for the Three Sausages and Three Mushroom pizza. It was good, but not great (it actually gave me   urlLink  smelly toots    later, hee hee). As for them REALLY putting  three  different types of mushrooms on it, nah, don't believe it. All the mushrooms were tiny and looked like normal sliced white button mushrooms to me. There were supposed to be some   urlLink  portabella and shittake   , nope, did not see any. Normally, I would have said something, but at the time it was not a big deal AND I did not feel like   urlLink  eating chef spit    so I left it as is.  After dinner we went to   urlLink  Old Navy   , but I did not see  anything  that I liked. Normally, I would want to buy out the entire store. Good thing.  Next up was   urlLink  Starbucks   . I tried for the first time the:   urlLink  Frappuccino caramel coffee and creamy caramel blended with ice, topped with whipped cream and caramel sauce    (however, it was the   urlLink  "lite" version   ). My advice? Skip the "lite" version and go full throttle. I rarely drink coffee so the next time I decide to treat myself I want to taste full pleasure going down and not this funky tasting medina.           "Eat Me"     We decided to see a movie at Century 22.   urlLink  Alien vs. Predator   . It was okay. You can wait till it comes out on DVD. After reading the (bad) reviews on   urlLink  Rotten Tomatoes   , I decided that had I directed the movie, I would have changed nearly the entire premise. I am tired of writing right now, but I will later post what I think that movie should have been about. Do not read it if you do not want to read spoilers.  Only until I was driving home did I think about C, and sigh, got sad. Better though, I lasted seven to eight hours in distracted bliss. Hey, I like that name, good name for another weblog or a band.            Thanks to:   urlLink  http://www.enlightenedbeings.com/samadhi_coaching.html    for the borrowed image.

          urlLink 2004 OLYMPICS - ATHENS, GREECE                  CNN - Opening Night:   urlLink  http://www.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/13/olympics/     Okay, it can't just be me who thought the Athens Olympic torch lighting ceremony looked like a joint in a roach clip. Did you notice that as well? Look at the picture of the flame holder and tell me that does not look like a joint/roach clip!? And no, I am not a   urlLink  stoner   .  Hm. I have been searching for a picture (of the flame holder/joint) for the past half hour on Google and I can not find one! As a matter of fact, I can barely find ANY images from the opening ceremonies! Just a couple, but not even what I would consider the highlights. WEIRD. I wanted to find an image of that woman's glowing belly as well. Then it dawned on me....apparently this Olympic really isn't that big of a success (as so far). There are so many   urlLink  empty seats    in nearly every event that I have watched! Again, WEIRD. Is it because of potential terrorist threats? Poor PR from the Greeks because it took them so long to build?  This journalist from the Sun Times lists possibilities as to why the numbers for the Olympics are just not happening. Olympics on Tape Delay:   urlLink  http://www.suntimes.com/output/roeper/cst-nws-roep17.html          Good heavens! After an  hour  of searching on Google, six pages in, I FINALLY found   urlLink  a picture of the Olympic Torch   . Of course, it isn't that big and not in an angle that proves my point, but none the less, this picture is going to have to do for now. By the way, the only hitch in the opening ceremonies according to one of the news reporters was that the flame actually blew OUT a little while after it was lit! LOL I guess next time they have to go for a little Maui Wowie instead.          urlLink      "Whoa dude! Let's go party in Greece!"

       I was so tired last night I fell asleep around midnight.  Unusual for me since for the past month I have been going to bed around 6 - 7 a.m. and waking up around 1 - 2, sometimes later.  Being broken hearted sucks.  For the first week I thought I was going to pull out of it, I was angry, I felt strong, and now...I feel incredibly sad, lost.  Since I have not heard from C I am beginning to realize in full that the most incredible feeling I have ever felt in my life is gone.  It took me over 10 years to find him, the loss and pain is severe.      Being that I fell asleep during the prime hours for the Perseid Meteor Shower, I missed it.  That is upsetting.  It is 5:37 a.m. PDT right now (as I write this), I went outside and the sun is just starting to rise.  Absolutely no meteors can be seen (at least to the naked eye).  I was under the impression that it would last till 6 a.m., but that could have been east coast time.  I am a little out of it right now since I just woke up about half an hour ago, so forgive me if I do not reread articles to point out fact.  I'm just not into it.

       I am not really a "hobby" person per se. I do have many and a variety of interests, but there isn't one thing that I am especially good at. At least in my humble opinion. I am a bulldog in business with negotiating, but since it has been a while and I am not employed at the moment, that does not count. I am talking about personal stuff.  For instance, I can do a cart wheel, but I can't do a cart wheel on the reverse side. Wait, bad example because I am sure many can not even do a regular cart wheel. Okay, better example, I wish I could draw, but I can't draw to save my life. My   urlLink  stick figures    are cute and I can draw a   urlLink  Fizz Gig    type of creature, but beyond that I would have to stick to my day job. Oh, wait...LOL  I guess my one true talent would be writing. The reason why I state this isn't because I am some   urlLink  vain creature   , but because I have had quite a few people tell me that I have a knack for writing. Mostly I write "  urlLink  Dear Crook   " letters or pissed off e-mails to (ex) boyfriends, but I think I can modestly say that I have a keen sense of humor and offbeat type of writing style that I can agree with said complimentors.  I am far too lazy to write a book, just not in the cards nor do I even have the slightest interest, so my blog will have to do. I am creating a concept for my   urlLink  http://www.thelatenessofthehour.com    web site, but since I procrastinate like crazy, heaven only knows when I will actually flip that sucker live. It's currently live, but it only has a home page. Heck, it's not even a home, it's more like a closet without the lights on.      The reason why I bring all this up is because I keep finding the most amazing, but horrific images on the Internet. Funny, sad, complex, dramatic, bizarre, the adjectives are endless. I have a bizarre sense of humor and also I like looking at weird stuff. I don't get off on it sexually if that is what you are thinking (I don't even understand that train of thought), but I guess I am just curious as to how the mind works on every single person. The way YOU see life or what your version of life is.      For instance, what do you think was going through this artist's head while s/he was creating this image? Like the dolls, it is so offbeat and bizarre, but I can't help but look at it and think to myself, "Why can't I draw??"        urlLink        Perhaps McDonald's should rethink their new Chicken McNuggets w/white meat?

       I do believe I am the first person to NOT find something on the Internet. If you find it for me, I will eat my flip flop. I am looking for a picture of "The Leaving Dance" as performed by Meg Ryan's crazy woman character in the excellent movie   urlLink  RESTORATION   .  You see, I feel like doing The Leaving Dance and I thought it would be appropriate to show you what it looks like. For now, I will leave you with Meg's crazy character and an image of the movie itself.     urlLink     urlLink      "Not the Safety Dance! The LEAVING Dance!"     I IMed with MO tonight. Sweet boy! I missed him, haven't talked to my pal in a long time. He sounds well, dating a new girlie, and I am glad that   urlLink  Incubus    rocked hard for him last night.  I think I am going to start journaling (is that a word?) as to what my mood was for the day. I know I have my moods posted on the left bar of my blog, but just for my sake I would like to have some sort of record to see how long it takes for me to snap out of this funk that I am in since C broke up with me. It took me several years to get over MT and TR, and I sincerely hope that is not going to be the case here with C. I do not have that kind of time anymore, and more importantly I do not want to be in pain and despair any longer than I have too. I will grieve, I will move through my pain, and I will branch out again. No man is worth feeling terrible for when I believe he has made a regrettable mistake.  My mood changed today into something worse and I am bothered by it. Heard some news that should have been happy, but it did not strike me as such, more of deep concern. I have never felt this way before with this individual and I am not sure on what level why I am feeling this way. Something is not right. I am taken aback because this is not consistent behavior with this individual and admittedly, I am disappointed. We'll see what happens. I want everything to be fine and without any future heartache, I just hate it when I feel something like this in the core of my soul and it simply is not sitting well with me.  I have been on an   urlLink  eBay    kick again. When I get depressed I am one of those depression shoppers. It's an addiction for me that I have been working on for many years and actually have been VERY good at for the past four years. My control has been strong and I have been very proud of myself. I rarely, if ever, step into a mall and if I do I try to make sure that someone is with me.  However, I am cutting myself a little slack and turned to eBay for some relief. Since my funds are in limited supply these days, my purchases have been exceedingly small, mostly cosmetics, lipstick. Or, I will bid on something, but keep my bid very low and more than likely will be bidded out. It's just the act of me "shopping", finding something I like, the desire of wanting it, and then I am done with it. In past years it would have been a completely different outcome. I would have bought it no matter what the cost. Now, I don't even care anymore. I have changed so much in some things and in others, I feel hopeless.  There is a  urlLink Perseid Meteor Shower    happening right now, I think I will go out and explore tonight and find a place where I can watch. I absolutely love   urlLink  Astronomy    and yes,    urlLink  Astrology    . Do I believe that there is life out there in the other galaxies?    urlLink  ABSOLUTELY!      I would love to sit down and have a conversation with    urlLink  Prof. Stephen Hawking    . Although his appearance and robot voice would freak me out a little bit, I am sure with the direction of the conversation and just the awe of his intellect I would swiftly be won over.

       Today is RB's, oops, RF's birthday.  Happy Birthday Hoochie Momma!  First marriage, then a birthday, then a baby carriage?? :o)  I am going to have to get used to calling her RF from now on. It still trips me out that she is married. My hootchie married? Wow, too trippy. Recent 7/8/04. Beautiful   urlLink  wedding    and   urlLink  reception    in   urlLink  Lake Tahoe   . I had a wonderful time, it was heartfelt and I am very happy for her. Oh yes, her dress was absolutely fabulous, but forgot to view her shoes! And, THE RING! I will have to ask to see her  urlLink Precious  soon  .  All I have to do is purchase their gift. Gotta get over to   urlLink  Crate &amp; Barrel    and/or   urlLink  Macy's    this week. I went shopping last Thursday with EW at  urlLink Valley Fair  specifically     to purchase her gift, but of course we were late, had to eat dinner, buy   urlLink  make-up   , eat  urlLink Cold Stone  (omg, Cake Batter!)   and what was that I was supposed to buy? LOL    I am such a goober. I called RF tonight to wish her a Happy B'day and well, she was gracious enough to tell me that it wasn't until next month. D'oh! It's the perimenopause I'm telling you!! At least she knows that I am thinking about her. :o)       urlLink       ~ For now I dedicate these images to RF ~   urlLink

       I am bored. I need to change "things" in my life and I need to start now. With C and I no longer together, the excitement that I briefly felt is gone and has left me in a state of flux. I will talk about this further in other blogs.     urlLink       Also, I do believe I have started to go through "  urlLink  The Change of Life   ". Yes, menopause. Sigh. I am only 37, so I do not think that it's actually menopause, but there is a condition called  perimenopause . Guess what ladies? I found out that perimenopause can last up to SIX to TEN YEARS!!!! {faints} Yes, you read that right. Another reason for my somber mood. Middle age has finally hit me. I have listed the symptoms below and yep, I am pretty much suffering from ALL of them. I was spared no expense from the Meno Gods. The hot flashes are especially fun as I am currently walking around with a   urlLink  Japanese hand fan    and during the day/night I have a white   urlLink  desk fan    on me. I fear if I do not cool down I will   urlLink  melt like another certain woman we all know   .         "Perimenopause is the period of gradual changes that lead into menopause. It affects a woman's hormones, body, and feelings. It can be a stop-start process that may take months or years. "Climacteric" is another word for the time when a woman passes from the reproductive to the non-reproductive years of her life".       Souce: Planned Parenthood         Here is a list of the symptoms (and further information on perimenopause/menopause:       As most women approach menopause, their menstrual periods become irregular - they happen closer together and/or further apart.       Other common symptoms include:       Achy joints, hot flashes, temporary and minor decrease in the ability to concentrate or recall, changes in sexual desire, extreme sweating, headaches, frequent urination, early wakening, vaginal dryness, mood changes, insomnia, night sweats, conditions commonly associated with PMS — premenstrual syndrome.      A woman may have one, some, or none of these symptoms. Symptoms can be very unpredictable and disturbing if a woman doesn't know they are related to menopause.     A woman's experiences during menopause may also be influenced by other life changes:       Children leaving home, changes in domestic, social, and personal relationships; changes in identity and body image, divorce or widowhood, retirement, increased anxiety about illness, aging, and death; loss of friends, loved ones, and financial security, increased responsibility for aging parents, anxiety about loss of independence, disability, or loneliness.    Increasing numbers of perimenopausal women also have young children to care for. Whatever the cause or circumstance, the conditions women experience before and after menopause are very real and sometimes need medical attention. While 10-15 percent of American women experience no symptoms of menopause, another 10-15 percent become physically or emotionally disabled for various periods of time by some of these symptoms of life changes. And all women face increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis after menopause.    Perimenopause Is Unpredictable.     Perimenopause may begin as early as 35 . It usually starts about two years earlier for women who smoke than for women who don't.    Women reach menopause at different times. The timing is not related to race, class, pregnancy, breastfeeding, fertility patterns, the birth control pill, height, age of menarche (first period), or age at last pregnancy.             SIGH...THE FUN BEGINS...  urlLink          The above information was taken from:   urlLink  Planned Parenthood   .

       My friend CV rocks. She is the only person I keep in touch with from   urlLink  high school   . Probably the only one I ever will, I will know her till the day I die. She is like a sister to me. Sometimes we don't talk for a while, but it never matters, as soon as we do it's like we have never been away from each other. We never even fight. We have a mature, healthy friendship. One that I deeply cherish. For a   urlLink  Taurus   , she is all right. :) Okay, enough mushy stuff.  CV had two free passes to see a   urlLink  Century Theater    movie. Since we already saw "  urlLink  THE VILLAGE   " the week before we decided on "  urlLink  OPEN WATER   ". Actually, I did. CV wanted to see "  urlLink  THE BOURNE SUPREMACY   ", but I already saw that with my friend EW. I also was not in the mood to see a movie right away and needed some more time to myself. Friday I was just not up to par, still feeling deep grief about C. It comes and goes, but this week it was bad. Since I had supressed most of my feelings the week before, it's starting to hit me now. More on this later.  CV was way cool, understood, and said "OPEN WATER" would be fine. I drove to her house, picked her up, and then we went to   urlLink  Willow Street    in   urlLink  Willow Glen    for dinner. It was excellent!  I had:  Vodka Prawn Fettuccine and a glass of the Meridian Chardonnay        Prawns, spinach, and oven dried tomatoes tossed with pine nuts, fresh basil, fettuccine and vodka tomato-cream sauce.     CV had:  Wild Mushroom Pesto Penne and a glass of the Salmon Creek Merlot      Seasonal mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes tossed in a pesto cream sauce and garnished with toasted pine nuts and fresh basil.     I brought my  urlLink Entertainment Card  because I thought we could get a 2 for 1 dinner, but I goofed. It wasn't valid at that particular Willow Street (d'oh!).      Discount Description:  Enjoy one complimentary LUNCH OR DINNER ENTREE when a second LUNCH OR DINNER ENTREE of equal or greater value is purchased.  (Membership Card or Coupon provided in the Entertainment Book is required to obtain discount) Dine in only, valid anytime, Westgate location only.   Restaurant Information:  At Willow Street Westgate, you'll find the kind of wood-fired pizza & specialty pastas that have made Willow Street a Bay Area tradition. We also feature terrific salads, fresh fish, homemade desserts, our own World Beer Cup winning microbrews &amp; a full bar. At Willow Street, you'll find a large, comfortable patio, perfect for private parties.     Oh well, next time CV and I will go to the one at Westgate (I would have a link here for Westgate Mall, but I searched high and low on the 'net and there is nothing to be found on this mall. Absolutely no web site. It's located in  urlLink Campbell ,  urlLink California . If you find it,  urlLink please tell me !).    Back to   urlLink  OPEN WATER   . What did I think about it? I thought it was good, not great, but it certainly had me thinking during and after the movie about their predicament. I am still thinking about it. Since I do not want to ruin it for you if you have not seen it, I cannot comment too much, but I agree with pretty much all the positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Take a peek:   urlLink  OPEN WATER REVIEWS           urlLink          My only beef with the movie is that it was filmed on  urlLink DV, digital video . Ugh. Poor quality, drove me nuts. Too fuzzy for me. Apparently they shot the entire film for $130,000 USD, so hey, what do you expect? TR paid MORE than that for   urlLink  KWOON   , but that is another story (  urlLink  read blog date August 5, 2004   ).

       I received this message from Blogger Support today:                    Hi there,          Unfortunately we don't provide support for template modifications.  However, this sort of layout problem can happen when sidebar (or center column) content is too wide, for example.  Also, this layout problem only seems to affect Internet Explorer 6 - it looks fine in Mozilla Firefox and Safari/Mac.      Good luck,   Blogger Support            IT WORKED!       Thank you Blogger Support!      My picture for "The Iron Chef" was too big.  I edited it down to 50% of its original size and voila, my blog is back on track.

       To prove that even though I am pissed off and in a bad mood, I still have my humor.  I will ALWAYS have my humor,  and  my happiness.  If C thinks I am not happy, he can suck on this!

       Great.  My blog format is all screwed up and Blogger Support has not answered me yet.  I just posted "~ No Respect ~" and it's not showing up.  Neither is the title for my first AudioBlog.  Then, that HUGE blank space from the top to the near bottom of my blog is still there.      WTF is going on??

       I was blazing mad today, I still am. I am normally a very easy going person, laid back. Calm. That is why my name is BLISS. However, there is one person on this planet who really rubs me the wrong way. I normally do not publish names, but with him I'll make an exception. I have been silent (publicly) about him for all these years, but not anymore. I am fighting back because he is an unclassy piece of work. My friends, my family all think he is self absorbed loser, and they are right. I cannot believe that it took me years to figure this out, to finally accept him for what he is.  I always had love in my heart for him, he completely fooled me.  I wasted nearly four years of my life with this bastard. He has placed an extreme amount of stress in my life. I used to love him, very, very deeply, but when I found out that he was leading a double life, had another girlfriend the same time he was with me, you can bet that all of that changed my viewpoint towards him.  All that I write is not made up, no lie. Everything that I state is FACT. If he finds my site and reads this, knowing him with his delusional mind, he will object.  He is such a coward he could never come out and admit that he is the bastard that he is.  Not do anything to rectify the situation.  I cannot even begin to state how laughable he is. The lies that he created, the things he did to me, how could anyone make stuff like this up? Straight out of Jerry Springer he is. I won't even get into his other ex-girlfriend, serious white trash. And no, I do not say that as a cat's meow, it's the truth and I have a number of people who would back my words up. At the time I did not understand it, a 19-year old stripper? But now I completely understand. Both are seriously destructive behavior type people who lie and are completely self absorbed. They belong with each other. Oh wait, he told me that she is pregnant now, and of course, not married. See what I mean?  For all I know he could be the Father.  Trust me, it would NOT surprise me in the least.  The problem, the stress he has created for me? MONEY and lots of it. Over four years ago he was working on a film project and was in financial trouble. His laser company at the time was not doing as well as it did in the past (this was during the dot com bust). At that time I was making a nice sum of money, was absolutely in love with him, and being the kind soul that I am loaned money to him. $20,000, two separate checks. He also owed me another $5,ooo for some presents that he said he would buy for me (I paid for them) and other various loans of hundreds of dollars that I gave to him. Boy, was I an  IDIOT . I will never be able to forgive myself for being taken by a con man. I cannot even BEGIN to list the pain and suffering I have gone through for this jackass and the way he treats me in return? Completely without respect.  This is the thanks I get.  He has laughed in my face, flipped me off, told me point blank that he was not going to pay me back, countless lies, countless times of "I have your money" and never following through. I ALWAYS have to ask him for money, he never, ever offers it to me on his own.  Today was no exception. I was so mad at him for failing to transfer funds into my account, yet again. He told me last week he would do it. He did not. I contacted him several other times, and he still didn't do it.  Now, supposedly he is 100 miles deep in the Mojave Desert. Do I believe any of this? Absolutely not. It's always about HIM. Todd first.   urlLink  TODD ROY   . Liar extraordinaire. He tells me on occasion when he is feeling God knows what, that he is "sorry and that he understands what it feels like".        YEAH RIGHT! SAVE IT YOU LIAR!      You don't believe me folks?  I have the Instant Messages.  I am sure he has tons and tons of mine screaming my head off.  I have a signed contract from him promising my money to be paid in full LAST YEAR.  To date, the payment that I have received?  It probably totals less than $5,000.  This is over a span of going on five years!  I was "supposed" to be paid back ONE MONTH later for this loan, that is why I did it.  I was assured this.  I simply cannot keep my cool with him anymore, there is only so much a person can take.  I do NOT deserve this!!!    After knowing him for so many years and knowing that he lies like no one I have ever known (he is completely pathological), he can sit there and seriously tell me these things with a straight face. I so do not believe him anymore. NOTHING that he says impresses me nor nothing that he says I believe. Bottom line? PAY ME BACK IN FULL, then I will believe whatever you have to say.  All I have to say is this.....karma is a BITCH!  p.s. He actually bought a half million dollar house while he still owed me money. GUTSY isn't he? He also co-signed a loan for a car for his white trash girlfriend, and Lord only knows what else he bought her with MY money. The house has since foreclosed and he went bankrupt. Now he is trying to tell me that if I sue him he is protected by the bankruptcy. NICE OF HIM HUH?  He was kind enough to tell me today after I raged at him that I was "worse than AmEx".  AmEx never LOVED him.  My jaw is clinched tight.  p.p.s. Any lawyers out there? Any advice you can give me?  When I get my job, the first thing on my To Do List is to SUE his ass off.  I will take everything that he owns and I bet at that time he'll sit back and wonder why is this happening to HIM.  Pathetic.

       I spent the past two hours reading other blogs on Blogger. So far, I am not impressed. Way too many, and way too many from young writers. Can you even read what they type with the "bz" and "haz" type of writing. Annoying. Ah well, I suppose writing one's interest at whatever age is a good thing. Better to create than be destructive and take drugs.      I just feel rather alone. I recently turned 37 (my birthday is July 12th), but look like I am in my 20's. Offline, I attract young men.  urlLink Online , I attract men older than me. I've already been in a relationship with a man 14 years older than me (when I was in my early 20's). I do believe that caused me to be in the situation I am today. Perhaps one day I will blog about it. Do I have regrets? Yes, I do. But at the same time I don't. It (the experience) has made me who I am today.      Back to what I originally wanted to blog about. I was reading another blog (sorry to the blogger, I do not remember your blog otherwise I would have credited you) and he had a link to this movie:  urlLink SAW . Mucho scary movie and I love scary movies! Best yet?  urlLink CARY ELWES ! Now, I am not usually star-struck nor have movie star crushes, but I have had a crush on Cary Elwes ever since  urlLink THE PRINCESS BRIDE  came out. He basically has been in crap movies since and has gained weight, but I don't care, Cary rocks! He can "as he wishes me" anytime!         Why is Michael Shanks AND Cary Elwes married when they belong to me?       Another crush of mine?  urlLink Michael Shanks from Stargate: SG 1 . Oh, that is a story in itself. So much to blog about, so little time. Well, in my case I do have time (I am currently  urlLink unemployed ), I am just lazy in putting my thoughts down on e-paper. Admittedly though, with this blog, I am doing MUCH better than my  urlLink previous .  urlLink Angell  should be proud of me.        Poor Cary, he forgot to call me so I had to chain him up.          urlLink "SAW"       Synopsis: Adam (Leigh Whannell) suddenly wakes to find himself chained to a rusty pipe. Chained to the opposite side of the room is another bewildered captive, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). Between them is a dead man lying in a pool of blood, holding a .38 in his hand. Neither man knows why he has been abducted. Their only chance is to work together, decipher the clues, and hope that the "Jigsaw" killer has given them enough time before they are forced to kill each other.

       Sigh.  I still have this huge blank area on my blog.  One poor Blogger soul wrote to me yesterday and said the same thing is happening to him.  I wrote to Blogger Support, but I have yet to hear from anyone yet.  I wonder what the dealio is.  If you know, please do share.

       I am not sure what is going on, but if I do not put this marker here, Blogger is leaving a huge blank spot from the top of my blog to the first entry.      Obviously I do not want a blank spot, so I am putting this marker in until it is fixed.    DRAT!  It didn't work.  If you know how to fix this problem, please do tell me.  Thanks!      For your entertainment, I will leave a pleasing photo. It's an image pertaining to Astrology. Personally, I think it's far out. Get it?

         Photo Credit:  urlLink The Food Network      urlLink  THE IRON CHEF    in my opinion, is the best show on   urlLink  The Food Network   . I am not much of a cook, although admittedly, I have been more into it as of late. I can make a few really good dishes. I mostly eat out, I am not one to prepare awesome food for just myself. I'd prefer to do it for a boyfriend, but alas, I currently do not have one. I was looking forward to cooking for C, but when I went to visit him in Los Angeles, he did not have a stove. Sigh. So, I never got the chance to cook for him.  For those of you who do not know what   urlLink  THE IRON CHEF    is, I urge you to watch it immediately. It is so entertaining! The program is a Japanese program, but for the Japanese neophytes, it is dubbed in English and also has subtitles.  Essentially, the program is about four Master "Iron" Chef's (  urlLink  Japanese   ,   urlLink  Italian   ,   urlLink  Chinese   ,   urlLink  French   ) being pitted against a "Challenger". The Challenger picks which Iron Chef they want to do battle with.   urlLink  The Master of Ceremonies (Kaga)    then announces what the secret ingredient is, a.k.a. "allez cuisine!" Both chef's then see what the secret ingredient is when Kaga unveils it, then have one hour to prepare their dishes for judging.  To learn more about the show, please click here:   urlLink  THE IRON CHEF     I absolutely love this show! It is so crazy, especially Kaga. You'll see what I mean when you either click on the links or watch the show.  Tell me what you think.

       urlLink      I had a gent look at  urlLink my convertible  today. He pissed me off. He told me that he would "think about it." In other words, not interested. The reason? The car needs a new fan belt. I did not know this until he pointed out the noise that it makes. I do not know much about cars, but I do know a fan belt is not a huge deal. Not that expensive to fix. It certainly should not be a deal breaker for a used car. Especially one with all the brand new things that it does have on it.      I have owned my convertible for nearly four years and put less than 10,000 miles on it! For a 1991 with ~104K miles on it, that is nearly unheard of. Do a search, you'll see what I mean. Most 1991's have 150,000 miles on them.      He told me that once I get it fixed and "offer a good price" I should be able to sell my car. Oh my gosh, I nearly laughed in his face. I am not a motivated seller, so I will wait till I find the right person who knows what they are getting and can appreciate it.
