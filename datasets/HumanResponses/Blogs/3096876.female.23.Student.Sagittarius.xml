      And I think I'm going to go nuts if this week doesn't end soon!  I got two phone calls this week, and they weren't exactly what I had thought they would be.  Mike called on Tuesday.  Mike!  As I told Ky in a later MSN discussion--the wrong one!!!  OK, not wrong per se, just not the one I expected, and definitely not the one I expected to call  first !  We chatted for a minute or two before he asked if Tom had called yet.  I told him no, he had not called yet, and that left both of us to a moment of reflective silence.  Otherwise, though, the chat was great.  We made loose plans to meet up on Friday night at the Maddy for Ky's last night in the city.    The next night, Wednesday, Ky & Ames & I went to see a couple of the  urlLink Hot Docs -- Calling Nate  and  Being Dorothy --and while I was in the theatre I got a call from the very fine Tom!  He left a message, and it seemed like he thought I wouldn't remember him or something.  I called him back (vei excited!) and we chatted for a bit.  I told him that Mike had called already, told him that we had made loose plans to maybe hook up as a group again.  Ky told me later that she was really proud I was brave enough to be honest with him.  Meh.  We made un-loose, very real plans to do something on Saturday night!  Woot-woot!  In not-so-exciting news, I cancelled the High-Speed Internet I had ordered for Brent's house (but that we had never actually set up) and they told me that I needed to return the modem.  The modem is at his house!  Faak.  After much deliberation, I called him.  It was really, really awkward.  I told him what I needed.  He said he'd bring it by on Friday after work.  OK, sure.  Yeah, not sweating at all.  I don't know if I'm really ready to see him, I sure wasn't the cucumber I should have been when we talked.    It's been kinda weird lately, without Brent. To tell the truth, I'm  mostly  doing ok. The break-up wasn't a surprise, and it wasn't an unreasonable thing for him to suggest. We've had a lot of ups & downs in the last year, and in retrospect it seems like more downs. And it's not even just like we're taking some time. We have actually broken up, we are separated.  A lot of people have been giving me the "if you love something, set it free" line, which sounds kinda like a load of bullshit. I guess it's just that I really miss him, and that whole boyfriend/bestfriend dualism. Double-or-nothing.   I'm planning my life only a couple of weeks in advance now, which is a very  foreign thing, given that Brent & I were planning things years in advance. But  I asked myself the other day if the break-up is still a good idea--would I go  back to Brent today if he called me up? I'm not really sure, and that  hesitation is a pretty good indication that the answer is 'no'. So in classic  cliche break-up style, I'll guess I'll throw my hands up and sigh, "it's all  for the best," and just keep moving on.   Tomorrow never comes until it's too late...

      Ky and Ames and I very nearly went to see  urlLink Super Size Me , although spending a Sunday afternoon waiting in line for a movie about the perils of fast-food consumption when all three of us had a pretty hardcore hangover was no one's idea of a good time.  So instead we went to lunch at McDonald's.  I used the bathroom while there, and it wasn't pretty.  Errgh.  But Saturday night, that was a hoot and a hollar!  The girls and I (after copious amounts of pre-drinking chez Ky & Ames) shuffled down to the Madison for a night out.  The crowd was good, and we sat out on the patio.  In the midst of a conversation, I noticed that our little group was suddenly larger--two boys had joined the fray, and cute ones too!  After chatting with them for sometime, the group became even bigger -- they called their friends at another bar and told them where we were, and suddenly there were five guys to just three girls!  Not a bad ratio!  I was drunk.  There's no sugar coating it.  And I looooooooved the attention I got from these boys.  The most hilarious thing about this whole chance meeting is that these guys were from my hometown!  I got all the way into the Dot, just to meet guys from O-Town, guys who grew up and went to school mere blocks from where I've been my whole life.  Just too freakin' funny.  Anyway, I started off talking to Mike--cute, but young!--and then he forgot my name.  Ooh,  blacklisted ! (right Ky?)  And then I started talking to Tom.  Also very cute, but at least my age.  And we had a ton in common--music, movies, ambition--and he seems to have such a wide variety of talents... I remember saying to him as our whole group stumbled out the Madison on our way to 24/7 breakfast that he was just gonna have to marry me.  And walking along Bloor towards Mel's, didn't he just sneak in the most amazing kiss!  Ooh!  It gave me tingles, and that was just the beginning.    At "breakfast," the whole group of us sat down, laughing and talking like we were long-time friends--me, and Ky and Ames, Jordan, Mike, Mark, Tom, and ... others whose names I never heard...oops.  I only ordered toast, and in fact, Tom ordered it, chasing down the waiter to make sure that he knew what I wanted.  Sooo sweet.  Of course, I sat next to Tom, and I don't remember a thing we talked about but I remember laughing really hard!  I stole a few glances over at Mike, sitting at the end of the table.  Poor blacklisted Mike, just lowered his eyes and shook his head and covered his face, but still gave me a smile.  When it finally came time, at about 4am, after Mark's girlfriend had called four times(!) to say goodbye, Tom gave me a very nice, very passionate kiss, and promised he'd call me.  I don't think I'll hear from Mike, who I had given my number to earlier in the night, before he forgot my name  , but I sure hope I hear from Tom again.  The girls and I decided that we had a great time, hit it off tremendously with these great guys, and all hoped to see them all again.  I stayed for most of this rainy Sunday afternoon at Ky's, and thought about how much I'm going to miss her when she moves out in a week.  I know Amy will still be there, but Ky--she's our glue.  I can't believe what dumb-luck that was to meet up with such awesome female friends in the last few months of my undergrad.  I call that typical.  Faak.

      I went to IKEA the other day.  My work gave me 80 bones of gift certificates to IKEA for Christmas.  I was saving them for something Brent and I could invest in, but...  Yeah, and actually being there was no easier.  Aside from all the standard gay-guys filling the aisles, there was also an abundance of couples milling around (yes, even for a Monday night it was packed at IKEA) and it got me feeling really nostalgic.  These couples are doing the same thing that Brent and I would normally be doing at IKEA: looking at the merchandise, shaping our lives around our furniture.  How Palahniuk.  But depressing... like Palahniuk... hmm.  I got some lamps, some organizational stuff, some pictures frames, and I went home and lit, organized, and decorated my room.  It's nice and bright now, maybe I need some dimmer bulbs, and everything's got its place.  I put half a dozen of my favorite pics into frames... so what if three of them had Brent in them?  Whatev.  Mom was telling me just the other day, there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing, but I need to be careful not to burn myself out.  I can keep busy,  but I need to make sure I'm staying rested too...  yeah, sleep is sooo easy lately.  Ky has convinced me that the best thing for everyone concerned is a night of drunken debauchery this Saturday.  We're going to go to the Madison, traditionally, quite the hotspot for fights (!), of course there's no Brent now to contend with.  We'll see how this goes, and hopefully I can find the impetus to actually write about it afterwards.

      The rain woke me at about 10 this morning. I got out of bed to open my blinds a bit so I could watch the sky from where I lay.  It felt odd for there to be such a violent storm at 10 in the morning.  It felt like the kind of disturbance that should wake you at three or four in the morning and spook the crap out of you.  Yet, it was also oddly comforting.  To know that there was something else that felt like I did.  To know that there was someone else under the same tortured sky that felt like I did.  Even now, when my own emotions have reached the point of numbness, I can feel him, I can feel his hurt.  I can't tell if it's a connection, or if it's an echo of the pain we felt in this room, just last night.  After the storm, during it, probably, I fell asleep until a quarter to four in the afternoon.  I awoke feeling dazed, stunned, beaten.  Feeling like I'd been heavily sedated, then abused.  And then the pain intensified by 1000x when I remembered.  I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.  I didn't get into my PJs last night.  After I watched Brent pull away from my house, I went straight to my room, shut and locked the door behind me.  I just took off my jeans and bra and got into bed.  I could still smell him on my hands and my clothes and I couldn't bear to lose that smell to foreign PJs or a handwashing.  Because it's the nearest thing to him I had left.  My heart heaves a heavy pang: I don't even have a picture of him from the last six months...  In the mirror across from my bed, I can see I've still got puffy eyes and my face is blotchy but pale.  My hair is curled in the places where the tears wet it.  His and mine.  I try only to look at the mirror because it doesn't reflect much other than me, and everywhere else there is just too much of him.  HIs pictures taped to my dresser mirror, other people-less pictures that I took while we were together--Rattlesnake, Hilton Falls, Newfoundland.  The worst is the picture of us at the winter semi-formal.  The worst is the picture of us from our first Valentine's Day.  The worst is the picture of up taped onto the tupperware that holds the sand from our first Sauble trip.    That fucking bitch who gave birth to me didn't waste a moment.  As soon as she heard me out of bed, brushing my teeth and washing my face, she came up after me.  "So." "Mom, if you've come up here to say something abrasive I don't want to hear it." "No, Sweetie.  I didn't come up here to say anything abrasive."   Really?  Then what's that vindictive tone doing in your voice?   "So what happened?  Did you two break up?" "Yes." "On your behest or his?"   Oh great, a triple-word score.  Now I know I'm in for it.  "He decided.  He said that he needs to grow up.  He needs to learn how to be a man.  He needs to stop looking to me to provide reassurance and happiness, he needs to learn how to find it himself." "Well don't bother being sad about it.  You orchestrated this.  You gave him no choice.  You were too much of a chickenshit, you didn't have the guts to say to him 'we need to take a break for six months, maybe a year.'  Oh no, you just forced him to say it first."   Fuck Mom, what do you want from me?  "Fine Mom.  Yeah, it's not unreasonable, and it's not a surprise.  It's just that I'm really going to miss him.  He was right, it was the right choice to make.  And I didn't force him to do it.  He wouldn't have said all that or done that if he hadn't given it a lot of thought."  And I guess that's true.  But is Mom right?  Did I force him to make that decision?  Fuck, what have I done?  I was absolutely overcome with sadness on Saturday night.  On Saturday afternoon, I called Brent at home from work.  When the topic of our plans for Saturday night to "talk" came up, I asked: "Is this going to be a good talk, or a bad talk?"  Silence, terrifying silence.  "OK, I guess it's going to be a bad talk?" "Yeah," he said.  "I don't think it's going to be a very good talk."   Oh, fuck.   And after that, it was just pure dread.  I shaved my legs in the shower.  I half-wondered why, did I really think it was going to come in handy tonight?  I cut myself really badly on my knee.  It bled like a war-wound, even after I got out of the shower.  It bled through the band-aid I put on it.  Brent showed up when I was half-way through drying my hair.  His eyes were wild, his jaw set, and he was chewing his gum like it owed him a hundred bucks.   "Sorry,"  I said.  "I'm just running a bit late." He glared at me.  "It's ok, just keep going."  Then he jumped into the bathroom.  In the reflection I saw him blot his eyes against some Kleenex.  Oh shit.  When he came back into the vanity he was a little more composed, but still noticeably upset.  I dried my hair, then we just stood in the vanity, staring at each other in the glaring hot lights of my Mom's vanity mirror.  The chins wobbled and the tears rolled down both of our cheeks before either of us had really said a word.  My sister barging in suddenly encouraged us to move this tearful stand-off into the privacy of my bedroom.  My very messy bedroom.  And he broke into a fit of crying and sobbing and told me how he had come to this painful decision.  That we need to take an extended break.  That we need to break it off.  He said that he had enjoyed hanging out with his buddies these past weeks, but that the whole time there was this terrible pain in his heart and a nagging curiosity about what I was doing.  He said that he couldn't bear that anymore, that things needed to change, and that we need to take some time apart from each other.  In one of our first conversations after that Sunday I left, he told me that he defined himself in terms of us.  His talk last night reflected that.  He said that every decision he made he made for us, not necessarily for him.  He thought about all the things that he lost out on, the things he didn't get to experience because of choosing us.  Nothing that would make or break someone's life, no, but things that just needed to be experienced in life.  Things that were unfairly missed if it was because of someone else taking up too much of your time.  He thought that if he could just get some distance, he could start figuring out who he is.  Then came the talk about us.  About how I'm the most amazing girl he's ever known, about how he loves me so much, and that this is so painful.  And he was telling the truth.  I know he loves me, but I'm not sure if he truly is making this decision for himself or if it's for me.  He said that he understood how I must have felt when I was considering going overseas to teach English.  The heart-wrenching struggle between choosing something for yourself or choosing something for someone else.  He also said that when I told him, he gave serious thought to taking the money he would have used for his motorcyle and buying a ring instead.  He thought he was going to propose to me.  But he said that that would have been unfair, that it would have unfairly held me here.  It's true, although it breaks my heart now to hear it.  That he would have asked me to marry him, not only because he loved me, but also very much because he wanted to keep me from leaving.  We have talked about marriage so many times, and I never thought of it as something that would trap me.  This makes me really sad.  Every now and then, I get this horrible panicked feeling.  Mostly, I feel numb, but every now and then, this panic sets upon me.  LIke it is right now.  I went for a very long drive with my sister today.  I needed to be with someone who would be okay with just listening to me talk, not telling me that I am the architect of my own misfortune.  And all of my favorite places to drive are between Oakville and Milton.  And I drove right through his neighbourhood, past his street.  I wanted so badly to drive down his street and past his house, but I also thought it would really upset me, and I had to keep it together for Alley.  And what if someone saw me.  I don't want to make this any harder for Brent.  I don't want to turn into a stalker that won't let him live with his decision.  Especially since it was a doozy.  He's going to have to be really sure that this is what he wants before he can be forced to make any new decision.  I sent him an email on Saturday, just after we had the ominous talk on the phone, while I was still at work.  It said that, whatever happened that night and whatever got said, I love him and I will always love him.  I don't know if this will end up hurting him, and I hope it doesn't.  I hope he keeps it and remembers that I do love him.  He kept begging me to forgive him, to not hate him for doing this, the whole time he explained to me his decision and his reasons.  He said that it was him, not me, in the most non-cliche way possible.   Baby, how could I be mad?  You said the words I couldn't say, you made the same kind of decision I would have, and you still love me.   That was something else--while we were trying to console each other, we kept slipping up, calling each other 'baby'.  It hurt everytime, saying it and hearing it.  I wish I could have been with him one last time.  Once we calmed down a bit, we were both so starving that we decided to leave.  After that, the protective magic was gone.  Once we sat down to eat, we got to talking, and talking just felt so comfortable, so natural.  And we started talking like we normally do, and I just couldn't help it.  I broke down, over cheeseburgers and Mcnuggets, I sobbed violently, with the heavy sadness of a condemned soul.  I through away the best thing in my life for what?  I bit of selfish overindulgence.  A relationship with someone that I know will never go anywhere near the altitude Brent and I were at.  In the most cliche way, I have lost the best thing of my life.  And I don't know it I'll ever be able to get it back.  If I tried in the next couple of weeks, maybe we could work something out.  Maybe not, it would probably too embarassing, given what he's undoubtedly told his friends.  But the longer I wait, the less likely it will be.  He said that we're going to stay friends, that we're still going to hang out.  When he left me on Saturday night, he told me he would call.  Soon.  I hope so.  A world without him will be a bleak place.  I need to know what's going on with him, and I want him to know what's going on with me.  Superficial, yet ridiculously heart-breaking: I have no camping trip at Sauble to look forward to.  We were going to go for the entire week, to our favorite place in the world, to sleep out under the stars, on top of pine cones, listening to raccoons having their way with any garbage we might have left out.  I was going to get special self-inflating mattress pads--expensive ones, I figured we had suffered long enough.  Now we're not going to get to go.  I think I may pay off my credit card a bit and book the site anyway.  If we don't end up using it, it's only a $9 cancellation fee.  And I think I'd jump at the chance to go camping with Brent.  A part of me is freaking out right now.  What the fuck am I going to do without Brent???  I mean, holy shit!!!  My boyfriend, my best-friend, my everything--GONE!  And another part of me, a more stoic part, tells me that this will be a great opportunity to get all the evil out of me, and do something really great with myself.  If we're supposed to be together, it will happen.  If not, then we would have fallen apart inevitably.  I want to drive to his house right now.  I still have a key.  I could park my car down the street a bit, creep into his house, get undressed and crawl into bed with him.  Leave with him in the morning, when he goes to work.  I miss his bed, I miss the smell of it and the feel of it--always warm.  And we just fit together so well.  The curves of our sleeping bodies mimic each other, almost literally adhere.  His smell is always so sweet and pleasant, his hands always know where to go.  There's just no one who knows me like he does.  I never need to explain to him, I never need to ask--he always knows.  Oh, what am I doing letting him go?  Fuck, is all that even totally true?  If he knows me so well, why didn't he know I had strayed?  Why didn't he know what was bothering me, why didn't he know how to fix things???  I guess he's not Superman, and maybe he's just human.  Maybe he's just struggling in this crazy world, trying to figure out who he is & where he's going, and do it with someone he loves at his side.  I know, I know for sure, that this pain is just going to be a temporary plague.  That I'm going to see Anil, or just let Brent sort of fade for a bit, and the pain is going to go away.  And I hate it.  Why couldn't I love what I had enough to protect it with my life?  Why couldn't I love him like he loved me?  Why don't I have it in me to make the commitment I thought I could?  Why can't I just act like I love him as much as I actually do???  I hate that I'm like this.  Always, eyes wandering, wondering what else? what next? who now?  All he wanted to do was love me and live happily ever after.  He didn't care before whether he ever went out with a guy friend ever.  All he said he needed was me, was that true?  Was he deceiving himself, and me too?  Has he really been only half-happy all this time, like I have?  I don't believe so.  But, I guess after all this, who am I to know?

      My dear friend Mona sent me these uplifting words of wisdom today...       When you feel that nobody loves you,     Nobody cares for you,     And everyone is ignoring you,     You should start asking yourself...     Am I TOO sexy?

      I  should  be doing laundry, or even catching zzz's, but instead, I'm sitting bolt upright at the damn computer again (!!!), dazzlingly emotional, wondering what the hell I'm doing at the computer again!  (don't blame the machines, it's your fault.)  I know he's still awake.  I'm pretty sure, but he hasn't called.  And I can't figure it out.  I can't figure any of it out.  They made me take a test to see if they could trust me on the roads.  How come "they" don't make me take a test to see if I'm emotionally fit to move about with the other so-called "normals"?  I love being heartbroken, I think that's what it is.  I'm addicted to whatever it is.  Some girls get jealous, because I get a lot of attention from boys, of course, I also give a lot of attention to boys, which doesn't leave a lot of room for girlfriends...  They don't understand that it's just as much torture as fun, that I'm getting my emotions dragged through the dirt, torn, burnt, slashed, etc.  I'm addicted to the heartache.  That's why I couldn't stand to be with Brent anymore, because he just couldn't hurt me like I need to be hurt.  He cares so much, sooo much, and is just generally so kind.  He loves me and would sooner suffer pain on my behalf than ever inflict any on me... or allow anyone else to.  Not me, though.  I'm sick, so I'll suffer pain on my own behalf--fuck, it's all I want.  Bridget called me tonight.  Almost as soon as I heard her voice, there were tears in my eyes.  She sent me this picture today, of her artwork from school -- ha! Pasta art practice drills! She is just so amazingly hilarious.  She can take the joke, totally carry it, then hurl it off into oblivion with her own unique twist.  That girl makes me laugh so hard.  I mean, that women.  I have known her since before I can remember (although that could just be a side-effect from all the pot...?) since I was five.  We shared chickenpox -- actually, we tag-teamed the chickenpox -- swapped paintings as retribution, and just generally best-friended-around, wherever we went, for years and years and years.  After so many years of growing up together, we suddenly started to grow apart.  I guess it just happens, especially when one of them is particularly selfish and lazy...boo me.  And Bridget, damn that girl Bridget, found my goddamn blog!  So now I'm half-self-conscious of what I'm writing, though lord knows it's pointless--she's known me this long, she's not gonna think worse of me  now .  So Bridge, I'm glad you're reading -- if you are (did I just hear something?  what was that?) 'cause it's just another 10-page letter on foolscap, both sides.  My hours spent on the phone were followed by hours more of talk.  Mommy can go on forever!  And so can I.  Sometimes, we have these conversations way into the night, and I wonder if it's really just to see if one can't wait the other out.  Har har, Mommy, I'm on to you.  We had a ... 'heated' debate, I mean, discussion, and now I think she thinks I think she's a racist.  Although, I don't think that.  Not at all, I can recognize that a lot of things are different now than they were in her youth, that people's perceptions, society's norms, have all evolved and changed.  And the thoughts of yesterday gave birth to the thoughts of today, so they're still related, they're just different.  I hate when we fight.  I think this is just premieres symptoms, however.  She's uncomfortable with the Anil-situation, she doesn't want me to just displace B like that, with some guy I've just met.  I was trying to explain Ani to Bridge today.  He's absolutely a conundrum.  He is like the brown Dan Van Zant of DotU: he's wicked-hot, totally self-assured, he's got such a  way   about him, it's just enchanting.  He has been (up until recently) immensely absorbed in winning my affections, or at least he rekindled his fire-drill feelings for me after he  broke up with his Jennie .  (Jeepers I hate that name, just makes me want to be sick all over her pretty, blonde little head.)  Errgh.  He called me constantly for a few weeks--it was phenomenal.  I'd be out at sushi with Ky after RLG any day, and I'd feel my cell phone, set to vibe, in my coat pocket, two or three times through the meal.  And he'd leave messages, everytime sounding like his little heart might break into a million pieces if I didn't call him back.  He begged me to let him take me on one date -- he'd pick me up, bring flowers, take me to a nice restaurant.   (Hmm, so I caved.  Where's my fancy dinner, Ani?)   And he'd tell me what great friends we are, how we'd have such a good time together.  And so, things with B fizzled out... and things with A flared up.  And last week, I'd say that we were really doing great, but this week it feels like something very big has changed, and I'm shut out, so I have no idea what it could be.  I told Ky, I've got a bad feeling about this could be.  He invited me back to his place pretty easily, sure just to "hang out, smoke a joint" but how many other girls might feel perfectly comfortable doing the very same thing, only moments after meeting him, like me?  It's not totally improbable that some little chickadee has distracted him, some "younger model" that he can trade me in for.  Fuck, I think I got played.  I think, actually, that I'm just freakin' out.  I think actually that he's just been a little grumpy, a little realistic, and a little impatient, and that I'm grossly misinterpreting all this.  I think that he knows what I know, that this is nothing that's going to turn into SOMETHING, and that what we're doing is just having fun and killing time.  Time we'd rather not spend alone.  So do I fight him on this?  Do I tell him that he needs to learn how to love me or leave me (so that I can leave him later)?    He called me once while I was at work.  I didn't know until later.  Then he called while I was talking to Bridget.  Yeah, no way I'm gonna tell her to hang-on while I go talk to that dipshit.  Nuh-uh, he's not  that  important.  And I'm feeling all mushy-gushy, talking about him.  I don't know, is he a good guy?  A bad guy?  I think a bit of both.  He's for himself, and I don't fault him for it--I'm like that, too.  Maybe it's like two positives or two negatives, and you can press 'em together as much as you want, but they're just not ever going to stick.  But they may have really kinky sex, in the meantime.    What the fuck...he just came on MSN...

      OK, so I found this while browsing through  urlLink someone else's blog .  They seem to be equally mystified by it as myself.  They found a website that had a picture of the ever-elusive "used panty" vending machines of Japan.    And I'm just not sure how I feel about that.  I'm all for technology, for giving people whatever they're willing to pay for.  I don't think people should be allowed to sue tobacco companies or the like just, because if you pay for it, you consent to whatever goes along with it--people gotta take responsibility for that stuff and stop shirking it.  Back to my point, though, which is I'm not sure if selling supposedly "used" panties, which we are given to understand are little girls' panties, is really conducive to encouraging healthy sexual behavior.  OK, now I'm entering into the modesty debate...  Sex is good, and sex between consenting adults (and I agree that teenagers can easily be considered 'consenting adults') is good.  Domination, well, that's a bit of a grey-area for me.  See, I can handle someone going to someone else, looking to be dominated, but to force someone else into submission, that's not ok.  So I think that pretty much establishes my thoughts on the subject.  I don't think that a vending machine that sells the worn undergarments of children, of young girls, is hocking a responsible commodity.  I mean, who buys that kind of thing?  The answer that springs immediately to my mind is "PERVERTS".  Yeah, child-molesters, rapists, whatever.  Kids and sex should be separate.  In fact, if there is a supplier to sex, that supplier should be consensual.  For example, porn stars know what's going to happen to their image, how it's going to be distributed, etc, so that's ok.  Girl's that get stalked and have weirdos rifling through their trash to feed their sick little fantasies, I think it's pretty safe to say that's NOT ok. Get me?  You picking up what I'm putting down?

      I've figured out bits and pieces, that's it really.  But the baggage, I can't help but lug it around, and it's only fair: he shows up everywhere carrying his too.  Baggage, the stuff left over from other relationships--it weighs us down, it colours our decisions, it interferes with our ability to forge new relationships unmarked by past hurts.  And it's definitely a factor with me and AniRandom.  He just got out of some thing with some chick Jennie.  The impression I've gotten from AniRandom and his friends is that she is a hateful bitch, deserving of zero pity, and played a brutal game with my Ani's heart and head.  Yet...  They broke up over Christmas, and were together for just over a year.  This is the first point.  Ani & I have been chilling together since September, and he never mentioned her.  He said she stayed at his place, like every other night.  I was at his place a couple of times through the week, how is it that I never met her?  Never heard him on the phone with her?  And there was also the crazy couple of weeks when Ani and I first starting feelin' stuff for each other, then when he kissed me, then later when we had sex.  They were together then, and I had no idea until after the sex.  Hmm...  When he finally told me about her, he told me that he already knew she had been cheating on him.  So why are you still together, I wondered?  He's brutally honest about things he's not afraid of, but things like, well matters of the heart, they scare the shit out of him.  Or they must, why else would he be so hesitant to be totally honest with her?  With me?  It concerns me a little.  I mean, they were together a YEAR and he had no qualms bringing me up to the lair.  We've only been seeing each other a couple of weeks--what happens when he starts getting better-than-luke-warm feelings for some other little cutie-pie he's chillin' with?  At any rate, she must have done some pretty nasty stuff to play with his head.  He never met her parents, he said she never invited him to her home.  That's kinda odd.  I was stoked for him to meet my parents, and unfortunately, with the way the timing all worked out, it was just too late by the time he showed up.  But he brought flowers, so that says to me that he wanted to make a good impression.  Ironically, even though he didn't get to meet Ma & Pa, he still made a pretty good impression... on Mommy anyway.  Bubbs doesn't fall for stuff like flowers so easily.  Money also seemed to be a pretty pertinent issue.  Or like it was the source of a lot of ... discomfort.  My AniRandom is a lucky kid--he comes from a stable, affluent family: they provide for him whatever he needs and never question it.  That's great.  My parents did much the same for Ally and I--we've never gone wanting.  Even this year, I'm 23 years old, I've got a decent job, and minimal expenses associated with school now that my last round of tuition is paid for...yet, when I've needed a couple of bucks my parents have totally helped me out.  Granted, they have yet to hook me up with a sweet-ass condo in the heart of downtown in addition to paying tuition, but that's something else.  When we went out to the James Joyce, he paid for the drinks.  When we went out to dinner the next night, I paid.  I wouldn't let him give me money for the cab I had to take from the train station.  In fact, on several occassions he's offered money as the solution to whatever mini-problem popped up, and I've defeated it everytime.    "No, if you aren't going to come to get me, I am NOT taking a cab, I don't care if you're paying."   I'm trying to reinforce my side of the value vs. price debate.  He thinks that everything has a price, and that price is definitive.  But I think that value is flexible, insubstantial, subjective and that this is truly definitive.  I don't care about appearances, insofar as they are monetarily defined.  AniRandom has a really hard time understanding that.  I care about appearances only insofar as they are a manifestation of self-esteem.  Do you care about yourself?  Enough?  Too much?  That's it.  But plenty of things he's said have indicated that he's used to, and not overly comfortable with, paying for everything when he's with a girl.  We had a brief, and sort of awkward conversation about jewellery.  The only piece I've ever worn from a boy was the amolite ring and earrings B gave me for my birthday a couple of years ago.  But otherwise, I don't wear any.  It's just a coincidence really.  But when Ani asked what I would do with jewellery from him, I told him I'd refuse it.  That absolutely flabbergasted him.    "What???  You wouldn't keep it?  Why not?" Because if you know me well enough to be giving me gifts, you'd know what to give me.  And you'd know that it's not jewellery.  A real gift of affection should be just as much proof of how much he cares as well as how much he knows about me.  Money doesn't do anything for me.  He doesn't get it.  I kind of like being so unlike anybody he already knows.  I don't think he's ever dated a little skater-girl like myself.  Although, I think the term he used to describe me was GAP-skater.  I didn't appreciate it.  I've spent a lot of years  ignoring  the GAP, and I'll not have all that boycotting done for nothing.  I don't think he's ever gotten together with a girl who played so hard to get.  Even now, getting together for "dates" is a tricky task.  He's starting to understand that this has a lot more to do with the schedule I already had in place pre-Ani, and less to do with playing games.  I still have my wall up.  He's still hard-pressed to get little gems of Mag-isms.  And of course, there's also his testiment to never dating a girl he was already friends with.  That probably has a lot do with the way things have worked between us.  It feels to me, that he feels very comfortable with me.  There's almost no subject too taboo to discuss, we can get naked, stinky, even go to the bathroom, and nothing seems to unnerve him.  It unnerves me a little!  He's opened up to me, told me some pretty secret-sounding stuff.  I'm not sure what to do with it all.  Sometimes I think he trusts me a little too much, and I can also sense a subtext of dependency there: he really  needs  someone to open up to.    I'm torn between twin desires to fall into his arms and to run far, far away.  I have a very real feeling that he's going to hurt me, and I think he has that feeling too.  Like, this relationship can only get better, and he likes abuse!  He's going to get sick of me living so far away (he's already whined at me on several occassions during late-night phone-calls about how far I live, about how he wishes I was there with him...) he's going to get tired of us not being able to be spontaneous (distance + 2 schedules), and he's going to get horny sometime when I'm not there.  Yow, that sounded really jealous, but I think it's actually realism.  For example, on Saturday night, I went to a movie with B.  He, on the other hand, had a chick he works with over to smoke a joint (I advised that he may want to be careful about giving girls the wrong impression [as he did to me, only a few months ago] as they will get the wrong impression,) then he had his best female friend over (no qualms there, she was around long before me,) and then he had a chick from Montreal over, Liz.  Now I know he Liz go way back, and they're cool and probably totally platonic, but she brought a couple girlfriends with her.  And here's a great indicator of his comfort level with me: he told me the girls asked him to strip (!) , that they went to this mega-posh lounge for drinks (where he spend $100+ on boose for these little sloots!), and then they asked him to come back to his hotel room with them.  Yeah, I wonder why...  OK, but none of that actually makes me nervous.  I think that given his recent experience with Jennie, he's not going to cheat on me (anytime soon) because he knows how crappy it feels.  But eventually he will get comfortable me, and forget the pain, and he will hurt me: he will think about how he hates the distance between us, and he will do something to bring someone else closer, to fill the void.  I guess that's my baggage.  Automatic distrust.  I will refuse to trust him until it is too late, and he is no longer deserving of my trust.  It will be interesting to see how this works out.

      So, my seedy little love-triangle is not working out at all the way I had planned...  Let's do the math.  Ani is not exactly what I thought he was going to be.  And now I'm wondering if it was worth the sacrifices I made?  B is having the time of his life.  We're on speaking terms, and the animosity, or most of it anyway, seems to have faded.  We had a "date" on Saturday, ie: he picked me up, we had dinner, then we went to a movie.  Granted, he spent the night, but it's been five years, and we've been apart two weeks, and we don't need any damn excuse.  (Though, it wasn't make-up sex.  Just really, really good sex.  I don't think we've resolved anything together, though we've made leaps and bounds as individuals.)  He said to me, last night on the phone, "It's been kind of fun for the past couple of weeks, acting like I'm -- no offense -- a single guy.  It used to baffle me when Chris would say he only sees April on weekends, but now I get it."  "Yeah," I agreed.  "It can get to be a little bit much.  Seeing each other everyday is a lot, and it's not bad, but it means that then there's no room for much else."  So he's having a good time.  He said he's hanging out with his friends tonight, a description I found to be wholly non-descript.  I figure it's probably either code-talk for hanging out in "mixed company" or he's trying to make me think that's what's happening.  "Just as long as you're okay with that.  'Cause of course, if you  weren't  ok with it, you really couldn't get mad.   Ahem ."  Yeah, thanks Mommy, always with your words of wisdom.  Damn you...  But no, I wouldn't be upset if he was hanging out with chicks.  Besides, whatever he's doing, he's being very subtle, so that's ok too.  I trust him not to do anything to purposely hurt me.  Accidental hurt, well, that's just a part of life I guess.  So, we're not together, we're not apart...we're just...on a break, I guess.  I can still tell him I love him, we still exchange "baby", and we still talk, almost every day.  I saw him Saturday for our date.  Sunday for a rented movie, then Monday for shopping before I went to Quannum.  And it's good.  Who knows what will happen in the next weeks, who knows what will be said when we actually sit down to talk.  But right now, things are good, and I feel like I can exhale.

      Ok, honestly.  Is it just because it's Easter Weekend?  Every blog popping up today has gone one thing or another to say about Jesus.   I don't know anything about Jebus.   I thank my Catholic high school edumacation for jading me so fiercely as to be absolutely repulsed any time I see any hooray-god bullshite.  There's obviously no point in rambling like this, but it's my right to do so, just like all darn theists.    Here's something though: so many are talking about Jesus and quoting this or that part of the Bible, and yackity yack. Who's been doing any real self-motivated learning in religious studies?  Especially  comparative  religious studies.  Kamenetz wrote a great book, should be on everybody's list:   urlLink The Jew in the Lotus.   The point is not Judaism vs Buddhism, rather a look at pluralism (sans the cultural relativism.)  What's important here is not about how we are different, but about how we are the same in our differences.  It's not about a nihilistic absolute truth, but the plurality of truth s .  When a delegation of Jewish representatives went to see the Dalai Lama, they thought they could go there to teach 'em a thing or two.  What they found when they got there is that they had a lot of learning to do themselves.  We are the same in our humanity, in our suffering, in our ability to be compassionate, in our need to receive compassion from others.  No need to quote that stuff, it's all pretty basic.  It seems that religious holidays bring out the zealot in us all.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all about having a paid day off, (read the previous blog, I spent it drinking and fornicating.)  But it's when people maintain their fundamentalist, literalist leanings that I get a little antsy.  What university taught me, other than how to be a snob, was that there are simply too many people on this planet, heck, there are too many people on a square block in the Dot, to ever stake a claim as if it were infallible.  Pointing to this paragraph or that chapter, or this line or that reference is meaningless.  I'd sooner site truth out of a cookbook.  What the world, and especially Easter weekend, seems to be lacking is honest insight. Too many cling blindly, and falter,while others (like myself) choose not to believe, to withhold that commitment, until something really genuinely inspired comes along.  The Passion is just a movie, the Bible is just a book.  Stories, all fake.  What's real is what we believe, because it guides what we do.  Look not to others for guidance and instruction, but deep within yourself...if you're looking for the truth.  And if all you're looking for is someone to negate your guilt, to reassure you that you're good and loved, and to give your money to...then I guess organized religion is right up your alley.

      Head was very hurty yesterday, luckily I didn't go blind like I thought I would.  So it came and went... my last day of undergrad.  Only 10 messages from Ky, et al, "Hi Mag, where are you?" or "Hi!  Where's Mag?"  And finally I got where I was going... Diso!  I begged and bartered and convinced Ani that it would be in his best interests to journey out to suburbia to pick my ass up.  He called me from the Gardiner whining already about the traffic!  Yeesh, as if there was anything I could do about it except commiserate!  And shock me, shock me, shock me, if that sweet boy didn't waltz up to my door with flowers!!!  Like, when was the last time that a boy brought me flowers???  Beautiful lillies, and I kept thanking him for them and he kept thanking me... for what, I don't know.  He was very disappointed that my parents weren't around (they were in bed, shame,) but at least my doggy was there to greet him.  Yeats actually barked at him when he came in!  (My poor ignorant puppy is a little afraid of people with dark skin...)  But they made friends soon enough.  It was adorable, actually.  Yeats loves tall men, almost as much as I do, and when we left I think Yeats was more sorry to see Ani go than me.  When we finally got to the James Joyce, things were a little shaky at first...  Finding Ky was no easy feat, for starters.  Then there was the matter of shaking off an annoying little hustler who had taken a liking to  several  of the chicks in our group.  ( "Are you Norwegian?" )  He did  not  know how to take a hint.  When he very nearly got into a fight with a group of Ginos (read: greasy hair, shirt collars upturned, very shiny shoes, and  attitude ,) Ani asked me if I thought he should go over and help the guy out, but the female verdict was unanimous: if he got his ass kicked, he probably deserved it.  The ovary-bearers can be cooooold-hearted.  I know it.  And can I say I got D-R-U-N-K!?!  I had a fabulous time hanging out with my girls, and it was made only more fabu by the handsome boy I had hanging out with me.  He was so sweet and affectionate.  And for all the yuppie he is, he fit in perfectly.  He's just one of those guys.  I've gotten the impression from looking at all his pics of his travels that he really is one of those people who can fit in anywhere, he can make anything work for him, he can make friends with anyone.  Ani's just awesome that way.  All the same, I think we may have gotten our first "looks."  There was an older gent in the bar, and he was absolutely intoxicated (either that, or so numbed by years of practice that he just looked like it,) and he kept staring back and forth between Ani and I.  Never said a word to us, just a light sort of smile on his face and these looks at one of us, then the other, and back again.  Whatever the look was, it didn't appear to be at all hostile, but it creeped me out nonetheless.  Ani plays the race-card with me all the time.  I can't tell if it's him or me--I mean, he says he does that because it makes me uncomfortable and he likes getting a rise out of me, but...?  I have to admit, Ani is the first guy I've gotten seriously involved with who was of a noticeably different ethnic background than myself.  (Ani says that Peter, the Polish Prince I dated, doesn't count because he's still white.  Though I argue that Peter's  practiced  culture is a heck of a lot more different from mine than Ani's, but whatever...)  I don't know if I really understand.    After last call, we took off.  We had to take a cab, he would not let me walk "Do I  look  like I belong in this climate???"  He asked me.  (Ahem, Ani, weren't you born considerably further North than I?  Just asking...)  Although, it's true.  He can't take the cold.  His condo is always ridiculously hot, which is fine for mackin' the ladies and gettin' them to shed some layers, but is a little uncomfortable for a casual hang-out temperature.  Ky, who has been an envious sort of supportive about me getting together with Ani ("You bitch!  Hee-hee!  You're gonna have seyex!")  told me as we were leaving that all the girls were stoked about me & Ani.  Yeah, me too.  We got back to his suite, and he almost immediately rolled one up.   As if being drunk off my ass wasn't bad enough, now we're going to throw pot into the mix, too???   It actually had more of a sobering effect than I thought it would.  We looked through all his pics from France, and I got really...um...nostalgic.  OK fine, I got a little teary-deary thinking about how far away some of my favorite people in the world are.  Mark's in France, BJ's in Rome (or is it London?), The Brit's in Amsterdam, and my best friend Bridget is all the way in Oz!  It was just too much, and I actually even let a few tears loose.  I don't think he saw them, which was good, because I didn't want our night to turn into a sobfest.  It came time for bed, I didn't waste any time.  I shed my clothes and scooted under the covers, feeling absolutely more comfortable with him everytime we're together.  Our pillow-talk slowly dropped off, and I thought he'd be dropping off slowly too, but hormones are what they are.  I still can't get over how much I love being with him that way.  He fills me up just right.  And that night there was no hesitation, it was just so pleasant. OK, that's perhaps little more bland than I actually feel--in fact, he friggin' rocked my world.  I breathed hard and moaned softly and raked my fingernails up and down his back, and bucked and squirmed.  And when he whispered in my ear how wet I was and rocked a little harder, a little deeper...I came again.  He kisses me when we make love, my face and my neck and my lips... oh my, it was lovely.  How's that for un-bland?  I don't remember falling asleep on Thursday night (which was actually Friday morning,) but when I awoke at nine a.m., his whole place was full of light and warmth.  It was incredibly reassuring and pleasant.  I want to wake up there again.

       urlLink Macho man has bitten the dust: he's been replaced by something just as tough inside, but softer at the edges. Peter Gotting reports on a new target market.    He loves Armani, is seen just as often near a catwalk as competing in sport, confesses an adulation for Kylie Minogue, even designs his own jewellery. But he's not gay.   So Ian Thorpe told Australia in a radio interview last November. With interests outside the domain of the traditional, Aussie, macho male, Thorpe talked about his sexuality for the first time. He was flattered that the gay community identified with him, he said, but he was, in fact, heterosexual. "You know, I'm a little bit different to what most people would consider being an Australian male," Thorpe told ABC Radio.   But he's not that different, at all. Men of all sexualities are taking a greater interest in their appearance. They go to hairdressers rather than barbers; avoid using soap because it's too harsh on their skin; visit the gym instead of playing sport and even have difficulty deciding what to wear.   They're occupying their time differently - not only spending more of it in front of the mirror, but also at boutiques, in bars rather than pubs, enjoying a dance at a nightclub and going to beauty salons. Cosmetics brands such as Ella Bache say men make up as much as 40 per cent of their salon customers in some areas.   Marketers are spurring on the change, dropping the macho element from products that target men. Gone are the tough male images, even from beer and car ads.   Men's fashion chains are growing, with women's stores such as Esprit launching men's ranges, and department stores offering boutique-style experiences. Men's magazines are increasing their coverage of fashion - not just for editorial reasons, but because they're getting more ads. The men's title FHM says its fashion and grooming advertising has increased 35 per cent over the past three years.   Twenty years ago, male fashion, skin care and vanity in general were identified with gay men. Now sexuality, it seems, is irrelevant. In fact, British newspapers have even found a new word for the softer man: the "metrosexual".  ... As the presence of women increased in men's social and working lives - as their rights were belatedly recognised - men have changed the way they act. Straight men, some marketers believe, are changing because women demand their partners take greater effort with their appearance.  "The feminist movement has been the biggest contributor to the men's market since it has developed," says Jean-Marc Carriol, director of the fashion company Trimex, which represents Clarins in Australia.   As women have pushed for equal rights, Carriol says, "the success of that push has fundamentally altered the way men and women interact within the workplace. Appearance and grooming are really important."   The workplace itself has changed for many men, too. As the proportion of white-collar workers grows, so does the need to look good. To compete in today's work environment, you must dress well, have your hair cut neatly and take care of your body.  "There's a lot of categories that are purchased by males, but using what we would conventionally regard as female cues," says Treadgold. "Traditionally, when purchasing home entertainment systems, we would expect guys to be motivated by gadgetry and technical features. But, increasingly, there's a certain type of male choosing it from what might be seen as female attributes, such as the environment of the store, level of service and other intangible things."  Global research by the advertising agency Euro RSCG last year showed that men were more secure in their masculinity, with those aged 40 and above displaying greater sensitivity, particularly through family values.  "The definition of what it means to be male is changing," says Euro RSCG's strategy planning director, Matt Donovan.

       Picking your nose makes you healthier and happier, Austrian doctor advises    Picking your nose and eating it is one of the best ways to stay healthy, says a  top Austrian doctor. Dr. Friedrich Bischinger, an Innsbruck-based lung  specialist, said people who pick their noses with their fingers were healthy,  happier and probably better in tune with their bodies. He says society should  adopt a new approach to nose-picking and encourage children to take it up, the Ananova Web site reported. "With the finger, you can get to places you just can't reach with a handkerchief, keeping your nose far cleaner," he said. "And eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of strengthening the body's immune system." Children happily pick their noses, yet by the time they have become adults they have stopped under pressure from society that considers the practice disgusting and unclean. His advice? Pick your nose in private.    So, my little cousins were right???

      ...But I can't stop myself! Right now I'm (supposed to be) writing a paper for my anthro class - PopCulture.  It's a neat course, although it was completely lacking in structure, and I need structure real (rei) bad.  So I'm writing a paper where I have to illustrate how a particular piece of advertising is a cultural text.  I used a cosmetic ad from a women's mag.     It's supposed to be ironic: using the image of the atypical 50s housewife, holding a tray of baking, except it ain't cookies, and they ain't for you little rug-rats.  This is mommy make-up and it's just for mommies.  Wait a sec, I don't think this chick has ever had any kids.  In fact I don't think she's ever had any cookies.  But it's appropriate to the modern woman as defined in our culture, because it's funny.  Funny and true.  If it's not cleaning house and cooking meals to keep men happy, it's putting on slooty dresses and slathering on the make-up.  OK, that was a bit snipier than I meant it to be.  And that's why it was important to go see Mattee.  Yes, yes, I went over there to smoke pot, and yes, yes I did smoke pot, and yes, yes I'm rambling on and wasting blog space... But my good friend Mattee is going to be the best damn art director...as soon as he graduates.  And he's gonna go work for  urlLink Leo Burnett , or  urlLink J. Walter Thompson , or  urlLink BBDO , and be even more rich and famous than  urlLink Jerry Goodis  (yeah, for some reason, Mattee didn't know who that guy was when I dropped the name...hmm).  Anyway, Mattee had lots of very good constructive comments.  Not a whole lot of insight as to where I should take the paper, whether in another direction or deeper into the direction I've already embarked on...  But hopefully, I can get this done without too much pain.

      Phew!  I can't believe today is already here.  Today was my last day of class, and it was a weird day.  Of course, it started weirdly.  I was up so late finishing one paper and starting another one.  And there was the time that I  had  to spend on the phone with Ani.  Then another call back to him at three in the morning...  "I am fucking brilliant.  The word is 'compliance'."  Yup, I called him at three a.m. to tell him that I remembered  the word.   Then I was awake at nine.  Ugh.  We're supposed to go out with Ky and Ames and many others for a night of wild drinking (and open-mike night!) at the  urlLink James Joyce .  It should be good.  I'm thinking about asking Ani if he wants to take a trip out the 'burbs to come get me, but I'm not counting on it.  For such a daring urbanite driver, he seems scared shitless of the 'burbs.  That's actually because he's a yuppie.  He thinks O-Town is a hick town.  I keep trying to explain, we've got a large and largely affluent population.  Not a straw-hat among us.  Try telling him that, though.  It's getting so hard to distinguish my  feelings  for him from my lust for him.  Again today, Ani was talking about the end.  Actually, while he was in the shower I saw a note scribbled near his phone, from his last conversation with his pundit.  Get a job, stop eating meat that comes on four legs, and don't commit until 2006-7.  Uh, excuse me?  He's not supposed to commit yet, although, "psychics" are always really more psychologists.  That was probably just some pseudo-parental advice.  But I know he takes stuff from his pundit really seriously.  Hmm...I wonder what that means for us.  I should probably ask him if he's ever talked to his pundit about me, about us.  In the meantime, I'm going to mull over a quote that made Ani laugh pretty hard:  "In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry, and has been widely regarded as a bad idea."           -- Douglas Noel Adams

      And 9:30 means it's time to take my pill.  Fack, Mattee just called, and I just realized, it's been almost three hours that I've been home from school and I've gotten  nothing  done.  Why am I so easily distracted?  Somebody said to me a few days ago that I must be a total third wheel to Mattee and The Angel.  I tag along, and show up for their late night burn sessions, though granted it's often just me and Mattee.  Sometimes The Angel creeps me out a bit.  When I told her about the problems I was going through with B-Dizzy she just sort of smiled, and a few chuckles slipped out.  Hmm, that doesn't seem like the kind of stuff that friends do.  When Mattee cried on my shoulder about The Angel, I didn't laugh.  Although, perhaps that's the point: she doesn't want him, but if there's someone else gunning for him (which I am NOT) then she's gonna make it at least a little hard.  Ani hasn't called, neither has B.  None of my romantic interests are ringing my bell, only my metrosexual Mattee.  Well, if I go for a bun right now, my chances of getting home at a reasonable time (WITH comments for my anthro paper!) are a lot better.  With  urlLink Quannum  approaching (and I got my ticket today!) I've been listening to an excessive amount of hip hop.  Totally neglecting my punk-rawker roots.  But I LOVE Mos Def.  Seriously, much love for Mighty Mos.  And he is just delicious!  Meow!  OK- Time to go bun.  Maybe I'll have some stoned thoughts when I get home and should really write my paper, but actually just waste my time blogging (gaaaah.)

      My exam ended sooner than I though.  Professore is such a great man, too bad his classes are completely lacking in structure, or else maybe I would have had a better time.  C'est la vie.  I went to the 24th floor when I was finished.  Ani told me to just come up, he'd leave the door unlocked, because he was getting in the shower (!!!).  I dawdled, because I wasn't really sure that showing up when he was running around in a towel would be conducive to keeping my distance and my guard up.  Didn't matter, actually.  When I got up there, he was already dressed and smelling like somebody's gooooood time!   My  good time.  It's weird how Ani and I are able to be so comfortable together.  I feel almost embarassed at getting naked in front of him, and yet more embarassed  because  I'm embarassed.  It just feels as if being naked with him is the most natural thing.  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear that.  I don't think I'll give him the satisfaction.  Besides, he already got some.  Afterwards, he challenged me to an in-bed game of chess.  Last week he whooped my ass three times in a row, and don't think he didn't gloat his head off.  Okay, in my own defense, I'm no stellar chess player, but I've never been scared to play a game or two.  But he figured out how to get check-mate in four moves (bastard) so he killed me right off the bat in the first game.  In the second game, I was just really stoned and making some bad decisions.  By the third game I was less stoned, but feeling totally defeated and just let the game get away from me.  But today, well sir, today was quite a different story.  I didn't just beat him at chess, I beat him at his own game!  He thought he had me on the run, and I just came out of nowhere with all sorts of threatening pieces and strategies.  It was awesome, almost as good as the sex!  And he was such a poor loser!  He was absolutely confounded--how could he possibly lose to someone he's beaten three times???  He wanted to play again, but that was it, I was tapped.  Even though he still couldn't believe his loss, Ani still made me dinner.  And for a single guy, with barely anything in the fridge, it was actually pretty good.  He's a cheese-man, as in, he dresses up every meal with cheese.  Or at least that's the impression he gave me.  Sometimes, that hot, hairy bastard really confuses me.  Like, he offered to drive me home tonight, and I told him that he should stay at home and get work done.  He pressed, and I said ok.  "And I get to stay over, right?"  He asked.  Excuse me?  Stay over, is that what you said?  It sucks, I can't tell my parents about him, because I don't know what's going on with B, and what if things aren't really over?  He and I are really such a good match, but getting into something like this right now is a bad idea.   (If it's such a bad idea, how come I'm already doing it?  Good question...)   And while he seemed rather distant once I told him he couldn't stay over (what did he really expect???) he told me to call him when I got home.  Instead, he called me.  So I called him back, and had just started chatting when...  Perfect segway:  when I got home tonight, I saw that B had called, at almost 8:30.  So I called him back, but left a message on the machine.  "Hi, I saw you called.  Just wanted to call and say hi, see what was up.  I guess you can call me anytime you want."  When I asked Mommy about it, she told me that he called to make sure I wasn't home, then dropped by.  What???  Oh, so that Daddy could sign his FAC thing.  Yeah guns.  But he called me back maybe 20 minutes later.  We talked, and it was weird, disconnected. Like talking to an old friend who's little more than just that.  I'm beginning to think that things are really over between me and B.  I'm still not sure how I feel about that.  THAT is why getting into this with Ani is such a bad idea right now.  When things have been going so poorly with B, and things are going so well with Ani (who is still getting used to me, getting used to the idea of being with me,) it's hard to really figure out the truth of who I'm better suited to be with.  I just can't see B yet, and I can't let go of Ani yet.  Totally eating my cake.  I'm disgusting.  Though I'm sure Ani would understand if he knew the truth, there's no way he'd be  happy  with the knowledge that things between B and I aren't as over as I said they were.  And after about 20 minutes of awkward silences and harsh truths, (for example, that B gathered up all my stuff and is holding it in a laundry basket in his room--including the book of mine he borrowed but hasn't finished reading yet,) I decided that we were teetering dangerously close to the brink of our issues, and I just don't have the strength tonight (luckily I'm ok to blog.)  But after we hung up, he called back only a moment later, sounding sniffly, and said "I still love you."  "Oh, sweetie, I didn't know if you'd want to hear me say that, but yeah, I love you too.  Goodnight."  And he hung up.  It's hard pulling away from one that you love.  I just don't understand where we're supposed to go.  I mean, B knows me, like he  knows  me in a way that no one else possibly could.  I guess because I've never been with somebody for five years.  But Ani seems so perfectly suited to the kind of boyfriend I need right now.  He seems more in tune with my needs, but only my right-now needs.  I dunno.  It's the culture difference that, right now, stands out as a barrier to any hopes of something more serious, more long-term with Ani.  I don't know if his Indian parents will like a non-practicing white girl to marry their son, so that we can have mixed-ethnicity babies.  I don't think my parents would have a problem, and I don't know for sure that his would, but he's said on more than one occassion that his parents are really traditional.  B's parents I already know I have a problem with, but at least there wouldn't be anything overt they could ever point to as problematic if we marry.  Although, I can think of a few things...  I need to think, I need to act.  B won't wait forever for me to make up my mind, and Ani's going to get really hurt if I let him get close and then tell him I'm going back to B.  Why can't I just be with no one?  Because I'm afraid to be alone, because I'm totally boy-crazy, because I don't know if I could do without sex and I wouldn't want to have any sort of one-nighters.  Eww,no.   "Bob, does it get any easier?"  "No."

      I'm sitting in the Pratt library, killing time.  I've got 32 minutes to go until my final in Pop Culture, and I'm bored.  All I need to do is just get through this one hour of class, then it's one more thing I can cross off the list.  I'm exhausted.  This time change has killed me.  At least it's beautiful and sunny.  Cold though.  So cold I had to put my three-in-one back together today.  Sheesh.  Two weeks ago I took the liner out, last week I switched to a spring jacket.  And now, I'm back to full winter coat.  Although, at least I have enough pockets to carry everything--train ticket and pass, subway tokens, cell, mp3 player, shades.  Spring jackets just aren't bulky enough to lend themselves to utilitarianism.  Ugh.  I just have to get through this class, then refine my article critique, start and finish my anthro paper, then write another exam on Wednesday and  FINI !  I met one of Ky's profs today - Steven Scharper.  Where the heck was this guy for the last four years I've been at UofT?  I wish I had taken a course of his.  At least he recommended a good book:  urlLink Red Blood, by Robert Hunter .  I can't wait to read it.  I have so many books to read this summer.  Books I would have loved to read while I was still in school, but there's not much to be done about that now.  Ky thinks Effective Writing will be too easy for me, but I need a first semester half-course to balance out the second semester half-course I want to take: Achieving goals through words.  It's a semiotics course.  Looks really good.  I've got to remember to take a look at those post-grad courses at Humber that caught my eye...

      How fatalistic.  So much has changed recently though.  B was just saying to me the other day that things have changed and now will never be the same.  My philosophical side countered that, theoretically, things are constantly changing, we just adapt so seemlessly that we don't notice, so really it's not when things change that it's bad--it's when things don't.  He didn't buy it.  I spent HOURS on the phone with Ani tonight.  He's doing his best to figure me out, but I know I've got him thinking hard about what he's doing after me at all.  I am playing  HARD  to get in the most hardcore way.   I  understand the reasons why, and to me it's absolutely reasonable, but I can't explain those reasons to him.  He keeps saying that the novelty is going to wear off, that I'll get tired of him and drop him like a bad habit.  And Ani's always telling me that he's going to be so heartbroken when I leave him in 6 or 7 months.  He can already see the end, yet he's still pushing on to be with me.  He absolutely boggles me.  Although, my studies of interpretive Buddhism for my RLG exam showed me an article where the author said that people endure the longing because of the pleasure that comes when their cravings are satisfied--conventional ways of pursuing happiness produce sorrow instead.  I don't think he's sorrowful, but he must be relying on the evidence of his senses.  We joke about the mile-high wall around me, but he's talked about it several times without a trace of humour in his voice.  He keeps saying that he just wants to get inside me, inside my head, get to know who I really am.  He's right, I keep up my guard almost constantly.  Probably because I've got no business getting into a relationship with someone else now.  He said something tonight that boggled me--he told me that I'm probably going to leave him for B, or at least go back to B after we break up, and that I'll probably end up marrying B.  Is it so obvious?  That's cruel, though.  I don't mean that, or at least I don't know well enough to say yet.  It's very dangerous, my time with Ani, he's a really great guy--absolutely, genuinely kind, he's sensitive and emotional and intelligent.  He wholloped me at chess the other night, three times in a row.  Schooled me, the bastard.  Yet, I never wanted him so badly as I did after losing like that.  He just does that to me, get's my juices all going.  Back in October, when I first really understood my attraction for him, I remember getting light-headed--like a giddy little freakin' school-girl--when we'd hang out.  When our fingertips would touch as we passed a joint, or evening just sitting next to each other on the couch, his hands grabbing for my feet constantly so he could crack my toes.  And that fateful comment.  Sitting out on the observation deck of his building, he commented on how short I am, and I told him that's why I've got to have a tall man.  Oh yeah? he said.  And dark and handsome, too?  Iy!  I took that one to bed with me a lot of nights.  Actually, that was maybe more of a teeth-brushing fantasy.  Bedtime ones were like the afternoon that was our most unusual.  After our regular scheduled program of joint, OJ, a bit of TV and a lot of gab, he left the room, then the apartment really suddenly.  He was gone for a while, so I stretched out onto the couch across where both of us had just been sitting (still warm!) and started to drift off.  Then I opened my eyes, I'm sure only a moment later, and he was standing over me with a cute little grin on his face.  He bent down over me and said, totally straight-faced, "what would you do if I kissed you right now?"  The answer, we found, was kiss back.    There's really not much that beats rolling around with that boy.  His stubbly beard gets a little prickly sometimes, but his skin is so soft and warm and smells like something of summer, his hands so comforting yet unnerving.  Yow.  I wanna do bad things with him!  Real bad!  So I'm having my cake and eating it too.  Gut rot is minimal, so I'm doing good.  I'm gonna go up to 24 tomorrow.  Ky got all giddy on Friday night, dancing around "Yer gonna go have seeyyyyex!"  She's happy for me, and maybe even a little jealous, although she's got quite the boastful entourage herself.  This summer is going to be the most extraordinary summer I've had in all my years at U of T, 'cause of course it's going to be my first summer actually  in  the Dot.  My fantasies say that some days, after work, I'll go for a swim, have a shower, then pack up some stuff and head down to Ani's.  We can go for dinner, drink some wine, hop in the jacuzzi when it gets a dark...  And of course, endless activities that we can do in the boudoir.  I'll get up the next morning and head to class, and then, we'll have the rest of the day for fun in the sun, etc.  It's going to be the most unusual, and hopefully one of the best summers, I've ever had.  It's a really nutso-smasho battle of emotions going on inside me.  On one hand, there's B.  The old, long-time boyfriend.  He's changing, and I'm finding it hard to read him lately, but that can only be expected.  I love him infinitely, but there's something there that's just not right.  I shouldn't feel so trapped.  One Sunday,  the  Sunday, I remember waking up at five in the morning with him just draped over me, and I pushed him off grunting "I need some space."  Although nothing has been quite so disconcerting as the dream I had last summer that he was really my son, and that's why I love him so much.  That it's not a passionate love, but the unconditional love of a mother.  Freaky-deeky.  On the other hand,there's Ani.  He's sweet and very persistent, and I really appreciate his honesty and realism, especially about me and us and our situation.  But I'm not sure that I'm really starting things off on such a footing that our relationship, or whatever you wanna call it, will bloom into something really meaningful.  So do I stick with what I know and lose the chance at something new, or do I risk everything I've built up thus far and go for it with Ani?  I suppose in the next few posts, I'll start hashing that out...

      I reflect now on the irony that what I want, more than anything, is to be happy.  Yet, Buddha says that to be happy, I must forget the wanting.  So instead of happy, I am forgetful.  And Mommy says it's because I'm a pothead.  How unenlightened!

      It's not enough for me to just sit down and start writing.  I gotta ease into it--for the sake of myself and any unfortunate readers that just might happen to stumble here.  There's me,  Margaret Bones .  The star of the show.  I'm a full-time student, on the brink of having nothing to do with a lot of her time--I think it's called "graduation".  I've always been a creative, self-reliant kind of person, that's just who Mom and Dad made me.  I've got a healthy ego (who knows  who loves me  the most-- me  or  'the boys' ?  Toss up.)  I try really hard to lay on the angst 'cause it makes the words flow easier, but it's not really me.  My highschool writing was affected by that lilt, but since entering university and pretty much giving up on any writing not 100% academic, my skills have waned and degraded into a cynical sort of musing.  My thick sarcasm acts like a speech impediment, and it mostly makes me really difficult to understand.  I'm the often optimistic, idealistic, romantic and terribly typical bleeding-heart liberal.  I majored in anthro, picked up history and religion minors.  Suffice it to say, I'm going to be terribly unemployable, but I had a blast at school.   B-Dizzy  is my sometimes boyfriend, but forever love.  That will make more sense when the plot contextualizes it, so more on that part later.  I've known B since I was 15, and we were together from the time I was 18, just before we finished highschool.  Best-friends, hands down.  There's nobody that knows me better, even if we're not getting along so well as of late...  Even when we aren't getting along, he knows how to touch me like nobody knows--there's no awkward searching, he knows where and when to touch, and how and when to kiss.  He knows the stories that turn me on, and the cuddling positions that put me to sleep afterward.  We have some very unfortunate fundamental differences, and I can't explain how much of a surprise it came that there were some differences that I just couldn't deal with forever.  Big surprise to us both, I suppose.   Alley , my kid sister,is the light of my world!  She's the biggest bitch I've ever known, yet somehow anytime I'm mad at her, she convinces me with her jokes and her big brown eyes that really I'm the one who should be apologizing.  She is my go-to for late-night chat or sessions.  We missed a lot of good years because we were fighting so much, but we're great friends now, so at least we're on the right track.  She's a smart, witty cookie, and I'm really surprised that she didn't beat me to the blog.  Maybe she'll make a blog for her poetry and I can put a link here?  (Eh, Alley? what do you say???)   Mattee  is my always loyal friend and pothead.  Bunna bunna.  Perfectly platonic and remarkably metrosexual, Matt is by far one of my favorite people in the world.  Somebody (ahem!) pointed out to me recently that we're probably the most perfect match for each other.  And that's pretty true: just the right mix of intro/extrovert, he's artistic and well-spoken, absolutely hilarious, and still completely down to earth.  Hmm, well.  If only he could get the Angel to see that.  She is the 2nd reason why nothing would ever happen between me and Mattee.  The first reason is because then I'd have to see him naked, and I don't know if I wanna see that pasty ass.  (It's probably hairy too--much love Mattee!)   The Angel  is blonde and beautiful and ridiculously aloof.  I feel complete and utter pity for every boy that crosses her path, Mattee especially.  None of them seem to leave with their heart in tact.  I wonder if she ever notices?  Come to think of it, I think I'd feel pity for anyone in her cross-hairs.  She's a sweet one, but vicious!  Yow!  Kyla, also Stin Ky , my best friend, laughs at everything.  In fact, she has a laugh for everything.  She's got this perfect, comical way of parodying everyone--I shudder to think how she 'does' me.  Her wicked sense of humour mixes with her soft & lovely girliness in a way that makes it hard to break eye-contact and even harder to walk away.  Her roommate  Amy  is quickly earning her place as one of the coolest chicks I've ever met.  She's the funkiest, punkiest vegi-vixen I know.   HLFMatt .  That's Hero, Lover, Friend (thanks Ky) Matt.  He's the childhood love that's just never gone away.  He lives around the corner and down the street, yet we've never smoked a freakin' joint together.  That's gotta change, although it's not my fault...  He is perhaps the most creatively romantic guy I know.  Back in the day, he wrote me songs, stories and poems, drew me pictures, played his guitar, and just generally was the most awesome boyfriend.  Too bad he didn't read the part of his Life Manual that said that teenage girls only like boyfriends who are shitheads.  Ah well, he'll find some girl that doesn't want to be mistreated  someday .  There's also British Matt.   The Brit  was a most haughty fling, and perhaps one of the best partners I've ever had.  The sexy thoughts of him just won't fade away.  He's my international man of...something.  He's a terribly arrogant, pig-headed neo-conservatist asshole, but he's also brilliant and a fucking tiger in bed.  Shame that he's on the other side of the world.  The 24th floor is where I find more than just a typical yuppie condo-dweller.   Ani  is the dark chocolate temptation with the hairy chest that I can't resist.  I'm with him and it's all about pleasure.  This man is sumptuous, he touches me and I melt.  It's fabulous.  He makes me feel fabulous, treasured, worshipped, and mostly he makes me forget about everything that's way down below.  Why do I resist so hard?  I don't know.  My parents are a couple of pretty cool folks.  Daddy,  Bubba  when I was but a wee babe, is an awesome role-model, the picture-perfect in-control, take-charge guy.  No sweat for Bubbs.  He keeps trying to prove that he can still go out and party-hearty, as if we might think otherwise.  The first rule of Guitar Club is you don't talk about Guitar Club.  The second rule of Guitar Club, if this is your first night, you have to play!   Mommy  is my best-friend, my worst enemy.  That's the thing with moms, I guess, especially if you're a female too.  Mom's always know what buttons to push, and there's no one that can elicit an emotional response the way a mother can.  Damn her.  But she's the best.  She sent me a length email a couple of weeks ago--I had been having a rough time, and was spending a lot of time away from home.  She emailed me at work one day and said that I didn't have to avoid them if there was just something I wanted to avoid talking about--she and Daddy just want to make sure I'm happy and okay.  Awww.  Mom and I have the regular battle of wills, but mostly we get along in a way that makes a lot of people envious.  Some of these people in my life are from the 'burbs, others are from the Dot.  But they're all my life, and they make it interesting.  Worth writing home about, you might say.  Now I think what we need is a story...

      There are some people in life that we are just meant for.  Yuck, that sounded way more mushy-gushy than I really wanted it to.  You gotta agree, there are just some people who, when put in the same room with them, you'll just be friends, you won't be able to help it.  And of those people that you just get along with, there are going to be some who will understand you and what you're saying no matter what curves you throw, no matter how much you resist or hide.  My curly-haired QueenMo is one of those.  We've been friends for...what?  Four years?  Maybe a little less, I think Shelley's "push" took some time.  But, whatev--it's still a long time.  My Queen (ella es muy linda, thanks SPA100) throws me curves allll the time, and that's what we're all about.  In person, it's all laughs, and then the writing gets more serious.  It's like living a double-life, instead it's having a double-friendship.  Though we're only one person each, we're two people to each other, depending on the context, the medium, etc.  With that in mind, and reaffirming the absolute truth that this blog is of course a record of one's most personal tid-bits, shared in the most public of forums ( the internet, eh?  I hear they have that on computers now... ) I would like to use this opportunity to share a dialogue between us.  I am amazed (and I think in total agreement with something QueenMo said a few emails ago) about how frank and honest she (and I) can be in written form.  Sometimes saying something outloud makes it just too real, and when it's hidden in this code of letters and words, well, it just doesn't seem so soul-bearing.  Or it does, but it doesn't leave that vulnerable aftertaste.  As much.  But getting back to the original point, it amazes me just how eloquently she is able to present her 'confessions' because there are some things that I have seen in my life that I would never want to think about again, muchless discuss, muchless put into writing.  She is afraid that I find her to be distant or cold.  I have never found that this is a quality that she possesses, and it's kind of breath-taking that she might think that about herself.  QueenMo, you might disagree--maybe you have ample reason to believe that you've acted this way with me before, but I haven't noticed.  And perhaps I haven't noticed because I am often the same way.  And perhaps that is one of the many reasons why you and I relate so well.  We share so many of the same mannerisms, however you possess a great deal more honesty and perspective than do I.  My blog has been 100% a confessional.  It's better than when I was a practicing (pretending) Catholic.  When Bridget discovered it, it all came crashing down (she's my best-friend, I've known her since we were 5, and we've been through some serious shit together...but still...)  I felt like I had been revealed prematurely, and I started censoring what I was writing.  And then, I figured, fuck it.  This is who I am, and anyone who knows me will hear the censor, and will be able to read between the lines.  Then I'll just be half a person, however "protected" I feel.  So with that in mind, QueenMo opened her blog from day1, and she's been cute and funny, but also deeply personal.  Like in emails to me, which are so often light-hearted and lift my spirits, she can also be so succinctly honest and thoughtful that it's sometimes a little disarming.   "The important thing is this: to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become."  - Charles Du Bos  I usually END my emails with this quote, but it has given me a ridiculous amount of insight and motivation that I think it works perfectly right here.  She has said to me in several communications that she feels like she needs someone/thing to love unconditionally with all her heart.  Perhaps she needs to turn that caring light on herself???  What's needed here is a change.  And a big change too.  You need to not just think about quitting this job, you need to actually do it.  I have found that the best jobs are never, never advertised--the idea, of course, is that those who are most qualified will know to come looking, the employer doesn't need to spend an ounce of energy seeking out new employees.  Heck, when I got my current job, it sure as fuck wasn't advertised.  I just applied, and I got it.  In a couple of weeks, my aunt is taking me to the publishing trade fair that I think I may have mentioned earlier in my blog.  She said it should only take me about 3 hours to look around the place and figure out what these people are like and who I wanna work for.  Any job that I get will never be advertised, it will be a case of me putting myself out there and hoping that a few prospective employers deem me a good fit for their company.  Don't flip through the paper or check on the internet for jobs.  As we know, the internet is an almost entirely useless plethora of information.  Lots of crap.  You need to find a company that you wanna work for, and apply.  Not even for a particular job, but apply to them with your mindset, your goals, your ambition, and see if it's a fit.  It sounds like she thinks she wants a baby.  Now that I've got that in black & white, it seems a little silly.  But it's understandable.  When a million women around you that you respect and admire and love are starting to be familially inclined, it's totally natural for a woman to think it might be what she wants too.  But as we know, some people are just not like everybody else.  Mo, you're something a little more different, a little more SPECIAL, and you can't just take the same path that everybody else does.  Personalities like ours should never use living things as means to ends -- we tend to abuse them.  Which is not to say "harm", but we can exploit the unconditional love that a dependent being gives us, and take it for granted.  Maybe that's just me.  OK, definitely that's me, but are you picking up what I'm putting down?  Speaking just for myself, what I need more than anything is to learn to appreciate what I have.  Isn't that just the meaning of life, but in all seriousness, I have a really easy time of taking things for granted, because I'm just handed far too much.  I need to suffer.  I need to move out of my house, stop having Mom & Dad driving me around, cooking and cleaning for me, and all the rest.  I need to come home to an empty apartment and feel really, really lonely, because that's when I'll come to fully understand the importance of surrounding oneself with love-people (as in, reciprocation.)  As for the agony of mirrorizing yourself (yup, I just made up that word, I think...)  I do it too.  It's brutal to try and figure out what it is other people see when they look at you.  I have felt my entire life like I've never been taken seriously, and yes, you know what I mean.  People think that because I'm cute I couldn't possibly have any idea of how the world works, or any idea in my head at all.  Some people think they need to protect me, others think they can exploit me.  I'm sure there are lots of people who know me and don't think anything like this, but they are a few and far between.  There's nothing intrinsically evil in that, but I'm not a friggin' puppy.  You picking it up?  So, my question to you is this: is my understanding of my identity in other people's eyes correct?    Intimacy is a crazy, fucked-up thing.  As we know, sex and intimacy are two totally different things, and they CAN go together, but this is not always necessarily the case.  I have a lot of sex, but my more "intimate" relationships are rare; there aren't that many people that have seen me naked on the outside AND the inside.  Because the inside, for some unknown reason, is much more closely guarded.  The body is perishable, impermanent, temporal; the soul is ethereal, transcendent, evanescent.  The biggest difference, and the primary motivating factor for having sex is just for the sake of the physicality, just to be reminded to enjoy the part of you that will one day be no more.  I do it because it's fun, sure, but also because it lets me forget about the samsaric abyss that we are swimming in.  But the effects are short-lived, like cocaine, and soon enough I need more.  Or else I need less.  Perfect segue into my choice of celibacy...  This line was intense, which is why I'm going to restate it here, "when i'm nervous or fearful - i am stone.  i'm  riveted by emotional displays of any kind though.  most of me seems to still be hovering above my body watching, crying and waiting for it all to end."  Holy crap.  I can't help but see myself in that illustration.  Anil complained that I was over-sensitive, that it was likely an echo of the break-up with Brent.  What he totally doesn't understand is that the "sensitivity" he thinks he was getting was a farce.  He's not close enough, he doesn't know jack-shit about me, and yeah, I'll fuck him (damn, that sounded crass,) but I'm sure as hell not going to explain shit to him that he couldn't possibly understand (which is not a fault per se, but just the nature of his personality being conflictual with mine.)  Some of my best-friends still have no idea that I'm going in for surgery on Monday.  Why haven't I told them?  Because I just don't want to get emotional, it's so draining.  How's that for a positive attitude?  Faak.  It's terrifying to feel alone, and it's totally human to be terrified.  But it's also like being afraid of the dark.  We are afraid of what we don't know, what we can't control, of things that can affect us that are outside of our sphere of influence.  But it's irrational to be afraid of such things, because there are way scarier things within our sphere of influence that we CAN control, but don't because we are paralyzed by that irrational fear.  Being alone won't kill any of us (not in the figurative sense, at any rate) and being rejected won't either (perhaps being Ejected from a moving car, but that's neither here nor there...)  It hurts but it doesn't kill, and it's one of those things that's mostly out of one's hands anyway.  Shit, it sounds like I'm calling you irrational, but believe me, I'm not.  We are all irrational creatures, so really, that just makes you and me part of the club.  I'm not sure what else to tell ya.  I think I'm all philosophed out.  Burp.

      Fully realizing that my last post was not the most cheerful, I don't want anyone thinking like it's all gloom and doom in my neighbourhood, because there are actually a lot of pretty good things going on right now.  Let's back it up a bit.  My long-weekend at Sauble.  Well, it didn't really happen.  Which is not to say that Ally and I didn't still make the trip...  I felt a little bad, I had been nagging at Ally all day on Friday to make sure that she had enough laundry done and was all packed up and ready to go at 9am.  She thought I was being bitchy, but of course there's always method.  Anyone who knows me knows what terrible habits I have with being on time, but Ally is about 10x worse!  Tell her one time, be prepared to wait three hours.  See? Waaay worse than me.  But to my intense surprise, she was ready to go at about quarter to 10 that morning.  Good for you, Ally!  We got on the road with our breakfast (Timmy's for me, McDeath's for Ally.)  We were both a little, or a lot, concerned with the amount of fog and rain as we drove up Trafalgar and then Hwy 6, but kept on keeping on.  When we were just 20 mins outside of Sauble, I called to my Aunt & Uncle's house to get my cousin's cell phone number.  Except my cousin, Nick, was the one who answered the phone.  "Hey Nick, what are you doing?"  Trying to make it more than a little obvious how surprised I was that he was at home. "Nothing, what are you doing?"  He asked me. "Yeah, uh, I'm about 20 minutes outside of Sauble."  Silence.  "You remember, you invited us to come camping." "Yeah," that's all he said. "OK, so what's the deal?  Are you camping or not?" "Oh," he says, as if surprised by the question.  "Well, I've got some friends that came up from Toronto, so we can drive up there in a little while and check out what's going on, but I don't think we're gonna stay."  Fuck, kiddo.  Like you couldn't have called me on Saturday and told me not to make the drive???  For Pete's sake!  He met us at Sauble, we ended up going back to my Aunt's place, where she coerced us to stay under threat of death (or at least some physical harm.)  But the best part of the weekend was sandwiched inbetween all that.  Ally and I parked at the beach, and went out for a little stroll.  We spend almost an hour just walking up and down the beach.  Periodically the sun came out, and it actually got warm enough that we took off our jackets.  Heck, there were people swimming!  But that's just nuts--they were definitely out-of-towners.  It had rained the whole weekend, so the beach was full of these little lakes and streams where the water was draining back into the lake.  I guess the waves must have been going a little nuts while it was storming, because the shore was just covered with all sorts of tiny little shells, some the size of my pinky-fingernail, others the size of my thunbnail.  And it was just awesome hanging out on a beach with my sister, chatting, laughing, picking up shells.  If only the weather had been a little nicer... we might've stayed on our own, sans-cousins.  When I was at the end of my teen-age years, and Ally was still just at the beginning, we fought like crazy, over everything.  There was almost never a pleasant word shared between us, and most communication went through my parents.  That's no way to live.  It got to be so that weeks might pass (after one especially vicious fight, almost a MONTH passed) that we didn't speak, and avoided each other at all costs.  Now I see how foolish that was.  I don't entirely understand what happened to make us to animostic, but we wasted years that we could have been friends.  Years passed, no exaggeration, that Ally and I really knew nothing about each other.  Two summers ago, we had a fight (the especially brutal fight I already mentioned) and I'm not joking about how bad it was.  We had the fisticuffs out.  Pushing, shoving, punching, all bad stuff.  And screaming at each other (what about, I do not recall...) and we spent a month or more not even acknowledging the other person's existence.  I think of that incident now with the heaviest ache in my chest--what permanent damage did that cause?  After that incident, after the anger and the ego went away, I remember going to her.  It happened late one night.  She was hanging out in the basement.  "That was a bad fight.  I don't want to fight like that anymore.  Deal?"  And that was it.  Sure, we've had our little spats, obviously those won't go away completely as we are a couple of young-adult females living under the same roof.  But never anything as extreme as that summer afternoon.  Slowly, we've grown to be friends.  Very cautious friends at first, but increasingly relaxed.  Ally and I talk about so much now.  I can't say everything, cause there are some things that we just want to keep to ourselves, and some things that we just don't trust each other with yet (as horrible as it is to admit that.)  But for the most part, we are very good friends indeed.  I'm so glad that this has happened, and I know Mom is glad too.  How many times did she say to us "You two are the only sisters you've got.  So be friends, 'cause when your father and I are gone, the two of you will be the only family you'll have."  And sans-threat, it's true.  She is my family, the only family I've got, save for my parents, and we should be friends, dammit.  A couple of weeks ago, I was sharing with her my want to get a place in the Dot.  She said she was gonna live at home as long as she could, a wise idea and not totally unfamiliar (I will be 24 at the end of this year, and love having my meals prep'd for me.)  But we both got giddy when I talked about how cool it would be for her to come and stay with me if I got a place.  And it would be damn cool.  My sister is the greatest friend I've ever had, and I've only just started to get to know her.  She's a lot more like me than I've ever realized, and big-little sister dichotomy aside, I emulate her more than I admit, too.  But now, it's time to go and do something else.  Pretty soon, Ally will call, and I'll be playing chauffeur to her for the next few hours.  Little brat!

      It's like going into space, but no where near as adventurous.  Hopefully it won't be as life-endangering either.  Aiy yi yi.  I was diagnosed with a condition called high-grade cervical dysplasia a few months ago.  An abnormal result came back with my last PAP test in December.  I found out the day that Brent was rushed to the ER from work with kidney stones.  I believe that it got pushed to the back-burner for a long time.  But now, here it is, live and in color for me to deal with (read: freak out about.)  Now this isn't to say that any of my readers should freak out, oh no.  This is just me being insane.  Because truly I have nothing to worry about.  My doctor is capable, even if his receptionist is a biatch.  The procedure will be brief, and then all I need to look forward to is a couple of years of regular (yeah, every three months!) pelvic exams.  So yeah, I am kind of freaking out about this surgery.  I guess because it seemed so far away until this week.  I honestly haven't given it very much thought at all.  All week long, it keeps popping into my head, and I get these horrible anxious pangs of fear in my chest that make me a little dizzy.  I'll be fine, I'm sure, I just want to get it all over with.  I've just got these horrible psycho-somatic pains now.  When I had to delay my appt a few weeks ago, the receptionist said "you can't keep doing this, you know.  You don't want to get sick."  Can you tell that the words of that stupid ninny of a woman have stuck with me?  Like what the fuck do you know, lady, that I don't???  Errgh.  I feel like my body has betrayed me. I feel like I've been invaded by some foreign entity that's got some vendetta to wage against me. I have nightmares of watching my uterus being eaten whole by a merciless army of ants.  What's the worst case scenario?  A friend asked me this the other day, when I just sorta sprung the news on him ( Oh, by the way, if I seem a little weird next week, don't worry, it's just that I've had surgery on one of my most important parts.  Aha. )  Worst case: infertility, proneness to cancer later in life.  You know, no biggie.  I think he was really hoping to hear that there would be no major reprecussions so that he could reassure me.  When that avenue failed, he just gave me an "Oh,"  Yup, it really is as sucky as it sounds.  Now I'm just being dramatic.  How's this for being dramatic?  I've decided that celibacy will be my best course of action for the next couple of... months?  I'm not sure how long.  At least until I've recovered (I am notorious for never giving myself enough time to recover from anything,) and after that, if it still seems like a viable option, who knows.  It will certainly filter out who's for real and who's not, insofar as the b/f's-in-waiting (as my parents love to call them) will need to figure out what the heck it is they think I can offer.  And of course, the rest of that is a matter for another blog, methinks...

      This is all I've got time for right now.   "If everything is under control, you are going too slow."  - Mario Andretti  Definitely, I am not moving too slowly.  OK, so it's...what?  May 25?  Yeah, regular semester ended April 7.  Mom and Dad have already started in on the "so when are you moving out?" bullshite.  I really don't want to deal with this right now.  I'm finishing out at least the summer at my current job.  After that, everything is still up in the air.  Maybe I'll work through September, make some serious cash, then go for a little trip.  Maybe I'll start a new job in September (one that won't force this Hons. B.A. to stuff friggin' envelopes.  Yikes, that sounded snobby.  I recalled with "fondness" the last time my boss called me into her office.  She said she had a special project for me, because she felt that they hadn't tapped into the full resource of my creativity.  Yup, she had me design invitations for a stupid motivational exercise, then "carry it out" by bitching at people for not participating.  Faak.  Yeah, I really felt creatively exhausted after that.  Yowsa, now that just sounded snarky.  I guess I just feel useless right now.  I want to feel like I have purpose, like I have challenges to look forward to.  And I guess I do, and I guess maybe part of the challenge is figuring shit like that out on my own.  I guess I just hate being insulted like that.  Is this a project for my creativity, or a make-busy project?  So fear not Mona, you will not need to  force  me to quit or get me fired, I'm sure I will do so all on my own.  I issue this challenge to you, however: if YOU are still working there in a year, (heck, after Christmas?) I'm gonna find a way to get you fired.  Yeah, that sounds just about right.  Had to go to the hospital for a pre-op appt today.  At the bus-station coming home I bumped into a kid I went to highschool with.  He looked just the same as ever, talked. acted just the same.  It was an interesting introspective moment that followed (aren't they all?) because I wondered,  am I the same too?   I'll try to commit to a more detailed post when I get home today, lots of stuff to talk about -- a date, my trip, what I've been doing all day, etc.  You know, what ev.

       "If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people."  - Virgina Woolf  Maybe not even "about" other people, but about yourself "to" other people.  At least I don't feel so damn exposed anymore.  It's honesty, it's the real me.  And hopefully, one day, I'll be able to use this self-mutilation to generate some bling.  Er, uh, income.

      My job sucks.  OK, fine, anybody can say that and mean it, but my job really sucks.  I do Customer Service for a telecommunications company, and the result is that I get yelled at, bitched at, whined at (and a number of other annoying adjectives) for eight hours a day.  But every now and then, I get to talk to someone really interesting.  Someone who's easy to talk to or just easy to listen to, and some people just pour their heart out.  Zigmund is one of those people.  He called in to see about buying service from my company, but he was out of the area we cover.  So he's called back every couple of months for the last couple of years.  Always to check on service availability, and very often just to chat.  We've talked about all sorts of things.  I've told him about my love for camping, he knows about Brent, (and now knows that Brent is no more,) he knows that I'm a student.  He was thrilled to hear that I finished my undergrad, and he had no idea that I minored in religion.  He was sorry to hear that Brent & I broke up, but encouraged me that there are other fish in the sea, and I don't need to rush into anything.  He encouraged me to travel, to go back to school, and to go to BC (he is passionate about his province, a land where mountains, forests and the ocean all come together.)  But I also learned something new about him.  He told me that about 15 years ago, he decided to become a yogi.  He broke up with his girlfriend Fatima and committed himself to celibacy.    "I bet you didn't know I was a guru," he says to me.  No, Zigmund, I did not know that.  Definitely not.  He told me about this guy down in Utah, Wiley Brooks.  He's a  Breatharian .  He's not just vegetarian, not just vegan.  All he drinks is rosehip tea and all he eats is the wind.  Crazy, huh?  All this guy eats is air, so I guess you could say that actually he eats nothing.  'Cause that's what air is, a whole lot of nothing.  How has this guu survived?  I dunno.  I read that Chuang-Tzu, one of the founders of Taoism, lived much this way: eating nothing, yet still living a long healthy life.  Zigmund says that a few years ago he trained himself to fast for 52 days straight.  He said that before you can do that you have to eliminate a lot from your diet, subsist just on fruits and veggies for many months, then cut it down to just fruit, then to just water, then to nothing.  Mind over matter, eh?  Anil just started yoga class.  I think I need something for my soul too, the question is--what?  Anil was telling me about deep breathing exercises...I should really try something like that, it's pretty non-commital, obviously low-impact.  I think I remember seeing an infomercial when I was just a wee lass about how we don't breathe as deeply or as often as we need to, and that with just four easy payments of $29.95 you can get a book and instructional video that will show you how to breathe and when.  I think I should be able to coordinate something like that on my own.  Sort of a like a non-dietary breatharian, hmm...

      So how glorious was Sunday?  OK, I guess if you weren't in or around the GTA yesterday, you wouldn't know, so for any out-of-towners, it was gorgeous, just freakin' gorgeous. Saturday, Anil and I had plans to see a movie, I had no idea whether that was still on, since I hadn't really  heard from him since Wednesday.  So I called him and the stupid grumpy-ass boy jerked me around for a bit.  "Fine, whatever.  I can make other plans," Ahh, reverse-psychology.  Did  it work on this stupid boy?  Yes.  Of course it did.  He was at my house within an hour, clean-shaven, bearing roses and hearty-handshakes for my parents.  What a trip.  We went for dinner, it was a not bad meal.  Considering that we had a mini-spat before the night even started, our moods were high and the conversation was great.  He even let me drive his car home, which was super-fun bookin' along on the Gardiner.  But Sunday, that was the day I really cherished.  Anil had to work on Sunday morning, and he was up and about by 9am, so I was too.  Instead of going back to bed as I perhaps should have, I got up.  I tooled around his apartment for a little while after he left, just trying to figure out what to do.  He left me his keys so I could come and go as I liked, and I was damn hungry so I figured breakfast was in order.  Since becoming friends with Ky & Ames, I have learned of the glory of places that serve all-day breakfast.  It's usually pretty cheap, really tasty, and it's just plain nice to have breakfast at any time of day.  I decided once I got dressed that I should take a little stroll down to Hart House on campus and feast on $5 breakfast.  It was such a beautiful day, and walking through downtown at 11am on a Sunday morning, with the sun shining, and Queens' Park full of all sorts of people milling about and doing whatever it is they do there.  The breakfast was... not bad.  The potatoes were a little dry, but they're always the crappiest part of the meal.  Hart House was surprisingly empty--there were probably only 30 people there.  And a wedding party, which I found endless humour in--flouncy dresses like a blue meringue.  Absolutely fabu!  After breakfast I walked back through the Park and sat on a bench around the horse-statue.  Every year, my college, St. Mike's, defaces that statue in its Frosh Week activities.  In fact, it's usually a race between St Mikes and Victoria college to see who can deface it first.  Many is the year that powder blue balloons have been attached to the horses' underside (St. Mikes' Double-Blue!  Hoikety-choike!)   An aside: at the Opera House on Friday, a guy came up to me with the dumbest joke... "Do you know what the difference is between beer nuts and deer nuts?  Beer nuts you find for about $2.50, but deer nuts are under a buck."  Wawka wawka wawka!   I spent a couple of hours just basking in the warm sun and reading my book.  Once I finished it, I went back to Ani's, smoked a huge fattie, and watched The Beach.  Ahh, Leo...  Later when Anil got back from work, we feasted on some chicken Pad Thai, one of my favorite dishes.  Sunday night when I got home, Mona and I went to the drive-in to see Troy.  Not a bad flick, and there is  plenty  of Brad-hiney to see.  Man, that guy spends practically the whole movie with his beautiful bronze buttocks exposed.  Definitely worth the ticket-price!  Uncharacteristically, Mona and I did not in fact talk through the entire movie as we so often do.  Granted, I was just pooped by the time I picked her up, and she was pretty tired too ("I'm old, Margaret," she kept insisting.  Yeah, whatev!)  It was an epic movie, and by epic I mean LOOOOOOONG, but I'm sure Mr Pitt will be getting some nods for it.  To tell the truth, though, it really left no lasting impression on me.  Maybe that was the joint we smoked (Eh, Moaner?   Marijuana affects the memory ...)  If this is what the rest of the summer is going to be like... bring it on!

       As soon as Ames & I hopped out of our taxi in front of the Opera House @ Queen & Broadview, the jump in time was undeniable.  Both of us are originally from satellite communities of the Dot, and have been to the tradtional "coffee houses" and "battles of the bands" when the highschool-aged bands we went to see were kids we went to highschool with.  But standing there, both of us now 19+(++++) it tickled us both to think that no fake I.D. was required.  I kinda wish it were...  But of course, these are different times.  These are times unlike the teenage years when friends' parents were introduced as Mr and Mrs.  Now they're Ken and Marilyn, and I get kisses on the cheek and big familiar hugs and invitations to be a weekend surrogate daughter.  There's another difference, one that I'm a little reluctant to admit to...  This scene, this indie-rock, coffee house, battle of the bands scene... well, it just isn't my scene anymore.  No more do I have any desire to stand around in a smoky club listening to so-so rock-n-roll until 1 in the morning.  By 11:30 I was giving Amy "the look": whenever you want to bust a move on outta here, I'm ready to go.    All of the above does not mean I didn't have a good time... I was just pooped by the end of the night.  But I had an awesome time.  It was great seeing Ky again--it's been since our last exam, a couple of weeks ago--and I've really missed her.  It was really weird driving into the city, parking at the school parking-lot I usually use, and walking up to their apartment building.  The buzzer box still has Ky's name on there (J-Lo has been added yet) but the difference once I got inside the apartment was phenomenal.  It's not Ky & Ames' place anymore...now it's Ames and Jeff's.   I don't like it.   Jeff's a nice guy, sure, but he's a guy!  No walking around half-naked (ok fine, it's not as if we did that excessively before, but at least it wouldn't have been inappropriate had the need arisen), no peeling girly laughter at all hours... it's just not the same.  And, he's junked up the place with all sorts of typical guy crap, like signs that say "24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case.  Coincidence?"  What a jerk-off.  Ok, maybe some of this hostility is a little misdirected, I just hate that Ky's gone now.  As we were both equally drunk (which is to say, not very) and equally bored, Ames & I stuck by each other most of the night.  Ky was the blizted social butterfly, making friends and solving problems all night long, so Ames & I were left to our own devices for a lot of the time.  At one point, Ky went to grab us another round of beers, and when she came back she found Amy & I deep in a catty conversation (!) and she pulled Ames into a hug, I dog-piled on top--"I love you guys!"  And when we all pulled away, there were the fattest tears streaming down Ky's face.  Awww... "Don't be sad, Ky!"   "I'm not sad, I'm happy.  I'm so glad we're all friends, and I miss you guys so much!"  OK ladies, time out.  Let's go to the bathroom and blot some of these tears and come back and finish our beers.  My class starts next week.  I told Ames to be prepared, I'm gonna be calling her a lot!  I've gotta remember that she works at Koffler now, and not Woody's, 'cause I can go swing by there for some coffee & conversation.  Not to mention all-day breakfast at Hart House, sushi at New Gen, and I'm sure the occassional brew or two at a local establishment.  It's really such a shame to have met such great chicks that I became such fast friends with right at the end of university.  I partially blame that on the relationship.  Granted, breaking up with B sooner wouldn't have caused me to meet these chicks any sooner, but I might have forged and maintained more and better friendships had I not always been rushing back home.  Ah, what's the use in being theoretical anyway?  The friends I've got are great ones, I'm grateful for them everyday.  And you guys know who you are... (you blog voyeurs!)

      And I know this because I have a sun tan, and I was sweating while I got it.  None of this fake 'n' bake business.  Nope, I got the real thing, cancer-causing UV rays et al!  It was a fabulous day...30degree weather, beautiful clear sunny sky all day.  I sat in the backyard with a great book,  Straw Dogs  by John Gray, sucked back a couple of beers, and listened to some chill tunes on the ol' mp3 player!  I couldn't have wished for a more perfect day.  I love summertime, and I love going to the beach.  The two, of course, go hand in hand.  In breaking up with Brent, I get to kiss goodbye my yearly camping trip at  urlLink Sauble Beach  (which is ok, 'cause I'm sure Montreal will be full of new memories!) Sauble is perhaps my most favorite place in the world.            I was so glad to hear from Mom that my cousins were going to spending May 24 weekend at their property at Sauble, and eeeeeeverybody's invited.  Yahoo!  I was explaining this to one of my friends.  He thought it was really cool, having family with a cottage at a cool place like that.  "No,  property .  As in, just a lot: no power hook-up, no running water.  Just some grass and some trees."  I'm concerned for Ally--will she be able to "rough it"?  I know  I  can pee outside, but I'm not sure about her!  Another thing about summer and the beach: surfer movies!  And surfer music!  I just started listening to a ton of  urlLink Dick Dale  and I totally dig the tunes!  Totally!    ... I had a little mini-adventure today.  Funny story.  Mattee called me from the Dot, fresh from a killer interview at Ogilvy & Mather and his recent win at the IHAVEANIDEA ads contest, asking if I wanted to join him in a celebratory doobie when he got back.  Sure!  Catch was, I had to pick his ass up from the O-Town GO.  No prob!  Wait... prob.  I got to the station at the appointed time, but there was no train and no Mattee!  Only an announcement that trains were being delayed because of a chemical fire in Clarkson...yikes!  I called Mattee, he said that they're being held up at Port Credit, and won't I please, please, pretty please come and pick up his sorry ass?  Yeah, OK, fine.  As I sit at the side of the road waiting for Mattee to find me (no point in looking for him, he looks just like the 1000s of other marooned commuters waiting for rides) and he saunters up to my car, a 40-something looking man in a suit in tow. "I made a friend," he emphatically tells me.  WTF???  Did he seriously pick up some random guy at the train station? "Hi, I'm Paul," the man says, leaning into my car and offering a hand. I'm sure Mattee could see the puzzled look on my face, and bailed me out without much further ado. "Paul is Steph's dad."  Ohhh, thanks Mattee.   Who the fuck is Steph?   Well, whatever.  Paul left me 10bucks as I dropped him off, as thanks for coming out to get them.   Well actually Paul, I came to get Mattee.  Mattee, where the fuck is your "cab-fare"?  Ohhh, a PRD, huh?  That's ok then.   Whatev, but that was some wicked karma, Paul!  Paid for the dinner I missed 'cause I was driving all over hell's half-acre (I don't know why, but I really love that phrase.)

      Am I 17 again, or what???  I'm going to a... hold your breath ... Battle of the Bands ...at the Opera House!!!  Omigod!  Yup, 17 again.    My very, very good friend Ky gave me the 411 about this particular B of the B.  Her bro, Kaleb, is in this awesome band called  urlLink Storm Without Cease  and they are playing at this show.  For 15 bones, you know I'll be there cheering my little heart out!    Let's here it for reliving your teens...in your 20's!  (Gah!)

      With my one and only exam on Wednesday, one would think I would have had a pretty stress-free week. Nope, not the case.  I was frrrreaked out about this lunch meeting with my Aunt.  But it went ok, well, anyway, here's the story...  She picked me up from Anil's and we went to  urlLink Bistro 990  for lunch, which of course was fabulous.  "If you're going to be getting into the business, you've gotta know where the hotspots are," she tells me.  Apparently the Top of the Hyatt is also a big pub-house hotspot, but that's not where I was, so I don't care about that.   urlLink Gary Busey  was seated at the table next to us, my Aunt swore she overheard some book-talk going on.  She said that the story is, years ago, some publisher brought Mordecai Richler to the Bistro and after that it's been the place to go to sign all the sure-things.  I took this as a good, scratch that,  great  omen.  Would you like to play something called "tickle and pee." ("I tickle you and if you pee you win a set of luggage, a chocolate bunny and some Halloween lips.")  Aunt Colleen was clear: she couldn't necessarily offer me a job, but she could dress me up and take me out whorin' to all the publishing houses in the GTA, she'd take me to trade show orgies, and my business cards would be as popular as herpes.  Oh yeah: the pay is apparently terrible for the first couple of years.  Just terrible!  I think I'd make more at my current job...?  Maybe a liiiittle bit more.  Goddam I'm gonna starve.  The lunch itself, like the food, was also outstanding.  I'm gonna marry the dessert... or maybe the chef?  Had a couple glasses of wine, too, and good stuff--none of this "Growers" nonsense!  And left that place feeling a little buzzed.    Later, Anil picked me up (somewhat reluctantly???) with some chick friend of his -- she was pretty and nice, and was overall just pretty nice -- and we went to some place in Yorkville for lunch.  I just had wine.  Then we walked all the fuck over, and when we got back to his place I was friggin exhausted.  I passed out on the couch, woke up in bed and it was dark.  I had to work the next morning, so I told him I had to go.  Originally, the plan was that I was gonna leave after my lunch, but he promised to drive me home if I stayed until later.  But all of a sudden he was being a huuuuge biatch, telling me he wasn't going to let me leave.  So I started packing up, figuring he'd snap out of it, and he just sulked.  It was 10, so I knew if I took the train I wasn't even going to get back to the station until 11:30, forget how the heck was I gonna get from the train station to home with nary a dollar in my wallet.  But that was it, he was bent on being a bitch, so I didn't wait too long.    It was a long wait at the station.  It's always a long wait at the station, and the train was full of creepies.  The train is always full of creepies, especially late at night.  I managed to get a cab--pure luck.  Getting closer to home, I asked the cabbie to take me to a bank machine near my house; the fare was already $11, so I was like, fuck this, I'll walk.  But I only walked 10 feet and the cabbie offered to take me the rest of the way no charge.  I wish good karma on that guy.  Anil left me a message "apologizing" and it made me gag.  It was forced, contrived, it was like he called one of his friends and they told him what to say.  Fuck, I don't get him.  We get along great on the phone, but one-on-one there's just something missing.  I dunno.  It's like he craves the wanting and not the object, and of course he's just used to getting what he wants.  Asshole...meh.  Really, if he's the "rebound guy", which he is, this really is only temporary.  I'm starting to wonder just how much longer I'm really gonna tolerate this bullshit.  And I complained about Brent!  Yikes!  My sister never talks about Jeff anymore.  Never.  It must kill her to have that part of her life so separate from the rest of the family.  She doesn't tell us when she's hanging out with him, he doesn't call the house, yet they still hang out constantly!  Mom and I had a terrible talk the other day.  She doesn't believe that two people who were at one time very serious about each other can ever be friends after the break-up.  She thinks it's just a tease.  I disagree.  I saw Brent last week when he just "showed up" at the mall (how friggin' coincidental, especially since he called my house first,) and we had a pretty casual chat.  It was a little weird at first, and he slipped and called me "baby".  I won't say it didn't hurt a little.  And then he left, abruptly, to go and meet up with his friends.  "But you can call my cell anytime" he tells me.  Yeah, Mr. Social Freakin' Butterfly.  WTF?  I guess the bottom-line is that we're both alive and well.  He got into school, he's getting a place, and hopefully he'll still be getting his bike this summer.  Hopefully his parents won't find out about that part, and ruin it for him.  In a lot of ways (some that I feel really guilty about) I'm almost glad that we've split up and I don't have to deal with his parent's shit anymore.  I mean, fuck, I have to deal with enough shit from my own parents, and then his too?!  My parents never caused any shit for him, at least none that he didn't deserve.  Seeing Brent last week made me miss him so much.  I really want to call him, or show up, or even just send him a text so he knows I'm thinking about him.  But none of that's a good idea.  He doesn't need to know, just like I don't need to know what he's thinking about, because it would not be conducive to maintaining the very amicable silence that we've cultivated.  Yes, very amicable.  Well, I'll have to get in touch with him sooner or later to see about getting back some of that camping equipment.

      Monday and Tuesday I spent studying for my final on Wednesday, but I did manage to take some time out on Monday evening for a mini-date.  After not meeting up at the Maddy on Friday, Mike and I had tentative plans for coffee on Sunday.  But Sunday I was recovering, and really just wanted to spend some time at home, by myself.  So we said Monday.  He picked me up promptly in a big red Ram pick-up, with a bag of hockey equipment in the back.  What a guy!    Such a guy's guy.  Gotta be careful with those ones, they tend to pick their guys over their girls.  We went to the Green Bean for a spot o' java, and had some good, though slightly awkward conversation.  Given how...  physical  I got with Tom the other night (luckily I had the presence of mind to not give IT iup to him, ) I'm not sure how this is going to work when I'm dating two guys that are friends.  So I gotta keep it as platonic as possible until I make a decision.  Or if not platonic, at least as PG-13 as possible (coarse language, some nudity...hmm, the possibilities...)  As he dropped me off we made plans for Thursday night.  And I was a little giddy about that!  Eeeee!  So we'll see how that goes.  Tuesday morning I talked to Tom and we made plans to do something on Saturday.  Ky thinks it's gonna be "seyex" but I don't know about that!  The only thing I don't like about Tom is that now that it's Tuesday and we've talked, I can't expect to hear from him again until Saturday.  That's just the way it's been.  But I'm sure I can count on hearing from Mike half a dozen times between now and our next date...  Something else that I am waaaay giddy for is a very special "lunch meeting" I've got set up on Wednesday after my exam.  Around Christmas time, my Aunt Colleen sent me an email saying that if there was anything she could do about helping me network once I graduated to just say the word.  So last week I sent her an email.  "Maybe you can help me with introductions to people in YOUR field.  I'm really more interested in getting into something to do with books.  That should be no surprise, I've wanted to be a writer since... since... I was old enough to write, I think!  I'm really looking for a career that will require (or at least expose me to) a little creativity than the average office job. If you had any idea of anyone that might be willing to take a chance on a  student... I'm intelligent, hard-working, and cute as a button (ok, maybe that  won't sell in the corporate world.)  But I'd be really interested in ANYTHING  you might be able to hook me up with."  And Colleen replied to me, very excited, that she'd be thrilled to meet with me and discuss options.  So I have a date with destiny on Wednesday May 5, at 1 o'clock.  Duhn-duh-duh-dunh!

      Friday night we went back to the Maddy, (me, Ky, Ames) and kind of reluctantly.  The crowd was not as good, and as we were walking there, Mike called and said that his friends weren't interested in going into the Dot again afterall.  Boo... but still ok.  I had waaaay too much to drink, even though I swore moderation to myself.  C'est la vie.  And Anil showed up near the end of the night, bought us tequila shooters, and it wasn't long after that I was sick, sick, sick as a dog!  Ralph!  But not too sick to go out on my big date with Tom (Delong, as Ky calls him.)  I called him Saturday afternoon... "So what do you want do to?"  He asks me. "Uh... Whatever it ends up being, it'll have to be a gentle kind of night.  I had a rough night of drinkin' last night, and I'm feeling kinda like ass."  Scoring a laugh is always a good sign.  He told me he had had a similar night on Friday, so also wanted to do something laid back. "How about we grab a bite to eat, then maybe watch a flick?" "Sounds really good, Tom!"  Really good.  Brent called me at work on Friday afternoon.  He had plans to meet some people and just didn't want to wait around, so he said he'd drop the box off on Saturday.  Of course, when Saturday came, I was not at home.  In fact, far from it: after Anil showed up at our table at the Maddy, a tray of tequila in hand, I ended up crashing (and puking) at his house on Saturday afternoon.  I actually called Brent from there to say that I wouldn't be at home, so maybe I could come by his place and pick it up myself sometime?  No, he said, he'd rather just drop it off.  Hmm, ok, well I'd try to be back home in time, but if not... well whatev.  When I finally got home at about 7, Mom said that Brent had been by at about 5.  He left some stuff.  I asked how he was, did he look ok?  did he ask about me?  what did they talk about?  But she gave me nothing!  Said that it was none of my business...?  Uh, what?  It sorta hit me with a nasty little pang that he had been that close,  in my house , and I didn't get to see him.  Mom was like: "He has a cellphone all of a sudden. What's up with that?" Jeez Mom, he's going out on his own, with friends I dunno, meeting people and probably wanting to keep in touch with them. He's not dating me anymore, so he's got time for, like, a jillion other people. Whadja expect, Ma? Every now and then, I get these little pangs of panic... but I keep asking myself, if he showed up right now, saying he wanted to get back together, would I??? Nope, I wouldn't. So I guess that should really allay all my panic.   Hmm... enough of this.  On to the date.  Date went very, very, VERY well! Hmm... is that maybe a little over-eager?  Tom took me out to the Rude Native (a fairly nice restaurant, rei good eats.)  Conversation was great!  Hardly a moment of silence between us.  We talked so much, the waiter had to come back twice to take our orders!  Hee hee!  He knows so much about so many different things, and I gotta say that I really enjoy the company of someone who knows how to hold up their side of a conversation.    After dinner we went back to his place to smoke a joint and watch a flick. Ok, this guy: well-read (vei), knows a ton about movies and music, he's a [reformed--ha!] skater boy, has pierced nipples, and looks just  fantastic  with his shirt off! (yeah, yeah, yeah--what a sloot, I know.) And unlike a lot my picks lately, he's actually older than me, albeit only by a few months.   We watched Amelie... or at least, we started watching it, but we certainly didn't finish.  About an hour into it, he did the ol' yawn-and-stretch move, and had me cuddled against him.  Two seconds later we were makin' out!  Yowsa!  I still cannot believe how attracted I am to this guy.  He is a phenomenal kisser, and we seem to have such chemistry!  Still, I'm being only cautiously optimistic, but I'm still on high-alert. He's sooo by-the-book, that it's both comforting and disconcerting--it's nice when a guy already knows what to do, but a little unnerving when I realize it's probably 'cause he's got plenty of practice under his belt.  I mean, what am I to this guy?  Then again, what is he to me?

      I've gotten some sad, sad news this week. Perhaps some of the saddest news I've ever gotten that didn't affect me directly. A man that I work with, a fantastic guy by the name of Steve, left the office at lunch on Monday and didn't come back. Not surprisingly, questions about the meaning of life are rampant.   Always the last to hear about anything, Mo was at least thoughtful enough to call looking for me yesterday. She told Mom, who had to tell me this morning. Is that a way to start a day? No, but was there also a better way for Monday to go? Probably, so who am I to bitch.   I will always remember him as a guy with a ton of jokes to tell, and the sense of humour to pull off even the crappy jokes. Always leaving me Scooby-Doo sound-bites on my voicemail, or sending me funny emails. Steve was the joker that had a heart of pure gold. So pure, it would make your own melt. He hasn't been like his regular self in the last few months. A grey sort of veil settled over him and never lifted. I thought to myself a few weeks ago that for as lovely as our spring-cum-summer weather has been, he sure didn't look rosy.   What gets me the most is the issue of perspective. He was sad. That's not Steve. Mo told me that his wife said he was worried about people at work not liking him, or getting in trouble for not working hard enough. That's not Steve either. Everybody loves this man--it's impossible not to. There's not a single person I can think of that is more considerate, more mindful of others, more willing to lay themselves in front of a speeding train to help even the most vague of acquaintances. And yet, he thought that we didn't love him.   It forces me to wonder just how much was going on that he kept totally hidden from us, the people that he's worked with day in, day out for who-knows how many years. What kind of sadness causes one to seek out the ultimate solution? And what kind of shame causes one to hide their pain from those who would only want to help?   He left on Monday at lunch. His desk is still just as he left it. Papers neatly stacked here, his phone neatly tidied away there. He left knowing what was going to happen. Mo thinks he was probably planning it for some time. And that's the kind of thing that always irks the people left behind. The unending, unanswerable questions:  " How could we have missed this? "  " Why didn't we know?"    The answers were locked up inside Steve all along, and now will be his to keep forever.

      When I first told Brent about my intention to go overseas after graduation, and it did not go well, I asked myself: why do I want to do this? Do I want to get away? From what--my home, my family, my friends, my boyfriend??? Yeah, a change of location should give me new perspective. Instead, I've found that the old addage is more true: " The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes ." (Marcel Proust)   Do I have new eyes, or perspective, now? You bet. My life is more different, and yet more the same, than it ever was. I spend five years with someone, accepting all along that he would be the person I'd be with always. Then that changed. Heck, I spent most of highschool believing that I'd stay in university forever (and while that's technically true now, I kinda thought I'd have a couple of pieces of paper to show for it. C'est la vie, no?) Now that's changed.   I still want to settle-down, insofar as it involves one day getting married, having kids, and plenty of debt to show for it. I just don't think that's going to happen with Brent anymore. Not unless we "meet" again.   He stopped by on Monday afternoon. The last time I saw him, three weeks before when I had had my surgery, he seemed positive, upbeat, and with plenty to look forward to. This past Monday he was depressed, bitchy, and looking for answers in the wrong places. He came to me because he wanted me to reach out to him, I think. I think he really wanted to find comfort where he used to, and I also think that he left feeling worse than when he came, knowing that I just can't do that anymore.   I'm sure it sounds cold-hearted, and who knows, maybe I'll end up editing this out later, but... I think about all the shit he just laid on me, and then I think about how relieved I am that it's not my burden anymore. When we were together, we carried each other. There's nothing wrong with that, because that's what love is all about--carrying the one you love when they're too tired to walk. But it started to  feel  like a burden. It started to feel like it was always something, like there was never any rest between one of his troubles and the next. And by continually relying on me for support, he was never really dealing with it on his own.  I took a personality test at work, and did my best to take it with a grain of salt, but one aspect of the analysis has really stuck with me: that I have a need, that I am just predisposed to wanting, and inevitably having, an influence over other people.  It almost sounds like that made us too perfect a fit: someone who wanted guidance, and someone who wanted to guide.    But in fact, it has been counter-productive.  In these years, the years after childhood, on the cusp of adulthood, the last of the formative years, we are supposed to learn some of the most important lessons that will then carry us into full adulthood.    I think I prevented Brent from fully realizing these lessons because I worked so hard to think for him.  Ask me anything, I'll tell you how to run his life!  What a fuckin' ego, I've got!  Of course, I can't run my own life with 100% success.  Even 80%...?  Hmmm...  With Mike, he's just such a different guy.  Not only is he much further on his life than Brent was when we got together, he's also much more sure of himself and has a greater support network.  Parents really do so much for us, even as grown children.  They provide support, challenges, and even need.  Brent just didn't get that from his parents who, ultimately, are the most self-centered, self-serving people I have ever met.  I have always found it a great, sad irony that two people who didn't really want children and never really took care of them had FOUR of them!  One of the things that makes me a little uneasy about ever having children of my own is the question of whether his parents just represent people who shouldn't have had children or if they represent people who actually just failed at parenting.  If they are just failures, does that mean there's a chance that I might fail too?  That in fact, they tried, yet still came up short?  Is parenting something you inherit genetically, or is it something learned or possibly not?  It broke my heart to see Brent the way he was.  Sad, feeling defeated, alone.  My parents saw him just as they were leaving on a dog-walk and asked if he'd like to come in to eat what was leftover from dinner.  He didn't hesitate to say yes and gobbled down what my parents put in front of him.  He looked like he hadn't slept well or had a good meal in weeks.  Sure, probably three to be exact.  He's got money-troubles, just smashed his car up rei good, and can now expect his insurance to go up and his chances of getting a bike this summer to vanish completely.  His parents aren't going to help him with school after all, and he's got nowhere to live come September.  He laid all this out for me, and almost instinctually I could feel my mind start to work out a solution.   OK, he can do this, then this, then this... then things should start to improve.   But instead, I held my tongue.  I can't give him that anymore.  I can only tell him how badly I feel for him, assure him that he can always feel free to talk to me about these things, and leave it at that.  OK, so I gave him a teeny-weeny bit of financial advice, but since it was advice that had actually come from Anil in the first place I felt it was OK to offer.    And yeah, I sent him a text mssg the next morning telling him to make sure he had something good to eat.  But, jesus!  When he told me that he had eaten a box of Triscuit over the course of his 10 hour work-day that day, I freaked out a little bit.  Shit, I spend money on food, if nothing else.  I'm dead-broke right now and I'd sooner spend money on nutrition while at school than buy subway fare.  It's just like that.  Like what does it matter if you have gas in your car or weed in your hand if you haven't had a bite to eat all week?    Isn't all that just so typical, though?  Totally symptomatic of my   need   to influence him, to mother him, to tell him how to live.  I need to fight those urges, just like he needs to fight his urges to come to me with stuff like that.  Oy, and to make it worse, I couldn't resist telling Mike some of that too.  Poor Mike, he knows waaay too much about my relationship with Brent, and the ante-relationship we have now.  Waaay too much.  Here I am criticizing Brent for bringing too much baggage to me, and now I'm going to dump baggage all over Mike too.  Mom sometimes lets some pretty dumb-ass things slip out (she's got the same problem as I do: the need to control (oops!  I mean "influence") people.)  She said to me, in light of the Monday visit from Brent, that she didn't think we should be friends.  Not yet anyway.   Yeah Mom, no shit.   Instead of telling me what she had decided, she could have asked me what I thought I should do, then made the suggestion.  Well, of course, she wouldn't have needed to make the suggestion because I would have told her that I had already thought of that idea.  Lucky me that I'm almost 24 years old, and my Mommy is still there to decide what I'll wear to school in the morning.  Faak.  And with that in mind, I'll be asking to borrow her car in about half an hour.  I wonder, will I get a bitch-session or will she just let me have the damn thing?

      I sit "hungrily" at my desk, (perhaps a la ee cummings?) and  devour  everything in sight.  This large cuppa duble-duble, this delicious little butter-tart, which I  DON'T  need, and the blog of my dearest (though certainly not nearest) friend.    In reading her latest, I can't help but think that there is a very heavy weight of sadness on her shoulders, and basically nothing I can do.  Three and a half hurts is a lot, and it's only June.  Buddha would say that we cannot ask why, because we know that the disappointments we see are old sleights come to fruition.  He would say that we can only accept the hard-times as inevitable, and take what we can from them in the way of learning experience.  Would I tell her that?  Heck no!  I'm no sage, but I would say that we should ask why!  The hard-times we have NOW aren't always a result of actions so long ago they can hardly be recalled, but sometimes they are snowballed results of poor choices that happened in the not-so-distant past.  And when I say "poor choices" I don't mean in the uber-moral, existential sort of way, but just poor insofar as they weren't best suited to oneself.  WHY should be a question asked about the situation, and even a little bit about oneself.  Why did I choose this situation, and why did it not work out to be the best for me?  Yup, in the manner of all well-intended advice, easier said than done.  Something that's stuck with me was her question:  What do I change ?  Wow.  My question is this:   Why should YOU change  ?  I don't even mean that to be rhetorical, but it's something that I've asked myself a thousand times, especially in the last six months or so.  For example, I know my dear, distant friend to be an intelligent, witty, hilariously funny, cute, adorable, and beautifully graceful woman whom I adore.  Why does she get her heart broken?  Only because, I think, she's trusting it with the wrong people.  That makes sense, doesn't it?  If there's nothing wrong with A, there's gotta be something wrong with B.  And since I  know  there's nothing wrong with A, there must be something very wrong with variable B.  So what's the answer?  To close yourself up, to make yourself emotionally unavailable?  To change the most fundamental aspects of your character that the people who already know you love???   No fucking way!   Change is an inevitable part of life, but forced change, especially if it goes against your character is never a good idea.  It's like those lucky ones with naturally blonde hair and the millions of women that try to pretend to be just like them even though their blonde comes out of a box of Clairol.  They've still got their natural whatever underneath, it'll always show through.  The other side of that analogy is the woman with the naturally blonde hair that dyes it black.  The tragedy!  She's got something that millions of women envy, and she's gonna throw it away just so she doesn't have to listen to another blonde joke again.  Hopefully you're picking up what I'm putting down here.  You're a fabulous person: don't change just because you got hurt by someone who couldn't see the beauty and light that is you.

      ...And I've decided that it's for me.  I'm going on permanent vacation, never to return.  I figure I'll just live as a sun-tanning ascetic, living off the generosity of friends, family members, the government...heck, whoever will give me money!  OK, teeny lie.  I'm back at work today (much to my chagrin) but had an excellent time while off.  So excellent that I really couldn't justify spending any time in my dank basement to download tunes, or email, or blog...   hee-hee-hee-oops !  So now I'm back at work, back to abusing the resources made available to me...tit-for-tat, I think.  And I've got the perspective needed, now that I'm back in hell, to appreciate the very good time I had while off work.  Hmm...  Friday night: went to Sharkeys (!!!) with Mike and some of his friends.  It was a great night, even though everyone there was at least two or three years younger than me ( this is especially odd in that I was partying in the same spot as many of my friends'  younger  siblings--like Bridget's little bro!  I don't suppose he's really "little" anymore, but in my eyes he'll probably always be the bratty little punk that always gave us a hard time whenever Bridge & I hung out at her place .)  In terms of hanging out with Mike, it totally confirmed my suspicion that going to a bar and partying with your boyfriend is absolutely the most fun.  Brent & I never did that, except on my 19th birthday (which I do not remember...) and on that fateful night at the Madison when things really started to fall apart.  It always seemed like a really big source of fun and socializing that he & I missed out on, so it's really nice to be able to do this with Mike.  In fact, it's really nice to do a lot of things with Mike.  We went to the Georgetown Highland games on the weekend, and we're going to the zoo next weekend.  It's really...nice.   Where's my thesaurus...?

      I was recently going through my work emails, and found a "goodbye" email from a former co-worker, that he sent out on his last day.  Ever the firecracker, his email was sharp and to the point.  Here it is...  * * * "Choice or Chance  We all have the ability to choose what we want from life. We cannot control or predict everything that happens, but we can make thoughtful decisions and actions towards designing our own life.  Often we get fooled into believing that it is wiser and better to stay in our current circumstances. We convince ourselves that we might not be successful in our attempts for something else. Fear of loss, regret and failure stalls or completely stops us. We start to believe that something will shift on its own to make our dream happen if it was meant to be.  Therefore, the only possibility of getting what we truly desire is by chance.  Consider that protecting what you have by "keeping things the same" is no guarantee that they won't change on their own anyway. Your job may become redundant and market demands may shift. Your friends might move and your partner may change his/ her mind.  Consider that where you are now does not represent where you will always be. Nothing is fixed. In fact, as we grow, a step backward may enable two steps forward.  More choices than we think  Take a look at our choices. Often, people see their choices in terms of yes/no, win/lose, stop/go or good/bad. In reality, there are very few decisions or actions we take that only involve a black or white solution.  More times than not, there are multiple outcomes. We, in fact, have many more choices than we initially see.  Seeing more possibilities creates space, flexibility and opportunity.  Beyond actions, we can always choose how we think, feel, act and respond.  We choose our beliefs, our perspective, our outlook, our priorities and our response. Embracing our ability to direct our thoughts and feelings delivers us a stronger sense of purpose, confidence and satisfaction.  Do you have a better chance of getting what you want by hoping it will happen or taking an active role in making it happen? If your ship sank, would you make every effort to find the lifeboat or float around in the spot you landed and hope that someone found you there? Choice offers you the opportunity to actively participate in the making of your own life and increases your opportunity for success.  From the Book: Knowing Your Strengths (The Gallop Group, 1999)  Cheers,  Mark  P.S. Over the past few years I have had the "Importance of Statistics" rammed down my throat. I am a true believer that statistics do not represent the quality or quantity of work that an individual may perform.   "A persons day to day routine is not always routine".  Mark Davidson, (1968- )   "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."  Albert Einstein (1879-1955)

      ...and failing, I think!  So take this for what it's worth...an extremely cautious, though optimistic confession.  Things with Mike have taken a new turn, and he is no longer the  urlLink wrong one  as I thought he was.  In fact, he's feeling more and more right by the second.  OK, now that sounds a little ... uh, what's the positive version of 'nihilist'?  Hmm, dunno.  But it sounds far more decisive than it really is.  All of the reasons I initially thought it wouldn't ever work with Mike are the same reasons that I am totally digging this guy.    He's young: yeah, well, so's Anil, and it was never an issue.  It may just be that Mike looks his age, whereas Anil looks more than his age, (although, with his baby-face Mike will likely look like a child perpetually.)  Common interests: it's called sharing.  As in, he shares his interests with me, some of them I dig and some not so much, and I share with him--same deal.  But the places where we differ, we learn, and perhaps that's where a lot of the affection is rooted too.  And don't think I haven't already considered the "same shit, different pile" paradigm.  Am I being rash and hasty in getting involved with Mike?  Absolutely.  But since when have I behaved any way, other than totally heedlessly self-indulgent?  And with that in mind (ie: heedless self-indulgence) here is the ultimate reason why we're hitting it off so well: he is crazy about me.  And he lets me care about him without any restraint.  Anil wanted me to play games, he liked when I was hard-to-get, he didn't ever want to know how I  really  felt about him.  Mike lets me be every bit as affectionate as I want, no game-playing required.    Sooo... I like Mike a lot.  I'm gonna start carting him around to meet my friends, see what the general opinion is, etc.  The post-surgery instructions confirmed my mission: no sex for four weeks.  It will really give me a unique opporunity to explore just how much a part of a relationship sex really is.  Ally really likes him, which is a bonus  (as an aside: Mike and Ally coordinated a secret effort to plant a teddy-bear and get-well card in my room pre-surgery; he showed up with one of his most eligible friends, Trev, who is now desperate to get to know Ally.  When Mike told me this, my protective-sister instincts flared up immediately.  I protested that there was no way it could fly--he's 22, she's 19.  And Mike, gaah, counters with the argument that it's pretty much the same difference in age as he and I.  Shut uuuuuup !)  Now all I have to do is warm up my parents to the idea of a new boyfriend.  Mom has not been doing well lately.  Aside from all the stress of my surgery, she's also looking forward to an emergency root-canal later this week.  She is in a lot of pain, and has been for sometime, though she ignored it initially thinking it would go away.  I really want her to meet Mike, and I know she'll really like him.  But one thing that she made a point of saying just after I started seeing him casually was that she wasn't ready to meet anyone new yet.  It would take her a little more time to get over Brent.  If that isn't just the most misplaced irony, I don't know what is.  So this is me, cautious but optimistic, trying very hard to keep my head and heels in their correct fully upright position.

      I read one of those trashy celebrity gossip mags (or should I say "rags"?) today.  Yeah, when I say I read it, I mean it:  cover to cover.  And you know what I concluded?  Celebrities are far more cracked out than we give them credit; whatever probs I've got with NO-money, they've got worse with PLENTY-O-money; gossip column writers should be award-winning fictionaires.  And I read the whole thing from the comfort of my own bed.  Luckily not because I was bed-ridden, but because I just didn't want to leave the sunny comfort of my room.  My surgery, thank Allah, Buddha and Ganesh, went just fine.  There were some tense moments, ie: in the five minutes before I was to head into the OR, they still didn't have a bed to slice & dice me on, and there was also a little bit of confusion as to whether this would be a local anaesthetic, or a general.  "LOCAL???  I don't think so."  I asked the nurse if she might check my chart once more.  "Oh yes, here it is.  You're to go under general anaesthetic."  Damn skippy I am.  But I woke up with minimal pain (accepted a shot of morphine in the ass, just for good measure,) and went home without incident.  Here's the part that made the day so banner...  In the few days before my procedure, not surprisingly, I felt brutally alone and depressed.  Then on Sunday afternoon, Anil showed up.  We spent the afternoon together, hung out with Mattee and burned a couple joints down in bee-utiful Lyons Valley, kicked the soccer ball around for a bit, had dinner at Lick's (ah, memories...), and just generally had a laugh.  Monday morning, Brent showed up at about 10am.  He stayed with me and even drove me to the hospital.  I gotta say, I was a little shocked that he showed up, but also a little relieved since I was  hoping  he would.  He even came by afterwards to see how I was doing.  Sure, his annoyingly chirpy cell phone dragged him away not long after he showed up, but the fact that he made the trip said enough.  "I'd still do anything for you," he told me.  Thanks B, you don't know how much that means.  I had an out-pouring, literally, of support from my friends.  A ridiculously long-distance call from Bridge, a heart-warmingly supportive and funny message left from my QueenMo, and many others.  But B walked me right to the mouth of the lion's den, holding my hand the whole way.  At least in the break-up we haven't lost sight of the feelings that  weren't  hurt.  And now it's all over with.  I don't have any more nasty surgery to dread (I hope), just a couple of years of cuddling-sessions with my specialist.  Not to go ahead bashing when this post has been so positive, but one of the things that the break-up did was show me who I've got.  When I was with Brent, the tunnel-vision was totally detrimental to almost every other relationship I had.  I ignored so many of my friends because I was with B so much of the time.  Something that I came to resent quite a bit.  But now I'm on my own, so to speak, with absolutely no reason to feel lonely.  TO MY FRIENDS,  THANK YOU .  I LOVE YOU, I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU, I'M GLAD YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I NEED YOU.

       It's Ally's 19th birthday tomorrow . She's going to Hess Village. She's very, very excited. I can understand why--you only turn 19 once!&nbsp; And she's among the last of her friends to turn 19, of those young'uns that don't have a fake I.D., of course.&nbsp;   My Mom had me go to the mall last night to get her some gift certificates and a little something special. She had no idea what to get Ally, but I figured it would be most practical to&nbsp; get her something that she can wear out on Sunday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, shopping is totally my forte, but whenever it's shopping for Ally I'm lost.&nbsp; Her tastes are so...diverse.&nbsp; On the one hand, she's big into sweats and big-Ts.&nbsp; On the other hand, she goes out wearing halters and tube-tops--stuff I've NEVER had the courage to wear!&nbsp; I got her this really cute sheer top with big, thick black & white stripes and a little beaded flower on the shoulder.   I pulled it out when I got home and my Dad was like "You can see right through that. Oh, she can't wear that out."  Yes she can, Dad .  Mom: "I still don't understand why she's got it in her head that she HAS to go out, and why does she have to go and get studpid drunk?"  Mom, you only turn 19 once. Jeepers! You'd think like she's getting a tattoo and not just going out for a few drinks with her friends!   It's crazy to think about Ally being 19.&nbsp; I've still got it stuck in my head that she's only 14, just a little punk kid stealing my clothes and driving me nuts.&nbsp; But she's no kid anymore.&nbsp; She's a young lady.&nbsp; She'll be going to college soon, after that doing the same thing I'm doing: just trying to figure out where she'll fit in, in an adult world.&nbsp; She's a supervisor at her job now, a promotion she got after being there for only a year.&nbsp; Sure, it's just KFC, but I'm damn proud of her.&nbsp; It's giving her a real sense of responsibility that I don't think she's getting at home.&nbsp; I guess it was the same for people watching me grow up, 'cause I'm just marvelling at Ally.&nbsp; Some of the things that she says when we talk just astound me.&nbsp; I can take advice from her and trust it--she's going through the same things that I have, and she's learning some really valuable lessons.  And now she's 19.&nbsp; She's gonna have a bit of a tough time getting into a bar without a driver's license, but I suppose she'll just have to make do.  I'm really excited for her, and on top of that, I'm really excited that now she can come and hang out with me and my friends. I've extended the invitation to her, so I hope that she takes it.&nbsp; I'd love to bring her out with me sometime when I'm going out to a bar.&nbsp; I think she'd have a lot of fun hanging out with big sis, and I think I'd have a lot of fun hanging out with little sis.&nbsp;   It's possible that she stays with that craphead of a loser "boyfriend"  (who she's still not admitting to still seeing, forget that I found them both asleep on the couch&nbsp;in the basement this morning...)  because she's got nowhere else to go. I think that if she sees how much fun she can have without him, she might not feel so attached...   It seems like sucha parallel to what happened with Brent. Mona said it best: it seemed like whenever I talked about having fun, it was when I was going out without him. You're so smart Mona. Do me a favour? The next time I bitch to you about something, and you offer me some of your sage advice, can you also include the line   "Do what I say because I'm smarter than you"   ? I'd really appreciate the reminder.  &nbsp;

      OK, so I realize I'm probably scaring the be-jesus out of whoever faithfully reads my blog, so here's a wee bit of an update as far as the health situation...   On Wednesday I went to a walk-in clinic (gaah!!!) because I had a real itch to have a speculum jammed in me.&nbsp; Hmmph.&nbsp; It was nerve-wracking, totally, sitting in that waiting room, over-analyzing everything...&nbsp;   Did I have to stutter when the nurse asked why I was here?&nbsp; Why are my hands shaking?&nbsp; I hope it's a female doctor...&nbsp;     When the doctor came in I was relieved to see it was a woman, even if the relief was only marginal. "Your sheet says that you want an STD test?&nbsp; Can I ask why?"  I explained the situation to her, that I have cervical dysplasia, that I don't feel that either my GP or my specialist have been pro-active in terms of my sexual health, and I can't remember the last time I even had an STD test.&nbsp; And of course, I had been with Brent for five years...but then there was Anil, and now Mike.   "Well, if you're going through partners, it's really best to use condoms..." she said.  Yeah, we're using them, but it would be nice not to have a  heart-attack  if ever they don't get used, ok?&nbsp; Is it just me, or is it near impossible to get a straight answer or simple obedience from anyone in the medical field???&nbsp;   To give the woman some credit, once I explained the situation to her, she hashed things out pretty clearly, and she cut me some slack: "It seems like you've really gone through a lot in the last couple of months, and I can understand why you're very anxious to put all this behind you."&nbsp; You're damn right!   She gave me a whole battery of tests, and really reassured me, to tell the truth.&nbsp; She told me that I got referred to Princess Margaret because I'm young and an otherwise healthy young woman, so they want the best doctors with the best resources to get on top of this right away, so that they can eliminate it from my life.&nbsp; Yeah, that would be really nice...   Later on, I called my Mom--she said&nbsp;my specialists' office had called, and I have an appointment on August 5 at Princess Margaret.&nbsp; I'm glad to know that it's soon, though I'm still a little scared about what's going to happen next.&nbsp; The bottom line with all of this: it's a waiting game.&nbsp; All I can do is wait for my appointment at PM, wait for information from them afterwards, and then wait, wait, wait for my next follow-up appointment, and very likely more surgery.&nbsp; I'm not looking forward to more surgery, but I'll do whatever it takes to get this done.   On Friday, Ashley took me out for lunch.&nbsp; I decided I'd tell him what was going on.&nbsp; Ashley's one of the few people at work that I like, other than my very favorite Mona, and I really feel like I can trust him.&nbsp; Mostly, he was just concerned with how I was feeling on the psychological side.&nbsp; After losing a friend to a mental illness, one that he was completely unaware of, I can understand that he's going to be very observant from now on.&nbsp; I assured him that I'm doing ok, and it's true.&nbsp; So many friends have offered their support, and my parents are starting to understand more and be angry less.   And as far as my checklist...   1.&nbsp;I've taken&nbsp;a multi-vitamin everyday since last week,    2. I'm drinking a ton of water,   although admittedly, when I go out on the town I'm drinking a lot of drinks that contain very little water...    3. Going   to school two days a week means plenty of walking ,  but I still haven't seen the inside of&nbsp; my gym.&nbsp; Why am I so scared to go back?    4. This is the only one I've failed miserably at: More Sleep.&nbsp; I need it desperately, but I've just&nbsp; been so busy this week.&nbsp; I will make a stronger conscious effort.

      Because of one event almost 7 years ago, and because of a thing that occurred at the same time that happened without my knowledge, I just received the worst news of my life yesterday.   In December 2003, as happens at the end of every year, I had a PAP test. Doctors and other health care workers educate us of the need for preventative health care -- catch it before it becomes a problem. Every year I have a PAP test. I sit up on that table while an overly hairy man dives in up to his elbows in my crotch. Checking stuff out. But this PAP was different. This time, a month later, I got a call. The PAP results were "abnormal" and they've booked me in with a specialist. Just like that.   This new doc, we'll call him Dr Dentures because I really am worried that some day I'll walk out of his office with a set of his poorly affixed teeth in my pussy, he told me not to worry, just to be diligent. We'd do a colposcopy (peek-a-boo in the down-there area with a fancy camera) and possible a LEEP procedure. After the colposcopy, he said that it wasn't just dysplasia; it was   urlLink high-grade dysplasia  .   I remember very clearly asking him:  "Just how long does it take to go from everything's a-ok to high-grade?"  "Well," he said, "How long was it since your last PAP?"  "A year," I said.  "Then it takes a year."   A month ago, I had surgery to remove a part of my cervix. A "part" my doctor called it. A cone was burnt out because it contained cells that he called dysplasic, but more accurately are pre-cancerous cells. He told me that this surgery would remove the cells and keep me from developing cancer. Just as long as there is no abnormal growth, there's nothing to go to cancer. Ok, fine. He just told me to report back in a month, and we'd talk about the results.   Yesterday, a month was up. Yesterday, I went to his office, a part of me fretting madly, and a part of me trying to reassure myself that truly, everything was ok. The results: Everything is not ok.   "We had a look at your cervix, and it seems that the dysplasia was a little further along than we had originally thought. It seems that it had taken over virtually all the surface of your cervix. We removed the minimum amount that we safely could."  "So does that mean that you didn't get it all?" Mom asked him.  "No, I think we got most of it. Yeah, we got it all." He said.    Dr Dentures, you do NOT reassure me.  He was ready to dismiss me as soon as he finished answering Mom's question.  Woah, woah, woah! This is my body, and I've got a couple damn questions too!    "I'm still confused, doc. How did this happen? How did I go from having a normal PAP last year, to severe dysplasia this year?"   The quack didn't really answer me.  "No one really knows why some women develop dysplasia and some don't."  Yeah, thanks a whole fucking lot.    This is what I believe: I believe that my GP just wanted to ching-ching OHIP, and the PAP was him just going through the motions. He knew I had an STD years ago, and even though it was treated, he didn't connect the dots to any possibility of future reprecussins. He didn't treat me in accordance with any sort of preventative medicine. Just an "all's well" blinded sort of approach. My thoughts are that this dysplasia has been there for years. 2003 was just the first time he noticed.   "What about long-term affects?"  Come on doc, let's look ahead a bit.   "Well, I don't think you have anything to worry about,"  Oh no???  "As long as we keep following this carefully, your chances of developing cancer are really slim. And if you have to have a couple &nbsp;of procedures, that's ok. It's if you have to have 3 or 4 or 5 than there may be some concern about the shrinking of your cervix and your ability to hold onto a pregnancy."  So that's what it means, "nothing to worry about"??? I only have cancer and miscarriage to consider, eh?    He's sending me now to see a gynecological oncologist at Princess Margaret. Perfect. I'm not worried at all. I also made an appointment to see my GP. In his chivalrous largesse, he told me months ago that if ever I had any questions, not to hesitate to come and see him.  Yeah, I got a question: why the fuck didn't you find this shit years ago when it started???    Mom says that he will never admit to not seeing the dysplasia. He will always assert that it only just showed up. All the same, I want him to know that I know what he's done. I want him to be afraid. And I'm going to ask the specialist at Princess Margaret what their opinion is on how long it takes for severe dysplasia to form, because they won't know my docs and they won't have any loyalty to them.   This needs to end now, because I can't spend the day madly typing away. I am going outside to enjoy this beautiful day, because there are things in life more beautiful than this, so I want them.

      Because this is an unprecedented week. I am feeling absolutely helpless, without recourse, and utterly confused.   * * * Before anyone reads on, because I know I have a few loyal readers, this is not a shiny, happy post. It's gonna be dark, and you're gonna want to hear this from my mouth. But I need to get this out. So read on if you must, but read carefully. * * *   On Monday, work people gathered together to witness the committal of our friend Steve to the earth. The service was long, and sad, and bitter-sweet as funerals always are. They are the times that people, long-lost friends, come together again. But it's always the worst time for a reunion. In honesty, the thing that kept me together, the thing that prevented me from airing out all my sadness in public at that service was that jack-ass guy with the radio-announcer voice.  Buddy, you are far too earnestly enthusiastic about our dead friend. For Pete's sake, please shut the fuck up , I wanted to scream on half a dozen occasions within that two hours. I held my tongue, because not everybody hates radio announcers.   The reality really hasn't set in yet. It's probably because I'm still only part-time at work, and even then, only seeing my part-time hours, part-time. Making it to work has not been my forte as of late. More on that in a moment...   Yesterday, during my very brief stay at work, Ashley came and talked to me. He has not been handling this well, I know, and I avoided talking to him first because I didn't want him to feel pressured to talk about anything he's not comfortable with yet. But he came and talked to me. He actually got choked up a couple of times, and I felt terrible telling him I had to leave. But I had to leave...   It's a very odd situation, this thing at work. How many people there am I really tight with? Mona, of course; Ashley, a bit; and that's really it. No one else really knows anything about me,&nbsp; I don't really know anything about anybody else. Nothing really personal, anyway. And death, and the way it can affect you, is such a personal thing. Here we are, this group of strangers united by a common employer, having only each other to rely in this dark, sad, confusing time. No one is talking about it, but no one has yet denied the truth of Steve's death. His friend, a pastor, called it a sickness, his sadness. He said that Steve succame to his sickness like anyone else might. His friend, the pastor, also used his time at the podium to deliver a little conversion sermon. This also, I found, to be extremely inappropriate, just like Mr. Radio Announcer Voice. He made me question the existence of god more than ever. He said that the light and goodness in Steve was special. I agree. But he said it was special because it was the light of god. That's bullshit, as far as I'm concerned. Steve wasn't a good man because some omnipotent power was controlling him. He was a good man because that's who he is. Just like some people have allergies, or blonde hair, or a limp--that's just who he is. It's not a random formulation, but the sum total of innumerable factors. I guess when people can't count high enough, they forget the numbers and just call it "god". But I wonder, if Steve's goodness was god, what was Steve's sadness?   Is it only our weaknesses that belong to us, and our strengths only to a higher power? That makes no sense to me. It's all or nothing, and if it all belongs to god, then what the fuck are we even doing here? We're here because it all belongs to us. The good, the bad, everything in between. Anything we can experience with our senses is 100% fundamentally human, mortal, and belonging to us.   God doesn't choose who lives and who dies, there's no choice at all. Choice is an illusion. The most important, the most life-altering things in our existence completely supercede the realm of&nbsp;"choice". When, where, how you're born: not your choice. Whether you're born blind or limb-less, whether you live a fortunate life or an unfortunate one: it is beyond our choosing.   And I can say that because my life has been altered in an entirely unforseeable way by a single act that happened one night in the summer of 1997. Had I been able to see forward to this day, many things would have been different. But we don't have the gift of foresight as humans, only hindsight. We cannot learn of the future, only of the past.

      Time to talk about one of the best weekends I've had in a loooooong time. Weekend started a little shaky. Having a crappy Friday at work is never good. The second I walked in the door--gasp!--a call from the distant friend I've been jonesin' for...and what seemed like virtually endless harassment from my Mom throughout the entire call. A pox on the man that invented the speaker phone that allows my parents to pick up undetected on any call (which of course is then blasted at high volume throughout the first floor of our house) and hollar in media res into whatever conversation they like. Faak.  &nbsp;  Luckily, my golden knight showed up--although, sadly, I was nowhere near done my conversation, and even more sadly I wanted nothing more than to get the faak outta the nuthouse I call home.  &nbsp;  The plan was pizza and a flick. The "plan" didn't happen quite that way.  "You feel like a beer or two?"  "Don't I always? What's the catch?"  "You feel like going and hanging out over at Jordan's place for a little while?" Hmm... Jordan, part of the original group from the Maddy; not a bad guy, but friends with Tom, so I'm always a little suspicous of where his loyalties are.  "Yeah, OK, Jordan's it is."  &nbsp;  **************************************** Saturday was a blast. I slept late...I slept late after Mike dropped me off, because he told him slave-driver of a boss that he'd work (!!!), which I guess was ok. Ally and I went to mall, and I got a super-cute little mini-skirt. Yow. Hopefully it had a  Mike, don't work on the weekends sort of sex-appeal . Read on for the answer.  &nbsp;  Mike's best-friends Matt (aka Ches) and Trev (aka T-Luck) have little neat little house in the (student?) ghetto of St. Catharines (is St. Kitt's anything but a ghetto???) Whatev. Anyway, we chilled out there for a few hours. Drank beers. Many beers. Tossed around the ball. No, really. It's been a while since I've hung out with intensely male guys -- Mattee doesn't quite count, because, afterall, he is "Met" Mattee -- and they are really, really... uh, GUYS. Have I mentioned, ever, just how absolutely gorgeously cute Mike is? 'Cause perhaps I should mention that in conjunction with a little bit of a boast about jumping him (and that's molesting, not robbing,) when he went upstairs to get changed. Yeah, no really, I was going upstairs to get changed too. Ahem. I might have been a little more reserved if I had realized how damn sweaty I was gonna get 20 mins before we had to leave for this bar, but...meh. And it was worth it, yowsa! Talk about blowing off steam!  &nbsp;  We went to this place called My Cottage -- a bar in Port Dalhousie that's like 80% patio. Really. "What the heck do they do in the winter?" I asked. The answer: it's only open from the May 2-4 to Labour Day weekend, or something fucked up like that. My Cottage is right on the water, so people literally dock at the bar. Nutso-smasho. And the place was bouncing! They had a pretty decent DJ, and the crowd was really, really good. Matt &amp; Trev tried --unsuccessfully-- to pick up, but had a good time with us nonetheless. I got an indecent proposal from one of the hottest girls I've ever seen. Nothing came of it, there's just no reason to give any guy anything to jerk-off to later. I don't know why Matt &amp; Trev can't seem to find THE GIRL.  &nbsp;  Matt keeps going for friends that he already has, and can't understand why they only see him platonically; Trev keeps going for girls that have boyfriends. I can sort of understand the double-pull conundrum they're in: the desperate want to be with someone (or just the blanket fear of being alone) and the serious contract-clause of not wanting to waste time with the wrong one. Before we left the house, I walked into the living room to find Mike and Matt having a conversation about love and relationships. I overheard enough to hear Mike talking, or boasting is more like it, about finding me.  "You just gotta be patient. There are more than enough roadblocks that will pop up in any relationship, so you just have to take it easy. I mean, five years, man. That's a lot to contend with. [This is when I walked in.] But it's worth it, man, it's so worth it if she's the one for you."  &nbsp;  Awwwww!  &nbsp;  Mike is a fantastic dancer. I have never dated a guy who danced before. I love it! We just mesh so well. He's a fantastic friend and I am sooo attracted to him. He's so confident and self-assured, but totally lacking in conceit. Trev was eyeing this group of girls and was agonizing over how to talk to them, so Mike just called them over. Yup, just like that. Of course, really the girls got fooled by the old bait-and-switch: I could tell almost immediately that having another girl there (me) was not helping Trev's chances of talking to these chicks. So I told Mike, who was being fiercely chatted up by several of these girls, that I was going to grab another beer. He gave me a big sweet kiss, and you better believe I looked back as I walked away. Yep, those little chiquitas were not happy that he wasn't as available he had first seemed. When I got back with my beer, most of the girls were gone. Ha!  &nbsp;  It's really the little things, the little ego-stroking things that endear him. Like the way that he whispers in my ear that I'm the most beautiful girl, or the way he completely ignores his friends when he's just staring into my eyes. Oh, gosh, am I blushing???  &nbsp;  All things said, we had a fantastic time at this bar, and I got just loaded! I tried to remember on Sunday morning just how many I had had -- I put in the range of about 8 or 9. A lot for little me. We caught a cab home, and Matt started up with talk about "Emilio". As in, "Mag--when we get home, you've gotta meet Emilio."  "Who's Emilio?" our very young, hip cabbie asked.  After some chuckling, "Emilio is our giant bong, man."  "Well, I don't normally do this, but you guys seem pretty cool. I keep a bit with me--my work stash--to smoke when it gets a little dull late into the night."  &nbsp;  And I'll be a monkey's uncle if this super-cool cabbie, Paul, didn't smoke us on two of the dopest joints I've had in a while. Sitting in the backseat, I was fourth out of five to get passed to, and looking at this piddly joint, I didn't think it would make it around for a second pass. I got completely fucked. This was some of the most serious dope I've ever had. And this was the coolest cabbie I've ever had. We laughed and laughed until I thought we were all gonna die. Buddy gave us his card, and told us to call him sometime.  &nbsp;  "Paul, seriously, you are the coolest guy. You know where we live now, so anytime you wanna come over, like on breaks on your shift, whatever, just come on by. We won't forget you!" Matt was seriously ready to pin a poster of this guy to his wall and start worshipping!  &nbsp;  Later,&nbsp;Matt &amp; I went to the 7-11 and had a little bonding moment. He called me "Mag" and freaked out about it at first. "Oh, shit. Can I call you that, is that ok?"  "Matt, I mean Ches, I'd be hurt if you didn't call me that!"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Mike passed out sooo easily. He went upstairs while we were smoking our third joint of the night, and I thought for sure he was talkin' to God on the big white telephone. But nope, he was passed out in the first bedroom he walked past. Sunday morning I was in rough shape. Went out onto the back deck just before 8am, wanting some fresh air. Fertilized the plants while I was out there, too. I hope puke doesn't kill plants. Meh, whatev. When I got back upstairs, Mike was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  &nbsp;  "I'm just gonna grab a quick shower and then we can go."  &nbsp;  Go? I was really unsure of whether or not a car-ride right then was gonna be a good thing, but if Mike was ok to drive, I would have much prefered his bed to this stranger's bed. It was a rough ride, but we made it back to his place without incident and slept until almost 2 o'clock. The rest of our Sunday was just so sweet. We lounged around in bed, chatted and laughed. Went out for a late lunch-early dinner. Then Mike passed out again for a few hours! At about 8:30 when he woke up again, we went outside and had a little bonfire. We played with the horses, got extremely muddy. Then he took me back to bed, carrying me hero-style.  &nbsp;  This guy, oh my. Mike has made me forget about a lot. Maybe too much. And maybe I should think about that a little bit...and then share it with the world in my next post.

      OK, firstly, I need this disclaimer: I love taking stupid quizzes, but I will never, never, EVER admit it. Until now. When it's a quiz that involves my favorite, and perhaps the  BEST  movie ever made, heck--I'm gonna put my results on a t-shirt.      You are The Dread Pirate Roberts. Your combination  of boyish good lucks and eyes like the sea may  be irresistable to women. After all, they are  only human. Just remember that fantasies can't  last forever and that you should always keep in  mind a woman's inner beauty. Even fairy tale  princesses can get stretchmarks!

      It's a lack of sleep, coupled with a bit of anxiety, compounded by parents who seem like the most grossly insensitive people ever (!!!), and made sappy by a terrible longing for distant friends.  Steve's funeral is on Monday.  I'll be carpooling with people from work, and we were told today that as a salute to Steve, his wife wants us all to wear jeans and our favorite t-shirt.  'Cause that's just the kind of guy Steve was, and since we obviously didn't do enough for him while he was alive, we ought to at least fulfill this.  I'm still just so ... heartbroken over this.  I try to picture what his last moments must have been like.  Was he in pain or was he strong and resolute at that point?  I have such a hard time understanding what kind of pain seems so hopeless that there's no solution.  A really hard time.  To think that he was this fantastic man, loved by so many, but who felt like he was so alone, is the most tragic thing I've ever heard of.  It makes me so grateful for all the people that I know I can count on--people who can't always offer solutions, but who can at least offer a laugh.  That's the best part about good friends, no?  My parents have been absolutely the most insensitive people lately.  Like, for Pete's sake, the surgery that I had, and they never even asked about it!  All I've heard in the weeks since has been the toothache that my Mom got  very coincidentally  the night before my surgery.  Granted, she had to have a root-canal, so it's not like she made it up, she just seemed to completely forget about me.  She also made some pretty dumb-ass comments to me when I told her about Steve.  Comments of the "What the fuck, why didn't you (collectively) notice?" variety.   Fuck off, Mom, like that's not what's been going through the heads of every person he ever knew.   I keep thinking that it's something related to her.  My behavior has been pretty much the same, in fact I've been doing a lot more to help her out, especially since I'm not in Milton half the time anymore.  She's been really forgetful, as well as really moody, so it's gotta be either THE CHANGE or maybe a thyroid problem?  But of course, like any woman, I know that the thought of someone ever blaming a woman's mood on a her cycle is enough to warrant daggers to the eyes.  So I'll keep my mouth shut.  I hope, I hope, I hope she figures it out.  I've got my post-op chit-chat with my doc next Wednesday.  We'll get to talk about what he saw and what he found and what the next steps are.  Oh, dear bloggy, I really hope that everything is ok.  I really hope he doesn't say " oops !" or " How about some more surgery ?" or " wait, I knew I forget to tell you something... "  I'm usually such an optimist, but this stuff has just got me petrified beyond belief.  I don't wanna die, and I wanna have kids.  As long as nothing happens counter to that, life is sweet.  Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.   OK, enough of that.  Worrying sure as fuck won't help me sleep, and it won't change anything anyway.  I think Ally is back with her loser boyfriend.  And, I'm pretty damn sure that he's not working.  Again.  At least this job lasted for almost two months.  That's a record for Jeff.  The lazy shit.  There go Ally's paycheques for the rest of the summer.  I wish that asshole would just leave her alone.  I wish Ally would place a higher value on herself and stop dating such retawds.  Faak.  So many things in life I wish I could change and can't.  It's impossible to read this blog without feeling a little depressed, so maybe on that note I'll put an end to this misery (and log-out).  I'll try back in a few days when things don't seem so grim.  Maybe Sunday--Mike's taking me out for a super-fun-day tomorrow.  He owes me BIG TIME!  He's been working so much lately, not getting home until 8 or 9 or even 11 at night!  Then getting up at 6 the next morning and doing it all over again.  He'll pick me up on his way home, then drop me off on his way out to work again.  I hate just getting to sleep next to the guy, I wanna actually go out on the town with him, dammit!  So luckily he's also feeling the same way, so Saturday is our day.  No one elses, just ours.  It should be a really good day, and either way, my faithful blog-readers, you'll hear about it.
