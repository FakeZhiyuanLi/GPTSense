      Well I'm not exactly there yet- tomorrow I will be.  And I can't wait- they haven't seen me since October- and I'm at least 20lbs lacking what I was then. And my dress is hot- and it will all be great.  But the sad, pitiful, and pathetic thing is that all I can think about are fried pickles from Razoo's (don't make that face they are heavenly). I hate that I am looking forward to them so much, and I'm hoping to at be reasonable in my points targets for the weekend. I mean I know its a wedding and all- so I know I won't be saintly, but still.  I weigh in tomorrow and I feel that the number will stay the same or go up slightly. I did scale hop yesterday, but it was after dinner- so I didn't take that number seriously. :) Just being silly and neurotic.  Now for the deep dark confessions- am I a bad person to crave the compliments I hope to get in Texas? From everyones reaction last time, I'm pretty sure they will be gushing. And I wont be taking away from the bride- cause she is amazing. But I need that lift- that boost of confidence, I need to know that I look good. Oh I'm an awful person- I know.

      So I've given up the website, for a blog site. More of a creative outlet I guess, and I'm inspired by the hordes of other blogs I'm in love with.   While mine is still an infant, hopefully it will get better soon!

      I wish I had the time and dedication and imagination to be as diligent a blogger as the others are.&nbsp; But alas, I cannot, Work school and life in general give me plenty of ideas, but no time.  Like the other day was taking a walk during my lunch break and her this woman tell her companion "yeah I'll be late for dinner, I'm getting arrested tomorrow." It was obvious she had pre-planned her week to include this protest, and subsequent incarceration.&nbsp; How wonderful I thought- it just made me smile.&nbsp; And I was inspired to write about it- but have I? No.  I also want to write what it's like to be where I am, to have gone through this journey.&nbsp; I want to be funny, eloquent, emotional and heartfelt. But I babble, and I don't make much sense, to myself, or to others.  I need structure. Maybe in August. :) Yes August sounds good.

      So I weighed in on friday and was up 2.6lbs. And I knew the woman weighing me in would comment, and without fail "ohhhh were you expecting that?"  Yes I was- I was anticipating a 2.6 lbs spike in my weight! Well I kinda was- I  mean vacation was a vacation after all. But I've been back on program for the past week and a half- and I think I've recovered the 2.6 already. So now lets hope its down another 1 or 2 more for friday's weigh in.  I went to church on saturday, and by accident chose the Spanish Mass. So since I don't speak Spanish it was a wonderful opportunity for me to sit and reflect- on life, on my weight, and things in general.  I sat and thought about how many times I had prayed that God would make me skinny. I prayed in church, I prayed in bed before sleep, I prayed in dressing rooms.  I always hoped that there would be the one day when I would wake up and be thin.  As a sidebar to all these prayers I would ask for the strength to lose weight- cause I really always knew that I wasn't just going to wake up skinny. And here I am- 18 months after having embarked on the weight loss journey that is changing my life- and I realized that my prayers were finally answered.  I do have the strength to do this.  I would always start diets and be off after little or no success.  Or I would vow that life is meant to be enjoyed - and I wouldn't deprive myself.  Well these past 18 months have seen roughly 86 lbs come off, and I'm still hoping to shed another 45 in the next year.   Of course its funny looking back cause I read a journal entry with all the things I wanted and prayed for: a job, weight loss, a boyfriend, and the strength to follow my dreams, and here I am 18 months later with a job,  a boyfriend, a successful weight loss journey, and 1 year of graduate school down.  So when it is said that God works in mysterious ways-I guess its right. Because s(he) didn't give me anything- per se- rather showed me what I already possesed.  And I think that is what God does.  Shows us the path, instead of giving us the map. Eh- i'm getting philosohpical- its been that kind of mood lately. :)

      Yes just back from a week of reading, sunning, sleeping and eating in the hills of Maine.  Not what you'd call a glamourous vacation (out-house), bur definately an indulgent one (donuts, booze, and general crap).  But I'm back and today I'm back on program. Doing very well too.  Plus because I'm out of school for the next month I can kick my own ass at the gym 5 times a week!  I was reading a recent comment made by Kirstie Alley regarding the current villification of her weight gain.  She mentions that obesity is not a disease and no one forced her to eat more than normal.  It made me think about my week of over-induglence.  I spent 5-7 days eating like it was going out of style. And I didn't even eat gourmet food, that would at least have been worth it. I broke rule number one of control and portion- it was awful. Why did I feel that this week would be my one chance to eat a smore for awhile?  Or ribs, or hot dogs? I mean its not like I can't make a 3 point smore at home anytime I want.  Where does this come from- what part of my brain says "well if you don't eat this now you will regret it!" Is it the same part of my brain that tells me when to buy something- and chastises me when I don't?  Ugh its so irritating. Even at dinner last night I couldn't choose something healthy- I had to go with fried chicken sandwich.  Because "I was still on vacation."  I guess this is one of those habits that I need to work on.                         Habits to Change:                                   -Stop giving myself a licesne to eat horribly for a specific reason.                                   - I'll think of others and update it.
