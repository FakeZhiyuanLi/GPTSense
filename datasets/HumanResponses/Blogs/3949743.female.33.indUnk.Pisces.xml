      Thank God!  I hate working, I swear!  My allergies are on a rampage today...can't see out of one eye.  Maybe I am just cursed.  Thank heavens for the weekends!

      The lions are at it again!  Unfortunately, I had to change my blog address, and re-do the entire thing.  The stupid, immature, stalking people at www.motodrive.com have decided that it wasn't enough to insult and degrade me on their own site.  They had to do it on my iVillage message board, and then start up all over again about my blog.    Evidently, I am a "dick sucking whore".  They hope I do break a leg or die.  How nice.  Isn't that sweet, grown up, human?    So, I did the best I could in moving the other posts over here...see below.  Hopefully, I can just get those morons out of my life.  I mean, who sits around all day on the PC and actually SEARCHES for signs on me on the web.  And they say I am psycho?  Maybe they should look in the mirror.

      Thursday, July 22, 2004 Hangover? Not me, Not today, but sooner or later......  How do I get over a hangover?   Ask an expert.By Sara Reistad-Long for Lifetimetv.com From Lifetimetv.com Rethink your drinks!      Q: Between work and family parties, I always wind up with hangovers. Is there a quickie remedy for recovering from drinking too much alcohol?   A: "Most experts think that a hangover is a mild form of alcohol withdrawal, which distresses the body, leads to dehydration and makes you feel awful," says Dr. Robert Swift, M.D., Ph.D., associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies. Below, we've compiled a list of foolproof tips to help ease you through that painful morning after:   Drink lots of water. Alcohol is a diuretic; it dehydrates our cells, causing us to feel tired, headachy and generally out of sorts. The sooner you can start replenishing your supply of H20, the faster you'll start to feel healthy again.  Get plenty of salt and potassium. Heavy drinking purges the body of these two important electrolytes, which together help transport and distribute nutrients and water throughout your body. To restock your body with these two essentials, try a sports drink (most contain ample amounts of both sodium and potassium), or eat a potassium-rich kiwi or banana and have a serving of broth made from bouillon cubes.   Fill up on fruit juice. Fruit sugar (fructose) is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, so any kind of juice will give your energy level a big boost -- fast. In addition, some studies have shown fructose to play a part in speeding up the rate at which the body eliminates toxins -- including those from alcohol. Orange and tomato juices are good bets, since both are also rich in nutrients such as vitamin C.  Don't forget your B and C vitamins. Supplies of these two are severely depleted when you drink -- thanks again to alcohol's diuretic effect -- so when you're consuming alcohol, your system needs these vitamins more than ever. There's no time like the morning after a big night out to load up on supplements. Better yet, get your dose naturally in a glass of fresh-squeezed fruit juice.  Caffeinate or pop a painkiller. Alcohol causes blood vessels to swell, which can also lead to serious head throbbing. Caffeine counteracts that, but since it's also a diuretic, limit yourself to just one cup of coffee. If that doesn't work, use ibuprofen, but skip aspirin -- it could help heal your pounding head, but this over-the-counter drug is known for wreaking havoc on a tender tummy.   Stick to light, low-fat foods. Because alcohol can upset your digestive system, it's important to line your stomach with food while you're drinking and the day after, too. Plus, a balanced meal will help restore your nutrient supply. Just remember: No matter how tempting it may be, steer clear of fatty and/or fried food the morning after, because it'll only make your stomach feel worse.  posted by NoShy1 @ 9:15 AM 0 comments   Wednesday, July 21, 2004 Hump Day!  If only I had the time or energy to get humped!   The attitude of some people around work here is disgusting. There is a particular person who just refuses to do her job, and acts holier than thou all day in the meantime. I am annoyed.   Goin' out with my fellow motocross chickie friends tonite. Big Bowl, here we come. We actually behave ourselves most of the time. Just dinner and gossip.   Rain, rain...where are you? Violent T-Storm watch today...but so far, no storms! It's hot as hell...over 90 degrees, and humid too! Rain, rain......where are you?  I am so boring sometimes.     Girls Lie Too Terri Clark  So she can’t go out tonight again  Her sister’s sick, she’s gotta baby-sit  Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse   Now you didn’t hear any of this from me  But things aren’t always what they seem  Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you   Girls lie, too  We don’t care how much money you make  What you drive or what you weigh  Size don’t matter anyway  Girls lie, too  Don’t think you’re the only ones  Who bend it, break it, stretch it some  We learn from you  Girls lie, too   We can’t wait to hear about your round of golf  We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall  And we like Hooter’s for their hotwings too  Other guys never cross our minds  We don’t wonder what it might be like  How could it be any better than it is with you   (Repeat Chorus)   Yeah, girls lie, too  We always forgive and forget  The cards and flowers you never sent  Will never be brought up again  Girls lie, too  Old gray sweatpants turn us on  We like your friends and we love your mom  And that's the truth  Girls lie, too  Yeah that’s the truth  Girls lie, too   No, we don’t care how much hair you have. Yeah, that looks good  Comb it over like that.  posted by NoShy1 @ 2:24 PM 0 comments   Tuesday, July 20, 2004 Fed to the lions....  Why are people so cruel? Why is it that some people truly enjoy hurting others? Like the Romans feeding Christians to the lions. Why do some people like to insult, degrade, and otherwise demean other people? Is it entertainment? Manly? Cool? Fun? Does the bully feel good about themselves? Something for Mom to be proud of? Does making someone cry earn you some sort of stripes or something? And if you don't know when to quit, and keep going and going and going with it.....do you get extra-credit? When are you the top bully...cooler and manlier than all? When someone gets hurt so badly that they do something drastic? Like jump off a building. Real fun games people play with others emotions, right? Fun, fun, fun. Very cool.  Don't get me wrong....some of this applies to me. But I am not suicidal. Just wondering what these fools might do if their constant and incessant insults caused someone to kill themselves. Would it feel good to have that on your head for the rest of your egotistical life? I don't understand bullies. I guess we never do...from childhood on to adulthood....a bully never grows up.   posted by NoShy1 @ 4:01 PM 0 comments   I don't want to work!  If only a millionaire would fall in love with me. I just hate getting up early, sitting in traffic for 40 minutes to travel 11 miles, and then eing ragged at by customers all day. I need a vacation, but have no vacation time to use. Sometimes, I swear I wish I would break a bone or something.....to get some time off. But......need the money. The bills don't pay themselves, and there are no millionaires in sight. Just Dougie - best friend, devoted to me, all around nice guy.   Going over to the parents house tonite. Picking some "hand me downs" up for Doug and his new condo.   Don't feel like doing much of anything. Wish I could sleep for 4 days. Ahhhh, that would be nice.     posted by NoShy1 @ 9:24 AM 0 comments   Monday, July 19, 2004 Another Monday.  I hate Mondays!  My favorite day of the week is Saturday.  You get to sleep late, and stay up late watching movies or bar hopping, then get to sleep in late again the next day.  Mondays suck.  I am so not a morning person, can you tell?  I could sleep until 3 pm daily if given the opportunity!      Went fishing on Sunday....first time in something like 20 years!!!!!!  (Am I getting old?  That doesn't sound so good, does it?)  I caught 8 Bluegills, and Doug....my in house fishing expert, only got 3!  What an ego buster for him.  Oh well....after all, they were just measly Bluegills.  Hey, at least I handled my own worms and took my own fish off the hooks!  Pretty good for a chick.      I wonder what fish do at night?  Do they sleep on the bottom of the lake?  Or just "rest"?  That would suck...not being able to really sleep.   I am glad I am not a fish, but sorry I am not a cat.  Housecats have the life - sleep, eat, shit.  Sleep, play, eat, sleep.  Shit, eat, sleep.  Sleep.  Get petted.  Sleep.  What a life!!!!     I am missing my buddy, Riley.  Even though I have a housecat, Pixie, I have a pseudo-pet in Georgia.  Riley is the only dog on the planet I am not deathly allergic to.   As a matter of fact, not allergic to at ALL!  She is the cutest thing in the world!  I miss you Riley!!!!       Enough ranting for today.  Back to the boring business of the daily grind.  Oh where, or where is Friday?  Or a long weekend?  Or a holiday?          posted by NoShy1 @ 10:38 AM 0 comments   Friday, July 16, 2004 UGH!  Some days are good, some suck!  This whole week has felt like it has lasted soooo long.  TGIF!  But, I just don't feel like work at all.  I don't know what else I feel like doing, but dealing with people, office politics, and paperwork just isn't part of my agenda today.  Not in the mood.     To top it all off, I have to go to a wake tonite for a former clients son...who I never liked.  He was a jerk for as long as I knew him.  His father is such a nice man though, so I have to go.    Just in a mood.     posted by NoShy1 @ 9:10 AM   Thursday, July 15, 2004 Something new.  I am really into that lately. My recent past:  3 years ago....decided to leave my lazy husband and mediocre marriage.  2+ years ago.....divorced and bought my own condo.  6 months ago.....got rid of abusive boyfriend.  2 months ago.....got ride of abusive, judgemental, so called friends.   Today......cancelled service to my website. Focusing on new things instead of the old. I ran the MX website for 6 years, but it's time to move on. Again...ridding myself of abusive and toxic persons....in real life and online.   So, here I am.....with this new project! Hope it hold my interest longer than most men. haha   posted by NoShy1 @ 3:08 PM 0 comments

      The Lake County Fair MX Race is keeping me busy this year.  Driving back and forth is a pain.....drive to work, drive home, drive to fair, drive home.....drive to work, drive home.......... UGH!  Well, today is the day!  My "After Party" is tonight, and lots of my friends are coming.  Should be good.  The band, Nuisance, is psyched.  I have some cool t-shirts, caps, etc. to giveaway too.  Very nice!   But I need sleep.  I am so tired, I don't know how I am even managing to stay on the road.  One more day.  Then, thankfully, I can sleep in tomorrow.  Saturday, helping Doug move is on the agenda.  I am going to be a zombie by Sunday night!  And then, the work week begins again.  I NEED A VACATION!  All the time!     urlLink Fair Info is Here!

      I hate them....but seem to always somehow run into them.  I just am too trusting and open hearted I guess.     urlLink Nasty Friends to Have!   Good article!    Let's take an inventory.... Amy was a double crosser, as was Denise.  (at least to some extent).  Ummm, they were both Disclosers - to each other.  Or, and they were Fault Finders too.   Sheri was The Competitor.    I guess I really did clean some serious house!  Thank God for my loving cousin Kim.  And my long distance friends Barb and Laurie.  And Rich and Craig.  And for my best friend Doug.  And my new friends Becky and Jinny.  Ah, the circle of life goes on.  The world keeps on spinning.

      Went out and had a little too much to drink on Saturday night.  Hung out with some of the boys...hadn't seen my friend Pilk in awhile.  I think it must have been the sheer variety of crap I drank that has me still feeling to ill.  Champagne, White Zin, Screwdrivers, a shot of Tequila, and a shot of Jaeger-Bomb!  Needless to say, I didn't sleep on Saturday night....too busy praying to the porceline god, and ripping the towel rack out of my wall in the process.  Oh yeah, and busting the toilet seat.  It was fun while it lasted!  lol    Busy week for me.....the big MX race and party I work on for months is this week.  Then, I have to help the love of my life/best friend move on the weekend.  UGH!  I need a vacation....seriously!  Or to win the lotto.  Or get a HUGE inheritance from some long, lost relative.  I want to be a lady of leisure.  Shopping and sitting on my ass all day long.  "A possibility was born the day you were born and it will live as long as you live." -Marcus Solero  Don't know who he is, but I LOVE the quote.   How can I still be suffering alcohol withdrawal symptoms 2 days later?!?!?!?!?!?!  My aching tummy!

      Thank you God!  Need a break!  It's nice and cool here.....upper 70's.  Good weekend for relaxing, sleeping, and some fishing.  Yep, gonna fish tomorrow.  It's sort of nerdy and gross, but I also sort of like it.  I can actually do it, catch fish, and it doesn't cost a lot.  I also don't get verbally abused by the fish....like I did with MX people.    Still decorating Doug's house.  Now we are moving on to furniture and a washer/dryer.  Thank goodness for him, I have done all of this before.  He is not very bright about these things.  Can't wait to have him settled, although it is fun spending his money.    I gotta wake to go to tonite.  It's for the mother of a woman I don't even like.  I hate that.  Why do I have to go?  Well, guess I don't....but Doug has to and so....along comes Shyla.  All I know is, I better get some major flowers soon - or a DIAMOND!

      Summer has flown by.  One day, during December, I will look back and wonder what happened to the summer of 2004?  What did I do?  I only have jet-skied once this season.  Haven't been to Six Flags.  Been to the pool about 3-4 times.  No real "vacation"....just a short trip to Atlanta.  My summer went to hell again.  Been so busy this week and last.  I need a break.  I worked on my Lake County Fair Motocross  After Party stuff like a maniac for the last week leading up to the event.  It was off wonderfully.....without problems like last year.  The band, Nuisance, kicked ass on stage.  WIIL Rock broadcasted on the radio live from the event.  I gave away all sorts of free stuff from Thor MX gear, SheRides.Net, and ProMotion.   Plus, the band gave away some CD's and the radio station gave away some Milwaukee Brewers tickets too.  It was sooo fun.  I even went "undie dipping" in the pool at the Days Inn at 2am!  What a blast.  Jumping over a fence with 3 guys?  Who could ask for more.  lol  Catching up with work.  I missed Friday and Monday....just getting caught up now.  Time flies when you are busting your ass.   Helped Doug move last weekend too.  I was so sore from climbing his stairs about 40 times!  I decorated the place pretty nicely.....very outdoorsly.  Doug likes that rustic stuff.  He still needs furniture though.  haha   I am sort of jealous......I wish I lived there.  Hopefully, one day I will.  But Doug seems to be in his own little world these days.  Don't see a proposal in sight....even though 2 months ago he would have killed for me to marry him.  UGH...I give up.    Gotta get back to work for now....it's never ending.  Thank God the weekend is here again after tomorrow!  Probably gonna go Blue Gill fishing again.  It's cooled off significantly...only in the 70's now.

      New books started last night:  1 "Bridget Jones Diary, The Edge Of Reason".  Better than the 1st book!  Can't wait to see the movie.    # of spiders killed in my house last night: 2 Big black ones....nasty!  Where the heck are they all coming from. My ultrasonic pest repeller isn't working so good on them.    Reasons I can think of to be at work today: 0  Fishing is tomorrow....gotta be up and at Winthrop Harbor by 5 am!  Plan on going home, grabbing my bag, zipping over to Dougs, and going right to sleep...If I can.  Sort of nervous...what if I catch something big and it's too much for me to handle reeling in?  I will look like an idiot!

      Don't ask me why....but I am in something of a "renewal" phase at this time in my life, I guess.  Decided that MX shouldn't be my whole life.  Needed something new.  So, as you know, started fishing.  This weekend, going out on a charter on Lake Michigan.  A friend of Doug's friend is the captian.  Should be fun, although I have been warned about taking Dramamine first.  I have never been sick on a boat on Lake Michigan....but then I have only really been out once before on a smaller boat.  I will get some Dramamine at lunchtime.  lol    Also, decided (on a whim) to learn to knit!!!!!  Thought it would be easy.  Spent over $40 on "stuff".....knitting needles, 2 starter kits, yarn, a tote bag, loom, etc.  I was impressed with my patience and perseverance....but I just don't get it.  I need to actually SEE someone knit I think.  Oh hell, if nothing else, I tried.  Maybe I will be making afghans one day.  No one does that anymore....why?  I miss my grandmas's afghans....even when they were made with ugly brown yarn.    Well, it's Wednesday.  And it's cold here....only 64 for a high today.  I hate super hot summers, but this is silly.   I will have to bundle up on the boat this weekend.  But, it's awesome sleeping weather and we know my fave pastime is napping.  Didn't want to get out of bed this morning....but, then again, when do I want to get out of bed to go to work?

      Nice weekend.....fished on Saturday and Sunday.  Caught lots of teeny, weeny Bluegills...and one Lake Perch. I guess my perch was pretty good looking for a Forest Preserve Lake too.  Got some sunburn as well.  I am soooo pale.  Used self-tanner all summer in the hopes of saving my already damaged skin.  I am going to be one of those women who has to look perfect and gorgeous until the day I die!  Better start doing something now.    Yum.....got myself a Long Grove Apple Pie.  I am eating it right out of the tin.  What a dream this pie is.  I don't even like apple pie....I am more of a Key Lime kinda chick.  But, this stuff!  Lots of butter and sugar in the crust!  To die for!   Got Doug pretty settled.  Thank goodnes.  Now we can start having some fun.  I hope.    Work is driving me mad.  I so wish I didn't have to work ever again.  I guess I have a terrible work ethic.  To top it off, if my co-workers aren't annoying me....then the claim reps are.  I lost an account because of some schmuck, and fully intend of giving him an earful!  Big time!  He's got another hour to call me, or I go over his head.  Feeling bitchy!  I am woman hear me roar!!!!

      Hours of sleep I got last night: 8, Number of times I have yawning this morning: 0.    WOW...what a difference a good night's sleep can make.  I really have to try to get my ass in bed earlier on a regular basis.  I was asleep by 10:30 last night....not my usual midnight or later thing.  I feel good today.  Amazing!   I forgot what this feels like.  As Doug is an "early to bed, early to rise" person as well, I better get into this habit now.    Dougs townhouse is coming along so nicely.  I just love him....don't really know why, but I do.  I really can't imagine myself without him, ever.  He's been hinting again about me .... moving in, wedding, etc.  Even though I like my freedom, and don't want to get carried away and rush into things, I want to do this.    Great movie of the week:  I Netflixed "13 going on 30"....what a great movie.  Too funny, and a tear jerked love story ending.  Tonight hope to finally get around to seeing "Seabiscuit".  I have to stop Netflixing movies that I don't really want to see, but feel like I "should" see.  I just can't get into watching them.

      My "Cousin Kim", just called.  She is actually my ex-husbands step cousin.  But, since she isn't "blood", she isn't good enough to be accepted by them.....unless they are looking for a gift evidently.  Kim and I are like Best Friends.  Anyway....she got her invitation to my ex-hubby and ex-best friend's wedding.  hahahahah  This gets good.  Bob and Jenny are getting married in Vegas (no biggie) but their reception is at Dave & Busters ---  urlLink www.daveandbusters.com.   Too funny....classy stuff, huh?!?!?  What will the older generations of guests do?  Play NASCAR video games all night?  I guess this is right up Bob's alley....juvenile.  For a guy who didn't want any kids, he sure is good at being one, and accepting Jenny's stupid one to boot.    Well, she wanted my life....and now she has got it.....borderline white trash.  Enjoy it Jen...you deserve it!

      Saturday was a drama, to say the least!  Woke up at 3 am, caught the Dirty Turtle charter at Winthrop Harbor at 5 am, got seasick by 6:30 am!  Stayed nauseous, despite 3 Dramamine, until around 10 am.  # of Salmon caught by me = 1 (7 lbs) # if Salmon caught on charter = 13.  Doug got a 20 lb one....it's at the taxidermist!  Cool.  Don't think I would ever do it again, but it was an experience to say the least.
