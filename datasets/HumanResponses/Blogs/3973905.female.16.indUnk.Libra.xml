       ok, for those of you that know my mother, you will understand this, for those of you that don't know her, you may learn to see how insane she really is. my mother, for the second year in a row, volunteered us to work the pro-life booth at the county fair. now, last year it wasn't all that bad, we worked and we went home after looking at some of the booths and colecting worthless crap. this year, i assumed it would be the same way, boy was i wrong. we got there and we had to work for four hours. so, after four hours i said 'mom, it's seven, can we go now' but no, she was convinced it wasn't seven yet. so, we waited, then she finally asked some one, about fifteen minutes later, what time it was. the person replied, quarter after seven. so, i had to be bored for fifteen extra minutes. no big deal. but, then my brother had to play some game and try to win some stupid stuffed animal. and of course, it was raining. so, we're standing in the fair while it's raining, and it's been raining since we arrived, so the ground is muddier than anything i've ever seen. now, i didn't know it was going to rain, so i had worn flip-flops, so of course, my feet were getting muddy and i was getting we, plus i was hungry. now, my brother lost this game he had to play, so he decided to try another one, which he also lost. if you ask me, he should have just taken the money and went to the store to buy the stuffed animal, then we wouldn't have had to sit there in the rain. so then, we decide it's time to go home. so, we're walking through the mud pit that was serving as the parking lot and my flip-flops decided to start sticking in the mud. my shoes must have gotten pulled off ten times during the walk from the fair to our car. so, we get in the car, my feet are muddier than they were before, my flip-flops are dirty, i'm tired, i'm wet(as in an, i was standing in the rain kind of way not in a messed up way that some ppl might take it), and i'm hungry. in the end, it was not a very good day at the fair.   thank you

       due to complaints i have recieved about my bitching about the dewey decimal system, i feel obligated to apoligize to the public to whome this reaches.  apparently some people *coughmandycough* feel the need to bitch at me about my bitching about my job becuase they don't have one.  However, what chippy failed to mention is that she hasn't put enough applications in at enough places to get hired.  now given in the end only one application will matter, the place that hires you, very few ppl know whick application that is until after they are hired, and she does not know, but still feels the need to bitch.  so, hence forth i apoligize for my previous comment about my job at the library and all the stupid things that i have to do that no one really cares about.   thank you

       alright, so i started my job yesterday.&nbsp; i'll admit it was fun, but i deff don't want to reshelve books at the library the rest of my life, but then again, who would.&nbsp; the only thing is, my legs are sore, i don't usually crouch down that much.&nbsp; i have a feeling that by the end of all this, i'm never gonna want to look at another number again, but then again, who understands the dewey decimal system.&nbsp; no one, you could put those books in any order you wanted and no one would care.&nbsp; you know what else no one prolly knows, if there's 20 books by the same author, the titles are in alphabetical order.&nbsp; who knew that?&nbsp; i think it's all just a waste of time, but that's just me who's going on like three hours of sleep and reshelving books for two days straight, so there you go.   thank you

       ok, my main reason for creating this blog was so that i could comment on my friend's.&nbsp; i never acctually planned on writing in it, but i got bored, so here we are.&nbsp; my boyfriend is in new york, so the phone has been unusually quiet for the last two days, but of course i miss him.&nbsp; i just wish my memory would decide to work so i could remember when he's coming back.&nbsp; oh well, i'm going to see the terminal with EP today, gotta love her, haven't seen her in a while, so it should be fun.&nbsp; thing is, bf wanted to take me to see, oh well, he missed his chance, it's his own fault.&nbsp; besides, i've seen movies with him and this one won't be in much longer.&nbsp; that's the extent of my life, isn't it interesting?&nbsp; not

       alright, so after my g-pa's party, i went home with my aunt and uncle (they're going to have a baby, yay).  in some strange series of events my uncle volunteered my aunt to give me a manicure, and then let me spend the night since he had to come out here for meetings the next day.  it was fun.  my aunt and i tortured my uncle and tried to think of names if the baby was girl.  they already have a boy's name, dominic, after my great-g-pa, but they're stuck on girl's names.  apparently my uncle doesn't like any of the names my aunt picks out, and he tries to think of the strangest names he can (this wouldn't suprise you if you knew my uncle), i feel sorry for the little girl.  i really hope they have a girl, just because we haven't had a lil girl in the family for around 12 years (i think), which i don't really remember.  i'm sick of the little boys, they're too hyper.  plus, i already decided if they have a girl, i'm moving, for one, i always wanted a lil sister, and for another, someone has to be there to torture my uncle after i leave for college, and the boys won't do it cuz they think he's too cool (don't get it and don't care to).  so, i got my manicure and then my uncle woke me up at like 7 in the morning, way too early when u stay up till 11.  but that's pretty much all that happened there.  i worked yesterday, nothing interesting there.  except, i do wonder when they're going to hire someone new.  one of the ppl quit, so they have to hire someone else, but i don't know when they're going to.  i guess i'll just have to wait and see, or i could ask chris, but i'll prolly forget to do that, damn memory.   thank you

       wow, i think my life is boring, acctually, i'm pretty sure it is. i am bored, once i again, i have to go to wirk in an hour and i don't really feel like it. not to say i dislike my job or i'm not grateful to have it, but i'm tired and cranky (damn period) and then i have to go work the festival right after i'm done at the library. i went back to school shopping for school supplies and i bought everything for under $20, except paper, i forgot to buy paper, somehow, i'm still trying to figure that one out. my alarm clock broke the other day, so when i went shopping with my mom yesterday, i got a new one. it was the cheapest one we could find, mom says i go through alarm clocks to fast, it's not my fault though, they just break, she's usually the one that buys them for me anyway. poing being, it has the most annoying tones, there's three, one sounds like a school bell, one sounds like church bells (the best one, but still annoying), and one sounds like a fog horn. why could she let me buy one that will wake me up with the radio, who cares if they're a lil more expensive? on a brighter note, i get paid today, i think. i'm going to the festival 2marrow to hang out and then on sunday it's my grandpa's b-day party, he just turned 90, horray for him. why is it that ur whole summer, save a few weeks, can be extremely boring and then at the end, you have so much to do, you don't have enough time? all i want to do is go to the zoo and see the baby rhino. wow, that must have been randome to you, one of the rhinos at the zoo had a baby, and i want to go see it, but mom says we prolly won't have time. we had time to go to the art museum, why can't we have time to go to the zoo? blah, i'm mad now.    thank you

       i think i might be broken.  i don't know what's wrong, but i can't feel happy.  not the way i used to.  i haven't been able to for a long time.  think i'm broken.  i already sound like a broken record.  maybe i'm just sick of all the same old stuff.  i need somthing new.  or maybe i'm just broken.  who knows?  someone fix me!!

       ok, u know your life is boring when your counting excitedly to the day school starts. i'm bored out of my mind. not really too much to do. last night my little brother had a sleep over for his birthday party. i think my mom is insane, she made goody bags for them and gave them fire crackers in the bags. not acctual light the fuse and they blow up fire crackers, but the ones that you pull the string and the make a loud noise and confetti comes out, and then a bunch of those little poppers that you throw down on the ground. we were listening to those for hours on end. then, they were up till two in the morning. now, given i could have gone to bed, but they were being loud, so i prolly wouldn't have gotten to sleep anyway, so i stayed up with my mom to keep her company. then i slept till noon today. now given, i did call friend last night to see if i could go stay with her so that i didn't have to put up with this, but she had to go to boyscout camp to visit her bf (yest he's still ing boyscouts, plz don't ask me why) and i would have loved to have gone with her, but she wouldn't let me. thnx alot friend. thank god i don't have to work today.   there is one thing i'm really looking forward to, and that's back to school shopping. i know i'm crazy, but i love back to school shopping, and i don't mean clothes shopping, i like shopping for pens and stuff. oh well, i know i'm weird.   thank you

       i just broke up with my boyfriend.  i don't like him that way, just as a friend.  but, why do i hate myself for it?  i mean, not to say that i really do want to go out with him, but i feel bad because i hate hurting ppl.  it sucks.  oh well, it's better than being stuck with someone i don't really like.  i guess that's just how it goes.
