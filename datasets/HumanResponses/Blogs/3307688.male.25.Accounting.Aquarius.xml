      When I wrote the title to this post I was thinking of the SNL skit where Jimmy Fallon is playing the disc jockey.  Well anyways, after a 5 day hiatus, I'm back.     Random Thoughts From My Trip   Well I was in Minnesota for the last few days, but not just Minnesota, I was in a small town in Minnesota.  You do not realize how long a day is until you have stayed in a small town in Minnesota.  It's pretty cool, you can be doing stuff all day and then realize it is only 1:30.  The sucky part was coming back to my city life here in Kansas.  My work has seemed really long over the last 2 days.  I am started to deal now and today has gone by much quicker.    Small prop planes suck.  2 words about Minnesota... Taco John's.  Best place to get tacos and tater tots.  Fishing with leaches, nasty.  Catching fish in Minnesota, cool.  -CO

      I have one question, why can't an airplane fly to a city you want without having to stop 1 or 2 times anymore.  Tomorrow I am flying up to Minnesota to see my best friend and at least in this case I can understand having to stop in Minneapolis.  I am flying to a smaller city named Bimidji and I am pretty sure that they don't want a big jet landing in their airport.  That is why I get the pleasure of flying in a prop plane.  But back to my gripe, last August me and a buddy flew to Vegas.  So we were looking for a flight online, some of the flights had us heading to Memphis first, which is east of us and then going to Vegas.  The one we settled on stopped in Denver, which at least was going in the right direction.  I understand the cost of having direct flights all day would be expensive, but at least have a choice of one.  Even make it a little more expensive or something, I don't care, but if I am ready to party in Sin City, I don't want to have to sit in Denver International, which is a very nice airport, for two hours before I can fly and get drunk and broke.  The only way we made up for having to wait in Denver, is that we found a bar and got pretty sh*tfaced before getting back on the plane.  Talking about getting drunk in an airport reminds me of a story about my dad.  My last name is O'Hare and my dad was just getting back from Vietnam and had to stop in O'Hare Airport in Chicago.  My dad goes to the bar and orders a beer, the bartender notices dads uniform says O'Hare on it, so he ask my dad if he is related to the guy the airport was named after.  My dad, with some fast thinking, says yeah he is my old man.  Bartender then tells my dad that his money is no good there and gives my dad free beers till his plane was ready to leave.  My dad said he was so drunk that he just passed out on the plane.  Now that is how you fly!  -CO

      I was surfing the internet last week and ended up looking at Slightly Stoopid's website, I was looking at their tour section to see if they were coming to KC anytime soon.  Well they weren't but I saw they were on tour right now with a band named Pepper.  So I go to Pepper's website to check them out.  They sounded like a cool band, so I ordered a couple of their CD's.  I have to say that I was very surprised.  For those who like Sublime, they are kind of a rougher version of them.  In fact the lead singer on some songs does a haunting impression of Brad Nowell.  I had to make sure it wasn't Brad on the song.  A little insight on the  band they are from Hawaii and have been around since the mid 90's.  They have a couple CD's out right now, but the two I bought were  Kona Town  and  In With the Old .   Kona Town  is probably the better CD, but on  In With the Old  they show off a more of their musical talent.  Their music is a mix of reggae, rock, country, and dance.  On  In With the Old  they have a song called Punk Rock Cowboy that is really funny and the music style goes from old style country on the verses to punk rock for the chorus    Their CD's have the same good time feeling as Sublime, without the dead lead singer thing.   RIP Brad .  For Slightly Stoopid or Sublime fans I would recommend buying the  Kona Town  CD.  Then if you buy them go out and buy some more of their CD's.  For more info go to  urlLink pepperlive.com  or  urlLink volcoment.com .  -CO

      It's a funny thing, the relationships between men and women.  I don't care if you are an ugly, big girl, there is some guy out there that will do anything you ask him to do, if you'll sleep with him.  We are so hormonal that we will go above and beyond normal thought, just for a chance, that's right a chance, to get some sex.  Best friends will blow off each other for a chick.  You'll lie to your parents to be with your chick.  You will be tempted to change stuff about yourself just to be with a chick.  Maybe that is why I am still single, I haven't met anyone yet that has made me want to change myself for her.  Or maybe I am just stronger willed then most of the men out there.  Whatever it is, I have watched a lot of my friends change over women.  Partiers become pussies.  Strong, independent men become whipped.  A scrubby looking guy can become yuppie like, just for a chick.  I admit it though, I have done some pretty dumb stuff to try to impress a girl.  I have bought CD's just because a girl I liked was into the band.  I have joined clubs and stuff in high school because a chick was in there.  I have blown off friends, so I thought I could look cooler, for a chick.  Do you know what I have realized in all this stuff though, every man will have many a chick in his life, but true friends, you will only have a few of them.  Don't f*ck them over just so you can score.  If it's love, that's cool, true friends will understand, but don't f*ck them over for sex.  I have already lost one good friend in my life to a chick, I just want to make sure others don't follow the same path.    Watch your d*ck.  -CO

      Just for the record, writing resumes suck.  There is a job in my group that they just created that pays much better than what I am currently doing.  So I figured I would give it a shot, the worse thing that can happen to me is that I don't get the job.  So here I am now, trying to update my resume and I starting thinking, this is only time in my life that I feel like a prostitute or a pimp.  It's like this, hey what you looking for man, oh some Excel skills, well I got the finest Excel skills you ever seen.  Have you seen Excel do this?  Yeah baby, I can do stuff with Excel that you can only dream about.  How much is it going to cost you?  Well how much you wanting to spend?  $30,000, you must be dreaming, you don't get Excel skills like this for $30,000.  It will cost you $50,000.  $40,000?  Well okay I'll take $40,000 but you better give me some good benefits or I will take my skills elsewhere.    For those of you just graduating college, welcome to Corporate America.  -CO

      I remember back to my early drinking days, when the smell and taste of beer was revolting to me.  Now I laugh at myself because if I go 4 or 5 days without a beer I get this mad, addict-like craving for a beer.  This isn't a crackhead addiction to alcohol but there is nothing out there, that is better at calming your nerves, without totaling f***ing you up, than a nice cold beer.  I can be pissed off, lonely, depressed, it doesn't matter, but if I go out to a bar and have a beer I feel so much better.  Recently my car broke down and it cost me $1400 to fix it.  Being the loose spending guy that I am, of course I didn't have the money to pay for the repairs.  So I ended up having to get a loan to pay for my car repairs.  Finally, I get my car back and I am both pissed off and depressed about my current situation, so I go to a local bar and get myself a few beers.  In about an hour and a half not only am I no longer pissed or depressed but I am happy.  I figured heck it is only like $60 a month, who cares, but then I thought what if the $60 comes out of my beer money?  Better order me another.  -CO

      Went to the 5th game of my 21 game season ticket plan with the Royals last night.  They won, 5 - 1.  Good game, but there was something I started noticing over the last few games that cracks me up at the ballpark.  When certain players come up to bat they, like a WWE wrestler, have a song that will play only for them when they come up to the plate.  Matt Stairs has, honestly, the Stone Cold Steve Austin song start playing.  The one where it is a guitar riff with some glass breaking in the background.  I don't know if the players pick the song or what but honestly what is next?  Is Mike Sweeney going to come out in purple spandex with a green mask.  If the pitcher hits him can he run out and perform a backbreaker on him?  "Now playing third base, the Ultimate Warrior!!"  Even funnier is the fact that some of the Latin players on the team come up to salsa music.  Yeah that's the stuff to pump me up, salsa.  My friend is Polish so if he becomes a Royal, would they start playing Polka music?  -CO

      One of my biggest questions about bands is why does a band have a really good CD or two and then try to totally change their style and expect their fans to still like them.  Case in point, Korn's first CD really heavy, really screamy, really good.  Second CD less heavy, less screamy, less good.  Third CD came out and it was more comercialized.  Still a CD that I enjoy, but they added the techno beats to their songs and became more of a singy band.  Fourth CD, what the f***!!  Fifth CD, what the f***!!  Wham, there it happens, I no longer look forward to Korn releasing a CD.  I finally bought there last CD a couple months ago and it was a little better than their fourth and fifth CD.    Here is my top 10 list of bands that first CD or first couple CD's were good but then they quickly went down hill.   Korn - see above  Limp Bizkit - 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll, really good heavy CD, then Fred Durst wants to try to sing, disaster strikes but they sell more money.  I guess they did it all for the money, the money, the money.  Then they lose the only person with musical talent in the band when Wes Borlen leaves.  Incubus - Probably not a popular choice with most people, but their best work was on their "S.C.I.E.N.C.E." CD.  Heavier CD with a lot more energy than anything they have done since.  Just to note though, I do like their other releases but major disappointment compared to "S.C.I.E.N.C.E.".  311 - Their CD with Down on it must have hit me at the right time, haven't really liked anything they have done since except a few songs off of "Transistor"  Coal Chamber - Their self-titled CD was awesome, then they come back with this awkward sounded second CD "Chamber Music", bad, just bad.  Third CD had a little more pop, but it was too late by then.  Soulfly - Their self-titled CD is probably one of my favorite metal CD's of all time.  Everything after that sounds like a water downed version of the same song.  Max needs to learn some new words or something.  Pantera - Ohhh, another band that I am going to diss that will anger the masses.  Don't make fun of the Kings or Rock.  I really liked "Great Southern Trend Kill" and "Far Beyond Drive" besides that all their songs sound the same.  If you really want to notice it stand all day in the song at Ozzfest and then listen to them play an hour set.  I kept asking my friends if this was a new song or the one they were just playing...  Disturbed - I'll pat myself on the back and let you know that I bought "The Sickness" about 3 months before most of you heard a song on the radio.  They were going to be on Ozzfest that year so I decided to buy their CD to check them out.  Wow, what a good CD, nice energy, nice music, and great vocals.  Second CD comes out and like Fred Durst all he wants to do is sing now.  Hey if it wasn't for you monkey call like screams on your first CD, you wouldn't have even had a chance to make the second one.  Wisen up, go back to the animal calls on your next CD.  Seven Mary Three - Wow, "American Standard" one of my all time top ten CD's.  Great songs like Margaret and Cumbersome.  Then they go on and release "Rock Crown", I tried to like the CD, listened to it for a month.  Couldn't do it, I think it has about 3 inches of dust on it now.  Don't know what they changed but it just wasn't the same, maybe it was the 311 factor and "American Standard" just hit me at the right time.  Hootie and the Blowfish - Alright, you're laughing now, but I really like "Cracked Rear View".  Catchy songs, fun music, great CD.  Than I bought "Fairweather Johnson" and the magic was gone.  I'll never love again...   I'll end it with some bands that their latest release is their best release.   Nothingface  Mudvayne  Spineshank  Ill Nino  Powerman 5000   -CO

      Today's music industry is not based on musical talent or musicians trying to do something different.  All it is based on now, is bands rehashing the same sounds that have been (unforunately) popular for the last 20 years and shooting multi-million dollar music videos.  If real musicians like Jimmy Hendrix, Brad Nowell, or Kurt Cobain were alive today they would walk onto the TRL stage with a firearm and open fire.  No real music lover would die, only boy band and Brittany Spear fans.  How can you call something music when you have someone, who doesn't even write their own lyrics, who is so bad at singing that you have to overlay their voice with heavy R & B beats to make it even bearable.  That's not music, heck I could sit at home with a keyboard, make a nice beat and sing to it and make a smash hit.  My only problem would be that I am not hot enough to make it very far with my lack of talent.  But I admit it though, I have caught myself singing along to Nsync's "Bye, Bye, Bye" or some other talentless band's song, the only difference with me though, is that you won't find that CD in my collection.    -CO

      Last night I engaged in a local free Texas Hold'em tournament.  First off I will say that I am not the best card player in the world, if I bet anything in a pot I want to win and it is hard for me to fold, anyone who knows anything about Texas Hold'em knows that this isn't a good problem to have.  For those who don't know, Texas Hold'em involves being dealt 2 cards and then you use the "community" 5 cards to make the best 5 card hand you can.  The "community" cards are just that, cards that anyone else at the table can use also.  Well you start by betting on just the 2 cards you have, then there is what is called the "flop" that is where the dealer puts down the first 3 of the "community" cards.  At this point you bet again, then the deal puts the 4th card out called the "turn", you bet and then the deal puts the 5th card, called the "river", out and you bet again.  So there is 4 rounds of betting, and if you are playing no limit like I was last night that means that anyone can raise the pot any amount they want.  You make a $100 bet the next person can call your bet and then raise it $10,000 if they want.  So like I was saying earlier my problem is that I would get to the "flop" have nothing but still play because I already had some of my money involved in the pot.  One more point you can fold your cards at any time, but the money you have already bet goes to the pot then.  So last night I played in 2 tournaments, the first one I was out in about 45 minutes, first one out at my table, but I had a good time and we decided to sign up for the 2nd tournament.  Now in the first one I realized it isn't a good idea to bet on every hand, it is alright to fold.  So in the second game I played a little smarter and ended up finishing 8th out of about 70 to 75 people.  Not bad for my first time, but I know of about 10 hands were I played stupidly.    No real point to this blog just wanted to talk about Texas Hold'em.

      I was thinking the other day about times in my life when there was something I really wanted to tell someone but worried too much about their reaction to what I wanted to say that I either wouldn't tell them or tell them so late that it didn't matter.  It is one of the things that I dislike about myself, the fact that I worry so much about other people's feelings that I don't deal with my own.  This is true when it comes to my friends, in my love life (or lack there of), and with my family.  I imagine most people see a girl in the bar they want to talk to probably think of something to say and then go over there and talk to her.  Oh no, not me, what I do is actually have the conversation in my head before I go and even talk to her and I end up shooting myself down.  It is sad, I know, and I have tried to get over it, but for some reason I am still hung up on that fact.  What ends up happening in my love life is that I meet someone in an easy situation (i.e. work, school, friend of a friend) and I become friends with them and then I end up falling for them.  I am a likeable guy (I guess) so I end up fighting my internal battle of should I tell them how I feel about them and risk losing them as a friend or keep it the way it is and be miserable.  I have been miserable for awhile now.  With friends it is a different situation.  If I think one of my friends is making the wrong decision, I want to help him but I also know that people don't really like being told what to do.  I know that they will eventually see the problem, but I don't want to see any of them get hurt trying to figure out what they should do.  The worse thing is when I do speak out and it is something I strongly believe they should do, they ignore me anyways, I just hope that when I am doing something that is stupid that they give me advice and I listen.  It is a strange phenomenon how we as people can get so blind believing that what we are doing is right that it takes awhile to see that it isn't.  They say love is blind, but I think all emotions are blind.  Word to the wise, listen to people who care for you, they're not trying to f*ck you over, they are really trying to help.  Listen before you waste too much of your life on a wrong decision.    -CO

      I have recently been getting into some of the really screamy bands, I don't know why but it just happened. One is Killswitch Engage, what can I saw but wow. This is probably one of the more talented bands I have listened to. The music is very good, all parts mesh well. The vocals are awesome, from a growling scream to a beautiful singing voice in an instant. It is crazy to listen to the lead singer in this band.   The band has many awesome songs on The End Of Heartache CD but Rose of Sharyn is definately my favorite.  One of the best choruses I have heard.  The other band is Alexisonfire. Strange band name and a strange band. The are pretty similar to Killswitch Engage except a little less talent on the music side but their singer(s?) are very good about mixing up the screams from the singing. It meshes very well and is a good buy for a band most people probably haven't even heard of.  If you want a more popular, radio friendly band Breaking Benjamin is phenomenal. I purchased there first CD Saturate because I thought their new single So Cold would be on it. Well it wasn't but Saturate is a very good CD. Then the next week I bought We Are Not Alone the CD that So Cold is on and this is probably one of the best CDs I have ever purchased. They have some softer songs and some pretty heavy songs. The lead singer has one of the most dynamic voices I have ever heard.  Well that is my thoughts on a couple of CDs I have bought semi recently.  -CO

      I was thinking earlier this week about other interesting work days there could be besides the standard and boring "casual Fridays". I put together a list of the top 5 best and worst specialty work days.   Best:   1. Bring your single, attractive, nympho, stripper friend to work day  2. Swimsuit day  3. Birthday suit day  4. Dress like your favorite pimp or ho day  5. BYOB day   Worst:   1. Make out with your boss day  2. Speedos and biker shorts day  3. "Golden Girl's" look-a-like day  4. Over 60 nude twister day  5. Bring your single, bald, fat, naked, white guy to work day  -CO

      Alright I have previously said that I had started dating a girl,well I have known her for almost 5 years and we just started dating. Well on our second date we went out to dinner and then saw a movie. Well when I took her home I was talking to her in the car when she went for a hug move, so I gave her a hug and she kind of gave me a funny look, said goodnight, and got out of the car and went inside. The whole time I drove home I was thinking about the look she gave me and maybe she was going for a kiss and I blew it. Well I was talking to a friend last night who's girlfriend is best friends with the girl I am dating, well he told me that she had called his girlfriend and was talking about how she thought I didn't like her because she went for a kiss and all I did was hug her. I thought this was pretty funny, but my thought at the time was why would she be going for a kiss on only the second date. I don't know if I am just strange that way but I wasn't expecting a kiss on the second date.  -CO

      Living in Kansas City, you have to put up with some bars serving absolutely fantastic beers and other places selling warm goat urine. I went to one such bar last night called The Speedway. Yeah the name just cries "white trash" and the people inside back up that statement. So I am there with my friend and they have a special on their "big draws" so I order a Budweiser and my friend orders a Bud Light. Well we get our beer and the Bud Light has no head what so ever and does not even have any bubbles in it, instant red flag for bad beer. Very, very flat beer my friend said. Well my Bud didn't taste too bad but it was never that cold to start with and it was a fairly large glass so the last half of it pretty much sucked. We ate dinner there and painfully chugged down one more beer but since the beer was horrible and I started to feel like I was at convention for plus sized women we decided to leave. I mean seriously I wanted to brand the women in there and lead them to a pasture to graze.  One question I always have, why do big girls insist on wearing clothing that is meant for girls with a nice body? Nobody wants to see their belly rolls hanging out under the skimpy tank top or their meaty arms hanging out from their shirt. I constantly go to bars and you will see some fine normal sized girl wearing an awesome skirt or pants and a little tank top and then you will look over and see a girl about 5 times bigger than the other girl wearing the same outfit. I am a big guy and I know that I wouldn't want to see some guy my size wearing a skin tight shirt and some leather pants. I don't want to look like Chris Farley in a Chippendale outfit, funny on TV not in real life.  My plea to the big girls of the world, please don't wear outfits wear the fat on your arms, belly, legs, or anywhere else is hanging out of your clothes. Remember fat rolls stay under the clothes. You know I love ya big girls, but you aren't going to attract me or any other guy when you're all hanging out.  -CO

      It has been some time now since I last posted in my blog. My how fast life changes. Well I am seeing a girl now and it is pretty cool, I am still in the whole feeling out stage of the relationship and since my experience with women is non-existent I am still very nervous when I go out. Also in this time period I have lost one of the most important people in my life. No it didn't happen because of him getting hit by a train or dying of some horrible disease that they would have to name after him, no it is a situation where we just grew apart, became different people, decided not to talk to each other anymore, something along those lines. Actually I haven't really changed since he moved away all those months ago, but he says he has changed a lot and instead of telling me about this he has to wait till I get so mad at him that I start sending him hatemail because he refused to call me or just didn't want to call me. I don't really want to lose a friend over something like this, but he acts like he doesn't even care, so why should I.  It gets kind of interesting in my life, when everyone I become really good friends with just all of a sudden screws me over for some reason or another. One wanted to act like a big shot and make everyone think that he had money and he ended up screwing me over when I was his roommate. Another, my cousin, got into drugs real bad and actually broke into my parents house, when I was living there, and stole multiple items including some of my money. Well he paid me back and we still talk every once in awhile, but he really has never apologized to me and it upsets me when I really start thinking about the whole thing. My latest screwing over, I'm not really sure the complete reason for it. It started out when he got a new girlfriend who he instantly feel in love with. Now I am cool with that, even though I am not the biggest fan of her, I would deal with it if it makes him happy. She lived in Minnesota and he just decided one day that he was going to move up there with her until she graduated from college. I told him that I thought it was kind of dumb to move up there for several reasons. One he had only known this girl for a couple of months. Two, he has never had any responsibility in his whole life, he had lived with his mom all throughout his high school and college days and never had a full time job, so adjusting to a new town on top of adjusting to being on his own for the first time didn't seem like the smartest idea. Lastly I had some selfish interest in it, he was my best friend and I really like hanging out with him, I didn't want him to go. Well he left and from that moment on, actually from about the time he told me he was leaving, I felt something different in our friendship. I don't know if he was pissed at me because I was doubting his decision or what but he didn't treat me the same from that time on.  When he moved up there, I had a deep down thought that I would never have the same relationship with him again, but I never knew how much I had understated that. First off he moved in late October or early November and I saw him once around Thanksgiving. Besides that I didn't talk to him once, he didn't call, he didn't email me, nothing. I sent him a gift for Christmas and I didn't even get a letter back then. Well then I emailed him just to make sure he got the gift and then he replied saying he did get it and he wrote a couple paragraphs about what had been going on in his life. Then no contact again for a month or so, I wrote him again and got a similar what has been going on in his life letter. Come April or May, he had a big fight with his girlfriend and out of the blue actually calls me, he complains about how controlling she is and how he thinks it is over and since he has no other reason to be up there that he might be moving back. Well as a friend I let him know that if he does want to move back and not want to live with his parents that he can crash at my house until he gets a job and maybe we find a 2 bedroom apartment somewhere. Kind of backtracking here, I had emailed him before and I had bought tickets to come visit him in May, so also in our lone phone conversation he joked about how I might be coming up to help him move more than anything else. I told him to take his time and maybe even talk about the situation with her before he made any decisions about ending it. Yeah I wanted him to move back and I kind of stressed how much fun it would be if he moved back and we moved in together, but I stressed most of all the fact that he should really think about it before he did anything.  Come May I go visit him. I spent about 5 days up there and had a good time, when is was jsut he two of us out it felt like old times, he was how I remembered and we had a good time. When it was me, him, and his girlfriend it was totally different. He was someone who resembled my friend but only mildly. He was less his fun normal self and more of this guy who was scared to do anything in front of her that might upset her. I instantly got a bad vibe off of her and tried to persuade him to spend as little time as possible with her while I was there, I failed. We proceded to spend 2 days at her parents house, which was in itself a strange experience because his girlfriend has a strange family in my eyes.  I wasn't raised in a relegious house and her parents were pretty religious.  I had said grace before Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner before but not before eating some hamburgers they had just bought at a resturant and brougth home.  Besides that, even if I was hanging out with him for the day he had to make constant calls to her to tell her what was going on and how much he missed her/loved her/wanted to make hot monkey sex with her. I had fun in big Minnesota but I was ready to leave when that day came, funny she didn't even meet us at the airport like she said she was going to when I left. Well my friend promised me that he would call and email more when I left. When I got back in town I called him to tell him that I had made it back in town, I got his answering machine and that was the last time I have heard his voice.  In June I send him an email seeing if he wanted to come to my parents lake house for the 4th of July since some of our other friends were going to be down there and it is a real good time down there. I also mentioned us trying to get a yearly trip together since we are all starting to move away. We were planning a Vegas trip in January. Well 4th of July comes and goes and I never got a reply to that email. Then I read my friends blog, that he had started right after his fight with his girlfriend, and learn news that you aren't suppose to learn about a best friend on the internet, he had proposed to his girlfriend. I was crushed, I was pissed, I was sad, all at once. I told some of my other friends about it and they had the same reaction that I did. I didn't know what to do so I waited a couple of weeks to hopefully hear something from him before I would contact him and go off on him.  A few weeks came and went so I wrote the hardest letter I had ever written, I ripped into him. Dropped a few f-bombs in the letter, more for shock value than actual feelings. Well I sent him this letter asking him to tell me that I was wrong for thinking he was an ass for not calling me for one about him proposing but more for not hardly calling me at all since he left. A couple of weeks went by without hearing from him, just some little hints in his blog post that seemed aimed at me, so I sent him another letter. In this letter I was more to the point and just said that if this is how you are going to treat me and make me feel than I am going to save myself the heartache and end the friendship. Next week, finally a reply letter and he rips into me for not changing and how he didn't want to tell me things because he knew I would tell him he is dumb for proposing and all this other garbage. The main thing from his letter that really got to me was the fact that it sounded like he didn't even know me. All the things he said about not being able to tell me things because he thought I would make fun of him was total BS. I am a guy who, if you tell me something I won't just take it, but I will question you on it and see if that is what you truly think or feel. I don't know if he was thinking he had to change for his girlfriend and thought being friends with me wouldn't allow that or if he just really has changed and in his change it meant getting rid of pretty much the only friend he has. I mean my friend has other friends, but he is like me, I have a lot of work friends, friends of friends, and friends similar to that, but it is really hard for me to get true friends, friends that I want to hang out with a lot and just call to BS to for no reason, and for him I was the only friend like that he had. I don't know his reasoning for doing what he has done but it hurts a lot and it made me say some stuff to him that I didn't ever want to have to say to him.  Sometime soon I am going to send another letter to my friend and I will take as long as I have to, to make it sound how I want. I have lost enough good friends in my life for stupid reasons and if I don't have to lose another one I don't want to. Maybe I will never be as close to him as we were, maybe we will talk once a year. I don't know, I just know that I will be the bigger man here, I will suck up the foolish man pride we all have and say that I don't want to lose his friendship. 20 years of friendship is hard to throw away on one stupid fight. It just still gets me that he is willing to throw away the 20 years for a girl he has none only for a little over a year. I guess love can do that, but if love is going to make me throw away everyone else I care about in this world, than you can keep love.  -CO
