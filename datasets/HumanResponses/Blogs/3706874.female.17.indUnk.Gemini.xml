      Ok, my friend emma here has seen about her and Tibs, but shes too LAZY to register so she can comment! lol talking about not bothering to get up off ur ARSE! lol  so here is the following message from emma::    *shocked and blushing* Jen how could you tell all about mine and Tibies affair, it was OUR little secret. I mean, I didn’t mind telling you cause I love my little fluffy buffy Tibies but I haven’t even told my parents yet, well probably due to the fact they have only seen the A-Team Picture of when he was about 2 a long time back and then they were slightly worried cause they thought  I was having convo’s with a Toddler on MSN.  Thank god I know he doesn’t look NOTHING like that minger Johnny Depp I can sleep easily now and have sweet dreams of my Tibies.  Kinky *lol* is NOT me, hes the KINKY one, talking about leather and fruit and well other x-rated things. He is so besotted with me, which is so cute, I have never felt this way about a BOY before. I cant say if your be needing to buy a new hat Jen, but WATCH THIS SPACE.;o)          Jen you know you are a TRUE friend to me, I remember the days, Jelly or was it Chickadee and Curly and our famous 13 page Birthday Thread. Everyday we would reply to that thread without fail, talking about our days, you baking deformed Ginger Men Biscuits from me having insane weird moments, which probably is no different than usual. And then the most hilarious thing about that thread was that the Birthday Girl in question was receiving Birthday wishes like nearly 2 months after her Birthday cause we kept bumping it.*lol*  Coming to see you soon will be your 17th Birthday to, :o) NO Guiness please Jen NO, I can still taste it now, whenever I have cream, that urghhhhhhhhhhh creamy stuff on top the guiness was go-grosssssssssssss. Me and Penny have a little performance for you, strictly ABOVE board, your love it. A little hint, Kylie and Jason. He, He, your NEVER get it.  I confuse the norma out of you sometimes on MSN, is soooooooooooo funny, theres me typing away like a secretary who is on her last dosage of speed, all proud of my reply and then you post: Emma what the hell you on about lol. Grrrrrrrrr.  Like I said before I love you *hey other people, no getting me and Jen confused there* shes not my type, her hair is to long would strangle me and her feet smell.;o)

      My friends  Ok, its half 11, and i am so unbelievably bored, so I tot id make a post here, i have decided to talk about ma mates.  Now, i have had many different friends throughout my life, but i could never really call one a *true* friend. They all started turning into bitches and so stuck up and i realllly do hate ppl like that, they began to think that they are better and above me and my other mates, which always pissed us off, its happened to this one girl recently, shes really pathetic, but i wont go into it now anyway. My school friends are really sweet and i do have a laugh with them and all, but do ya ever think that like something may be missing there?? like there mad and all, but i couldnt talk to them about anything, infact, i cant actually talk to anyone about anything, which is one freakin shame! lol I did have a friend for years called sarah, and we NEVER fought! we were so close, then she moved away, then moved outta the country! then one day she moved back abd visited me by surprise! that was when i was 13, and she has moved again, but stilll in Dublin, she doesnt have the same phone number and i dont have her addy, only she knows where i live, so its really upto her to track me down! lol  well, since i joined a michael jackson fanclub ive gotten to know sooooo many new ppl, its unbelievable. Its nearly my one year anniversary since i joined, yayyyy! lol The first friend i made was  Emma , she is just mad. She is sooo sweet, and i have seen her twice,one of the times she has been to see me in ireland for 5 days, she lives in Bristol and hes 25, the age gap makes absoulutly NO difference in our friendship, and she really has been a great friend to me in the last year, she was just the first friend i made off the MB,shes a great friend, but shame she lives so far away. But we always txt, email and msn, we talk so much crap, yayyy its so much fun!!! lol   Donna : Now theres one cool girl. I met her off MJNI aswell, shes 15 and she lives in Dublin, i was shocked to find out that there was a girl around my age living in Dublin that actually loves Michael like i do, i was so like, wooooooo! lol We exchanged numbers and we are ALWAYS txtin crap to eachother!! lol and we actually do have loads in common, we seem to have the same taste in films and yummy actors, like Johnny depp!!! mmmmmmmmmmmm Donna is so mad, and she is actually a really good friend of mine, we dont go to the same school or anythin, and we live like, hmmmmmm kinda a bit away, like it would have to be by car, but weve met up in a town a good few times, and shes just lovely. In the last year, i have began to realise the importance of friendship, i think its important that everyone has friends, friends that they share something in common with. I mean, i love my school friends but none of them like love Michael like i do at ALL, but i do have a lot in Common with emma and donna, so if yas are reading this, I LUV YAS!! xxxx I just hope theres no hidden dark evil stuck up sides to u both!! lmao  also off the MB, hmmmm.....ok theres so many cool ppl off there!!  Ste,  who is so MAD and so groooooovvvvy!! Stes the best  Steph,  is soooooo sweeeeeeet, seeing her in July for first time, shes a great singer and who couldnt love her!!  Sarah-  so cool and sweet and also a Johnny depp fan, the girl has taste! lol  Cat  - only just gettin to know her, she is one sweet mad girl!  Tom  - Tom is so sweet and soooooo funny!! coughhesinlovewithBMcough* jk!lol  Jane/ tinkerbell  - aw my tinky winky lol shes so wuvly  Tibsy  - ive known him for ages, hes one coool guy  Charis  - is soooooooo sweet and just gorgeous!  Jodie  - Ah Jodie is sooo cool!! such a lovveelllly girl!  Kev  - ah my kevvy baby hes one sweet guy, we need more guys like him!  Mel  - ah crazy mel! gold pants mel! lol shes crazy!  Jillie  - Jillie, the MB queen! dont know how she does it, but shes so lovely and kind and soo sweet  John  - Who also lives in Dublin, he is realllly nice, but havent spoken to him that many times, but hes cool! dam i know theres more! I just tot id really write about Emma and Donna, cause they do mean a lot to me, i LOVE to waste my credit on them! how fun! lol  ok, ill be off now...la la laaaaaaa

      &nbsp; I have less than a year, to prepare for my exams.....get into college...and if i dont get into my college, im screwed. I HATE the irish education system,it just puts a lotta stress on young ppl,like we dont have enough of it already. I dont know how my sister managed,shes sucessful of gettin into her college,she got 550 points in her leavin and ALL she did was study in her final year of school, i cannot do that,&nbsp; I have No will power.` This also means Im gonna lose contact with my friends here, I wont be online as much,which sux. all ill be doin is studyin,not exactly how I would like to spend my year of being 17. If i dont get my grades and points next year, Ill ave to repeat,thats the only option I can think of,its too much stress for me, I cant take it anymore, i dont wana go back to school in september,thats when its all gonna start.............  SIGH...............................................

MY PLANS FOR TODAY.................................................................................NOTHING!! haha I just realised,my mate txt me last sunday to do somethin with her on monday,I never txt her bac!! oooooopppppssss

      &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I have to decide SOON what im gonna do with the rest of my life....oh no,not a big decision at all!! infact,the next school year will be my last,and the most important year of my life.I have some ideas but Im still not sure and I dont want to make a big mistake in the courses and careers that i choose.   I would LOVE to be an actress, that was my childhood dream, whereeas as I got older,I came to realise how low the possibility of becoming rich and famous is lol   But i wont give up my dream, I mean, my bro and i have signed up to be movie extras, thats where everyone starts! and believe it or not,its easy enough to find an agent,whether u getta good job or not, is a different story. You may all think Im daft with this whole idea, I mean, obviously, im gonna do my leaving cert and my exams, and go onto college for somehtin,but no harm in joining film extras at the same time! see where it takes me! ya never know,maybe one day,ill be rich and famous, I can always dream, but I might as least TRY somethin!! lol   But next year in school i REALLY gotta study,it scares the SHIT outta me, knowing that this time,next year, i woulda done my leaving, the irish education system is unreal, SO different to the english and all them, we have it HARD, im tellin ya, its hell and stressing and no teenager should ever have to go thru it!! but...its all part of life, and if i achieve good grades, i go onto do better things in life..and not working in a lil shop or somethin for the rest of my life, I really want to achieve somehtin in my life, and have a good career, and this whole next year determines all oof that, no pressure no pressure lol   So i dont have enuf time to decide on college courses, but unfortunatly, its somethin I have to do and decide quickly, maybe if the whole acting thing works out, i wont have to worry about college, but I still want to achieve a good leaving cert, no matter what   well, big brothers on ina mo, and i cant miss that!! lol  &nbsp;

      Its really quite crap to be honest,im getting so used to her being around.And with my friends here at home,I dont laugh with them as much as I laugh with Emma.Now its 3:30 in the morning,and I know emma will soon see this,and for all I know,due to my lack of sleep,I could say things Ill regret laterzz hahahaaa Anyways,Its gonna feel weird not having her around anymore,Next time I see her will prob b nxt month for her bday,but even thats only a day! and after tht,cant see her till like next summer,but I wont get into that now,as thatll just get me depressed *lol*  By looking back at our piccies,I can tell weve hada right laugh,and a week sounded like so long,but its gone just wayyyy too fast.Time flies when ur having fun!lol If only she was here for 2 weeks.....*lol* its amazing what good friends u can make thru fanclubs etc.I would normally have never trusted anyone over the net.and Im still careful,but thru a michael jackson fanclub,u couldnt ask for closer fans and nicer ppl,well the majority of em anyways lol I never knew I could make such a good friend thru there,and Ive made many more aswell,but Ill always remember over a year ago emma....when I made that thread to u...and thats when it all started.....*lol*  Anyways emma,when u see this,just to let u know, I hada ball,and its been so much fun and too much laughing!! haha Luv ya  Jen xxxxxxx

      Wooo emmas here,she came on Monday...but sadly....she is leaving in 2 days!! :o( The time has FLEW by but its been mad aswell!! We have been into town to do some shopping,although emma didnt find any clothes that took her fancy!! But we bought COOL Irish hats!! Theyre mad lookin,but cooooool :o)  On wednesday,we went into town to go on this Viking Ship thing,it drove us around the city to give us a tour,and it also went into the water aswell! anyway,its covered,but the back isnt,and theres 4 seats in the back! now,when we were getting on,silly emma made the mistake of telling me to sit at the BACK!!We tot it would be fun,little did we know that it was going to literally LASH down with Rain!!! First,we had to wear these HUGE raincoat things,it was like a big sheet,in that nylon {w/e it is} material,with this lil gap in the centre to put ur head through,if u get me lol THEN when we had to put on lifejackets cause the it was gonna turn into a boat and go in the water!!The lifejackets were huge,and because of emmas huge boffhead *lol* the back of her lifejacket wouldnt go down,so behind her head,it went UP!! So try and picture that,as its SO hard to describe,but I can visualise it myself,and thats all that matters!! And Emma,that image will stay with me forever!lmao ill always remember how sexxxxy u looked!! lmao Anyways,we were getting laughed at by most people on the thing,there was one guy across from us,but He didnt look as ridiculous as we did!! and my trousers were literally soaked through!!I was SO WET!! *lol* People in the front there were complaining of lil bits of rain coming in on them,then the tour woman was like " u think uve got it bad,just look at the back" haha It just HAD to rain when we got on!! geeeeeeeeeees was mad funny though!!lol  Anyways,we did nothing on the thursday cause we got like NO sleep!! we were like on the net most of the day,was fucking hilarious. Yesterday,we went to Bray,on Dublins seaside,the weather was GORGEOUS,was so hot!!We had somethin to eat,went into this amusements place,with bumper cars and all that,was funnn! But the journey home....my god.We had to get 2 trains,the first one was fine,but the second one....emma was really not feeling well *personal reasons folks* and she started to lose her vision and she looked sooo bad,I got so fucking worried,had to ring my dad to ask him to collect us from the train station.And I was standing there,waiting till our stop,worried out of my fucking mind about her,as that was the first time ive ever been in a situation like that,it was awful!! but she was fine as soon as she got home and all that,just dont EVER do that to me again emma!!! lol Im glad I was there to help you though! :o) Today,we hada BBQ,was fun fun fun!!!lol Tomorrow,I think were going into town to get the photos done! yaynesss! Weve been on MSN till like 5 in the morning nearly every day shes been here!! which is normal for me,but not for dear emma!! shes used to her 12:30 bedtime,but she so LOVES stayin up that late with me!! its fun cause Im in the same room as her,and were usually ina convo with Tom,or ste,and tonight,cat aswell,its gas.and weve borrowed a webcam,and Ive put it on for other people so they can see her on the other comp,and she had no idea! i did it to her like 3 times!! lmao but today.....she got me back.did it to me twice,that bitch!! lol was funny though lol  God its so weird,cause a year ago I was jus talkin to her in threads on MJNI,now this is her second visit here,and we know eachother so well! its soo cool  anyway,tonights emmas last "all nighter" but its been so much fun,but is going too fast! ahhhhhhhh
