        Well today was a very good day. I helped with VBS...4 year olds...yeah i won't say anything more. They are all sooo cute...but at that age they don't know how to sit still or be quiet with someone else is talking. Yep its me and tyler in there helping...aww he will be a good dad someday...awww hahaha. But they are alot of fun don't get me wrong...just im tired every single day after VBS...how will i survive when im like 25 with kids all day long...hmmm....oh well not the time to think about that. Today I also went with my friends Amory and Blake and Tyler to her uncle's church...it was really nice...we heard Megan from Casting Crowns speak she was really really good...I enjoyed that. And here i am now...tired but still writing this...thats why it might be alittle weird...but neways...i think thas all i have to say today. Goodnight.

      Wow what could be better than going to the lake your last weekend of summer before school starts?  Well we left Wednesday night after church...i was sooo excited to go but we got there pretty late...and we all tried to go to sleep but me and Amory probably stayed up for an hour or two talking.  She was my roomate...good roomate too...haha.  Then the next day it rained which was kinda bad but we did get in the lake and Tyler and Blake kneeboarded.  Tyler kinda hurt his knee but its all gewd now.  So we had fun that day despite the weather.  The next day it was beautiful sun shinning...got alittle tan...hehe.  Later that night Me and Tyler, Blake and Amory went to get something to eat at this place on the lake...it was pretty good.  Well we came back...and we notice the Jet Ski was GONE...so we ran up to the house and walked in and our parents were acting all weird so we thought they took it out or something to teach us a lesson or something...so we ran back to the dock and got in the boat and went looking for the jet ski...we didn't see it anywhere...haha we looked like a search party...well we were but thats beside the point...so then Tyler's parents went looking for it too...we found a cop and told him and he reported it and all that jazz...then our boat ran outta gas...haha so they had to pull us home.  And that night was the BEST...we all sat on the boat joking around and acting sooo silly...i think it was the moon...which was the most beautiful moon i've ever seen and the best company ever made.  Then we went back up to the house and Blake went to sleep.  Me, Tyler and Amory played Uno...the game lasted for an hour and 35 mins...longest uno game EVER...I think Me and Amory were wayyyyyy to sleepy high...haha it was great...everything was funny that shouldn't have even been funny.  Then we all crashed and went to sleep...the next morning we found the jet ski woohooo...and came home.  Best weekend EVER.

       Bethany Dillon is embracing her story with purpose and vision. â€œGod is teaching me that it's not about me. I need to be faithful, and He will speak through me. I'm not going to worry so much about being successful or relevant." She goes on: "I want to awaken in my generation something that's been dead. I want to make the Word flesh and blood for my generation, to show them that living out the Gospel is something greater and more mysterious, with more adventures than we've learned." She strives to unearth what has yet to be unearthed.

       With special guest David Crowder Band...ahhhhh...David Crowder is like the best artist in christian music in my opinion...and he is a special guest...gee golly. Hey im not complaining though...i got to hear him...which was soooooo awesome. Mercy Me was really good too...but Micheal W. Smith...maybe its just because im young and don't like his type of music...but i guess it was ok...sorry. But that night was probably the most fun ive had all summer. I hadn't ever hung out with the older youth...they are very very fun. It was me Tyler, Nick, Jana, Jakob, Alicia, Shelly, and Craig, fun fun times. I was sooo tired this morning though...cuz i went to bed at 3:30 and had to get up at like 8:00...ok yeah yeah i got 4 hours...but that not enough for the cranky melinda...she gets cranky without atleast 6 hours of sleep. But she has gone away now...thank goodness. Well im out now. See you guys later.

       Thursday nothing really happened whatsoever until bible study. We are doing a bible study on the book "It's not about me". I really enjoy reading and studying that book. If you haven't read it and like to read...I would suggest that...its not just a book to occupy your time, it also is a learing experience in the making. Some of the things might go over your head in the beginning but they all tie together. Yes I have been reading that book instead of my summer reading...but im sure the book is a million times better than my summer reading books...and im getting way more outta the book than i would get out of "As I Lay Dieing" I mean come on...that book will probably make you wish you were dead instead of reading it. After bible study was over Tyler came over...i hadn't spent time with him in a while...so i really enjoyed that. And that is about all that happened on my eventful Thursday.

       Well my day started with taking my mom to the doctor to have surgery on her ankle. The surgery went very well and will hopefully heal quickly...keep her in your prayers. I didn't know if I was gonna stay for the lock-in or not...but im glad I did. We had alot of fun...from relay races to eating creamed spinch baby food...ugh. I did get pretty sleepy towards the end and I would have done anything (even ate vienna sauage) to go to sleep. I got home at 7:00 am and slept until 2:30 pm...I sure did get alot of sleep.

       Sorry i haven't updated in a while...but ive been pretty busy. I was supposed to be in Kentucky...but our trip got cut short because my mom broke her ankle. So we had to come back home and thanks to Tyler and Jan we got home safe. Ive been pretty bored besides that eventful day. I went to Stone Mountain with some friends on Saturday without Tyler cuz he was at the lake...i was pretty sad the whole time...so that wasn't good...but the laser show was awesome and so were the fireworks. Today i went to bible study which lifted my spirits and Tyler came home from the lake so that just made the day alll the better...i missed him alot. Well i better go now im hungry cuz i haven't had supper and its 11:00. I'll update again soon i promise.
