      I'm a "metal head" now... lol, well, I just got my eyebrow pierced today. It didn't really hurt, and 3.5 hours later, it still doesn't. It looks great too. I love it. I hope it doesn't get rejected. &nbsp; I haven't had much time on the computer these past days, and on Thursday morning I'll be going camping for at least four days. I should be back on the computer a lot again afterwards, because I'll have nothing else to do really. I'm sick right now though, so I'm going to sleep. G'night.

      lol, so I'm having a little bit of trouble with my computer right now. I just reformatted it and I'm finishing reinstalling everything I lost. I should have it finished by tomorrow, or today, if you count the fact that it's 4:35 in the morning.  &nbsp;  I'm about to pass out. I had a very long day. I fell asleep at about 10:00 PM after watching Adam Sandler's "50 First Dates" with my parents, and then woke up at 2:00 AM from a really horrible "nightmare", lol. It all started with the nightmare I had back in the old days, when I was a very small child. I had this dream that I was standing by the front door at my grandparent's house. The main door was wide open, but the screen door was shut, and the moonlight was shining on the white ceramic tiles. There was this silver box sitting on the floor, and I bent down to see what was inside it. I opened it and the inside was made of crimson velvet. Well, all of&nbsp;a sudden a hand comes out and starts pulling me in. At the same time, the bottom opened up and it was like a portal to hell or something. All I remember seeing is red, swirling mist.  &nbsp;  lol, yes, that was the exact dream. It might seem lame, but at the time, it was emotionally destructive. Also, it stopped me from getting up in the middle of the night ever again. Sometimes I have the same dream, but within another dream. I dream that I'm having that dream again. Recently, I've dreamt&nbsp;a similar dream;&nbsp;everything is the same, except for the box. There is no box, just voices.&nbsp;It's really eerie. I don't know if I believe in what dreams mean, but I'm kind of interested in hearing what a professional would say about it.  &nbsp;  Anyways, after waking up from that, I discovered that my sister had woken up too, so we watched "50 First Dates" again. A sad, but good movie.  &nbsp; Right now I'm listening to  urlLink "I Remember You"&nbsp;by Skid Row .&nbsp;Right now it's one of my favorite songs. I'm just going to put in on repeat and then go to sleep.  &nbsp;  Okay, there isn't anything to do. Only the internet seems to be working. I can't get any programs to work, not even MSN. I'll figure that out tomorrow.

      Yep.  I just finished playing Freelancer... and it was very intense. I'm so tired, and my hand is kind of frozen in one position, like it's cupped around the mouse permanently, lol. I was in a very INTENSE battle that took like forever, but I defeated my enemies and brought back a whole 1000 dollars. Well, that's a small amount, but I worked so hard for it *tears*  I joined the Liberty Navy.   The thing is, I joined a mod they're beta testing, and you can't play anything else except that once you install the mod software. It's TOTAL WAR. That means, if you die, you die and you have to start a new character all over again. lol. That hasn't happened to me yet, and it probably will sometime, and I predict that I will have an angry fit.   I just started playing and I'm pretty far. I had to collect 300 000 dollars to join one of the guilds... and you HAVE to join one of them. You gain about 5000 dollars a mission, so it takes a while. Fortunately, I play with my dad and he kept giving me tons of money... 40 000 dollars at a time. I'm so lazy. lol.  So what takes some people a few hours only took me 45 minutes. I tried playing alone and I hardly get any money. He must have some secrets. The thing is with that server, they're really strict. If you press F1 and exit the game if not docked, or when in space, you get banned, because it's considered a cheat. If you're in a battle, you can exit and come back and the enemies will be gone. So yes, it's cheating. You can use it while docked though.  It's like intense training for n00bs... and yes, I am a noob. It even says that right next to my name in brackets... [n00b]. I feel so special.   Well, it's time to go to sleep now... My attempts at downloading V:TM failed. Goddamn. Night!

      Yes, yes it is... and a very boring one at that.  My dad just came over... he brought over Freelancer, so I can play it now. I play the  urlLink IONCROSS Freelancer Mod . It's quite tough, because if you die, you die permanently. You have to start all over again. So that sucks. lol. Especially for me, when I'm just learning. I've never played this before... and starting out with Total War is tough. lol. Well, it's intense training for beginners. There will be no screwing around I guess. Oh, and I see that my dad's online now too. I'm going to play now. See if I can kick his ass. *crosses fingers*

      So, my dad gave me his N64. I was supposed to get Perfect Dark with it too, but that's no where to be found. Oh well, I have DUKE NUKEM 64, YEAH! Just wait until I get Goldeneye 007. I own at Turok 2 as well.   Eventually my brothers will be too afraid to play with me. Muah.  That is the end of that though. Post more later.

      Ah, okay, somehow all that midnight cheer just drifted away. I think I should go to sleep soon.  I'm listening to Depeche Mode right now... The music I listen to seems to affect my mood.  Depeche Mode - depressing Nirvana - apathetic The Cure - hopeful The Smashing Pumpkins - sad Twisted Sister - rebelious Britney Spears - suicidal Great Big Sea - happy Duran Duran - howly The Beastie Boys - gangsta The Beatles - like a walrus The Ramones - punk Cake - murderous (can't figure this one out myself)  Well, those moods don't always apply. When I'm really happy, nothing will break the energy.   I've switched to Sheryl Crow and now I feel vampiric. lol. I'm a vampire >> ^w^   Sleepy time!  ...I don't really listen to Britney Spears.

      Why does my birthday have to be in September? Goddamn, I'm supposed to be 17!  On a greener note, I took this test:   urlLink      urlLink Which Family Guy character are you?    In all honesty... I am so deliciously evil.  This calls for a sexy party!

      So, I got up pretty late today. Still laying in bed at 6:30 in the afternoon. I'm up now, but goddamn, 6:30 in the afternoon? That's late. I was laying in bed, wishing I had the strength to get up. If Spiderman could do it though, so could I... because I am so much stronger than Spiderman. Got that? Good, I'm glad we had this conversation.   So I envisioned myself moving the pillow that I was holding onto and getting off the bed. I burst with energy and threw the pillow behind me. I leaned back... and oh no, I was leaning on the pillow. It was so goddamn comfortable. Can't leave... comfortable... pillowy softness... heaven. So I layed there for a few minutes more and then got up without any thought.   I looked down, right, and I hadn't any "clothes" on. Well, pyjamas, but they don't count. The Sandman made pyjamas. Why do you think you go to sleep shortly after you put them on? It's an evil spell! Your bodily functions are slowed down and you are reduced to a motionless state. The Sandman can now rummage through your stuff and play strip poker with your mom. You will wake up and never know what happened, because your mind was in a whole other place! What an evil trick!   So I went rummaging through my dresser drawers. I found an orange t-shirt and a pair of black jeans. Orange and black, my favorite colors, aside from blue.  Life is good.

      I was just trying to squish a mosquito who was trying to steal my blood (my cache of deliciousness) and I hit the creature with my sketch book. I looked on the back of the book and there was this horrible bloody mess. I was shocked that a small creature could leave behind so many entrails. Well, it turns out that it was only jam (don't ask). I hit the thing a second time and hurrah, the beast has been slain! I was disappointed at the scene though. I was expecting some sort of massacre... but no, just a very small body, free of its mind and limbs.   Gawd.

        I dream about how it's going to end Approaching me quickly. Leaving a life of fear, I only want my mind to be clear. People making fun of me, For no reason but jealousy. I fantasize about my death, I'll kill myself from holding my breath. My suicidal dream, Voices telling me what to do. My suicidal dream, I'm sure you will get your's too. Help me, comfort me, stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now. The rope is here, now I'll find a use. I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose.  Dreamin' about my death, dream... Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
