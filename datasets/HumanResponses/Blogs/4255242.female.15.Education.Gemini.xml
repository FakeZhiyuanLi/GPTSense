      Damn it, I hate when I can have a nice day and everything goes all downhill. And it happens so very often. Nerrr.   Otogi x Noa: (. . .;.; ) Otogi x Noa: (Rizuchan?) Sign 0f The Ram: (Er, gomen.) Sign 0f The Ram: (The flurry of AIMs was a little late, but it's here now.) Otogi x Noa: (Oh.)   I got one post out of her. Oh, but, Delle got to sign on for a bit and she posted. :3 Which I'm quite happy about. The girl can get CHUNKS RIPPED FROM HER BODY and still care about me.   Otogi x Noa: (You hid my IM behind all of these other windows and forgot it was there.) Sign 0f The Ram: (Oh. Nope. I hate doing that, because I forget about it and can't tell where the beeps are coming from.)   You'd expect something along the lines of: "Oh, no, because that's really mean and you're my friend. I wouldn't do that to you. I've never gotten one of those from all of these people. Something just as simple as: "No, you're my friend."   Otogi x Noa: (Hee.)   You see that? I'm really surprised you can't tell that behind that little fucking fake giggle, I was REALLY thinking: "So glad my friends care."   Otogi x Noa: (Are you going to post?) Sign 0f The Ram: (Eventually.)   Eventually, because, you know, ALL of these OTHER people and friends from my NEW school are so much more important for me to talk to, you know. I don't get it. Something as simple as paying attention to me to, noticing me too.  It's been a long long time since I mentioned I was upset, and out of every friend I know, none of them piped up with a: "Hey, I wish I could make you feel better." or "Don't worry, we're here for you to talk to."  There is no fucking emotion in that god damned group, save for Katie, who is currently off in Chicago. No one who cares for another friend of ours. I bet you ANYTHING that they even reply to Lee's entries. And Kris's entries.  Please tell me, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I just that much of a burden for you to try and help just once? I can't see it. I tell them that I don't like being sad because I always feel like I'm doing it to get attention, but I do it like. . . once out of twenty entries. I am never usually sad. And when I'm sad, I AM FUCKING SAD. I don't let small things take me down, so I'm not often in such an angsty mood.  I want someone to care. Someone, that says they're my friend, to care. Someone that could give one fuck out of a million that I'm not actin' too hot.  Teenagers are too wrapped up in themselves, I know. I just fucking proved it. But I have some reason.  Huh, Santa? Huh, Kris? Rizuchan? Where the fuck are you when I'm alone? Scared, or hurt? Where the FUCK are you?  I'm too angry to deal right now.

      Rizuchan is role playing with me. Well, she agreed to, but has yet to actually post, and I am slightly doubtful that she actually will. x.o I wrote a letter to both Liz and Alicia, and I sent Liz the little present that I'd wanted to give her when I met her, and now I'm quite sure that's not going to happen. -___-' So today was spent playing seven hours of Kingdom Hearts, and eating McDonald's, learning some bad news,  and the rest kinda sucked. RIZUCHAN POSTED. Huzzah! ::runs in circles:: ::responds to her post:: >>

      I love how I can be horridly upset, and no one cares. I don't even complain that much, give me some FUCKING CARING SOMETIMES. I care when you guys are upset, don't I? I try my best to make you feel better. And my world crashes around me, and I'm the only person left out. The only person that no one gives a fuck about. . . .I'm glad only Anne knows about this journal, because most of this is most likely going to be crap that only she should know about anyways.

      I think the one way that you know you truely love someone, is when you're afraid to tell that person that you love them. And you can't exactly place that fear, you're not sure why it's there, but you listen to it. And you keep yourself quiet.

      I suppose in life, one just has to take things the good and the bad, ne? Some good, more bad. Sometimes even the good can never make up for the pain that the bad brings.     Otogi x Noa: Oh, and I have got mom to agree to let us board j00 and Liz(If it helps any) downstairs in our extra room(I suggest forcing you both into my room, so I'm the one in the poisonous spider room, I'll figure something out.) during KumoriCon for two nights or so. Knet Makri: Liz had to go back home. My mother shipped her off. . .>.> And she's planning on making me move to South Carolina with my dad. Otogi x Noa: O_O Otogi x Noa: Whoa, wait wait wait. . . Otogi x Noa: Rewind, and tell me 'bout all of what happened. Please? I CANNOT LET YOU MOVE AWAY. Knet Makri: Okay. . .Because I fell apart so much this week, my mother decided that Liz was bad for me. So, today, despite much protest, she put Liz on a plane home. Now, because of the same, she's decided that I need to stay with my family. But since I fight with her fiancee, I can't go with them. So she's sending me to South Carolina.   Preregistering for KumoriCon = $30.00 Playstation 2 = $220.00 Alicia moving farther and farther away as my downs bring ups for all of my other friends = Priceless.

      Well, I fell in love with this really awesome dots layout, so I think I may have to update this frequently. xD It's very very cute. I am only sad because I can't do the whole "mood" and "current music" option. :P Blergh. ::dances to her music:: Yes, I just wanted to say that. And I made my profile look all purty. ::loveeesss on this layout:: I wish my DJ could be this cool. I should try.
