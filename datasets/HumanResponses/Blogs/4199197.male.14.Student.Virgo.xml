      Damn kids are outside throwing rocks and those little poppy things. Im going to shove a firework in their schphincters if they interrupt my Sonic game one more time.  On a lighter note, I would like to point out that the comments on blogspot, unlike such shitbox sites as Xanga and LiveJournal, are open to anyone. So if you feel the need to write naughty stuff, go ahead because anybody can regardless of whether you are a member of the site.  owwww

        Who likes dead links? Not me!  So how about a page chock full of em. Also whoever is throwing rocks at my window late at night, please dont do that anymore. It makes baby Jesus cry.  The other day I tried to start a new phrase up.   'Youre out of control, go sit in the car'     Its the shit and the bomb. Its the shitbomb. Please try to throw it in once or twice in every sentence you use. And remember, uncle JJ sent you!

       urlLink Democratic Presidential Candidate Lyndon LaRouche: Campaign Website for 2004 I love this guy. When my school hosted all the possible democratic nominees these really sketchy looking guys with german accents and unibrows would hand out these hilarious pamphlets entitled 'Return of the beast man' featuring Dick Cheney. They must have been mentally ill or unable to understand english, because what was written in those books was basically a poorly done political satire.  Also, when the nominee wannabes had open questions, one of the questions was always 'Why wont you debate Larouche?" Those guys got taken away by security it was the shit.

       urlLink AOL Elections 2004: Straw Poll HAHAHA I laugh at this piece of shit. First of all, any party that gains the 'AOL' vote should be fucking ashamed. This is clearly not accurate whatsoever in comparison to an actual poll. Fucking Massachusetts is red. Massachusetts! It's a good thing most AOL users are too fucking stupid to read or write, or gays, women, minorities, the lower and middle class, and families of soldiers would have a tough time come November.

       urlLink Drew Curtis' FARK.com(It's the shit)  Here I go again, testing out the sweetness that is the Google Toolbar. How about that tiny font in the last post. This blogging business is hard. Who wants to bet after a few posts I lose interest in it. Betting on my lack of follow through is what we call a safe bet.

       This blogspot.com is a new and wonderful thing. I have the choice between 70 colors for my text! I wanted to have a place to write the shit that comes from my head, but I also didnt want to be an emo fag. I think that 'blogspot' is something a professional would use. Not a professional web designer, maybe a professional infant. I could have used Verdana but I went with Times new Roman, it really brings out the deep deep emotion that I feel more. And, oh no, I cant make indents for my paragraphs, how messy!       I can press the enter key which is nice. I am curious how people with no arms use a computer. Perhaps they have become skilled enough with their feet that they can use their feet to manipulate the keyboard. If that were the case, I would not invite that person to my house, I dont want their dirty stanky feet on my damn keyboard. Should there be apostrophes? Its so dark!      emo post:   I am so emotional. I enjoy writing sad poetry and cutting myself. Oh wait, no I dont, I dont enoy anything because I am an emo fag. I listen to sad music and hang out with sad people. I'm so sad that I have been born into this TERRIBLE EXISTENCE which requires me to go to school! and be around people! they just dont understand! My life in the suburbs pulling down a decent wage and driving a decent car is so terrible. oh boo hoo everybody be sad for me.           I hate people. I really hate everybody. The Internet is like a magnet for subhuman creatures. If only there were a device which allowed me to pimp slap people via the Web, I would give my middle nut for that privelege.      Peace, out.
