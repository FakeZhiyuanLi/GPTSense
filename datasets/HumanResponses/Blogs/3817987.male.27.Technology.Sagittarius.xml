      William Shatner has teamed up with Joe Jackson to cover the best song of the 90s Pulp's "Common People".  The result is mind bogglingly weird.  I don't know if it is bad or good!  You can listen to it in quicktime  urlLink here .

       urlLink     I was really impressed by  urlLink Kerry's speech  tonight.  He really delivered.  It wasn't the best speech of the convention (Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Sharpton were better), but it was the best speech I've seen Kerry give. He only went Franken-Kerry once or twice. And I was really surprised how effective stressing foreign policy was.  I was hoping he wouldn't stand back on the terrisom issue but I didn't expect him to actually do it.  Kerry gets it. Kerry really comes out looking like the candidate of optimism while Bush looks like a fear mongerer.    While he wasn't my first choice, Dean was my first pick and then Edwards won me over, I think he is proving to be the best choice to defeat the Arrogant Bastard and lead the country.

       urlLink      Whoa!   Sloth  is a forthcoming graphic novel by Gilbert Hernandez and it sounds really strange:   The story features a teenager who wills himself into a coma, wakes up a year later, and is physically slower than everyone around him. Now he has to adapt to his world and relationships with the people around him.  That has to be one of the weirdest ideas for a work of fiction in any medium ever. Go Beto!

      False advertising alert! All the songs are sung in English!   Anyway, you can always count of Lloyd to provide pretty mellow songs, but usually he provides a few up tempo rockier tunes as well.  But this album is all lovelorn ballads.  Is Lloyd too old to rock even in his shuffling Lloyd Cole way?  Maybe.  And if that’s the case kudos to him for sticking to what he’s capable of a excelling at and not embarrassing himself by trying to remake  Rattlesnakes  over and over again.  There is only one bona fide classic on the album the sad sad “No More Love Songs”, which starts off with these devastating lines:  “Rather than you,” she said, “I prefer solitude.” “Rather than company I prefer cigarettes”  That’s just brutal.  The rest of the album is great but does quite reach those heights.  “People Ain’t No Good” and “Late Night, Early Town” are personal favorites.  Lloyd has been doing this for 20 years now and he’s still on the top of his sophisto-pop game.

      I was discussing the strange British aperitif Pimms with FCW this morning and she wondered if it was available locally.  Trying to answer this question I found this nifty  urlLink tool  on the  urlLink Washington State Liquor Control Board site .  It's sort of like a public library catalog except for booze.  You can look up all the gins or vodkas or look for a specific brand.  The best part is it shows what liquor stores have it which is great for more obscure brands and it also tells you how many bottle each store has on hand!  Only thing missing the ability to place a hold on a bottle!  I'm not so crazy about the state monopoly on liquor sales but this sit is one benefit.  You couldn't get something like this with private liquor stores!  Now if they hadn't closed the Ballard Liquor store I might be picking up some Volk Kvint Vodka from Moldova tonight!

      For someone who is agnostic and at best vaguely believes in God, I really love old school gospel music.  This album was originally part of last year’s  Unearthed  box set, but i was too cheeap to buy that.  The whole album is just Johnny and his guitar singing songs his mother taught him as a child.  As always Johnny sounds like a God himself and really fills the songs with heart.

      Last night, I watched one of my favorite films Walter Hill's   urlLink The Warriors  .  I don't know when the first time I saw it was 6 or 7, but back then the idea of costumed gangs threatening to take over New York City was mind blowing.  After watching it again after all these years the costumed gangs are really silly but fun especially the  urlLink Baseball Furies , who all wear full baseball uniforms and carry baseball bats.  But underneath all the silliness are some cool action scenes and  a great Odyssesy-like story of the Warriors journey from the Bronx back home to Coney Island.  "Can you dig it?"  Hell yeah, I can dig it!  I also watched   urlLink Bus 174  .  What a harrowing and powerful film!  If you liked  urlLink  City of God  , I highly recommend this documentary.  America has plenty of problems but at least we aren't Brazil, which is simultaneously a first and third world country all rolled into one.

      After watching the first night of the convention I really think Kerry can win.  They are tacking to the center and stressing how Kerry will be tough on terrorism and his military experience and patriotism, all shown in relief of Bush. This is appealing to swing voters in the middle who think the Iraq was probable for the best but don't like how bush has handled it.  Some of this may piss off the far left but catering to the far left won't help win this election.  Plus the Anybody But Bush sentiment out there is so strong that most people on the far left wont care anyway.    Also watching Bill Clinton speak at the convention last night makes very much hate the 22nd Amendment.  Monicagate and all I think he would trounced Bush easily in 2000. And he would run way with it this time. I have really come to like Kerry but he's no Bill Clinton.

      I resisted this album at first.  After all, who wants a Belle & Sebastian sound-a-like that are also from Glasgow when we already have the original?  But the songwriting eventually won me over and the realization that they really aren’t aping B&S today so much as aping early B&S, since B&S has moved on to new sounds its nice to have the old sound back.  “Teenager” and “Suspended from Class” are the immediate stand out tracks and “Books Written for Girls” is a great denunciation of sensitive hipster boys.  Also, is  Underachievers Please Try Harder  not one of the best album titles ever?  If this album keeps growing on me at the pace it has over the last few months, then it may end up at the top of my annual top ten!

      While out with my folks and I this weekend, my brother found that  was  urlLink  ESPN NFL 2K5  had just been released with a regular price of $19.95, which is $30 cheaper than the forthcoming    urlLink Madden NFL 2005  , and apparently the entire 2K5 line will be similarly priced is which awesome considering how good their NBA and NHL games are.  I immediately proposed splitting the cost with my brother so for $10 each we bought a copy.  And the game is frankly awesome.  I may not even pick up  Madden  this year because as cool as the gameplay stuff on  Madden  is, the bells and whistles on 2K5 are hard to beat, especially the halftime and post game and highlights hosted by Chris Berman.  I should also add that in the games we played I defeated my brother by scores of 17-10 and 3-0.  Take that baby bro!

       Didn't blog over the weekend.  Why?  I have no idea.  Anyway here are a few notes.    Saturday  My dad and stepmother came to town.  I was nice to see them as it had been a while.  My dad was really enthused about politics and had many stories to tell about the state house  urlLink campaign  he is helping out with.  My dad may even run for state senate in two years.  Dad shared some really awful Republican jokes that were simulataneously stupid, offensive, and unfunny.  My stepmother was in good spirits and had some funny stories to tell about her daughter's post high school plans.  After efforting to get my dad to go out for Sushi my brother and I gave up proposed Red Mill and a compromise.  Burgers were good.  Then we went downtown and caught   urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  , which in spite of it's silly name is a excellent film.  How did Matt Damon escape the crapulance that is Ben Affleck's career?  Only afterwards did I realize that the director Paul Greengrass also did the awesome   urlLink Bloody Sunday  .    Sunday  After a restless night, I went over to Headstart's place for some nerd games.  My brother and his friend Cool Lee joined us for some   urlLink Illuminati  .  We played two games but neither were totally satisfactory because the winner of both won because of negligence on the part of other players rather than through real skill.  My own victory seemed especially hollow because I won through trickery which no one understood or saw coming.  Following the gaming I was pretty tired and ready for a nap and tried to weasel out of my evening plans with Headstart.  I ended up sticking it out for a while and we went to the College Inn and and Had grinders and played free pool.  I really enjoyed playing pool which is something of a rarity for me.  Usually I suck so bad its just not fun but this time I really tired hard. I played Best of seven against Headstart.  She swept me in four, but in all but one game it was close and I really had a shot to win.  I really want to play more pool!  After that I went home and watched another great episode of  urlLink  Six Feet Under  .  That show is really hitting on all cylinders this season and is really surprising me.

      I have a long long history with David Byrne.  Talking Heads’ album  True Stories  was the first album I bought with my own money that I’m not embarrassed to talk about.  But his last album,  Look into the Eyeball , was a bit of a let down; just more Talking Heads-ish rehash.  It sounded like Byrne was on autopilot.  I didn’t even know he had a new album out when I ran across this at Sonic Boom.  It’s a strange album as all most all the songs feature an orchestra and Byrne even does two opera songs.   But it really works as whole.  It doesn’t sound like Talking Heads; it sounds like David Byrne.  The best track is a cover of Lambchop’s “The Man Who Loved Beer”, which surpasses the original.  Other stand outs are “Dialog Box” is the first song about the internet that doesn’t suck after three listenings and “Empire” is a great political song that is affecting with out be trite.

      I love the world this morning.  I had a full 8 hours of sleep last night, which is a real rarity for me.  I had time for some cereal.  It is just beautiful outside.  All my busses were on time.  I was able to deposit my paycheck at the bank. It was lovely outside.  I got to hear Lonnie Smith talk about his early 80s cocaine addiction on the radio and then learned that Justin Leone talks like Rocky Balboa, a fact which amuses me to no end.  I had a perfect of coffee.  And now that I'm at work I get fairly fun stuff and then leave early at 3PM.   July 23rd 2004, will you marry me?

      Last night, I had my third consecutive night with no plans so I just relaxed at home.  After going for a nice walk and eating a chicken salad, I settled down to watch some Netflix.    I had to choices  urlLink  The Spy Who Came In From the Cold   and  urlLink  The Warriors  .  I had been looking forward to seeing both for some time.  I figured I could watch both in one evening no problem.  I watched  The Spy Who...   first but it was a let down.  It was not nearly as taut or exciting as most other John LeCarre stuff that I've seen or read.  Next was  The Warriors  which has been a personal favorite ever since I as a kid.  But when I slid the DVD out of its sleeve the dice was split in two.  It sorta ruined my nice evening!  Damn you Netflix!  The replacement copy you send me tomorrow better be mint!  Or I'll... do nothing I guess...

      I’m usually not all that into film scores but this one is really great. Almost as great as the movie it springs from, Brion’s piano and orchestral stuff are moving and delightful, although not as strange and inventive as his score to  Punch Drunk Love .  All gets even better when you throw in the pop perfection of ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky”, a weird Bollywood pop song, and Beck’s cover of Korgis’ “Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometimes”.  (Who are Korgis?  Hell if I know but this song has peaked my interest!) Additionally, there is a one Jon Brion song “Strings that Tie You” that nicely under scores the heart of film.

      I have been really loving beer of late.  Not just making beer my alcoholic drink of choice when going out for drinks, but really enjoying beer for beers sake.  Drinking beer because beer is good not because beer gets you fucked up.  Beer of all stripes too, from PBR to Heineken to New Castle Brown Ale to Guinness to yummy Chimay.    Mmmm beer.  As Franken-Kerry likes to say, "Bring...It...On!"

      More of the same from the Beta Band, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  They sound less like Radiohead than previously.  The lyrics are interesting if you listen to them, but the songs to blend into one big long indistinct track.  The song “Space Beatle” is pretty spiffy.  Over all its good “work music”, music to listen to while concentrating on other things, but I have no inkling to see these guys live that might be a snoozer.

      Nominally singles from last year's classic  Dear Catastrophe Waitress , these EPs deserve special mention for their b-sides.   I'm a Cuckoo  features a really exciting remix of the title track, "Stop, Look, and Listen" which sounds like a lost Monkees track, and "(I Believe In) Travellin' Light" a lovely little Stevie Jackson ballad.   Books  in features a double A-side of "Wrapped Up in Books" and the new "Your Cover's Blown", which is an ornate spy saga that sounds like a collaboration between Chic and Squeeze.  The lone b-side on  Books  is a adorable tune called "Your Secrets" which contains what may be the best single line in B&S history, "I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault".

      More like  Moon Safari  than  10,000 Hz Legend  and that's a good thing.  Languid French electronica that's both sexy and sterile.  Hooky but not overbearingly so.  The instrumentals "Alpha Beta Gaga" and "Mike Mills" (what does this song have to do with R.E.M. anyways?) stand out more than the songs with vocals. "Surfing on a Rocket" is at the top of the list for silliest song title of the year.

      I found a bunch of Fifth Dimension mp3s on usenet a few months ago and just now got around to listening to them.  This is some truly bizarre stuff!  The weirdest for me is "Sweet Blindness" which all about getting so fucked up on moonshine you go blind.  What the fuck?  Anyway here are the lyrics.  But it really should be heard to be believed.  If you are interested in hearing it let me know and ill try to hook you up.   Sweet Blindness   (Music and lyrics by Laura Nyro)   Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, get happy  Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, get happy Happy, oh sweet blindness, a little magic A little kindness, oh sweet blindness All over me, four leaves on a clover I'm just a bit of a shade hungover Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me  Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin' Down by the grapevine  Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin Mornin', oh sweet blindness A little magic, a little kindness Oh sweet blindness all over me Please don't tell my mother  I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me  (Don't ask me cause I) Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Wine, of wonder, wonder (by the way) Sweet blindness, a little magic A little kindness oh sweet blindness all over m Don't let daddy hear it  He don't believe in the gin mill spirit Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat  And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me, good to me And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me,

      Sometimes I feel like I am such a dork that I'll never be remotely cool.  But sometimes I hear things that remind me that I'm really not that big of a geek at after all.  For instance, my friend FCW is going to be maid-of-honor at a wedding this weekend and she just found out what the groom is giving to his groomsmen as thank you gifts; fancy sets of amethyst multi-sided dice.  Oh wait, they are properly called " urlLink Dwarven Stones ".  Not surprisingly the groom is a dungeon master and he and his friends play all day every Saturday and the bachelor party consisted of a weekend of gaming.    I may be a big dork but I certainly won't giving gold-plated Illuminati cards or emerald-encrusted Green Lantern rings to the members of my wedding party!

       urlLink    As a College Bowl veteran, I have watched with fascination the rise of Ken Jennings and his 30+ show winning streak on Jeopardy, especially since I found out Ken had been involved in  urlLink NAQT . Now there is a Ken Jennings  urlLink drinking game  to make that half hour of Jeopardy even more fun. This is the best part of the game:    The banter between Alex and Ken becomes disturbingly intimate. A few nights ago, one of KenJen's victims mentioned in the chat segment that if he beat the champ that night, he planned to get a tattoo of Alex Trebek in celebration. This anecdote inspired an odd KenJen riff about having 30-odd tattoos of Alex all over his body, one for each night of his winning streak thus far. A mental image like that one is definitely an excuse for a drink.   I think Alex totally has a crush on Ken.

       urlLink    Portland's best band ever has  urlLink new single  coming out in September with two new songs.  Woo!  If you haven't caught on to these guys you should now!  The music is a bit hard to describe; a bit baroque and a bit poppy.  Probably the only rock ben ever than can aptly be called Dickesian. Their first album  Castaways and Cut-outs  is one of the best debute albums ever.  And last year's  Her Majesty, the Decemeberists  is pretty cool too.  Their song "Angel, Won't You Call Me?" is now one of my all-time favorites,  Colin Meloy   is   the new Andy Partridge.

      I feel like a complete idiot.  My brother moved out in November and soon after his now empty room filled up with tons and tons of my crap: boxes of comics, books,  and records as well as empty boxes and other stuff.  After Christmas, I realized it had gotten out of hand and resolved to clean it up.  But I never did and it just got messier and messier.    So now its the middle of July and after I mopped my floors tonight I figured why the hell not lets do it.   And after all that procrastinating and pissing and moaning, how long did it take?  An hour!  One fucking hour! I now have nice clean storage room but I feel like an idiot because I could have had it 7 months ago!

      This weekend I watched the documentary  urlLink  Live Forever  , which is about the Brit Pop explosion of the mid-1990s.  It was a pretty solid film but there was one really interesting quote in the film from British critic Andy Savage to the effect that Oasis became more popular than Blur because they had more heart.  My initial reaction was no way that dude is crazy but upon further reflection Savage may be right.  Oasis's songs definitely have a hopeful you-and-me-against-the-world quality that Blur tends to lack.  Blur's songs tend to be more analytical and reflective especially in their earlier work.  Later Blur albums are considerably more emotional. Blur is still a better band in my book but Oasis is a more positive band.

       urlLink      Dan Clowes has topped himself once again.  I didn't think he could top "Icicle Falls" from the last issue of Eightball, which was better than both Ghost World and David Boring,  but his new story "The Death-Ray" is beyond praise.  I can't find the words to describe how good it is.  It's nominally a super-hero story about a boy named Andy and how he discovers his super-powers, but it is far more than that.  It really is a character study but to say more would spoil the fun.  And the art? It's puurrty!

      It is known far and wide that I blubber like a baby when ever I watch   urlLink Lilo and Stitch  .  The theme of family sticking together really gets to me.  And lately it has spilled over into other films with that theme.  Tonight it was  urlLink  A Little Princess   and   urlLink The Barbarian Invasions  .    Why does that theme get to me?  Maybe its the ups and downs of my family life in the past?  Maybe it was my family being there for my brother through a rough patch?  I really can't say,  but family really is a wonderful thing.  But from here on out please don't quote that line from  Lilo and Stitch  or I'll tear up.

      I just found the weirdest most mind blowing bunch of MP3s on a newsgroup.  They were labeled as being part of "Frank Balck Album", yes Balck not Black, and all the track titles were Pixies songs.  I figured what the hell and downloaded the lot of them.  The tracks them selves are pretty impressive.  They are experimental reworking of Pixies classics with new vocals from Frank.  At first I thought they were from some strange internet mash-up type thing but it turns out they are from the forthcoming album  Frank Black Francis , a collaboration between Frank and Two Pale Boys.    These tracks are really amazing.   Holiday Song  has a marching band arrangement,  Monkey Gone to Heaven  is a slinky almost bossanova tune, and  Nimrod's Son sounds like a deconstructed Residents song.  Their are lots of Jazz type arrangements and other weird stuff.  Frank's new vocals are awesome.  I can't wait to pick this up when it comes out legitimately!

      Of all the frighteningly geeky things that I have read on the net,  urlLink this treatise on Harry and Hermione  (sent to by Nono) has to be one of the most out there and unnecessary. This kind of well supported essay is about Harry's love life is disturbing in it's own right.  But who in there right mind ever even considered that Harry and Hermione could be a couple?  I mean Ron and Hermione is where its at!  They are like the Han and Leia of the Potter books!  And no I am not drunk! Ok I'll shut up now...

      Lincoln, my mother's 15-year-old black lab, was put down yesterday morning.  While it was clearly his time (he was having regular diabetic seizures), he will definitely be missed.  I'll miss his grumpy face always looking for pets, I'll miss his boundless energy and love for playing fetch, and I'll miss laughing at him hump his brother Harley in head; Lincoln was always evidence that homosexuality is genetic. I'm really glad I got see him one last time on Saturday and I'm glad he is no longer suffering.  I didn't expect this to upset me as much as it had been a long time coming (15 is ancient for a big dog), I had never lived with Lincoln like my brother, step dad, or mom and the death of his brother a few years ago didn't effect me deeply.  But last night, after talking to my mom about Lincoln's last hours I turned on the television only to see an adorable black lab named Little Morgan on the Great Outdoor Games jumping off a dock doing what Lincoln loved best playing fetch and was overwhelmed with grief and tears.

      I can now say that I have been party to the greatest video football game of all time.    For those you not in the know, NCAA Football 2005 has a Mascot Game option in which all players are replaced by the bulky team mascots.  I played as the University of Florida mascot  urlLink Albert the Gator  and my brother chose Oklahoma State's  urlLink Pistol Pete .   Team Pete jumped out to an early lead but Team Albert used its superior passing game to take a 23-22 lead at half time.  With 2 minutes left in the game Team Albert had a an impressive 39-22 lead.  But Team Pete overcame the odds and scored two touch downs and a two point conversion in the next minute.  Trailing by two with 30 seconds to Team Pete proceeded to march down the field and nail a game winning 37 yard field goal as time expired.  A mass of Pistol Petes rushed the field while and the Alberts shook their heads in despair.

      Last Night, I installed new cable boxes and in addition to the benefits of slim size (they now can fit on the shelf under my TV rather than on top of my stereo) and groovy new remotes, I now have the  urlLink  On Demand   service.  When I first heard about this I thought it was just a glorified pay-per-view but it turns out to be much more.    Its not just movies. There are TV shows as well and most of the TV shows are free!  And since I get HBO I have free access to all the HBO  On Demand   offerings.  Last night, Headstart and I watched two episodes of  urlLink  Da Ali G Show   and the best part was being able to pause the show in the middle to take a second to converse.   Its not as cool as TiVo but its still pretty nifty.

      I found another Netflix blog even better than the first one.  urlLink Hacking Netflix  is an essential aid to Netflix users.  The best feature is a weekly list of new releases on Netflix with links to the Netflix pages.  For instance out today are:    urlLink  Slasher  , a documentary about a liquidation car salesmen.  urlLink  Poker For Dummies  , something i desperately need to rent!  urlLink  The Dreamers  , Bertulucci art porn.  urlLink  Sherlock Holmes: Dressed to Kill  , which while im sure is fine film has a really funny title.

      My big plans tomorrow consist of going to Best Buy with my brother to buy  urlLink NCAA College Football 2005  and then heading back to my place to play it.  I can't decide if this is horribly nerdy or just a regular guy type of thing?  If it was a Star Wars game or a Zelda game that would clearly be geeky but the college football thing makes it more of a guy thing.  Thoughts?

But since I graduated from college (class of '99!) 5 years ago and my 10 year high school reunion is next summer maybe it the 90s really were a long long time ago!

       Anchorman  was all I had hoped it would be.  Will Ferrell  is  the funniest man since Bill Murray.  The movie didn't totally work plot wise, but it was ridiculously funny.  And  The Daily Show 's Steve Carrell almost stole the whole movie from Ferrell.

      Some of my friends and I have gotten caught up in the whole  urlLink poker  craze sweeping the nation.  After watching some  World Series of Poker  and  Celebrity Poker  over the weekend, we gathered last night to out our skills and I learned that I completely suck.  I am definitely not an undiscovered  urlLink Johnny Chan  or something.  I bet aggressively on shitty cards and quickly busted out.  I have had success in the past betting on horses and college football but I clearly folded in the heat of the moment.  Still I really had fun and I'm looking forward to playing again next month.  Maybe with time I won't suck and just be handing my money away to others.  Hmm but maybe instead of following the tenets of Kenny Rogers  The Gambler  I should use The Clash's  The Card Cheat  as my guide.  Actually, on second thought after reviewing the  urlLink lyrics  that is really not such a good idea.  "The gambler is seized and forced to his knees and shot dead."  Nope I don't want that in my future! :-)

      Warning clicking on this link could cause permanent mental scaring.  Behold the  urlLink Boardgame Players Association Board of Directors .  The group picture is bad enough but the individual pictures and bios below are the real horrors.    I had long thought that role players were worse than boardgamers but maybe that is not the case, at least at the extremes.  But don't worry if the name  Steve Jackson  makes you think of  urlLink this  or  urlLink this  rather than  urlLink this  you are likely safe from this fate.  I, on the other hand, should be very wary.

      I've been really down on my former hero Elvis Costello for the past few years.  His last few albums have really left me cold, but lately I've been listening to his albums and I don't think anyone's catalog can compare to Elvis's output from 1977 to 1986.  After that none of his albums are truly great.  There are some good songs here and there and some pretty solid albums but nothing on par with the golden years.    There is one exception; 1998's classic collaboration with Burt Bacharach  urlLink  Painted From Memory  .  Twelve perfect songs that are not like anything Burt or Elvis had done before.  Even songs that initially didn't grab me now are now classics.  Take for example the song   The Long Division . I love the semi-cheesy yet slinky Steely Dan vibe of the music.  And when you combine that with the near perfect  urlLink lyrics  you have one of the best songs about infidelity ever.  I mean my god! I think I have listened to that song 20 times already today!   Listening to this album makes me glad Elvis is still around and maybe a return to greatness is just around the corner and not just more mistakes like  urlLink  North   and inherently bad ideas like   urlLink Il Sogno  .

Anderson prequels, it is not up to the quality of the original Frank Herbert novels but it was still good fun.  Some of the threads are finally coming together and the Cymek and Zensunni story lines are no longer total bores.  The twists this book took at the end were really surprising and I'm definitely looking forward to  urlLink  Dune: The Battle of Corrin    , the final book in  The Legends of Dune  trilogy, which comes out next month.

      I spent a good portion of the 4th watching Rocky movies on AMC.  What the hell happened to AMC they used to show old classics but now it seems like all they show are cheese movies from the 80s.  I even caught  Star Trek IV  there the other day and I saw a promo for  Porky's !  The original  Rocky  was great as ever.  It is a truly great film deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.   Rocky II  is pretty sucky at least until the end when Rocky goes back in the ring.  Rocky's powder blue leisure suit was pretty cool though.   Rocky III  is awesome its got  The Eye of the Tiger , Mister T as Clubber Lang, more Apollo, Mick's death, and the most home-erotic hug between to heterosexual men in cinema history. You can see a small picture of the infamous hug  urlLink here .     Rocky IV   is  jingoist crap but its brilliant jingoist crap!  Its got the Cold War, Ivan Drago, Apollo's death, James Brown, and a crowd of Commie Russians cheering for Rocky.  Its almost as good as Top Gun.   Rocky V  was not as awful as I had remembered it but it wasn't that good either.

       urlLink This  brings back memories of going to Big K grocery with my mom and begging her to buy me one.  I saw  Spider-Man 2  last night.  It kicked ass and was a vast improvement on the first one.  I don't think it is the greatest super hero movie of all time, that honor goes to  Unbreakable  or  Superman II . Toby's Peter Parker was a bit more of a gloomy gus than he ever was in the comics.  Kirsten Dunst looked either horrid or beautiful depending on the scene.  Albert Molina ruled as Doctor Octopus and lots of cool stuff was set up for the next film with Harry Osborn and Dr. Curt Connors.

      On Wednesday morning, I witnessed a hideous orgy of public grooming.  I was sitting near the front of the bus and noticed an overweight 50ish man standing next to the driver.  He was wearing helmet and ill fitting bicycle shorts.  I was marveling at the seriously icky crotch sweat stains on his shorts, when I realized he was flossing.  After flossing he threw the floss on the bus floor and then reached into his fanny pack and produced nail clippers and proceeded to clips is yellowing s nails that from the sound they produced must have been very thick.  If that wasn't enough he then produced a little baggy of q-tips!  He prepped them by rolling the tips in his fingers to make the cotton all fluffy.  When he took them out of his ears,  I could clearly see that the tips were now a dark yellow hue.  I am now scarred for life.

      Last night I saw  The Corporation .  It a pretty impressive film.  The organizing principle of the film, "If corporations are legal persons then what sort of people are they?", was kind of silly but the detail on how corporations work was fascinating stuff.  And even though the film takes a far left anti-capitalist stance it  least gives the other side a chance to say their peace.  You have to respect a film that features both Noam Chomsky and Milton Friedman.

      Who the hell would write a song with that title?  Albert Hammond that's who.  Hammond is more famous for the song  It Never Rains in Southern California   and being daddy to one of the Strokes.    I found this song along with other weird stuff on a newsgroup.  It was with the rest of the 1974 and 1976 Dutch Top 40.  The Dutch liked some weird stuff.  The less said about the Al Martino's disco version of  Volare  the better.    I'm also now the owner of some George Baker Selection tracks other than  Little Green Bag  all of which suck.  How could a song called  (Fly Away) Little Paraquayo   not suck?  The sole gem of the bunch is The Walker Brothers  No Regrets .  That song is just amazing. sigh...

      American coverage of non-American football sucks.  Case and point is this AP  urlLink article  about the Iraqi men's soccer team's victory over Portugal yesterday at the Olympics.  While the Iraqi victory is a still big upset the article makes it seem like more than it really is by hyping the fact that Portugal made it to the Euro 2004 finals last month and leaving out the fact that this Portuguese team is not the same team!    The men's soccer in the Olympics limits teams to only 3 players over age 23, because FIFA could careless about the Olympics and doesn't want it tarnishing the uniqueness of the World Cup.  There is only one players from the regular Portuguese National team on the Portuguese Olympic team; Cristiano Ronaldo.  No Luis Figo, no Rui Costa, and not even the awesomely named Deco.  The Portuguese Olympic team does have a player named just Danny which is pretty cool.  But it's not the same team!    BTW I really think American sports should adopt the one name thing.  That shit is cool.  Thus far we only have Ichiro, but why not have just Barry or just Markus or just Terrell or just LeBron or just Carmello?

      The  urlLink FCC  is doing their really important work and has determined that scene in which Buffy and Spike (I refuse to call them Spuffy) fight and then dry hump with such force that they destroy a building is not indecent.    While the commission did not say that a "dry hump" is always within the bounds of the commission's rules on broadcast propriety, the panel did note that "both characters are fully clothed, and there is no evidence that the activity depicted was dwelled upon, or was used to pander, titillate or shock the audience."   I'm very glad they ruled against this complaint but sorry I for one  was  titillated and shocked!  I mean come on look at this:  urlLink     How is that not titilllating and shocking?

       urlLink     urlLink Stamps.com  now has permission to sell stamps with custom pictures on them. While I think its great that you can send stamps with your wedding or baby photos, the fact that I can create a stamp featuring a tattoo of a peglegged baby riding a bleeding sheep that the post office will consider valid postage is reason enough to end this practice.

      The Lashes are the bonvivants of the Seattle music scene and they have been more famous for their publicity stunts than for their music. The lead singer Ben is a former acquaintance of my brother and used go to parties my brother would throw in our Portage Bay apartment at 3 AM that always seemed to coincide with me having a big test the next day.  I know Ben from his clerking at Sonic Boom and he has always seemed like a cool guy in spite of his hipster haircut. I never knew what to think of the Lashes but I figured they'd be alright based on the music Ben had recommended to me and discussed at Sonic Boom. When I read in  urlLink  The Stranger   that they don't want to be indie rockers but what to be legit pop stars I knew I had to check out their new EP.  This EP shows the Lashes to be more than just alright.  They are verging on awesome, not to be hyperbolic.  There are just four songs and each is a pop gem.  I'm partial to "It's Your Party" and "Pop Song".  Its nice to know sometimes self-hype pays off and I am anxiously awaiting a full length album from these guys.  I highly recommend downloading the song "Death By Mixtape" from their label's  urlLink website .

      This morning my co-worker/friend FCW received a phone call from an irate man in California that demanded that she send some one to his house to help set up his internet connection. He either called the wrong number or was transferred incorrectly. She explained that she didn't have anything to do with that which caused him to rail against outsourcing, declare that he is a stockholder, and he deserves the customer service he wants.  He continued ranting for a while and eventually hung up on her. What a jerk. I've received lots of strange calls at work mainly owing to my common and boring name but most have been cordial misunderstandings.    Why do people have to be such assholes?  While I wish I worked in a more public service environment I definitely don't miss dealing with the assholes of the public.  At my job prior to this one people on the phone were always the worst.  People in person couldn't be too much of a jerk to your face but people on the phone would demand the most outrageous thing and then get mad when you told them you couldn't sketch out their entire family history over the phone for them.  So try to be nice to people on the phone.

       urlLink      The first time I saw  urlLink Sgt. Major  perform was at a Pop Festival at the Croc a few years back.  The entire band was decked out in white polyester marching band uniforms and the lead singer was wearing a black leather mini skirt a combination which I found irrevocably cool.  I've since seen them several time and each time they are better.  While its not surprising that I would dig a band made up of former members of the Fastbacks and Young Fresh Fellows, I still find the quality of the songs surprising.  Kurt Bloch is really writing some great songs in this band.  "The Battleship Called Greed" has a hypnotic baseline and a chorus that really kicks ass.  "Erase You" is cool almost metal rocker.  "Underneath It" is perfect power pop.  And I think their cover of The Model Rockets' "Cheaters" was concocted just to make me smile.  Sgt. Major are playing at the Sunset Tavern on Saturday Aug 14th.  I'll be there drinking PBR and you should be too.

      Bill Simmons sings the praises of   urlLink Varsity Blues  , which in my estimation is one of the best bad movies of all-time and even better if you are fucked up.

      Apparently the name Carl Newman isn't indie rock enough, maybe sounds to much like a janitor or something.  The first solo album from the front man of the New Pornographers and Zumpano is a real treat. It's both poppy and rocking.  "The Miracle Drug" is a pop gem and the cello on "The Town Halo" really rocks.  Yes, I said the cello rocks.  A great first solo effort for Carl, err, I mean A.C.

      Apparently Roger Ebert and Vincent Gallo have  urlLink settled  their on going feud over the film   urlLink The Brown Bunny  . Hopefully, this means Gallo will release Ebert from the gypsy curse he put on Ebert that caused him to suffer from some   urlLink Thinner  -esque wasting disease!  Also I think the  urlLink billboard  featuring a blow job, that Gallo has put up in Hollywood, is just wrong.  Although I still kinda want to see the film in spite of its reputation.  Gallo's first directorial effort   urlLink Buffalo '66   was great.

      The Bees are the only band I know of to hail from the  urlLink Isle of Wight  and they may be one of the least original bands ever, even more unoriginal than the White Stripes.  They are also verge on brilliance.  It’s much easier to believe they are some undiscovered 60s British band than a actual current band.  Their music recalls the Kinks, the Jam, the Who, and even The Beatles.  The retro factor is limiting because it makes it all seem like a glorified exercise in recreating the past that it distracts from the music itself.  The album gets off to a ridiculous start with “Chicken Payback”, which is a 60s style stupid dance song.  “Horseman” is a neat garage rocker with nice harmonies.  “Wash in the Rain” is the closest they get to contemporary and even then it still reminds me of the Small Faces.  All the rest of the songs are great but the album as whole while fun lacks heart.

      Back in 2002, when I heard that guitarist Graham Coxon had left or been fired from Blur my heart sank.  The Blur I knew and loved appeared to be no more.  How could Blur be good without Graham?  But when  Think Tank  came out last year, I was pleasantly surprised Blur was still excellent Graham or no Graham.  Maybe Graham wasn't that important after all?  Then Graham goes and puts out the great lost Brit Pop album!  Maybe he is the real genius of Blur? It's like he's channeling 1995.  "Freakin' Out" has to be one of the catchiest singles of the year.  "Bittersweet Bundle of Misery" is a typical Coxon Blur song but with better lyrics.  And "Bottom Bunk" is a weird Kinks-like song that I think is about self-pleasure.  All and all it is as good as anything Blur has done since The Great Escape and is one of the best albums of the year.

      Usually monday mornings are hell for me, but today was different.  I think the clean house, full nights sleep, and the fog all made this morning a wonderful thing.  I didn't have time to get coffee during my commute but that didn't matter.  Hopefully this is the start to a great week and not just some strange outlier.

      That is the   urlLink Diplomacy   order I some how failed to write that resulted in me completely blowing an chance I had of remaining in contention in this week's game. I went from controling five supply centers to one.  I really ought to be ashamed. BTW if you understood any of the above you are a big geek. Anyway, it was an otherwise excellent game with a full seven players.  Congrats to Kool Lee on the victory and to my brother and the Canadian for their second place tie.

      On Friday night, Headstart and I saw new  Manchurian Candidate  and it ruled!  Jonathan Demme is back!   While it wasn't as good as the original it was still a great film and in some ways a more complete and cohesive film.  All the changes worked and some really improved the weakness of the original.  There was nothing as brilliant as the Ladies' Garden Society scene though.  Denzel was great as was Meryl Streep.  Robyn Hitchcock was great in his small role and almost stole the show with his weirdness.  This was one of the few remakes that was worth making.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this film in my year end top ten list.  Also  Harold and Kumar  was an excellent stoner comedy!
