						   Well, to all my local readers, my summer school is taught by the local weather man, AJ Fox. Too bad it wasn't Kopi! :) Before I took the class, I thought he was going to be cool because he is on TV. But in reality, he is nothing more than a odd person. I say this because he is not too funny, and just kinda weird. He sure is not someone who I would be friends with. Then again, who really cares? I'm mean.   Some other issues on my mind. School. Okay, yes I'm in school now. But what about when I get my Bachelors? What will I do next? I wanted to be a teacher for a long time, but then changed my mind. For a couple reasons, but mainly for Seren. If I am a teacher, I will not be able to volunteer at her class. I will not be able to go on field trips with her. I will spend a lot of extra time working. Plus, will I really be a good teacher? So I decided that I would try to attend a Master's program at Fresno State (Early Childhood Education). I called a woman who is in charge of the program. She tried to tell me that I should not attend and get my teaching credential instead. Gee, thanks for the advice. On the other hand, I have people at work who tell me that I should go to school to get my Library Science degree, and become a children's librarian. But the question is, what do I want to do?

						   Well, it's the truth. And I have no news. I wanted this to be a journal, but do I really want to put all my private things on the internet? I do know that I do love to write, and this helps me do that....obviously. :)  Summer school starts tomorrow. Just this one class left and I will graduate! Yeeeeah hawwww! I will have my BS in Child Development. I guess that means I should be somewhat of an expert in children. I'm not so sure about that, but I can say with confidence that I do know a lot about the little guys. :)  I use to work at a daycare a few years ago. Today at the library (the new one), I saw two of the little ones who attended the daycare. They didn't recognize me, but I remembered them. Isn't it funny that I was apart of raising those two? So many young adults start off in a daycare setting, and so many I would not trust my own child with. I remember the first job I had at a daycare. I was in charge of 12 toddlers. I had to help potty train them and provide a stimulating curriculum for them at the same time. I was only 19, maybe 20. I was so young and "wet behind the ears". (Oh, I'm full of the sayings tonight!) If I could go back and be their teacher again, I would in a heartbeat. Poor kids. I wasn't bad, I had some idea of what I was doing, yet I had NO idea what I was doing. It's amazing that some have to leave their children in the care of adults who do not have the best training. At least I can say I always showed them love. :)  Goodnight dear friends.......

						   I wanted to give some props to my new friend Rochelle. She works at the library with me and she is so cool! She is the one who gave me the idea to start to blog! She is the Young Adult Librarian, and she has read many good books. So I wanted to share her blog with you (hope you don't mind Rochelle) and maybe you might like some of her readings.  http://rochelles.blogspot.com/    Also, I am working on getting some pictures. I wanted to add one tonight, but can't. Tomorrow!!

						   Okay, so I went to this training for work today. It was called FISH. It came from some famous fish place in Washington (I forget where), and the men there were tired of working so many hours. They hated their job. Somehow or another they decided to change their attitudes and have fun at work. So they made a lot of money by marketing this idea, and now they are famous. Oh, I bet they're happy now!! :) Anyway, the workshop was pretty cool. The people who put it on were great. One has lots o' energy and she rubs off easily on people!! :) The basic idea is to get us happy about work. It is our choice to be there and we can either make the best out of it, or piss and moan about our work. Either way, we have to do it. So it's better to be happy about it. Another concept is to have fun at work. Now I personally think that I am a happy person. I love to laugh (at my own stupid jokes), I always help patrons and I enjoy it. So I think that I already live by the FISH philosophy. However, some at the library do not. As soon as I got back to work, there were two fuddy-duddies who got mad at everything. It then occurred to me that I just can't let them get to me. (One of them is the one who didn't want me to bring Seren to work.) I have to let it go. It's not my fault that they are grouchy. All I can do is make myself happy. So great job FISH for helping me see that. Long live FISH!!!!

						   Today Seren and I went to the park. We went in the evening, when it was cool. Plus, I had to work in the morning. The whole time we were there I stayed by Seren so that she would not fall. She had a serious fall one time, and I like to stay close to her. Then I was looking around and noticed that no other moms stayed so close to their children. I started to worry. Am I smothering Seren? Is she going to think that she can't do anything on her own? I didn't stop her from doing anything, but I did stay behind her so that she didn't fall. After worrying about that, Seren and I strolled over to a different area. We then saw a little boy fall down, and he fell pretty hard. The mom waited before comforting him, then the dad said, "It's okay, walk it off. Is there any blood? No, then go play". I couldn't believe my ears. I didn't think that men really said that to boys. Then I started to wonder if Seren were a boy, would I stay behind her like I do? Would I comfort a boy like I comfort Seren? I don't know....just something to think about.   Today I had someone tell me that I should be a Children's Librarian. That was the 4th person in a week. I don't know about that. But then again, what am I going to do with this degree that shall be mine soon?! Just one more %#*@ing class!!!! Please pray I have the smarts and time to pass it. *Sigh* You know what I would like to do is teach a parenting class to teens. They could really benefit from something like that.   Well, Leno is almost on.......and I need some beauty sleep (no comments from the peanut gallery).

I is for the Impact you have made on me. K is for the Kindness I have learned from you. E is for the Extraordinary love you have given me.    Thank you, for I wouldn't be who I am today if it were not for you.

						   Today after work Seren and I spent some time together. She generally acts up after I get home. I think she just wants some alone time with me. So we went to WalMart, oh boy! Before I say how much fun we had, let me first say this......if your child cries, PICK IT UP! Children cry because they need something. I am tired of parents who just let their children cry. I just want to go up to the child and give him/her a big ole hug. While Seren and I were trying to pick out a pair of water socks (we settled on a pink Wiggles pair), this mother was pushing her screaming daughter along. The poor girl was crying like she needed love. Seren heard the girl and said, "oh baby". To which I replied with, "yes the baby wants to be loved". It didn't work, the mother just kept on pushing the stroller and looking for shoes. Okay, just so we are all clear here, you CANNOT spoil a child. Holding a child will not spoil it. Holding a child will only promote a healthy relationship, and will show the child how much he/she is loved. :)  The rest of the WalMart trip was filled with ways to try to entertain Seren. She smelled the fake flowers. :) We stopped by the toy aisle, where Seren picked out 5 or 6 stuffed animals. My favorite part was when she hugged Cookie Monster, a bright orange frog and a really soft bear all at the same time. She is learning how to love. And for the record, we put the stuffed animals back.  Right before Seren fell asleep, she gave me a kiss. She puckers her lips like she making the "F" sound. Too cute, and a great way to end the day.

						   I came home from work today with a smile on my face. :) I loved being at work. Today I worked at the new library in Fresno. Everything was new! The rows were clean, the books were clean, the carpet was clean, it all was clean. Everything was perfect. The people were friendly. I hate working with unfriendly people. I usually work with these type of people when I am at the Clovis branch. :( One co-worker had made me so mad that I am having a hard time getting past it. She didn't want me to bring my child into the library with me tomorrow. Granted, I'll be working (for only a couple hours doing decorating stuff), but I was going to bring someone to watch her. So this woman (who shall remain nameless only because I should show some respect), complained to a head staff member that I had better not bring my child with me. Okay, I understand that she does not like children, but for crying out loud.....it is a library!!!! Children should be able to come into the library!! I know I should be nice to her, but she has made me mad one too many times and I have had it. This is why I loved being at the new library today. Everyone is friendly and there is no back-stabbing.

						   I am a proud mother to Seren. She is my life. This is what everyone says right? It's true. Once you have children they become your life. She is. I love her like I never thought I could love another human being (or as my Grandpa says, "human frijole"). Everything I do now, I do for her. Is my life still my own? Yes and no. I do what I can for myself, but it is really all done for what is best for the family. So this is why I decided to be Serensmomma. :)

						    Today was the best day! Seren had so much fun, and she did some amazing things. While at my grandpa's Seren was walking on a bench. She would get to the end and want to jump off. So she would say, "for, eigh, nie, fie, go!" She does this because Dean will get with her and play this game with her where he holds her arms and counts to five, then lets her go. She loves it, and she obviously picked up on some of it.  Then later, my grandpa gave Seren a popsicle. She LOVED it! What made it so perfect was that she had the juice all over her face, then she had some dripping off onto her belly. The whole time she would be running through the sprinkler. Now that is what summer is suppose to be all about.  But the best is yet to come.  While I was cleaning up a little around the house, I gave Seren a paper and highlighter to play with. She was quietly drawing. I went to the kitchen, and Seren followed me. She layed on her belly, concentrating on what she was doing. I left, and when I got back, Dean showed me what Seren had been drawing this whole time. Believe it or not, she was drawing happy faces! They look perfect! She is not even 2 yet, and she is drawing 2 eyes and a smile. It looks like something Dean would draw. They are so cute. I just cannot believe it! It is so amazing! I think she is going to be an artist, well at least into the arts. She loves nature, the moon, flowers and she loves to take her towel off after she gets out of the bath! I see a drama queen in my future!! :)

						   Today I am at the Clovis Library. It's an alright night so far, but it's early yet. I am working with a grouch tonight. She needs a little love in her life, or something. This branch would be okay if more people were happier here. There is one other person who works here who is always mean-to us and the patrons. She drives me crazy. She hardly works and we have to pick up her slack. I wish the Librarian would say something to her, but she is his favorite. *sigh*   Yesterday I worked at the Fig Garden branch. It is nice there, close to my house, but some of the staff are cold, but at least polite. Last night there was one woman who was nice and talkative. It was a nice to have such a change. I love friendly people. :)   Some questions I hear at the library.   "There is a book I read 20 years ago, can you tell me what it was?"  "I read a book with a blue cover on it and I liked it, can you tell me which&nbsp;one&nbsp;it was?"  Phone call questions.  "What time is it?" I answered 10 (AM).&nbsp;"But what time is it in military time?" Uh.....10!  "Can you look&nbsp;up the word pedophile and tell me what it means?"  "What time&nbsp;do you close?"&nbsp;(9) "So if&nbsp;I&nbsp;bring back a book at 5, it will get checked in for today?"  Aye,yi yi!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  By the way....the steak was good, but a&nbsp;little cajun! :)

						   Well, it's been a while since I've written. I was sick and didn't feel like it. Sorry dear blog, I will not neglect you again. :) I have added my email to my profile, so feel free to go in and email me personally. I also added one more movie to my favorites. I have seen so many movies that I love, but I cannot think of any of them. So as I do, I'll add them.   I have two things down at the bottom of my page, that&nbsp;I am not sure anyone is aware of. One is the fresno family ring. This is a group of three (as of now) other moms. We are all apart of an Attachment Parenting group. So feel free to go to the list and check out their blogs.   The other thing at the bottom of my page is a weather pixie. I love it!! She changes her clothes with the weather. It keeps track of the weather here in Fresno. I tried to put her on my sidebar, but can't figure out how to do it. So it's easier to put it at the bottom. But if anyone can help me, please offer assistance. :)   Well, that's it for now.

						   The other night I had a dream about food. How bad is it when I am dreaming about food!!I specifically remember I was dreaming of a lemon bar with lots of frosting!!! It reminded me of the other day when I was at the mall. Some woman came up to me and asked me where In-N-Out was. Of course I knew where all of them were!! Then I thought good thing she didn't ask where the local health club was. I would have sent her 10 miles away, which is where&nbsp;the only one I know about is! She probably thought, "I'll ask the chubby girl, she'll know where all the good restaurants are." Well lady, the jokes on you, because I only know where some of them are! :)

						   I was sitting at FCC today and looked over to find the mailman delivering mail. He was eating something, a peach or something like that. He was dripping juice all over the place. He kept bending over to not get juice on himself, or the mail. He also loitered in the yard he was in. He took his time to have his snack. He then threw the pit on the person's lawn, and put their mail in the slot, with the same juicy hand he had been eating with. After he delivered the mail, he licked his grubby fingers. So next time I get mail that is sticky, I'll know why.   I should give the guy a break, after all, it was hot outside.   I guess I am too much of a germ-a-phob!

I did it first, then she copied me, two times. Later she did it on her own. Then a little bit after that she tried again, but missed a couple numbers. :) I love her so much!!!     &nbsp;   Oh, and by the way......Happy Birthday to me! :) Dean made me a cake tonight. How nice.     &nbsp;   Goodnight.

						    My boss told me a joke yesterday, so let me pass it on. No offense to those who are blonde.    &nbsp;  This brunet walked into the doctor's office. "Dr., Dr., you have to help me. Everywhere I touch on my body, it hurts."    &nbsp;  "Well, come in and let me see what the problem is," replied the Dr.     &nbsp;  So the woman touches her arm, and of course it hurts. She touches her leg, and it hurts. She then touches her head, and that too hurts. The doctor says, "You're not a brunet are you?"    &nbsp;  The woman replies, "Uh, no. I'm a blonde, but how did you know?"    &nbsp;  "Because your finger is  broken!! "    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  wacka, wacka

						    ....Jepoardy!    &nbsp;  I was talking with my aunt this evening, and we began talking about Jepoardy. If you even know how to turn the tv on, then you should know about the guy who is on a winning streak. He makes all of us look dumb. I think he has won enough money. And if he says that he needs more, let me send him my address. I could use some money. I have bills up the wazoo! I could use a good $5000. Oh, I'm in debt more than that (thank you student loans), but 5 grand will get me caught up with other little bills, and I can put $100. or 2 aside for a rainy day. :) I should do what that one kid did. I think some kid put his name on the internet looking for sponsers for college. Hey, can I have a sponser for life? I'm willing to wear Nike for the rest of my life. Heck, my daughter already has a pair of Nike sandals (and she's not even 2 yet). They were only $20.00, and I bought them back in April or May,&nbsp;and they still fit. Barely.     &nbsp;  Anyway, the guy still won.

						   I have someone special I would like to remember today. I visited him today. I wanted to write a poem, but frankly I suck at writing poems. Then I wanted to do something else that is special. None of that works. Let me simply say that I love him, and miss him. Now that I am a mom, it seems that I miss him more than I did before. All I have to say is that God makes some women strong.

						   Tonight we all went to the circus. :) We had so much fun! Seren loved it. She loved the clowns, elephants and flying trapeez. When they let go at the end, Seren noticed that they fell. She said, "Oh fall." Then her daddy told her it was a big fall, and she said, "Yeah, big fall!" It was great! Then when she got home, she stood on her stool and pointed to the floor and said, "oh big fall." She is so cute, and smart. But I am a little biased. :) It was so wonderful to see her clap, smile and laugh at it all. I can't wait till next year when we can get closer and stay longer. She will have so much fun.   It was a little sad to see the elephants doing tricks. It made me fell bad that I (actually my grandpa bought the tickets)spent my money to see it all. They added pigs, goats and cows to the circus. They had the cows jump over bars, like horses do. That was not natural. I felt sad to see that. We also saw a donkey that had stripes like a zebra. My friend called it a zonkey. :)The only way I can rationalize it all is to say that Seren had fun.

						   My husband and I like to watch Wheel of Fortune. Okay, I like to watch it. We always laugh because it never fails, some spouse always says, "I'm married to a wonderful man....," or "My beautiful wife..." One time we would like to hear, "Pat, I'm married to a big, fat, ugly, loser of a husband who made me come on this show so that we can win some dough and pay the rent." Now I would watch that show! It'll never happen.   In other news....Seren played with her friends today. We went to a playgroup and went swimming. Seren had so much fun! She jumped in the pool over and over. It's a big difference from our little patio, where all we have is a hose. I take that back, we have a little bucket Seren sometimes fills with water. But she only plays with the hose. Even at playgroup, Seren saw a hose by the pool and wanted to play with it. She's funny.   I'm learning more and more about posting things and changing my template. So I will soon be doing new stuff! Thanks to Rochelle for that. I work with her, and I love her! She is so great. She is awesome at her job, plus she's great fun to talk to. Thanks for the help Girl!! :)  Goodnight my friends.

						   Seren loves our cat. However, the cat does not reciprocate the feelings. The cat runs away when Seren wakes up, and comes out when Seren goes to sleep. We are seriously thinking about getting rid of her (the cat, not Seren). I mean seriously. I feel guilty about getting rid of her. She is apart of the family, sort of. The cat was around before Dean and I got married. She was here before the baby, but she doesn't like the baby. The cat is so anti-social. Sometimes she doesn't even like me or Dean. Is it wrong to get rid of her and get another cat? Then Seren and a new kitty can grow together. But what would I do with our present kitty? I do feel bad.   Your days here are numbered Shadee.

						   Well, Seren finally said my grandfather's name.....Papa! This was yesterday! I am so happy. My grandpa was too. He laughed. She also picked out her own clothes yesterday. Today too. She is turning into a young child with ideas of her own. I can't believe it. How was I so lucky to be in charge of her life?   Other news.....I don't have any. I keep meaning to write, but it gets late and I have so much other stuff to do. Then I fall asleep. But today I took a nap and I am UP!!! Well, sort of, I'm going to bed now. The Hubby calls, afterall it is 1AM. Yikes.  Goodnight all......

						   I saw this girl at Savemart yesterday. I wanted to save her. At first glance she looked like she was a dirty little girl. Then I looked at her closely. Her hair had been shaved recently, but it was growing back-in some areas. There were areas where it looked like it had fallen out, or had been pulled out. My first thought was that she had had lice and that was the only way to fix it. Then I noticed the loss of hair. She was probably 7 or 8. She was nothing but bones. He clothes were baggy and filthy. He feet where black. She was with a woman whom I can assume was her mother. There were three other girls. One was a teenager who was dressed okay. The teen was holding a baby. Then there was another girl who was probably 10 or so. The one who caught my attention looked like she had it worse off. It reminded me of the book "A child called it". The book is about a man who was abused as a child. He gave an example of one time when he went to the store with his mothers and brothers. He acted crazy because he knew his mother would not do anything to him in public. That is what this girl was doing. She was running through the store, with a smile on her face. I wondered, was she abused? Was the mother neglectful? The mother looked like a druggie. Why do women have children if they will not take care of them? Something was wrong with that girl. No matter what it was, I wanted to help her. I looked at Seren and she was eating a cookie with a smile on her face. I wish all children were happy. It makes me sick to think how some children are treated. I'm sad. I am hopeful that the girl gets out of that life. I pray that she is strong and will survive to become a wonderful woman. I have to be optimistic about it, otherwise it will make me sick. All I can do is love my daughter, and pray for all others.

						   Let me preface this next blog. This blog is mainly for me. Yes the pictures are for others, but the text is my journal. So I want to talk about Seren and some of the things she has been doing. I am not trying to tell others of how great she is (she is), or how smart she is (she is that too), but I am only documenting some of the wonderful things she has been up to lately. :)  Today at my grandparent's, grandpa gave Seren some money. I guess he is the only one thinking about her college education! :) Only kidding. Anyway, she was playing with the money. She counted it, "for, fi, ehh (eight)...". Then she began picking it up, holding it in one hand, while picking up the coins with her fingers. What great fine motor skills for the little one. I am so excited about it. The when we were leaving, she put the money in her pocket all by herself. When we got home, she put the money in her piggy bank. She saw the whole process. She knew where it came from and where it belongs. She knows it is hers now. I guess that means I have to actually leave it in there now. :)  Seren has been talking more lately. She repeats everything we say!! I now realize that I have to be careful. There are somethings that are said in this house that I do not want repeated. She announces when we burp or "faht", followed by a "pee u". That's my girl!   She has been growing so much lately, that I have forgotten all that I wanted to write about. Oh well, that means there will be more later.  :)

						   Today is the day that we celebrate our nations independence. More importantly, this is the day we see fire works. :) We were going to go somewhere and see some fireworks, but the place I wanted to go was closed. That didn't see right. So in a desperate act, I took Seren outside and searched the sky. Luckily, there were some people in our complex who were doing some fireworks. They were little of course, but Seren loved them!! She laughed and clapped after each one. I knew she would love them!!!

						   Well, I survived another Friday the 13th. Not that it matters, I'm not superstitious. However, I do have a black cat. Since I'm not superstitious it doesn't matter that I have a black cat. Work was a little hectic. We have had computer problems. I tell ya, we live and die by computers.  A good thing about yesterday? The Olympics started. I love the Olympics. When I was little I wanted to be in the Olympics. The only sport I thought I could be good at was swimming. I use to practice in my grandparents pool. When I say practice, I mean pretend to practice. I hardly ever went swimming when I went over there, I was too afraid of Jaws (but that's a whole other blog). I would try a couple butterfly strokes, and I mean a  couple . I don't know what it is about the Olympics. They are so fantastic. I always cry when someone wins. They work so hard to accomplish this dream, and then they actually do. It's almost romantic in a way. One day, even if I'm 90 years old, I hope to make it to an Olympic ceremony. To watch of course. :) The two events I'm really interested in this time around is women's soccer, and swimming.  Good luck to all!

						   I have a headache. I'm at work, so I guess that speaks for itself. We are having computer problems. So there are more people here than there are computers to use. I need to go to lunch. I'm mad because I was suppose to bring my video of Last Comic Standing, and I forgot it. I wanted to find out who won, but I guess I will have to wait until I get home.  I was looking at some other blogs recently. They are wonderful. There is a blog for everything. I might just find a whole bunch I like and link them so you all can look at them as well. Some blogs I have found have to do with sex (all kinds, and kinds you wouldn't think of), hurricane Charley, religions, people living in different countries, Bill Clinton even had one. I say had because he said he will not be doing it anymore. It's funny because all these people think that other people want to read about their lives. Who really wants to read about me? Family, friends? I guess it's a little egocentric, huh? :)

						   I have so much to say tonight and not enough time. It's late and I need to get up early tomorrow. So I will make this short and sweet (just like me). :) First off, I am extremely mad at AJ Fox. I tried to get my grade again today, and I found out that he did not turn them in. Hello!!!! Isn't that part of his job? We pay for him to teach us and to get our grades in on time. Thanks AJ.  On the other hand, I was happy at work tonight. This father and daughter came in and said thank you to me. Now I know that sounds silly, but I hardly ever hear thank you, especially from little kids. They have no manners. So when this guy said thank you, and he was so happy about the service he receives from the library, it made me happy. I guess I'm use to hearing people complain.  Okay, so I need to go to bed. I have ideas for my next blog......I should write them down before I forget. Here goes.  Boss Rules Blogs Weather  Goodnight dear Blog, sweet dreams.

						   Okay, I am so tired of the news lately. (I'm really in the complaining mood today.) All I hear about is Scott Peterson and Amber Frey. Okay, enough already. I say leave the poor woman alone. She didn't know that the guy was/is a sleeze ball. I actually met her here at the library. I feel sorry for her. She has all these people looking into her private life. To all the reporters and for the sake of woman kind, leave her alone. I think she has enough to deal with, without having her name and face in the news every night.

						   Okay, I am so mad at AJ Fox. He was suppose to have our grades ready for us on Monday. Today is Wednesday. Still no grades. I even spent 45 minutes of my day on Monday finding out that the grades were not posted. I even emailed him to see if he can just send me my grade. No, nothing. The least he can do is get back to me. Am I asking for too much? I think not.  I was also trying to add a cute picture to my profile, but I can't figure that out. Oh well. My cool co-worker Rochelle has helped me with lots of things with this blog, and I think she may have to help me with that too. I am going to try to set up some links, so we'll see how that turns out.

						   I took a book off of my favorites. It was  Spin Cycle . I realized that I just put it on there because I liked it, but it is not necessarily my favorite. So I want to only recommend books that I love, not a book that I feel luke warm about. Don't get me wrong, it made me laugh, but I can't even remember anything else about it.  All this to say that I updated my profile again. :)

						   I was at the park yesterday. Seren was petting a woman's dog (with her permission), and I was asking her about her cat and her children. As many of you know, we are having a problem with ours. This woman said that her kids love to play with the cat, and the cat doesn't mind in the least bit. What struck me as odd was that she was talking about how she lets her kids watch tv, and she instantly said, "I just let them watch a little." I was surprised that she was trying to justify her parenting to me, a complete stranger. I don't care how much tv her kids watch. I'm not here to judge her. God knows how much tv Seren watches. But is that what we are like? Are all parents worried about what other parents think about what they let their children do? (Yes) We are suppose to lift one another up, not criticize and judge. Don't get me wrong, I'm no perfect angel, I've judged people a time or two. Parents need support, and we have to feel like we can get it from one another. (Okay maybe not from strangers, but you catch my drift.)  Okay, I need to get back to work. They don't pay me to blog (but gosh, I wish they did!).

						   Yesterday I answered the phone at work and said, "Good evening Clovis Library, Tiffiny speaking, how can I help you?"  This is what I hear.  Caller-"Hi I have a calling card."  Me-"Okay."  Caller-"So do I dial an 800 number or just call the number directly?"  Me-"I'm not sure what you're asking?"  Caller-"I was wondering how I use it."  Me-"This is a Library."  Caller-"Oh, sorry."  Who exactly did she think she was calling.  One time I had a lady get mad because I didn't know what the post office hours were.  I know the library is suppose to be a source of information, but come on we can only do so much.

						   Well, today was my last class. I think I did good enough on the final to get a B in the class. Then I also got a letter stating that my graduation should go through okay. So I guess this is it. AJ Fox said that people who want to be weather forecasters, take a class like the one I took. So technically I am qualified to be a weather woman. I can predict the weather, after all, we did a 5 day forecast in class. That's it, I found my career. Let me see, it will be hot for the next 5 days. Temperatures in the 90's. See, it's an easy job. I'm well on my way to a successful career in forecasting.

						   Nothing new here. Tomorrow is my final for my summer class. That means I will offically be done with college, that is, if I do not go for my masters. I can't believe it, all this time and effort has finally paid off. I guess that means I have to now be a "grown-up" and join the real world.   Roses are red.   Violets are blue.  I'm through with college, now what will I do?

						    When I say cheap, I mean free!!!!       We took Seren to Petco (where the pets go). They had dogs all over the place. We took Seren in to see the doggies who wanted to be adopted, and she pet some. Then we went to see the fish and hamsters. We walked around the store and watched the dogs who were getting groomed. It was great!! We left without spending a penny. Yeah haw!! (Althought I think we are going to have to give in and spend some money to trade in the cat for a dog, but not till we move to a house!)      Seren and I went to a mommy and me playgroup today. It was so much fun!! She painted and played in the backyard. She loved it. The yard was covered with two huge trees that shaded the area. She played with other children. This is what I think is good for her. She needs to learn how to be social with other children. This is a great way for her to do it. I can't wait for her to make a friend. The woman who runs this, Tina, her daughter came up to Seren and held her hand. I thought it was so cute. :)       I love watching my child grow! Today she is exactly 2 months away from being 2!!!!!!!!!

						    Okay, let me clear the air here. I guess that the last post was a little on the down side, but it was what I was feeling. And let me say this, I do not think I let people walk over me. I guess I am just tired of people telling me that I have to be rude to someone who is rude to me, and if I am not mean back to that other person, then I am letting them walk over me. No that's not it, it's that I know my battles. What good will it do for me to tell someone to F-off? If someone makes me mad at work, why get into an argument with that person? I still will have to work with that person, and tensions will be high. I think that I am only being polite. That doesn't make me a door mat. Why sink down to their level? If there is ever a time when I need to do the right thing for myself, I will. I know when to say something, and when to take the higher road.      There, that's that.

						   No not to drugs, but to this show on HBO called  Six Feet Under , perhaps you've heard of it? The thing about it is that we don't have HBO. Dean was apart of this thing called Netflix. It was a pretty good deal. He found the first season of it on DVD, so we got hooked. The problem is that we had to wait almost a year to see the second season. Now I just finished watching the second season, and how long will I have to wait for season 3 to come out on DVD? This is what's wrong with society. We want things now, at least I do. I don't want to have to wait for anything. Instead of watching this show like a normal person, that is, one show a week throughout a season, I watched it all within a matter of a week or so. Talk about a glutton. *sigh* Anyway, it's a great show, about a family who runs a funeral home. It sounds morbid, but it's more about relationships than about actual death. Check it out, but keep in mind it's from HBO so there's sex, cursing and drugs involved.  You know I realized that all people want in this world is to be loved. It's all I want. I want to feel special and loved. I like to be liked by others. I like to make people happy. The other day I bought a homeless man a bottle water, and I felt bad I didn't get him something to eat. I felt so sorry for him. It was probably close to a 100 that day, and he looked like he could use something to eat. But I was at 7-11, and it didn't occur to me to get something other than water for him. I wonder how people let their lives get to that point. Does he have a drug or alcohol problem? Did his family throw him out? Does he have a family? What would be the one thing he would want to do over? What would be the one thing I would want to do over? I haven't lived that long, but I do have some regrets. Maybe not regrets per se, but more like missed opportunities. I know one thing that I wish I could change about myself....I wish I had more guts. I wish I had learned how to stand up for myself. I blame that on my step-father, a man who always shot me down. Maybe it's just who I am. Do I really let people walk over me, or am I just being nice? It's a fine line.  I know this is suppose to be my journal, but I think I have revealed too much. Now my soul is out there to be read by you all. Well, be nice and think nice thoughts. I actually like this whole idea of a blog. You know, some really cool people have blogs. Yup, it's true! :)  Take care dear blog, till morning........
