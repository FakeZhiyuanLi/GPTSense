      So I haven't told anyone that I have this out there yet so maybe it can be my breeding ground for totally random thoughts and weird stuff of the sort.  Man, I am so bored!  They did some construction at my work and I am now in an office all by my lonesome until my boss gets back from maternity leave.  It is so insanely quiet in there that I just can't stand it!  I need human contact during the day!  I'm thinking about trading my stang in for a used cheap-o car or truck.  I know that spells trouble but I bet it could save me a buttload in insurance cost and car payment!  I'm just so tight on cash lately...hence the website and no bar!  : )  If someone does see this give me some feedback on my little plan.  I was kind of thinking looking at a Malibu or something for if I traded in for new...but I guess those start at 19 MSRP.  Man oh man, can Chevy make a cheaper vehicle please!?  I need a little bit bigger...don't think I could go as small as a cavalier or whatever that new ugly ass one is that they have out.  Ok, that is all I can think to ramble about for now.  When I learn how to upload pics I'll put them on here as well so everyone can see how the house is coming along!  Tootles!

      I guess I should give an update on life in general, eh?  Ok, things are going pretty damn good down here.  We have not taken advantage of all the things Atlanta has to offer because, well frankly, we are too lazy.  We've been to a few Braves games (cuz Braves fans are just so fun), I have seen the zoo (what a pathetic excuse for a zoo!), and we've seen the WORLD'S LARGEST LASER SHOW at Stone Mountain Park.  Not too shabby I guess.  We need to get out and do more here in the near future.  We've met some excellent people down here that for some reason or another claim to have taken' a likin' to us!  We've gotten awesome home cooked meals at least once every other week if not more!  We've been to pool parties, stayed a long weekend at a lake house, and have had several all night poker games.  Did I mention I got to ride on not one, but two boats already!  I went fishing and got some bites!  I went innertubing (which is very hard when you have alligator arms)!  I also got lost in the North Georgia Mountains (oh yeah, that was an accident)!  We have definitely been spoiled by the crew we've met down here.  We moved into a house a few months ago and stopped dealing with that pesky rental house.  It is a neat house with a lot of personality but I'm getting really tired of cleaning up after the dogs on those wood floors!  And Jamie gets tired of cleaning up after me because I like throwing random things on the floor to piss him off.  I hope we don't get the basement done anytime soon because I'll have to start working part time at my job to keep that house clean!  We have a monstrous yard most of which is wooded.  It takes a good long while to mow but I need the exercise!  We have a lot of work to do on it but I guess that is a good thing.  It is hard for two impatient people to deal with though!  Other then that I guess I have work to talk about but no one wants to hear that story.  Just trying to make ends meet and afford bills and a social life! Ma be next time my posting will be more entertaining.  I'll try and type one when I've had a few!  : )

      Ok, that is my theme for the week.&nbsp; Ya know, I love busy work, just give me freakin' busy work!&nbsp; Don't have me sitting here inventing stuff!   Anyway, not all that much is new I guess.&nbsp; Jamie is getting ready to head out for Sturgis on a 2 week stint.&nbsp; I think 2 friends are going to switch off keeping me company at the house.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe we'll actually get stuff done!&nbsp; I'm really jealous that I don't get to go on a trip but I guess that is where hard work and determination gets you (damn, I'm so screwed, huh?).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'm still doing somewhat of a slow vehicle search.&nbsp; Thought maybe I'd start looking at older Jeep Wranglers.&nbsp; Depends on what is cheaper I guess.&nbsp; I'm sure, now that I think about it, that a jeep would be higher in insurance.&nbsp; They do look a little fun though and have more interior room then a truck would.   Think we are throwing a poker party this week.&nbsp; I hope this week goes better then last week's game.&nbsp; I need to remember to eat more before I drink all that beer and start doing shots...just bad man!&nbsp; Lost my ass (and was probably an annoying drunk in the meantime)!&nbsp; Think we'll set up another table with some other games for the poor folk like me that don't have much money to put into a game.&nbsp; I don't know if we'll have the basement done in time.&nbsp; Going to need some serious help to get it all done.   I don't know how well this story will translate via internet but I'll give it a shot.&nbsp; Poor old happy Pepper.&nbsp; Her back leg had fallen asleep after a long day of napping.&nbsp; Anyway, Jamie and I come home and she is trying too hard to be excited and puppyish.&nbsp; Well she just kept doing the splits with her back legs everytime she tried to get up.&nbsp; She even went to the water dish and drank while doing the splits with her back legs.&nbsp; We are bastards, we were laughing to hard to help her much.&nbsp; Then I grabbed her leg and somehow thought that continuous "shank shots" were going to help her.&nbsp; Whoops, sure didn't!   Anyway, should get back to the grind.&nbsp; Everyone have a good end of July!   I promise that I'll get pictures on here soon.
